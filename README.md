- The **sacred_obsidian_vault** folder is opened in Obsidian & is indexed.
  After indexing, these steps were taken in order for the vault
  to work with Quartz:
  - Open Obsidian Settings > Files & Links and look for these two items:
    - Set the New link format to Absolute Path in vault. If you have a completely flat vault (no folders), this step isnâ€™t necessary.
    - Turn on the Automatically update internal links setting.


- The root Quartz repo is then given access to the **sacred_obsidian_vault** by
placing this vault/folder inside **/content**.
