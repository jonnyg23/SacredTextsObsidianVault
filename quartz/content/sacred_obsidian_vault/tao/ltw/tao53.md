 <p>Even if one has but a little knowledge he can walk in the ways of the great Tao; it is only self-assertion that one need fear.</p>  
 <p>The great Tao (Way) is very plain, but people prefer the bypaths. When the palace is very splendid, the fields are likely to be very weedy, and the granaries empty. To wear ornaments and gay colors, to carry sharp swords, to be excessive in eating and drinking, and to have wealth and treasure in abundance is to know the pride of robbers. This is contrary to Tao.</p>
