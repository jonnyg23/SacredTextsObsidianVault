 <p>The thing that is well planted is not easily uprooted. The thing that is well guarded is not easily taken away. If one has sons and grandsons, the offering of ancestral worship will not soon cease.</p>  
 <p>He who practices Tao in his person shows that his teh is real. The family that practices it shows that their teh is abounding. The township that practices it shows that their teh is enduring. The state that practices it shows that their teh is prolific. The empire that practices it reveals that teh is universal. Thereby one person becomes a test of other persons, one family of other families, one town of other towns, one <a name="page_39"><font size="1" color="green">p. 39</font></a> county of other counties, and one empire of all empires.</p>  
 <p>How do I know that this test is universal? By this same Tao.</p>
