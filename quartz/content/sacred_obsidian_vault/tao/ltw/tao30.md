 <p>When the magistrate follows Tao, he has no need to resort to force of arms to strengthen the Empire, because his business methods alone will show good returns.</p>  
 <p>Briars and thorns grow rank where an army camps. Bad harvests are the sequence of a great war. The good ruler will be resolute and then stop, he dare not take by force. One should be resolute but not boastful; resolute but not <a name="page_26"><font size="1" color="green">p. 26</font></a> haughty; resolute but not arrogant; resolute but yielding when it cannot be avoided; resolute but he must not resort to violence.</p>  
 <p>By a resort to force, things flourish for a time but then decay. This is not like the Tao and that which is not Tao-like will soon cease.</p>
