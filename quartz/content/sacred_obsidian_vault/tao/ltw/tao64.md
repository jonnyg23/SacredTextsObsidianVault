 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><a href="index.htm"><img src="../img/t_yy.jpg"></a><br><i>Laotzu's Tao and Wu Wei</i>, by Dwight Goddard and Henri Borel, [1919], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">LXIV</h3>  <h3 align="center">CONSIDER THE INSIGNIFICANT</h3>  
 <p>That which is at rest is easily restrained, that which has not yet appeared is easily prevented. <a name="page_44"><font size="1" color="green">p. 44</font></a> The weak is easily broken, the scanty is easily scattered. Consider a difficulty before it arises, and administer affairs before they become disorganized. A tree that it takes both arms to encircle grew from a tiny rootlet. A pagoda of nine stories was erected by placing small bricks. A journey of three thousand miles begins with one step. If one tries to improve a thing, he mars it; if he seizes it, he loses it. The wise man, therefore, not attempting to form things does not mar them, and not grasping after things he does not lose them. The people in their rush for business are ever approaching success but continually failing. One must be as careful to the end as at the beginning if he is to succeed.</p>  
 <p>Therefore the wise man desires to be free from desire, he does not value the things that are difficult of attainment. He learns to be unlearned, he returns to that which all others ignore. In that spirit he helps all things toward their natural development, but dares not interfere.</p>
