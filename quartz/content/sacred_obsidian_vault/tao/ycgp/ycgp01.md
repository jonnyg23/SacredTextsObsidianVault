 <p>Y<small>ANG</small> C<small>HU</small>, when travelling in Lu, put up at Meng Sun Yang's.</p>
 
 <p>   Meng asked him: "A man can never be more than a man; why do people still trouble themselves about fame?"</p>
 
 <p>   Yang Chu answered: "If they do so their object is to become rich."</p>
 
 <p>   Meng: "But when they have become rich, why do they not stop?"</p>

 <p>   The ignorant, while seeking to maintain fame, sacrifice reality. By doing so they will have to regret that nothing can rescue them from danger and death, and not only learn to know the difference between ease and pleasure and sorrow and grief.</p>
