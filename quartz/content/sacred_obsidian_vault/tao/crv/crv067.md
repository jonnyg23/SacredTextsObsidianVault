 <p><a name="img_tao61"></a>
 </p><table align="LEFT"><tr><td align="CENTER" valign="CENTER"><img src="img/tao61.jpg" align="LEFT"></td></tr></table>1. A great state, one that lowly flows, becomes the empire's union, and the empire's wife.
 <p>2. The wife always through quietude conquers her husband, and by quietude renders herself lowly.</p>
 <p>3. Thus a great state through lowliness toward small states will conquer the small states, and small states through lowliness toward great states will conquer great states.</p>
 <p>4. Therefore some render themselves <a name="page_117"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 117</font></a> lowly for the purpose of conquering; others are lowly and therefore conquer.</p>
 <p>5. A great state desires no more than to unite and feed the people; a small state desires no more than to devote itself to the service of the people; but that both may obtain their wishes, the greater one must stoop.</p>
