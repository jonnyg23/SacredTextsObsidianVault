 <h3 align="CENTER">20. DIFFERENT FROM THE VULGAR.</h3>
 <p><a name="img_tao20"></a>
 </p><table align="LEFT"><tr><td align="CENTER" valign="CENTER"><img src="img/tao20.jpg" align="LEFT"></td></tr></table>1. Abandon learnedness, and you have no vexation. The "yes" compared with the "yea," how little do they differ! <a name="page_86"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 86</font></a> But the good compared with the bad, how much do they differ!
 <p>2. If what the people dread cannot be made dreadless, there will be desolation, alas! and verily, there will be no end of it.</p>
 <p>3. The multitudes of men are happy, so happy, as though celebrating a great feast. They are as though in springtime ascending a tower. I alone remain quiet, alas! like one that has not yet received an omen. I am like unto a babe that does not yet smile.</p>
 <p>4. Forlorn am I, O so forlorn! It appears that I have no place whither I may return home.</p>
 <p>5. The multitude of men all have plenty and I alone appear empty. Alas! I am a man whose heart is foolish.</p>
 <p>6. Ignorant am I, O, so ignorant! Common people are bright, so bright, I alone am dull.</p>
 <p>7. Common people are smart, so smart, I alone am confused, so confused.</p>
 <p>8. Desolate am I, alas! like the sea. Adrift, alas! like one who has no place where to stay.</p>
 <p><a name="page_87"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 87</font></a></p>
 <p>9. The multitude of men all possess usefulness. I alone am awkward and a rustic too. I alone differ from others, but I prize seeking sustenance from our mother.</p>
