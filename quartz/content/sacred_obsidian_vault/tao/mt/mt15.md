 <p></p><div style="font-size: 90%">What is born of the senses stupefies more than it stimulates. Man realizes himself only as he polarizes his sense organs in the spiritual, even as his spiritual faculties are polarized in the material; in other words, as he overcomes "the terrible spirit of duality within," described in Rom. vii, and prayed against in the invocation, "Lead us not into temptation," for the rainbow hues of earth blind the eyes to the translucent glories of heaven, its harmonies drown heaven's melodies, its</div>

 <p><a name="fn_37"></a><a href="mt15.htm#fr_37">21:1</a> viz.: Blue, yellow, white, black, red. Tung-tei-ning notes that the more the eyes see the more they desire. Cf. Eccles. i, 8.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_38"></a><a href="mt15.htm#fr_38">21:2</a> "Straus says that the five sounds in old Chinese were, C, D, E, G, A, and that they were the same with the five notes of old Scotch airs. The notes F and B are avoided."—China Review, vol. xiii, p. 12.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_39"></a><a href="mt15.htm#fr_39">21:3</a>) viz.: Sour, salt, sweet, tart, bitter. Cf. Eccles. vi, 7.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_40"></a><a href="mt15.htm#fr_40">21:4</a> "Desire is limitless and the cause of all trouble," says Tung-tei-ning. (Cp. ch. 64.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_41"></a><a href="mt15.htm#fr_41">21:5</a> "Because," says Wang-pi, "they lead men away from the straight path into byways full of obstacles."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_42"></a><a href="mt15.htm#fr_42">21:6</a> "The stomach serves, the eye demands service; therefore, the Sage discards the eye," is Wang-pi's explanation.</p>  
 <p>Wu-ch’eng says that when the spirit becomes dyed with the colors of the physical world, and feels impelled to investigate it, even to its frontiers, it loses its balance. It is because it is the eye that is chiefly the cause of this deflection that the chapter begins and ends with a condemnation of that organ.</p>  
 <p>Su-chêh aptly remarks that while the eye covets more than it retains, the stomach desires no more than it requires.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_43"></a><a href="mt15.htm#fr_43">21:7</a> Lit.—He withdraws from this and accepts that. Wang-pi sums up the teaching of this seven-fold chapter thus—"When the <a name="page_22"><font size="1" color="green">p. 22</font></a> ears, eyes, mouth and mind are subservient to the soul, all is well; but when it is otherwise, the spontaneity of man's nature is disturbed."</p>  
 <p>Chuang-tzu says: "A man who plays for counters will play well. If he stake his girdle (in which he keeps his loose cash), he will be nervous; if yellow gold, he will lose his wits. His skill is the same in each case, but he is distracted by the value of his stake. And everyone who attaches importance to the external becomes internally without resource." <i>Chuang Tzu</i>, by H. A. Giles, p. 234.</p>  
 <p>"The teaching of Lau-tsze comes here, and in the 13th chapter very near to that of Buddha."—<i>J. Edkins, D. D., China Review</i>, vol. xiii, 12,</p>
