"These are they which come out of the great tribulation, and they washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb." (<i>Rev</i>. vii, 14.) They ate the flesh and drank the blood of the Son of Man. (<i>John</i> vi, 54); and then in turn poured out their own blood for the thirsty and gave their own flesh to the hungry, thus filling up on their part "that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ." (<i>Col</i>. i, 24.) There is no alkali but this spiritual self-surrender, which finds its meat and its drink in doing the will of the Father (<i>John</i> iv, 34), which can wash our robes free of the stains of mortality, and make them pure with an incorruptible</div>

To attain to this not only is it necessary to know men but to know one's Self; not only is contentment required, but a vigorous- will, and "Ile that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death."

 <p><a name="fn_120"></a><a href="mt36.htm#fr_120">58:1</a> The discernment which gives knowledge of men by providing points for comparison produces the illumination which leads to self-knowledge. Su Cheh says that one can never know himself until he puts all distinctions on one side; a statement supported by Porphyry, who in his treatise on sensation says that the mind only sees itself when it regards objects, as ''the mind embraces everything, and all that exists is nothing but the mind, which contains bodies of all kinds." See <i>Encyc. Britt.</i>, 9th edit., vol. i., p. 461. Comp. also the teachings of Plotinus.</p>
