 <h3 align="CENTER">22.</h3>
 <p>22. 1. The partial becomes complete; the crooked, straight; the empty, full; the worn out, new. He whose (desires) are few gets them; he whose (desires) are many goes astray.</p>
 <p>2. Therefore the sage holds in his embrace the one thing (of humility), and manifests it to all the world. He is free from self-display, and therefore he shines; from self-assertion, and therefore he is distinguished; from self-boasting, and therefore his merit is acknowledged; from self-complacency, and therefore he acquires superiority. It is because he is thus free from striving that therefore no one in the world is able to strive with him.</p>
 <p>3. That saying of the ancients that 'the partial becomes complete' was not vainly spoken:--all real completion is comprehended under it.</p>

 <img src="img/06500.jpg">, 'The Increase granted to Humility.' This title rightly expresses the subject-matter of the chapter. I cannot translate the first clause otherwise than I have done. It was an old saying, which Lâo-dze found and adopted. Whether it was intended to embrace all the cases which are mentioned may be questioned, but he employs it so as to make it do so.</p>
 <p>'The emptiness' which becomes full is literally the hollowness of a cavity in the ground which is sure to be filled by overflowing water;--see Mencius, IV, ii, 18. 'The worn out' is explained by the withered foliage of a tree, which comes out new and fresh in the next spring. I have taken the first sentence of par. 2 as Wû Khäng does;--see his commentary in loc.</p>
