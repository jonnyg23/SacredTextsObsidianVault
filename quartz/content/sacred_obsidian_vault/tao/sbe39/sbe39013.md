 <p>6. The valley spirit dies not, aye the same;<br>
 The female mystery thus do we name.<br>
 Its gate, from which at first they issued forth,<br>
 Is called the root from which grew heaven and earth.<br>
 Long and unbroken does its power remain,<br>
 Used gently, and without the touch of pain.</p></dir>

This title rightly expresses the import of this enigmatical chapter; but there is a foundation laid in it for the development of the later Tâoism, which occupies itself with the prolongation of life by the management of the breath (<a name="img_05101"></a>

 <p>'The valley' is used metaphorically as a symbol of 'emptiness' or 'vacancy;' and 'the spirit of the valley' is the something invisible, yet almost personal, belonging to the Tâo, which constitutes the Teh (<a name="img_05102"></a>
 <img src="img/05102.jpg">) in the name of our King. 'The spirit of the valley' has come to be a name for the activity of the Tâo in all the realm of its operation. 'The female mystery' is the Tâo with a name of chapter 1, which is 'the Mother of all things.' All living beings have a father and mother. The processes of generation and production can hardly be imaged by us but by a recognition of this fact; and so Lâo-dze thought of the existing realm of nature--of life--as coming through an</p>

 <p>evolution (not a creation) from the primal air or breath, dividing into two, and thence appearing in the forms of things, material and immaterial. The chapter is found in Lieh-dze (I, 1 b) quoted by him from a book of Hwang-Tî; and here Lâo-dze has appropriated it, and made it his own. See the Introduction, <a href="sbe39003.htm#page_2">p. 2</a>.</p>
