 <h3 align="CENTER">5.</h3>
 <p>5. 1. Heaven and earth do not act from (the impulse of) any wish to be benevolent; they deal with all things as the dogs of grass are dealt with. The sages do not act from (any wish to be) benevolent; they deal with the people as the dogs of grass are dealt with.</p>
 <p>2. May not the space between heaven and earth be compared to a bellows?</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>'Tis emptied, yet it loses not its power;<br>
 'Tis moved again, and sends forth air the more.<br>
 Much speech to swift exhaustion lead we see;<br>
 Your inner being guard, and keep it free.</p></dir>

 <p>when the sacrifice was over, were thrown aside and left uncared for. Heaven and earth and the sages dealt so with all things and with the people; but the illustration does not seem a happy one. Both Kwang-dze and Hwâi-nan mention the grass-dogs. See especially the former, XIV, 25 a, b. In that Book there is fully developed the meaning of this chapter. The illustration in par. 2 is better. The Chinese bellows is different to look at from ours, but the principle is the same in the construction of both. The par. concludes in a way that lends some countenance to the later Tâoism's dealing with the breath.</p>
