 <p>The principle of TAO is easy to understand and easy to put into practice, yet in all the world how few there are who understand it and put it into practice. Every word of common people has its object; every deed has its actor, but because these talkers and actors are ignorant, TAO is ignorant with them and does not interfere.</p>  
 <p>Since very few people know TAO, TAO is the more worthy of esteem. Therefore, the perfect Sage clothes himself in the cheap garments of poor people but keeps TAO, like a gem hidden in his bosom.</p>
