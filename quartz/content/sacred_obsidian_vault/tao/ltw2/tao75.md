 <p>When a ruler appropriates too much of the taxes, starvation comes to the people. The reason why people are difficult to govern is because the ruler is thinking too much of his own interests. People make light of death because they are absorbed in the interests of life. The one who is not absorbed in life is wiser than he who esteems life.</p>
