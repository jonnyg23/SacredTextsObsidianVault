 <p>As the heavy is the foundation of the light, so the quiet is master of the passionate. Therefore, the perfect Sage in all the experiences of the day does not lose his serenity. Though he be surrounded by grandeur, he will keep himself unconcerned and simple.</p>  
 <p>But, alas, for those emperors, masters of ten thousand chariots, who, recklessly ambitious for power, have grasped after riches and thereby have lost control of their empires. If a king be reckless and flippant, he will lose the respect of his subjects; if he give way to passion, he will lose control of his kingdom.</p>
