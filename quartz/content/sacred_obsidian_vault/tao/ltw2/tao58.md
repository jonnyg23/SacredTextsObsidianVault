Therefore, the perfect Sage, though just himself, does not reprove another's injustice; though unselfish himself, he does not reprimand the covetousness of others; though he is straightforward, he does not offend others by disagreeable assertiveness; though wise, he does not make a show of his wisdom.</p>
