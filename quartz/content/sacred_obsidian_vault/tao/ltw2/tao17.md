 <p>A great ruler, first of all, ought to know the necessities and habits of his people. Secondly, he should keep in close touch with them and praise the meritorious ones. Thirdly, he should give reason for them to respect his moral earnestness. Lastly, he should resort to punishment only to bring home to them the disgracefulness of evil.</p>  
 <p>When a ruler lacks faith in his people, his people will lack faith in him. A wise ruler is always careful in his choice of words and because of it his people respect him and give him credit for the natural success of his admiration.</p>
