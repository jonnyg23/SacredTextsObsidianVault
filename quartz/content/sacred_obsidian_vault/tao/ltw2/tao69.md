 <p>It is taught in books of strategy: "Never be so rash as to start a war; at first, always be on the defense." "One should hesitate to advance an inch but be always ready to withdraw a foot." This means that it is better for an army to advance by craft rather than by aggressive operations. (It means for everybody) that there is a better way of attack than by hands, a better way of winning than by hostility, a better way of gaining than by resort to force. There is no greater mistake than to make light of an enemy. By-making light of an enemy many a kingdom has been lost. When well matched armies come to conflict, the army that regrets the hostility between them, always conquers.</p>
