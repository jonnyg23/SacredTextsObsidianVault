 <p>In regard to knowledge: the more one studies, the more he accumulates learning; while in regard to wisdom the more one practices TAO, the more his desires and thoughts are lessened, even to perfect emptiness of mind, all his innate excellencies will be developed and manifested. It is therefore necessary, if one is to keep control of his mind, to preserve its emptiness. But as soon as one desires to control his mind, he becomes incapable of doing so. It is by this spontaneous control of mind that the Sage gains the world's favor.</p>
