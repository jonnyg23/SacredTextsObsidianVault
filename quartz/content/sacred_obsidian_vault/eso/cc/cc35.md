 <p align="center"><i>William Wordsworth</i>.</p>  
 <p align="center">1770–1850.</p>  
 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">That</span> the mind of this writer (nearly if not quite a poet) in his loftier moods attained a very close neighborhood to Cosmic Consciousness, if he did not actually enter the magic territory of the kingdom of heaven, no one will deny who knows what these words mean and who also has read him with any sympathy. In fact the following short passages, from lines written at Tintern Abbey in his twenty-ninth year, prove as much. In the first he speaks of "that blessed mood"</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">In which the burden of the mystery,<br> In which the heavy and the weary weight<br> Of all this unintelligible world, <a name="page_286"><font size="1" color="green">p. 286</font></a><br> Is lightened:—that serene and blessed mood<br> In which the affections gently lead us on,—<br> Until, the breath of this corporeal frame<br> And even the motion of our human blood<br> Almost suspended, we are laid asleep<br> In body, and becomes a living soul.<br> While with an eye made quiet by the power<br> Of harmony, and the deep power of joy,<br> We see into the life of things [198: 187].</div></div>  
 <p>This passage indicates plainly the relief (approaching to joy) and the enlightenment (approximating illumination) which belong to the unrisen sun of the Cosmic Sense. But there is no evidence that upon him, at any time, the sun actually rose—that the veil was ever rent and the splendor let through; in fact it may be considered as quite clear that this did not happen. Then, next line, follows the usual doubt:</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">If this but be a vain belief</div></div>  
 <p>(whether or not the revelation can be relied on)—a question never asked, at least after the first few minutes or hours, by a person who has obtained even one glimpse of the "Brahmic Splendor."</p>  
 <p>Later, in the same poem, is another passage describing in other words the same mental condition, which may be properly called the twilight of Cosmic Consciousness:</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">                           I have felt<br> A presence that disturbs me with the joy<br> Of elevated thought; a sense sublime<br> Of something far more deeply interfused,<br> Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns,<br> And the round ocean and the living air,<br> And the blue sky, and in the mind of man—<br> A motion and a spirit, that impels<br> All thinking things, all objects of all thought,<br> And rolls through all things [198: 189].</div></div>
