 Attributed to, but probably not of Chaldean origin;
 not oracles (in the sense of <a href="../../pro/index.htm">prophecies</a>);
 and definitely not <a href="../../zor/index.htm">Zoroastrian</a>;
 this is a famous collection
 of aphorisms cherry-picked from classical sources.
 The earliest editions of the COZ were published during the renaissance,
 when Chaldea was a land of mystery to Europeans.
 Many of the cryptic 'Oracles' seem to reflect Neo-Platonism, 
 the Kabbalah and Gnostic views,
 which would have been considered heretical at the time.
 Claiming an ancient Chaldean origin might simply have been
 a flag of convenience.

 <p>
 The main text here was translated by the 19th century
 Neo-Platonist Thomas Taylor,
 and I.P. Cory in his <a href="../../cla/af/index.htm">Ancient Fragments</a>.
 This edition was published and introduced 
 by the Theosophist W. W. Westcott in his series
 <cite>Collectanea Hermetica</cite> in 1895.
 Despite the twisted background of this text, it has a definite
 resonance which students of the Esoteric will enjoy.
 Indeed, <a href="../../neu/yeats/index.htm">W.B. Yeats</a>,
 who moved in Theosophical circles, was an admirer of this text.

 <p>
 This is the first complete transcription of this edition of the COZ
 at sacred-texts.
 This version supersedes an earlier etext, prepared by a third party,
 which was incomplete and defective.
