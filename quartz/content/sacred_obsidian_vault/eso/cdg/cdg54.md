Moreover, I found out that the said girl had written to her lover outrageous letters, which were later discovered during the course of the investigation made by me in the same college on 25th May, A.D. 1565, in the presence of that man of eminent nobility and wisdom Constantine of Lyskerk, a most worthy magistrate, of John Altena formerly Dean of Cleves, of John Echte a most accomplished physician, and of my son Henry, doctor of philosophy and medicine, that these letters, however, were produced by her while possessed of the devil and not in her sound senses is open to no reasonable doubt." <small>TRANSLATED FROM "JOANNIS WIERI OPERA OMNIA," AMSTERDAM, 1660, PAGE 305.</small></p>
