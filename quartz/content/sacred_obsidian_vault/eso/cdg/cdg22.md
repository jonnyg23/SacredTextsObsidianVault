This chest he brought into his banqueting room; where, after it had been much admired by all who were present, Typho as it were in jest, promised to give it to anyone of them, whose body upon trial it might be found to fit. Upon this the whole company, one after another, got into it, but as it did not fit any of them, last of all Osiris lays himself down in it, upon which the conspirators immediately ran together, clapped the cover upon it, and then fastened it down on the outside with nails, pouring likewise melted lead over it.

 <p>The first who knew the accident which had befallen their king, were the Pans and Satyrs who inhabited the country about Chemmis; and they immediately acquainting the people with the news gave the first occasion to the name of <i>Panic Terrors</i>, which has ever since been made use of to signifie any sudden afright or amazement of a multitude."' PLUTARCH, "Isis AND OSIRIS," §13, 14. TRANSLATED BY SAMUEL SQUIRE, A.M.</p>
