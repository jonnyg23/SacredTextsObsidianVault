 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_UU">UU</a></font></span>A Master is an evolved being who has perfected a mental body <a name="fr_216"></a><a href="#fn_216"><font size="1">†</font></a> in which he can function consciously while out of his physical vehicle. A Master, through that degree of Divine Force <a name="fr_217"></a><a href="#fn_217"><font size="1">*</font></a> which his rapidly-evolving Solar Body enables him to contact, has power to understand and to apply many of the laws governing the so-called phenomena of Nature.</p>  
 <p>Dante Alighieri makes mention of his first meeting with his Master in these words, "for there appeared to be in my room a mist of the colour of fire, within the which I discerned the figure of a lord of terrible aspect to such as should gaze upon him, but who seemed therewithal to rejoice inwardly that it was a marvel to see. Speaking he said many things, among the which I could understand but few; and of these, this: <i>Ego dominus tuus</i> (I am thy Master)." <small>LA VITA NUOVA. TRANSLATED BY DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI.</small></p>
