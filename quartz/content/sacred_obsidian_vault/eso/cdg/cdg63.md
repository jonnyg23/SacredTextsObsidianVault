 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_AAA">AAA</a></font></span>Signifies in Hebrew fulness of knowledge. This name is used by Cabalists to denote Beings of that Heavenly Hierarchy ranking below the Seraphim, and charged with the duty of adjudging and of answering prayers according to the Law. Ezekiel thus describes them, "their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightenings." <small>EZEKIEL i, 13</small>.</p>
