 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_VV">VV</a></font></span>"Numa forbade the Romans to represent the Deity in the form either of man or beast. Nor was there among them formerly any image or statue of the Divine Being; during the first hundred and seventy years they built temples, indeed, and other sacred domes, but placed in them no figure of any kind: persuaded that it is impious to represent things divine by what is perishable, and that we can have no conception of God but by the understanding." <small>PLUTARCH, LIFE OF NUMA.</small></p>
