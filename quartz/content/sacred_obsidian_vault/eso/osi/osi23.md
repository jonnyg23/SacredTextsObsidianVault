 <p>The vandalism committed by Cæsar's soldiers in the destruction of the Alexandrian library has left us nothing but sculptures and inscriptions with which to reconstruct the religious history of Egypt. But that country was so directly allied to India that its ruins speak to us in a voice full of meaning, and its inscriptions are pregnant with significance, when studied from a Brahminical point of view.</p>  
 <p>We will merely mention, at present, one inscription taken from the Rahmesséum at Thebes, which is a complete summary of the doctrine of the Pitris, as herein set forth.</p>  
 <p>One of the first expressions that the Egyptian priests made use of in addressing those who had been passed through the process of initiation was as follows:</p>  
 <p>Everything is contained and preserved in one,</p>  
 <p>Everything is changed and transformed by three,</p>  
 <p>The Monad created the Dyad,</p>  
 <p>The Dyad begat the Triad,</p>  
 <p>The Triad shines throughout the whole of nature.</p>
