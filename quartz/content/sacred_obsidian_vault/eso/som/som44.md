 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">The Science of Mind, by Ernest Shurtleff Holmes [1926], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">JESUS AS A SAVIOUR</h3>  
 <p>Jesus stands forth from the pages of human history as the greatest Figure of all time. His teachings contain the greatest lesson ever given to the human race; and His life and works, while on earth, provide the grandest example that was ever given to man.</p>  
 <p>In the Higher Thought no attempt is made to rob Jesus of His greatness or to refute His teachings; indeed, the Higher Thought Movement is based upon the words and the works of this, the most remarkable Personality that ever graced our planet with His presence; and, until a greater figure appears, Jesus will still remain the great Wayshower to mankind, the great Saviour of the race.</p>  
 <p>Let us not waste time, then, in theological discussions which lead nowhere; but, following the example set before us, let us also do the works which He did. "The works that I do, shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father." <a name="fr_110"></a><a href="#fn_110"><font size="1">112</font></a></p>
