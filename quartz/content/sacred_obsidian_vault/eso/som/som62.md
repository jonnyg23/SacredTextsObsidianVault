 <p></p><dir>This I saw, or else some inner presence made it known to me;<br> The Universe is filled with life; the air, the sky, the sea<br> Teem with intelligence, with majesty and might;<br> And deep within me, some subtle inner sight<br> Beholds and sees, comprehends and knows the All,<br> Nor fears nor falters, but answers the Divine Call<br> To be as one beyond the bounds of time and space,<br> To overcome the bondage of the human race,<br> And leap, with trust undaunted, free,<br> Into the deeps of that Infinite Sea<br> Whose waters, calm, are ready to receive<br> Those, who in simple faith, believe.</dir>
