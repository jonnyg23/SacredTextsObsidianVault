 <p>1. About his diverse want of participation (gvî<i>d</i> akhvê<i>s</i>îh) with <i>his</i> parents this also is declared, that the demons, at an assembly of wizards, produced an outcry <i>for</i> a conference (ham-vâ<i>k</i>ô lâyi<i>s</i>nŏ) thus: 'That son of Pôrûshaspô is senseless and foolish <i>and</i> secretly corrupted; no one, man <i>or</i> woman, <i>will</i> consider <i>or</i> accept <i>him</i> as exalted.'</p>  
 <p>2. The tidings came to Pôrûshaspô, and Pôrûshaspô spoke unto Zaratû<i>s</i>t thus: 'I thought that I <i>had</i> begotten a son who <i>would</i> become a priest, a warrior, and a husbandman, and now thou</p>

 <p>6. Zaratû<i>s</i>t spoke to Pôrûshaspô thus: 'Thou mayst give <i>it</i> back to him who is thy protector <i>and</i> high-priest;' and he arose (âkhê<i>g</i>îd) <a name="fr_458"></a><a href="#fn_454"><font size="1">1</font></a> and went back to <i>their</i> place.</p>  
 <p>7. On the way, Zaratû<i>s</i>t gave <i>their</i> two horses water, on account of <i>their</i> thirst; and he thought thus: 'Unprofitable was my going to the residence of the Karaps, except <i>in</i> this manner, when, through giving water to the horses, my soul <i>was</i> then expanded.'</p>
