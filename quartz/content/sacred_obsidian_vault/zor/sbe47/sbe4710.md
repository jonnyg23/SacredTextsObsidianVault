 <p>1. About the marvellousness which is manifested after the departure (vîkhê<i>z</i>ŏ) of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, whose guardian spirit is reverenced, to the best existence, <i>and</i> in the life<i>time</i> of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp.</p>  
 <p>2. One <i>marvel</i> is this which is declared by revelation, about the provision of a chariot <a name="fr_220"></a><a href="#fn_220"><font size="1">3</font></a> by Srîtô <a name="fr_221"></a><a href="#fn_221"><font size="1">4</font></a> of the Vîsraps <a name="fr_222"></a><a href="#fn_222"><font size="1">5</font></a>; this is through a famous wonder and</p>

 <p><a name="page_78"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 78</font></a></p>  
 <p>the coming of a report about the marvellousness of that chariot to Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, Vi<i>s</i>tâsp's begging that chariot from Srîtô, and Srîtô <i>saying</i> in reply to Vi<i>s</i>tâsp: 'That chariot is for a righteous man, <i>in</i> which the soul of Srîtô in the life<i>time</i> of Srîtô's body <a name="fr_223"></a><a href="#fn_223"><font size="1">1</font></a>, <i>and</i> that of that man in the life<i>time</i> of his body, come visibly together once in the worldly existence.' 3. And the soul of Sritô, through the generosity of that Srîtô, presents that chariot to the eyesight of that man of righteousness; thereby it becomes evident he had seen <i>it</i>, and is told not to act in another manner. 4. The exalted Kaî-Vî<i>s</i>tâsp, as becoming from revelation more particularly aware of this marvel about the future at that time, and for the sake of this marvel being published to the worldly existence (gêhânîgîh), and of <i>his</i> becoming</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_79"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 79</font></a></p>  
 <p>more invoking <i>for</i> the supremacy of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping religion, became discernible by those of the realm, is sought for, <i>and</i> is most attended.</p>  
 <p>5. A great wonder became manifest to Vi<i>s</i>tâsp and those of the world, just as revelation mentions thus: 'Thereupon the archangels are letting forth the soul of that <i>Srîtô</i> from the light of the supreme heaven, from the light on to the earth created by Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; <i>and</i> the soul of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp proceeded from him into the light to meet <i>it</i>. 6. Vi<i>s</i>tâsp proceeded on to the propitious south (rapîtvînŏ); he <i>was</i> producing more gain than the gainers, and he was more inquisitive than the inquisitive; to all whom he saw he spoke, and unto such as spoke he listened; when he gazed at them looking simultaneously they stood up, <i>and</i> obeisance <i>was</i> offered by them unto the soul <i>and</i> person of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp.'</p>  
 <p>7. Immediately upon that no delay occurred until <i>there</i> came on at a run—<i>besides</i> the soul of Sritô of the Vîsraps—the most horrid (agrandtûm) of demons, from the horrid northern quarter of the horrid destroyer (za<i>d</i>âr), that was himself black, and his deeds, too, were very black. 8. And as he comes himself, so also he grumbles to the soul of Srîtô thus: 'Give a maintenance (khvârag) <i>to</i> Vi<i>s</i>tâsp who is thy driver <a name="fr_224"></a><a href="#fn_224"><font size="1">1</font></a>, for the sake of good fellowship and service, and for that, righteousness is suitable unto a pure <i>one</i>; do not <i>give it</i> as a thing which is protective (that is, do not <i>give it</i> for the sake of worldly gratuity), <i>but</i> for love of the righteousness which is owing to the perfect existences.'</p>  
 <p>9. When those words were fully heard by Srîtô of</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_80"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 80</font></a></p>  
 <p>the Vîsraps, the early bestower (levînŏ-vakhsh), he stood still and so he spoke in words thus: 'For righteousness I give thee, O mighty Kaî-Vi<i>s</i>tâsp this chariot which is without a driver, only for love of the righteousness which is owing to the perfect existences.' 10. As much for righteousness as is best for righteousness, and as much for the soul as is best for the soul, the gift of the whole <i>was</i> secured (that is, its acceptance <i>was</i> announced as often as three times).</p>  
 <p>11. Then that chariot became two chariots, one spiritual and the other worldly; in the worldly <i>one</i> the exalted Kaî-Vi<i>s</i>tâsp travelled forth unto the village of the Nô<i>d</i>ars <a name="fr_225"></a><a href="#fn_225"><font size="1">1</font></a> in the joyfulness <i>of</i> good thoughts, and in the spiritual <i>one</i> the soul of Srîtô of the Vîsraps travelled forth unto the best existence.</p>  
 <p>12. One <i>marvel</i> is this which is declared that in fifty-seven years onwards from the acceptance of the religion <i>by</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t <a name="fr_226"></a><a href="#fn_226"><font size="1">2</font></a>, the arrival of the religion is published in the seven regions <a name="fr_227"></a><a href="#fn_227"><font size="1">3</font></a>; <i>and</i> within the life<i>time</i> of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, the circumstance (aê<i>d</i>ûnŏîh) is manifested by the coming of <i>some</i> from <i>other</i> regions to Frashô<i>s</i>tar of the Hvôbas <a name="fr_228"></a><a href="#fn_228"><font size="1">4</font></a> for enquiry <i>about</i> the</p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_81"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 81</font></a></p>  
 <p>religion, <i>even</i> as revelation mentions thus: 'Two whose names are thus, Spîtôî<i>s</i> <a name="fr_229"></a><a href="#fn_229"><font size="1">1</font></a> and Arezrâspô <a name="fr_230"></a><a href="#fn_230"><font size="1">2</font></a>, who have hastened unto Frashô<i>s</i>tar of the Hvôbas in search of wisdom.'</p>  
 <p>13. Thus much splendour and wonder of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp <i>and</i> those of the realm regarding Zaratû<i>s</i>t <a name="fr_231"></a><a href="#fn_231"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and thus much due to the coming of the archangels from the sky to the earth before Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, as evidence about the true prophesying of Zaratû<i>s</i>t <a name="fr_232"></a><a href="#fn_232"><font size="1">4</font></a>; and that, too, about Pêshyôtan <a name="fr_233"></a><a href="#fn_233"><font size="1">5</font></a>, the chariot of Srîtô <a name="fr_234"></a><a href="#fn_234"><font size="1">6</font></a>, and other subjects seen written above, <i>are</i> declared by the Avesta, which is the same that they accepted from Zaratû<i>s</i>t, as the culmination <a name="fr_235"></a><a href="#fn_235"><font size="1">7</font></a> (<i>a</i><i>v</i>arîgânîh) of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>'s words. 14. And if this splendour, glory, <i>and</i> wonder that <i>are</i> written above as regards <i>what</i> those learned <i>men</i> of the realm saw—which <i>are</i> in the statement revealed by the Avesta—<i>had</i> not occurred, king Vi<i>s</i>tâsp and those learned <i>men</i> of the realm would not have seen what this Avesta had revealed to them—which <i>was</i> thus much splendour and wonder reported by it to them—<i>and</i> not one word about leaving <i>its</i> preservation to us would be annexed.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_220"></a><a href="sbe4710.htm#fr_220">77:3</a> Pahl. r<i>â</i><i>ê</i> which is written exactly like the Pahlavi ciphers for twenty-two and, no doubt, stands for Av. ratha.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_221"></a><a href="sbe4710.htm#fr_221">77:4</a> So spelt ten times in §§ 2-11, but here Srâtô. It is also Srîtô in Dk. V, iii, 2.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_222"></a><a href="sbe4710.htm#fr_222">77:5</a> Pahl. Vîsrapân in §§ 9, 11 and Dk. V, iii, 2; but here it is <a name="page_78"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 78</font></a> Visrapân, and in § 7 the first letter is omitted, leaving only îsrapân. In Pahl. Vd. XX, 11 (Sp.) we have Srît-î <a name="img_07800"></a>
 <img src="img/07800.jpg"> (in L4), which latter name may also be îsrapânŏ, though more likely to be read Sêr<i>z</i>ânŏ when considered by itself. It is almost certain that the person mentioned in Pahl. Vd. XX, 11 is intended to be the same as that named here in the text. But it is doubtful if this person be the Av. Thrita son of Sâyu<i>z</i>dri (or Sâi<i>z</i>dri) of Yt. V, 72; XIII, 113. As the legend in the text appears to refer to the soul of Srîtô, or Thrita, revisiting the world to meet Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, this Srîtô may have been the warrior Srîtô, the seventh brother, employed by Kaî-Ûs, about 350 years earlier, to kill the frontier-settling ox of that time, but there seem to be no means of so identifying him with absolute certainty.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_223"></a><a href="sbe4710.htm#fr_223">78:1</a> This is the literal meaning of the Pahl. 'mûn rûbân-î Srîtô pavan zîndagîh-î Srîtô tanŏ,' but it is not quite consistent with Srîtô's return to the earth as a spirit. The Indian copyists seem to have observed this, as they have omitted several words, so as to alter the meaning to the following:—'That chariot is for a man of the righteous, <i>with</i> whom Srîtô in the life<i>time</i> of that <i>man's</i> body comes visibly together, &amp;c.' But the sentence is not quite grammatical.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_224"></a><a href="sbe4710.htm#fr_224">79:1</a> This speech seems intended as veiled irony.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_225"></a><a href="sbe4710.htm#fr_225">80:1</a> Nô<i>d</i>ar (Av. Naotara) was a son of king Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar (Bd. XXXI, 13) and an ancestor of king Vi<i>s</i>tâsp. Vi<i>s</i>tâsp being a descendant of Kaî-Kavâ<i>d</i>(Bd. XXXI, 28, 29) who was the adopted son of Aûzôbô (Bd. XXXI, 24) a son of Zâgh, son of Ma<i>s</i>vâk, son of Nô<i>d</i>ar (Bd. XXXI, 23 corrected from XXXIII, 5). Hûtôs, the wife of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, was also of the village of the Nô<i>d</i>ars (Yt. XV, 35).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_226"></a><a href="sbe4710.htm#fr_226">80:2</a> That is fifty-seven years after the conference of Zaratû<i>s</i>t (see Chap. V, 1).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_227"></a><a href="sbe4710.htm#fr_227">80:3</a> See the summary in Dk. VIII, xiv, 10:—'Likewise, about the communication of Zaratû<i>s</i>t's knowledge of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping religion to the world, his attracting mankind to the religion, <i>and</i> the ages, after Zaratû<i>s</i>t, until the renovation <i>of the universe</i>.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_228"></a><a href="sbe4710.htm#fr_228">80:4</a> Av. Ferashao<i>s</i>trô Hvôgvô (Yas.

The Hvôvas (Pahl. Hvôbas) were a numerous family.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_229"></a><a href="sbe4710.htm#fr_229">81:1</a> Av. gen. Spitôi<i>s</i> (Yt. XIII, 121). He was high-priest of Frada<i>d</i>afsh, the south-east region.</p>
