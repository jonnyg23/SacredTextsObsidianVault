 <p>1. About the wonderful striving of the fiend for the destruction of Zaratû<i>s</i>t. 2. When it became near to his birth, the Fever demon, the Pain demon, and the Wind demon of Aharman, each one with 150 demons, have come out to kill Zaratû<i>s</i>t, <i>and</i> from his spirit they have gone forth to his mother. 3. And she is hurried from there by Fever, Pain, and Wind; and at <i>the distance of</i> one league (parasang) <i>there</i> was a wizard, Impudent (Storkŏ) by name, who was the most medical of wizards; in hope of practice he stood up from his seat, as she stopped in her progress.</p>  
 <p>4. A messenger <i>of</i> Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> uttered a cry thus: 'Do not go to a wizard! for they are not healing (bêshazinî<i>d</i>âr) for thee; but go back to the house, wash <i>thy</i> hands on the morrow with cow's butter held over the fire, also burn (tâpŏ) <a name="fr_427"></a><a href="#fn_423"><font size="1">1</font></a> firewood</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_141"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 141</font></a></p>  
 <p><i>and</i> incense for thy own self <i>and thy</i> progeny which is in thy womb.' 5. And she acted accordingly and became well <a name="fr_428"></a><a href="#fn_424"><font size="1">1</font></a>; <i>and</i> the co-operators of the demon, <i>and</i> those of equal power, who <i>had</i> not obtained their remedy from her body, are again exposed <a name="fr_429"></a><a href="#fn_425"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and spoke thus: 'On account of the existence of fire from all sides we have not succeeded; <i>it is</i> a help for every one who is her friend more than opponent; therefore it was not for us, because of the power within her.'</p>  
 <p>6. The same night as she gave birth, Aharman selected commanders and arrayed his champions (gû<i>r</i>d); there are <i>some</i> who <i>are</i> with one thousand demons, and there are <i>some</i> who <i>are</i> with two thousand demons; pursuing <i>and</i> attacking they have contended. 7. The opposing stand <i>of</i> the sacred, beings <a name="fr_430"></a><a href="#fn_426"><font size="1">3</font></a>, especially of the glory itself at the family <a name="fr_431"></a><a href="#fn_427"><font size="1">4</font></a> fire, was manifest at that birth; and for its splendour and brightness (pa<i>d</i>rôkŏ), settled opposite a distant place, they have then found no remedy.</p>  
 <p>8. At last, Aharman sends Akômanô <a name="fr_432"></a><a href="#fn_428"><font size="1">5</font></a> on, and spoke to him thus: 'Thou canst be very spiritual, who canst be most intimate; thou canst go with deceit into the mind of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, and make him turn</p>  
 <p>

 <p><i>his</i> mind to us who are demons.' 9. And Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> sends Vohûmanô on against him; Akômanô advanced to the front, <i>and</i> had come forward to the door, <i>and</i> wished to go inside.</p>  
 <p>10. Vohûmanô schemingly (<i>k</i>ârakŏgarîhâ) turned <a name="fr_433"></a><a href="#fn_429"><font size="1">1</font></a> back, and exclaimed to Akômanô thus: 'Go inside!' 11. Akômanô imagined thus: '<i>There</i> is nothing to be accomplished by me of what <i>was</i> mentioned to me, for Vohûmanô has gone back.' 12. And Vohûmanô went inside, <i>and</i> mingled with the reason (vârôm) of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, <i>and</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t laughed outright <a name="fr_434"></a><a href="#fn_430"><font size="1">2</font></a>, for Vohûmanô is a gratifying spirit.</p>  
 <p>13. Also seven wizards <a name="fr_435"></a><a href="#fn_431"><font size="1">3</font></a> were seated before him, <i>and</i> owing to the light in the dwelling, his <i>having</i> laughed at birth was conveniently seen, which is opposed to the <i>habit</i> of the rest of mankind who cry out at birth <i>and</i> are quite terrified.</p>  
 <p>14. Also, at the same time of birth, he authoritatively accepted the religion from Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, as it is stated in revelation, that he spoke at birth thus: 'As is the will of the spiritual lord (ahvô) mayst thou be who art the officiating priest (zôtŏ) (that is, mayst thou be the leader of the creatures) <a name="fr_436"></a><a href="#fn_432"><font size="1">4</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>15. As Zaratû<i>s</i>t, on account of his worldly body, spoke with a worldly voice, Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke <i>in</i> reply to him, on account of the spirits, thus: 'So</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_143"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 143</font></a></p>  
 <p>mayst thou be the priestly authority (ra<i>d</i> shâe), and so mayst thou be virtuous, owing to whatsoever righteousness <i>occurs;</i> and I confidently proclaim <i>thee</i> righteous (that is, I am thy controller) <a name="fr_437"></a><a href="#fn_433"><font size="1">1</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>16. Another day, Pôrûshaspô went and enquired of the wizards who kept in front at the place, thus: 'What is the <i>cause</i> when infants cry out at birth, beyond that <i>which occurs</i> when they laugh out-right <a name="fr_438"></a><a href="#fn_434"><font size="1">2</font></a>?' 17. And they replied thus: 'Because <i>those who</i> are made to cry <i>have</i> seen mortality as <i>their</i> end, <i>and those</i> having laughed <i>have</i> seen their own righteousness.'</p>
