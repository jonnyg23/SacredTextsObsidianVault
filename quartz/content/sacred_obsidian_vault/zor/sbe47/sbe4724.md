 <p>1. About the trials (aûzmâyi<i>s</i>nŏ) which occurred</p>  
 <p><a name="page_145"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 145</font></a></p>  
 <p>to him whose practice <i>was</i> lawful, and the signs of prophecy <i>that</i> are seen therein, <i>it</i> is thus declared, namely; 'Another day, when <i>the child had</i> been born, Pôrûshaspô called one of those five brothers of the race of Karaps, and spoke thus: "Fully observe the marks <i>and</i> specks of my son Zaratû<i>s</i>t."'</p>  
 <p>2. <i>The Karap</i> went <i>and</i> sat down before Zaratû<i>s</i>t, and the head of Zaratû<i>s</i>t <i>was</i> thereupon severely twisted by him, in order that he should be killed; <i>but</i> he, being fearless, watched the wizards whose terror <i>was</i> distressing <a name="fr_445"></a><a href="#fn_441"><font size="1">1</font></a>. 3. As <i>it was</i> in those ten nights for hospitality, Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> sent Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i>, Arêdvisûr, and Ar<i>d</i>âî-fravar<i>d</i> <a name="fr_446"></a><a href="#fn_442"><font size="1">2</font></a> down to the earth, by way of female <i>care;</i> thereupon no variation occurred to <i>the child</i>, and, further, the hand of that Karap <i>was</i> withered <a name="fr_447"></a><a href="#fn_443"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and that wizard demanded the life <a name="fr_448"></a><a href="#fn_444"><font size="1">4</font></a> of Zaratû<i>s</i>t from Pôrûshaspô for the harm from him, which sprang <i>upon</i> him<i>self</i> from his own action.</p>  
 <p>4. <i>At</i> the same time Pôrûshaspô took Zaratû<i>s</i>t, and gave him to the Karap, that he might do with him according to his own will. 5. He seized him and threw him out, at the feet of the oxen who were going on a path to the water; the leader of that drove of oxen stood still in <i>his</i> vicinity, and 150 oxen, which walked behind it, <i>were</i> kept away from him thereby; <i>and</i> Pôrûshaspô took <i>him</i>, and carried him back to the house <a name="fr_449"></a><a href="#fn_445"><font size="1">5</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>6. Also the second day, <i>the Karap</i> threw <i>him</i> out</p>

 <p>at the feet of the horses; and the leader of the horses stood still in the vicinity of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, and 150 horses, which walked behind it, <i>were</i> kept away from him thereby; <i>and</i> Pôrûshaspô took <i>him</i>, and carried him back to the house <a name="fr_450"></a><a href="#fn_446"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>7. Also the third day, firewood is gathered together by <i>the Karap</i>, and Zaratû<i>s</i>t is deposited on <i>it</i> by him, the fire is stirred up by him, yet <i>with</i> the same result (ham-bûn-i<i>k</i>), the <i>child</i> is not burnt by it, and those marks, which existed <i>and were</i> made upon him, <i>were</i> a preservation from it <a name="fr_451"></a><a href="#fn_447"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>8. And the fourth day, he is thrown by <i>the Karap</i> into the lair (âshyânakŏ) of a wolf; the wolf was not in the lair, <i>and</i> when it wished to go back to the den (sûrâkŏ), it stopped when it came in front of some radiance, <i>in</i> the manner of a mother, at the place <i>where its</i> cub was. 9. In the night, Vohûmanô and Srôsh the righteous brought a woolly (kûrû<i>s</i>akŏ) sheep <i>with</i> udder <i>full</i> of milk into the den, and it gave milk to Zaratû<i>s</i>t, in digestible draughts (guvârakŏ guvârakŏ), until day<i>light</i> <a name="fr_452"></a><a href="#fn_448"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>10. In the dawn, the mother of Zaratû<i>s</i>t went to that place, in the expectation that it <i>would</i> be necessary to bring a skeleton out of the den, and the woolly <i>sheep</i> came out <i>and</i> ran away; his mother supposed that it was the wolf, and she spoke thus: 'Thou <i>hast</i> devoured to repletion; mayst. thou endure for ever without it!' 11. She went farther, <i>and</i> when she saw Zaratû<i>s</i>t quite safe, she then took him. up and spoke thus: 'I <i>will</i> not give <i>thee</i> to any one during life, not though both the provinces of Râgh and Nô<i>d</i>ar <i>should</i> arrive here together <a name="fr_453"></a><a href="#fn_449"><font size="1">4</font></a>.'</p>

 <p>12. Because these <i>princes were</i> among the spiritual from two provinces which <i>are</i> in Âtûr-pâ<i>d</i>akân, such as <i>are</i> at sixty leagues (parasang) from <i>K</i>îst: Zaratû<i>s</i>t arose from Râgh, and Vi<i>s</i>tâsp from Nô<i>d</i>ar. 13. And of these two provinces, Râgh was according to the name of Êrikŏ, <i>son</i> of Dûrêsrôbô, <i>son</i> of Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar <a name="fr_454"></a><a href="sbe4725.htm#fn_450"><font size="1">1</font></a>, from whom arose the race of Zaratû<i>s</i>t: and Nô<i>d</i>ar <i>was</i> according to the name of Nô<i>d</i>ar, <i>son</i> of Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar, from whom arose the race of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp.</p>
