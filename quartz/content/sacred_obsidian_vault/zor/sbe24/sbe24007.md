 <p>religion, (4) forth from which this, <i>which </i>is such a source of wisdom, is a selector <a name="fr_35"></a><a href="#fn_34"><font size="1">1</font></a>. 5. Through the glory and will of the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i><i>who is</i> promoting the prosperity of the two existences <a name="fr_36"></a><a href="#fn_35"><font size="1">2</font></a>(6) and of all the greatly powerful angels, (7) and <i>through</i> the completely calm repose of the sacred beings, the princely <a name="fr_37"></a><a href="#fn_36"><font size="1">3</font></a>, purpose-fulfilling sages, (8) presentations of various novelties for the appropriation of wisdom, (9) through largely acquiring reasoning thought <a name="fr_38"></a><a href="#fn_37"><font size="1">4</font></a>, are most wholesome for the body and soul <i>in</i> the two existences.</p>  
 <p>10. As in the pure marvel of marvels, the unquestionable and well-betokened good religion of the Mazda-worshippers, by the words of the creator, Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, and Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtamân <a name="fr_39"></a><a href="#fn_38"><font size="1">5</font></a>, it is in</p>

 <p>many places decided, (11) that he, who is the all-good creator, created these creatures through wisdom, (12) and his maintenance of the invisible revolutions <a name="fr_40"></a><a href="#fn_39"><font size="1">1</font></a> is through wisdom; (13) and the imperishable and undisturbed <i>state</i>, in that which is immortality <i>for</i> ever and everlasting, he reserves for himself by means of the most deliberative <a name="fr_41"></a><a href="#fn_40"><font size="1">2</font></a> means of wisdom. 14. For the same reason <i>it</i> is declared, (15) that <i>there</i> was a sage who said, (16) that 'if this be known, that the religion of the sacred beings (ya<i>z</i><i>d</i>ân) is truth, and <i>its</i> law is virtue, and <i>it</i> is desirous of welfare and compassionate as regards the creatures, (17) wherefore are <i>there</i> mostly many sects, many beliefs, and many original evolutions <a name="fr_42"></a><a href="#fn_41"><font size="1">3</font></a> of mankind? 18. And, especially, that which is a sect, law, and belief, causing harm to the property (khêl) of the sacred beings <a name="fr_43"></a><a href="#fn_42"><font size="1">4</font></a>, and is not good? 19, 20 <a name="fr_44"></a><a href="#fn_43"><font size="1">5</font></a>. And this, too, <i>one has</i> to consider, that, in order to become a chooser in this matter, trouble is to be undergone; (21) and it is necessary to become acquainted with this matter, (22) because, in the end, the body is mingled with the dust, and reliance is on the soul. 23. And every one is to undergo trouble for the soul, (24) and is to become acquainted with duty and good works; (25) because that good work which a man does unwittingly is little of a good work, (26) and that sin which a man</p>

 <p>commits unwittingly amounts to a sin in <i>its</i> origin <a name="fr_45"></a><a href="#fn_44"><font size="1">1</font></a>. 27. And <i>it</i> is declared by the Avesta <a name="fr_46"></a><a href="#fn_45"><font size="1">2</font></a> (28) thus:] <a name="fr_47"></a><a href="#fn_46"><font size="1">3</font></a>" Nothing <i>was</i> taken by him by whom the soul <i>was</i> not taken (29) hitherto, and he takes nothing who does not take the soul (30) henceforward likewise <a name="fr_48"></a><a href="#fn_47"><font size="1">4</font></a>; (31) because the spiritual and worldly <i>existences</i> are such-like as <a name="fr_49"></a><a href="#fn_48"><font size="1">5</font></a> two strongholds, (32) one <i>it</i> is declared certain that they shall capture, and one it is not possible to capture."'</p>  
 <p>33. After <i>being</i> replete <i>with</i> those good actions <i>of</i> <a name="fr_50"></a><a href="#fn_49"><font size="1">6</font></a> which <i>it</i> is declared certain that it is not possible to capture, (34) and when he <a name="fr_51"></a><a href="#fn_50"><font size="1">7</font></a> surveyed the incitement for this, (35) he started forth (fravaftŏ), in search of wisdom, into the various countries and various districts of this world; (36) and of the many <a name="fr_52"></a><a href="#fn_51"><font size="1">8</font></a> religions and beliefs of those people who are superior in their wisdom he thought and enquired, and he investigated and came upon <i>their</i> origin <a name="fr_53"></a><a href="#fn_52"><font size="1">9</font></a>. 37. And when he saw that they are so mutually afflicting (hanbêshin) and inimical among</p>

 <p>one another, (38) he then knew that these religions and beliefs and diverse customs, which are so mutually afflicting among one another in this world, are not worthy to be from the appointment of the sacred beings; (39) because the religion of the sacred beings is truth, and <i>its</i> law is virtue. 40. And through this he became without doubt that, <i>as to</i> whatever <a name="fr_54"></a><a href="#fn_53"><font size="1">1</font></a> is not in this pure religion, <i>there</i> is then doubtfulness for them in everything, (41) and. in every cause they see distraction.</p>  
 <p>42. After that he became more diligent in the enquiry and practice of religion; (43) and he enquired of the high-priests who have become wiser in <a name="fr_55"></a><a href="#fn_54"><font size="1">2</font></a> this religion and more acquainted <i>with</i> the religion, (44) thus: 'For the maintenance of the body <i>and</i> preservation of the soul what thing <a name="fr_56"></a><a href="#fn_55"><font size="1">3</font></a> is good and more perfect?'</p>  
 <p>45. And they [spoke <a name="fr_57"></a><a href="#fn_56"><font size="1">4</font></a>], through the statement [from revelation, (46) thus: 'Of the <a name="fr_58"></a><a href="#fn_57"><font size="1">5</font></a> benefit which happens to men] wisdom is good; (47) because it is possible to manage the worldly <i>existence</i> through wisdoms, (48) and it is possible to provide also the spiritual existence for oneself through the power of wisdom <a name="fr_59"></a><a href="#fn_58"><font size="1">6</font></a>. 49. And this, too, is declared, that Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> has produced these creatures and creation, which are in the worldly <i>existence</i>, through innate</p>

 <p>wisdom <a name="fr_60"></a><a href="#fn_59"><font size="1">1</font></a>; (50) and the management of the worldly and spiritual <i>existences</i> is also through wisdom.'</p>  
 <p>51. And when, in that manner, he saw the great advantage and preciousness of wisdom, he became more thankful unto Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, the lord, and the archangels of <a name="fr_61"></a><a href="#fn_60"><font size="1">2</font></a> the spirit of wisdom; (52) and he took <a name="fr_62"></a><a href="#fn_61"><font size="1">3</font></a> the spirit of wisdom as a protection. 53. For the spirit of wisdom <i>one</i> is to perform more homage and service than <i>for</i> the remaining archangels. 54. And this, too, he knew, that it is possible to do for oneself every duty and good work and proper action through the power of wisdom; (55) and it is necessary to be diligent for the satisfaction of the spirit of wisdom. 56. And, thenceforward, he became more diligent in performing <a name="fr_63"></a><a href="#fn_62"><font size="1">4</font></a> the ceremonial of the spirit of wisdom.</p>  
 <p>57. After that the spirit of wisdom, on account of the thoughts and wishes of that sage, displayed <i>his</i> person unto him. 58. And he spoke to him (59) thus: 'O friend <i>and</i> glorifier! good from perfect righteousness! (60) seek advancement from me, the spirit of wisdom, (61) that I may become thy guide to the satisfaction of the sacred beings and</p>

 <p><a name="fn_32"></a><a href="sbe24007.htm#fr_33">3:1</a> This heading is prefixed to the original Pahlavi text in K43, a facsimile of which was published by Andreas in 1882; as, however, the text which follows it, in that codex, begins in the middle of Chap. I, 28, this heading must have been composed by some copyist, after the first folio of the text had been lost from some previous copy. It is, therefore, doubtful whether the name he gives to the work, 'Opinions (or decisions) of the Spirit of Wisdom,' be the original title, or not; but it is, at any rate, preferable to the modern appellation, 'the Spirit of Wisdom.' In Pâzand this title is Mainyô-i Khard; but regarding the Pahlavi word maînôg, see the Introduction.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_33"></a><a href="sbe24007.htm#fr_34">3:2</a> The beginning of this chapter, enclosed in brackets, as far as § 28 (being lost from the Pahlavi text of K43, and no copy of it from TD2 being available) is here taken from the Pâzand version contained in L19. The division into sections, adopted throughout, is that of the alternating Pâz.-Sans. text of Nêryôsang.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_34"></a><a href="sbe24007.htm#fr_35">4:1</a> That is, this work is a selection of wisdom from the religion. The Pâz. va<i>s</i> is a misreading of Pahl. a<i>g</i>a<i>s</i>, 'from it,' which is identical in form with Pahl. afa<i>s</i>, the correct equivalent of Pâz. va<i>s</i>.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_36"></a><a href="sbe24007.htm#fr_37">4:3</a> The angels are here compared to the vâspûharakân, the highest class of Sasanian nobles, called barbêtân, 'sons of the house,' in Huzvâri<i>s</i> (see Nŏldeke's Gesch. Pers. Sas. pp. 71, 501). As these nobles ranked next to the royal house, so do the archangels and angels rank next to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>. The title vâspûhar is evidently connected with the ancient Pers. equivalent of Av. vîsô puthra, 'son of the village or town,' which, as Darmesteter points out (Études Iraniennes, II, p. 140), is used in Vend. VII, 114 as the title of a person who has to pay the same medical fees as the za<i>n</i>tu-paiti, 'tribe-ruler,' mentioned in the earlier § 108, and who must, therefore, have been a man of equal rank.</p>

Zarathu<i>s</i>tra Spitama, the great apostle of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, whose conversations with Ahura Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a (Pahl. Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>) constitute a considerable portion of the Avesta, or scripture of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_39"></a><a href="sbe24007.htm#fr_40">5:1</a> Of the spheres, or firmaments, which are supposed to carry along the heavenly bodies.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_42"></a><a href="sbe24007.htm#fr_43">5:4</a> It may be questioned whether this allusion to a heterodox religion injuring the property of the orthodox faith is sufficient to identify the former with Muhammadanism.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_43"></a><a href="sbe24007.htm#fr_44">5:5</a> These two sections are improperly separated by Nêryôsang.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_44"></a><a href="sbe24007.htm#fr_45">6:1</a> The original text was, no doubt, vinâs pavan bûn va<i>l</i> yehevûnê<i>d</i>, which would be gunâh pa bun ô bahô<i>d</i> in Pâzand; but L19 has omitted the p in pa, and Nêr. has mistaken the preposition va<i>l</i> for the pronoun valman, which blunders have misled the writers of later MSS. into a variety of inconsistent readings.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_47"></a><a href="sbe24007.htm#fr_48">6:4</a> By this division of §§ 28-30 Nêr. found himself compelled to add another Sanskrit clause in explanation, which would have been unnecessary if he had separated them as here pointed.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_53"></a><a href="sbe24007.htm#fr_54">7:1</a> L19 has 'every one who,' having read ko<i>l</i>â mûn instead of ko<i>l</i>â maman. The meaning, however, is that all details of foreign faiths that are not found in the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping religion are doubtful.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_60"></a><a href="sbe24007.htm#fr_61">8:2</a> That is, 'produced by' this spirit, as mentioned in § 49 regarding the world, and here extended to the archangels.
