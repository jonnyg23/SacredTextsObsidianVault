 <p>1. The thirty-second subject is this, that, when a hen utters a crow in a house, or the cock crows. unseasonably, it is desirable that they do not kill it <a name="fr_1261"></a><a href="#fn_1251"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and do not consider <i>it</i> a bad habit (fahl). 2. Because it is uttering that crow <i>for</i> the reason that a fiend has found a way into that house, and the hen or the cock, <i>alone</i>, does not possess the power (<i>t</i>âqat) that <i>would</i> keep the fiend away from that house, and the hen is going to give the cock assistance, and utters the crow. 3.

 <p><i>may</i> drive away that fiend through the assistance of one another. 4. And if a cock crows unseasonably it is likewise not desirable to kill <i>it</i>, because the reason may be this which I have stated.</p>  
 <p>5. For it is declared in the good religion, that there is a fiend whom they call Sê<i>g</i> <a name="fr_1262"></a><a href="#fn_1252"><font size="1">1</font></a>, <i>and</i>, in every house <i>where</i> an infant exists, that <i>fiend</i> strives that she <i>may</i> cause some misfortune to come upon that house. 6. <i>So</i> it is necessary that they <i>should</i> keep a cock <i>on</i> the watch for her, so that it <i>may</i> smite that fiend and force <i>her</i> to the road <i>away</i> from that house.</p>
