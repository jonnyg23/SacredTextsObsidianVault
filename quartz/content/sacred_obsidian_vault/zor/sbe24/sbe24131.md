 <p>1. The forty-third subject is this, that it is necessary to make an endeavour to kill noxious creatures <i>and</i> reptiles (ha<i>s</i>arât) of the earth; because, in revelation <a name="fr_1322"></a><a href="#fn_1311"><font size="1">1</font></a>, it is put <i>forth as</i> a great good work.</p>  
 <p>2. Especially these five things:One is the frog in the water, the second is the snake and scorpion, the third is the ant (mar<i>k</i>is) <a name="fr_1323"></a><a href="#fn_1312"><font size="1">2</font></a> that flies, the fourth is the <i>common</i> ant (môr<i>k</i>ah), and the fifth is the mouse. 3. Therefore <a name="fr_1324"></a><a href="#fn_1313"><font size="1">3</font></a>, every time that they bring a frog up, out of the water, and make <i>it</i> dry, and, after (bahd) that, kill it, it is a good work of a thousand <i>and</i> two hundred dirhams <i>in</i> weight <a name="fr_1325"></a><a href="#fn_1314"><font size="1">4</font></a>. 4. And every time that they kill a snake, and recite the Avesta that is <i>appointed</i> for that <i>occasion</i> <a name="fr_1326"></a><a href="#fn_1315"><font size="1">5</font></a>, it is</p>  
 <p>

 <p>just as though they have slain an apostate (âshmô<i>gh</i>). 5. For every one who kills a <i>flying</i> ant (mar<i>k</i>is) it is as much good work as <i>for</i> any one who is reciting <i>inward</i> prayer <i>for</i> ten days. 6. Among the creatures of Aharman nothing whatever is more harmful than this; for, if it dies in the air (havâ) it becomes a gnat, if it dies in the dust it becomes a worm, if it dies in the water it becomes a leech <a name="fr_1327"></a><a href="#fn_1316"><font size="1">1</font></a>, if it dies among the excavators of flesh it becomes a venomous snake (mâr-i afhaî), and if it dies in dung it becomes creeping <i>things</i>. 7. <i>For</i> every one who kills a corn-dragging ant it is as much good work as <i>for</i> any one <i>who</i> recites the Hôrmazd Ya<i>s</i>t. 8. And <i>for</i> every one who kills many noxious creatures it is as much good work as <i>for</i> a priest who performs the ceremonial of the sacred beings; both good works are equal. 9. <i>For</i> every one who kills a mouse it is as much good work as <i>if</i> four lions are killed <a name="fr_1328"></a><a href="#fn_1317"><font size="1">2</font></a>. 10. Therefore, it is incumbent on every one to make an effort to kill a noxious creature.</p>
