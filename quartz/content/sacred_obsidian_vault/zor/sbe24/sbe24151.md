 <p>1. The sixty-third subject is this, that it is necessary to practise strict abstinence from adultery on this account, that <i>through</i> every one who beguiles the wife of another, and commits iniquity with her, that woman becomes, in a moment, unlawful as regards <i>her</i> husband. 2. And, after that, every time her husband comes round about her, it is just as though she had gone near to a strange man. 3. The righteous bestowal <a name="fr_1404"></a><a href="#fn_1393"><font size="1">4</font></a> <i>of herself</i> on her own husband, in this</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_325"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 325</font></a></p>  
 <p>situation, is always worse <i>than his going</i> <a name="fr_1405"></a><a href="#fn_1394"><font size="1">1</font></a> with women of a different religion, on this account, that, if that wife becomes pregnant, it is just as though one of the good religion had fallen <i>away</i> into a different religion, and <a name="fr_1406"></a><a href="#fn_1395"><font size="1">2</font></a> thereby that man becomes worthy of death.</p>  
 <p>4. And it also happens, when that wife becomes pregnant, <i>that</i> she <i>may</i> effect the slaughter of the infant, from fear of a bad reputation. 5. Then, <i>for</i> that person whose child it is, it is just as though he had effected the slaughter of the child with his own hand; therefore, he is worthy of death. 6. If the infant be born, and it remains <a name="fr_1407"></a><a href="#fn_1396"><font size="1">3</font></a> in the religion, every sin that that child of his commits is, for that person, just as though it were committed by his own hand.</p>  
 <p>7. And if a woman of those of the good religion commits <i>adultery</i>, she becomes in a condition unlawful as regards <i>her</i> husband; <i>and</i> if an infant be born it is illegitimate. 8. And the sin owing to this will depart <i>at</i> the time when that person goes near to her husband <i>and</i> shall say: 'What is <i>there</i> in me befitting thy wife? 9. A calamity (âk) <i>has</i> occurred, and a crime (<i>h</i>a<i>t</i>â) <i>has</i> come into <i>my</i> body; thou knowest if thou <i>wilt</i> exercise forgiveness (hafû), and if not, when <i>it is</i> not for me, do thou kill <i>me</i>; my blood is lawful (halâl) unto thee.' 10. If he shall kill her, her sin will depart owing to this;</p>

 <p>otherwise, this sin will not depart from her in any manner (navaî) <a name="fr_1408"></a><a href="#fn_1397"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>11. And <i>one</i> calls this sin a sin <i>affecting</i> antagonists <a name="fr_1409"></a><a href="#fn_1398"><font size="1">2</font></a>, <i>and</i>, so long as the antagonist does not become satisfied, the sin flows on <a name="fr_1410"></a><a href="#fn_1399"><font size="1">3</font></a>, <i>and</i> they keep his soul back at the head of the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge, till the time that its antagonist shall arrive and himself accomplishes <i>his</i> antagonism, and they give him back a reply <a name="fr_1411"></a><a href="#fn_1400"><font size="1">4</font></a>.</p>
