 <p>1. The sixty-sixth subject is this, that it is incumbent on all women <a name="fr_1430"></a><a href="#fn_1419"><font size="1">2</font></a> to order the days (ayyâm) of the Dvâzdah-hômâst <a name="fr_1431"></a><a href="#fn_1420"><font size="1">3</font></a>, because the whole of any sin that may have arisen during menstruation, and <i>at</i> other times, becomes cleared away <i>thereby</i>.</p>  
 <p>2. And in the commentary of the Vendîdâ<i>d</i> it says <i>that</i> every one becomes sanctified in the days of the Dvâzdah-hômâst, and all sins become cleared away from her, like that which <i>occurs at</i> harvest time, when a great wind comes on and carries it off; dust like this the sin departs from her, and the person becomes clean <i>and</i> pure.</p>  
 <p>3. And, for women <a name="fr_1432"></a><a href="#fn_1421"><font size="1">4</font></a>, there is no duty more indispensable than this; for it is declared in revelation that, when they celebrate a Dvâzdah-hômâst, it is a good work of a hundred thousand Tanâvars <a name="fr_1433"></a><a href="#fn_1422"><font size="1">5</font></a>, and if</p>

 <p>it be the days of the Dvâzdah-hômâst it is a good work of a thousand thousand Tanâvars, and when they celebrate <i>it</i> by day it is a good work just like this.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1420"></a><a href="sbe24154.htm#fr_1431">330:3</a> In the Gu<i>g</i>arâti version (p. 310) of the long-metre Sad Dar Dastûr Jâmâspji states, in a foot-note, that the Dvâzdah-hômâst consists of a Yazi<i>s</i>n ceremony every day for 144 days, in honour of twelve angels, so that each angel is reverenced for twelve successive days. He stated formerly (see Byt. II, 59 n) that this celebration was a Hômâst, and that a Dvâzdah-hômâst was a similar celebration for 264 days in honour of twenty-two angels for twelve days each. It appears, however, from Chap. XLI, 7, 20, that the number of ceremonies may vary with the wealth of the individual.</p>
