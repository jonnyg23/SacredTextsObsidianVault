 <p>1. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: 'Is a blind eye worse, or a blind mind (dîl)? 3. Is the ill-informed worse, or the bad-tempered?'</p>  
 <p>4. The spirit of wisdom answered (5) thus: 'He who is blind-eyed, when he has understanding in anything, <i>and</i> accomplishes learning, is to be considered as sound-eyed. 6. <i>And</i> he who is sound-eyed, when he has no knowledge <i>and</i> understanding <a name="fr_288"></a><a href="#fn_284"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and even that which they teach him he does not accept, then that is worse than even a blind eye.</p>  
 <p>7. 'The ill-tempered is less evil <a name="fr_289"></a><a href="#fn_285"><font size="1">2</font></a> than the ill-informed; (8) because the ill-tempered, except by a decree, is not able to seize anything away from any one; (9) and <i>as to</i> the ill-informed man, his desire of every kind is then <a name="fr_290"></a><a href="#fn_286"><font size="1">3</font></a> for oppression and plunder. 10. Concerning him who is ill-informed <i>it</i> is declared that, apart from predestination, he is born <i>free</i> from fresh understanding <a name="fr_291"></a><a href="#fn_287"><font size="1">4</font></a>'</p>
