 <p>1. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: 'How is it necessary to perform the ceremonial of the sacred beings and the thanksgiving for the welfare which is owing to the sacred beings? 3. <i>And</i> how is the renunciation <i>of sin</i> to be performed for the preservation of the soul?'</p>  
 <p>4. The spirit of wisdom answered (5) thus: 'That ceremonial of the sacred beings is good which they perform in this pure, good religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers. 6. Its origin, also, is goodness and truth, and freedom from doubt in the sacred beings. 7. And for the little and the much that has come <i>there has</i> arisen thanksgiving unto the sacred beings; and <i>one</i> is to meditate upon the gratifications (shnûmakân) and prosperity which are owing to the, sacred beings and to keep grateful <a name="fr_499"></a><a href="#fn_493"><font size="1">2</font></a>. 8. And even when perplexity and misery come on from Aharman and the demons, <i>he</i> is not to become doubtful as to the treasure of the sacred beings, (9) and not to diminish the thanksgiving unto the sacred beings. 10. And every disaster which springs up <i>he</i> is to give back <a name="fr_500"></a><a href="#fn_494"><font size="1">3</font></a> to the violence of Aharman and the demons. 11. <i>He</i> is not to seek his own welfare and advantage through the injury of any one else; (12) and he</p>

 <p>becomes compassionate as regards the creatures of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>. 13. In duty and good works <i>he</i> is diligent and striving <a name="fr_501"></a><a href="#fn_495"><font size="1">1</font></a>; (14) <i>and</i> especially in the care of water and fire <a name="fr_502"></a><a href="#fn_496"><font size="1">2</font></a> <i>he</i> is to persevere much. 15. And <i>he</i> is to be without doubt as to this, that, except happiness, the sacred beings do not then <a name="fr_503"></a><a href="#fn_497"><font size="1">3</font></a> give anything whatever, <i>as</i> a modification <a name="fr_504"></a><a href="#fn_498"><font size="1">4</font></a> of it, unto men; and Aharman and the demons, except misery, do not then <a name="fr_505"></a><a href="#fn_497"><font size="1">3</font></a> give them any happiness.</p>  
 <p>16. 'For the existence of renunciation <i>of sin</i> the special thing is this, that <i>one</i> commits no sin voluntarily; (17) and if, through folly, or weakness and ignorance, a sin occurs, he is then in renunciation <i>of sin</i> before the high-priests and the good. 18. And after that, <i>when</i> <a name="fr_506"></a><a href="#fn_499"><font size="1">5</font></a> he does not commit it, then that sin which is committed by him becomes thus a sweeping (êsvârakŏ) <a name="fr_507"></a><a href="#fn_500"><font size="1">6</font></a> from his body; (19) just as the wind which is hasty and mighty, when it comes swift and strong, sweeps so over the plain that it carries away every single blade of grass (gîyyâkî<i>k</i>akŏ-1) and anything which is broken <i>in</i> that place.'</p>
