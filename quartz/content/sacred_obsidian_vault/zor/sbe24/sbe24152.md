 <p>1. The sixty-fourth subject is this, that it is necessary to practise great abstinence from committing theft <a name="fr_1412"></a><a href="#fn_1401"><font size="1">5</font></a> and seizing anything from mankind by force.</p>  
 <p>2. For it is declared in revelation that, <i>as to</i> every one who steals one dirham <a name="fr_1413"></a><a href="#fn_1402"><font size="1">6</font></a> away from another, when they really know <i>it</i>, it is necessary to take two dirhams away from him; one dirham <i>being</i> that which <i>was</i> carried off, and one dirham as the fine of him who committed the theft. 3. It is also requisite to cut <i>off</i> one ear, and it is necessary to strike ten <i>blows with</i> a stick, and to detain <i>him</i> one period in prison.</p>

 <p>4. And if he shall steal another <a name="fr_1414"></a><a href="#fn_1403"><font size="1">1</font></a> dirham, in the same manner <i>one</i> is to take away two dirhams <a name="fr_1415"></a><a href="#fn_1404"><font size="1">2</font></a>, to cut <i>off</i> the other ear, to strike twenty <i>blows with</i> a stick, and to detain <i>him</i> two periods <a name="fr_1416"></a><a href="#fn_1405"><font size="1">3</font></a> in prison. 5. And if he shall steal three dirhams and two dângs <a name="fr_1417"></a><a href="#fn_1406"><font size="1">4</font></a>, it is requisite to cut <i>off his</i> right hand. 6. If he shall steal five hundred dirhams <a name="fr_1418"></a><a href="#fn_1407"><font size="1">5</font></a>, it is requisite to hang <i>him</i>.</p>  
 <p>7. <i>On</i> the spot the punishment is this, and among the spirits it brings punishment on the soul itself. 8. And, if the <i>other</i> person does not know <i>it</i>, they take away twice as much good work, among the spirits, from that <i>thief</i>, and give <i>it</i> to the soul of this person. 9. If <i>the thief</i> possesses no good works, they give the compensation from the constantly-beneficial treasury <a name="fr_1419"></a><a href="#fn_1408"><font size="1">6</font></a>, and exhibit the punishment on the soul of that <i>thief</i>.</p>  
 <p>10. <i>As to</i> that person who has seized anything</p>

 <p>from another by force, among the spirits they seize back four <i>things</i> <a name="fr_1420"></a><a href="#fn_1409"><font size="1">1</font></a> as compensation for every single one. 11. And if, <i>on</i> the spot <i>where people</i> capture him, he makes <i>it</i> convenient to return four <i>things</i> in compensation <i>for</i> one, when they have fully understood, as they capture that person who is committing highway-robbery, <i>that</i> he makes <i>it</i> convenient <a name="fr_1421"></a><a href="#fn_1410"><font size="1">2</font></a>, they <i>may</i> kill him at once.</p>

It is said to be situated in the 'endless light' of heaven, and is the misvânô gâtu<i>s</i> <i>h</i><i>v</i>adhâtô, 'ever-benefiting place, the self-sustained,' of Vend. XIX, 122. Perhaps gan<i>g</i>, 'treasury,' may have been originally gun<i>g</i>, 'space,' which would better suit the idea of a 'self-sustained place' (see Dd. XXVI, 3, XXXI, 24, XXXVII, 22, 24, XXXVIII, 3). The term 'treasurer,' applied to the female personifications of conscience who meet the soul with the stores of its good works and sins. (sec Sg. IV, 92-96), seems to have no connection with this treasury of other people's good works.</p>
