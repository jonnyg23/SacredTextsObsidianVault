 <p>I. The tenth subject is this, that it is incumbent on all those of the good religion, women and men, every one who attains to fifteen years, to wear the <i>sacred thread-</i>girdle <a name="fr_1149"></a><a href="#fn_1140"><font size="1">4</font></a>. 2. Because the <i>sacred thread-</i>girdle is to be a girding of the loins and to preserve obedience (<i>t</i>âhat) to the Lord, may he be honoured and glorified (hazza va <i>g</i>alla)!</p>  
 <p>3. The first person who set the wearing of this <i>sacred thread-</i>girdle in view was Jamshê<i>d</i> <a name="fr_1150"></a><a href="#fn_1141"><font size="1">5</font></a>. 4. And it may be the whole (<i>g</i>umlah) of the demons and fiends who are made extinct by the glory of wearing the <i>sacred thread-</i>girdle.</p>  
 <p>5. Every one who <i>has</i> tied the <i>sacred thread-</i>girdle round the waist is out of the department of Aharman, and is established in the department of</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Hôrmazd. 6. And also, while he keeps the <i>sacred thread-</i>girdle on the waist, <i>there</i> is a share <i>for</i> him of all those duties and good works which they perform in the earth of seven regions. 7. It is like that <i>which occurs</i> when they are performing hamâ zôr and hamâ ashô <a name="fr_1151"></a><a href="#fn_1142"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and have put <i>on</i> this <i>sacred thread-</i>girdle on that account, <i>or</i> when, similarly, some one in Ka<i>s</i>mîr, or <i>E</i>rân-ve<i>g</i>, or Kangdez, or the enclosure formed by Jam <a name="fr_1152"></a><a href="#fn_1143"><font size="1">2</font></a>, performs a good work, <i>and</i> we are not able to perform <i>it</i> with hamâ zôr, then they and we, <i>who</i> wear the <i>sacred thread-</i>girdle on the waist, are mutually connected and equally meritorious, one <i>with</i> the other. 8. As no good work attains to him <i>who</i> does not wear a <i>sacred thread-</i>girdleexcepting that which he performs himselfit is therefore necessary that any one of mankind <i>should</i> not put <i>it</i> <a name="fr_1153"></a><a href="#fn_1144"><font size="1">3</font></a> away from the waist on any occasion, so that the associated good works of those of the good religion <i>may</i> attain to him.</p>  
 <p>9. And those four knots <a name="fr_1154"></a><a href="#fn_1145"><font size="1">4</font></a>, <i>with</i> which they tie <i>it</i> on, are on this account, that it <i>may</i> give four attestations.</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> 10. The first knot is that which preserves <a name="fr_1155"></a><a href="#fn_1146"><font size="1">1</font></a> constancy (qarâr), and gives attestation as to the existence, unity, purity, and matchlessness of the sacred being, the good <i>and</i> propitious. 11. The second knot is that which gives attestation <i>that it is</i> the good religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers which is the word of the sacred being. 12. The third knot is that which gives attestation as to the apostleship and mission (rasûlî) in the just (haqq) Zaratu<i>s</i>t, the Spitamân. 13. The fourth knot is that which adduces more pleasantly, gives assurance (iqrâr), and openly accepts that I <i>should</i> think of good, speak of good, and do good. 14. And from the whole I become established; and the pure, good <a name="fr_1156"></a><a href="#fn_1147"><font size="1">2</font></a> religion is this, that I persist in those <i>views</i>.</p>  
 <p>15. And, again, when the archangels came meeting Zaratu<i>s</i>t they likewise wore the <i>sacred thread-</i>girdle on the waist; and the distinctive <i>characteristic</i> (farq) amid the laws of the sacred being is the wearing of the <i>sacred thread-</i>girdle. 16. It is incumbent both on woman and on man, <i>and</i> it is altogether (albattah) improper when they do not wear <i>it</i>.</p>
