 <p>1. The twenty-eighth subject is this, that, when they teach the Avesta, it is <i>in</i> like manner necessary</p>  
 <p><a name="page_291"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 291</font></a></p>  
 <p>that they teach <i>it</i> properly and truly, <i>and</i> recite <i>it</i> with deliberation and composure (sâkinî). 2. And it is necessary <i>for</i> those who are taught to recite <i>it</i> connectedly, and to keep <i>it</i> ever <i>in</i> remembrance.</p>  
 <p>3. For it is declared in revelation, that the sacred being <i>has</i> decreed thus: '<i>As to</i> every one who puts the Avesta away from <i>his</i> memory, I <i>will</i> put his soul as far from heaven as the width of the earth <a name="fr_1254"></a><a href="#fn_1244"><font size="1">1</font></a>.' 4. And in the commentary of the Avesta it is related <i>that</i>, in former times, <i>as to</i> any one who had been taught the Avesta and had put <i>it</i> away from <i>his</i> memory, until the time he had again made <i>it</i> easy, they would have given him bread like that which they give to the dogs. 5. <i>And in</i> another place I have read that they would have given bread to him <i>on</i> the point of a spear.</p>
