 <p>1. Again, about the delusion of Mânî, one out of the thousands <i>and</i> myriads is written; (2) for I am not unrestrained (anatang) as to writing more fully of the delusion, twaddle, and deceit of Mânî and the Mânîchaeans, (3) and much trouble and long-continued daily work is necessary for me therein.</p>  
 <p>4. Now you Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers of Zaratû<i>s</i>t should know that the original statement of Mânî <i>was</i> about the unlimitedness of the original evolutions, (5) the intermediate <i>one</i> about <i>their</i> mingling, (6) and the final <i>one</i> about the distinction of light from dark, (7) that which is much more like unto want of distinction <a name="fr_1056"></a><a href="#fn_1048"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>8. Again, <i>he states</i> this, that the worldly existence is a bodily formation of rudiments of Aharman; (9) the bodily formation <i>being</i> a production of Aharman. 10. And a repetition of that <i>statement</i> is this, that the sky is from the skin, (11) the earth from the flesh, (12) the mountains from the</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_244"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 244</font></a></p>  
 <p>bones, (13) and the trees from the hair of the demon Kunî <a name="fr_1057"></a><a href="#fn_1049"><font size="1">1</font></a>. 14. The rain is the seed of the Mâzendarâns <a name="fr_1058"></a><a href="#fn_1050"><font size="1">2</font></a> who are bound on the <i>celestial</i> sphere. 15. Mankind are two-legged demons, and animals four-legged. 16. And Kunî is the commander of the army of Aharman, (17) who, to be liberated by <a name="fr_1059"></a><a href="#fn_1051"><font size="1">3</font></a> his nails from the divinity Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> <i>in</i> the first conflict, swallowed the light; (18) and, in the second conflict, the demon Kunî <i>was</i> captured by them, <i>together</i> with many demons. 19. And it is <i>in</i> binding the demon Kunî on the <i>celestial</i> sphere <i>he</i> is killed, (20) <i>and</i> these magnificent creatures are preserved from him and formed.</p>  
 <p>21. And the sun <i>and</i> moon are arranged in supremacy <i>in</i> the outer sky; (22) so that, as regards that light which the demons swallowed, they filter and excite <a name="fr_1060"></a><a href="#fn_1052"><font size="1">4</font></a> <i>it</i>, little <i>by</i> little, through the exciting and filtering of the sun and moon. 23. Then Aharman knew, through foresight, that they <i>would</i> rapidly filter and release this light through the exciting of the sun and moon. 24. <i>And</i>, for the purpose of not rapidly releasing the light from the darkness, he prepared this lesser world which, like mankind, cattle, <i>and</i> the other living creatures, is a wholly-copied similitude of the greater world</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_245"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 245</font></a></p>  
 <p>with the other bodily creations <a name="fr_1061"></a><a href="#fn_1053"><font size="1">1</font></a>. 25. He confined life and light in the body, and made <i>them</i> prisoners; (26) so that, while that light which is excited by the sun and moon is again exhausted through the cohabitation and birth of living creatures, (27) <i>their</i> release would become more tardy.</p>  
 <p>28. And the rain was the seed of the Mâzendarâns (29) for the reason <i>that</i> when the Mâzendarâns are bound on the <i>celestial</i> sphere <a name="fr_1062"></a><a href="#fn_1054"><font size="1">2</font></a>, (30) whose light is swallowed by them, (31) and, in order to pass <i>it</i> from them through a new regulation, discrimination, and retention of the light of Time <a name="fr_1063"></a><a href="#fn_1055"><font size="1">3</font></a>, the twelve glorious <i>ones</i> <a name="fr_1064"></a><a href="#fn_1056"><font size="1">4</font></a> show the daughters of Time <i>to</i> the household-attending male Mâzendarâns, (32) so that while the lust of those Mâzendarâns, from seeing them, is well suited to them, (33) and seed is discharged from them, (34) the light which is within the seed is poured <i>on</i> to the earth. 35. Trees, shrubs, <i>and</i> grain have grown therefrom, (36) and the light which is within the Mâzendarâns is discharged in the seed. 37. That which is within the earth is discharged from the earth as the cause of the trees.</p>  
 <p>38. Again, about the difference of nature of life and body, this <i>is stated</i>, that the life is confined and imprisoned within the body. 39. <i>And</i> as the producer and maintainer of the bodily formations of all material existences is Aharman, (40) for the same reason it is not expedient to occasion birth <i>and</i> to propagate lineage(41) because it is co-operating</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_246"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 246</font></a></p>  
 <p>with Aharman in the maintenance of mankind and cattle, and <i>in</i> causing the exhaustion of the life and light within <i>their</i> bodiesnor yet to cultivate trees and grain.</p>  
 <p>42. Again, inconsistently, they also say this, (43) that the destroyer of the creatures is always Aharman; (44) <i>and</i>, for the same reason, it is not expedient to kill any creature whatever, (45) because it (killing) is the work of Aharman.</p>  
 <p>46. Again, <i>they say</i> this, that, as the world is maintained by Aharman, <i>and in</i> the end the sacred being is triumphant (47) through the departure of lives from bodies, (48) this worldly existence is dissipated in the end, (49) <i>and</i> is not arranged anew; (50) nor does <i>there</i> occur a restoration of the dead <i>and</i> a future existence.</p>  
 <p>51. Again, <i>they say</i> this, that those two original evolutions are perpetually remaining, <i>and</i> existed as contiguously as sun and shadow, (52) and no demarcation <a name="fr_1065"></a><a href="#fn_1057"><font size="1">1</font></a> and open space existed between them.</p>  
 <p>53. Now I speak first about the impossibility of the occurrence of any existing thing <i>that is</i> unlimited, (54) except only those which I call unlimited, <i>that is</i>, empty space and time. 55. Those, indeed, which are for existence within <i>themthat is</i> beings and things in locality and timeare seen <i>to be</i> limited.</p>  
 <p>56. This, too, <i>I say</i>, that, if unity and duality be spoken <i>of</i> about them, <i>it is</i> owing to this, because unity, except through the perpetual encompassing of something, does not then exist therein. 57. For the one is this, namely, not two; (58) <i>and</i> the two</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_247"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 247</font></a></p>  
 <p>are these, namely, the original <i>one and</i> the one that is the difference of <i>this</i> one from the other (59) which is not called two. 60. When the one is not understood, except through the whole compassing of unity, (61) and duality cannot occur, except through the separation of unit <i>from</i> unit, (62) the one is that one in the unity, and is steadfast in unity. 63. One and two are in the pedigree (tôkhmak) of quantity <i>and</i> numerousness; (64) and quantity, numerousness, aggregation, and separation, which, as I <i>have</i> said, cannot occur without limitation, (65) are clear even to medium understandings.</p>  
 <p>66. Again, <i>I say</i> this, the unlimited is that which is not compassed by the understanding. 67. When it is not possible to compass by any understanding, <i>it</i> is inevitable <i>that</i> it was not possible to compass in the understanding of the sacred being. 68. It is itself the peculiarity of the sacred being, <i>and</i> even that of the gloomy original evolution is not wholly compassed within the understanding. 69. To speak <i>of</i> him whose own peculiarity is not compassed within his own understanding <i>as</i> all-good and all-seeing is strange <a name="fr_1066"></a><a href="#fn_1058"><font size="1">1</font></a>, (70) because it describes a whole aggregate, (71) and an aggregate is called a whole on account of encompassment <i>on</i> all sides. 72. <i>But what is</i> encompassed <i>on</i> all sides is inevitably limitedness. 73. Is it fitting to account that <i>as</i> a sacred being when aware, from all its own encompassment, <i>that it</i> is limited? 74. <i>And</i> if unlimited <i>it</i> is unaware <i>of it</i>. 75. The first knowledge of a sage is owing to his well-arranging <a name="fr_1067"></a><a href="#fn_1059"><font size="1">2</font></a> comprehension of his own peculiarity,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_248"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 248</font></a></p>  
 <p>nature, and quantity; (76) <i>and</i> to speak <i>of him</i> who was unaware <i>of</i> all his own peculiarity, nature, and quantity, <i>and</i> yet wise about another nature and quantity, is strange <a name="fr_1068"></a><a href="#fn_1060"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>77. This, too, <i>I say</i>, that as the unlimited, on account of non-encompassment, is not compassed by the understanding, (78) that <i>implies</i> this, that all its peculiarity <i>may be</i> wise, or there <i>may</i> be <i>some</i> that is ignorant; all <i>may be</i> light, or there <i>may</i> be <i>some</i> that is dark; all <i>may be</i> alive, or there <i>may</i> be <i>some</i> that is dead; and <i>one</i> is unaware of it.</p>  
 <p>79. Again, <i>I say</i> this, that the light and the life which I obtain here are an allotment that exists owing to the selfsame Time <a name="fr_1069"></a><a href="#fn_1061"><font size="1">2</font></a>, or <i>they are</i> not. 80. If <i>they be</i> an allotment that exists owing to a peculiarity of Time, that <i>implies that men</i> should well recognise this, that anything owing to whose allotment it is possible to ordain them must be provided with allotments. 81. <i>As to what is</i> provided with allotments, except when united it is then not possible <i>even</i> for it, (82) and <i>as to what is</i> united, except through the uniter by whom that united <i>thing</i> is united it does not then determine it. 83. And when the allotment made is seen <i>to be</i> limited, the origin from which the allotment is <i>in</i> like manner made is doubtless a limited existence. 84. As regards that, since they say that all allotment of a result is a giver of evidence <i>as</i> to <i>its</i> origin, (85) that <i>implies</i>, when I obtain an allotment made <i>and</i> limited, <i>that</i> an origin even of that, except when made and united</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_249"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 249</font></a></p>  
 <p>from allotments <i>and</i> limited, is then not possible to exist.</p>  
 <p>86. This, too, <i>I say</i>, that the unlimited is not bestowed, (87) because an allotment is bestowed from an aggregate, (88) and aggregation is an evidence as to limitation, (89) as I <i>have</i> shown above <a name="fr_1070"></a><a href="#fn_1062"><font size="1">1</font></a>. 90. So that <i>as to</i> the existence <i>and</i> nature of the origin, except by the likeness and similitude of the result, I do not then attain to them. 91. Whatever is obtained in the result (92) is certain to exist <i>in</i> like manner in the origin. 93. That <i>implies</i> likewise from <i>this</i> explanation, when the formation and limitation are obtainable in the result, <i>that</i> the origin also, from which the result <i>arises</i>, is without doubt as to limitation.</p>  
 <p>94. Again, <i>I say</i> this, that the unlimited is that which <i>has</i> an undisturbed position and an unbounded <a name="fr_1071"></a><a href="#fn_1063"><font size="1">2</font></a> individuality, (95) and there is no other position <i>or</i> resting-place for it disturbed <i>apart</i> from it. 96. That <i>implies</i>, when two original evolutions are said <i>to be</i> unlimited and of unbounded (asâmân) individuality, <i>that</i> the skies <i>and</i> earths, the rudimentary bodily formations, growths, <i>and</i> lives, the luminaries, divinities, <i>and</i> archangels, <i>and</i> the many congregations (hambari<i>s</i>nân) whose different names are owing to the difference of each one <i>of those two</i> from the other, cannot be limited. 97. What produced all those within them, and where <i>is it</i>, (98) when the two original evolutions have been eternally <i>in</i> an undisturbed position? 99.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_250"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 250</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Unless that individuality of theirs, which is unlimited, <i>be</i> made limited, how is it possible <i>for</i> a place to exist for all these <i>things that</i> are <i>and</i> were <i>and will</i> be made? 100. If a nature that is always unlimited can become limited, that certainly <i>implies that</i> it could even become nothing; (101) <i>and</i> that which they say about the unchangeableness of a nature is strange <a name="fr_1072"></a><a href="#fn_1064"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>102. This, too, you should understand, that the unlimited becomes that which <i>has</i> disturbed it, which <i>was</i> not appointed by it <i>at</i> first; (103) nothing different from it can exist separate from it. 104. Apart from the boundary of unlimitedness it is not understood, (105) or, stupidly, <i>one</i> does not know that thing, that is, of what <i>it is</i> he always speaks and contends and bandies words about, <i>and</i> thereby deludes those with a trifle of the trifles of knowledge into <i>some</i> way <i>and</i> whither. 106. If he uncritically <a name="fr_1073"></a><a href="#fn_1065"><font size="1">2</font></a> says even this of it, that its individuality is unlimited, and its knowledge also, <i>being</i> unlimited, knows through unlimited knowledge that it is unlimited, (107) that is a strange <i>thing</i> which is twofold strange <a name="fr_1074"></a><a href="#fn_1066"><font size="1">3</font></a>. 108. One is this, that of knowledge, except about things acquired by knowledge and compassed within knowledge, (109) nothing whatever is understood until complete, except that which is wholly compassed within knowledge and acquired, (110) which knowledge of anything arises through entire understanding of the thing. 111. <i>And</i> entire</p>
