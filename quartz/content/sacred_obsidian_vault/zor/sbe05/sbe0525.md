 <p>1. On the nature of generation it says in revelation, that a woman when she comes out from menstruation, during ten days and nights, when they go near unto her, soon becomes pregnant. 2. When she is cleansed from her menstruation, <i>and</i> when the time for pregnancy has come, always when the seed of the man is the more powerful a son arises from it; when that of the woman is the more powerful, a daughter; when both seeds are equal, twins and triplets. 3. If the male seed comes the sooner, it adds to the female, and she becomes robust; if the female seed comes the sooner, it becomes blood, <i>and</i> the leanness of the female <i>arises</i> therefrom.</p>  
 <p>4. The female seed is cold and moist, and <i>its</i> flow is from the loins, and the colour is white, red, and yellow; and the male seed is hot and dry, <i>its</i> flow is from the brain of the head, <i>and</i> the colour is white and mud-coloured (ha<i>s</i>gûn). 5. All <a name="fr_305"></a><a href="#fn_304"><font size="1">1</font></a> the seed of the females <i>which</i> issues beforehand, takes a place within the womb, and the seed of the males will remain above it, <i>and</i> will fill the space of the womb; whatever refrains therefrom becomes blood again, enters into the veins of the females, <i>and</i> at the time any one is born it becomes milk and'</p>

 <p>nourishes him, as all milk arises from the seed of the males, <i>and</i> the blood is that of the females.</p>  
 <p>6. These four things, they say, are male, <i>and these</i> female: the sky, metal, wind, <i>and</i> fire are male, and are never otherwise; the water, earth, plants, <i>and</i> fish are female, <i>and</i> are never otherwise; the remaining creation consists of male and female.</p>  
 <p>7. As regards the fish <a name="fr_306"></a><a href="#fn_305"><font size="1">1</font></a> it says that, at the time of excitement, they go forwards and come back in the water, two <i>and</i> two, the length of a mile (hâsar), which is one-fourth of a league (parasang), in the running water; in that coming <i>and</i> going they then rub <i>their</i> bodies <i>together</i>, and a kind of sweat drops out betwixt them, and <i>both</i> become pregnant.</p>
