 <p>1. On the nature of mountains it says in revelation, that, at first, the mountains have grown forth in eighteen years; and Albûr<i>z</i> ever grew, till the completion of eight hundred years; two hundred years <i>up</i> to the star station (pâyak), two hundred years to the moon station, two hundred years to the sun station, and two hundred years to the endless light <a name="fr_159"></a><a href="#fn_159"><font size="1">1</font></a>. 2. While the other mountains have grown out of Albûr<i>z</i>, in number 2244 mountains, <i>and</i> are Hûgar the lofty <a name="fr_160"></a><a href="#fn_160"><font size="1">2</font></a>, Têrak of Albûr<i>z</i>, <i>K</i>akâ<i>d</i>-i-Dâîtîk, and the Are<i>z</i>ûr ridge, the Aûsîndôm mountain, Mount Apârsên which they say is the mountain of Pârs, Mount Zari<i>d</i> also which is Mount Mânû<i>s</i>, Mount Aîra<i>k</i>, Mount Kaf, Mount Vâ<i>d</i>gês, Mount Aûshdâ<i>s</i>târ, Mount Are<i>z</i>ûr-bûm, Mount Rôyi<i>s</i>n-hômand, Mount Padashkhvârgar which is the greatest in Khvârîh, the mountain which they call <i>K</i>înŏ, Mount Rêvand, Mount Dârspêt the Bakyir mountain, Mount Kabed-<i>s</i>ikaft, Mount Sîyâk-mûî-mand, Mount Vafar-hômand, Mount Spendyâ<i>d</i> <i>and</i> Kôndrâsp, Mount Asnavand <i>and</i> Kôndras, Mount</p>

The Dimâvand <a name="fr_201"></a><a href="#fn_200"><font size="1">3</font></a> mountain is that in which Bêvarâsp is bound. 32.

The Ganâva<i>d</i> <a name="fr_204"></a><a href="#fn_203"><font size="1">1</font></a> mountain is likewise there, on the Ridge of Vi<i>s</i>tâsp (pû<i>s</i>t-i Vi<i>s</i>tâspân) <a name="fr_205"></a><a href="#fn_204"><font size="1">2</font></a> at the abode of the Bûr<i>z</i>în-Mitrô fire, nine leagues (parasang) to the west. 35.

Mount Asparô<i>g</i> <a name="fr_207"></a><a href="#fn_206"><font size="1">4</font></a> is established from the country of Lake <i>K</i>ê<i>k</i>ast <a name="fr_208"></a><a href="#fn_207"><font size="1">5</font></a> unto Pârs. 37.

 <p><a name="fn_159"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_159">34:1</a> These are the four grades of the Mazdayasnian heaven.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_160"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_160">34:2</a> In all the geographical details, mentioned in the Bundahi<i>s</i>, there is a strange mixture of mythical tradition with actual fact. The author of the work finds names mentioned in the Avesta, by old writers of another country, and endeavours to identify them with places known to himself; much in the same way as attempts have been made to identify the geographical details of the garden of Eden. Most of the names of these mountains occur in the Zamyâd Ya<i>s</i>t, or in other parts of the Avesta, as will be noticed in detail further on. The number 2244 is also mentioned in § 7 of that Ya<i>s</i>t. A very able commentary on this chapter will be found in Windischmann's Zoroastriche Studien, pp. 1-19.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_161"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_161">35:1</a> The Av. Si<i>k</i>idava of Zamyâd Yt. 5.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_162"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_162">35:2</a> See Chap. XXIX, 4, 10; the name is here written Kande<i>z</i> in R20. In M6 the word is kôf, 'mountain,' which is almost identical in form; if this be the correct reading, the translation will be, 'a mountain among those in the mountain which they say is agreeable and the delight,' &amp;c. This mountain is, however, probably intended for the Av. A<i>n</i>tare-kangha, 'within Kangha,' of Zamyâd Yt. 4.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_163"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_163">35:3</a> The Haraiti-bare<i>s</i> of Zamyâd Yt. 1; but it is more usually called Hara berezaiti (see Chap. V, 3).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_164"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_164">35:4</a> A central peak of the mythic Albûr<i>z</i>, around which the heavenly bodies are said to revolve (see Chap. V, 3). It is the Av. Taêra, mentioned in Yas. XLI, 24, Râm Yt. 7, Zamyâd Vt. 6.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_165"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_165">35:5</a> So in M6, but K20 has 'go in.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_166"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_166">35:6</a> This appears to be another peak of the mythic Albûr<i>z</i>, probably in the west, as it is connected with Satavês, the western chieftain of the constellations (see Chaps. XXIV, 17 and II, 7), It is the Av. Hukairya berezô, of Yas. LXIV, 14, Âbân Yt. 3, 25, 96, Gô<i>s</i> Yt. 8 Mihir Yt. 88, Rashnu Yt. 24, Fravardîn Yt. 6, Râm Yt. 15.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_167"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_167">35:7</a> See Chap. XIII, 3-5.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_168"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_168">35:8</a> In Aûharmazd Yt. 31 and Zamyâd Yt. 2, 66, an Ushidhâo mountain is mentioned as having many mountain waters around it, but this seems to be a near neighbour of the Ushidarena mountain (see § 15). The details in the text correspond with the description of the Hindva mountain, given in Tî<i>s</i>tar Yt. 32, thus: us Hindva<i>d</i> paiti garôi<i>d</i> yô hi<i>s</i>taiti maidhîm zrayanghô vouru-kashahê, 'up on the Hindva mountain, which stands amid the wide-shored <a name="page_36"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 36</font></a> ocean;' and the Pahlavi name, Aûsîndôm, has probably arisen from the us Hindva<i>d</i> of this passage, as suggested by Justi. (See Chaps. XIII, 5, and XVIII, 10, 11.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_169"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_169">36:1</a> The sky is considered to be a true firmament, or hard and indestructible dome.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_170"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_170">36:2</a> The <i>K</i>invatô-peretu of the Avesta, mentioned even in the Gâthas. In the Pahlavi Vend. XIX, 101, it is stated that 'they pass across by the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge, whose two extremities are their own heavenly angels, one stands at <i>K</i>akâ<i>d</i>-i-Dâîtîk, and one at Albûr<i>z</i>;' the former mountain seems not to be mentioned in the Avesta, but the bridge is the path of the soul to the other world if righteous the soul passes by it easily over Albûr<i>z</i> (the confines of this world) into paradise, but if wicked it drops off the bridge into hell.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_171"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_171">36:3</a> See Vend III, 23, XIX, 140. The words in brackets may perhaps be inserted by mistake, but they occur in all MSS. examined, and there is nothing inconsistent with tradition in supposing Are<i>z</i>ûr to be the extreme northern range of the mythic Albûr<i>z</i> which surrounds the earth, being the place where demons chiefly congregate.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_172"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_172">36:4</a> Justi adopts the reading Harpârsên, which occurs in K20 four times out of eleven, but is corrected thrice. Windischmann suggests that this mountain is the Av. <i>s</i>kyata (or i<i>s</i>katâ) upairi-saêna of Yas. X, 29, and Zamyâd Yt. 3, which the Pahlavi translator of the Yasna explains as 'the Pârsên crag.' It seems to be a general name for the principal mountain ranges in the south and east of Iran, as maybe seen on comparing this passage and Chap. XXIV, 28, <a name="page_37"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 37</font></a> with Chap. XX, 16, 17, 21, 22, where the Haro, Hêtûmand, Marv, and Balkh rivers are said to spring from Mount Apârsên; but its application to the southern range is perhaps due to the etymological attempt, in the text, to connect it with Pârs. The Selections of Zâ<i>d</i>-sparam, VII, 7, have <i>K</i>înîstân for Khû<i>g</i>îstân.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_173"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_173">37:1</a> This name can also be read Sîstân.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_174"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_174">37:2</a> In § 2 it is also called Zari<i>d</i>, but in Zamyâd Yt. 1 Zeredhô and Aredhô-manusha are mentioned as neighbouring mountains. The word 'great' is omitted in M6.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_175"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_175">37:3</a> That is, around the ranges of Albûr<i>z</i>, Apârsên, and Mânû<i>s</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_176"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_176">37:4</a> Perhaps intended for the Erezishô of Zamyâd Yt. 2. The description would apply to any of the mountains near Nî<i>s</i>âpûr.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_177"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_177">37:5</a> This name is omitted in the MSS., but is taken from § 2 as suggested by Justi. Perhaps it maybe connected with 'the country of Sênî' (Chap. XV, 29), which is explained as being <i>K</i>înîstân, probably the land of Samarkand, which place was formerly called <i>K</i>în, according to a passage in some MSS. of Tabari's Chronicle, quoted in Ouseley's Oriental Geography, p. 298.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_178"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_178">37:6</a> Not Kâf, nor is it mentioned in the Pahlavi Vend. V, 57, as supposed by Justi; the kâf kôp ârâya<i>d</i> of Spiegel's edition of the Pahlavi text being a misprint for kâfakŏ pârâya<i>d</i>, 'it traverses a fissure' (see Haug's Essays. 2nd ed. p. 326, note 2).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_180"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_180">38:2</a> Called Are<i>z</i>ûr-bûm in § 2, which name stands for the sixth and seventh mountains, Erezurô and Bumyô, in Zamyâd Yt. 2. The land of Arûm was the eastern empire of the Romans.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_181"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_181">38:3</a> Evidently the mountain range south of the Caspian, now called Albûr<i>z</i>; but whether this actual Albûr<i>z</i> is to be considered a part of the mythic Albûr<i>z</i> is not very clear.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_183"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_183">38:5</a> Or, 'the east.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_184"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_184">38:6</a> See Chap. XVII, 8.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_185"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_185">38:7</a> The Av. Vâiti-gaêsô, the twelfth mountain in Zamyâd. Yt. 2; Bâdghês in Persian.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_186"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_186">38:8</a> In § 2 it is Bakyir, which Justi thinks is another name for Mount Dârspêt ('white poplar'); the latter name not being repeated here makes this supposition probable.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_187"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_187">38:9</a> K20 has rûm and M6 has lanman, but both explained by the Pâz. gloss Yim, which is also the reading of the Pâz. MSS. If the gloss be rejected the most probable translation would be, 'and in our days Shatrô-râm (or râmi<i>s</i>n), the victorious, erected on it a myriad towns and cities.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_188"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_188">38:10</a> Windischmann suggests that this may he intended for the Av. <i>s</i>kyata or i<i>s</i>katâ mentioned in the note on Apârsên in § 9.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_189"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_189">39:1</a> The Av. Syâmaka and Vafray<i>a</i>u of Zamyâd Yt. 5; and probably the Siyâh-kôh and Safêd-kôh of Afghânistân. With regard to <i>K</i>înŏ, see the note on § 13. The former mountain is called Sîyâk-mûî-mand, 'having black hair,' in § 2, which is certainly a more grammatical form than Sîyâk-hômand.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_190"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_190">39:2</a> The Av. Spe<i>n</i>tô-dâta of Zamyâd Yt. 6.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_191"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_191">39:3</a> The term var often means 'lake,' but we are not informed of any Lake Rêvand, though a mountain of that name is described in § 18; so it seems advisable to take var here in its wider sense of 'enclosure, circuit, district.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_192"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_192">39:4</a> The Av. Kadrva-aspa of Zamyâd Yt. 6.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_193"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_193">39:5</a> See Chap. XXII, 3. All MSS. have Sôbar here.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_194"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_195">39:6</a> If the circumflex be used in Pahlavi to indicate not only the consonant d, but also the vowel î, ê when it follows a vowel, as seems probable, this name can be read Kôîrâs; in any case, it is evidently intended for the Av. Kaoirisa in Zamyâd Yt. 6. It is written Kôndras in § 2.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_195"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_196">39:7</a> The Av. Asnav<i>a</i>u of Zamyâd Yt. 5, Âtash Nyây. 5, Sîrôz. 9. See also Chap. XVII, 7.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_196"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_197">39:8</a> The Av. Raoidhitô, the eighth mountain of Zamyâd Yt. 2.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_197"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_198">39:9</a> So in M6 and the Pâz. MSS., but K20 has, 'The country mountains.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_198"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_199">40:1</a> This list is evidently intended to include the chief mountains known to the author of the Bundahi<i>s</i>, which he could not identify with any of those mentioned in the Avesta.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_199"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_200">40:2</a> This is the Pâzand reading of the name, on which very little reliance can be placed; the Pahlavi can also be read Dâna<i>d</i>, and it may be the Deana mountain, 12,000 feet high, near Ka<i>s</i>ki-zard.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_200"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_201">40:3</a> See Chap. XXIX, 9. This volcanic mountain, about 20,000 feet high and near Teheran, still retains this ancient Persian name, meaning 'wintry.' It is the chief mountain of the Padashkhvârgar range, which the Bundahi<i>s</i> evidently considers as an offshoot of the Apârsên ranges.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_201"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_202">40:4</a> The present name of a mountain between Nî<i>s</i>âpûr and the desert.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_202"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_203">40:5</a> The name of a place about midway between Astarâbâd and Nî<i>s</i>âpûr. This mountain is called Mî<i>g</i>în in § 29, probably from a place called Mezinan in the same neighbourhood.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_203"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_204">41:1</a> The Pers. Kanâbad, or Gunâbad, is near <i>G</i>umin.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_204"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_205">41:2</a> Another name for Mount Rêvand (§ 18). See Chap. XVII, 8.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_205"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_206">41:3</a> Probably in Kirmân.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_206"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_207">41:4</a> The mountain ranges of western Persia, including the Mount Zagros of classical writers.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_207"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_208">41:5</a> See Chap. XXII, 2.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_208"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_209">41:6</a> Probably the Merkhinah range in northern Lâristân.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_209"></a><a href="sbe0521.htm#fr_210">41:7</a> The Bakhtiyârî range in the province of Ispahân.</p>
