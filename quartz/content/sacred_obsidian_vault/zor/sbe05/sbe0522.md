 <p>1. On the nature of seas it says in revelation, that the wide-formed ocean keeps one-third of this earth on the south side of the border of Albûr<i>z</i> <a name="fr_211"></a><a href="#fn_210"><font size="1">8</font></a>, <i>and</i> so</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_42"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 42</font></a></p>  
 <p>wide-formed is the ocean that the water of a thousand lakes is held by it, such as the source Arêdvîvsûr <a name="fr_212"></a><a href="#fn_211"><font size="1">1</font></a>, <i>which</i> some say is the fountain lake. 2. Every particular lake is of a particular kind <a name="fr_213"></a><a href="#fn_212"><font size="1">2</font></a>, some are great, and some are small; some are so large that a man with a horse might compass <i>them</i> around in forty days <a name="fr_214"></a><a href="#fn_213"><font size="1">3</font></a>, which is 1700 leagues (parasang) in extent.</p>  
 <p>3. Through the warmth and clearness of the water, purifying more than other waters, everything continually flows from the source Arêdvîvsûr. 4. At the south of Mount Albûr<i>z</i> a hundred thousand golden channels are there formed, <i>and</i> that water goes with warmth and clearness, through the channels, on to Hûgar the lofty <a name="fr_215"></a><a href="#fn_214"><font size="1">4</font></a>; on the summit of that mountain is a lake <a name="fr_216"></a><a href="#fn_215"><font size="1">5</font></a>; into that lake it flows, becomes quite purified, and comes back through a different golden channel. 5. At the height of a thousand men an open golden branch from that channel is connected with Mount Aûsîndôm <a name="fr_217"></a><a href="#fn_216"><font size="1">6</font></a>, amid the wide-formed ocean; from there one portion flows forth to the ocean for the purification of the sea, <i>and</i> one portion drizzles in moisture upon the whole of this earth, and all the creations of Aûharmazd acquire</p>

 <p>health from it, and it dispels the dryness of the atmosphere.</p>  
 <p>6. Of the salt seas three are principal, <i>and</i> twenty-three are small. 7. Of the three which are principal, one is the Pûtîk, one the Kamrû<i>d</i>, and one the <i>S</i>ahî-bûn. 8. of all three the Pûtîk <a name="fr_218"></a><a href="#fn_217"><font size="1">1</font></a> is the largest, in which is a flow <i>and</i> ebb, on the same side as the wide-formed ocean, <i>and</i> it is joined to the wide-formed ocean. 9. Amid this wide-formed ocean, on the Pûtîk side, it has a sea which they call the Gulf (var) of Satavês <a name="fr_219"></a><a href="#fn_218"><font size="1">2</font></a>. 10. Thick and salt the stench <a name="fr_220"></a><a href="#fn_219"><font size="1">3</font></a> wishes to go from the sea Pûtîk to the wide-formed ocean; with a mighty high wind therefrom, the Gulf of Satavês drives away whatever is stench, <i>and</i> whatever is pure and clean goes into the wide-formed <i>ocean</i> and the source Arêdvîvsûr; <i>and</i> that flows back a second <i>time</i> to Pûtîk <a name="fr_221"></a><a href="#fn_220"><font size="1">4</font></a>. 11. The control <a name="fr_222"></a><a href="#fn_221"><font size="1">5</font></a> of this sea (the Pûtîk) is connected with the</p>

 <p>moon and wind; it comes again <i>and</i> goes down, in increase and decrease, because of her revolving. 12. The control <a name="fr_223"></a><a href="#fn_222"><font size="1">1</font></a> also of the Gulf of Satavês is attached to the constellation Satavês, in whose protection are the seas of the southern quarter, just as <i>those</i> on the northern side are in the protection of Haptôk-ring <a name="fr_224"></a><a href="#fn_223"><font size="1">2</font></a>. 13. Concerning the flow <i>and</i> ebb it is said, that everywhere from the presence of the moon two winds continually blow, whose abode is in the Gulf of Satavês, one they call the down-draught, and one the up-draught; when the up-draught blows <i>it is</i> the flow, and when the down-draught blows it is the ebb <a name="fr_225"></a><a href="#fn_224"><font size="1">3</font></a>. 14. In the other seas there is nothing of the nature of a revolution of the moon therein, <i>and</i> there are no flow <i>and</i> ebb. 15. The sea of Kamrû<i>d</i> <a name="fr_226"></a><a href="#fn_225"><font size="1">4</font></a> is that which they pass by, in the north, in Taparîstân; that of <i>S</i>ahî-bûn <a name="fr_227"></a><a href="#fn_226"><font size="1">5</font></a> is in Arûm.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_212"></a><a href="sbe0522.htm#fr_213">42:2</a> Literally, 'for every single lake <i>there is</i> a single kind;' but we may perhaps read lâ, 'not,' instead of the very similar râî, 'for,' and translate as follows: 'every single lake is not of one kind;' which expresses very nearly the same meaning.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_218"></a><a href="sbe0522.htm#fr_219">43:2</a> So called from the constellation Satavês (§ 12), see Chap. 11, 7. The details given in the text are applicable to the Gulf and Sea of Umân, the Arabian Sea of Europeans. The description of this Gulf, given in the Pahl. Vend. V, 57, which is rather obscure, is as follows: 'In purification <i>the impurities</i> flow, in the purity of water, from the sea Pûtîk into the wide-formed ocean; at the southernmost side <i>the water</i> stands back in mist, and the blue body of Satavês stands back around it. Pûtîk stands <i>out</i> from the side of Satavês, this is where <i>it is</i>. From which side it stands is not clear to me. The water comes to Satavês through the bottom; some say that it traverses a fissure.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_219"></a><a href="sbe0522.htm#fr_220">43:3</a> Perhaps a better reading would be stûrg sûr-i gôndakîh, 'the intense saltness which is stench.' The author appears to have had some vague idea of the monsoon.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_220"></a><a href="sbe0522.htm#fr_221">43:4</a> Or, perhaps, 'the other (the stench) flows back to Pûtîk.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_224"></a><a href="sbe0522.htm#fr_225">44:3</a> This is not a confused attempt to explain the tides as the effect of the land and sea breezes, as might be suspected at first, but is a reasonable conclusion from imaginary facts. Assuming that the wind always blows eastward and westward from the moon, it follows that as the moon rises an easterly wind must blow, which may be supposed to drive the flood tide westward into the Persian Gulf; until the moon passes the meridian, when the wind, changing to the west, ought to drive the ebb tide eastward out of the Gulf thus accounting for one flow and ebb every day, dependent on the position of the moon.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_225"></a><a href="sbe0522.htm#fr_226">44:4</a> Evidently the Caspian, which lies north of Taparîstân, a province including part of Mâzendarân.</p>

In the Selections of Zâ<i>d</i>-sparam, VI, 14, it is called Gêhân-bûn.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_229"></a><a href="sbe0522.htm#fr_230">45:3</a> The MSS. here add the first sentence of Chap. XX, and there is every reason to believe that Chaps. XX-XXII originally occupied this position, between XIII and XIV, (see the list of the contents of TD in the Introduction.).</p>
