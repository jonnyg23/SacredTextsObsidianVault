 <p><a name="fn_1220"></a><a href="sbe0561.htm#fr_1227">239:2</a> Referring to Vend. IV, 54-114, where seven classes of assault and their respective punishments are detailed. In our text eight classes of sin are named, although only seven degrees are mentioned; the second and third classes being apparently arranged together, as one degree of sin in § 2. Or the inconsistency may have arisen from the addition of the Farmân, a class of sin or crime not mentioned in the Vendidad, unless, indeed, it be the farmân spôkhtanŏ, 'neglect of commandment' (referring probably to priest's commands), of Pahl. Vend. VI, 15. The other seven classes are thus described in Pahl. Vend. IV, 54-57, 79, 85, 93, 99, 106:</p>  
 <p>'By the man whose weapon (or blow) is upraised for striking a man, that which is his Âgerept is thus implanted in <i>him</i>. When it <i>has</i> moved forwardthat is, he makes <i>it</i> advance<i>it</i> is thus his Avôirî<i>s</i>t, that is, Avôirî<i>s</i>t is implanted in him <i>and</i> the Âgerept merges into it, some say that it does not exist. When he comes on to him <i>with</i> thoughts of malicethat is, he places a hand upon him<i>it</i> is thus his Aredû<i>s</i>, that is, Aredû<i>s</i> is implanted in him and the Avôirî<i>s</i>t merges into it, some say that it does not exist. <i>At</i> the fifth Aredû<i>s</i> the man even becomes a Tanâpûhar; <i>things</i> at <a name="page_240"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 240</font></a> sunrise (a<i>v</i>ar-khûrshê<i>d</i>îh) and in the forenoon (<i>k</i>âîtîh = <i>k</i>âstîh) are no more apart. . . . Whoever inflicts the Aredû<i>s</i> blow on a man <i>it is</i> one-fifth of a wound (rêsh). . . . Whoever inflicts that which is a cruel Khôr ('hurt') on a man <i>it is</i> one-fourth of a wound. . . . Whoever inflicts that which is a bleeding Khôr on a man <i>it is</i> one-third of a wound. . . . Whoever shall give a man a bone-breaking Khôr <i>it is</i> half a wound.... Whoever strikes a man the blow <i>which puts him</i> out of consciousness shall give a whole wound.'</p>  
 <p>This description does not mention Bâ<i>z</i>âî and Yât, unless they be the two severer kinds of Khôr; but, Bâ<i>z</i>âî occurs in Pahl. Vend. IV, 115, V, 107, XIII, 38, though Yât seems not to be mentioned in the Vendidad. Aredû<i>s</i> occurs again in Pahl. Vend. III, 151, and Khôr in Pahl. Vend. III, 48, XIII, 38, and Yas. LVI, iv, 2.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1221"></a><a href="sbe0561.htm#fr_1228">240:1</a> Also written a<i>v</i>ôîri<i>s</i>t, avîri<i>s</i>t, aîvîri<i>s</i>t, avôkîri<i>s</i>t, and avakôri<i>s</i>t in other places.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1222"></a><a href="sbe0561.htm#fr_1229">240:2</a> Five of these names are merely slight alterations of the Av. âgerepta, avaoiri<i>s</i>ta, aredu<i>s</i>, <i>h</i><i>v</i>ara, and tanuperetha (peretôtanu or peshôtanu). The last seven degrees are also noticed in a very obscure passage in Farh. Okh. pp. 36, 37 (correcting the text from the old MSS. M6 and K20) as follows:</p>  
 <p>'Âgerept, "seized," is that when they shall take up a weapon for smiting an innocent <i>person</i>; Avôirî<i>s</i>t, "turning," is that when <i>one</i> turns the weapon upon an innocent <i>person</i>; when through sinfulness <i>one</i> lays the weapon on a sinner the name is Aredû<i>s</i>; for whatever reaches the source of life the name is Khôr; <i>one</i> explains Bâ<i>z</i>âî <i>as</i> "smiting," <i>and</i> Yât <i>as</i> "going to," <i>and</i> the soul of man ought to be withstanding, <i>as</i> a counterstroke is the penalty for a Yât when it <i>has</i> been so much <i>away</i> from the abode of life. <i>In</i> like manner Âgerept, Avôirî<i>s</i>t, Aredû<i>s</i>, Khôr, Bâ<i>z</i>âî, and Yât are also called good works, <i>which</i> are performed in like proportions, <i>and</i> are called by the names of weights and measures <i>in</i> the same manner. Of peshôtanu<i>s</i> tanûm pairyêitê the meaning is a Tanâpûhar; as they call a good work of three hundred a Tanâpûhar, on account of the three hundred like proportions of the same kind, the meaning of its name, Tanâpûhar, thereupon enters into sin. . . . A Khôr is just that description of wound from which <a name="page_241"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 241</font></a> the blood comes, irrespective of where, how, how much, <i>and</i> wherewith it is inflicted; <i>it is</i> that which is a wound from the beginning, <i>and</i> that which will result therefrom.'</p>  
 <p>The application of this scale of offences is, however, not confined to these particular forms of assault, but has been extended (since the Avesta was compiled) to all classes of sins, and also to the good works which are supposed to counterbalance them.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1223"></a><a href="sbe0561.htm#fr_1230">241:1</a> The dirham has been variously estimated, at different times, as a weight of forty-five to sixty-seven grains, but perhaps fifty grains may be taken as the meaning of the text, and the stîr may, therefore, be estimated at 200 grains. The Greeks used both these weights, which they called δραχμή and στατήρ.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1224"></a><a href="sbe0561.htm#fr_1231">241:2</a> The amounts of these first three degrees of sin are differently stated in other places (see Chaps. XI, 2, XVI, 1-3, 5). It is difficult to understand why the amounts of Âgerept and Avôirî<i>s</i>t should here be stated as less than that of Farmân, and some Parsis, therefore, read vîhast (as an irregular form of vîst, 'twenty') instead of vê<i>s</i>-ast, 'is most,' so that they may translate the amount as 'twenty dirhams;' but to obtain this result they would have to make further alterations in the Pahlavi text. In a passage quoted by Spiegel (in his Traditionelle Literatur der Parsen, p. 88) from the Rivâyat MS. P12, in the Bibliothèque Nationale at Paris, it is stated that Farmân is seven stîrs, Âgerept twelve stîrs, and Avôirî<i>s</i>t fifteen stîrs. Another Rivâyat makes the Farmân eight stîrs.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1225"></a><a href="sbe0561.htm#fr_1232">241:3</a> All MSS. have Aredû<i>s</i> sî 30, 'an Aredû<i>s</i> is thirty (30),' leaving it doubtful whether dirhams or stîrs are meant; and the same mode of writing is adopted in Chap. XI, 2.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1226"></a><a href="sbe0561.htm#fr_1233">241:4</a> All authorities agree about the amounts of the last five degrees of sin. These amounts are the supposed weights of the several sins in the golden scales of the angel Rashnû (see AV. V, 5), when the soul is called to account, for its actions during life, after the <a name="page_242"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 242</font></a> third night after death (see Mkh. II, 114-122). Its sins are supposed to be then weighed against its good works, which are estimated by the same scale of degrees (see the passage already quoted from Farh. Okh. in p. 240, note 2), and it is sent direct to heaven, or hell, or an intermediate place, according as the good works or sins preponderate, or are both equal. In the Avesta of the Vendidad, however, whence these degrees are derived, we find them forming merely a graduated scale of assaults, extending from first lifting the hand to smite even unto manslaughter; and for each of these seven degrees of assault a scale of temporal punishments is prescribed, according to the number of times the offence has been committed. These punishments consist of a uniform series of lashes with a horse-whip or scourge, extending from a minimum of five lashes to a maximum of two hundred (see Vend. IV, 58-114); each degree of assault commencing at a different point on the scale of punishments for the first offence, and gradually rising through the scale with each repetition of the offence, so that the more aggravated assaults attain the maximum punishment by means of a smaller number of repetitions. Thus, the punishments prescribed for Âgerepta, from the first to the eighth offence, are 5, 10, 15, 30, 50, 70, 90, and 200 lashes respectively; those for Avaoiri<i>s</i>ta, from the first to the seventh offence, extend on the same scale from 10 to 200 lashes; those for Aredu<i>s</i>, from the first to the sixth offence, are from 15 to 200 lashes; those for a bruised hurt (<i>h</i><i>v</i>ara), from the first to the fifth offence, are from 30 to 200 lashes; those for a bleeding hurt, from the first to the fourth offence, are from 50 to 200 lashes; those for a bone-breaking hurt, from the first to the third offence, are from 70 to 200 lashes; and those for a hurt depriving of consciousness or life, for the first and second offences, are 90 and 200 lashes. The maximum punishment of 200 lashes is prescribed only when the previous offences have not been atoned for, and it is to be inflicted in all such cases, however few or trifling the previous assaults have been.</p>

I, 47, III, 65, IV, 53, XXII, 33, Fravardîn Yt. 0, 90, 156, Âf. Rapithwin, 2. It is a term applied to what is considered as the <a name="page_243"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 243</font></a> true Mazdayasnian religion in all ages, both before and after the time of Zaratû<i>s</i>t.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1228"></a><a href="sbe0561.htm#fr_1235">243:1</a> One of the old commentators whose opinions are frequently quoted in Pahlavi books, as in Chap. II, 74, 82, 119, Pahl. Vend. III, 48, 138, 151, IV, 35, V, 14, 121, VI, 9, 64, VII, 6, 136, VIII, 64, 236, XV, 35, 48, 56, 67, XVI, 5, XVIII, 98, 124, and thirteen times in the Nîrangistân. His name is sometimes written Gô<i>s</i>asp (as it is here both in M6 and K20) and sometimes Gôgô<i>s</i>ôsp.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1229"></a><a href="sbe0561.htm#fr_1236">243:2</a> Probably a written exposition or commentary is meant.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1230"></a><a href="sbe0561.htm#fr_1237">243:3</a> This commentator is mentioned once in the Nîrangistân as Âtarô Aûharmazdân.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1231"></a><a href="sbe0561.htm#fr_1238">243:4</a> This commentator is mentioned in Chaps. II, 56, 74, 80, 118, 119, III, 13, VI, 4, 5; also in Pahl. Vend. III, 64, 69, 151, IV, 6, V, 48, 80, 107, 121, 146, 153, VI, 15, 64, 73, VII, 4, 136, 168, VIII, 28, 59, 303, IX, 184, XIII, 20, XVI, 7, 10, 17, 20-22, 27, XVIII, 98, and forty-six times in the Nîrangistân. He was a name-sake of the last of the future apostles and sons of Zaratû<i>s</i>t (see Bund. XXXII, 8), and his name is often written Sôshâns and read Saoshyôs or Sôsyô<i>s</i> by Pâzand writers.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1232"></a><a href="sbe0561.htm#fr_1239">243:5</a> This commentator is mentioned once in the Nîrangistân, and may probably be the Âtarô-frôbâg of B. Yt. I, 7; compare also Nôsâî Bûr<i>z</i> Mitrô, the name of another commentator, in Chap. VIII, 18.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1233"></a><a href="sbe0561.htm#fr_1240">243:6</a> This commentator is mentioned in Chaps. II, 1, 11, 12, 89, V, 5, 6; also in Pahl. Vend. III, 151, V, 6, 58, 107, VIII, 48, 110, IX, 132, XIII, 99, XIV, 37, and four times in the Nîrangistân. His name is sometimes written Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh or Mâî<i>d</i>ôk-mâh, and he was a namesake of Zaratû<i>s</i>t's cousin and first disciple (see Bund. XXXII, 2, 3). The Va<i>g</i>arkar<i>d</i>-i Dînîk professes to have been compiled by Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh, but there appear to have been several priests of this name (see Bund. XXXIII, 1).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1234"></a><a href="sbe0561.htm#fr_1241">243:7</a> Gô<i>s</i>asp in M6.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1235"></a><a href="sbe0561.htm#fr_1242">243:8</a> This commentator is mentioned in Chaps. II, 2, 64, 73, 88, 115, V, 5, 6; also in Pahl. Vend. III, 48, 115, V, 6, 14, 22, 58, <a name="page_244"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 244</font></a> 146, VI, 9, VII, 6, 61, 93, 136, VIII, 48, 64, 110, 250, IX, 132, XIII, 99, XIV, 14, 37, XIX, 84, Pahl. Yas. LXIV, 37, once in Farh. Okh., and thirty-eight times in the Nîrangistân.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1236"></a><a href="sbe0561.htm#fr_1243">244:1</a> Both MSS. have 'three,' although four teachings and six commentators are mentioned in the previous section, and a fifth 'teaching' is mentioned in Chap. II, 2. The original reading was more probably 'six' than 'four', as a Pahlavi 'six' requires merely the omission of a cipher to become 'three,' whereas a Pahlavi 'four' must be altered to produce the same blunder.</p>  
 <p>Several other commentators are mentioned in Pahlavi books, such Âtarô-pâ<i>d</i>, son of Dâ<i>d</i>-farukh, twice in the Nîrangistân; Âzâ<i>d</i>-mar<i>d</i> nine times in Nîr.; Barôshand Aûharmazd once in Nîr.; Dâ<i>d</i> Aûharmazd in B.

III, 3, Pahl. Yas. IX, 33, X, 57, XI, 22, XIX, 27; Mar<i>d</i>-bû<i>d</i> in Sls. II, 96, and twice in Nîr., where he is called the son of Dâ<i>d</i>gun; Nêryôsang in Sls. VIII, 13, Pahl. Vend.
