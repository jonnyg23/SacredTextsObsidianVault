 <p>1. As he (Aharman) came seventhly to fire, which was all together <i>against</i> him, the fire <i>separated</i> into five kinds <a name="fr_1028"></a><a href="#fn_1021"><font size="1">3</font></a>, which are called the Propitious, the Good diffuser, the Aûrvâzî<i>s</i>t, the Vâzî<i>s</i>t, and the Supremely-<i>benefiting</i>. 2. And it produced the Propitious fire itself in heaven (garô<i>d</i>mân); its manifestation is in the fire which is burning on the earth, and its propitiousness is this, that all the kinds are of its nature. 3. <i>The Good diffuser</i> is that which is in men and animals <a name="fr_1029"></a><a href="#fn_1022"><font size="1">4</font></a>, and its business <i>consists</i> in the digestion of the food, the sleeping of the</p>

 <p>body, <i>and</i> the brightening of the eyes. 4. The Aûrvâzî<i>s</i>t is that which is in plants, in whose seed <i>it</i> is formed, and its business <i>consists</i> in piercing the earth, warming the chilled water <a name="fr_1030"></a><a href="#fn_1023"><font size="1">1</font></a> and producing the qualities and fragrance of plants and blossoms therefrom, and elaborating the ripened produce into many fruits. 5. And the Vâzî<i>s</i>t is that which has its motion in a cloud, and its business <i>consists</i> in destroying the atmospheric gloom and darkness, and making the thickness of the atmosphere fine and propitious in quality, sifting the hail, moderately warming the water which the cloud holds, <i>and</i> making sultry weather showery. 6. The Supremely-benefiting, like the sky, is that glory whose lodgment is in the Behrâm fire <a name="fr_1031"></a><a href="#fn_1024"><font size="1">2</font></a>, as the master of the house is over the house, <i>and</i> whose propitious power <i>arises</i> from the growing brightness of the fire, the blazing forth in <a name="fr_1032"></a><a href="#fn_1025"><font size="1">3</font></a> the purity of the place, the praise of God (yazdânŏ), <i>and</i> the practice of good works. 7. And its business is <i>that</i> it struggles with the spiritual fiend, it watches the forms of the witcheswho walk up from the river <a name="fr_1033"></a><a href="#fn_1026"><font size="1">4</font></a>, wear woven clothing, disturb the luminaries by the concealment of stench, <i>and</i> by witchcraft injure the creaturesand the occurrences of destruction, burning, and celebration of witchcraft, especially at night; being an assistant of Srôsh the righteous.</p>

 <p>8. And in the beginning of the creation <a name="fr_1034"></a><a href="#fn_1027"><font size="1">1</font></a> the whole earth was delivered over into the guardianship of the sublime Frôbak fire, the mighty Gû<i>s</i>nasp fire, and the beneficial Bûr<i>z</i>în-Mitrô fire <a name="fr_1035"></a><a href="#fn_1028"><font size="1">2</font></a>, <i>which</i> are like priest, warrior, and husbandman. 9. The place of the fire Frôbak was formed <i>on</i> the Gadman-hômand ('glorious') mountain in Khvâri<i>z</i>em <a name="fr_1036"></a><a href="#fn_1029"><font size="1">3</font></a>, the fire Gû<i>s</i>nasp <i>was</i> on the Asnavand mountain in Âtarô-pâtakân, <i>and</i> the fire Bûr<i>z</i>în-Mitrô on the Rêvand mountain which is in the Ridge <i>of</i> Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, and its material manifestation in the world was the most complete.</p>  
 <p>10. In the reign of Hôshâng <a name="fr_1037"></a><a href="#fn_1030"><font size="1">4</font></a>, when men were continually going forth to the <i>other</i> regions (kêshvar) on the ox Srûvô <a name="fr_1038"></a><a href="#fn_1031"><font size="1">5</font></a>, one night, half-way, while admiring the fires, the fire-stands which were prepared in three places on the back of the ox, <i>and</i> in which the fire was, fell into the sea, and the substance of that one great fire <i>which</i> was manifest, is divided into three, <i>and</i> they established <i>it</i> on the three fire-stands, and it became itself three glories whose lodgments are in the Frôbak fire, the Gû<i>s</i>nasp fire, and the Bûr<i>z</i>în-Mitrô <a name="fr_1039"></a><a href="#fn_1032"><font size="1">6</font></a>.</p>

 <p>The coming of the religion, beginning in the time of Frâsîyâ<i>v</i> and Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar, with an anecdote of Kâî-ûs and the hero Srîtô (Av. Thrita). The manifestation of the glory of Zaratû<i>s</i>t <a name="page_187"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 187</font></a> before his birth. The begetting of Zaratû<i>s</i>t through the drinking of hôm-juice and cow's milk infused, respectively, with his guardian spirit and glory, as declared in the manuscript on 'the guidance of worship.' The connection of Zaratû<i>s</i>t with Aûharmazd, traced back through his genealogy as far as Gâyômar<i>d</i>. The persistent endeavours of the fiends to destroy Zaratû<i>s</i>t at the time of his birth, and how they were frustrated. His receiving the religion from Aûharmazd, with another anecdote of Kâî-ûs and Srîtô, and of Zaratû<i>s</i>t's exclamation on coming into the world. The enmity borne to him by five brothers of the Karapân family, and how it was frustrated; his own four brothers, and some of his wonderful deeds. The worthiness of his righteousness; his compassionate and liberal nature; his giving up worldly desires; his pity; his good selection of a wife; and what is most edifying for the soul. What occurred when he was thirty years old, and his being conducted by the archangel Vohûman to the assembly of the spirits. The questions asked by Zaratû<i>s</i>t, and Aûharmazd's replies thereto. The seven questions he asked of the seven archangels in seven different places, in the course of one winter. [Westergaard's MS. K35 ends in the middle of the second of these questions.] The five dispositions of priests, and the ten admonitions. The three preservatives of religion, with particulars about the Gâthas and the connection of the Ahunavar with the Nasks. Zaratû<i>s</i>t's obtaining one disciple, Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh, in the first ten years, and the acceptance of the religion by Vi<i>s</i>tâsp two years afterwards.</p>  
 <p>The second of the writings of Zâ<i>d</i>-sparam consists of his 'sayings about the formation of men out of body, life, and soul;' and the third (which is imperfect in all known MSS.) contains his 'sayings about producing the renovation <i>of the universe</i>.'</p>
