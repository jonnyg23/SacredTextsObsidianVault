 <p>37. And the illustrious Pêshyôtanû advances, and the fire Frôbâ, the fire Gû<i>s</i>nasp, and the triumphant fire Bûr<i>z</i>în-Mitrô will smite the fiend of excessive strength; he will extirpate the idol-temples that are the abode of demons; and they celebrate the ceremonial (ya<i>z</i>i<i>s</i>n), arrange the <i>sacred</i> twigs, solemnize the Dvâ<i>z</i>dah-hômâst, and praise me, Aûharmazd, with the archangels; this is what I foretell <a name="fr_1197"></a><a href="#fn_1190"><font size="1">1</font></a>. 38.

And the wolf period goes away, and the sheep period comes on; they establish the fire Frôbâ, the fire Gû<i>s</i>nâsp, <i>and</i> the fire Bûr<i>z</i>în-Mitrô again at their proper places, and they will properly supply the firewood and incense; and the wicked evil spirit becomes confounded and unconscious, with the demons and the progeny of gloom. 41. And so the illustrious Pêshyôtanû speaks thus: "Let the demon be destroyed, and the witch be destroyed! let the fiendishness and vileness of the demons be destroyed! and let the gloomy progeny of the demons be destroyed! The glory <a name="fr_1202"></a><a href="#fn_1195"><font size="1">3</font></a> of the religion of the Mazdayasnians prospers, and let it prosper! let the family <a name="fr_1203"></a><a href="#fn_1196"><font size="1">4</font></a> of the liberal and just, who are doers of good deeds, prosper! and let the throne of the religion and sovereignty have a good restorer!" 42. Forth comes the illustrious Pêshyôtanû, forth he comes with a hundred and fifty men of the disciples who wear black marten fur, and they take the throne of their own religion and sovereignty.'</p>  
 <p>43. Aûharmazd said to Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtâmân: This is what I foretell, when it is the end of thy millennium it is the beginning of <i>that</i> of Hûshê<i>d</i>ar <a name="fr_1204"></a><a href="#fn_1197"><font size="1">5</font></a>.</p>

 <p>50. Aûharmazd spoke thus: O Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtâmân! this is what I foretell, that this one brings the creatures back to their proper state. 51.

II, 19), and the writer seems to place his appearance some time in the middle ages, probably before the end of the thirteenth century (see the note on § 44). Darmesteter suggests that Shê<i>d</i>âsp may have been intended as a modern counterpart of Bêvarâsp (A<i>z</i>-i Dahâk), the ancient tyrant; and that this Christian invasion may be a reminiscence of the crusades.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1123"></a><a href="sbe0559.htm#fr_1130">215:5</a> I have formerly read Mûsulmân instead of min Salmân, and hence concluded that the text must have been written long <a name="page_216"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 216</font></a> after the Muhammadan conquest of Persia; but this reading is irreconcilable with the context.

 <p><a name="fn_1140"></a><a href="sbe0559.htm#fr_1147">218:5</a> See Chap. II, 63. The whole of the final clause of this section, about the fire Vi<i>s</i>nâsp, is inserted parenthetically at this point in the Pahlavi text.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1142"></a><a href="sbe0559.htm#fr_1149">218:7</a> The most obvious reading of this word is mâhîk, 'fish,' which can hardly be reconciled with the context. The view here taken is that the writer was translating from an Avesta text, and met <a name="page_219"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 219</font></a> with the word <i>k</i>ithra, which means both pê<i>d</i>âk, 'clear,' and tôkhmak, 'originating,' but to express the latter meaning he used the synonym mâyakîk, which can be written exactly like mâhîk. Owing to the involved character of this section it is not very clear in English, but it is still more obscure in the Pahlavi text, in which the whole of this clause about the fire is inserted parenthetically after the first mention of Pa<i>d</i>ashkhvârgar.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1143"></a><a href="sbe0559.htm#fr_1150">219:1</a> This last clause may be read several ways, and it is by no means easy to ascertain clearly the chronological order of the events which are jumbled together in this last chapter. But it would appear that Zaratû<i>s</i>t's millennium was to end at a time when the religion was undisturbed, and just before the incursion of the demons or idolators, the details of which have been given in Chap. II, 22-III, 11, and which is the first event of Hûshê<i>d</i>ar's millennium (see § 13). Now according to Bund. XXXIV, 7-9, the interval from 'the coming of the religion,' in the reign of Kaî-Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, to the end of the Sasanian monarchy was 90 + 112 + 30 + 12 + 14 + 14 + 284 + 460 =1016 years. If by 'the coming of the religion' be meant the time when Zaratû<i>s</i>t received it, as he was then thirty years old, he must have been born 1046 years before the end of the Sasanian monarchy (A.D. 651), and the end of his millennium must have been in A.D. 605, the sixteenth year of Khûsrô Parvîz, when the Sasanian power was near its maximum, and only a score of years before it began suddenly to collapse. This close coincidence indicates that the writer of the Bahman Ya<i>s</i>t must have adopted the same incorrect chronology as is found in the Bundahi<i>s</i>. If, however, 'the coming of the religion' mean its acceptance by Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, which occurred in Zaratû<i>s</i>t's fortieth or <a name="page_220"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 220</font></a> forty-second year, his birth must have been ten or twelve years earlier. and his millennium must have ended A.D. 593-595. But according to the imperfect chronology of Bund. XXXIV the tenth millennium of the world, that of Capricornus, commenced with 'the coming of the religion,' and ended, therefore, in A.D. 635, the fourth year of Yazdakar<i>d</i>, the last Sasanian king, when the Muhammadans were just preparing for their first invasion; so the millennium of Aquarius is very nearly coincident with that of Hûshê<i>d</i>ar, and may probably be intended to represent it. It appears, therefore, that the millennium of Hûshê<i>d</i>ar is altogether past, having extended from A.D. 593-635 to A.D. 1593-1635.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1144"></a><a href="sbe0559.htm#fr_1151">220:1</a> The Paz. MSS. omit § 12. The writer having detailed the evils of the iron age, now returns to its commencement in order to describe the means adopted for partially counteracting those evils.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1153"></a><a href="sbe0559.htm#fr_1160">221:6</a> Spiegel was inclined to identify this name with Bombay, but this is impossible, as the MS.

The locality mentioned in the text is, evidently to be sought on the banks of the Oxus near Bukhârâ; the Oxus having been sometimes considered the upper course of the Arag, and sometimes that of the Veh (see Bund. XX, 22, note 5). It is hardly probable that either Bâmî (Balkh) or Bâmiyân would be changed into Bambŏ, and the only exact representative of this name appears to be Bamm, a town about 120 miles S.

 <p><a name="fn_1175"></a><a href="sbe0559.htm#fr_1182">224:8</a> This was the twentieth nask or 'book' of the complete Mazdayasnian literature, according to the Dînkar<i>d</i>; but the Dînî-va<i>g</i>arkar<i>d</i> and the Rivâyats make it the twenty-first, and say very <a name="page_225"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 225</font></a> little about its contents (see Haug's Essays, pp. 133, 134). The Dînkar<i>d</i>, in its eighth book, gives the following account of this Nask:</p>  
 <p>The Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht as it exists <i>has</i> three divisions among its 133 sections. The first <i>has</i> thirteen (twelve?) sections, treatises upon the nature of the recital of the Ahunavar, which is the spiritual benefit from chanting it aloud, and whatever is on the same subject. Admonition about selecting <i>and</i> keeping a spiritual and worldly high-priest, performing every duty as to the high-priest, <i>and</i> maintaining even those of various high-priests. On the twenty-one chieftainships of the spirits in Aûharmazd, and of the worldly existences in Zaratû<i>s</i>t, among which are the worship of God <i>and</i> the management of the devout. On the duty <i>requisite</i> in each of the five different periods of the day and night, and <i>the fate at</i> the <i>celestial</i> bridge of him who shall be zealous in the celebration of the season-festivals; he who does not provide the preparations for the feast of the season-festivals, and who is yet efficient in the other worship of God. On how to consider, <i>and</i> what to do with, a leader of the high-priest class and a man of the <i>inferior</i> classes; he who atones for unimportant sin, and he who does not atone even for <i>that which</i> is important, <i>and</i> whatever is on the same subject. On the apparatus with which ploughed land (?) is prepared. On the manifestation of virtuous manhood, and the merit and advantage from uttering good words <i>for blessing</i> the eating and drinking of food and drink, and rebuking the inward talk of the demons. On the recitations at the five periods of the day, and the ceremonial invocation by name of many angels, each separately, <i>and</i> great information on the same subject; the worthiness of a man restrained by authority the giving of life and body to the angel the good rulers, and their examination and satisfaction; the blessing and winning words which are most successful in carrying off the affliction which <i>proceeds</i> from a fiend. On all-pleasing creativeness and omniscience, and all precedence (?), leadership, foresight(?), worthy liberality, virtue (?), and every proper cause and effect of righteousness; the individuality of righteousness, the opposition to the demons of Aûharmazd's opinion, and also much other information in the same section.</p>  
 <p>The middle <i>division has</i> 102 sections, treatises on spiritual and worldly diligence, the leadership of the diligent, and their mighty <a name="page_226"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 226</font></a> means, all former deeds of righteousness; righteousness kindling the resolution is the reward of merit, each for each, and is adapted by it for that <i>of</i> which it is said that <i>it is</i> the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht which is the maintaining of righteousness, so that they may make righteousness more abiding in the body of a man.</p>  
 <p>'The last <i>division has</i> nineteen sections of trusty remedies, that is, remedies whose utterance aloud by the faithful is a chief resource among the creatures of God; also the nature of sayings full of humility, well-favoured, most select, <i>and</i> adapted for that <i>of</i> which it is said that I reverence that chief, the excellent and eminent Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht, of which they trust in the sustaining strength of every word of Zaratû<i>s</i>t. Perfect is the excellence of righteousness (Av. ashem vohû vahi<i>s</i>tem astî).'</p>  
 <p>According to tradition three chapters of this Nask are still extant, being the Ya<i>s</i>t fragments XXI, XXII of Westergaard's edition of the Avesta Texts; but they do not correspond to any part of the description in the Dînkar<i>d</i>. For a description of Dvâzdah-hômâst see Chap. II, 59.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1176"></a><a href="sbe0559.htm#fr_1183">226:1</a> See Bund. XII, 7.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1184"></a><a href="sbe0559.htm#fr_1191">228:1</a> The fact that the angel Vâhrâm goes in his spiritual forth to the assistance of Pêshyôtanû, rather militates against the idea that be also goes in the form of Vâhrâm the Var<i>g</i>âvand.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1185"></a><a href="sbe0559.htm#fr_1192">228:2</a> This verb is omitted by mistake in K20.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1186"></a><a href="sbe0559.htm#fr_1193">228:3</a> Literally, 'arrive at the writing.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1187"></a><a href="sbe0559.htm#fr_1194">228:4</a> Or, 'stand up with honesty.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1188"></a><a href="sbe0559.htm#fr_1195">228:5</a> The latter two names are here written Frâsâ<i>v</i> and Alasandar.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1189"></a><a href="sbe0559.htm#fr_1196">228:6</a> From this it appears that the writer expected the evil reign of the unbelievers to last a thousand years, that is, till the end of Hûshê<i>d</i>ar's millennium, about A.D. 1593-1635, which corresponds very closely with the reign of the great Shâh Abbâs.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1190"></a><a href="sbe0559.htm#fr_1197">229:1</a> Or, perhaps 'what I said before,' being already narrated in § 29 as performed by Pêshyôtanû before advancing far into Iran.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1192"></a><a href="sbe0559.htm#fr_1199">229:3</a> Probably a title of Pêshyôtanû; a more obvious translation would be, 'restrains a curbed temper, and is intrusted,' &amp;c,, but it is hardly probable that the warrior prince Vâhrâm could become a priest. It is Vâhrâm's business to restore the empire, leaving Pêshyôtanû to restore the religion.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1194"></a><a href="sbe0559.htm#fr_1201">230:2</a> Merely a guess, as the verb varafsê<i>d</i> is difficult to understand.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1195"></a><a href="sbe0559.htm#fr_1202">230:3</a> K20 has nismô, 'soul,' but the very similarly written gadman, 'glory,' is a more likely reading here (see § 32).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1196"></a><a href="sbe0559.htm#fr_1203">230:4</a> Reading dû<i>d</i>ak instead of rû<i>d</i>ak, as in Chap. II, 47.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1197"></a><a href="sbe0559.htm#fr_1204">230:5</a> The writer having detailed the supernatural means employed for restoring the religion, now returns to the birth of Hûshê<i>d</i>ar <a name="page_231"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 231</font></a> (§ 13) for the purpose of mentioning some of his actions, and making the chronology of his millennium rather more clear. Nothing is said here about his miraculous birth, the details of which are given in the seventh book of the Dînkar<i>d</i> very much as they are found in the Persian Rivâyats. The Dînkar<i>d</i> states that thirty years before the end of Zaratû<i>s</i>t's millennium a young maiden bathing in certain water, and drinking it, becomes pregnant through the long-preserved seed of Zaratû<i>s</i>t (see Bund. XXXII, 8, 9), and subsequently gives birth to Hûshê<i>d</i>ar.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1198"></a><a href="sbe0559.htm#fr_1205">231:1</a> There seems to be no other rational way of understanding this number than by supposing that it represents the date of Hûshê<i>d</i>ar's birth, counting from the beginning of Zaratû<i>s</i>t's millennium. According to this view Hûshê<i>d</i>ar was to be born in the six hundredth year of his own millennium, and not at its beginning, as § 13 seems to imply, nor nearly thirty years earlier, as the Dînkar<i>d</i> asserts. As the beginning of his millennium may be fixed about A.D. 593-635 (see note on § 11), the writer must have expected him to be born about A.D. 1193-1235; a time which was probably far in the future when he was writing. And as Vâhrâm the Var<i>g</i>âvand was to be born when Hûshê<i>d</i>ar was thirty years of age (compare §§ 14) 44), and was to march into Iran at the age of thirty (§ 17), the great conflict of the nations (§§ 8, 19-22) was expected to begin about A.D. 1253-1295, and to continue till near the end of the millennium, about A.D. 1593-1635, when Pêshyôtanû was expected to appear (§ 51) and to restore the 'good' religion (§§ 26, 37, 42). An enthusiastic Parsi interpreter of prophecy might urge that though this period did not witness any revival of his religion, it did witness a restoration of the Persian empire under Shâh Abbâs, and also the first beginning of British power in India, which has been so great a benefit to the scanty, remnant of his fellow-countrymen.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1201"></a><a href="sbe0559.htm#fr_1208">232:2</a> It is just possible to read, 'the sun with the swift horse, the splendid, moves on, and all mankind fully believe,' &amp;c. But if the reading in the text be correct it effectually disposes of the idea of Vâhrâm being an incarnation of the angel, as an angel would require no miracle to make him believe in the religion.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1202"></a><a href="sbe0559.htm#fr_1209">232:3</a> See §§ 25-30.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1203"></a><a href="sbe0559.htm#fr_1210">232:4</a> This verb is doubtful, as most of the word is torn off in K20.</p>

The Dînkar<i>d</i> gives the same account of the miraculous birth of Hûshê<i>d</i>ar-mâh as of the first Hûshê<i>d</i>ar (see note on § 43); it also repeats the legend of the sun standing still, but for the longer period of twenty days; all which details are also found in the Persian Rivâyats.</p>
