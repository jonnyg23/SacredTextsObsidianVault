 <p>1. This also is said, that when the primeval ox <a name="fr_99"></a><a href="#fn_99"><font size="1">1</font></a> passed away it fell to the right hand, <i>and</i> Gâyômar<i>d</i> afterwards, when he passed <i>away</i>, to the left hand. 2. Gô<i>s</i>ûrvan <a name="fr_100"></a><a href="#fn_100"><font size="1">2</font></a>, as the soul of the primeval ox came out from the body of the ox, stood up before the ox <i>and</i> cried to Aûharmazd, as much as a thousand men when they sustain a cry at one time, thus: 'With whom is the guardianship of the creatures left by thee, when ruin <i>has</i> broken into the earth, and vegetation is withered, and water is troubled? Where is the man <a name="fr_101"></a><a href="#fn_101"><font size="1">3</font></a> of whom it was said by thee thus: I <i>will</i> produce <i>him</i>, so that he may preach carefulness?'</p>  
 <p>3. And Aûharmazd spoke thus: 'You are made ill <a name="fr_102"></a><a href="#fn_102"><font size="1">4</font></a>, O Gô<i>s</i>ûrvan! you, have the illness which the evil spirit brought on if it were proper to produce that man in this earth at this time, the. evil spirit would not have been oppressive in it.'</p>

 <p>4. Forth Gô<i>s</i>ûrvan walked to the star station (pâyak) <i>and</i> cried in the same manner, and forth to the moon station <i>and</i> cried in the same manner, <i>and</i> forth to the sun station, and then the guardian spirit of Zaratû<i>s</i>t was exhibited to her, <i>and Aûharmazd said</i> thus <a name="fr_103"></a><a href="#fn_103"><font size="1">1</font></a>: 'I will produce for the world <i>him</i> who will preach carefulness.' 5. Contented became the spirit Gô<i>s</i>ûrvan, and assented thus: 'I will nourish the creatures;' that is, she became again consenting to a worldly creation in the world.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_99"></a><a href="sbe0513.htm#fr_99">20:1</a> Literally, 'the sole-created ox' from whom all the animals and some plants are supposed to have proceeded (see Chaps. X and XIV), as mankind proceeded from Gâyômar<i>d</i>. It is the ox of the primitive creation, mentioned in Chap. III, 14, 18.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_100"></a><a href="sbe0513.htm#fr_100">20:2</a> The spiritual representative of the primeval ox, called G<i>e</i>u<i>s</i>-urvâ, 'soul of the bull,' in the Avesta, of which name Gô<i>s</i>ûrvan is a corruption. The complaint of Gô<i>s</i>ûrvan is recorded in the Gâthas, the oldest part of the Avesta (see Yas, XXIX).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_101"></a><a href="sbe0513.htm#fr_101">20:3</a> Referring to Zaratû<i>s</i>t.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_102"></a><a href="sbe0513.htm#fr_102">20:4</a> In K20, 'You are ill.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_103"></a><a href="sbe0513.htm#fr_103">21:1</a> As the text stands in the MSS. it means, 'and then the guardian spirit of Zaratû<i>s</i>t demonstrated to her thus;' but whether it be intended to represent the fravâhar as producing the creature is doubtful. The angel Gô<i>s</i>, who is identified with Gô<i>s</i>ûrvan, is usually considered a female, but this is hardly consistent with being the soul of a bull (see Chap. X, 1, 2), though applicable enough to a representative of the earth. In the Selections of Zâ<i>d</i>-sparam, II, 6, however, this mythological animal is said to have been a female (see Appendix to Bundahi<i>s</i>).</p>
