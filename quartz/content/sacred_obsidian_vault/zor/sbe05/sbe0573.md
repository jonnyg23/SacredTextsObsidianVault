 <p>4. Ahyâ-yâsâ (Yas. XXVIII), Khshmaibyâ (Yas. XXIX), and A<i>d</i>-tâ-vakhshâ (Yas. XXX) <i>have</i>, severally, eleven stanzas (va<i>k</i>êst), because eleven things move spiritually within the bodies of men, as life, consciousness, religion, soul, guardian spirit, thought, word, deed, seeing, smelling, and hearing; and the bodies of men and other creatures are formed of water, fire, and wind <a name="fr_1775"></a><a href="#fn_1763"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>5. Ashem-Ahurem-mazdãm (Visp. XV) is <i>to be recited</i> <a name="fr_1776"></a><a href="#fn_1764"><font size="1">2</font></a> three times before the coming of Hûshê<i>d</i>ar, Hûshê<i>d</i>ar-mâh, and Sôshyans; and when they also recite the chapter (hâ<i>d</i>) well, and by line (gâs) and stanza, those <i>apostles</i> are present <a name="fr_1777"></a><a href="#fn_1765"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and the</p>

 <p><a name="page_356"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 356</font></a></p>  
 <p>country becomes more flourishing and more dominant in the world.</p>  
 <p>6. The twenty-two stanzas of Tâ-v<i>e</i>-urvâtâ (Yas. XXXI) are the twenty-two judgments (dâ<i>d</i>istân) of which it speaks in the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht <i>Nask</i> <a name="fr_1778"></a><a href="#fn_1766"><font size="1">1</font></a> thus:'Anaomô mananghê daya vîspâi kva, kva parô?' (where are <i>they</i> to be produced beyond every thought? <i>and</i> where before?') 'Lodging in the judge, that while <i>he has</i> twenty-two judgments <i>he may be</i> more just;'so that when they pray the Tâ-v<i>e</i>-urvâtâ chapter well, and recite <i>it</i> by line and stanza, the judges possess those twenty-two judgments more correctly, and judiciousness is more lodging <i>in them</i>.</p>  
 <p>7. The sixteen stanzas of the <i>H</i><i>v</i>aêtumaithi <i>chapter</i> (Yas. XXXII) <a name="fr_1779"></a><a href="#fn_1767"><font size="1">2</font></a> are lodging in warriors, so that it becomes possible, during their good protection, to force the enemy <i>away</i> from those sixteen countries which the Vendidad <a name="fr_1780"></a><a href="#fn_1768"><font size="1">3</font></a> mentions in <i>its</i> first fargar<i>d</i>.</p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_357"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 357</font></a></p>  
 <p>8. The fourteen stanzas of Yathâ-âi<i>s</i> (Yas. XXXIII) are for this reason, because seven archangels are more diligent in activity <i>for</i> the spirit, and seven archangels <a name="fr_1781"></a><a href="#fn_1769"><font size="1">1</font></a> for the world, so that they may attain 'to heaven, the home (mêhônŏ) of Aûharmazd, the home of the archangels, the home of those righteous ones,' avi garô-nmânem, maêthanem Ahurahê mazd<i>a</i>u, maêthanem ameshanãm spe<i>n</i>tanãm, maêthanem anyaêshãm ashaonãm <a name="fr_1782"></a><a href="#fn_1770"><font size="1">2</font></a>. 9. The three repetitions (dânar) of Y<i>e</i>-s<i>e</i>vi<i>s</i>tô (Yas. XXXIII, 11) <a name="fr_1783"></a><a href="#fn_1771"><font size="1">3</font></a>, <i>and</i> the holding up of the holy-water (zôhar) at these <i>repetitions</i>, are for the four classes <a name="fr_1784"></a><a href="#fn_1772"><font size="1">4</font></a>, and for this <i>reason</i> at Ahurâi mazdâi <i>and</i> ashem<i>k</i>â frâda<i>d</i> <a name="fr_1785"></a><a href="#fn_1773"><font size="1">5</font></a> the holy-water is</p>

 <p>to be held level with the heart of him who is the officiating priest (zôt), and at sraotâ <a name="fr_1786"></a><a href="#fn_1774"><font size="1">1</font></a> <i>it</i> is to be held level with the arm of him who is the officiating priest, so that while the warriors are in battle with foreigners (anâîrân) they may be fuller of breath (vayô-gîrtar), and the husbandmen stronger-armed in the tillage and cultivation of the world.</p>  
 <p>10. The fifteen stanzas of Yâ-<i>s</i>kyaothanâ (Yas. XXXIV) are for this reason, because it is given <a name="fr_1787"></a><a href="#fn_1775"><font size="1">2</font></a> for the destruction of those fifteen fiends who are disclosed in the medical part (bêshâ<i>z</i>) of the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht <i>Nask</i> <a name="fr_1788"></a><a href="#fn_1776"><font size="1">3</font></a>. 11. The four repetitions (bâr) of Mazdâ-a<i>d</i>-môi (Yas. XXXIV, 15) <a name="fr_1789"></a><a href="#fn_1777"><font size="1">4</font></a> are for the right coming on of the share of these five chieftainships (ra<i>d</i>îh), the house-ruler, the village-ruler, the tribe-ruler, the province-ruler, and the supreme Zaratû<i>s</i>t <a name="fr_1790"></a><a href="#fn_1778"><font size="1">5</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>12. The two repetitions of Ahyâ-yâsâ (Yas. XVIII, 1) <a name="fr_1791"></a><a href="#fn_1779"><font size="1">6</font></a>, are for this reason, that the sovereign (dahyûpat) may not at once seize body, consciousness,</p>

 <p>and soul. 13. Those four Yathâ-ahû-vairyôs of the first <i>Gâtha</i> <a name="fr_1792"></a><a href="#fn_1780"><font size="1">1</font></a> are for this reason, that is, so that inferiors may become more tolerant of the commands of superiors, and good thoughts, good words, and good deeds be more domesticated (mâhmântar) in the world, and the fiend more powerless (apâ<i>d</i>akhshâhtar).</p>  
 <p>14. In short (aê-mar) <a name="fr_1793"></a><a href="#fn_1781"><font size="1">2</font></a>, Ahyâ-yâsâ is as (pavan) <a name="fr_1794"></a><a href="#fn_1782"><font size="1">3</font></a> Aûharmazd and the righteous man, Khshmaibyâ as Vohûman and cattle, A<i>d</i>-tâ-vakhshyâ as Ar<i>d</i>avahi<i>s</i>t and fire, Tâ-v<i>e</i>-urvâtâ as Shatvaîrô <a name="fr_1795"></a><a href="#fn_1783"><font size="1">4</font></a> and metal, the <i>H</i><i>v</i>aêtumaithi as the Gâtha of Spendarma<i>d</i> and the earth, Yatha-âi<i>s</i> as Horvada<i>d</i> and water, and Yâ-<i>s</i>kyaothanâ as Amerôda<i>d</i> and plants.</p>  
 <p>15. The progress which is in <a name="fr_1796"></a><a href="#fn_1784"><font size="1">5</font></a> the Ahunavaiti Gâtha the house-rulers should carry on; that which is in the U<i>s</i>tavaiti Gâtha the village-rulers should carry on; that which is in the Spe<i>n</i>tâ-mainyû <a name="fr_1797"></a><a href="#fn_1785"><font size="1">6</font></a> Gâtha the tribe-rulers should carry on; that which is in the Vohû-khshathra Gâtha the province-rulers should carry on; that which is in the Vahi<i>s</i>tô-i<i>s</i>ti Gathâ the supreme Zaratû<i>s</i>ts should carry on, and</p>

 <p>that which is in the Yasna, which is the place of righteous blessing <a name="fr_1798"></a><a href="#fn_1786"><font size="1">1</font></a>, these four classes themselves should carry on.</p>  
 <p>16. Of the Yasna <i>of seven chapters</i> (Yas. XXXV-XLI, 17) the beginning section (kar<i>d</i>akŏ) <i>has</i> nine stanzas; and its beginning <a name="fr_1799"></a><a href="#fn_1787"><font size="1">2</font></a> is Humatanãm (Yas. XXXV, 4), and its end is Humatanãm (Yas. XLI, 17 supl.)</p>  
 <p>17. The six stanzas of Ahyâ-thwâ-âthrô (Yas, XXXVI) are owing to the six hot ordeals (var) which, in the Hûspâram <i>Nask</i> <a name="fr_1800"></a><a href="#fn_1788"><font size="1">3</font></a>, are effected by <i>k</i>athrayâim âthraiãm <a name="fr_1801"></a><a href="#fn_1789"><font size="1">4</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>18. The five stanzas of Ithâ-â<i>d</i>-yazamaidê (Yas. XXXVII) are thanksgiving and praise for the production of the good creations by Aûharmazd.</p>  
 <p>19. The five stanzas of Imãm-âa<i>d</i>-zãm (Yas. XXXVIII) are owing to those five comforts and five discomforts of the earth, which, it is declared in the third fargar<i>d</i> in the Vendidad <a name="fr_1802"></a><a href="#fn_1790"><font size="1">5</font></a> are accomplished</p>

 <p>thus:'The first comfort of the earth is from the land on which a righteous man walks forth; the second is when they shall make the dwelling of the good and fires upon it; the third is when they sow corn upon it, and shall take heed of dead matter; the fourth is when all beasts <i>of burden</i> are born upon it; the fifth is when every beast <i>of burden</i> is on it <a name="fr_1803"></a><a href="#fn_1791"><font size="1">1</font></a>; and its first discomfort is from the Arezûr ridge <a name="fr_1804"></a><a href="#fn_1792"><font size="1">2</font></a> and the gate of hell; the second is when they dig <a name="fr_1805"></a><a href="#fn_1793"><font size="1">3</font></a> it up <i>for</i> a dead <i>body</i>; the third is when <i>one</i> constructs a depository <i>for the dead</i> (khazân) <a name="fr_1806"></a><a href="#fn_1794"><font size="1">4</font></a> upon it; the fourth is from the holes of its noxious creatures; the fifth is when they shall forsake a man in affliction (var<i>d</i>akîh) upon it, who is righteous.'</p>  
 <p>20. The five stanzas of Ithâ (Yas. XXXIX) are just as those which <i>go</i> before.</p>  
 <p>21. The four stanzas of Âhû-a<i>d</i>-paiti (Yas. XL) are about the benefit (ar<i>g</i>-hômandîh) which is on account of water, earth, plants, and animals.</p>  
 <p>22. The six stanzas of Stûtô-garô (Yas. XLI, 117), the two repetitions of Humatanãm (Yas. XX XV, 4-6), <i>and</i> the three repetitions of Hukhshathrôtemâi (Yas. XXXV, 13-15) are on account of the existence of the sons of Zaratû<i>s</i>t <a name="fr_1807"></a><a href="#fn_1795"><font size="1">5</font></a>.</p>

 <p>28. The twenty stanzas of Ta<i>d</i>-thwâ-peresâ (Yas. XLIII) are the twenty judgments (dâ<i>d</i>istân) between the beneficent spirit and the evil spirit; and for this <i>reason</i> they should every time utter Ta<i>d</i>-thwâ-peresâ again <a name="fr_1815"></a><a href="#fn_1803"><font size="1">1</font></a>, because they should utter the original judgment again, and the twentieth time the evil spirit becomes confounded.</p>  
 <p>29. The eleven stanzas of A<i>d</i>-fravakhshyâ (Yas. XLIV) are made up from the six chieftainships <a name="fr_1816"></a><a href="#fn_1804"><font size="1">2</font></a> and the five accomplishments (farhâng) owing to religion; one is thus, not to do unto others <a name="fr_1817"></a><a href="#fn_1805"><font size="1">3</font></a> all that which is not well for one's self; the second is to understand fully <i>what</i> is well-done and not-well-done; the third is to turn from the vile and their conversation (andarag-gûftanŏ); the fourth is to confess <i>one's</i> failings to the high-priests, and let them bring the whip; the fifth is not to neglect the season-festivals at <i>their proper</i> hour (dên hâsar), <i>nor</i> the other things which go to the bridge <a name="fr_1818"></a><a href="#fn_1806"><font size="1">4</font></a>; and the six chieftainships are not his property who has not these</p>

The term Gâtha or 'hymn' (Pahl. gâs) is applied, in this chapter, not only to the five Gâthas properly so called, but also to the Yasna of seven chapters, and apparently to <a name="page_353"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 353</font></a> other portions of the Yasna written in the Gâtha dialect of the Avesta.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1749"></a><a href="sbe0573.htm#fr_1761">353:1</a> This appears to be the meaning, but the construction of this section is altogether very obscure, and the text is more or less corrupt in all MSS.

IV, 38-114, &amp;c., which were formerly used for the temporal punishment of sinners. Whether they are here brought to the neophyte as a token of his admission to the priesthood, or are administered to him as a punishment for his offences, is not quite clear.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1759"></a><a href="sbe0573.htm#fr_1771">354:4</a> The five Gâthas are the Ahunavaiti (Yas. XXVIII-XXXIV), the U<i>s</i>tavaiti (Yas. XLII-XLV), the Spe<i>n</i>tâ-mainyû (Yas. XLVI-XLIX), the Vohû-khshathra (Yas. L), and the Vahi<i>s</i>tôi<i>s</i>ti (Yas. LII); these collections of hymns are thus named from the words with which each of them commences, excepting the first, which derives its name from the Ahunavar (see Bund. I, 21) which is written in the same metre.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1760"></a><a href="sbe0573.htm#fr_1772">354:5</a> This is the Pahlavi form of the Parsi navazûdi, a term applied to the whole initiatory ceremonial of a nônâbar, or newly initiated priest; the term evidently implies that the ceremony is considered somewhat in the light of 'regeneration.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1761"></a><a href="sbe0573.htm#fr_1773">354:6</a> That is, he can take his part in the regular priestly duties, including the initiation of other neophytes.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1762"></a><a href="sbe0573.htm#fr_1774">354:7</a> Both K20 and M6 have four in ciphers, which can hardly be right; the sentence is clear enough, but the idea of its writer is rather obscure.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1763"></a><a href="sbe0573.htm#fr_1775">355:1</a> These first three chapters of the Ahunavaiti collection of hymns are here supposed to symbolize the three material elements, whose union distinguishes a man's body from inorganic substances; while the eleven stanzas, which each of these chapters contains, symbolize the eleven immaterial existences said to be contained in the same body.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1764"></a><a href="sbe0573.htm#fr_1776">355:2</a> This is doubtful, as no verb is expressed, and, the word bâr, 'time,' is struck out in M6, so it is possible to read 'the "three foremost" of the Ashem-Ahurem-mazdãm are the coming of Hûshê<i>d</i>ar,' &amp;c. The 'three foremost' (3 levînŏg) would be a possible Pahlavi translation of the Av. ti<i>s</i>rô paoiryô and ti<i>s</i>ra paoirya of Visp. XV, 4-6, instead of the actual 'three first' (3-i fratûm), as may be seen from Pahl. Visp. VIII, 17, 20, where both pê<i>s</i> (= levînŏ) and fratûm are used indifferently for Av. paoiryô. At any rate the idea embodied in the text is that these 'three first' have some reference to the three future apostles of the Parsi religion (see Bund. XXXII, 8, B. Yt. III, 13, 44, 52, 62). In fact, however, they seem to refer to the first three chapters of the Ahunavaiti Gâtha, immediately after which this chapter (Visp. XV) is recited in the full Parsi ritual; the phrase being rendered in the Pahlavi translation thus:'I reverence the three first by not speaking out, that is, I do not say anything during them, and not wearing out, that is, I do not doze away during them.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1765"></a><a href="sbe0573.htm#fr_1777">355:3</a> K20 has 'arrive early.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1766"></a><a href="sbe0573.htm#fr_1778">356:1</a> See B. Yt. III, 25. Both the Avesta text here quoted and the translation suggested must be received with caution, as the MSS. do not agree in the three central words; K20 has mana<font size="-1">N</font>hê de vîspâi kaua, and M6 has mana<font size="-1">N</font>hê kya vîsâi kaia. The former reading has been adopted, with very slight correction, as it seems the more intelligible; but the meaning of the preceding word, anaomô, is, far from certain. The writer seems to have been quoting from a Pahlavi version of the Nask which contained this Avesta quotation.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1767"></a><a href="sbe0573.htm#fr_1779">356:2</a> This Hâ, which begins with the words a<i>h</i><i>v</i>yâ<i>k</i>â <i>h</i><i>v</i>aêtu<i>s</i>, is not called by its initial words, as the preceding chapters are, but has this special name (see the prayers at the end of it) derived from its second word, and which is corrupted in Pahlavi into Khvêtmanŏ.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1769"></a><a href="sbe0573.htm#fr_1781">357:1</a> The seven archangels besides their spiritual duties have severally charge of the seven worldly existences, man, animals, fire, metal, earth, water, and plants (see § 14 and Chap.

 <p><a name="fn_1770"></a><a href="sbe0573.htm#fr_1782">357:2</a> This quotation, of which the Pahlavi translation is first given, and then the Avesta text, is from Vend. XIX, 107.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1771"></a><a href="sbe0573.htm#fr_1783">357:3</a> This stanza is recited thrice, and about the same time the officiating priest strains the Hôm juice, and prepares to pour holy-water into the mortar in which the Hôm twigs were pounded (see Haug's Essays, pp. 402, 406).</p>

Both K20 and M6 have 'four classes,' but this is inconsistent with the 'three repetitions.' The Avesta generally knows only three classes, but four are mentioned in the Baghân Ya<i>s</i>t (Yas. XIX, 46).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1774"></a><a href="sbe0573.htm#fr_1786">358:1</a> The first word in the third line of the stanza; but this, again, has to be guessed from a Pahlavi version in the MSS. which may be read va vâ-srôdâân.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1779"></a><a href="sbe0573.htm#fr_1791">358:6</a> This first stanza of the Ahunavaiti Gâtha is recited twice, not only in its proper place (as the first stanza of each chapter is, in the Gâthas), but also at the end of every chapter of the Ahunavaiti Gâtha, while the officiating priest sprinkles the sacred twigs with the sacred milk or gâu<i>s</i> <i>g</i>îvya, 'living-cow produce' (see Haug's Essays, pp. 405, 406).</p>

This last clause, which is omitted in M6, connects these later hymns with the four classes of the community (see § 9), just as the five older hymns are connected with the five chiefs of the community (see § 11) in the former clauses. This section may be a translation from the Avesta, as the verbs precede their nominatives.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1789"></a><a href="sbe0573.htm#fr_1801">360:4</a> These Avesta words are evidently corrupt, but perhaps 'a quadruple fire' is meant. K20 has <i>k</i>athrâyâim âthraiãm.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1791"></a><a href="sbe0573.htm#fr_1803">361:1</a> The verb is probably omitted by mistake, and we ought to read 'voids urine upon it,' in accordance with Vend. III, 20.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1794"></a><a href="sbe0573.htm#fr_1806">361:4</a> See Chap. II, 6.</p>

Having completed the enumeration of the sections of the Yasna of seven chapters, the writer is now proceeding to notice those passages which are recited more than once in the performance of the ritual.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1796"></a><a href="sbe0573.htm#fr_1808">362:1</a> M6 has gairî, 'in a song,' with the obsolete g, which is very like s, and is also used in the word garô in § 22; this is a variant well worth consideration by translators of the Avesta. K20 has only Ashahyâ.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1801"></a><a href="sbe0573.htm#fr_1813">362:6</a> The first chapter of the U<i>s</i>tavaiti Gâtha (see § 2, note 4), so called from its first word u<i>s</i>tâ.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1803"></a><a href="sbe0573.htm#fr_1815">363:1</a> That is, the first line (ta<i>d</i> thwâ peresâ ere<i>s</i> môi vao<i>k</i>â Ahurâ! 'that I shall ask thee, tell <i>it</i> me right, O Ahura!') is repeated at the beginning of each of the first nineteen stanzas, and the first stanza being recited twice (as in all chapters of the Gâthas) these words are recited twenty times before the last stanza is reached. The phrases 'and for this <i>reason</i>' and 'because they should utter the original judgment again' are omitted in M6.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1804"></a><a href="sbe0573.htm#fr_1816">363:2</a> These cannot be the same 'chieftainships' (ra<i>d</i>îh) as those mentioned in § 11, of which there are only five; but perhaps they are the spiritual chieftainships, or primacies, of the six other regions of the earth (see Bund. XXIX, 1).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1812"></a><a href="sbe0573.htm#fr_1824">364:6</a> The first stanza of the U<i>s</i>tavaiti Gâtha, which is recited twice, both in its proper place and at the end of each chapter of that Gâtha (see § 12, note).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1817"></a><a href="sbe0573.htm#fr_1829">365:3</a> It seems probable that the Pahlavi writer has here confounded Spendamat, 'the beneficent spirit,' with the archangel Spendarma<i>d</i> who has special charge of the earth; their names being even more alike in Pahlavi than in English, though corrupted from the distinct Avesta forms spe<i>n</i>ta mainyu and spe<i>n</i>ta ârmaiti, respectively.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1818"></a><a href="sbe0573.htm#fr_1830">365:4</a> Visp. XXII follows Yas. XLIX in the full Parsi ritual, and is recited twice.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1822"></a><a href="sbe0573.htm#fr_1834">365:8</a> The archangel who has special charge of metal (see § 14, Chap. XV, 5, 14-19, and Bund. I, 26, XXX, 19); the name is here written Shatrîvar.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1823"></a><a href="sbe0573.htm#fr_1835">366:1</a> After the two recitations of Visp. XXIII, 1-9 there follow Vend. XV, XVI, and Visp. XXIII, 10, and then Visp. XXIV, 1-12 is recited twice, in the full Parsi ritual, followed by Visp. XXV.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1824"></a><a href="sbe0573.htm#fr_1836">366:2</a> Some words are evidently lost here; M6 has m followed by a blank space, and K20 has madam, 'on.' It is not quite certain whether the things mentioned are to be reckoned as four, five, or six; but assuming they are five, it is possible that the four things missing in the text are the four remaining chieftainships (see § 11), the rulerships of the house, village, tribe, and province lodged in the rulers of the same respectively.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1825"></a><a href="sbe0573.htm#fr_1837">366:3</a> Which stanza has five lines, and is, therefore, here considered symbolical of the ruling monarch, or pontiff.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1826"></a><a href="sbe0573.htm#fr_1838">366:4</a> This Avesta passage does not appear to be extant elsewhere, and its Pahlavi translation, given in the text, is not quite correct it would be better thus: 'through the "blessing of the holy" four times every night;' dahma âfriti (Pahl. dâhmân âfrînô, 'blessing of the holy') is the technical name of Yas. LIX.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1827"></a><a href="sbe0573.htm#fr_1839">366:5</a> See Bund. XIX, 33, XXX, 29. This angel, invoked by the 'blessing' (Yas. LIX, 8), comes to defend mankind against the wiles of Bûshâsp and Aêshm.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1828"></a><a href="sbe0573.htm#fr_1840">366:6</a> The demoness of sloth (see Bund. XXVIII, 26).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1831"></a><a href="sbe0573.htm#fr_1843">367:2</a> The first stanza of the Vahi<i>s</i>tôi<i>s</i>ti Gâtha, which is recited twice, both at the beginning and end of the chapter (see § 12, note).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1832"></a><a href="sbe0573.htm#fr_1844">367:3</a> Visp. XXVI follows Yas. LII in the full Parsi ritual, and is recited twice, followed by Vend. XIX, XX.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1833"></a><a href="sbe0573.htm#fr_1845">367:4</a> So called from its first words â airy<i>e</i>mâ; it is recited four times after Vend. XX, and shortly afterwards Visp. XXVII is also recited four times, as mentioned in § 48.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1834"></a><a href="sbe0573.htm#fr_1846">367:5</a> M6 has 'of the soul,' which is, no doubt, a blunder due to the illegibility of the MS. from which it was copied.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1835"></a><a href="sbe0573.htm#fr_1847">367:6</a> This is the Fshûshô-mãthra ('a spell or prayer for prosperity.') Of Visp. I, 28, II, 30, Yas. LVI, ix, 6, LVIII, 13. Whether the remainder of Yas. LVII is to be considered as pertaining to the Gâthas is uncertain; it is recited in seven sections by the assistant priest, each section from a different position; these seven positions being the stations of the seven assistant priests who are supposed to be present spiritually, and to be arranged three on each side, and one at the south end, of the ceremonial area, while the chief officiating priest occupies the north end (see Haug's Essays, p. 332).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1836"></a><a href="sbe0573.htm#fr_1848">368:1</a> The numbers of the stanzas and lines are correct, as may be seen from the details given in § 51. Regarding the words there is the uncertainty as to what constitutes a compound word, but, taking each compound in Westergaard's edition of the texts as a single word, the total number of words in the 1016 lines is about 6147; and this could be reduced to 5567 only by omitting the Yasna of seven chapters, and somewhat relaxing the rule as to compound words. The meaning of the last two terms, mârik and khûr<i>d</i>ak, is doubtful, but they are certainly not syllables and letters, as the number of syllables exceeds 13,000. In other places (see Bund. I, 21) mârik usually means 'a word,' but that meaning is expressed by the term vâ<i>k</i>ak here. If the number 9999 be correct, mârîk must signify some particular class of syllable which would include about three-fourths of the whole number of syllables. It may be noted, however, that Zâ<i>d</i>-sparam, in the particulars he gives about the Gâthas (see SZS. XI, 10, note 6), states the number of mârîk at 6666. The khûr<i>d</i>ak or 'small' things are probably the consonants.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1837"></a><a href="sbe0573.htm#fr_1849">369:1</a> All MSS. have 'four,' and then add the exception about Ithâ-i to the account of this Gâtha, instead of mentioning it in the details of the Vahi<i>s</i>tôi<i>s</i>ti; which blunder is here corrected.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1838"></a><a href="sbe0573.htm#fr_1850">369:2</a> Reading kadmon yehevûni<i>s</i>nŏ, but the latter word, with part of the ciphers which follow, is torn away in K20, and in M6 it is written so as to resemble the Avesta letters gnn gnn, which are unintelligible, though something like Pahl. yehevûni<i>s</i>nŏ; there can, however, be little doubt as to the general meaning of the phrase.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1839"></a><a href="sbe0573.htm#fr_1851">369:3</a> The number of lines is easily computed from the same details, as follows:300 + 120 + 329 + 164 + 66 + 37 = 1016 lines, as stated in § 50, and as they still exist in the Gâtha texts.</p>
