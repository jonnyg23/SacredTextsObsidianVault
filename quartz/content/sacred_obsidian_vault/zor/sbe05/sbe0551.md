 <p>1. And as he (Aharman) came thirdly to the earth, which arrayed the whole earth against him</p>  
 <p><a name="page_174"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 174</font></a></p>  
 <p>since <i>there was</i> an animation of the earth through the shatteringAlbûr<i>z</i> grew up <a name="fr_981"></a><a href="#fn_975"><font size="1">1</font></a>, which is the boundary of the earth, <i>and</i> the other <a name="fr_982"></a><a href="#fn_976"><font size="1">2</font></a> mountains, which are amid the circuit of the earth, come up 2244 in number <a name="fr_983"></a><a href="#fn_977"><font size="1">3</font></a>. 2. And by them the earth <i>was</i> bound together and arranged, and on them <i>was</i> the sprouting and growth of plants, wherefrom <i>was</i> the nourishment of cattle, and therefrom was the great advantage of assistance to men.</p>  
 <p>3. Even so it is declared that before the coming of the destroyer to the creatures, for a thousand years the substance of mountains was created in the earthespecially as antagonism came on the earth, <i>and</i> settled on <i>it</i> with injury<i>and</i> it came up over the earth just like a tree <i>whose</i> branch <i>has</i> grown at the top, and its root at the bottom. 4. The root of the mountains is passed on <i>from</i> one to the other, <i>and</i> is arranged in connection <i>with them</i>, and through it is produced the path <i>and</i> passage of water <i>from</i> below to above, so that the water may flow in it in such manner as blood in the veins, from all <i>parts</i> of the body to the heart, the latent vigour which they possess. 5. And, moreover, in six hundred years <a name="fr_984"></a><a href="#fn_978"><font size="1">4</font></a>, at first, all the mountains apart from Albûr<i>z</i> were completed. 6. Albûr<i>z</i> was growing during eight hundred years <a name="fr_985"></a><a href="#fn_979"><font size="1">5</font></a>; in two hundred years it grew up to</p>  
 <p>

 <p>the star station, in two hundred years up to the moon station, two hundred years up to the sun station, <i>and</i> two hundred years up to the sky. 7. After Albûr<i>z</i> the Aparsên mountain <a name="fr_986"></a><a href="#fn_980"><font size="1">1</font></a> is the greatest, as it is also called the Avar-rôyi<i>s</i>n <a name="fr_987"></a><a href="#fn_981"><font size="1">2</font></a> (up-growth') mountain, whose beginning is in Sagastân and its end unto Pârs and to <i>K</i>înîstân <a name="fr_988"></a><a href="#fn_982"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>8. This, too, is declared, that after the great rain in the beginning of the creation <a name="fr_989"></a><a href="#fn_983"><font size="1">4</font></a>, <i>and</i> the wind's sweeping away the water to the ocean, the earth is in seven portions <a name="fr_990"></a><a href="#fn_984"><font size="1">5</font></a>, a little above <i>it</i>, as the compact earth, after the rain, is torn up by the noise and wind <i>in</i> various places. 9. One portion, moreover, as much as one-half the whole earth, is in the middle, and in <i>each of</i> the six portions around is as much as Sagastân; moreover, as much as Sagastân is the measure <i>of what</i> is called a keshvar ('region') for the reason that one was defined from the other by a kêsh ('furrow'). 10. The middle <i>one</i> is Khvanîras, of which Pârs is the centre, and those six regions are like a coronet (a<i>v</i>îsar) <i>around it</i>. 11. One part of the wide-formed ocean wound around it, among those six regions; the sea and forest seized upon the south side, <i>and</i> a lofty mountain grew up on the north, so that they might become separate, one from the other, <i>and</i> imperceptible.</p>  
 <p>12. This is the third contest, about the earth.</p>
