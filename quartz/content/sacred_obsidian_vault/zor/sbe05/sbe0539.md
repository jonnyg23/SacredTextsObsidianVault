 <p>1. On the nature of the resurrection and future existence it says in revelation, that, whereas Mâshya and Mâshyôî, who grew up from the earth <a name="fr_682"></a><a href="#fn_677"><font size="1">7</font></a>, first fed upon water, then plants, then milk, <i>and</i> then meat, men also, when their time of death <i>has</i> come, first desist from eating meat, then milk, then from</p>

 <p>bread, till when <a name="fr_683"></a><a href="#fn_678"><font size="1">1</font></a> they shall die they always feed upon water. 2. So, likewise, in the millennium of Hûshê<i>d</i>ar-mâh <a name="fr_684"></a><a href="#fn_679"><font size="1">2</font></a>, the strength of appetite (âz) will thus diminish, when men <i>will</i> remain three days and nights in superabundance (sîrîh) through one taste of consecrated food. 3. Then they will desist from meat food, <i>and</i> eat vegetables <i>and</i> milk; afterwards, they abstain from milk food <i>and</i> abstain from vegetable food, <i>and</i> are feeding on water; <i>and</i> for ten years before Sôshyans <a name="fr_685"></a><a href="#fn_680"><font size="1">3</font></a> comes they remain without food, <i>and</i> do not die.</p>  
 <p>4. After Sôshyans <i>comes</i> they prepare the raising of the dead, as it says, that Zaratû<i>s</i>t asked of Aûharmazd thus: 'Whence does a body form again, which the wind <i>has</i> carried <i>and</i> the water conveyed (va<i>z</i>î<i>d</i>) <a name="fr_686"></a><a href="#fn_681"><font size="1">4</font></a>? <i>and</i> how does the resurrection occur?' 5. Aûharmazd answered thus: 'When through me the sky <i>arose</i> from the substance of the ruby <a name="fr_687"></a><a href="#fn_682"><font size="1">5</font></a>, without columns, on the spiritual support of far-compassed light; when through me the earth arose, which <a name="fr_688"></a><a href="#fn_683"><font size="1">6</font></a> bore the material life, <i>and</i> there is no</p>

 <p>maintainer of the worldly creation but it; when by me the sun <i>and</i> moon and stars are conducted in the firmament (andarvaî) of luminous bodies; when by me corn was created so that, scattered about in the earth, it grew again <i>and</i> returned with increase; when by me colour <a name="fr_689"></a><a href="#fn_684"><font size="1">1</font></a> of various kinds was created in plants; when by me fire was created in plants <i>and</i> other things <a name="fr_690"></a><a href="#fn_685"><font size="1">2</font></a> without combustion; when <i>by me</i> a son was created <i>and</i> fashioned <a name="fr_691"></a><a href="#fn_686"><font size="1">3</font></a> in the womb of a mother, <i>and</i> the structure (pî<i>s</i>ak) severally of the skin, nails, blood, feet, eyes, ears, and other things was produced; when by me legs were created for the water, so that it flows away, <i>and</i> the cloud was created which carries the water of the world <i>and</i> rains there where it has a purpose; when by me the air was created which conveys <i>in one's</i> eyesight, through the strength of the wind, the lowermost upwards according to <i>its</i> will, <i>and one</i> is not able to grasp it with the hand out-stretched; each one of them, when created by me, was herein more difficult than causing the resurrection, for <a name="fr_692"></a><a href="#fn_687"><font size="1">4</font></a> <i>it is</i> an assistance to me in the resurrection that they exist, <i>but</i> when they were formed it was not <i>forming</i> the future out of the past <a name="fr_693"></a><a href="#fn_688"><font size="1">5</font></a>. 6. Observe that when that which was not was then produced, why is it not possible to</p>

 <p>produce again that which was? for at that time <i>one will</i> demand the bone from the spirit of earth, the blood from the water, the hair from the plants, <i>and</i> the life from fire, since <i>they</i> were delivered to them in the original creation.'</p>  
 <p>7. First, the bones of Gâyômar<i>d</i> are roused up then those of Mâshya <i>and</i> Mâshyôî, then those of the rest of mankind; in the fifty-seven years <i>of</i> Sôshyans <a name="fr_694"></a><a href="#fn_689"><font size="1">1</font></a> they prepare all the dead, <i>and</i> all men stand up; whoever is righteous <i>and</i> whoever is wicked, every human creature, they rouse up from the spot where its life departs. 8. Afterwards, when all material living beings assume again their bodies <i>and</i> forms, then they assign (barâ yehabûnd) them a single class <a name="fr_695"></a><a href="#fn_690"><font size="1">2</font></a>. 9. Of the light accompanying (levatman) the sun, one half will <i>be</i> for Gâyômar<i>d</i>, and one half will give enlightenment among the rest of men, so that the soul <i>and</i> body will know that this is my father, and this is my mother, and this is my brother, and this is my wife, and these are some other of my nearest relations.</p>  
 <p>10. Then is the assembly of the, Sa<i>d</i>vâstarân <a name="fr_696"></a><a href="#fn_691"><font size="1">3</font></a> where all mankind will stand at this time; in that assembly every one sees his own good deeds and his own evil deeds; <i>and</i> then, in that assembly, a wicked <i>man</i> becomes as conspicuous as a white sheep among those which are black. 11. In that</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_124"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 124</font></a></p>  
 <p>assembly whatever righteous <i>man</i> was friend of a wicked <i>one</i> in the world, <i>and</i> the wicked <i>man</i> complains of him who is righteous, thus: 'Why did he not make me acquainted, when in the world, with the good deeds which he practised himself?' if he who is righteous did not inform him, then it is necessary for him to suffer shame accordingly in that assembly <a name="fr_697"></a><a href="#fn_692"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>12. Afterwards they set the righteous <i>man</i> apart from the wicked; <i>and</i> then the righteous is for heaven (garô<i>d</i>mân), and they cast the wicked back to hell. 13. Three days <i>and</i> nights they inflict punishment bodily in hell, <i>and</i> then he beholds bodily those three days' happiness in heaven <a name="fr_698"></a><a href="#fn_693"><font size="1">2</font></a>. 14. As it says that, on the day when the righteous <i>man</i> is parted from the wicked, the tears of every one, thereupon, run down unto <i>his</i> legs. 15. When, after they set apart a father from his consort (hambâ<i>z</i>), a brother from his brother, and a friend from</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_125"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 125</font></a></p>  
 <p>his friend, they suffer, every one for his own deeds, <i>and</i> weep, the righteous for the wicked, and the wicked about himself; for there may be a father who is righteous <i>and</i> a son wicked, <i>and</i> there may be one brother who is righteous <i>and</i> one wicked. 16. Those for whose peculiar deeds it is appointed, such as Dahâk and Frâsîyâ<i>v</i> of Tûr, <i>and</i> others of this sort, as those deserving death (marg-ar<i>g</i>ânân), undergo a punishment no other men undergo; they call <i>it</i> 'the punishment of the three nights <a name="fr_699"></a><a href="#fn_694"><font size="1">1</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>17. Among his producers of the renovation <i>of the universe</i>, those righteous men of whom it is written <a name="fr_700"></a><a href="#fn_695"><font size="1">2</font></a> that they are living, fifteen men and fifteen damsels, will come to the assistance of Sôshyans. 18. As Gô<i>k</i>îhar <a name="fr_701"></a><a href="#fn_696"><font size="1">3</font></a> falls in the <i>celestial</i> sphere from a moonbeam on to the earth, the distress of the earth becomes such-like as <i>that of</i> a sheep when a wolf falls <i>upon it</i>. 19. Afterwards, the fire and halo <a name="fr_702"></a><a href="#fn_697"><font size="1">4</font></a> melt the metal of Shatvaîrô, in the hills <i>and</i> mountains, <i>and</i> it remains on this earth like a river.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_126"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 126</font></a></p>  
 <p>20. Then all men will pass into that melted metal and will become pure; when <i>one</i> is righteous, then it seems to him just as though he walks continually in warm milk; <i>but</i> when wicked, then it seems to him in such manner as though, in the world, he walks continually in melted metal.</p>  
 <p>21. Afterwards, with the greatest affection, all men come together, father and son and brother and friend ask one another thus: 'Where has it <a name="fr_703"></a><a href="#fn_698"><font size="1">1</font></a> been these many years, and what was the judgment upon thy soul? hast thou been righteous or wicked?' 22. The first soul the body sees, it enquires of it with those words (gûft). 23. All men become of one voice <i>and</i> administer loud praise to Aûharmazd and the archangels.</p>  
 <p>24. Aûharmazd completes <i>his work</i> at that time, <i>and</i> the creatures become so that it is not necessary to make any effort about them; <i>and</i> among those by whom the dead are prepared, it is not necessary <i>that</i> any effort be made. 25. Sôshyans, with his assistants, performs a Ya<i>z</i>i<i>s</i>n <i>ceremony</i> in preparing the dead, <i>and</i> they slaughter the ox Hadhayôs <a name="fr_704"></a><a href="#fn_699"><font size="1">2</font></a> in that Ya<i>z</i>i<i>s</i>n; from the fat of that ox and the white Hôm <a name="fr_705"></a><a href="#fn_700"><font size="1">3</font></a> they prepare Hûsh, <i>and</i> give <i>it</i> to all men, and all men become immortal for ever <i>and</i> everlasting. 26. This, too, it says, that whoever has been the size of a man, they restore him then with an age of forty years; they who have been little when not dead, they restore then with an age of fifteen years; and they give every one <i>his</i> wife, and</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_127"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 127</font></a></p>  
 <p>show <i>him his</i> children with the wife; so they act as now in the world, but there is no begetting of children.</p>  
 <p>27. Afterwards, Sôshyans <i>and his assistants</i>, by order of the creator Aûharmazd, give every man the reward and recompense suitable to <i>his</i> deeds; this is even the righteous existence (aît) where it is said that they convey <i>him</i> to paradise (vahi<i>s</i>t), and the heaven (garô<i>d</i>mân) of Aûharmazd takes up the body (kerp) as itself requires; with that assistance he continually advances for ever <i>and</i> everlasting. 28. This, too, it says, that whoever has performed no worship (ya<i>s</i>t), and has ordered no Gêtî-kharî<i>d</i> <a name="fr_706"></a><a href="#fn_701"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and has bestowed no clothes as a righteous gift, is naked there; and he performs the worship (ya<i>s</i>t) of Aûharmazd, and the heavenly angels <a name="fr_707"></a><a href="#fn_702"><font size="1">2</font></a> provide him the use of his clothing.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_128"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 128</font></a></p>  
 <p>29. Afterwards, Aûharmazd seizes on <a name="fr_708"></a><a href="#fn_703"><font size="1">1</font></a> the evil spirit, Vohûman <i>on</i> Akôman <a name="fr_709"></a><a href="#fn_704"><font size="1">2</font></a>, Ashavahi<i>s</i>t <i>on</i> Andar <a name="fr_710"></a><a href="#fn_705"><font size="1">3</font></a>, Shatvaîrô <i>on</i> Sâvar, Spendarma<i>d</i> <i>on</i> Tarômat who is Nâûnghas <a name="fr_711"></a><a href="#fn_706"><font size="1">4</font></a>, Horvada<i>d</i> <i>and</i> Amerôda<i>d</i> <i>on</i> Tâîrê<i>v</i> <i>and</i> Zâîrî<i>k</i> <a name="fr_712"></a><a href="#fn_707"><font size="1">5</font></a>, true-speaking <i>on</i> what is evil-speaking, Srôsh <a name="fr_713"></a><a href="#fn_708"><font size="1">6</font></a> <i>on</i> Aeshm <a name="fr_714"></a><a href="#fn_709"><font size="1">7</font></a> 30. Then two fiends remain at large, Aharman <a name="fr_715"></a><a href="#fn_710"><font size="1">8</font></a> and Â<i>z</i> <a name="fr_716"></a><a href="#fn_711"><font size="1">9</font></a>; Aûharmazd comes to the world, himself the Zôta and Srôsh the Râspî <a name="fr_717"></a><a href="#fn_712"><font size="1">10</font></a>, and holds the Kûstî in <i>his</i> hand;</p>

Gô<i>k</i>îhar <a name="fr_720"></a><a href="#fn_715"><font size="1">3</font></a> burns the serpent (mâr) <a name="fr_721"></a><a href="#fn_716"><font size="1">4</font></a> in the melted metal, <i>and</i> the stench and pollution <i>which</i> were in hell are burned in that metal, <i>and</i> it (hell) becomes quite pure. 32. He (Aûharmazd) sets the vault <a name="fr_722"></a><a href="#fn_717"><font size="1">5</font></a> into which the evil spirit fled, in that metal; he brings the land of hell back for the enlargement of the world <a name="fr_723"></a><a href="#fn_718"><font size="1">6</font></a>; the renovation arises in the universe by <i>his</i> will, <i>and</i> the world is immortal for ever <i>and</i> everlasting.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_683"></a><a href="sbe0539.htm#fr_688">121:6</a> All MSS. have min, 'out of,' but translators generally suppose it should be mûn, 'which,' as the meaning of 'brought out of material life' is by no means clear. Perhaps the two phrases might be construed together, thus: 'there is no <i>other</i> maintainer of the worldly creation, brought from the material life, than it.' Windischmann refers to Fravardîn Yt. 9.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_684"></a><a href="sbe0539.htm#fr_689">122:1</a> Former translators all read rag, 'vein, pore;' but it probably stands for rang, 'colour, dye,' as in Chap. XXVII, 5, 18.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_690"></a><a href="sbe0539.htm#fr_695">123:2</a> The phrase is obscure, and K20 omits the numeral 'one' (the idhâfat of unity); but the meaning is probably that all former distinctions of class, or caste, are abolished.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_691"></a><a href="sbe0539.htm#fr_696">123:3</a> Windischmann suggests that it may be 'the assembly of Isa<i>d</i>vâstar,' the eldest son of Zaratû<i>s</i>t (see Chap. XXXII, 5); perhaps supposed to be presided over by him as the first supreme high-priest after Zaratû<i>s</i>t's death.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_692"></a><a href="sbe0539.htm#fr_697">124:1</a> In the Ar<i>d</i>â-Vîrâf-namak (Chap. LXVIII) it is related that Ar<i>d</i>â-Vîrâf saw the souls of a husband and wife, that of the husband destined for heaven, and that of the wife for hell; but the wife clung to her husband and asked why they should be separated, and he told her it was on account of her neglect of religious duties; whereupon she reproached him for not teaching and chastising her. 'And, afterwards, the man went to heaven and the woman to hell. And owing to the repentance of that woman she was in no other affliction in hell but darkness and stench. And that man sat in the midst of the righteous of heaven in shame, from not converting and not teaching the woman, who might have become virtuous in his keeping.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_693"></a><a href="sbe0539.htm#fr_698">124:2</a> As an aggravation of his punishment in hell. It has generally been supposed that this last phrase refers to the reward of the righteous man, but this cannot be the case unless akhar be taken in the sense of 'other,' which is unlikely; besides, beholding the happiness of others would be no reward to an Oriental mind.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_694"></a><a href="sbe0539.htm#fr_699">125:1</a> According to the Pahlavi Vend. VII, 136 (p. 96, Sp.) it appears that a person who has committed a marg-ar<i>g</i>ân or mortal sin, without performing patît or renunciation of sin thereafter, remains in hell till the future existence, when he is brought out, beheaded three times for each mortal sin unrepented of, and then cast back into hell to undergo the punishment tishrãm khshafnãm ('of the three nights') before he becomes righteous; some say, however, that this punishment is not inflicted for a single mortal sin. This period of three nights punishment is quite a different matter from the three nights hovering of the soul about the body after death.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_695"></a><a href="sbe0539.htm#fr_700">125:2</a> See Chap. XXIX, 5, 6. As the text stands in the MSS. it is uncertain whether the fifteen men and fifteen damsels are a portion of these righteous immortals, or an addition to them.</p>

The Rivâyat of Dastûr Barzû (as quoted in MS. 29 of Bombay University Parsi Collection) gives the following details in Persian: 'To celebrate Gêtî-kharî<i>d</i> it is necessary that two hêrbads (priests) perform the Nâbar, and with each khshnûman which they pray it is fit and necessary that both hêrbads have had the Nâbar; and the first day they recite the Nônâbar ya<i>s</i>t, and consecrate the Nônâbar drôn and the Nônâbar âfrîngân which they recite in each Gâh; in the Hâvan Gâh it is necessary to recite fravarânê (as in Yas.

The second day the Srôsh ya<i>s</i>t and Srôsh drôn and âfrîngân are to be recited; and the third day it is necessary to recite the Sîrôzah ya<i>s</i>t, the Sîrôzah drôn and âfrîngân dahmân; and it is needful to recite the second and third âfrîngâns in each Gâh, and each day to consecrate the barsom and drôn afresh with seven twigs, so that it may not be ineffective.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_702"></a><a href="sbe0539.htm#fr_707">127:2</a> Pâz. gehân is probably a misreading of Pahl. yazdân, as <a name="page_128"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 128</font></a> neither 'the spirit of the world,' nor 'the spirit of the Gâhs' is a likely phrase. It is possible, however, that maînôk gehân is a misreading of min aîvyahân, 'from the girdle,' and we should translate as follows: 'and out of its girdle (that is, the kûstî of the barsom used in the ceremony) he produces the effect of his clothing.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_703"></a><a href="sbe0539.htm#fr_708">128:1</a> Instead of vakhdûnd, 'seize on,' we should probably read vânend, 'smite,' as in the parallel passages mentioned below.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_704"></a><a href="sbe0539.htm#fr_709">128:2</a> Compare Zamyâd Yt. 96. Each archangel (see Chap. I, 25, 26) here seizes the arch-fiend (see Chaps. I, 27, XXVIII, 7-12) who is his special opponent.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_705"></a><a href="sbe0539.htm#fr_710">128:3</a> Here written Pâz. Inder. Compare Pahlavi Yas. XLVII, 1: 'When among the creation, in the future existence, righteousness smites the fiend, Ashavahi<i>s</i>t <i>smites</i> Indar.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_709"></a><a href="sbe0539.htm#fr_714">128:7</a> See Chap. XXVIII, 15-17.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_710"></a><a href="sbe0539.htm#fr_715">128:8</a> Comparing § 29 with § 30 it is not very clear whether the author of the Bundahi<i>s</i> considered Aharman and the evil spirit as the same or different demons; compare also Chap. XXVIII, 1-6 with 40, 41.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_711"></a><a href="sbe0539.htm#fr_716">128:9</a> See Chap. XXVIII, 27.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_712"></a><a href="sbe0539.htm#fr_717">128:10</a> The Zôta is the chief officiating priest in all ceremonies, and the Râspî is the assistant priest.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_713"></a><a href="sbe0539.htm#fr_718">129:1</a> The words zak g,hâni, for ân g<i>e</i>hâni, are probably a misreading of aîvyahân, 'the kûstî or sacred thread-girdle,' which is tied round the waist in a peculiar manner, during the recital of a particular formula, in which Aûharmazd is blessed and Aharman and the demons are cursed.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_714"></a><a href="sbe0539.htm#fr_719">129:2</a> See Chap. III, 10-12.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_716"></a><a href="sbe0539.htm#fr_721">129:4</a> Probably referring to Â<i>z</i>, which means both 'greediness' and 'serpent.' It is, however, possible to read 'Gô<i>k</i>îhar the serpent burns in' &amp;c., and there can be no doubt that Gô<i>k</i>îhar is represented as a malevolent being.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_717"></a><a href="sbe0539.htm#fr_722">129:5</a> Or, perhaps, 'hiding-place.' Comparing K20 and M6 together the word seems to be alôm, which may be compared with Heb. ‏אוּלָם‎ 'a vault,' or Chald. ‏אוּלָמָא‎ 'a porch;' it may, however, be vâlôm, which may be traced to ‏עלם‎ 'to conceal.' In the old MSS. it is certainly not shôlman, 'hell,' which is an emendation due to the modern copy in Paris.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_719"></a><a href="sbe0539.htm#fr_724">129:7</a> Former translators read anhîkhar, 'undefiled,' but this does not suit the Pahlavi orthography so well as anhasâr, 'iceless' (compare Pers. hasar, khâsar, or khasâr, 'ice'); cold and ice, being produced by the evil spirit, will disappear with him.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_720"></a><a href="sbe0539.htm#fr_725">129:8</a> Pâz. âmâvan is a misreading of Pahl. hâmûn, so the reading is an<i>s</i>îp (compare Pers. <i>s</i>îb) hâmûn. Mountains, being the work of the evil spirit, disappear with him.</p>
