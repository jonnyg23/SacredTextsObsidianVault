 <p>1. The Yathâ-ahû-vairyô <a name="fr_1923"></a><a href="#fn_1911"><font size="1">1</font></a> <i>formulas</i> that are necessary in each place, and how <i>they</i> are to be spoken in performing anything <a name="fr_1924"></a><a href="#fn_1912"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>2. One <i>by him</i> who goes forth to an assembly, or before grandees <i>and</i> chieftains, or on any business; or when he goes to ask for what he wants (val khvahî<i>s</i>nŏ); also when he quits any business; in each of these situations <i>he</i> is to say only one <i>formula</i>, so that his business may proceed more promptly <a name="fr_1925"></a><a href="#fn_1913"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>

 <p>3. <i>That</i> a blessing (âfrînô) may be more benedictory, for this <i>reason one</i> utters two <i>formulas</i>; for <i>there</i> are two kinds of blessing, one is that which is in the thoughts <a name="fr_1926"></a><a href="#fn_1914"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and one is that which is in words.</p>  
 <p>4. Four are for coming out more thankfully when at a season-festival <a name="fr_1927"></a><a href="#fn_1915"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>5. Five <i>by him</i> who goes to atone for sin, in order to expel the fiend; because it is necessary to undergo punishment by the decision (dastôbarîh) of these five persons, the house-ruler, the village-ruler, <i>the tribe-ruler</i> <a name="fr_1928"></a><a href="#fn_1916"><font size="1">3</font></a>, the province-ruler, and the supreme Zaratû<i>s</i>t; and five Ashem-vohûs <a name="fr_1929"></a><a href="#fn_1917"><font size="1">4</font></a> are to be uttered by him at the end.</p>  
 <p>6. Six <i>by him</i> who goes to seek power, and to battle, so that he may be more successful.</p>

 <p>7. Seven <i>by him</i> who goes to perform the worship of God (yazdân), <i>so that</i> the archangels may come more forward <a name="fr_1930"></a><a href="#fn_1918"><font size="1">1</font></a> at the worship.</p>  
 <p>8. Eight <i>by him</i> who goes to perform the ceremonial of the righteous guardian spirit.</p>  
 <p>9. Nine <i>by him</i> who goes to sow corn; these he utters for this <i>reason</i>, because the corn will ripen (rasê<i>d</i>) in nine months, <i>and</i> so that the corn may come forward he will make the mischief of the noxious creatures less <a name="fr_1931"></a><a href="#fn_1919"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>10. Ten <i>by him</i> who goes to seek a wife, so that the presents may be favourable for the purpose. 11. Ten <i>by him</i> who wishes to allow the male <i>access</i> to beasts <i>of burden</i> and cattle, so that it may be more procreative <a name="fr_1932"></a><a href="#fn_1920"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>12. Eleven <i>by him</i> who goes to the lofty mountains, so that the glory of mountains and hills may bless him <i>and</i> be friendly <a name="fr_1933"></a><a href="#fn_1921"><font size="1">4</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>13. Twelve <i>by him</i> who goes to the low districts, so that the glory of that country and district may bless him and be friendly <a name="fr_1934"></a><a href="#fn_1922"><font size="1">5</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>14. Thirteen <i>by him</i> who shall become pathless; <i>at</i> that same place he shall utter <i>them</i>; or <i>by him</i></p>  
 <p>
 </p>

 <p><a name="page_393"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 393</font></a></p>  
 <p>who shall pass over a bridge and a river, so that the spirit of that water may bless him <a name="fr_1935"></a><a href="#fn_1923"><font size="1">1</font></a>; because the Yathâ-ahû-vairyô is greater and more successful <i>than</i> everything in the Avesta as to all rivers, all wholesomeness, and all protection.</p>  
 <p>15. Religion is as connected with the Yathâ-ahû-vairyô as the hair is more connected with the glory of the face; any one, indeed, would dread (samâ<i>d</i>) to separate hairiness <i>and</i> the glory of the face.</p>

 <h3 align="CENTER">Footnotes</h3>
 <p><a name="fn_1911"></a><a href="sbe0579.htm#fr_1923">390:1</a> See Bund. I, 21.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1912"></a><a href="sbe0579.htm#fr_1924">390:2</a> It appears from the ninth book of the Dînkar<i>d</i>, that the contents of this chapter are derived from the first fargar<i>d</i> of the Sû<i>d</i>kar Nask (see B. Yt. I, 1, note). The account given by the Dînkar<i>d</i> contains fewer details, but, so far as it goes, it is in accordance with our text, except that it seems to transfer the object of § 10 to § 12, and removes the objects of §§ 12, 13 one step onwards; it also adds 'going on a bridge' to § 2. The Persian Rivâyat of Bahman Pûn<i>g</i>yah gives further details, as will be mentioned in the notes below.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1913"></a><a href="sbe0579.htm#fr_1925">390:3</a> The Persian Rivâyat adds to these occasions, when he goes on the water, or a river, or goes to borrow, or to ask repayment of a loan, or goes out from his house, or comes into it.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1914"></a><a href="sbe0579.htm#fr_1926">391:1</a> The words pavan mîni<i>s</i>n are guessed, for this first clause is omitted by mistake in M6, and these two words are illegible in K20, except part of the last letter.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1915"></a><a href="sbe0579.htm#fr_1927">391:2</a> K20 substitutes for val, 'at,' the following mutilated phrase [. . . . a<font size="-1">N</font>h<i>a</i>u khshapô ka<i>d</i>ar<i>k</i>âi pavan ka<i>d</i>âr<i>k</i>âî] madam vazlûnê<i>d</i> râ<i>d</i>ih-i; the portion in brackets being evidently a fragment from the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht Srôsh Yt. 5 with Pahlavi translation (a passage which treats of the efficacy of reciting the Yathâ-ahû-vairyô). If this fragment be not merely a marginal gloss, which has crept into the text by mistake, we must translate the whole section as follows: 'Four are for the more thankful coming out of the liberality of a season-festival, when the passage, "<i>on that day nor</i> on that night <i>comes there</i> anything whatever on any one," goes on.' The Dînkar<i>d</i> has merely: 'Four by <i>him</i> who is at the invocation of the chiefs <i>of creation and</i> the celebration of a season-festival.' The Persian Rivâyats omit the section altogether.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1916"></a><a href="sbe0579.htm#fr_1928">391:3</a> This person is omitted both in M6 and K20, but he is wanted to make up the five. This section is omitted by the Persian Rivâyats.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1917"></a><a href="sbe0579.htm#fr_1929">391:4</a> See Bund. XX, 2. These are to be recited after the punishment is over.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1918"></a><a href="sbe0579.htm#fr_1930">392:1</a> Or 'may arrive earlier;' there being seven archangels has suggested the number seven. This section and the next are omitted by the Persian Rivâyats.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1919"></a><a href="sbe0579.htm#fr_1931">392:2</a> The Persian Rivâyats add general cultivation, planting trees, and cohabitation with one's wife.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1920"></a><a href="sbe0579.htm#fr_1932">392:3</a> Instead of §§ 10, 11 the Persian Rivâyats have buying quadrupeds, and driving pegs into the ground for picketing them.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1921"></a><a href="sbe0579.htm#fr_1933">392:4</a> The Persian Rivâyats substitute conference with a maiden, seeking a wife, giving one's children in marriage, and obtaining anything from another.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1922"></a><a href="sbe0579.htm#fr_1934">392:5</a> The Persian Rivâyats add going up hills, mounting anything lofty, going on a bridge, and losing one's way.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1923"></a><a href="sbe0579.htm#fr_1935">393:1</a> The Persian Rivâyats substitute going to and entering a city or town; they also add twenty-one recitations on setting out on a journey, so that the angel Bahrâm may grant a safe arrival.</p>
