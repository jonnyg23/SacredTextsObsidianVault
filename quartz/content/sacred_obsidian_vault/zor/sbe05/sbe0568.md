 <p>1. Sin which <i>affects</i> accusers <a name="fr_1513"></a><a href="#fn_1502"><font size="1">3</font></a> is to be atoned for (vi<i>g</i>âri<i>s</i>n) among the accusers, and that <i>relating</i> to</p>

 <p>the soul is to be atoned for among the high-priests (ra<i>d</i>ân), and when they do whatever the high-priests of the religion command the sin will depart, and the good works which they may thenceforth do will attain completion (avaspôrik). 2. The sin of him who is worthy of death (marg-ar<i>g</i>ân), is to be confessed (gar<i>z</i>i<i>s</i>nŏ) unto the high-priests, <i>and he</i> is to deliver up <i>his</i> body <a name="fr_1514"></a><a href="#fn_1503"><font size="1">1</font></a>; except <i>to</i> the high-priests he is not to deliver up <i>his</i> body.</p>  
 <p>3. On account of the dexterity (farhâng) of horsemen it is not <i>their</i> business to hunt (nakh<i>k</i>îr kar<i>d</i>anŏ); and it is not allowable for any one else to hunt for game, except <i>for him</i> whose wealth is less <i>than</i> three hundred stîrs <a name="fr_1515"></a><a href="#fn_1504"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>

 <p>4. The ceremonial worship (ya<i>z</i>i<i>s</i>n) of those worthy of death, which they do not perform by way of renunciation <i>of sin</i> <a name="fr_1516"></a><a href="#fn_1505"><font size="1">1</font></a>, is the ceremonial <i>which</i> is demon worship; and when the <i>officiating</i> priest (aêrpat) does not know <i>it</i> the merit (kirfak) of the ceremonial goes to the store (gan<i>g</i>) of the angels, and they give the enjoyment which <i>arises</i> from that merit in the spiritual <i>existence</i> to the soul of that person who <i>has</i> at once (aêvâ<i>k</i>) become righteous in mind.</p>  
 <p>5 . When the mortal sinner (marg-ar<i>g</i>ânŏ) <i>has</i> delivered his body and wealth at once to the high-priests, and engages mentally in renunciation as to the sin which <i>has</i> occurred, and the high-priests give him <i>their</i> decision (dastôbarîh) as to duty and good works, the duty and good works which <i>were</i> before performed by him come back <i>to him</i>; and when they inflict punishment for three nights <a name="fr_1517"></a><a href="#fn_1506"><font size="1">2</font></a>, he does not enter hell. 6. And if the high-priest orders the cutting off of <i>his</i> head <i>he</i> is righteous on the spot <a name="fr_1518"></a><a href="#fn_1507"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and the three <i>nights</i> (satûîh) <i>ceremony</i> is to be celebrated for <i>him</i>, and the account of the</p>

 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_303"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 303</font></a></p>  
 <p>three <i>nights</i> (satûîh) does not affect him <a name="fr_1519"></a><a href="#fn_1508"><font size="1">1</font></a>. 7. And if <i>he does</i> not <i>engage</i> in renunciation <i>he is</i> in hell till the future existence; and in <i>his</i> future body they will bring <i>him</i> from hell, and for every mortal <i>sin</i> they will cut off <i>his</i> head once, and the last time they <i>will</i> make <i>him</i> alive again, and will inflict (numâyend) three nights severe punishment <a name="fr_1520"></a><a href="#fn_1509"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>8. However a man engages in renunciation of sin the duty of his state of renunciation (patîtîh) is to be engaged therein openly and mentally in renunciation; the duty of openness is this, that the sin which he knows <i>has</i> assailed him <a name="fr_1521"></a><a href="#fn_1510"><font size="1">3</font></a>, is to be specially confessed (barâ gôbi<i>s</i>nŏ) by him; <i>and</i> the mental duty is this, that he engages in renunciation with this thought, that 'henceforth I <i>will</i> not commit sin.' 9. And that which occurs before the renunciation, except pious alms, it is well for him not to be overlooked <a name="fr_1522"></a><a href="#fn_1511"><font size="1">4</font></a> by him, <i>and</i> not to be kept <a name="fr_1523"></a><a href="#fn_1512"><font size="1">5</font></a> secret by him; for when he shall overlook <a name="fr_1524"></a><a href="#fn_1513"><font size="1">6</font></a>, or shall keep secret, about sin committed, it becomes for him as</p>

 <p>much, some say, as three Srôshô-<i>k</i>aranâms <a name="fr_1525"></a><a href="#fn_1514"><font size="1">1</font></a>; some say that when he keeps secret about a sin of three Srôshô-<i>k</i>aranâms he is worthy of death; some say much otherwise <a name="fr_1526"></a><a href="#fn_1515"><font size="1">2</font></a>. 10. Âtarô-pâ<i>d</i> son of Zaratû<i>s</i>t <a name="fr_1527"></a><a href="#fn_1516"><font size="1">3</font></a> had remarked (pe<i>d</i>âkînî<i>d</i>) <i>to</i> a disciple, about this duty, thus: 'Conform to the renunciation <i>of sin!</i>' and one <a name="fr_1528"></a><a href="#fn_1517"><font size="1">4</font></a> time a secret was kept by him, and he ordered him thus: 'Henceforth be thou never apparent in this duty!' and after that he looked upon the supplication (avakhshîh) and much repentance of that disciple, and even then he did not become the high-priest (dastôbar) over him.</p>  
 <p>11. <i>The rule is</i> <a name="fr_1529"></a><a href="#fn_1518"><font size="1">5</font></a> this, that <i>of those</i> who would be proper for this priestly duty (dastôbarîh), that person is proper who is perfect in (narm) the commentary (<i>z</i>and) of the law, and the punishment of sin is easy for him, and he has controlled himself; some say thus: 'By whom a course of priestly studies (aêrpatastân) is performed.' 12. And the punishment of sin <i>being</i> easy for him, and his <i>having</i> controlled himself are proper; and when, in danger before a menstruous woman, he engages in renunciation it is proper.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1502"></a><a href="sbe0568.htm#fr_1513">300:3</a> Vinâs-i hamêmâlân, 'sin relating to adversaries.' Sins appear to be divided into two great classes, hamêmâl and rûbânîk. A hamêmâl sin seems to be any secular offence which injures some person or animal who, thereupon, becomes a hamêmâl, 'accuser' (Av. hameretha, 'opponent,' Yas. LVI, X, 10), and who must first be satisfied by atonement, before confession to the high-priest, or renunciation of sin, can be of any avail for removing the sin (compare Matthew V. 23-26). The Rivâyats assert that if a person dies without atoning for a hamêmâl sin, his soul will be stopped at the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge (see Bund. XII, 7) on its way to the other world, and kept in a state of torment until the arrival of the 'accuser,' and after he is satisfied the sinner's soul will be disposed of, in the usual manner, according to the balance of its good and bad actions. It is also probable that only a man of 'the good religion,' or an animal of the good creation, can be an 'accuser.' A rûbânîk sin, on the other hand, seems to be one which affects only the sinner's own soul, and for which the high-priest can prescribe a sufficient atonement. It is doubtful, however, whether the Parsis nowadays have any very clear notions of the exact distinction between these two classes of sins, although aware of their names, which are mentioned in their Patit, or renunciation of sin. The explanations given in some editions of their Khurdah Avesta, or prayer-book, are confined to mentioning certain special instances of each class of sin; thus, <a name="page_301"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 301</font></a> murder, seduction, unnecessary slaughter of cattle, embezzlement, slander, seizing land by force, and a few other evil deeds are stated to be hamêmâl sins; while unnatural offences and intercourse with women of another race and religion are said to be rûbânîk sins. In the Pahlavi Vendidad these classes of sins are rarely mentioned, but hamêmâlân occurs in Pahl. Vend. III, 151, IV, 23, XIII, 38; hamêmâlîh in III, 119; and rûbânîk in XIII, 38; although, perhaps, not always in the sense of sin.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1503"></a><a href="sbe0568.htm#fr_1514">301:1</a> By committing a marg-ar<i>g</i>ân or mortal sin, that is, a sin worthy of death, he has forfeited his life, and ought to place it at the disposal of the ra<i>d</i>, or high-priest.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1504"></a><a href="sbe0568.htm#fr_1515">301:2</a> This section, intended to preserve game for the poor, is evidently out of place here, as it has no connection with the context. With reference to the property qualification for hunting, it appears, from a passage in the Persian MS. M5 about the proper dowry for a privileged wife, that 2000 dirhams of silver were worth 2300 rûpîs, and that 2 dirhams were 2¼ tolas; this was written in A.D. 1723, when neither the rûpî nor the tola were of uniform amount, though now the rûpî is exactly a tola weight of silver. As the stîr was four dirhams (see Chap. I, 2), three hundred stîrs would have been 1380 rûpîs or 1350 tolas of silver, according to the standards, mentioned in M5; so that hunting was intended to be confined to those whose property was less than 1350-1380 rûpîs; but how <a name="page_301"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 301</font></a> this limitation is to be reconciled with the fact that hunting was a favourite pursuit of kings and nobles does not appear, unless it be considered as a sacerdotal protest against that practice.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1505"></a><a href="sbe0568.htm#fr_1516">302:1</a> That is, in those cases when they do not have the ya<i>z</i>i<i>s</i>n performed as an atonement for sin, by order of the high-priest after confession.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1506"></a><a href="sbe0568.htm#fr_1517">302:2</a> This appears to refer to temporal punishment, inflicted by order of the high-priest, for the purpose of saving him from the 'punishment of the three nights' in the other world, mentioned in Bund. XXX, 16.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1507"></a><a href="sbe0568.htm#fr_1518">302:3</a> Reading pavan <i>g</i>înâk; but M6 marks the phrase as pavan dînâk (for dînâ), 'through the decree,' which is probably an error.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1508"></a><a href="sbe0568.htm#fr_1519">303:1</a> That is, the usual ceremonies after death are not to be withheld in this world, and his soul is able to pass through the usual investigation, as to his sins and good works, on its way to the other world, without delay. This period of three nights (satûîh, 'the triplet'), which Pâzand writers miscall sedô<i>s</i> or sadis, is the time during which the soul is supposed to hover about the body, before finally departing for the other world (see Mkh. II, 114, 158-160, AV. IV, 9-14, XVII, 2-9).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1509"></a><a href="sbe0568.htm#fr_1520">303:2</a> The same statement is made in nearly the same words in Pahl. Vend. VII, 136. This is the future three nights punishment for impenitent sinners, mentioned in Bund. XXX, 16.</p>
