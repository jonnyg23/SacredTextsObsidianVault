 <p>1. On the nature of the earth it says in revelation, that <i>there</i> are thirty and three kinds <a name="fr_153"></a><a href="#fn_153"><font size="1">3</font></a> of land. 2. <i>On</i> the day when Tî<i>s</i>tar produced the rain, when its seas arose therefrom, the whole place, half taken up by water, was converted into seven portions; this portion <a name="fr_154"></a><a href="#fn_154"><font size="1">4</font></a>, as much as one-half, is the middle, <i>and</i> six portions are around; those six portions are <i>together</i> as much as Khvanîras. 3. The name</p>

 <p>kêshvar ('zone or region') is also applied to them, and <i>they</i> existed side by side (kash kash) <a name="fr_155"></a><a href="#fn_155"><font size="1">1</font></a>; as on the east side of this portion (Khvanîras) is the Savah region, <i>on</i> the west is the Arzah region; the two portions on the south side are the Frada<i>d</i>afsh <i>and</i> Vîda<i>d</i>afsh regions, the two portions on the north side are the Vôrûbar<i>s</i>t <i>and</i> Vôrû<i>g</i>ar<i>s</i>t regions, <i>and</i> that in the middle is Khvanîras. 4. And Khvanîras has the sea, for one part of the wide-formed ocean wound about around it; <i>and from</i> Vôrûbar<i>s</i>t <i>and</i> Vôrû<i>g</i>ar<i>s</i>t a lofty mountain grew up; so that it is not possible for any one to go from region to region <a name="fr_156"></a><a href="#fn_156"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>5. And of these seven regions every benefit was created most in Khvanîras, and the evil spirit also produced most for Khvanîras, on account of the superiority (sarîh) <a name="fr_157"></a><a href="#fn_157"><font size="1">3</font></a> which he saw in it. 6. For the Kayânians and heroes were created in Khvanîras; and the good religion of the Mazdayasnians was created in Khvanîras, and afterwards conveyed to the other regions; Sôshyans <a name="fr_158"></a><a href="#fn_158"><font size="1">4</font></a> is born in Khvanîras, who makes the evil spirit impotent, and causes the resurrection <i>and</i> future existence.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_153"></a><a href="sbe0520.htm#fr_153">32:3</a> K20b has 'thirty-two kinds.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_154"></a><a href="sbe0520.htm#fr_154">32:4</a> That is, Khvanîras; or it may be 'one portion,' as hanâ, 'this,' is often used for aê, 'one,' because the Pâzand form of both words is <i>e</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_155"></a><a href="sbe0520.htm#fr_155">33:1</a> Possibly an attempt to connect the term kêshvar with kash; but the sentence may also be translated thus: 'and <i>they</i> formed various districts like this portion; on the east side is the Savah region,' &amp;c.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_156"></a><a href="sbe0520.htm#fr_156">33:2</a> In the Pahlavi Vend. I, 4a, and in the Mainyô-i-khar<i>d</i>, IX, 6, it is added, 'except with the permission of the angels' or the demons.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_157"></a><a href="sbe0520.htm#fr_157">33:3</a> So in M6; but K20 has za<i>d</i>ârîh, which would imply, 'for the destruction of what he saw of it.'</p>
