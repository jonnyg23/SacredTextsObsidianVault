 <p>3. Aûharmazd spoke <a name="fr_1057"></a><a href="#fn_1050"><font size="1">4</font></a> thus: 'When I shall make thee immortal, O Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtâmân! then Tûr-i Brâ<i>d</i>arvash the Karap <a name="fr_1058"></a><a href="#fn_1051"><font size="1">5</font></a> will become immortal, and</p>

And he, Aûharmazd the propitious spirit, creator of the material world, the righteous <i>one</i>, even he put the omniscient wisdom, in the shape of water, on the hand of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, and said to him thus: 'Devour it.'</p>

 <p>6. And Zaratû<i>s</i>t devoured <i>some</i> of it; thereby the omniscient wisdom was intermingled with Zaratû<i>s</i>t, and seven days and nights Zaratû<i>s</i>t was in the wisdom of Aûharmazd. 7. And Zaratû<i>s</i>t beheld the men and cattle in the seven regions of the earth, where the many fibres of hair of every one are, and whereunto the end of each fibre holds on the back. 8. And he beheld whatever trees and shrubs <i>there were</i>, and how many roots of plants were in the earth of Spendarma<i>d</i>, where <i>and</i> how they had grown, <i>and</i> where they were mingled.</p>  
 <p>9. And the seventh day and night he (Aûharmazd) took back the omniscient wisdom from Zaratû<i>s</i>t, and Zaratû<i>s</i>t reflected in this <i>way</i>, that I have seen <i>it</i> in a pleasant dream produced by Aûharmazd, <i>and</i> I am not surfeited with the dream. 10. And he took both hands, rubbed his body (kerp) again, <i>and spoke</i> <a name="fr_1061"></a><a href="#fn_1054"><font size="1">1</font></a> thus: 'I have slept a long time, and am not surfeited with this pleasant dream produced by Aûharmazd.'</p>  
 <p>11. Aûharmazd said to the righteous Zaratû<i>s</i>t thus: 'What was seen in the pleasant dream produced by Aûharmazd?'</p>  
 <p>12. Zaratû<i>s</i>t spoke thus: 'O Aûharmazd, propitious spirit! creator of the material world, righteous creator! I have seen a celebrity (khunî<i>d</i>) with much wealth, whose soul, infamous in the body, was hungry (gurs) <a name="fr_1062"></a><a href="#fn_1055"><font size="1">2</font></a> and jaundiced and in hell, and he did not seem to me exalted; and I saw a beggar with no wealth and helpless, and his soul was thriving (farpîh) in paradise, and <a name="fr_1063"></a><a href="#fn_1056"><font size="1">3</font></a> he seemed to me exalted.</p>

 <p>15. Aûharmazd spoke thus: 'O Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtâmân! this is what I say beforehand, the one tree which thou sawest is the world which I, Aûharmazd, created; and those seven branches thou sawest are the seven periods which <i>will</i> come. 16.

 <p><a name="fn_1047"></a><a href="sbe0558.htm#fr_1054">195:1</a> Or, 'when I shall <i>become</i>;' the verb is omitted by mistake in K20.</p>

(Reply 89). The tale of Gô<i>s</i>t-i Fryân (Av. Yôi<i>s</i>tô yô Fryananãm, of Âbân Yt. 81 and Fravardîn Yt. 120) has been published with The Book of Ar<i>d</i>â-Vîrâf,' ed. Hoshangji and Haug.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1049"></a><a href="sbe0558.htm#fr_1056">195:3</a> Or, 'became;' most of this verb is torn off in K20.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1050"></a><a href="sbe0558.htm#fr_1057">195:4</a> The verb is placed before its nominative in the Pahlavi text, both here and in most similar sentences, which is an imitation of the Avesta, due probably to the text being originally translated from an Avesta book now lost, or, at any rate, to its author's wish that it might appear to be so translated. In such cases of inverted construction, when the verb is in a past tense, the Pahlavi idiom often requires a pronominal suffix, corresponding, to the nominative, to be added to the first word in the sentence; thus, gûftŏ<i>s</i> Aûharmazd, or afa<i>s</i> gûft Aûharmazd, does not mean 'Aûharmazd spoke to him (or said it),' but merely 'Aûharmazd spoke' (lit. 'it was said by him, Aûharmazd').</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1051"></a><a href="sbe0558.htm#fr_1058">195:5</a> According to an untranslated passage in the Selections of Zâ<i>d</i>-sparam, mentioned in the note on <a href="sbe0555.htm#page_187">p. 187</a>, this is the name of <a name="page_196"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 196</font></a> one of the five brothers in the Karapân family of sorcerers, who were enemies of Zaratû<i>s</i>t during his childhood. Their names, as written in SZS., may be read as follows, 'Brâ<i>d</i>arvakhsh, Brâ<i>d</i>rôyi<i>s</i>nŏ, Tûr Brâgrêsh, Azânŏ, and Nasm,' and the first is also called 'Tûr-i 'Brâ<i>d</i>arvakhsh;' they are described as descendants of the sister of Manû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar. In the seventh book of the Dînka<i>r</i>d a wizard, who endeavours to injure Zaratû<i>s</i>t in his childhood, is called 'Tûr-i Brâ<i>d</i>rôk-rêsh, the Karapŏ,' and was probably the third brother, whose name (thus corrected) indicates brâthrô-raêsha as its Avesta form. Karap or Karapân in all these passages is evidently the name of a family or caste, probably the Av. karapanô which Haug translates by 'performers of (idolatrous) sacrificial rites,' in connection with Sans. kalpa, 'ceremonial ritual' (see Haug's Essays, pp. 289-291).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1052"></a><a href="sbe0558.htm#fr_1059">196:1</a> K20 has 'among the spirits;' the word mîni<i>s</i>n having become maînôkân by the insertion of an extra stroke.</p>

The copyist of K20 was evidently not aware that afa<i>s</i> is a conjunctive form, but confounded it with the prepositional form a<i>g</i>a<i>s</i>, as most Parsis and some European scholars do still. The Sasanian inscriptions confirm the reading afa<i>s</i> for the conjunctive form; and Nêryôsang, the learned Parsi translator of Pahlavi texts into Pâzand and Sanskrit some four centuries ago, was aware of the difference between the two forms, as he transcribes them correctly into Paz. va<i>s</i> and a<i>z</i>a<i>s</i>.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1068"></a><a href="sbe0558.htm#fr_1075">199:7</a> It is uncertain which of the A<i>s</i>kânian sovereigns is meant, or whether several of the dynasty may not be referred to. The Greek <a name="page_200"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 200</font></a> successors of Alexander were subdued in Persia by A<i>s</i>k (Arsaces I), who defeated Seleucus Callinicus about B.C. 236. But the third book of the Dînkar<i>d</i> (in a passage quoted by Haug in his Essay on the Pahlavi Language) mentions Valkha<i>s</i> (Vologeses) the A<i>s</i>kânian as collecting the Avesta and Zand, and encouraging the Mazdayasnian religion. This Valkha<i>s</i> was probably Vologeses I, a contemporary of Nero, as shown by Darmesteter in the introduction to his translation of the Vendidad.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1069"></a><a href="sbe0558.htm#fr_1076">200:1</a> I am indebted to Professor J. Darmesteter for pointing out that Nêryôsang, in his Sanskrit translation of Yas. IX, 75, explains Kala<i>s</i>iyâkâ<i>h</i> as 'those whose faith is the Christian religion;' the original Pahlavi word in the oldest MSS. is Kilisâyâîk, altogether a misunderstanding of the Avesta name Keresâni, which it translates, but sufficiently near the name in our text to warrant the assumption that Nêryôsang would have translated Kilisyâkîh by 'Christianity;' literally it means 'ecclesiasticism, or the church religion' (from Pers. kilisyâ, Gr. ἐκκλησία). Akandgar is probably a miswriting of Alaksandar or Sikandar; though Darmesteter suggests that Skandgar (Av. ske<i>n</i>dô-kara, Pers. <i>s</i>ikandgar), 'causer of destruction,' would be an appropriate punning title for Alexander from a Persian point of view. The anachronisms involved in making Alexander the Great a Christian, conquered by an A<i>s</i>kânian king, are not more startling than the usual Pahlavi statement that he was a Roman. To a Persian in Sasanian times Alexander was the representative of an invading enemy which had come from the countries occupied, in those times, by the eastern empire of the Christian Romans, which enemy had been subdued in Persia by the A<i>s</i>kânian dynasty; and such information would naturally lead to the anachronisms just mentioned. The name Kilisyâkîh is again used, in Chap. III, 3, 5, 8, to denote some Christian enemy.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1070"></a><a href="sbe0558.htm#fr_1077">200:2</a> This Sasanian monarch (A.D. 420-439), after considerable provocation, revived the persecution of the heretics and foreign creeds which had been tolerated by his predecessor, and this conduct naturally endeared him to the priesthood.</p>

His doctrine appears to have been extreme socialism built upon a Mazdayasnian foundation. He was put to death by Khûsrô I, as hinted in the text. It is remarkable that none of the successors of Khûsrô Nôshirvân are mentioned in the Bahman Ya<i>s</i>t, so that a Parsi, who even did not believe in the verbal inspiration of the book, might possibly consider the remainder of it as strictly prophetical.</p>

In fact, hardly any of the numerous details which follow, except their long-continued rule, apply exclusively to Muhammadans. It appears, moreover, from § 50 and Chap.

 <p><a name="fn_1087"></a><a href="sbe0558.htm#fr_1094">205:2</a> According to Dastûr Hoshangji (Zand-Pahlavi Glossary, p. 65) the term magh is now applied to the stones on which the person undergoing purification has to squat during ablution in the barashnûm ceremony. Originally, however, Av. magha appears to have meant a shallow hole dug in the earth, near or over which the person squatted upon a seat, either of stone or some other hard material (see Vend. IX). The term for the hole was probably extended to the whole arrangement, including the seat, which latter has thus acquired the name of magh, although magh and maghâk still mean 'a channel or pit' in Persian.</p>

It should be large enough for standing upright, and for stretching out the feet and hands, without touching either walls or ceiling; that is, not less than six feet cube. The text means that those times will be so distressing, that it will be considered lawful to perform the sacred ceremonies even in a place of such concentrated impurity as a dead-house not actually occupied by a corpse.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1115"></a><a href="sbe0558.htm#fr_1122">212:5</a> For the following explanation of the various kinds of hômâst I am indebted to Dastûr Jâmâspji Minochiharji Jâmâsp-Âsâ-nâ of Bombay:</p>  
 <p>There are four kinds of hômâst recited by priests for the atonement of any sin that may have been committed by a woman during menstruation, after her purification:</p>  
 <p>1. Hômâst consists of prayers recited for 144 days, in honour of the twelve following angels: Aûharmazd, Tî<i>s</i>tar, Khûrshêd, Mâh, Âbân, Âdar, Khurdâd, Amerdâd, Spendarma<i>d</i>, Bâd, Srôsh, and Ardâ-fravash. Each angel, in turn, is reverenced for twelve days successively, with one Yasna each day.</p>  
 <p>2. Khadûk-hômâst, 'one hômâst,' differs from the last merely in adding a Vendidad every twelfth day, to be recited in the <a name="page_213"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 213</font></a> Ushahin Gâh (12 P<i>M</i>. to 6 A<i>M</i>.) in honour of the angel whose propitiation ends that day.</p>  
 <p>3. Dah-hômâst, 'ten hômâsts,' differs from the preceding merely in having a Vendidad, in addition to the Yasna, every day.</p>  
 <p>4. Dvâzdah-hômâst, 'twelve hômâsts,' are prayers recited for 264 days in honour of twenty-two angels, namely. the twelve aforesaid and the following ten: Bahman, Ardibahi<i>s</i>t, Shahrivar, Mihir, Bahrâm, Râm, Dîn, Rashnû, Gô<i>s</i>, and Â<i>s</i>tâd. Each angel, in turn, is reverenced as in the last.</p>  
 <p>The celebration of hômâst costs 350 rûpîs, that of khadûk-hômâst 422 rûpîs, that of dah-hômâst 1000 rûpîs, and that of dvâzdah-hômâst 2000 rûpîs; but the first and third are now no longer used. The merit obtained by having such recitations performed is equivalent to 1000 tanâpûhars for each Yasna, 10,000 for each Visparad, and 70,000 for each Vendidad recited. A tanâpûhar is now considered as a weight of 1200 dirhams, with which serious sins and works of considerable merit are estimated; originally it must have meant a sin which was 'inexpiable' by ordinary good works, and, conversely, any extraordinary good work which was just sufficient to efface such a sin.</p>  
 <p>The amount of merit attaching to such recitations is variously stated in different books, and when recited with holy-water (that is, with all their ceremonial rites) they are said to be usually a hundred times as meritorious as when recited without it.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1118"></a><a href="sbe0558.htm#fr_1125">214:3</a> This section is the Pahlavi version of an Avesta formula which is appended to nearly two-thirds of the hâs or chapters of the Yasna, and, therefore, indicates the close of the chapter at this point. The version here given contains a few verbal deviations from that given in the Yasna, but none of any importance. The Avesta text of this formula is as follows:</p>  
 <p></p><dir>Yê<font size="-1">N</font>hê hâtãm âa<i>d</i>, yêsnê paitî<br> vanghô mazd<i>a</i>u ahurô vaêthâ, ashâ<i>d</i> ha<i>k</i>â,<br> y<i>a</i>unghãm<i>k</i>â, tãs<i>k</i>â t<i>a</i>us<i>k</i>â yazamaidê.</dir>  
 <p>And it may be translated in the following manner:</p>  
 <p>'Of whatever male of the existences, therefore, Ahuramazda was better cognizant, through righteousness in worship, and of whatever females, both those males and those females we reverence.'</p>
