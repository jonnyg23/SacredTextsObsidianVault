As the average Hâsar is a Roman mile (see Chap. XIX, 54 n), the Ta<i>k</i>ar ('run?') is two, the Agoyôst or Agoyôhast ('cattle-run?' <a name="page_57"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 57</font></a> Av. gaoyaoiti?) is four, the Dashmêst ('distance-mark?') is eight, and the Yû<i>g</i>yâst ('stage?') is sixteen miles. This series of distances is analogous to the Sanskrit series, but more elaborate; the Hâsar is best compared with the Kro<i>s</i>a as the commonest unit of moderate distance, though less than half its usual length; the Agoyôst is nearly the same as the Gavyûta; and the Yû<i>g</i>yâst is analogous to the Yo<i>g</i>ana, though nearly double its length.</p>
