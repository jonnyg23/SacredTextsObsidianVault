 <p align="center"><i>Sakâ</i>d<i>ûm Nask</i>.</p>  
 <p>1. One section of the last twenty-two is the Vakhshistân ('<i>increase code</i>'), particulars about the progress of increase. 2. About atonement, surrender, and compensation <i>for</i> anything, through dispelling <i>it</i> by compensating, atoning, <i>and</i> surrendering to <i>him</i> whose own <i>it is;</i> the period thereof not <i>being</i> appointed. 3. When he, whose origination of compensation, atonement, <i>and</i> surrender is his own, has appointed the period thereof, the growing of the sin actively, after the appointed time, is increase.</p>  
 <p>4. About increase <a name="fr_336"></a><a href="#fn_334"><font size="1">1</font></a> which is active (ka<i>r</i><i>d</i>akŏ), and that which is existent (zîstakŏ); how it is when the existent becomes quite active, and how it is when both are suppressed (armê<i>s</i>tî-aît). 5. About the extraction of increase upon increases which they may occasion <i>up</i> to an equality; where <i>and</i> which <i>it is</i>. 6. About a righteous gift; that is, how it is when overwhelmed by impoverishment, <i>and</i> how it is when its increase still proceeds.</p>  
 <p>7. About the progress of interest (vakhsh) upon effective wealth, when there is interest for it, and the interest thereon accumulates; also that which does not progress; how it is when the debtor (<i>â</i><i>v</i>âm-hômônd), even on bringing back the wealth, is opulent, <i>and</i> the lender (<i>â</i><i>v</i>âm naf<i>s</i>man) is opulent on asking for <i>it</i>; how it is when each is not opulent, <i>and</i> the debtor <i>was</i> not opulent on asking for <i>it; and</i> how it is when the lender (<i>â</i><i>v</i>âm khvê<i>s</i>)</p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_139"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 139</font></a></p>  
 <p>is opulent on asking for <i>it, and</i> the debtor is not opulent through the wealth.</p>  
 <p>8. About where <i>and</i> when the life (zîstanŏ) of the lender has once passed <i>away</i>, how <i>it is</i> when <i>the loan</i> is to be issued anew at the end of the issue (zihî<i>s</i>nŏ), and how it is when <i>it has</i> existed in force, through the one issue <i>by</i> the deceased, <i>and</i> the interest accrues. 9. When the debtor passes away, how it is when he puts the interest into the property of any one through adoption, <i>and</i> how <i>it is</i> when it is the interest of the possessor of the wealth in both worlds.</p>  
 <p>10. About the peculiarity <i>of</i> retribution, the self-retribution of <i>one</i> liable to retribution for others, <i>and</i> the limit of one's own retribution. 11. About the penalty (tâvân) of him who, purchasing <i>animals</i> for impregnation, gives each a bad male; when <i>they are</i> not pregnant, <i>and</i> when they may produce; and whatever is on the same subject. 12. About the time of allowing the admission of the male <i>to</i> the beast <i>of</i> burden, sheep, and camel, and the time of consignment <i>to</i> each separate male for whom reception remains; the <i>case</i> when <i>it is</i> the time for admission of the male (gû<i>s</i>n-hilîh), <i>and</i> the <i>case</i> when <i>it is</i> such a consignment as when the period, which is really originating with the admission of the male, has continued. 13. When, on account of no consignment <i>to</i> the male at the <i>proper</i> time, the female goes on unimpregnated, <i>and there</i> is no pregnancy of the cow, mare, camel, sheep, goat, <i>or</i> pig, each separately, how much the penalty is; <i>also</i> the sin they commit.</p>  
 <p>14. About the camel, mare, cow, <i>or</i> sheep, unto whom <i>there</i> is damaged milk, void of butter (akarag), owing to the appointed time <i>one</i> postpones; also the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_140"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 140</font></a></p>  
 <p>average <i>and</i> least milk of the mare, cow, goat, and sheep, that is, the measure of their one milking, each separately. 15. About the camel, that is, how much is its production of hair in a year, <i>and</i> the extent that the camel is surpassing therein among cattle; of them is also the ass that they allow to be seized upon for as much value as that <i>of</i> the oxen, and the mode of beating them up. 16. Where <i>and</i> how it is when the females of the camel and horse are a multiplying (<i>a</i>fzûnŏ) <i>tending</i> to dissatisfaction; the increase even of increases of the ox, sheep, and goat progresses, <i>and</i> of them how much less is the multiplying of the femalewhich is an increase of increases <i>tending</i> to dissatisfaction, where <i>it is</i> extending over themto be produced than that of the male.</p>  
 <p>17. The camel which is injured <i>on</i> the road, beyond the end of the appointed time, when they keep it <i>at</i> work unlawfully and the road is bad, when <i>at</i> work unlawfully <i>and</i> the road is good, <i>and</i> when comfortable at pasture, where seizing upon it becomes <i>tending</i> to dissatisfaction in several <i>ways</i>, and they are severally buying <i>it</i> when really invigorated <a name="fr_337"></a><a href="#fn_335"><font size="1">1</font></a>, or <i>at</i> a price.</p>  
 <p>18. For how much increase of increases he stands up who is buying also an invigorated dog, <i>or</i> pig, at a price; and when <i>it is that</i> the increase and increase of increases remain undeveloped in them, as it <i>does</i> whenever property, <i>on</i> which the interest of the residue and income accumulates, is still for the children <i>of</i> the well-destined.</p>  
 <p>

 <p>19. About <i>him</i> whose supplies some one is silently (agôpŏ) buying up, and the seller and important holder is quite bereaved, so that the bereaver <i>has</i> plenty for <i>one</i> deprived of food <i>on</i> a summer's day, and plenty for him who is <i>so</i> also <i>on</i> a winter's <i>day</i> (dim-i<i>k</i>îk); <i>also</i> the supplying of mankind and fire lawfully, in the beginning, for a summer's day and night, <i>and</i> that for a winter's one <a name="fr_338"></a><a href="#fn_336"><font size="1">1</font></a>. 20. About clothing when <i>it</i> is <i>that</i> which <i>one</i> strips off for donation. 21. About the penalty for a first deprival of food, <i>and</i> the sin of it; <i>also</i> the penalty of the second and third, up to the tenth.</p>  
 <p>22. About a plaint and defence as regards a debt and its interest, and the decision thereon; also how <i>it is</i> when, for keeping up the repayment, debts upon debts are cancelled so far as the continuance of interest; <i>and</i> whatever is on the same subject. 23. About the uselessness of supplies which are not authorised <i>by</i> the religion. 24. About buying a slaughtered <a name="fr_339"></a><a href="#fn_337"><font size="1">2</font></a> sheep when the seller is bereaved by the delivery; <i>also</i> to how many sheep, in the two previous years, the increase and increase of increases thereof <i>had</i> specially to attain. 25. About where <i>and</i> what is that which would not conduce to increase, <i>and</i> what is that which <i>would</i>. 26. About the special sin and offence, the use of the milk, heart <a name="fr_340"></a><a href="#fn_338"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and wool, the spreading about <i>which tends</i> to dissatisfaction, the increase of increases, and the good</p>

 <p>figure of any one sheep, and the regulation of every one.</p>  
 <p>27. About how the debtor <i>has</i> to announce the nature of the loan, <i>which</i> the lender, through irritation, does not approve; and, when the debtor has provided for a triple issue, when for a double issue, <i>and</i> even when he has for a single issue, the first year is <i>free</i> from begging his own time. 28. About the debtor <i>and</i> what <a name="fr_341"></a><a href="#fn_339"><font size="1">1</font></a> he repays, when each year is announced <i>and</i> he does not assent; <i>and</i> how it happens, as regards the debtor, through many repayments, and all the postponements of the lender <a name="fr_342"></a><a href="#fn_340"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>

 <p>severally, <i>to</i> the end of the winter <i>as regards</i> the cloak, <i>and to</i> the end of the summer <i>as regards</i> the water-skin; that is, <i>for</i> how much gain upon that one cloak, <i>or</i> water-skin, is the retribution of the confiscator to whom <i>it is</i> appertaining <a name="fr_345"></a><a href="#fn_343"><font size="1">1</font></a>; <i>and</i> whatever is on the same subject.</p>
