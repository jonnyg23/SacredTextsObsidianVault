 <p>1. The ninth fargar<i>d</i>, Yathâi<i>s</i> <a name="fr_1336"></a><a href="#fn_1308"><font size="1">2</font></a>, is <i>that</i> by him who praises Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> <i>his</i> work in the Gâthic lore <a name="fr_1337"></a><a href="#fn_1309"><font size="1">3</font></a> is taught; even for this reason, because the reason of the praise even of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is for <i>his</i> works, <i>and</i> by him who extols any work the performance</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_343"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 343</font></a></p>  
 <p>of that work is also taught; <i>moreover</i> the work of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, <i>which is</i> the Gâthic lore, is pure goodness. 2. This, too, that by him who increases the propagators of good works priestly-controlled action (ra<i>d</i>îk-kûni<i>s</i>nîh) <a name="fr_1338"></a><a href="#fn_1310"><font size="1">1</font></a> is taught; even for this reason, because the advancement of merit and the action of priestly chieftainship are the two maxims (vâ<i>k</i>akŏ) of one who, when <i>there</i> is reason, exalts progressive merit when he increases the propagators of good works; and when progressive merit is exalted priestly-controlled action is praised and also taught.</p>  
 <p>3. This, too, that what is worthy, <i>and</i> what is coveted for every worthy <i>man</i>, is produced by him for whom the command of the liturgy is the reckoning for him who is habitually sagacious; and this statement also indicates the explanation of rulers <i>and</i> all who are needing those of the world for one combined effort, who, in the immature world, <i>have</i> to trust a command that is <i>at</i> one time sagacious. 4. This, too, that personal assistance is liberally given (râ<i>d</i>îni<i>d</i>ŏ) to the creatures of the good <i>beings</i> by him whose deeds are an assistance of the renovation <i>of the universe;</i> and this statement, too, also indicates the great power <i>of</i> any good work whatever, because every good work, <i>being</i> an assistance of the renovation, becomes liberality <i>to</i> the immature (khâm) creation.</p>  
 <p>5. This, too, that whoever teaches to a son reverence unto <i>his</i> father has also appropriated the reward for reverence unto the creator for teaching that person; even for this reason, because express reverence unto parents and service to them are connected</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_344"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 344</font></a></p>  
 <p>with reverence unto the creator and service to him. 6. This, too, that whoever is personally progress for him who is his own <a name="fr_1339"></a><a href="#fn_1311"><font size="1">1</font></a>that is, for any one whatever among those who are needing himbecomes the happiness of the creator who is the maker of the original good creations; and this statement also indicates as to whom <i>it is</i>, when, through him whose decision is progresswhich <i>arises</i> through that which <i>occurs</i> when the decision is given that becomes for every one that which is needful for himthere is happiness that is concentrated. 7. This, too, that by him who is causing benefit for him who is a cultivator cattle <a name="fr_1340"></a><a href="#fn_1312"><font size="1">2</font></a> are multiplied; even for this reason, because a gratifier of the performers of tillage is multiplying tillage, <i>and</i> cattle are the chief tillage of the world.</p>  
 <p>8. This, too, that the religion which is the way of righteousness is made his own <a name="fr_1341"></a><a href="#fn_1313"><font size="1">3</font></a> by him who is a good thinker about the religion of righteousness; and this statement, too, also indicates the limit of reliance (asti<i>s</i>nŏ) upon the good religion; because whoever is not a good thinker about the good religion, even though he be a reciter of revelation, becomes really an apostate; whoever is a good thinker, <i>but</i> not about the good religion, becomes really an infidel; and whoever thinks truly becomes a good thinker about religious righteousness and the statements in the good religion. 9. And about three statements, the bringer forward <i>for</i> all mankind is your submission to the sacred beings; one is of the produce (bar), one of the origin (bûn), and</p>

 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_345"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 345</font></a></p>  
 <p>one of the body and life; that of the produce is the exertion from which <i>there</i> is produce, that of the origin is the advantage for which the origin is requisite, and that of the body and life is the thought of the proposer (râyînî<i>d</i>âr), which considered both as submission <i>to</i> the sacred beings. 10. This, too, that connected with the sitting-place of the sage is the excessiveness <i>of</i> the pleasure <a name="fr_1342"></a><a href="#fn_1314"><font size="1">1</font></a> for those causing pleasure, for the upper classes (<i>a</i><i>v</i>arîgânŏ) of Irân, <i>and</i> for the energy (patûkîh) <a name="fr_1343"></a><a href="#fn_1314"><font size="1">1</font></a> of the diligent.</p>  
 <p>11. Excellence <i>that is</i> perfect is righteousness.</p>
