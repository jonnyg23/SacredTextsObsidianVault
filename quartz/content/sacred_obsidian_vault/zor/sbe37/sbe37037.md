 <p><a name="fn_275"></a><a href="sbe37037.htm#fr_276">107:2</a> Written 4 + 2 (= six) in the MS., but this is a most unusual way of writing 'six;' it is more probable that we ought to read 4 + 3, the usual mode of writing 'seven.' 'Seven evil-doers of sin of a heinous kind' are detailed in Dd. LXXII, 2-9.</p>
