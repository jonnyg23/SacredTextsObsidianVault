 <p>1. The seventeenth fargar<i>d</i>, Yêzî <a name="fr_1464"></a><a href="#fn_1431"><font size="1">3</font></a>, is <i>that</i> whoever maintains the benedictions of the religion <a name="fr_1465"></a><a href="#fn_1432"><font size="1">4</font></a>, and shall uphold its commands, has thereby made even others learn it; even for this reason, because through this <i>it</i> is much more possible for him to attract others to the religion; <i>and, as to</i> the origin and means of attraction, the attraction is this, that he himself maintains the benedictions of the religion, and the means of attraction are this, that he is an upholder of the commands of the religion.</p>  
 <p>2. This, too, that by him who shall perform the ritual of an ordeal which is accomplished, the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i></p>

 <p>passage <a name="fr_1466"></a><a href="#fn_1433"><font size="1">1</font></a> is made known; even for this reason, because those even <i>who have</i> accomplished what is a work of the spirit become witnesses, one about the other, as to the facts. 3. This, too, that by him who shall perform that thing whereby a change occurs from evil to good <a name="fr_1467"></a><a href="#fn_1434"><font size="1">2</font></a>, even that change which is the renovation <i>of the universe</i> is made known, by means even of the evidence of a partial change as regards a perpetual change.</p>  
 <p>4. This, too, that by him who shall produce generosity for the tillers <a name="fr_1468"></a><a href="#fn_1435"><font size="1">3</font></a> of the world it is then developed; even for this reason, because they become more diligent <i>in</i> tilling the world. 5. This, too, that by him who shall produce benefit for the poor, a development <a name="fr_1469"></a><a href="#fn_1436"><font size="1">4</font></a> of the world is produced for them; even for this reason, because through that reason they increase more.</p>  
 <p>6. This, too, that the creature-forming (dâmîh) of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> <a name="fr_1470"></a><a href="#fn_1437"><font size="1">5</font></a> is occasioned by him whose rule <a name="fr_1471"></a><a href="#fn_1438"><font size="1">6</font></a> is for Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; even for this reason, because he becomes a holder and attendant of good works. 7. This, too, that the devastation by Vohûman <a name="fr_1472"></a><a href="#fn_1439"><font size="1">7</font></a> is taught <i>by</i> him whose rule is for Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; even for this reason, because he smites sinners <i>and</i> destroys among villains.</p>  
 <p>8. This, too, that virtuous people are increased in a province <a name="fr_1473"></a><a href="#fn_1440"><font size="1">8</font></a> by him who appoints a virtuous governor of the province. 9. This, too, that virtuous instruction is provided <i>and</i> explained by him who loves Vohûman <a name="fr_1474"></a><a href="#fn_1441"><font size="1">9</font></a>. 10. And this, too, that virtuous</p>

 <p>deeds <a name="fr_1475"></a><a href="#fn_1442"><font size="1">1</font></a> are set going by him who teaches learned sayings <i>and</i> virtuous deeds to him who is good; even for this reason, because the reception <i>of</i> the progressive supply of virtue by the learned becomes more complete.</p>  
 <p>11. Perfect is the excellence of righteousness.</p>
