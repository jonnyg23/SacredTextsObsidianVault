 <p>In the name and <i>for</i> the propitiation of the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> these several commentaries (zand) are published from revelation (dênô).</p>  
 <p align="center">The names of the twenty-one Nasks.</p>  
 <p>1. One is this that is Yathâ, that is, the Stô<i>d</i>-ya<i>s</i>t, <i>and</i> the subdivisions of this Stô<i>d</i>-ya<i>s</i>t are thirty-three. In that Nask are the blessing <i>and</i> propitiation of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> and the archangels, and they are <i>for</i> the utterance of praise. Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> sends this Nask into the world, which is suitable for every one, <i>and</i> whoever has committed this Nask to memory recites <i>it</i>. And to every one who, being-a high-priest, becomes a reciter of both the Avesta and Zand, <i>and</i> shall recite that Nask three times with correctness, the archangels will come near; as to this they know <i>it</i> without doubt.</p>  
 <p>2. The second Nask is that <i>which is</i> Ahû, the Stû<i>d</i>gar, <i>and</i> the subdivisions of that Nask are</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_439"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 439</font></a></p>  
 <p>twenty-two. In it are the giving of advice <i>to</i> mankind, the performance of prayer and virtue, the doing of good actions, intercession, producing union among relations, <i>and</i> such-like topics.</p>  
 <p>3. The third is Vairyô, the Vahi<i>s</i>t-mânsar, <i>and</i> the subdivisions of this Nask are twenty-two. In this is the topic of those who are becoming without doubt as to the religion of Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worship, causing heedfulness, and thinking about the religion; also the production of the benediction and attributes (s<i>i</i>fât) of the blessedness of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, every action which was declared virtuous before Zaratû<i>s</i>t, and all actions which have to occur after Zaratû<i>s</i>t until the future existence; the benefit of his world, and such-like topics.</p>  
 <p>4. The fourth Nask is this <i>which is</i> Athâ, the Bagh, <i>and</i> the subdivisions of that Nask are twenty-one. In this the topic is this which is the purpose of the religion of Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worship, and the ideas which Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> caused <i>to be</i> taught unto mankind; the exercise of reverence, heedfulness, adjudication, and justice; the performance of the proper duty of decision, doing good actions (kâr-î khvaîr), closing the way of Aharman into oneself, attaining unto the spiritual <i>existence</i> for oneself, <i>and</i> such as are like <i>these</i>.</p>  
 <p>5. The fifth Nask is Ratu<i>s</i>, the Dvâzdak-hômâst, <i>and</i> the subdivisions of that Nask are thirty-two. In that Nask are all the topics of the spiritual <i>existence and</i> the heavenly state, virtue and vileness, the material <i>existence</i> of this worldly state, about the sky and about the earth, and everything which Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> produced <i>and which</i> exists in the water, fire, and plants; human beings and</p>  
 <p><a name="page_440"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 440</font></a></p>  
 <p>quadrupeds, grazing animals and birds, and everything which is similarly produced from any (<i>a</i><i>ê</i><i>k</i>) <i>of them</i>, and the characteristics of all things. Secondly, that which is the production of the resurrection and future existence, and the coming together and separation <i>at</i> the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> pass; the recompense for the doers of good works and the punishment for sinners occur through the future existence, <i>and</i> such-like topics as <i>these</i> are.</p>  
 <p>6. The sixth Nask is Ashâ<i>d</i>, the Nâdûr, <i>and</i> the subdivisions of that are thirty-five. In this Nask are the purposes of the stars (nu<i>g</i>ûm), the zodiac, and the planets, the goodness and evil of each constellation, and the movement of all the planets in the signs of the zodiac (bûr<i>g</i>) and lunar mansions (mahîgân nu<i>g</i>ûm). They have translated <i>it</i> into Arabic and Persian, and the name they have adopted <i>for</i> this book is Bûtâl, <i>and</i> in Persian the name which is appointed for it is Kapâm<i>â</i><i>g</i>ân.</p>  
 <p>7. The seventh is this <i>which is</i> <i>K</i>î<i>d</i>, <i>and</i> is the P<i>â</i><i>g</i>am, and its subdivisions are twenty-two. In this P<i>â</i><i>g</i>am Nask is the topic of the slaughtering of quadrupeds <i>and</i> sheep, how <i>they</i> are to be slaughtered, of which among the quadrupeds the command is that it is allowable to eat, and of which kind the eating is not allowable; how <i>he</i> who slaughters shall strike at the time of the expiring of the sheep. The more expenditure (saraf) <i>one</i> makes upon a season-festival, so much the more is the reward; how much it is expedient to bestow upon the Dastûrs, Môbads, and Hêrbads, and upon the unwavering practisers of good works <i>in</i> the good religion; what merit accrues <i>to</i> every one</p>  
 <p><a name="page_441"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 441</font></a></p>  
 <p>who celebrates a season-festival and consecrates clothing for a soul, <i>and</i> who, <i>for</i> that reason, is in the supreme heaven <i>in</i> the last times; and it is necessary to give clothing to relations <i>and</i> the righteous as a righteous gift, <i>and</i> to exercise mediation on the part of the righteous; the five greater and lesser days of the guardian spirits, and the practice of good works on <i>these</i> ten days is enjoined in this Nask. It is requisite for all people that they shall read this book with good and wise understanding, that all <i>may</i> become aware of its topics.</p>  
 <p>8. The eighth Nask is that <i>which is</i> Ha<i>k</i>â, the Ratu<i>s</i>tâîh, <i>and</i> the subdivisions of that Nask <i>were</i> fifty when the accursed Alexander had the Nasks burnt up, <i>but</i> after that, <i>as</i> they sought out this Nask, <i>only</i> thirteen of those subdivisions came to hand, and no <i>more</i> remained of those previously <i>existing</i>. In this Nask are the reasons of performing service, giving orders, and remaining at the command of kings and at the command of high-priests and judges; the adornment-preserving <a name="fr_1728"></a><a href="#fn_1687"><font size="1">1</font></a> purpose of cities is declared, the command of religion, and things made magnificently (a<i>g</i><i>î</i><i>z</i>îhâ), grazing animals, birds, cattle, and fish; everything which is a production of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> <i>or</i> Aharman; all the purposes of all the seas, mountains, and lands; <i>and matter</i> similar <i>to</i> such as are mentioned.</p>  
 <p>9. The ninth Nask is this <i>which is</i> Vangh<i>e</i>u<i>s</i>, <i>and</i> is the Bari<i>s</i>; the subdivisions of that Nask were first sixty, <i>but</i> after the accursed Alexander <i>only</i> twelve remained. <i>As to</i> the information in this Nask, just as there is the sovereignty for <i>those</i></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_442"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 442</font></a></p>  
 <p>who are kings, so <i>there</i> is the usage which it is necessary <i>for them</i> to practise, and the command of the sentence of judges of the religion such as is necessary to be executed; the custody and protection for the world, and making each new city flourishing; also the reasons of people, who are false-speaking, sinners, <i>and</i> such-like, are mentioned in this Nask.</p>  
 <p>10. The tenth Nask is that <i>which is</i> Dazdâ, the Ka<i>s</i>srôb, <i>and</i> the subdivisions of that Nask were formerly sixty, <i>but</i> after the accursed Alexander <i>only</i> fifteen subdivisions remained. In that Nask the topic is that which is wisdom and knowledge, the reason of <i>its</i> being brought forth from the mother, and the teaching of wisdom <i>by</i> demonstration, the performance of purification and the speaking of truth; bringing people from vileness unto virtue, and bringing <i>them</i> from defilement and pollution unto purity; greatness and good progeny arise for people near kings, and how the habit of people telling lies, to others and to kings, arises; <i>and</i> such-like as <i>these</i>.</p>  
 <p>11. The eleventh Nask was Mananghô, the Vî<i>s</i>tâspâ<i>d</i>, <i>and</i> the subdivisions of that Nask were sixty, <i>but</i> after the accursed Alexander <i>only</i> ten remained. In this Nask is the topic of the sovereignty of Gû<i>s</i>tâsp, and Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtâmân, <i>having</i> brought the religion from Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, king Gu<i>s</i>tâsp accepted <i>it</i>, and made <i>it</i> current in the world; <i>and</i> such-like as <i>these</i>.</p>  
 <p>12. The twelfth is <i>S</i><i>h</i>yaothananãm, the Khûst, <i>and</i> the subdivisions of that Nask were first twenty-two, <i>but</i> after the accursed Alexander <i>only</i> six remained. Among those six, which are the first</p>  
 <p><a name="page_443"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 443</font></a></p>  
 <p>portions (zizp = Ar. <i>g</i>izb), the topics in <i>one</i> portion are the attributes (sifât) of the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, and the understanding <i>of them;</i> also being without doubt about the religion of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, the Spîtâmân, all the duty and good works which are prescribed in the religion, <i>and</i> such-like. In the second portion is the reason of service for kings, the truth of the religion, submission <i>to</i> all <i>its</i> commands, and withholding <i>one's</i> hand from evil actions, so that it <i>has</i> become far from mischief. In the third portion is that which is the debt for performers of virtuous position, the advantage <i>of</i> good works, the final release from hell, <i>and</i> such-like. The fourth is the reason of the creation of the world, the practice of agriculture, the cultivation of trees, the date-tree and every fruit-tree; whence arises most strength for people and animals; being under the command of the practisers of good works <i>and</i> the virtuous, and being under the command of the high-priests, <i>and</i> such-like as they are. In the fifth portion all the specimens of mankind are mentioned: <i>they</i> who are of great knowledge, who are kings, judges, and the sages of the religion; in the second specimen are <i>they</i> that <i>have</i> to keep watch <i>over</i> all the cities, and to make the enemy confounded; in the third specimen are these whose object <i>one</i> mentions <i>in the term</i> 'husbandmen;' the fourth specimen which <i>one</i> mentions <i>are</i> these who are the greatly-skilled and sitters in the market, grandiloquent to repel loss, giving one-tenth to the high-priest and king, and offering praise on hardened knees, the last reward of which is that <i>one</i> obtains in the spiritual <i>existence</i>.</p>  
 <p>13. The thirteenth Nask is that which is Angh<i>e</i>u<i>s</i>,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_444"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 444</font></a></p>  
 <p>the Spend; its subdivisions are sixty which are precious unto people of pedigrees (mâyagân) and <i>those who</i> possess much avidity for virtuous actions and <i>have</i> to proceed <i>in</i> the footsteps (pâî-rapîh) <i>of</i> the great and religious; <i>also</i> accounts of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, who is born from the womb of Dûghd<i>â</i><i>v</i>ŏ, till ten years <i>of age</i>. Every Dastûr and Môbad shall recite this Nask in purity, and with ease and the proper words, <i>for</i> several days, and shall obtain every desire of his own, or <i>any</i> wish which he claims on account of (ba<i>r</i>â râî-î) others.</p>  
 <p>14. The fourteenth Nask is that <i>which is</i> Mazdâi; the name Zira<i>s</i>t is appointed <i>for it, and</i> the subdivisions of that Nask are twenty-two. In like manner this Nask is sent <i>by</i> Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, which is to make manifest to the people what is the purpose <i>of</i> that science through which mankind are born from the womb of a mother, how many individuals among them will die <i>away</i> from the womb, and how many individuals will live; how many persons <i>and</i> people among them become kings, and how many, meanwhile (fîmâ), exercise apostleship, that is, the high-priesthood; how many are the grandest of people, and how many are the meanest <i>of</i> mankind, <i>and</i> in what mode this occurs; from first to last, the time people are born and all those topics are in this Nask.</p>  
 <p>15. The fifteenth is Khshathrem<i>k</i>â, <i>and</i> the name of that Nask is Baghân-ya<i>s</i>t, <i>and</i> its subdivisions are seventeen. In it are the topics of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> the lord and the archangels, the knowledge of their attributes, and the service <i>and</i> sublimity <i>of</i> Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; at what time every Gâh occurs until the future existence, and what duty is</p>  
 <p><a name="page_445"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 445</font></a></p>  
 <p>performed; offering praise <i>for</i> every benefit <i>from</i> Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, and obtaining benefit from him; the appearance of the archangels, and knowing what is such-and-such an appearance of such-and-such an archangel in the future existence. This Nask used in the service of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> and the archangels is very excellent.</p>  
 <p>16. The sixteenth is Ahurâi, <i>and</i> they have appointed it the name Niyârâm; the subdivisions of that Nask are fifty-four, about the reason of preserving wealth and placing <i>it</i> out, agreement <i>and</i> measure <i>by</i> the cubit <i>and</i> handful; everything the creator Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> has ordained <i>as</i> uncontaminated, release from hell, and how to walk in the path of reverence and worship; what is in the mind of man, and what is everything in the body of man; <i>and</i> such-like as <i>these that</i> are mentioned.</p>  
 <p>17. The seventeenth Nask is that which is Â, <i>and</i> the name they have appointed <i>for</i> it is Aspârûm; one mentions sixty-five subdivisions of it, <i>and</i> in this Nask is every religious topic which all persons well understand, and the punishment suffered <i>by</i> sinners, which they receive in <i>their</i> last career; everything which is uncontaminated is allowable, <i>and what</i> is not uncontaminated is not allowable; the stars preside over the destiny of mankind; and such-like as <i>these</i>.</p>  
 <p>18. The eighteenth Nask is that <i>which is</i> Yim, that <i>has</i> the name Duvâsarôzad appointed <i>for it</i>, and the subdivisions of it are likewise sixty-five. In this Nask are the reasons of next-of-kin marriage, forming connections among relations, and such-like as <i>these</i>.</p>  
 <p>19. The nineteenth Nask is Drigubyô, the name</p>  
 <p><a name="page_446"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 446</font></a></p>  
 <p>of which is Askâram, <i>and</i> is of fifty-two stanzas (v<i>ê</i><i>k</i>astihâ), <i>about</i> the giving of orders, exercise of authority, and practising wisdom in everything; producing the resurrection, <i>by</i> which every person passed <i>away</i> is made living again, and the malformations of Aharman and the demons are withered away; <i>and</i> such-like.</p>  
 <p>20. The twentieth Nask is that <i>which is</i> Dada<i>d</i>, that they call <i>by</i> its name of Vendîdâ<i>d</i>, where the meaning <i>of</i> this is 'the law against the demons,' which is of twenty-two fargar<i>d</i>s. The topic <i>of</i> it is what preserves mankind from evil <i>and</i> pollution, and will restrain <i>them</i> from the menstruous, dead matter, pestilence, and running sores. Of all the twenty-one Nasks the Nask of 'the law against the demons' has <i>alone</i> remained entire; while several remain scattered by the wickedness (<i>s</i>ûmîh) of the accursed Alexander, this Nask of the Vendîdâ<i>d</i> remained in hand, <i>and</i> owing to its elucidation the religion of Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worship exists now.</p>  
 <p>21. The twenty-first Nask is Vâstârem, whose name <i>one</i> calls Hâdôkht, <i>and its</i> fargar<i>d</i>s are said <i>to be</i> thirty. In it are much excellence and many miracles, and the vile Aharman becomes far from every one who recites this Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht, and it makes <i>him</i> extinct, and <i>the reciter</i> comes near <i>unto</i> Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> and becomes purified from sin.</p>  
 <p>22. Now, alas! if all these Nasks do not remain, so that <i>one</i> is not able to solemnize <i>them</i>, that is for this reason, that the accursed Alexander, the Arûman, took several transcriptsin the Arûman language and characters (hurûfŏ)of any among those twenty-one Nasks which were <i>about</i> the stars and medicine, and burnt up the other Nasks; and</p>  
 <p><a name="page_447"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 447</font></a></p>  
 <p>the soul of the accursed Alexander, the Rûman, will remain wretched and burnt in gloomy hell till the resurrection, owing to his own vileness which injured the religion of Zaratû<i>s</i>t.</p>  
 <p>23. After the villany of Alexander, an assemblage of several high-priests, who were sages of the religion, brought the Avesta of all <i>of them</i> from various places, <i>and</i> made a collection of so much Avesta and Zand <i>as</i> the sacred (ya<i>s</i>tô) Yasna, Vîspera<i>d</i>, Vendîdâ<i>d</i>, Ar<i>d</i>â-fravar<i>d</i>, and other scraps of the Avesta, the Darûn, <i>A</i>f<i>rî</i>ngân, and the Commands of the religion; all these <i>were</i> written, and the Bûndahi<i>s</i> book <i>was</i> correctly written; <i>and</i> all such, among them, as <i>were</i> not written, which did not come into the thoughts of the sages, departed, on that account, from the midst of the many topics of revelation.</p>  
 <p>24. Just as it is said that <i>there</i> were twenty-one Nasks, there are first, in seven Nasks, the topics of the religion <i>of</i> Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worship, in the second seven Nasks are the topics of medical practice, <i>and</i> in the third seven Nasks the topics and capabilities of the stars are mentioned.</p>
