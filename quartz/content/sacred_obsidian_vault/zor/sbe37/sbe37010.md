 <p>share <i>of</i> the fires and waters to be taken <a name="fr_62"></a><a href="#fn_62"><font size="1">1</font></a>, <i>and</i> how is the preparation which is to be carried on, <i>and</i> with what Avesta. 3. And whatever is about a season-festival; where the appointed place is, when one celebrates <i>it, and</i> when it has fully elapsed; the assembly of the season-festival, and the donation for the feast; where and when the celebration is possible, in what proportion the provisions are to be given out, <i>and</i> when to be prepared <i>and</i> divided; where its advantage is, <i>and</i> what benefit <i>there</i> is from it to the good creations both spiritually and materially.</p>  
 <p>4. And this, namely, what skill is more suitable for the sacerdotal (ra<i>d</i>-pî<i>s</i>ag) leadership <i>and</i> other priestly authority (ra<i>d</i>îh) each separately. 5. About the business <i>of</i> the sacerdotal leadership, where <i>it is</i> owing to <i>having</i> appointed the place and <i>having</i> gone forth to the assembly of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, <i>and</i> when <i>they are</i> to be made aware that that assembly is more particularly for the arrangement of renunciation of vice and retribution for sin; the needful supply of things for the feast; the selection of the men for the Zôti duty <i>and</i> Râspî duty before the day <a name="fr_63"></a><a href="#fn_63"><font size="1">2</font></a>; the Zôtis, Râspîs, and others who put in action the work for the preparation <i>and</i> giving of the portions; <i>and</i> the cleansing of the body-clothing. 6. <i>As to</i> the selection <i>of</i> the president (pê<i>s</i>-gâs) of the feast <i>there</i> is this, namely, what ability is requisite for that presidentship. 7.

 <p>priestly authorities, <i>who are</i> great <i>and</i> good, <i>and</i> when they do not give a portion to the authorities are <i>cases when</i> the season-festivals are not to be considered as celebrated. 9. This, too, that the Zôtis and Râspîs are for the Zôti duty <i>and</i> Râspî duty, <i>and</i> the other priestly authorities for the control of sin and computation (<i>â</i><i>v</i>âr) of the portions; and more on the same subject.</p>  
 <p>10. About the rotation of the day-watches (gâs), days, months, and seasons of the yearwhich are when <i>it</i> is summer <i>and</i> winterand the appearances (sahî<i>s</i>nŏ) therein which are owing to the motion of the constellations <a name="fr_64"></a><a href="#fn_64"><font size="1">1</font></a>. 11. Where the coming of the righteous guardian spirits (fravâhar) into the worldly <i>existence occurs</i>, in those ten days which are the end of the winter <i>and</i> termination of the year, because the five Gâthic days <a name="fr_65"></a><a href="#fn_65"><font size="1">2</font></a>, among them, are for that purpose; the cessation of that same, as well as its continuance. 12. The great needfulness <i>of</i> the guardian spirits of the righteous in the ceremonial <i>and</i> obeisance of those ten days, <i>and</i> their abundant gratification therefrom; their vexation from</p>

 <p>want of welcome and want of obeisance; and <i>their</i> ascent from the worldly existences. 13. The extreme importance (fr<i>ê</i><i>v</i>ŏânîkîh) <i>of</i> liberality and bounty at that season; and the proper duty <i>of</i> the priestly authority of a district (shat<i>r</i>ô) in assisting and interceding for the poor, for the sake of teaching, from the days devoted to the guardian spirits, <i>proper</i> actions among those having guardian spit its.</p>  
 <p>14. About the period for taking medicinal plants, and whatever is on the same subject. 15. About where <i>there</i> is a household, village, communal, <i>or</i> provincial petitioning <i>for</i> the royal chastisement <i>of</i> sins affecting the soul, each separately; <i>and</i> for whom is the atonement. 16. About the advantage owing to disposal of sin and infliction of chastisement, and the harm owing to not disposing of sin and neglecting the chastisement inflicted.</p>  
 <p>17. About the first thirty-three chieftainships (ra<i>d</i>îh), around <i>and</i> concealed; that is, which <i>and</i> how many are spiritual, <i>and</i> how many worldly; and which is the second, and which the third, of the spiritual <i>and</i> worldly <i>existences</i>. 18. About the admirableness and great meritoriousness <i>of</i> public observances, and the awfulness and grievous sinfulness <i>of</i> apostasy. 19. And also this, that is, when any one is doubtful, through apostasy, which is the law from the sacred beings in elucidation, and which of the sacred beings is to be entreated for assistance. 20. About this, namely, <i>for</i> which of the women the bringing of a handful of anything, from the property <i>of her</i> husband, <i>to be</i> given away is allowable, in what proportion, and how, <i>and</i> for whom; and for whom, when she gives <i>it</i> away, <i>it</i> is allowable <i>for</i> the husband to bring <i>it</i> back.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_19"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 19</font></a></p>  
 <p>21. About this, namely, when summer comes on, where does winter run to; and when winter comes on, where does summer go to? 22.

Pâ<i>g</i>ag probably means 'cooking,' with reference to the preparations for the sacred feasts; it is called Pâ<i>g</i>am, Pâ<i>k</i>am, or Pâzûn in the Rivâyats, which also state that it contained twenty-two kardah, or subdivisions.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_61"></a><a href="sbe37010.htm#fr_61">15:3</a> The six Gâhanbârs or season-festivals are held on the five days ending, respectively, with the 45th, 105th, 180th, 210th, 290th, and 365th days of the Parsi year (see Sls. XVIII, 3 n).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_63"></a><a href="sbe37010.htm#fr_63">16:2</a> The Zôti is the chief officiating priest in the ceremonial, and the Râspî is the assistant priest.</p>

They are also called fravar<i>d</i>îkân, or 'those devoted to the Fravar<i>d</i>s,' or Fravashis, the guardian spirits, or prototypes, of created beings, who are supposed to revisit their old haunts on earth during those days. The last five days of the twelfth month are also considered a part of the same festival of ten days, which would have terminated at the vernal equinox, as indicated in the text, about A.D. 1000 if the ordinary receding calendar of the Irânian Parsis were used; but it seems probable, from Bd. XXV, that the calendar in those times was fixed for the new year to begin at the vernal equinox.</p>
