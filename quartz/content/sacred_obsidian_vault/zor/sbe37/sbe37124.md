 <p>2. The fourth <i>book</i> is matter for instruction from the statements selected, from the instruction of the good religion, by the saintly (hû-fravar<i>d</i>ŏ) Âtû<i>r</i>-farnbag <a name="fr_1659"></a><a href="#fn_1618"><font size="1">1</font></a>, son of Farukhŏ-zâ<i>d</i> <i>and</i> leader of those of the good religion.</p>  
 <p>3. From the Selection of Customary Instruction <a name="fr_1660"></a><a href="#fn_1619"><font size="1">2</font></a> there is <i>this:Number</i> one is the actual original evolution <a name="fr_1661"></a><a href="#fn_1620"><font size="1">3</font></a>, resembling only himself <i>and</i> not designed (<i>k</i>imîk). 4. <i>Number</i> two, the duplication of the first among those akin (khvê<i>s</i>îgân) owing to the consciousness of creationwhich is the firstis Vohûman; but <i>it is</i> his origin, concealed from the destroyer, which is the reason of the creation.</p>  
 <p align="center">.     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .</p>  
 <p>10. <i>Number</i> three is the original creature Ashavahi<i>s</i>t <a name="fr_1662"></a><a href="#fn_1621"><font size="1">4</font></a>due to development among those akin, one out of anotherwho possesses the third place among the archangels, for the reverence of the first.</p>  
 <p align="center">.     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .</p>

 <p>those akin, is named Shatraver <a name="fr_1663"></a><a href="#fn_1622"><font size="1">1</font></a>, the necessity of the stored-up (a<i>v</i>ar-gû<i>d</i>ŏ) nature of a spiritual lord arisen from the reverence of the perfectly just doer Ashavahi<i>s</i>t, who is the third in arising from him who is the second, Vohûman, who is the first creature.     .     .     .     .       19. So, too, the sovereignty of the religion is ever specially good sovereignty <i>and</i> triumphant, and the true religion is confident; the will of the sacred beings in the world is progress, and the comprisal of every knowledge is in the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping religion; the correct attainment of its good sovereignty and their joint statement are together really on account of their concealed good protection and progressive production, one for the other. 20. They strive for the powerful maintenance of the religious good monarchy of rulers, trusty <i>in</i> religion through practising Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worship; the law of the rulers is custom, and their custom is religious.</p>  
 <p>21. Vi<i>s</i>tâsp <a name="fr_1664"></a><a href="#fn_1623"><font size="1">2</font></a>, the king when he became relieved (pardakhtŏ) from the war with Ar<i>g</i>âsp <a name="fr_1665"></a><a href="#fn_1624"><font size="1">3</font></a>, sent to the chief rulers about the acceptance of the religion, 'and the writings <a name="fr_1666"></a><a href="#fn_1625"><font size="1">4</font></a> <i>of</i> the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping religion, which are studded with all knowledge through resources and learning of many kinds, and <i>also</i> the tongue <i>of</i> a Magian man (Magôî-gab<i>r</i>â), arisen <i>in</i> the very same instructed duty, it is expedient you <i>should</i> send (<i>s</i>ed<i>r</i>ûnê<i>d</i>ŏ) <i>there</i>with.' 22.

 <p>26. Shahpûhar <a name="fr_1674"></a><a href="#fn_1633"><font size="1">2</font></a>, king of kings <i>and</i> son of A<i>r</i>takhshatar, again brought together also the writings which <i>were</i> distinct from religion, about the investigation of medicine and astronomy, time, place, <i>and</i> quality, creation (dahi<i>s</i>nŏ), existence, <i>and</i> destruction (vinâsi<i>s</i>nŏ), the submission of a wild beast <a name="fr_1675"></a><a href="#fn_1634"><font size="1">3</font></a>, evidence, and other records and resources <i>that</i> were scattered among the Hindûs, <i>and in</i> Arûm <a name="fr_1676"></a><a href="#fn_1635"><font size="1">4</font></a> and other lands; and he ordered <i>their</i> collocation again with the Avesta, <i>and</i> the presentation of a correct copy of each to the treasury of Shapîgân <a name="fr_1677"></a><a href="#fn_1636"><font size="1">5</font></a>; and the settlement (astînî<i>d</i>anŏ) of all the erring upon the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping religion, for proper consideration, was effected.</p>

 <p>and brought all statements to proper consideration and investigation; <i>and</i> after the preservation of Âtû<i>r</i>pâ<i>d</i> <a name="fr_1679"></a><a href="#fn_1638"><font size="1">1</font></a>, through the statement which he maintained (pasâkhtŏ) with all those <i>of</i> different sects, and the Nasks were enumerated, he also spoke this even <i>to</i> those who <i>were</i> heterodox, namely: 'Now, when the religion is recognised by us in the worldly <i>existence</i>, we do most diligently endeavour <i>that</i> they shall not allow the infidelity (agdênôîh) of any one whatever;' and he acted accordingly.</p>  
 <p>28. This (le-denman-1-î <a name="fr_1680"></a><a href="#fn_1639"><font size="1">2</font></a>) Khûsrôî <a name="fr_1681"></a><a href="#fn_1640"><font size="1">3</font></a>, king of kings <i>who is</i> son of Kavâ<i>d</i>, as apostasy and tyranny <i>were</i> fully antagonistically smitten by him <a name="fr_1682"></a><a href="#fn_1641"><font size="1">4</font></a>, and information and redoubled proper consideration <i>were</i> abundantly augmentedthrough a declaration from the religion unto every apostasy of the four classes (pî<i>s</i>akŏ)also spoke even this as to winning the sacred beings (ya<i>z</i><i>d</i>ân kharî<i>d</i>îh), namely: The truth of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping religion is fully understood, <i>and</i> the intelligent <i>are</i> steadfastly capable through proper consideration; but recognition by the worldly <i>existence has</i> mostly become exceedingly scattered, <i>and</i> the particulars are not possible through proper consideration, but through purity <i>of</i> thought,</p>

 <p>word, and deed, and the statements of the good spirit, the liturgical ceremonial of the sacred beings with purity.</p>  
 <p>29. We also call, each of those called by us, a priest of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, whose perception of the spiritual <i>existence</i> is manifested unto us; and our wide resources, the perception of the spiritual <i>existence and</i> the example of the worldly <i>one</i>, are likewise indications <i>of</i> both natures <i>that are</i> complete. 30. And we invite (bavîhûnêm) those invited <a name="fr_1683"></a><a href="#fn_1642"><font size="1">1</font></a>, even with that excellence <i>and</i> efficiency which are due to them, on account of which the sacred beings are predominantly over Irân; the country of Irân <i>having</i> proceeded onwards through instruction from the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping religion which the ancients celebrated. 31. The knowledge <i>of</i> the sociable ceremonial (ham-ya<i>z</i>i<i>s</i>nîh)for which, indeed, those of the intelligent of disunited Khvanîras are not in a dispute of antagonismis, <i>in</i> that way, mostly the sonorous (aêv<i>â</i><i>z</i>îk) Avesta, in the pure statement of the writing adornable by memoranda of particulars; and even the simple wordless (av<i>â</i><i>k</i>îk) mode is maintained in the announcement of the statement.</p>  
 <p>32. Even then all the domestic (khânîk) knowledge of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping religion is really on this account, which is understood by us, that, when all are intellectual (vîr-hômônd), and the proper consideration of a stranger (bîgânakŏ) is owing to the world of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping religion, they arrive at this place. 33. <i>But</i> through the new possession and proper consideration <i>of</i> the stranger, owing to the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping religion, they are</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_417"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 417</font></a></p>  
 <p>not capable of bringing about so much acquirement <i>and</i> manifestation of knowledge, for the advantage and open duty of the worldly<i></i> existence, as is in the recitation of a priestly master through much investigation, and is abundantly well-considered. 34. And. if we command, with the utmost solicitude, the proper consideration of the Avesta and Zand of the primitive Magian statements (Magôî-gobi<i>s</i>nŏ), which are more humbly observant, better disposed, good, <i>and</i> ever renewed uneffacedly, <i>as well as</i> an increase of acquirement worthily therefrom, for the knowledge of those <i>of</i> the world, <i>there is</i> no necessity of first acquiring the quality of creation from the creator, <i>by</i> those who are worldly <i>existences</i>, for understanding the creator and the marvellousness <i>of</i> the spiritual <i>existences;</i> or all necessity of acquiring is said <i>to be</i> longing through scanty knowledge.</p>  
 <p>35. They who are a counterpart (aê<i>d</i>ûnŏîh) of manifestation from the religionand even through the resemblance <i>there</i> is a possibility of the existence of understanding<i>are</i> mentioned as effecting proper consideration (hû-sikâl-gar); and he who <i>has</i> to exhibit enlightenment (rôshanô) through knowledge, <i>has</i> to maintain acquaintance <i>with</i> the religion. 36. And since the origin of every knowledge is the religion, alike through spiritual power, and alike through worldly manifestation <a name="fr_1684"></a><a href="#fn_1643"><font size="1">1</font></a>, that which any one <i>has</i> wisely spokeneven though not considered by him <i>as</i> similarly beheld (ham-dî<i>d</i>ŏ) by any Avesta declarationis still then accounted as a manifestation from the religion, whose business is</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1617"></a><a href="sbe37124.htm#fr_1658">410:2</a> This book commences with an account of the seven archangels, and, illustrative of the 'desirable dominion' personified in Shatraver, the fourth of them, a statement is made of the legendary history of the efforts made by the good rulers, from Vi<i>s</i>tâsp to Khûsrôî Anôsharavân, for the preservation of Avesta and Pahlavi <a name="page_411"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 411</font></a> literature. Most of this statement has been already translated at the end of Haug's Essay on Pahlavi, from a less perfect MS. than B, but, as some of the accompanying text is obscure, it has now been necessary to translate the whole of it to ascertain its connection clearly, although only so much of this translation is here given as will indicate this connection in a general way.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1618"></a><a href="sbe37124.htm#fr_1659">411:1</a> Who held a religious disputation with the accursed Abâli<i>s</i> in the presence of the Khalîfah Al-Mâmûn (A.D. 813-833), as stated in the Mâ<i>d</i>îgân-î Gu<i>g</i>astak Abâli<i>s</i>. He appears to have been the first compiler of the Dinka<i>r</i><i>d</i>, especially of its first two Books which are still undiscovered (see Dk. III, Chap. last, 9, in Introduction; Sg, IV, 107, IX, 3, X, 55). Dk. IV, V are taken from his statements, as well as a portion of Dk. III, Chap. CXLII.</p>
