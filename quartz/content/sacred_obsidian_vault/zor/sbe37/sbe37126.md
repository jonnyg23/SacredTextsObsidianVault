And like this, moreover, the resurrection, that is, the raising of the dead, <i>their</i> path, assembling, and dispersion, and the nature <i>and</i> circumstances of the resurrection, as to good doers and evildoers, through the gravity of every action which they perform as good <i>or</i> bad.</p>  
 <p>6. The name of the sixth is Nâdar <a name="fr_1698"></a><a href="#fn_1657"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and that is of thirty-five compilations which are sent down about the stars and the aspect and life of the sky. Also a description of the constellations, which are auspicious and which inauspicious, the method of these sciences and the operation of each one; whatever they say in sublime words, and whatever remains in this. They separate this from a book whose name in Arabic is Bavaf<i>t</i>âl <a name="fr_1699"></a><a href="#fn_1658"><font size="1">2</font></a> and is about the knowledge of the stars; and in Persian the name of that book is Favâmî<i>g</i>asân <a name="fr_1700"></a><a href="#fn_1659"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and they have made much more mention of the meaning of that, and of instruction of this kind for the moderns.</p>

And everything wise is in this book; and this is incumbent on all people that they learn this, and <i>it is</i> the same for all till the days of the guardian spirits; and every one who possesses knowledge seeks for this, and causes intercession by mankind, for the sake of the worthy, such as clothing <i>for</i> a righteous gift, so that <i>one</i> obtains recompense in the end from heaven; and it is necessary to give this clothing <i>for</i> a righteous gift to relations and the worthy.</p>

And these are about descriptions of kings and judges, and an investigation of their authority and their sufficiency; also the relations of a peasant with peasants, of a king with the kingdom, of judges with a judge, and whatever remains therein. Any actions that are for every nation, how they are ordered, and the option as to their species and nature; also whatever the people know, and the advantage <i>that</i> arises therefrom; besides the sins of people, deceit, telling lies, and whatever remains therein.</p>

The fourth portion is about the mansions of the world, agriculture, trimming trees, such as the date tree, and whatever remains thereof; the trouble and power of mankind and quadrupeds therefrom, and the obedience they exercise; they are the people to whom heedfulness is attributed, and whatever remains thereof; and the high-priests perform <i>their</i> duty by the law of the religion.

And this book is our reminder about the accounts of the apostle Zaratu<i>s</i>t by religious people, and whatever is the allotment of God, the exalted; about the false speaking of the people of the world, and about the goodness of the condition of the people of the world.
