 <p>1. The Spend <a name="fr_119"></a><a href="#fn_118"><font size="1">2</font></a> <i>contains</i> particulars about the origin <i>and</i> combination <i>of</i> the material <i>existence</i>, guardian spirit, <i>and</i> soul (nisman) of Zaratû<i>s</i>t; how the creation of each one <i>occurred</i> in the spiritual <i>existence</i>, and <i>in</i> what mode <i>it was</i> produced for the worldly <i>existence</i>; how <i>their</i> connection with the parents <i>arose</i>, the coming of the parents together, the combination in the mother, and the birth from the mother; <i>and</i> whatever is on the same subject. 2. Also about the arrival of both spirits, the good <i>one</i> for developing, and the evil <i>one</i> for destroying; the victory <i>of</i> the good spirit, and the rearing of Zaratû<i>s</i>t.</p>

 <p>occurrence of seven conferences in ten years. 4. Many marvels, owing to him, are published therein, just as there are <i>some</i> which, collected <i>and</i> selected, are noticed by the Dinka<i>r</i><i>d</i> manuscript <a name="fr_120"></a><a href="#fn_119"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>5. <i>In</i> seven sections (burînŏ), such as are called Spend, are the seven enquiries, <i>in</i> each instance a single enquiry; <i>and</i> the bestowal of the other Nasks, in these seven enquiries, <i>was</i> through speaking out in each one <i>of</i> the places of conference. 6. About the various enquiries, the period of the sitting <i>and</i> rising <i>on</i> each occasion, the nature of the sitting of the archangels, the coming forward of Zaratû<i>s</i>t to that domestic conclave (handêmânîh), his position <i>in</i> that place, what <i>there was</i> to say to him, <i>and</i> what <i>there was</i> to exhibit to him.</p>  
 <p>7. The conferring of the wisdom of omniscience upon Zaratû<i>s</i>t, and <i>what was</i> seen <i>by</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t <i>of</i> the past <i>and</i> future, and the perpetual amount of duration therein, through that wisdom <a name="fr_121"></a><a href="#fn_120"><font size="1">2</font></a>. 8. The existence of that wisdom, <i>and</i> what that is which, after <i>having</i> subsisted in it, is again well recognised; such as, owing to it, are the highest <i>and</i> best of places, heaven and the various grades of position <i>and</i> reward <i>of</i> the righteous, according to their worthiness through the practice of good works; the most downward and worst of places, hell and the place <i>of</i> punishment <i>of</i> the wicked, according to their sin; and, between the two, the place of the ever-stationary, those having equal good works <i>and</i></p>
