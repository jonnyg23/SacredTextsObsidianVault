 <p>It is doubtful how much of this Nask is still extant. Traditionally, the two fragments published by Westergaard as Yt. XXI, XXII (excepting XXII, 37-42), and by Haug as Hn. I, II, III, are said to belong to this Nask; but no allusion to Hn. II, III can be found in the account given in Dk. VIII, Chap. XLV, and Hn. I can be traced in that account only by assuming that the Ahunavair is therein mentioned (in § 1) instead of its accompanying Ashem-vohû, as it appears to be in Hn. I, 4. In Yt. XI we also appear to have a form of the Srôsh Ya<i>s</i>t derived from the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht Nask, or used in the liturgy when that Nask was recited, and this Ya<i>s</i>t likewise refers (in § 3) to the Ahunavair in similar terms to those used in Hn. I, 4.</p>  
 <p>Dk. VIII, Chap. XLV, 1, refers to the passage which contained the statement about the Ahunavair already mentioned and also thus quoted in Sls.</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> XII, 19:'It says in the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht that of the sayings which are spoken out the Ahunavair is that <i>which is</i> most triumphant.'</p>  
 <p>Dk. VIII, Chap. XLV, 4, refers to the passage which probably contained the statements thus quoted in the <i>Â</i>f<i>rî</i>n-i Gahanbâr, 14-19 (Sp.), concerning the righteous gifts to be given away, for the sake of the soul, at each of the six season-festivals:'There is an Avesta witness manifest in the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht from the passage (<i>in the case of the Maidhyô-zaremaya festival</i>): "Hazangrem maêshinãm daênunãm paitiputhranãm narãm ashaonãm ashaya vanghuya urunê para-daithyâ<i>d</i>, aêvahê hâtãm <i>k</i>inmânahê ya<i>d</i> ashahê vahi<i>s</i>tahê."' During the other five festivals the gifts, instead of ewes, are to be cows, mares, camels, and all kinds of herds and seeds, respectively, as appears from the corresponding passages. All six passages, mingled with further Avesta text, occur in several MSS. of the Âfrîngân-i Gahanbâr (see the earlier part of each section of Af. Gab. 7-12, ed. Geldner).</p>  
 <p>Dk. VIII, Chap. XLV, 9, probably refers to the passage which contained the statement thus quoted in Sd. XL, 4:'In the commentary of the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht it says:"Mâ âzârayôi<i>s</i>, Zarathu<i>s</i>tra! mâ Pourushaspem, mâ Dughdhovãm <a name="fr_1834"></a><a href="#fn_1784"><font size="1">1</font></a>, mâ aêthrapaiti<i>s</i>:It is not desirable that thou, O Zaratû<i>s</i>t! <i>shouldst</i> distress <i>thy</i> father, <i>or</i> mother, <i>or</i> priest."'</p>  
 <p>Dk. VIII, Chap. XLV, 10, may possibly refer to</p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_484"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 484</font></a></p>  
 <p>the passage which contained a statement that is often partially quoted in Pahlavi colophons, and the Avesta text of which constitutes Yas. LXXII, (Gld.); the first part of the statement, with a translation of its Pahlavi version, is here quoted from Mit<i>r</i>ô-<i>â</i>pân's colophon to a volume of miscellaneous Pahlavi texts, usually called the Vi<i>s</i>tâsp-shâhnâmak from the subject of its first text, and written A.D. 1322, in which the writer mentions the source from which he quotes; and the second part is taken from the same writer's colophon to the Yasna MS. K5, written thirteen months later, which is the only known authority for this part of the text:'In one passage of the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht it is declared that Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke to Zaratû<i>s</i>t thus:"Aêvô pa<i>n</i>t<i>a</i>u yô ashahê vispê anyaêshãm apantãm:one only is the way of righteousness, all those are no ways:angrahê mainy<i>e</i>us nasi<i>s</i>tãm <a name="fr_1835"></a><a href="#fn_1785"><font size="1">1</font></a> daênãm daêvayasnanãm parâ<i>g</i>îtîm ma<i>s</i><i>h</i>yânãm <a name="fr_1836"></a><a href="#fn_1786"><font size="1">2</font></a> frâkereitîm:which the evil spirit of the heretical demon-worshippers, the wizard, has forced on to mankind."'</p>  
 <p>Dk. VIII, Chap. XLV, 13, must refer to the passage which contained the statement thus mentioned in Sls. XIII, 10:'The fifteen stanzas of Yâ-<i>s</i><i>h</i>yaothanâ <a name="fr_1837"></a><a href="#fn_1787"><font size="1">3</font></a> are for this reason, because it is given for the destruction of those fifteen fiends who are declared in the medical part of the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht.'</p>  
 <p>No allusion to the following seven passages, quoted from this Nask, has been noticed in Dk. VIII, Chap. XLV:</p>  
 <p>In Sls. XII, 30, it is stated that 'in the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht</p>

 <p><a name="page_485"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 485</font></a></p>  
 <p>it says that a woman who shall be reverent is to be considered as much as she who is suitable.'</p>  
 <p>In Sls. XIII, 6, it is said that 'the twenty-two stanzas of Tâ-v<i>e</i>-urvâtâ <a name="fr_1838"></a><a href="#fn_1788"><font size="1">1</font></a> are the twenty-two judgments of which it speaks in the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht thus: "Anaomô mananghê daya vîspâi kva, kva parô?Lodging in the judge, that while <i>he has</i> twenty-two judgments <i>he may be</i> more just."'</p>  
 <p>In Sd. XXII, 3, 4, it is stated that 'in the commentary of the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht it says, that every one who performs intercession, and extracts anything from a person on their account, and conveys <i>it</i> to them is as much without dishonesty towards them, as he who may have given to them out of his own property. And <i>in</i> the spiritual <i>existence</i> they take account of that profit for him, and just as they make <i>out</i> the account of the good work of that person who may have given <i>it</i>, even so much is his good work.'</p>  
 <p>In Vi<i>g</i>. p. 12, it is said, with reference to Aharman, '<i>that</i> he is a creature <i>of</i> Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is manifest from the Avesta <i>of</i> the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht: "Dâta, Ahura spe<i>n</i>ta! Mazd<i>a</i>u."'</p>  
 <p>In Vi<i>g</i>. pp. 23-25, it is said that, 'if any one passes away from the bodily existence, as much of his wealth comes to his son, wife, and daughter as is declared by the Avesta <i>of</i> the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht <a name="fr_1839"></a><a href="#fn_1789"><font size="1">2</font></a>:"Âa<i>d</i> yêzi avi hê anguhê astvai<i>n</i>ti, Spitama Zarathu<i>s</i>tra!So if in that bodily existence, <i>O</i> Spîtâmân Zaratû<i>s</i>t!narãm vâ nâirinãm vâ para-irithyâ<i>d</i>,<i>of</i> males or</p>

 <p>In Vi;. p. 83, it is said that 'hair from an ox <i>or</i> a horse is suitable, as <i>it</i> is declared by the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht: "G<i>e</i>us vâ aspahê vâ varesa."'</p>  
 <p>In Vi<i>g</i>. pp. 144, 145, it is said, with reference to announcing the name of the deceased during the celebration of the Srôsh Ya<i>s</i>t after a death, that '<i>it is</i> declared by the Avesta of the Hâ<i>d</i>ôkht: "Yêzi narô mazdayasnô ha<i>k</i>a gaêthâbyô parairithyêiti, âa<i>d</i> hê nãma hadha pitô frag<i>e</i>urvayâ<i>d</i>; yêzi nâirika para-irithyêiti, âa<i>d</i> ya<i>d</i> hê nãma hadha pathanô uzg<i>e</i>urvayâ<i>d</i>, Spitama Zarathu<i>s</i>tra! aêtem vâ<i>k</i>em nî a<i>n</i>tare mazdayasnanãm frasastayâ<i>d</i>:If a man who is a Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipper passes away from the worldly <i>existence</i>, in such <i>a case one</i> holds out his name with <i>that of</i> his father; and if <i>it be</i> a woman who passes away, in such <i>a case one</i> upholds whatever is her name with <i>that of</i> her husband, O Spîtâmân Zaratû<i>s</i>t! <i>one</i> shall further bless this statement (that is, <i>its being</i> reverenced is important) among the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, (do thou proclaim and further bless this statement)."'</p>
