 <p>1. The eighth fargar<i>d</i>, <i>H</i><i>v</i>aêtumaiti <a name="fr_1330"></a><a href="#fn_1302"><font size="1">3</font></a>, is <i>that</i> by him who teaches wisdom to others the not being deceived by an apostate into confusing a righteous <i>one</i> (aharûbŏ-barî<i>s</i>îh) is also taught <a name="fr_1331"></a><a href="#fn_1303"><font size="1">4</font></a>; even for this reason, because he who <i>has</i> taught is not deceived.</p>

 <p>2. This, too, that by him who is as reverent <i>unto</i> Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> as a daughter <i>unto</i> a father, and who is also a gratifier of virtuous doers, Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i> <a name="fr_1332"></a><a href="#fn_1304"><font size="1">1</font></a> is <i>made one</i> of the archangels, and one is also made to love <i>her;</i> even for this reason, because through that Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i>ic <i>one being</i> reverent <i>unto</i> Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, and the gratification of the good <i>by</i> him, the archangels love and preserve her Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i>ic nature (Spenda<i>r</i>ma<i>d</i>îgîh). 3. This, too, that he who is loving Vohûman is taught by his wisdom not to destroy (nasânînî<i>d</i>a<i>n</i>ŏ) <a name="fr_1333"></a><a href="#fn_1305"><font size="1">2</font></a> the religion of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; even for this reason, because wisdom maintains the religion in virtue, and others are taught about it.</p>  
 <p>4. This, too, that by him who gives <i>him</i>self in discipleship unto the priests, <i>and</i> who asks again that which he does not understand, learning (âmûkŏ) is taught; even for this reason, because the asking for knowledge again <i>by him</i> who <i>has</i> given <i>him</i>self in discipleship to a wise priest, increases knowledge; and the friends of knowledge, therefore, make him an example, and shall practise asking again, that which they do not understand, <i>from</i> the disciples of the priests.</p>  
 <p>5. This, too, that whoever is <i>in accordance</i> with Zaratû<i>s</i>t, through pure affection, becomes, in like manner, <i>him</i> who is giving strength <i>to</i> the will of the archangels and the commands <i>of</i> the good; even for this reason, because these two capabilities <i>are</i> of the special nature of Zaratû<i>s</i>t. 6. This, too, that through the discrimination of him who loves <a name="fr_1334"></a><a href="#fn_1306"><font size="1">3</font></a> Vohûman Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i></p>

 <p><a name="page_342"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 342</font></a></p>  
 <p>is gratified; even for this reason, because <i>one</i> loving Vohûman is loving wisdom and <i>has</i> taught wisdom, wisdom taught is discrimination, and the discriminator becomes a gratifier of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>.</p>  
 <p>7. This, too, that whoever gives thought to the religion of Zaratû<i>s</i>t is taught wisdom; even for this reason, because all the wisdom of the good religion is taught to him by giving thought. 8. This, too, that whoever <i>has</i> kept wealth in the control <a name="fr_1335"></a><a href="#fn_1307"><font size="1">1</font></a> of Zaratû<i>s</i>t becomes taught, <i>and</i> is <i>one</i> who is reverent <i>to</i> the benefiters; even for this reason, because whoever is reverent <i>to</i> the supporters of religion keeps wealth in the control <i>of</i> the supporters of religion, <i>and</i>, when kept by him in their control, it is kept by him in that of Zaratû<i>s</i>t.</p>  
 <p>9. This, too, that his destiny is connected with himself who practises industry. 10. This, too, that his good works <i>for</i> arranging the creation become his own who has fully prepared his own person.</p>  
 <p>11. The excellence <i>of</i> righteousness is perfect.</p>
