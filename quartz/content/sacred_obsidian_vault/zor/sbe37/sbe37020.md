 <p>1. The second section is the Zatamistân ('<i>assault code</i>'), particulars about assault (zatam) and the annoyances (vêshîgânŏ) from assault, such as pain, blood, and unconsciousness; <i>also</i> the sin <a name="fr_140"></a><a href="#fn_139"><font size="1">1</font></a> that a man may commit in a state of unconsciousness. 2. About the seven kinds of symptoms of unconsciousness, and separate decisions about assaults that adults may commit among those who are children; also as regards an assault which proceeds to pain <i>and</i> blood, and as regards that <i>in</i> which the duration of the disposition of wrath abates the pain <i>and</i> blood.</p>  
 <p>3. About begging (khvahî<i>s</i>nŏ) <i>and</i> beneficence (hû-dahî<i>s</i>nŏ) <a name="fr_141"></a><a href="#fn_140"><font size="1">2</font></a>, such as those of which one says in particular <i>there</i> are four species: when stinginess (pû<i>s</i>îh) benefits pride (pîkŏ), when pride benefits stinginess, when stinginess benefits stinginess, and when pride benefits pride; and <i>there</i> are three other species that originate from these <i>last</i> two, in consultation together, when stinginess and pride benefit stinginess and pride, when stinginess and pride benefit stinginess, and when stinginess and pride benefit pride, <i>all</i> which, <i>together</i>, constitute the seven primary species; many others, too, are traced back to these. 4. Also about seeing the depravity (khang</p>

 <p>dî<i>d</i>anŏ) of a perverting member of the community (kastâr dâhm) and of the perverter of a member of the community, and whatever is on the same subject.</p>  
 <p>5. About a weapon seizable, and a weapon one brings, there is this, namely, what is the thing which is imperfect (anas<i>p</i>ôrîk) as a weapon, what is that which is not, and what is that which is welcome as a weapon; what is that which, when any one forces it back at any one as a weapon, is itself something annoying to him; what is his natural annoyance and what his imparted; and the penalty in property and difference of sentence on a man who is carrying a weapon, due to any weapon he has to carry away.</p>  
 <p>6. About the six modes of engaging in conflict: through assault, tumult (khva<i>s</i>i<i>s</i>nŏ) <a name="fr_142"></a><a href="#fn_141"><font size="1">1</font></a>, false teaching (mîtôk-sâstô) <a name="fr_143"></a><a href="#fn_142"><font size="1">2</font></a>, giving no food (atapdâ<i>d</i>ŏ) <a name="fr_144"></a><a href="#fn_143"><font size="1">3</font></a>, speaking with wizard's spells <a name="fr_145"></a><a href="#fn_144"><font size="1">4</font></a>, and speaking with threats of danger <a name="fr_146"></a><a href="#fn_145"><font size="1">5</font></a>; and, where there is an engaging</p>

 <p>in conflict, it then occurs when <i>one has</i> stood up for beginning <i>it</i> and the assault is committed, <i>on</i> one by the other, <i>and</i> not before. 7. And this, too, that engaging in conflict occurs <i>as regards</i> adult with adult, childless women with childless women, pregnant women with pregnant women, and children of seven years with children of seven years<i>but</i>, as regards children of seven years in sight of <i>their</i> fathers, it becomes an engaging in conflict of the fathersand the decision about it is this, that the atonement for every sin which may be committed through engaging in conflict goes to the priestly authorities.</p>  
 <p>8. About the affliction <i>of</i> a pure lord who sees any one <i>who</i> has been useless (abûn) unto <i>his</i> slave, though the slave is beseeching, and does not contend for <i>his</i> ownership. 9. About sin <i>affecting</i> accusers <a name="fr_147"></a><a href="#fn_146"><font size="1">1</font></a> not being atoned for by any other good work, except unto the accuser himself; <i>also</i> about the slaying of a servant together with <i>his</i> lord, <i>and</i> whatever is on the same subject.</p>  
 <p>To. About slaying <i>by</i> untaught children of seven years, <i>or</i> even of eight years in sight of <i>their</i> fathers; <i>and</i> the criminality of the fathers therein, when <i>it</i> is possible for them to hinder <i>it and</i> they do not hinder <i>it</i>, and when <i>it</i> is not possible for them to hinder <i>it</i>.</p>
