 <p>1. The twelfth fargar<i>d</i>, U<i>s</i>tavaiti <a name="fr_591"></a><a href="#fn_586"><font size="1">2</font></a>, is about the exaltation of Zaratû<i>s</i>t through the satisfaction of water, and the hope of all creatures for him. 2. And about the impure recitation of a text, when <a name="fr_592"></a><a href="#fn_587"><font size="1">3</font></a> the text is not uttered by a high-priest. 3. This, too, that the text which a man who is corrupted may</p>

 <p>offer is an impropriety (adînâîh) for that which is an uncorrupted place. 4. This, too, is declared, that a greedy man whose belly is filled by accumulationand the end of every sin is, to him, only for the gratification of the body<i>one</i> considers just like a gallows to which <i>there</i> is a foundation (<i>s</i>îpŏ) of every impurity. 5. This, too, that a bird (vâê) practises that habit (<i>s</i>ân) even that it kills those outright which have become large in <i>our</i> midst, which are the serpents produced by the demons. 6. This, too, that <i>for</i> invocation (azbâyi<i>s</i>nŏ) of the sacred beings thinking with speaking, speaking with acting, and acting without deceitfulness are effectual.</p>  
 <p>7. About the pure goodness of the archangels, and the union of their thoughts, words, <i>and</i> deeds together; their bountifulness, nurturing, and protection are the cause <a name="fr_593"></a><a href="#fn_588"><font size="1">1</font></a> of the prosperity of the world. 8. About the production of Zaratû<i>s</i>t <i>by</i> Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> with a goodness like his own. 9. This, too, that whoever gives anything to the disciples of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, his reward and recompense are just as though the thing had been given by him to Zaratû<i>s</i>t <a name="fr_594"></a><a href="#fn_589"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>10. It is perfect excellence <i>that is</i> righteousness.</p>
