 <p>and the disposition and life of the sky. [<i>&amp;c., very nearly the same as in II</i>, 6 <i>to</i>] Bavaf<i>t</i>âl, and in Persian the name of that book is Favâmsa'hân, that is, instruction arises therefrom for the moderns.</p>

The name of the tenth book is Ka<i>s</i>kanîz, <i>and</i> that is of sixty subdivisions, about the advantage (faʓl) of natural wisdom and knowledge <i>as distinguished</i> from acquired knowledge, that is, the knowledge born from the mother, and the knowledge which they learn <i>by</i> instruction; doctrine about purity and truth, and anything [<i>&amp;c., as in II</i>, 10, <i>to</i>] how it occurs.</p>

 <p><a name="page_435"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 435</font></a></p>  
 <p>and that is of sixty compilations, <i>but</i> after the calamity of Alexander, when they sought <i>them</i> again, they found no more <i>than</i> eight subdivisions, and those are about Gu<i>s</i>tâsp's acceptance [<i>&amp;c., as in II</i>, 11].</p>  
 <p>13. The name of the twelfth book is <i>H</i>as t, <i>and</i> that is of twenty-two fargar<i>d</i>s in six portions. The first portion is about knowing the Lord, may he be honoured and glorified! and faith in the mission of Zaratu<i>s</i>t and any duties which are ordered in a book of the religion. The second portion is about the obedience of kings, the truth of the religion, and complying <i>with</i> commands. The third portion is about the promise <i>to</i> benefactors and their recompense, the punishment of evildoers, and escaping from hell.

 <p>14. The name of the thirteenth book is Sfend, <i>and</i> that is of sixty subdivisions, for the information of people who are in want of it, and for their knowledge; also for any persons who become covetous as to virtuous actions, <i>and</i> proceed after the footsteps of the learned and people of religion, and receive advantage therefrom; and as reminders of the celestial sphere that there is advantage from the daily practice of them. Also about the accounts of the evil of mankind, by the apostle Zaratu<i>s</i>t, about the false speaking [<i>&amp;c., as in II</i>, 13].</p>  
 <p>15. The fourteenth Nask is the <i>G</i>ira<i>s</i>t, <i>and</i> that</p>  
 <p><a name="page_436"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 436</font></a></p>  
 <p>is of twenty-two subdivisions, for the understanding of the causes of mankind [<i>&amp;c., as in II</i>, 14.].</p>  
 <p>16. The name of the fifteenth book is Baghân-ya<i>s</i>t, and that is of seventeen subdivisions, in praise of the Lord, the praiseworthy <i>and</i> exalted, and the admitted angels; also thanksgiving <i>for</i> the favours due to that which he makes expedient in the religion, and the thanksgiving <i>for</i> his favour <i>lasts</i> until <i>one</i> obtains <i>it</i> back in the end; likewise the appearance of the angels, and these are nobles for the praise of the sacred being.</p>  
 <p>17. The name of the sixteenth book is Niyâram, and that is of fifty-four subdivisions, about decrees <i>as to</i> riches, bringing abroad, and whatever is made lawful; obtaining deliverance from hell, performing service, slavery, and the nature of wayfarers; whatever is in the thoughts of mankind, and whatever is in the bodies of mankind.</p>

 <p>19. The name of the eighteenth Nask is Duvâsrôb, and that is of sixty-five subdivisions, about robbers (duvâyân?) of human beings [<i>&amp;c., very nearly the same as in II</i>, 18].</p>  
 <p>20. The name of the nineteenth Nask is Askâram, and that is of fifty-two fargar<i>d</i>s [<i>&amp;c., very nearly the same as in II</i>, 19].</p>  
 <p>21. The name of the twentieth Nask is Vîndâd, <i>and</i> that is of twenty-two subdivisions [<i>&amp;c., very nearly the same as in II</i>, 20]. And <i>as to</i> this book Vîndâd, which is the twentieth book of the Nasks, out of the twenty-one Nasks of the Avesta, we and you are now using <i>it</i> in the ceremonial, and when,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_437"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 437</font></a></p>  
 <p>after the calamity of Alexander, they sought for the books again, they found a portion of each Nask, <i>but</i> did not find any Nask in completeness except the Vîndâd which they found complete.</p>  
 <p>22. The name of the twenty-first Nask is Hâdokht, <i>and</i> that is of thirty subdivisions, about the manner of bringing together and the many miracles, and <i>their</i> excellences <i>and</i> connections; and in this book the accursed devil becomes cursed and becomes annihilated.</p>  
 <p>23. At present, since the Nasks <i>have</i> not remained perfect in the midst <i>of us</i>, it is not possible to solemnize <i>them</i>, because Alexander the Rûman <a name="fr_1725"></a><a href="#fn_1684"><font size="1">1</font></a> carried off a rough draft, in Rûman characters, of those of the twenty-one Nasks of the Avesta which were <i>about</i> the stars and medicine, and repeatedly burnt the books of the Avesta, so that the soul of Alexander burns in hell; and after his calamity, every one of the high-priests, in council together, preserved something of the Avesta in <i>his</i> mind, <i>and</i> the aggregate <i>has</i> disclosed the books of the Yasna (ya<i>s</i>t), Vîsperad, Vendîdâd, Fravash, Khûrdah Avesta, Darûn, Âfrîngân, <i>K</i>îdah Va<i>g</i>arkardan, and Bundahi<i>s</i>, <i>which</i> they wrote correctly; <i>as to</i> the remainder (tatammah) which they did not write, it was on this account, that they did not preserve <i>it</i> correctly in <i>their</i> minds. And the expectation, descended from the midst <i>of them</i> in the court of Ormazd and the archangels, is thus, that Var<i>g</i>âvand, Peshôtan, and Hushêdar <a name="fr_1726"></a><a href="#fn_1685"><font size="1">2</font></a> <i>will</i> arrive in haste <i>for</i> the manifestation of the religion, and the goodness</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_438"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 438</font></a></p>  
 <p>of the religion again assumes splendour from a new head; the good and those of the good religion become cheerful and happy, and the bad and wicked become extinct and disappearing. Amen.</p>
