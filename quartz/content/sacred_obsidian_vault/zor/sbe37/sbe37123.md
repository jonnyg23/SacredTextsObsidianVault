 <p>1. About the purport of the evidence <i>of</i> the three codes of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipping religion, one as regards the other, there is verbal evidence of the Gâthic from the Hadha-mãthric and the Law, and about the Hadha-mãthric and the Law from the Gâthas. 2. The purport, too, of the statement <i>that</i> occurs is this of a ruler putting aside the commands of an enemywhich are declared, <i>in</i> many passages (dîvâk) of the Hadha-mãthric and even of the Legal, <i>to be</i> worthiness of deaththe purport <i>being</i> in the words of a Gâthic phrase (nisang) <i>that</i> is</p>

 <p>even this:'He who is a good ruler is a desire <i>and</i> bringing on of fortune for me (va<i>l</i>am) <a name="fr_1654"></a><a href="#fn_1613"><font size="1">1</font></a>.' 3. All rulers also for the world have arisen <i>for</i> their own, and for maintaining him who is high-priest; they are submissive, and <i>any one</i> accomplishing their commandswhich are putting aside the commands of their enemyis, owing to their submissiveness, authorisedly maintaining his own person and wealth <i>in</i> the world thereby, <i>and</i> in the world there is no place, <i>nor</i> yet a share of anything therefrom, on account of which he becomes offended by the world.</p>  
 <p>4 The evidence of the Hadha-mãthric and of the Legal about a Gâthic statement is the purport <i>of</i> these words in a Gâthic phrase, that 'not <i>for</i> him who is rightly proceeding is <i>there</i> further ruin <a name="fr_1655"></a><a href="#fn_1614"><font size="1">2</font></a>;' <i>and</i> the evidence from the Hadha-mãthric is even this which states that 'rectitude assists a man like a regiment a thousand strong <a name="fr_1656"></a><a href="#fn_1615"><font size="1">3</font></a>;' also for the proportion of rectitude in <i>his</i> possession there is no disturbance whatever, and from the hurtful (vinâsîgânŏ) from without <i>he</i> is thus protected, because fully-worshipping (pûr-y<i>a</i><i>z</i>ân) performance is freedom from danger from the want of freedom from wickedness (<i>a</i>-adarvandîh) of the enemy, as regards benefit, through the doing of injury by him.</p>  
 <p>5. And on account of the superior knowledge of the spiritual <i>existence</i>, moreover, for the Gâthas, above the intermediate Hadha-mãthric <i>and</i> the lower knowledge of the Law, the purpose of the Gâthic <i>was</i> for the statements of the Legal <i>and</i> the <i>Hadha-</i>mãthric, and the provision of the Hadha-mãthric</p>

In the seventh book of the Dinka<i>r</i><i>d</i> it is stated that as regards the high-priests this, too, is said on the subject of <i>S</i>ênôv, that one hundred years of the religion elapse when <i>S</i>ênôv is born, and two hundred years when he passes away; he was also the first Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshipper with a life of a hundred years (100 khayâ), and who walks forth upon this earth with a hundred disciples.' This last clause clearly identifies him with the 'Saêna, <i>son</i> of Ahûm-stu<i>d</i>, who first appeared upon this earth with a hundred pupils,' as stated in Yt. XIII, 97 (see Darmesteter, <i>Textes pehlvis relatifs au Judaisme</i>, première partie, p. 3, n. 2).</p>
