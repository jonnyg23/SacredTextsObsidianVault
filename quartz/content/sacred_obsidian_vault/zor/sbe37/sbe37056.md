And this, too, that thou shouldst eat that which is your food where <i>there is</i> a suitable place. 10. And where <i>it is</i> eaten by thee it should be lightly, it should not be heavily, so that, when <i>it is</i> eaten by thee, a good work is performed, and <i>there is</i> abstinence from sin. 11. And, so that what thou eatest shall be immortally joyful to thee, where <i>there are</i> poor, provide <i>them</i> a share, and the poor <i>will</i> bless thee; and, <i>as to</i> a poor <i>man</i> who is righteous, the opinion is <i>that</i> his blessing is best.</p>
