 <p>Dk. IX, Chaps. X LVII-XLIX, describe the contents of the first three fargar<i>d</i>s of this Nask, which are still extant in the Avesta text of Yas. XIXXXI, whose Pahlavi version may be translated as follows:</p>  <h4 align="center">Pahl. Yas. XIX = Bakŏ I.</h4>  
 <p>The beginning of the Ahunavair of the Bakân <a name="fr_1735"></a><a href="#fn_1694"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>1. Zaratû<i>s</i>t enquired of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> thus: 'O Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, <a name="fr_1736"></a><a href="#fn_1695"><font size="1">3</font></a> propitious spirit, creator of the world of embodied existences, <i>and</i> righteous <a name="fr_1737"></a><a href="#fn_1696"><font size="1">4</font></a>! (2) which were those words, O Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>! that <i>were</i> spoken by thee for me, (3) before the sky, before the water, before the earth, before the (well-yielding) cattle, before the plants, before the fire which is Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>'s</p>

 <p>son, before the righteous man (Gâyômar<i>d</i>), before the demons, (who remain) noxious creatures <a name="fr_1738"></a><a href="#fn_1697"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and mankind, before, all embodied existence (the creation of sovereignty), <i>and</i> before all the excellence created by Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, (which is owing to) the manifestation of righteousness?'</p>  
 <p>4. And Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: They were the apportionment of the Ahunavair, <i>O</i> Spîtâmân Zaratû<i>s</i>t! (that spirit who would make the religion current, who has formed that religion from the Ahunavair) which was spoken out by me for thee; (5) (that is,) before the sky, (<i>&amp;c., as in</i> § 3).</p>  
 <p>6. Whoever chants that apportionment of the Ahunavair, <i>O</i> Spîtâmân Zaratû<i>s</i>t! without talking (that is, he does not speak out in the middle of any of its difficult Avesta <a name="fr_1739"></a><a href="#fn_1698"><font size="1">2</font></a>) <i>and</i> not without anxiety (that he <i>may</i> slumber), (7) <i>it is</i> like a hundred above any other authority of those of the Gâthas, when <i>one</i> chants <i>them</i> without talking, <i>or</i> not without anxiety <a name="fr_1740"></a><a href="#fn_1699"><font size="1">3</font></a>; (thus it becomes <i>fit</i> for the ceremonial). 8. Whoever chants <i>it</i> while talking, <i>or</i> without anxiety, (thus it becomes <i>fit</i> for the ceremonial,) <i>it is</i> like ten above any other authority of those of the Gâthas.</p>  
 <p>9. Whoever in that embodied existence of mine, <i>O</i> Spîtâmân Zaratû<i>s</i>t! recalls the apportionment of</p>

 <p>the Ahunavair, (that is, seeks for <i>it</i>,) and, further, mutters that which he recalls, (that is, shall accomplish <i>it</i> easily,) and, further, chants that which he mutters, (that is, fully understands its ritual,) and, further, reverences that which is chanted, (that is, shall celebrate the ceremony,) (10) his soul I pass on to the best existence, three times over the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge, I who am Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, (that is, on that day <i>in</i> which he shall faithfully  <a name="fr_1741"></a><a href="#fn_1700"><font size="1">1</font></a> provide the ceremony, it shall <a name="fr_1742"></a><a href="#fn_1701"><font size="1">2</font></a> lead his soul three times unto <i>the world</i> yonder, and shall <a name="fr_1743"></a><a href="#fn_1701"><font size="1">2</font></a> cause its happiness therein) (11) to the best existence, the best righteousness, and the best light. 12. Also whoever in that embodied existence of mine, <i>O</i> Spîtâmân Zaratû<i>s</i>t! mutters the apportionment of the Ahunavair, (that is, shall accomplish <i>it</i> easily,) <i>and</i> drops <a name="fr_1744"></a><a href="#fn_1702"><font size="1">3</font></a>, (that is, cuts off <a name="fr_1745"></a><a href="#fn_1703"><font size="1">4</font></a>) (13) either <a name="fr_1746"></a><a href="#fn_1704"><font size="1">5</font></a> as much as a half, or as much as a third, or as much as a fourth, or as much as a fifth, (at a fifth the foundation <i>of the sin</i> is laid, at a half it becomes quite complete, and when he shall cut off the whole <i>it is</i> a Tanâpûhar <a name="fr_1747"></a><a href="#fn_1705"><font size="1">6</font></a> <i>sin</i>,) (14) I twirl <a name="fr_1748"></a><a href="#fn_1706"><font size="1">7</font></a> away the soul of him, I who am Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, from the best existence, (that is, I. would put it out;) (15) to such an extent and width is the twirling away as <i>that of</i> this earth, <i>and</i> even so the extent of this earth is as much as its width.</p>  
 <p>16. This saying is proclaimed (a revelation) possessing</p>

 <p>an Ahu <i>and</i> possessing a Ratu, (from which this is manifest, namely, the possession of a ruler and high-priest. 17. This, too, is said, that it was) before that sky <i>was</i> created, before the water, before the earth, before the plants, (18) before the creation of the four-legged ox (which <i>was</i> the sole-created ox), (19) before the creation of the two-legged righteous man (who <i>was</i> Gâyômar<i>d</i>), (20) <i>and</i> before that sun of definite form (the body of the sun) <i>was</i> created as an acquirement of the archangels. 21. It <i>was</i> (likewise) proclaimed to me by the spirituality of propitiousness, (it likewise became possible for the spirituality of propitiousness to say (22) <i>what was</i> said <a name="fr_1749"></a><a href="#fn_1707"><font size="1">1</font></a> to Zaratû<i>s</i>t,) concerning the whole material existence of the righteous who are, who have been, and who <i>will</i> arise, (23) as to the progress of work, (that is, while they shall perform for it that which is specified by it, and good works shall arise through them,) <i>that</i> this work, among the living, is for Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, (that is, that which they may perform, suitable for Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, they shall so perform as is declared by this fargar<i>d</i>).</p>  
 <p>24. This, too, is the most expressive (most in effect) of those statements which <i>were</i> ever spoken forth (till now), <i>or which one</i> speaks forth (at present) <a name="fr_1750"></a><a href="#fn_1708"><font size="1">2</font></a>, <i>or shall</i> speak forth <a name="fr_1751"></a><a href="#fn_1709"><font size="1">3</font></a> (even henceforth); (25) for it is <i>through</i> such a statement (such in effect) as that, <i>if</i> the whole embodied existence (26) learnt it <i>and</i>, having learnt <a name="fr_1752"></a><a href="#fn_1710"><font size="1">4</font></a>, (that is, they shall accomplish <i>it</i> easily,) they retain <i>it</i>, (that is, they</p>

 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_457"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 457</font></a></p>  
 <p>should rely upon it,) abstinence from passing <i>away</i> would be quite masterful, (that is, they become immortal). 27. This, too, is our saying spoken forth, (preserved <a name="fr_1753"></a><a href="#fn_1711"><font size="1">1</font></a> among the revelation mentioned <i>n</i> this <a name="fr_1754"></a><a href="#fn_1712"><font size="1">2</font></a> fargar<i>d</i>,) which is learnt, (that is, they shall accomplish it easily,) and <i>one</i> recites, (that is, he utters it in a ceremonial,) thus <i>for</i> any one whatever of the beings whose righteousness is best, (that is, should he do it for a ceremonial, he becomes <i>fit</i> for it; it is when he utters this in a ceremonial <i>that</i> his soul becomes immortal).</p>  
 <p>28. As <i>it is</i> here spoken forth, (that a ruler and high-priest are to be maintained; as these things are so spoken, <i>and</i> as this law is so) (29) even when it gives him an Ahu and a Ratu, (that is, it gives up <i>his</i> person to the priestly assembly,) so it is thereby taught to him <i>that</i> the thought of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is the creature <i>with</i> the first thinking, (that is, the Gâthic lore is set going by him ) (30) whatever teaches <a name="fr_1755"></a><a href="#fn_1713"><font size="1">3</font></a> this (is the person of him who is king of kings, who) is the greatest (of men) of every description <a name="fr_1756"></a><a href="#fn_1714"><font size="1">4</font></a>, (that is, it possesses <a name="fr_1757"></a><a href="#fn_1713"><font size="1">3</font></a> a person in the king of kings ) <i>and</i> so it is taught <i>that</i> the creatures <a name="fr_1758"></a><a href="#fn_1715"><font size="1">5</font></a> are for him, (where the Gâthic lore is set going by him).</p>  
 <p>31. Whatever is a good emanation for <a name="fr_1759"></a><a href="#fn_1713"><font size="1">3</font></a> Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, (that is, has an origin in his personality,) is through <i>the word</i> vangh<i>e</i>u<i>s</i>, (which in the division becomes the beginning of) the third assertion here, whose recital is 'he gives through Vohûman,' (that is, the recitation which he utters properly is accomplished by him,) and, besides, here is that which</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Vohûman has taught, (that is, the reward and recompense which they give Vohûman, they attribute also to him;) (32) whatever <a name="fr_1760"></a><a href="#fn_1716"><font size="1">1</font></a> is a further indication by Vohûman, (that is, anything which he may accomplish <a name="fr_1761"></a><a href="#fn_1716"><font size="1">1</font></a> properly as a token, and is performed by him,) became so through this summing up (that is, its end occurred) in <i>s</i><i>h</i>yaothananãm; (33) here among the existences was the summing up <a name="fr_1762"></a><a href="#fn_1717"><font size="1">2</font></a>, (that is, it was its end).</p>  
 <p>34. What it teaches to the creatures <a name="fr_1763"></a><a href="#fn_1718"><font size="1">3</font></a> of him who is Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, is thus: he <i>who is</i> like him is he who is his own creature <a name="fr_1764"></a><a href="#fn_1718"><font size="1">3</font></a>, (that is, even these people it tells something so, <i>and</i> thus <a name="fr_1765"></a><a href="#fn_1716"><font size="1">1</font></a> they attain again, through purity, to the possession of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, just as Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> produced <i>them</i> through purity). 35. <i>By</i> 'the dominion is for Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>' it has taught, that he has made Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> his ruler <a name="fr_1766"></a><a href="#fn_1719"><font size="1">4</font></a>, over his own person, (who shall perform that which is revealed by the Avesta ) and this is taught, <i>that</i> through him is the ministration of the poor, (that is, happiness is thereby caused by him,) (36) which is friendship <i>for</i> the Spîtâmân; (and the religion of the Spîtâmân became) <i>these</i> five assertions, (that is, the decrees in it were five,) (37) <i>which</i> were the</p>

 <p>whole enunciation of the saying, <i>and</i> the whole saying was that of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> <a name="fr_1767"></a><a href="#fn_1720"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>38. For the sake of development Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, (for cherishing the creatures,) pronounced the Ahunavair, and in its development <i>there</i> was a summing up, (that is, its end occurred). 39. Quickly, when <a name="fr_1768"></a><a href="#fn_1721"><font size="1">2</font></a> destruction arose, (that is <a name="fr_1769"></a><a href="#fn_1722"><font size="1">3</font></a>, the destroyer,) <i>and</i> rushed in, even among the wicked he uttered (as resistance) (40) this interdict:(41) 'Neither our thoughts, nor <a name="fr_1770"></a><a href="#fn_1722"><font size="1">3</font></a> teachings, (<i>as</i> I have not taught that which thou hast taught,) nor wisdoms, (for I consider wisdom as virtuousness, and thou considerest <i>it</i> as viciousness,) (42) nor wills, (for my will is a virtuous wish, and thine a vicious <i>one</i>,) nor words, (for I speak that which is virtuous, and thou speakest that which is vicious) nor actions, (for my actions are virtuous, and thine are vicious,) (43) nor religions, (for my religion is the Gâthic lore, and thine is witchcraft,) nor souls are themselves in unison, (for <i>as to</i> those who rely upon my things, and those who rely upon thy things, their souls are not in one place;' he who said this, that even their souls exist, must thus say that <i>they are</i> not souls in unison <i>with</i> ours).</p>  
 <p>44. Also this saying, which Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> uttered, <i>has</i> the three degrees, the four classes, (priest, warrior, husbandman, and artisan) the five chieftainships, (house-ruler, village-ruler, tribe-ruler, province-ruler,</p>

 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_460"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 460</font></a></p>  
 <p>and supreme Zaratû<i>s</i>t,) and its summing up is with liberality, (thus it is possible to make <i>it</i> completely for their own, when they deliver themselves up to the priests). 45. Which are the degrees of it? Good thoughts, good words, and good deeds; (they are <a name="fr_1771"></a><a href="#fn_1723"><font size="1">1</font></a>, indeed, virtuous among the degrees of religion). 46. Which are the classes? The priest, warrior, husbandman, and artisan, (47) who are the whole day <i>and</i> night with a righteous man, who are thinking rightly, speaking rightly, and acting rightly, (48) who <i>have</i> recognised a priestly authority, (that is, possess a high-priest,) who <i>have</i> taught the religion, (that is, have provided a ceremony,) (49) <i>and</i> who, through their actions, are a furtherance of the world of righteousness, (owing to the work they accomplish). 50. Which are the chiefs? The house-ruler, village-ruler, tribe-ruler, province-ruler, and the Zaratû<i>s</i>t is the fifth (51) <i>in</i> those provinces which are other than the Ragha <a name="fr_1772"></a><a href="#fn_1724"><font size="1">2</font></a> of Zaratû<i>s</i>t; <i>with</i> four chieftainships is the Ragha of Zaratû<i>s</i>t. 52. Which are the chiefs of that? The house-ruler, village-ruler, tribe-ruler, and the Zaratû<i>s</i>t is the fourth; (that is, when he was in his own province, he also produced its period <i>of prosperity</i>, who arises fourth).</p>  
 <p>53. How <i>was it</i> when through good thought, (that is, the religion remained in the degree of good thought)? When it arose first in a righteous thinker, (it arose in Gâyômar<i>d</i>, and he thought for it). 54. How, when through good words? When <i>it was</i> the bounteous text, (doing good). 55. How,</p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_461"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 461</font></a></p>  
 <p>when through good deeds? When <i>it was</i> the praise even of righteousness <i>by</i> the first creature, (that is, they shall perform the ceremonial, and also other good works, through the Gâtha lore).</p>  
 <p>56. Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> proclaimed; for what <i>was it</i> proclaimed by him? For the righteous spiritual and worldly <i>existence</i>, (<i>for</i> the benefit of the spiritual and worldly <i>existence</i>). 57. Owing to what desire (owing to what necessity) <i>was</i> the said announcement proclaimed <a name="fr_1773"></a><a href="#fn_1725"><font size="1">1</font></a> by him? (So that he shall become) the privileged developer, (he who is a resolute ruler). 58. For how many righteous (is it requisite to utter it)? (So that <i>one may</i> become) a developer, (even he who may be) an irresolute ruler <a name="fr_1774"></a><a href="#fn_1726"><font size="1">2</font></a>, (to whom they reveal these words. So that the glory of the Kayâns, such as <i>it is</i> with good rulers, should be even so with evil rulers; with good rulers for this purpose, that so they shall produce more benefit; and with evil rulers for this purpose, that so they shall produce less harm) <a name="fr_1775"></a><a href="#fn_1727"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  <h4 align="center">Pahl.

 <p>The beginning of the second subdivision <a name="fr_1776"></a><a href="#fn_1728"><font size="1">4</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>1. It was a proclamation of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, the Ashem vohû vahi<i>s</i>tem astî <a name="fr_1777"></a><a href="#fn_1729"><font size="1">5</font></a>; besides perfect excellence is taught by it to him, (that is, benefit is</p>

U<i>s</i>tâ astî, u<i>s</i>tâ ahmâi <a name="fr_1779"></a><a href="#fn_1731"><font size="1">2</font></a> has, besides, taught the righteous of every kind the happy progress which is necessary to arise for the righteous of every kind, (so that <a name="fr_1780"></a><a href="#fn_1732"><font size="1">3</font></a> happiness <i>may</i> be caused thereby); whatever endurance of man (<i>or</i> diligence) it is necessary for the righteous of every kind to occasion is, besides, taught to the righteous of <a name="fr_1781"></a><a href="#fn_1733"><font size="1">4</font></a> every kind, (so that one's happiness <i>may</i> be caused thereby). 3. Hya<i>d</i> ashâi vahi<i>s</i>tâi ashem <a name="fr_1782"></a><a href="#fn_1731"><font size="1">2</font></a> has, besides, taught <i>that</i> all (the duty and good works which are revealed in the text are the whole text (for him whose Avesta and Zand are easy, so that, through <i>its</i> Avesta and Zand, he can make manifest all the duty and good works of that whole text) (4) which teaches <a name="fr_1783"></a><a href="#fn_1734"><font size="1">5</font></a> <i>that</i> the dominion is for righteousness <a name="fr_1784"></a><a href="#fn_1735"><font size="1">6</font></a>, (so that, <i>one</i> may exercise authority through virtuousness, that is, it should be the opinion that it teaches a dominion through virtuousness, so that <i>one may</i> possess authority through virtuousness ) (5) which also teaches the truth to that righteous invoker, (so that he may make a true decision;) (6) <i>and</i> which also teaches the truth to you that are</p>

 <p>fraught with advantage, (so that it may produce true judgment). <i>These</i> were the three assertions, (that is, three decrees were in it,) (7) <i>and</i> the whole saying was a proclamation, the whole saying was that of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>.</p>  
 <p>8. Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> proclaimed; (<i>&amp;c., as in Pahl. Yas. XIX</i>, 56-58).</p>  <h4 align="center">Pahl. Yas. XXI = Bakŏ III.</h4>  <h4 align="center">The beginning of the third subdivision <a name="fr_1785"></a><a href="#fn_1736"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</h4>  
 <p>1. A saying of the righteous Zaratû<i>s</i>t, to be reverenced, was: 'Whoever of those existing is thus in worship as regards <i>the good</i> <a name="fr_1786"></a><a href="#fn_1737"><font size="1">2</font></a>': Here what is taught by it is the worship of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, (that <i>it is</i> that which <i>one</i> should provide for,) which is the law of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, (that is, his virtuous law,) whereby the reverence <i>of</i> existence is taught, (that is, that which he would most occasion, which is the ever-asking for progeny <i>by</i> mankind; and he mentions that thing to them,) <i>through</i> which <i>it</i> is possible for them to live well. 2. Here, besides, the reverence of those males <i>and</i> females of the righteous, through complete devotion <a name="fr_1787"></a><a href="#fn_1738"><font size="1">3</font></a> who <i>was</i> the first, is taught by it, (3) which is the obeisance <i>for</i> the archangels, (that is, it would occasion the propitiation of the archangels). <i>These</i> were the three assertions, (that is, three decrees were in it,) <i>and</i> it was <i>in</i> every way a saying to be reverenced. <i>Unto</i> whom was the reverence?

 <p>Dk. IX, Chap. XLVII, 11, refers to Pahl. Yas. XIX, 12-15, which is thus quoted in Sls. X, 26, in a shorter and altered form:'As it says in the Bak thus: "Whoever shall mutter, <i>O</i> Zaratû<i>s</i>t! my apportionment of the Ahunavair, (that is, shall softly take <i>it inwardly</i>) <i>and</i> shall let <i>it</i> escape <a name="fr_1791"></a><a href="#fn_1742"><font size="1">4</font></a> again, (that is, shall utter <i>it aloud</i>) so much as a half, or a third, or a fourth, or a fifth, his soul will I shield <a name="fr_1792"></a><a href="#fn_1743"><font size="1">5</font></a>, I who am Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, from the best existence, (that is, I <i>will</i> keep it away,) by such an extent as the width of this earth."'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1693"></a><a href="sbe37132.htm#fr_1734">453:1</a> As the detailed account of the first three fargar<i>d</i>s of this Nask, in Dk. IX, contains about 840 Pahlavi words, and represents about 730 words of the original Avesta text in Yas. XIXXXI, with 1630 in its Pahlavi version, it may be assumed that the detailed account of the whole Nask, extending to nearly 11,000 words, indicates about 9,500 words of Avesta text and 21,200 of Pahlavi version as the total extent of this Nask.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1694"></a><a href="sbe37132.htm#fr_1735">453:2</a> The heading of this first hâ is given in 32, Pt4, Mf4 which have been consulted by the translator in addition to Spiegel's text representing K5. The division into sections is that adopted by Spiegel, and the passages in parentheses have no equivalents in the Avesta text.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1695"></a><a href="sbe37132.htm#fr_1736">453:3</a> Sp., J2 insert 'good <i>and</i>.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1696"></a><a href="sbe37132.htm#fr_1737">453:4</a> J2 adds '(this is, Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> the creator is righteous; the rest is through the praise which says the creator is righteous);' compare Pahl. Vend. II, 1.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1697"></a><a href="sbe37132.htm#fr_1738">454:1</a> Assuming that the khr<i>a</i>fstar<i>d</i>ŏ, or khr<i>a</i>fôstar<i>d</i>ŏ, of Pt4, Mf4, stands for khrafstarânŏ, as required by the Avesta text. Sp., J2 have 'who were confounded by wisdom.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1698"></a><a href="sbe37132.htm#fr_1739">454:2</a> So in Pt4, Mf4; but Sp., J2 may mean 'he strictly does not speak out in the middle of its Avesta.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1699"></a><a href="sbe37132.htm#fr_1740">454:3</a> All the MSS. have 'while talking, <i>or</i> without anxiety,' as in § 8; but this does not correspond with the Avesta text. The repetition of the parenthetical clause, about the ceremonial, which also occurs in § 8, is likewise suspicious.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1718"></a><a href="sbe37132.htm#fr_1764">458:3</a> Only here, and in § 30, dâhm, 'a member of the community,' is substituted for the usual dâm, 'a creature.' Either meaning might suit the context, but the Avesta text clearly has 'creature,' and would require more alteration, to suit it to the Pahlavi version, than <i>vice versa</i>. Dk. IX, Chap. XLVII, affords no assistance, as it does not allude to this passage.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1720"></a><a href="sbe37132.htm#fr_1767">459:1</a> As the Pahlavi text of the foregoing interpretation is a commentary upon an Avesta commentary on an obscure Avesta text, it must be expected to be difficult to translate with certainty.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1731"></a><a href="sbe37132.htm#fr_1782">462:2</a> This phrase of the Ashem, which begins the Avesta of this section, must also be understood as beginning its Pahlavi version.</p>
