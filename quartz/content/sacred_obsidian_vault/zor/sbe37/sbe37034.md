 <p><a name="fn_265"></a><a href="sbe37034.htm#fr_266">101:1</a> Here, again, the repairer of the manuscript has forgotten to note the words in brackets which he had cut out of the folio before patching it.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_266"></a><a href="sbe37034.htm#fr_267">102:1</a> According to Bd. X, 1, XIV, 1, XXVII, 2, fifty-five species of <a name="page_103"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 103</font></a> grain sprang up originally where the primeval ox passed away; a statement which does not agree with that hinted at in this section.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_267"></a><a href="sbe37034.htm#fr_268">103:1</a> See Chap. XIII, 1.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_268"></a><a href="sbe37034.htm#fr_269">104:1</a> These six names are applied to the various grades of assault and wounding, for which a special scale of punishment is appointed (see Sls. I, 1, 2, XI, 1, 2, XVI, 1, 5). Here the list begins at the most heinous end of the scale, and the last three names, which refer to the lightest offences, have been already explained in Chaps. XIX, 1 n, XX, 64 n. The first three names are explained in Farh. Oîm, pp. 36, l. 7-37, l. 2, as follows:'For whatever reaches the source of life the name is Khôr; <i>one</i> explains B<i>â</i><i>z</i>âî <i>as</i> "smiting," <i>and</i> Yât <i>as</i> "going to," <i>though</i> it be possible <i>for</i> the soul of man to be withstanding; <i>and</i> a counterstroke is the penalty for a Yât when it <i>has</i> been so much <i>away</i> from the abode of life.' These six gradations of crime, therefore, range from the infliction of the nearest possible approximation to a fatal wound, down to the merely constructive assault of seizing a weapon. All authorities agree in estimating the relative heinousness of the first four crimes by the following numbers: 180, 90, 60, and 30; but regarding the amounts for the two lighter offences there is much difference of statement. In the old law of the Vendîdâ<i>d</i> there are seven gradations of such crime, the lowest four corresponding in name with the lowest four here, and all punishable by lashes, with a horse-whip, or scourge, varying from five to two hundred in number, according to the heinousness of the offence and the number of times it has been committed.</p>
