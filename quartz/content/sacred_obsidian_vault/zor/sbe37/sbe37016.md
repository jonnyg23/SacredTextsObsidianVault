The various races, which are specially enumerated, were ordered to disperse by the attracting or banishing command of the creator, to each separate race, as to the place where it went to; and whose life and soul (nisman) are appointed from yonder world. 4. Also the original description of their descent into the various regions, of those, too, who are on the frontiers of Khvanîras, and those who also made their habitation in the intermediate places; and the customs of each one of the species of mankind which was produced among the original races.</p>

The original establishment of law and custom; that of village superintendence (dihânkânîh) <a name="fr_94"></a><a href="#fn_93"><font size="1">5</font></a>, for the cultivation and nourishment of the world, based upon the traditional early law (vâsarî<i>d</i> pê<i>s</i>dâ<i>d</i>ŏ); and that of monarchy, for the protection and government</p>

 <p><a name="fn_94"></a><a href="sbe37016.htm#fr_95">27:1</a> This 'Hôshâng of the early law,' Av. Haoshyanghô paradhâtô, is considered to have been the great-grandson of Mashya and first monarch of the world, being the founder of the Pê<i>s</i>dâ<i>d</i>ian dynasty (see Bd. XV, 28, XXXI, I, XXXIV, 3, 4).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_95"></a><a href="sbe37016.htm#fr_96">27:2</a> Here written Tâkhmô-r<i>î</i>pô, Av. Takhmô-urupa; the great-grandson and successor of Hôshâng (see Bd. XXXI, 2, 3, XXXI V, 4).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_96"></a><a href="sbe37016.htm#fr_97">27:3</a> Av. Yimô khshaêtô, the <i>G</i>amshê<i>d</i> of the Shâhnâmah; the brother and successor of Tâkhmô-rupô (see Bd. XXXI, 3-5 XXXIV, 4).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_97"></a><a href="sbe37016.htm#fr_98">27:4</a> Also called <i>A</i><i>z</i>-î Dahâk, Av. a<i>z</i>i<i>s</i> dahâkô, 'destructive serpent,' a name applied to a foreign dynasty, considered as a single king who conquered Yim and succeeded him, being traditionally his third cousin once removed (see Bd. XXXI, 5, 6, XXXIV, 5). Further details are given in Bk. IX, Chap. XXI, 1-13. Dahâk was the last ruler of all the seven regions, excepting Kâî-Ûs.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_98"></a><a href="sbe37016.htm#fr_99">27:5</a> See Bd. XV, 26-28.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_99"></a><a href="sbe37016.htm#fr_100">27:6</a> Av. Thraêtaonô, son of Athwyô, and, traditionally, the ninth in descent from Yim (see Bd. XXXI, 7, 8); nine generations being assumed necessary to allow for the thousand years reign of the Dahâk dynasty which he put an end to. His rule was confined to the central region of Khvanîras.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_100"></a><a href="sbe37016.htm#fr_101">28:1</a> The land on the southern coast of the Caspian belonging to the Mâzainya daêva (demons, or idolators) of the Avesta.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_101"></a><a href="sbe37016.htm#fr_102">28:2</a> The last of whom was slain by his brothers, and was avenged by his descendant Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar (see Bd. XXXI, 9-I2).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_102"></a><a href="sbe37016.htm#fr_103">28:3</a> Possibly the celebrated individual of that name who is mentioned, in Pahl. Vend. XX, 4, as an instance of opulence. The Shâhnâmah speaks only of the three daughters of the king of Yaman.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_103"></a><a href="sbe37016.htm#fr_104">28:4</a> Or 'plundering;' but Tû<i>g</i>-hômônd here, and Tû<i>g</i>âvand in § 12, may perhaps mean 'descended from Tû<i>g</i>,' as Frâsîy<i>â</i><i>v</i> was the sixth in descent from Tû<i>g</i> (see Bd. XXXI, 14).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_104"></a><a href="sbe37016.htm#fr_105">28:5</a> Said to have been a great-grandson of Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar (see Bd. XXXI, 23).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_105"></a><a href="sbe37016.htm#fr_106">28:6</a> Probably the hero who was sixth in descent from Tû<i>g</i>, and third cousin of Frâsîy<i>â</i><i>v</i> (see Bk. IX, Chap. XV; Bd. 26, 27); though placed by Firdausî as a king Garshâsp preceding Kaî-Qubâd.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_106"></a><a href="sbe37016.htm#fr_107">28:7</a> As appears from Bd. XXXI, 25.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_107"></a><a href="sbe37016.htm#fr_108">28:8</a> The son of Kâî-Ûs, who did not become king.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_108"></a><a href="sbe37016.htm#fr_109">29:1</a> The people of the Airya, Tûirya, and Sairima provinces, mentioned in Yt. XIII, 143.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_109"></a><a href="sbe37016.htm#fr_110">29:2</a> Fifth in descent from Kavî-Kavâ<i>d</i>, and third cousin once removed of his predecessor Kaî-Khûsrôî (see Bd. XXXI, 25, 28).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_110"></a><a href="sbe37016.htm#fr_111">29:3</a> Son of Kaî-Lôharâsp (see Bd. XXXI, 29).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_111"></a><a href="sbe37016.htm#fr_112">29:4</a> The historical legends contained in the Avesta end with the sons of king Vi<i>s</i>tâsp, and other contemporaries of Zaratû<i>s</i>t; not a word being said of any succeeding monarch. Similarly, Bd. XXXI and this historical Nask fail to carry on the details of the royal line beyond Vi<i>s</i>tâsp; ignoring the Achæmenians, Alexander, and the A<i>s</i>kânians, they leap over an evident gap in history (very insufficiently bridged in the more modern chapter, Bd. XXXIV) to the Sasanians. This gap, between Avesta legends and the later undoubted Persian history, is a very weak point in the continuity of the two periods. And as the mode of bridging over this gap in Bd. XXXIV occurs in a chapter 'on the computation of years of the Arabs' (see S.B.E. vol. v, p. xxxvii) it must be considered as more of an Arab than a Persian contribution to history.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_112"></a><a href="sbe37016.htm#fr_113">29:5</a> Av. Naotara; a son of Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar (see Bd. XXXI, 13, 23, XXX III, 5).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_113"></a><a href="sbe37016.htm#fr_114">29:6</a> Doubtful; if the second name be a patronymic, the combination suggests the Yôi<i>s</i>tô yô Fryânanãm of Yt. V, 8,, XIII, 120, regarding whom the tale of Yô<i>s</i>t-î Fryânŏ is told. No son of <a name="page_30"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 30</font></a> Nô<i>d</i>ar with a corresponding name is known, so that we are not dealing with a complete pedigree.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_114"></a><a href="sbe37016.htm#fr_115">30:1</a> Probably intended for Spend-dad, and we should perhaps read 'Vohûmanô, son of Spend-dâ<i>d</i>,' whose reign is celebrated as the silver age in Byt. II, 17 (see also Bd. XXXI, 29, XXXIV, 8).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_115"></a><a href="sbe37016.htm#fr_116">30:2</a> This name, or surname, is given in Pâzand, and is also to be found in Yt. XIII, 106, as follows: 'we reverence the guardian spirit of the righteous Avarethrab<i>a</i>u, son of Râ<i>s</i>tare-vagha<i>n</i><i>t</i>.' If the latter epithet were a surname of Âtû<i>r</i>-pâ<i>d</i>, the famous prime minister of Shahpûhar II, as the text intimates, we must conclude that the former epithet was a surname of his only son, Zaratû<i>s</i>t, mentioned in his Pandnâmak. These surnames, and others of their time, might have been easily interpolated in the long list of uncouth names included in the Fravardîn Ya<i>s</i>t, when the Avesta books were revised during the reign of Shahpûhar II, and the Nasks were 'reckoned,' as stated in the fourth book of the Dinka<i>r</i><i>d</i> (see Haug's Essay on Pahlavi, pp. 146, 152).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_116"></a><a href="sbe37016.htm#fr_117">30:3</a> §§ 17-19 refer to text which must have been written either in the time of Shahpûhar II, or at some later period during Sasanian rule. Whereas §§ 1-16 are descriptive of an older record which, though consistent with the extant Avesta texts, could not have been compiled from them alone. And § 20 describes text that might have been written at any time.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_117"></a><a href="sbe37016.htm#fr_118">31:1</a> Reading vakhsh in the same Avesta sense as in vakhshvar, 'a prophet;' it may, however, mean 'gain, fortune, gifts.' A similarly-written word, vâyâ, 'air, breath,' is used in Sg. XIII, 7 to translate the 'Spirit' of God in Gen. i. 2.</p>
