 <p>1. I will praise the water Ardvi Sûra Anâhita, the wide-flowing (as it is) and healing in its influence,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_317"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 317</font></a></p>  
 <p>efficacious against the Daêvas, devoted to Ahura's lore, and to be worshipped with sacrifice within the corporeal world, furthering all living things <a name="fr_1336"></a><a href="#fn_1325"><font size="1">1</font></a> (?) and holy, helping on the increase and improvement of our herds and settlements, holy, and increasing our wealth, holy, and helping on the progress of the Province, holy (as she is)? 2. (Ardvi Sûra Anâhita) who purifies the seed of all male beings, who sanctifies the wombs of all women to the birth, who makes all women fortunate in labour, who brings all women a regular and timely flow of milk, (3) (Ardvi Sûra Anâhita) with a volume sounding from afar <a name="fr_1337"></a><a href="#fn_1326"><font size="1">2</font></a>, which is alone equal in its bulk to all the waters which flow forth upon earth, which flows down with mighty volume from high Hukairya to the sea Vouru-kasha. 4. And all the gulfs <a name="fr_1338"></a><a href="#fn_1327"><font size="1">3</font></a> in Vouru-kasha are stirred (when it falls down), all the middle doth well up when Ardvi Sûra Anâhita rushes in, when she plunges foaming into them, she, whose are a thousand tributaries, and a thousand outlets, and each as it flows in, or rushes out, is a forty days’ ride in length to a rider mounted well.</p>  
 <p>5. And the (chief) outlet to this one water (Ardvi Sûra Anâhita) goes apart, dividing to all the seven Karshvars. And this outlet to my river, Ardvi Sûra Anâhita, bears off its waters always in summer and in winter. This my river purifies the seed of men, and wombs of women, and women's milk <a name="fr_1339"></a><a href="#fn_1328"><font size="1">4</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>6. Let the saints’ Fravashis now draw near, those of the saints who live, or have lived, of those born, or yet to be born; yea, let them come near which</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_318"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 318</font></a></p>  
 <p>have borne these waters up stream from the nearest ones (that lie below as the outlet pours away <a name="fr_1340"></a><a href="#fn_1329"><font size="1">1</font></a>).</p>  
 <p>7. Let not our waters be for the man of ill intent, of evil speech, or deeds, or conscience; let them not be for the offender of a friend, not for an insulter of a Magian <a name="fr_1341"></a><a href="#fn_1330"><font size="1">2</font></a>, nor for one who harms the workmen, nor for one who hates his kindred. And let not our good waters (which are not only good, but) best, and Mazda-made, help on the man who strives to mar our settlements which are not to be corrupted, nor him who would mar our bodies, (our) uncorrupted (selves), (8) nor the thief, or bludgeon-bearing ruffian who would slaughter the disciples, nor a sorcerer, nor a burier of dead bodies, nor the jealous, nor the niggard, nor the godless heretic who slays disciples, nor the evil tyrant among men. Against these may our waters come as torments. As destructive may these come (?), may they come to him who has done those first (foul evils), as to him who does the last <a name="fr_1342"></a><a href="#fn_1331"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>9. O waters! rest <a name="fr_1343"></a><a href="#fn_1332"><font size="1">4</font></a> still within your places while the invoking priest shall offer.</p>  
 <p>Shall not the invoker make offering to these good waters, and with the inculcated words? (And how shall this be done?) Shall he not be tongue-fettered, if he offers else than with the ritual? Shall (not) the words be so delivered as the Aêthrapaiti teaches? Where shall the blessings be (inserted)? Where the supplications with confessions? Where the gifts of those that offer? 10 <a name="fr_1344"></a><a href="#fn_1333"><font size="1">5</font></a>. (It shall be only thus) as Ahura Mazda showed before to Zarathu<i>s</i>tra, and as Zarathu<i>s</i>tra</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_319"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 319</font></a></p>  
 <p>taught the corporeal worlds (the men on earth)! Thou shalt pray the first petition to the waters, O Zarathu<i>s</i>tra, and after that thou shalt offer the Zaothras to the waters, sanctified, and sought out with pious care; and thou shalt pronounce these words (as follows, thus): (11) O ye waters, I beseech of you this favour; and grant ye me this great one in whose bestowal ye flow down to me for the bettering (of my state), with a never-failing truth. O ye waters, I beseech of you for wealth of many kinds (which gives) power (to its holder <a name="fr_1345"></a><a href="#fn_1334"><font size="1">1</font></a>), and for an offspring self-dependent whom multitudes will bless, and for whose wasting, or defeat, or death, or vengeful punishment, or overtaking, no one prays. 12. And this do I beseech of you, O waters, this, O ye lands, and this, ye plants! This wealth and offspring I beseech of You, O Ye Bountiful Immortals, who rule aright, who dispose (of all) aright, O Ye good beings, male and female <a name="fr_1346"></a><a href="#fn_1335"><font size="1">2</font></a>, givers of good things; and this I beseech of you, O ye beneficent, mighty, and overwhelming Fravashis of the saints, and this (of thee), O Mithra of the wide pastures, and this of thee, O blest and stately Sraosha; and of thee, O Rashnu the most just, and of thee, O Fire, Ahura Mazda's son; and of thee, O lofty lord, the royal Apãm-napâ<i>t</i>, of the fleet horses; aye, of You all, ye Yazads, bestowers of the better gifts and holy. 13. And this do ye therefore grant me, O ye holy waters, and ye lands <a name="fr_1347"></a><a href="#fn_1336"><font size="1">3</font></a>!</p>  
 <p>14. And grant me likewise what is still greater than this all, and still better than this all, and more</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_320"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 320</font></a></p>  
 <p>beautiful, and more exceeding precious (and that is, Immortality and Welfare <a name="fr_1348"></a><a href="#fn_1337"><font size="1">1</font></a>), O Ye Yazads, holy and ruling mightily, and powerful at once, and grant it speedily according to this Gâthic (?) word: (Yea), by veritable grace let that be done <a name="fr_1349"></a><a href="#fn_1338"><font size="1">2</font></a> (?) for us which is most promotive of our weal. 15. And according to this further word again: Grant me, Thou who art maker of the Kine, the plants, and the waters, Immortality and likewise Weal, O Ahura Mazda, Thou most bounteous Spirit. And grant me these two eternal gifts through Thy Good Mind in the doctrine <a name="fr_1350"></a><a href="#fn_1339"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>
