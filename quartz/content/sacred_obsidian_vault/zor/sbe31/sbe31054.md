 <p>1. And now we sacrifice to the Kine's soul, and to her created body, and we sacrifice to the souls</p>  
 <p><a name="page_288"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 288</font></a></p>  
 <p>of cattle who are fit to live <a name="fr_1208"></a><a href="#fn_1198"><font size="1">1</font></a> (for us), and whose (we?) are, such as are the same to them.</p>  
 <p>2. And we worship the souls of those beasts which are tame and broken in, and of wild herds, and the souls of the saints wherever they were born, both of men and of women, whose good consciences are conquering in the strife against the Daêvas, or will conquer, or have conquered.</p>  
 <p>3. And now we worship the Bountiful Immortals (all) the good, and both those male <a name="fr_1209"></a><a href="#fn_1199"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and those female <a name="fr_1210"></a><a href="#fn_1200"><font size="1">3</font></a> (by their names). The males among them do we worship, ever living, and ever helpful, who dwell beside the pious, and the females thus the same. 4. As Thou, O Ahura Mazda! hast thought and spoken, as thou hast determined, and hast done these things (effecting) what is good, therefore do we offer to Thee, therefore do we ascribe to Thee our praises, and worship Thee, and bow ourselves before Thee; and therefore would we direct our prayers to Thee, Ahura! with confessions of our sin.</p>  
 <p>5. And we thus draw near to Thee together with the good kinship of our kindred, with that of Righteousness the blessed, and the good law of thrift and energy and the good Piety, the ready mind (within Thy folk)!</p>
