 <p>1. Propitiation be to Ahura Mazda. A blessing is Asha Vahi<i>s</i>ta—. I confess myself a Mazdayasnian, and of Zarathu<i>s</i>tra's order, a foe to the Daêvas, devoted to the lore of the Lord, for Aiwisrûthrima, and Aibigaya <a name="fr_1576"></a><a href="#fn_1548"><font size="1">6</font></a>, the holy lord(s) of the ritual order, for their sacrifice, homage, propitiation, and praise, and for Frâda<i>t</i>-vîspãm-hu<i>g</i>yâiti <a name="fr_1577"></a><a href="#fn_1549"><font size="1">7</font></a> and Zarathu<i>s</i>trôtema <a name="fr_1578"></a><a href="#fn_1550"><font size="1">8</font></a>, the holy lord(s) of the ritual order, for their sacrifice, homage, propitiation, and praise. 2.

(See Gâh I, 3, 4.) 5. And we sacrifice to Aiwisrûthrima (and) Aibigaya, the holy lord(s) of the ritual order, and to thee, O Ahura Mazda's Fire! And we sacrifice to the stone-mortar, and to the iron-mortar, and to this Baresman spread with sanctity, with the Zaothra, and with its girdle, holy lords of the ritual order. Also we sacrifice to the sacred two, to the waters and the plants, and to the sacred vows for the soul, (as) holy lord(s) of the ritual order. 6. Also we sacrifice to Frâda<i>t</i>-vîspãm-hu<i>g</i>yâiti (as) ruling in the ritual order; and we sacrifice to Zarathu<i>s</i>tra, the holy lord of the ritual; also we sacrifice to the Mãthra Spe<i>n</i>ta, (the bounteous word of reason <a name="fr_1579"></a><a href="#fn_1551"><font size="1">1</font></a>), and to the soul of the Kine, and to the Zarathu<i>s</i>trôtema <a name="fr_1580"></a><a href="#fn_1552"><font size="1">2</font></a>.

 <p>sacrifice to the youth of the spoken word (who spoke the words which we hold so dear <a name="fr_1581"></a><a href="#fn_1553"><font size="1">1</font></a>), the holy lord of the ritual order. Yea, we sacrifice to the youth who is given to his kin (and married to his blood), the holy lord of the ritual order. And we sacrifice to him who ranges through the province <a name="fr_1582"></a><a href="#fn_1554"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and to the itinerant with his many arts <a name="fr_1583"></a><a href="#fn_1555"><font size="1">3</font></a>, the holy ritual lords. And we sacrifice to the house-mistress, holy, and ruling in the ritual order. 9. And we sacrifice to the holy woman forward <a name="fr_1584"></a><a href="#fn_1556"><font size="1">4</font></a> in good thoughts, and words, and deeds, receiving her instructions well, having her husband as her lord, the holy, and such as Âramaiti, the bounteous, is, and such as are thy wives, O Mazda, Lord!</p>  
 <p>And we sacrifice to the holy man most forward in good thoughts, and words, and works, wise as to piety, simple as to sin, by whose deeds the settlements advance in the holy order, for the worship and homage of the Zarathu<i>s</i>trôtema, the lord. And we sacrifice to the Zarathu<i>s</i>trôtema, the holy lord of the ritual order. 10. And we sacrifice to the good, heroic, bountiful Fravashis of the saints, and to the women who have many sons, and to that Prosperity which endures throughout the year, and to the well-shaped and stately Strength. And we sacrifice to the Blow of Victory, Ahura-given, and to the crushing Ascendency which it secures. 11, 12. (See Gâh I, 9, 10.) 13. (The Ahuna-vairya, &amp;c.)</p>
