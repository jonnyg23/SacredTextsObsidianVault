 <p><a name="page_195"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 195</font></a></p>  <h1 align="center">THE YASNA.</h1>  
 <p><font size="-1">IT is now hardly necessary to say that the Yasna is the chief liturgy of the Zarathu<i>s</i>trians, in which confession, invocation, prayer, exhortation, and praise are all combined as in other liturgies. Like other compositions of the kind, it is made up of more or less mutually adapted fragments of different ages, and modes of composition. The Gâthas are sung in the middle of it, and in the Vendîdâd Sâdah, the Visparad is interpolated within it for the most part at the ends of chapters.</font></p>  
 <p>We have no reason to suppose that the Yasna existed in its present form in the earlier periods of Zarathu<i>s</i>trianism, but we have also no reason to doubt that its present arrangement is, as regards us, very ancient. The word Yasna means worship including sacrifice. Introductory excerpts occur in several MSS., and are now printed by Geldner. They are to be found in Y. I, 23; Y. III, 25; Y. XI, 17, 18; Y. XXII, 23-27; Y. XXVII, 13, 14; Ny. I, 2.</p>  <h3 align="center">YASNA I.</h3>  <h4 align="center">THE SACRIFICE COMMENCES.</h4>
