 <h3 align="CENTER">Footnotes</h3>
 <p><a name="fn_1408"></a><a href="sbe31080.htm#fr_1420">341:2</a> This chapter 1-5 follows Y. XI, 1-8 in the Vendîdâd Sâdah; so, appropriately.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1409"></a><a href="sbe31080.htm#fr_1421">341:3</a> The Ratu answers for all according to the rubric printed by Westergaard, but of later origin than the text. It arose from the fact that the several offices were later united in that of the Ratu. Originally the corresponding official answered to his title. The Hâvanan was the Mobad who pounded the Haoma in the mortar.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1410"></a><a href="sbe31080.htm#fr_1422">341:4</a> The Mobad who fed the Fire.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1411"></a><a href="sbe31080.htm#fr_1423">341:5</a> The Mobad who aided the presentations.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1412"></a><a href="sbe31080.htm#fr_1424">341:6</a> The water carrier.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1413"></a><a href="sbe31080.htm#fr_1425">342:1</a> The washer.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1414"></a><a href="sbe31080.htm#fr_1426">342:2</a> The mixer (?), or the Mobad who attended to disinfections.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1415"></a><a href="sbe31080.htm#fr_1427">342:3</a> The Mobad who attended to penance.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1416"></a><a href="sbe31080.htm#fr_1428">342:4</a> The typical layman.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1417"></a><a href="sbe31080.htm#fr_1429">342:5</a> This important custom was fully treated in the lost Nask, No. 16 (or No. 18, by another reckoning).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1418"></a><a href="sbe31080.htm#fr_1430">342:6</a> So the most, but ratukhshathra means elsewhere 'ruling in the ritual as supreme.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1419"></a><a href="sbe31080.htm#fr_1431">343:1</a> This section follows Y. XI, 9-15 in the V.S., preceding a section described as Y. XI, 59, 60, in the B.V.S.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1420"></a><a href="sbe31080.htm#fr_1433">343:2</a> Probably in an imperative sense, or, with some, an infinitive.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1421"></a><a href="sbe31080.htm#fr_1434">343:3</a> Read Zaotasti which contains sandhi. It seems a gloss to explain the Âthraom (sic). It is zaotâ asti.</p>
