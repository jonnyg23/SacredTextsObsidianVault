 <p>1. All good thoughts, and all good words, and all good deeds are thought, and spoken, and done with intelligence and all evil thoughts, and words, and deeds are thought, and spoken, and done with folly. 2. And let (the men who think, and speak, and do) all good thoughts, and words, and deeds inhabit <a name="fr_1594"></a><a href="#fn_1565"><font size="1">1</font></a> Heaven (as their home). And let those who think, and speak, and do evil thoughts, and words, and deeds abide in Hell. For to all who think good thoughts, speak good words, and do good deeds, Heaven, the best world, belongs. And this is evident, and as of course (?) (or, 'and therewith their seed').</p>
