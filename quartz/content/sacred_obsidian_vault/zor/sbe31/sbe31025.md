 <p><a name="fn_925"></a><a href="sbe31024.htm#fr_929">207:1</a> See note on Y. I, 16.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_926"></a><a href="sbe31025.htm#fr_930">207:2</a> Spiegel has observed with truth that Ameretatâ<i>t</i> and Haurvatâ<i>t</i> may represent severally all the fruits and the liquids offered.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_927"></a><a href="sbe31025.htm#fr_931">207:3</a> The modern Parsis, Haug following, render 'butter'; but Spiegel is inclined to discredit this later tradition, holding that 'flesh' was originally intended; but on its becoming disused in India, milk was substituted, hence the error.</p>  
 <p>Gau<i>s</i> hudh<i>a</i>u, in its primary sense, meant of course 'the Kine of blessed endowment.' (Repetitions are again curtailed.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_928"></a><a href="sbe31025.htm#fr_932">208:1</a> The Haoma-juice.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_929"></a><a href="sbe31025.htm#fr_933">208:2</a> So better than 'fresh meat.' Fluids are the chief objects of attention here.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_930"></a><a href="sbe31025.htm#fr_934">208:3</a> With its girdle.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_931"></a><a href="sbe31025.htm#fr_935">208:4</a> Anghuyãm—rathwãm stand related as ahû and ratu; so also the Pahlavi ahûŏîh and ra<i>d</i>îh, and Ner. svâmitâ<i>m</i><i>k</i>a gurutâ<i>m</i><i>k</i>a.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_932"></a><a href="sbe31025.htm#fr_936">209:1</a> Ye<i>s</i>tî seems used of an especial Ya<i>s</i>t here, and subsequently, as genitives intrude among datives, the form possibly taking the place of the words 'for the propitiation of'; here Ya<i>s</i>t X may be referred to.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_934"></a><a href="sbe31025.htm#fr_938">212:1</a> So at least the rubric. One would think that the sentence was intended to be dictated to the Ratu to be repeated; that is, if the <a name="page_213"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 213</font></a> rubric is correct. The sentence as uttered by the priest seems difficult.</p>
