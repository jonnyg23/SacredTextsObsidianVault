 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>The Zend Avesta, Part II (SBE23)</i>, James Darmesteter, tr. [1882], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">V. ÂBÂN YA<i>S</i>T.</h3>  
 <p><font size="-1">The Âbân Ya<i>s</i>t (or Ya<i>s</i>t of the Waters) is devoted to the great goddess of the waters, the celebrated Ardvi Sûra Anâhita, the Ἀναῖτις of the Greeks. Ardvi Sûra Anâhita ('the high, powerful, undefiled') is the heavenly spring from which all waters on the earth flow down; her fountains are on the top of the mythical mountain, the Hukairya, in the star region. Her descent from the heavens is described in §§ 85 seq.; it reminds one of the Indian legend of the celestial Gaṅgâ.</font></p>  
 <p>This Ya<i>s</i>t contains much valuable information about the historical legends of Iran, as it enumerates the several heroes who worshipped Ardvi Sûra and asked for her help. First of all is Ahura himself (§ 16); then came Haoshyangha (§21), Yima (§ 25), A<i>z</i>i Dahâka (§ 29), Thraêtaona (§ 33), Keresâspa (§ 37), Franghrasyan (§ 41), Kava Usa (§ 45), Husravah (§ 49), Tusa (§ 53). Vaêsaka's sons (§ 57), Vafra Navâza (§ 61), <i>G</i>âmâspa (§ 68), Ashavazdah, the son of Pourudhâkh<i>s</i>ti, and Ashavazdah and Thrita, the sons of Sâyu<i>z</i>dri (§ 72), Vistauru (§ 76), Yôi<i>s</i>ta (§ 81); the Hvôvas and the Naotaras (§ 98), Zarathu<i>s</i>tra (§ 103), Kava Vî<i>s</i>tâspa (§ 107), Zairivairi (§ 112), Are<i>g</i>a<i>t</i>-aspa and Vandaremaini (§ 116).</p>  
 <p>This enumeration is interrupted by a description of the descent of Ardvi Sûra from the heavens (§§ 85-89), and of certain rules for her sacrifice given by herself to Zarathu<i>s</i>tra (§§ 90-97). This interruption may have been intentional, as it takes place just when</p>  
 <p><a name="page_53"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 53</font></a></p>  
 <p><font size="-1">the course of the enumeration brings us to the times of Zarathu<i>s</i>tra and of the institution of the new religion.</font></p>  
 <p>The Ya<i>s</i>t is opened with a laudation of the benefits bestowed by Ardvi Sûra (§§ 1-16), and it closes with a description of her garments and apparel.</p>  
 <p>The first record of the worship of Ardvi Sûra is in a cuneiform inscription by Artaxerxes Mnemon (404-361), in which her name is corrupted into Anahata. Artaxerxes Mnemon appears to have been an eager promoter of her worship, as he is said 'to have first erected the statues of Venus-Anâhita (Ἀφροδίτης, Ἀναΐτιδος) in Babylon, Suza, and Ecbatana, and to have taught her worship to the Persians, the Bactrians, and the people of Damas and Sardes' (Clemens Alexandrinus, Protrept. 5, on the authority of Berosus; about 260 B.C.). My friend M. Halévy suggests to me that the detailed and circumstantial description of Anâhita's appearance and costume (in §§ 126-131) shows that the writer must have described her from a consecrated type of statuary.</p>  
 <p>The principal data of the Greek writers on Anâhita will be found in Windischmann's Essay (Die persische Anahita oder Anaïtis, 1856). One must be cautious in the use of the Greek sources, as the Greeks, with the eclectic turn of their mind, were inclined to confound under the name of Anâhita all the great female deities of Asia Minor, and her name became a common appellation for the Aphrodites as well as for the Artemides of the East.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_303"></a><a href="sbe2310.htm#fr_321">60:2</a> When Yima began to sin and lost the <i>H</i><i>v</i>arenô (Glory), he was overthrown by A<i>z</i>i Dahâka (Zohâk), who seized the power and reigned in his place for a thousand years (cf. Yt. XIX, 33 seq.).</p>  
 <p>A<i>z</i>i Dahâka, literally 'the fiendish snake,' was first a mythical personage; he was the 'snake' of the storm-cloud, and a counterpart of the Vedic Ahi or V<i>ri</i>tra. He appears still in that character in Ya<i>s</i>t XIX seq., where he is described struggling for the <i>H</i><i>v</i>arenô against Âtar (Fire), in the sea Vourukasha (Vendîdâd, Introd. IV, 38; cf. this Ya<i>s</i>t, § 90). His struggle with Yima Khshaêta bore at first the same mythological character, 'the shining Yima' being originally, like the Vedic Yama, a solar hero: when Yima was turned into an earthly king, A<i>z</i>i underwent the same fate. In the Shâh Nâmah he is described as a man with two snakes springing from his shoulders: they grew there through a kiss of Ahriman's. For the myths referring to A<i>z</i>i, see Ormazd et Ahriman, §§ 91-95.</p>

The usurper A<i>z</i>i, being a non-Aryan, was identified with the hereditary foe, the Chaldæans: the name of Babylon united in it, at the same time, a dim historical record of the old Assyrian oppression, then shaken off and forgotten, and an actual expression of the national antipathy of the Iranians for their Semitic neighbours in Chaldæa. After the conquest of Persia by the Musulmans, A<i>z</i>i was turned at last into an Arab. The original seat of the A<i>z</i>i myths was on the southern coast of the Caspian Sea (Études Iraniennes, II, 210).</p>

Thraêtaona delivered them, and then married them; he had a son, Airyu, from Arnavâz, and two sons from Shahrinâz, Tura and Sairima; Airyu, Tura, and Sairima became the kings of Irân, Tûrân, and Rûm.</p>

It was a monster who lived 'in the sea, on the mountain, and in the valley;' he was called Pâshnah zarah, because the sea did not go above his heel (a misinterpretation of his Avestean epithet zairi pâshna, golden-heeled, the Zend zairi being mistaken for the Persian zarah <a name="img_06300"></a>

Keresâspa fought him for nine days and nine nights together; he drew him at last from the bottom of the sea and smashed his head with his club: when he fell on the ground, many countries were spoiled by his fall (Spiegel, Die traditionnelle Literatur der Parsen, P. 339, and West, Pahlavi Texts, II, pp. 369 seq.).</p>  
 <p>In the Vedic mythology the Gandharva is the keeper of Soma, and is described now as a god, now as a fiend, according as he is a heavenly Soma-priest or a jealous possessor who grudges it to man. What was the original form of the myth in Mazdeism is not clear. In the Shâh Nâmah he appears as the minister of A<i>z</i>i Dahâka. Cf. Yt.

 <p><a name="fn_315"></a><a href="sbe2310.htm#fr_333">64:1</a> Frangrasyan (Afrâsyâb) was king of Tûrân for two hundred years. The perpetual struggle between Irân and Tûrân, which lasts to this day, was represented in the legend by the deadly and endless wars between Afrâsyâb and the Iranian kings from Mino<i>k</i>ihr down to Kai Khosrav (Kavi Husravah). The chief cause of the feud was the murder of Syâvakhsh (Syâvarshâna) by Afrâsyâb; Syâvakhsh, son of Kai Kaus (Kava Usa), having been exiled by his father, at the instigation of his mother-in-law, took refuge with Afrâsyâb, who received him with honour, and gave him his daughter in marriage: but the fortune of Syâvakhsh raised the jealousy of Afrâsyâb's brother, Karsîvaz (Keresavazda), who by means of calumnious accusations extorted from Afrâsyâb an order for putting him to death (see Yt. XIX, 77). Syâvakhsh was revenged by his son, Kai Khosrav, the grandson of Afrâsyâb (Yt. IX, 22).</p>

In an older form of the legend, that cave was a palace built under-ground, with walls of iron and a hundred columns: its height was a thousand times a man's size (Aogemaidê, § 61; cf. Bund.
