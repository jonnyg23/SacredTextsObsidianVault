 <p><font size="-1">Ti<i>s</i>trya is the leader of the stars against the planets, as stars and planets belong, respectively, to the worlds of Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu (Vend. Introd. IV, 36; Bund. II, 5 seq.).</font></p>  
 <p>This Ya<i>s</i>t is a description of the production of the rain through the agency of the star Ti<i>s</i>trya. It has to struggle against the Daêva of Drought, Apaosha, is first overcome and conquers at last. This seems to be a refacimento of the old storm myths, which have been in so far renewed as the role of the hero in the original myth has been transferred to a star. It is to be noticed, however, that Apaosha is not described as a planet.</p>  
 <p>Ti<i>s</i>trya is Sirius <a name="fr_476"></a><a href="#fn_455"><font size="1">1</font></a>. It presides over the first month of summer (21 June-21 July). This Ya<i>s</i>t appears thus to have been written in a part of Iran where the dog-days must have fallen in July, and the rainy season began in the last days of July, unless the place of Ti<i>s</i>trya in the calendar has been changed at some later period.</p>  
 <p>This Ya<i>s</i>t is recited on the days of Ti<i>s</i>trya, Haurvatâ<i>t</i> (as the Genius of Waters), Farvardîn (as the Fravashis are his allies in the struggle; § 34), and Bâd (the wind; § 32).</p>  
 <p>The struggle between Ti<i>s</i>trya and Apaosha is described in the Bundahi<i>s</i> (VII), but it has there a cosmological character: it has not for its object the annual and regular return of the rains after the dog-days, but the production of the seas and lakes in the first ages of the world.</p>
