 <p><font size="-1">Regarding Bahrâm (Verethraghna), the Genius of Victory, see Vend. Introd. V, 8.</font></p>  
 <p>This Ya<i>s</i>t can be divided into four parts:—</p>  
 <p>I (§§ 1-28). An enumeration of the ten incarnations in which Verethraghna appeared to Zarathu<i>s</i>tra (as a wind, § 2; as a bull, § 7; as a horse, § 9; as a camel, § 11; as a boar, § 15; as a youth, § 17; as a raven, § 19; as a ram, § 23; as a buck, § 25; and as a man, § 27).</p>  
 <p>II (§§ 30-33). The powers given by Verethraghna to his worshipper, Zarathu<i>s</i>tra.</p>  
 <p>III (§§ 34-46). The magical powers, ascribed to the raven's feather, of striking terror into an army and dispersing it (the raven being the seventh incarnation of Verethraghna).</p>  
 <p>IV (§§ 47-64). The glorification of Verethraghna.</p>

 <p>Ahura Mazda answered: 'It is Verethraghna, made by Ahura, O Spitama Zarathu<i>s</i>tra!'</p>  
 <p>2. Verethraghna, made by Ahura, came to him first, running in the shape of a strong, beautiful wind, made by Mazda; he bore the good Glory, made by Mazda, the Glory made by Mazda, that is both health and strength.</p>  
 <p>3. Then he, who is the strongest <a name="fr_1094"></a><a href="#fn_1036"><font size="1">1</font></a>, said unto him <a name="fr_1095"></a><a href="#fn_1037"><font size="1">2</font></a>: 'I am the strongest in strength; I am the most victorious in victory; I am the most glorious in Glory; I am the most favouring in favour; I am the best giver of welfare; I am the best-healing in health-giving.</p>  
 <p>4. 'And I shall destroy the malice of all the malicious, the malice of Daêvas and men, of the Yâtus and Pairikas, of the oppressors, the blind, and the deaf.</p>  
 <p>5. 'For his brightness and glory, I will offer unto him a sacrifice worth being heard; namely, unto Verethraghna, made by Ahura. We worship Verethraghna, made by Ahura, with an offering of libations, according to the primitive ordinances of Ahura; with the Haoma and meat, the baresma, the wisdom of the tongue, the holy spells, the speech, the deeds, the libations, and the rightly-spoken words.</p>

 <p>7. Verethraghna, made by Ahura, came to him the second time, running in the shape of a beautiful bull, with yellow ears and golden horns; upon whose horns floated the well-shapen Strength, and Victory, beautiful of form, made by Ahura: thus did he come, bearing the good Glory, made by Mazda, the Glory made by Mazda, that is both health and strength.</p>
