 <p><font size="-1">Dîn (Daêna) presides over the 24th day of the month (Sîrôzah 24) and gives it her name; she is invoked in company with <i>K</i>ista, and in fact this Ya<i>s</i>t, though it bears the name of Daêna, is consecrated to Kista (§§ 2, 7). These two Genii are, however, very closely connected in their nature, as Daêna is the impersonation of the Zoroastrian Law or Religion, and Kista is religious knowledge, the knowledge of what leads to bliss (far<i>g</i>ânak, nirvâ<i>n</i>a<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>âna; the same as <i>K</i>isti).</font></p>  
 <p>The description of <i>K</i>ista is rather pallid, and does not rise above abstractions (see, however, Mihir Ya<i>s</i>t, § 126). She was not worshipped by the old epic heroes as Anâhita was, but by Zarathu<i>s</i>tra and his wife, because she must have been, from her very name and nature, a goddess of Zoroastrian origin and growth.</p>
