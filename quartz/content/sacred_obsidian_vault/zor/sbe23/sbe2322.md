 <p><font size="-1">Ashi Vanguhi or 'the good Ashi <a name="fr_1212"></a><a href="#fn_1150"><font size="1">1</font></a>' is a feminine impersonation of piety <a name="fr_1213"></a><a href="#fn_1151"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and she is, at the same time, the source of all the good and riches that are connected with piety <a name="fr_1214"></a><a href="#fn_1152"><font size="1">3</font></a>. She is described, therefore, as a goddess of Fortune and Wealth, and is invoked in company with Pâre<i>n</i>di, the goddess of Treasures (Sîrôzah 25).</font></p>  
 <p>She appears in the latter character in the first part of the Ya<i>s</i>t (§§ 1-14); she praises and loves Zarathu<i>s</i>tra (§§ 15-21). She is worshipped by Hao<i>s</i>yangha (§ 26), Yima (§ 28), Thraêtaona (§33), Haoma (§ 37), Husravah (§ 41), Zarathu<i>s</i>tra (§ 45), and Vî<i>s</i>tâspa (§ 49) <a name="fr_1215"></a><a href="#fn_1153"><font size="1">4</font></a>. She rejects the offerings of all sterile people (old men, courtezans, and children, §§ 53-61).</p>  <h4 align="center">I.</h4>

For her brightness and glory, I will offer her a sacrifice worth being heard; I will offer up unto Ashi Vanguhi a good sacrifice with an offering of libations. We sacrifice unto Ashi Vanguhi with the libations; with the Haoma and meat, with the baresma, with the wisdom of the tongue, with the holy spells, with the words, with the deeds, with the libations, and with the rightly-spoken words.</p>

 <p>Spitama Zarathu<i>s</i>tra came nearer unto her, he leant against her chariot.</p>

 <p>57. The first wailing of the great Ashi Vanguhi is her wailing about the courtezan who destroys her fruit: 'Stand thou not near her, sit thou not on her bed!'—'What shall I do? Shall I go back to the heavens? Shall I sink into the earth?'</p>  
 <p>58. The second wailing of the great Ashi Vanguhi is her wailing about the courtezan who brings forth a child conceived of a stranger and presents it to her husband: 'What shall I do? Shall I go back to the heavens? Shall I sink into the earth?'</p>  
 <p>59. This is the third wailing of the great Ashi Vanguhi: 'This is the worst deed that men and tyrants do, namely, when they deprive maids, that have been barren for a long time, of marrying and bringing forth children. What shall I do? Shall I go back to the heavens? Shall I sink into the earth?'</p>  
 <p>60. Ahura Mazda answered: 'O fair and wise Ashi, go not back to the heavens, sink not into the</p>
