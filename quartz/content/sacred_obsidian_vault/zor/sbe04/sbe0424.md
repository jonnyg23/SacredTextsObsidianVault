 <p>1. 'There is many a one, O holy Zarathu<i>s</i>tra!' said Ahura Mazda, 'who wears a Paitidâna <a name="fr_984"></a><a href="#fn_972"><font size="1">2</font></a> but who has not girded his loins with the law <a name="fr_985"></a><a href="#fn_973"><font size="1">3</font></a>; when such a man says, "I am an Âthravan," he lies; do not call him an Âthravan, O holy Zarathu<i>s</i>tra!' thus said Ahura Mazda.</p>  
 <p>2 (5). 'He holds a Khrafstraghna <a name="fr_986"></a><a href="#fn_974"><font size="1">4</font></a> in his hand, but he has not girded his loins with the law; when he says, "I am an Âthravan," he lies; do not call him an Âthravan, O holy Zarathu<i>s</i>tra!' thus said Ahura Mazda.</p>

 <p>3 (7). 'He holds a twig <a name="fr_987"></a><a href="#fn_975"><font size="1">1</font></a> in his hand, but he has not girded his loins with the law; when he says, "I am an Âthravan," he lies; do not call him an Âthravan, O holy Zarathu<i>s</i>tra!' thus said Ahura Mazda.</p>  
 <p>4 (9). 'He wields the A<i>s</i>tra mairya <a name="fr_988"></a><a href="#fn_976"><font size="1">2</font></a>, but he has not girded his loins with the law; when he says, "I am an Âthravan," he lies; do not call him an Âthravan, O holy Zarathu<i>s</i>tra!' thus said Ahura Mazda.</p>  
 <p>5 (11). 'He who sleeps on throughout the night, who does not perform the Yasna nor chant the hymns, who does not worship by word or by deed, who does neither learn nor teach, with a longing for (everlasting) life, he lies when he says, "I am an Âthravan," do not call him an Âthravan, O holy Zarathu<i>s</i>tra!' thus said Ahura Mazda.</p>  
 <p>6 (14). ‘Him thou shalt call an Âthravan, O holy Zarathu<i>s</i>tra! who throughout the night sits up and demands of the holy Wisdom <a name="fr_989"></a><a href="#fn_977"><font size="1">3</font></a>, which makes man free from anxiety, with dilated heart, and cheerful at the head of the <i>K</i>inva<i>t</i> bridge <a name="fr_990"></a><a href="#fn_978"><font size="1">4</font></a>, and which makes him reach that world, that holy world, that excellent world, the world of paradise.</p>

 <p>8 (21). Zarathu<i>s</i>tra asked Ahura Mazda: 'O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! What is it that makes the unseen power of Death increase?'</p>  
 <p>9 (22). Ahura Mazda answered: ‘It is the man that teaches a wrong law <a name="fr_992"></a><a href="#fn_980"><font size="1">2</font></a>; it is the man who continues for three years <a name="fr_993"></a><a href="#fn_981"><font size="1">3</font></a> without wearing the sacred girdle <a name="fr_994"></a><a href="#fn_982"><font size="1">4</font></a>, without chanting the Gâthas, without worshipping the good waters.</p>

 <p>liberty, when bound in prison <a name="fr_995"></a><a href="#fn_983"><font size="1">1</font></a>, does no better deed than if he should flay a man alive and cut off his head <a name="fr_996"></a><a href="#fn_984"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>11 (27). ‘The blessing uttered on a wicked, ungodly Ashemaogha does not go past the mouth (of the blesser); the blessing for two Ashemaoghas does not go past his tongue; the blessing for three is no word at all; the blessing for four is a curse against himself.</p>  
 <p>12 (29). ‘Whosoever should give some Haoma juice to a wicked, ungodly Ashemaogha, or some Myazda consecrated with blessings, does no better deed than if he should lead a thousand horse against the cities of the worshippers of Mazda, and should slaughter the men thereof, and drive off the cattle as plunder.</p>  <h3 align="center">II.</h3>  
 <p>13 (32). 'Demand of me, thou upright one! of me, who am the Maker, the best of all beings, the most knowing, the most pleased in answering what is asked of me; demand of me, that thou mayst be the better, that thou mayst be the happier.'</p>  
 <p>14 (33). Zarathu<i>s</i>tra asked Ahura Mazda: 'Who is the Sraosha-varez <a name="fr_997"></a><a href="#fn_985"><font size="1">3</font></a> of Sraosha <a name="fr_998"></a><a href="#fn_986"><font size="1">4</font></a>? the holy, strong Sraosha, who is the incarnate Word, a mighty-speared and lordly god.'</p>

 <p>15 (34). Ahura Mazda answered: ‘It is the bird named Parôdar<i>s</i> <a name="fr_999"></a><a href="#fn_987"><font size="1">1</font></a>, which ill-speaking people call Kahrkatâs <a name="fr_1000"></a><a href="#fn_988"><font size="1">2</font></a>, O holy Zarathu<i>s</i>tra! the bird that lifts up his voice against the mighty dawn:</p>  
 <p>16 (37). ‘“Arise, O men! recite the Ashem ya<i>d</i> vahi<i>s</i>tem that smites down the Daêvas <a name="fr_1001"></a><a href="#fn_989"><font size="1">3</font></a>. Lo! here is Bûshyãsta, the long-handed <a name="fr_1002"></a><a href="#fn_990"><font size="1">4</font></a>, coming upon you, who lulls to sleep again the whole living world, as soon as it has awoke: ‘Sleep!’ she says, ‘sleep on, O man! the time <a name="fr_1003"></a><a href="#fn_991"><font size="1">5</font></a> is not yet come.’”</p>  
 <p>17 (41). ‘For the three excellent things be never slack, namely, good thoughts, good words, and good deeds; for the three abominable things be ever slack, namely, bad thoughts, bad words, and bad deeds.”</p>  
 <p>18 (43). ‘In the first part of the night, Fire, the son of Ahura Mazda, calls the master of the house for help, saying:</p>  
 <p>19 (43). ‘"Up! arise, thou master of the house! put on thy girdle on thy clothes, wash thy hands, take wood, bring it unto me, and let me burn bright</p>

 <p>with the clean wood, carried by thy well-washed hands <a name="fr_1004"></a><a href="#fn_992"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Here comes Âzi <a name="fr_1005"></a><a href="#fn_993"><font size="1">2</font></a>, made by the Daêvas, who is about to strive against me, and wants to put out my life."</p>  
 <p>20 (46). ‘In the second part of the night, Fire, the son of Ahura Mazda, calls the husbandman for help, saying:</p>  
 <p>21 (46). ‘"Up! arise, thou husbandman! Put on thy girdle on thy clothes, wash thy hands, take wood, bring it unto me, and let me burn bright with the clean wood, carried by thy well-washed hands. Here comes Âzi, made by the Daêvas, who is about to strive against me, and wants to put out my life."</p>  
 <p>22 (48). ‘In the third part of the night, Fire, the son of Ahura Mazda, calls the holy Sraosha for help, saying: "Come thou, holy, tall-formed Sraosha, then he brings unto me some clean wood with his well-washed hands <a name="fr_1006"></a><a href="#fn_994"><font size="1">3</font></a>: here comes Âzi, made by the Daêvas, who is about to strive against me, and wants to put out my life."</p>  
 <p>23 (50). ‘And then the holy Sraosha wakes up the bird named Parôdar<i>s</i>, which ill-speaking people call Kahrkatâs, and the bird lifts up his voice against the mighty dawn:</p>  
 <p>24 (52). ‘“Arise, O men! recite the Ashem ya<i>d</i> vahi<i>s</i>tem that smites down the Daêvas. Lo! here is Bûshyãsta, the long-handed, coming upon you, who lulls to sleep again the whole living world as</p>

 <p>soon as it has awoke: ‘Sleep!’ she says, ‘sleep on, O man! the time is not yet come.’”</p>  
 <p>25 (52). ‘"For the three excellent things be never slack, namely, good thoughts, good words, and good deeds; for the three abominable things be ever slack, namely, bad thoughts, bad words, and bad deeds."</p>  
 <p>26 (53). ‘And then bed-fellows address one another: "Rise up, here is the cock calling me up." Whichever of the two first gets up shall first enter paradise: whichever of the two shall first, with well-washed hands, bring clean wood unto the Fire, the son of Ahura Mazda, the Fire, well pleased with him and not angry, and fed as it required, will thus bless him:</p>  
 <p>27 (58). ‘"May herds of oxen grow for thee, and increase of sons: may thy mind be master of its vow, may thy soul be master of its vow, and mayst thou live on in the joy of the soul all the nights of thy life."</p>  
 <p>‘This is the blessing which the Fire speaks unto him who brings him dry wood, well examined by the light of the day, well cleansed with godly intent.</p>  
 <p>28 (64). ‘And whosoever will kindly and piously present one of the faithful with a pair of these my Parôdar<i>s</i> birds, a male and a female, it is as though he had given <a name="fr_1007"></a><a href="#fn_995"><font size="1">1</font></a> a house with a hundred columns, a thousand beams, ten thousand large windows, ten thousand small windows.</p>  
 <p>29 (67). 'And whosoever shall give to my Parôdar<i>s</i> bird his fill of meat, I, Ahura Mazda, need not</p>

 <p>interrogate him any longer; he shall directly go to paradise.'</p>  <h3 align="center">III.</h3>  
 <p>30 (70). The holy Sraosha asked the Dru<i>g</i>, with his club uplifted against her: 'O thou wretched and wicked Dru<i>g</i>! Thou then, alone in the material world, dost bear offspring without any male coming unto thee?'</p>  
 <p>31 (74). Then the Dru<i>g</i> demon, the guileful one, answered: ‘O holy, tall-formed Sraosha! It is not so, nor do I, alone in the material world, bear offspring without any male coming unto me.</p>  
 <p>32 (77). ‘There are four males who are mine.</p>  
 <p>'And they make me conceive progeny as other males make their females.'</p>  
 <p>33 (78). The holy Sraosha asked the Dru<i>g</i>, with his club uplifted against her: 'O thou wretched and wicked Dru<i>g</i>! Who is the first of those males of thine?'</p>  
 <p>34 (79). Then the Dru<i>g</i> demon, the guileful one, answered: ‘O holy, tall-formed Sraosha! He is the first of my males who, being entreated by one of the faithful, does not give him anything, be it ever so little, of the riches he has treasured up <a name="fr_1008"></a><a href="#fn_996"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>35 (82). 'That man makes me conceive progeny as other males make their females.'</p>  
 <p>36 (83). The holy Sraosha asked the Dru<i>g</i>, with his club uplifted against her: 'O thou wretched and wicked Dru<i>g</i>! What is the thing that can counteract that?'</p>  
 <p>37 (84). Then the Dru<i>g</i> demon, the guileful one, answered: ‘O holy, tall-formed Sraosha! This is</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_197"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 197</font></a></p>  
 <p>the thing that counteracts it, namely, when a man unasked, kindly and piously, gives to one of the faithful something, be it ever so little, of the riches he has treasured up.</p>  
 <p>38 (87). 'He does thereby as thoroughly destroy the fruit of my womb as a four-footed wolf does, who tears the child out of a mother's womb.'</p>  
 <p>39 (88). The holy Sraosha asked the Dru<i>g</i>, with his club uplifted against her: 'O thou wretched and wicked Dru<i>g</i>! Who is the second of those males of thine?'</p>  
 <p>40 (89). Then the Dru<i>g</i> demon, the guileful one, answered ‘O holy, tall-formed Sraosha! He is the second of my males who, making water, lets it fall along the upper forepart of his foot.</p>  
 <p>41 (92). 'That man makes me conceive progeny as other males make their females.'</p>  
 <p>42 (93). The holy Sraosha asked the Dru<i>g</i>, with his club uplifted against her: 'O thou wretched and wicked Dru<i>g</i>! What is the thing that can counteract that?'</p>  
 <p>43 (94). Then the Dru<i>g</i> demon, the guileful one, answered: ‘O holy, tall-formed Sraosha!

 <p>44 (98). 'He does thereby as thoroughly destroy the fruit of my womb as a four-footed wolf does, who tears the child out of a mother's womb.'</p>  
 <p>45 (99). The holy Sraosha asked the Dru<i>g</i>, with his club uplifted against her: 'O thou wretched and wicked Dru<i>g</i>! Who is the third of those males of thine?'</p>  
 <p>46 (100). Then the Dru<i>g</i> demon, the guileful one, answered: ‘O holy, tall-formed Sraosha! He is the third of my males who during his sleep emits seed.</p>  
 <p>47 (102). 'That man makes me conceive progeny as other males make their females.'</p>  
 <p>48 (103). The holy Sraosha asked the Dru<i>g</i>, with his club uplifted against her: 'O thou wretched and wicked Dru<i>g</i>! What is the thing that can counteract that?'</p>  
 <p>49 (104). Then the Dru<i>g</i> demon, the guileful one, answered: ‘O holy, tall-formed Sraosha! this is the thing that counteracts it, namely, if the man, when he has risen from sleep, shall say three Ahuna-Vairya, two humatanãm, three hukhshathrôtemãm, and then chant the Ahuna-Vairya and offer up one Yê<i>n</i>hê hâtãm.</p>  
 <p>50 (107). 'He does thereby as thoroughly destroy the fruit of my womb as a four-footed wolf does who tears the child out of a mother's womb.'</p>  
 <p>51 (108). Then he shall speak unto Spe<i>n</i>ta Ârmaiti <a name="fr_1010"></a><a href="#fn_998"><font size="1">1</font></a>, saying: ‘O Spe<i>n</i>ta Ârmaiti, this man do I deliver unto thee; this man deliver thou back unto me, against the mighty day of resurrection; deliver him back as one who knows the Gâthas, who</p>

 <p>53 (113). The holy Sraosha asked the Dru<i>g</i>, with his club uplifted against her: 'O thou wretched and wicked Dru<i>g</i>! Who is the fourth of those males of thine?'</p>  
 <p>54 (114). Then the Dru<i>g</i> demon, the guileful one, answered: ‘O holy, tall-formed Sraosha! This one is my fourth male who, either man or woman, being more than fifteen years of age, walks without wearing the sacred girdle and the sacred shirt <a name="fr_1013"></a><a href="#fn_1001"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>

 <p>62 (124). Ahura Mazda answered: ‘It is the <i>G</i>ahi <a name="fr_1016"></a><a href="#fn_1004"><font size="1">1</font></a>, O Spitama Zarathu<i>s</i>tra! who goes a-whoring after the faithful and the unfaithful, after the worshippers of Mazda and the worshippers of the Daêvas, after the wicked and the righteous <a name="fr_1017"></a><a href="#fn_1005"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>

 <p>67-68 (133). Zarathu<i>s</i>tra asked Ahura Mazda: 'If a man shall come unto a woman who has an issue of blood, either out of the ordinary course or at the usual period, and he does so wittingly and knowingly <a name="fr_1022"></a><a href="#fn_1010"><font size="1">5</font></a>, and she allows it wilfully, wittingly, and</p>

 <p>69 (136). Ahura Mazda answered: ‘If a man shall come unto a woman who has an issue of blood, either out of the ordinary course or at the usual period, and he does so wittingly and knowingly, and she allows it wilfully, wittingly, and knowingly;</p>

 <p><a name="fn_973"></a><a href="sbe0424.htm#fr_985">189:3</a> The word translated girded is the word used of the Kôstî, the sacred girdle which the Parsi must never part with (see § 54); the full meaning, therefore, is, 'girded with the law as with a Kôstî' (cf. Yasna IX, 26 [81]), that is to say, 'never forsaking the law,' or, as the Commentary expresses it, 'one whose thought is all on the law' (cf. § 5).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_982"></a><a href="sbe0424.htm#fr_994">191:4</a> The Kôstî, which must be worn by every Parsi, man or woman, from their fifteenth year of age (see below, § 54 seq.); it is the badge of the faithful, the girdle by which he is united both with Ormazd and with his fellow believers. He who does not wear it must be refused water and bread by the members of the community; he who wears it becomes a participator in the merit of all the good deeds performed all over the Zarathustrian world (Saddar 10 and 46; Hyde 10 and 50). The Kôstî consists 'of seventy-two interwoven filaments, and should three times circumvent the waist. . . . Each of the threads is equal in value to one of the seventy-two Hâhs of the Izashnê; each of the twelve threads in the six lesser cords is equal in value to the dawâzdih hamâist . . .; each of the lesser cords is equal in value to one of the six Gahanbârs; each of the three circumventions of the loins is equal in value to humat, good thought, hukhat, good speech, huaresta, good work; the binding of each of the four knots upon it confers pleasure on each of the four elements, fire, air, water, and the earth' (Edal Daru, apud Wilson, The Parsi Religion Unfolded, p. 163). In the Brahmanical system also the faithful are bound to their god by means of a sacred girdle, the Mekhalâ.</p>  
 <p>Another piece of clothing which every Parsi is enjoined to wear is the Sadarah, or sacred shirt, a muslin shirt with short sleeves, that does not reach lower than the hips, with a small pocket at the opening in front of the shirt (see § 54 seq.)</p>

 <p><a name="fn_989"></a><a href="sbe0424.htm#fr_1001">193:3</a> The cock is called 'the drum of the world.' As crowing in the dawn that dazzles away the fiends, he shared with it the honour of the victory, and was believed to crow away the demons: 'The cock was created to fight against the fiends and wizards; . . . he is with the dog an ally of Srôsh against demons' (Bundahi<i>s</i> XIX) 'No demon can enter a house in which there is a cock: and, above all, should this bird come to the residence of a demon, and move his tongue to chaunt the praises of the glorious and exalted Creator, that instant the evil spirit takes to flight' (Mirkhond, History of the Early Kings of Persia, translated by Shea, p. 57; cf.
