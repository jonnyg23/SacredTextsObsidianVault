 <p><a name="fn_1143"></a><a href="sbe0427.htm#fr_1155">224:1</a> The primeval bull who was created by Ormazd and killed by Ahriman with the help of the <i>G</i>ahi. The praise of the holy bull serves as an introduction to the praise of the waters. There were old myths in which a cloud was compared to a bull in the atmosphere, from whom rain was supposed to come. (See Orm. Ahr. § 122 seq.; cf. Introd. V, 5. Clause 1 is to be recited when one meets an ox or any kind of cattle, Gr. Rav. 386.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1144"></a><a href="sbe0427.htm#fr_1156">224:2</a> Possibly, 'who dost kill the <i>G</i>ahi' (by means of gômêz).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1145"></a><a href="sbe0427.htm#fr_1157">224:3</a> The <i>G</i>ahi (see Farg. XX, 10) as bringing sickness (cf. Farg. VII, 59).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1146"></a><a href="sbe0427.htm#fr_1158">224:4</a> Names of diseases.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1147"></a><a href="sbe0427.htm#fr_1159">225:1</a> Waters and light are believed to flow from the same spring and in the same bed: 'As light rises up from Hara Berezaiti [Alborz, the mountain by which the earth is surrounded], so waters spring up from it and come back to it' (Bund. XX); every day the sun, moon, and stars rise up from Alborz, and every day all the waters on the earth come back together to the sea Vouru-kasha, and there collected come down again to the earth from the peaks of Alborz (Bund. VII, Gr. Rav. 431; cf. Farg. V, 15 seq.) As light comes from three different sources, the sun, the moon, and the stars, the waters are invoked three times, first in company with the sun, then with the moon, lastly with the stars, as if there should be three different movements of the rain connected with the three movements of light.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1148"></a><a href="sbe0427.htm#fr_1160">225:2</a> Waters come down from the sky to the earth and come up back from the earth to the sky (see Farg. V, 15 seq.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1149"></a><a href="sbe0427.htm#fr_1161">225:3</a> Doubtful.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1150"></a><a href="sbe0427.htm#fr_1162">225:4</a> 'If thou art a righteous man' (Comm.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1151"></a><a href="sbe0427.htm#fr_1163">225:5</a> The translation of this clause is doubtful.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1152"></a><a href="sbe0427.htm#fr_1164">226:1</a> Doubtful; the text is corrupt. The spell refers to the cleansing and generative power of the waters; cf. the invocation to Ardvî Sûra, Farg. VII, 16: the waters are supposed to make females fertile as they make the earth. This spell was probably pronounced to facilitate childbirth.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1153"></a><a href="sbe0427.htm#fr_1165">226:2</a> Or better, 'a female;' there are, in the text, two words for 'milk,' the one referring to the milk of women, the other to the milk of cows.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1154"></a><a href="sbe0427.htm#fr_1166">226:3</a> Doubtful.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1155"></a><a href="sbe0427.htm#fr_1167">226:4</a> When the bull died, 'what was bright and strong in his seed was brought to the sphere of the moon, and when it was cleansed there in the light of the astre, two creatures were shaped with it, a male and a female, from which came two hundred and seventy-two kinds of animals' (Bund. IV, X; cf. Orm. Ahr. §§ 125 and 127).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1156"></a><a href="sbe0427.htm#fr_1168">227:1</a> Doubtful.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1157"></a><a href="sbe0427.htm#fr_1169">227:2</a> When Ti<i>s</i>trya, the storm god who gives rain, became a star (see Introd. IV, 36), it was thought that there was a relation between the stars and rain.</p>
