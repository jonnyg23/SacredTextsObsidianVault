 <p>§§ 45, 46 belong better to the following Fargard.</p>  
 <p>The ceremony described in this Fargard is known among the Parsis as Barashnûm nû shaba, or 'nine nights’ Barashnûm,' because it lasts for nine nights (see § 35) <a name="fr_751"></a><a href="#fn_743"><font size="1">2</font></a>. It is the great purification, the most efficacious of all; it not only makes the defiled man clean, but it opens to him the heavens (see Farg. XIX, 33; cf. Introd. V, 16). So, although it was formerly intended only for the man defiled by the dead, it became, during the Parsi period, a pious work which might be performed without any corpse having been touched; nay, its performance was prescribed, once at least, at the time of the Nû zûdî (at the age of fifteen, when the young Parsi becomes a member of the community), in order to wash away the natural uncleanness that has been contracted in the maternal womb (Saddar 36, Hyde 40) <a name="fr_752"></a><a href="#fn_744"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  <h3 align="center">I a.</h3>

 <p>2 (4). Ahura Mazda answered: ‘A godly man, O Spitama Zarathu<i>s</i>tra! who speaks truth, who learns the Holy Word, and who knows best the rites of cleansing according to the law of Mazda <a name="fr_753"></a><a href="#fn_745"><font size="1">1</font></a>, such a man shall fell the trees off the surface of the ground on a space of nine Vîbâzus <a name="fr_754"></a><a href="#fn_746"><font size="1">2</font></a> square.</p>

While drawing the furrows the cleanser recites three Ashem-vohus ("holiness is the best of all good," &amp;c.), the Fravarânê ("I declare myself a worshipper of Mazda, a follower of Zarathu<i>s</i>tra, a foe of the fiend," &amp;c.), the Khshnûman of Serosh, and the Bâ<i>g</i> of Serosh; they must be drawn from the north' (Comm. ad § 32). The furrow, or kesh, plays a greater part in the Mazdean liturgy than in any other. By means of the furrow, drawn with proper spells, and according to the laws of spiritual war, man either besieges the fiend or intrenches himself against him (cf. Farg. XVII, 5). In the present case the Dru<i>g</i>, being shut up inside the kesh and thus excluded from the world outside, and being driven back, step by step, by the strength of the holy water and spells, finds at last no place of refuge but hell, and the world is freed from her presence.</p>
