 <p>This chapter would offer tolerable unity, but for a digression on medicine, which would be better placed as an introduction to the last three chapters, Sections II and IX, parts of which have already been found in Fargard V, are more suitably placed here. This chapter, as a whole, deals with the action of the Dru<i>g</i> Nasu, from the moment she takes hold of the corpse, and shows how and when the several objects she has defiled become clean, namely, clothes, wood, corn, earth, women, vessels, and cows.</p>  <h3 align="center">I.</h3>  
 <p>1. Zarathu<i>s</i>tra asked Ahura Mazda: 'O Ahura Mazda, most beneficent Spirit, Maker of the material</p>  
 <p><a name="page_75"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 75</font></a></p>  
 <p>world, thou Holy One! When a man dies, at what moment does the Dru<i>g</i> Nasu rush upon him <a name="fr_620"></a><a href="#fn_615"><font size="1">1</font></a>?'</p>  
 <p>2 (3). Ahura Mazda answered: ‘Directly after death, as soon as the soul has left the body, O Spitama Zarathu<i>s</i>tra! the Dru<i>g</i> Nasu comes and rushes upon him, from the regions of the north <a name="fr_621"></a><a href="#fn_616"><font size="1">2</font></a>, in the shape of a raging fly, with knees and tail sticking out, all stained with stains, and like unto the foulest Khrafstras <a name="fr_622"></a><a href="#fn_617"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>[3. 'On him she stays until the dog has seen the corpse <a name="fr_623"></a><a href="#fn_618"><font size="1">4</font></a> or eaten it up, or until the flesh-eating birds have taken flight towards it <a name="fr_624"></a><a href="#fn_619"><font size="1">5</font></a>. When the dog has seen it or eaten it up, or when the flesh-eating birds have taken flight towards it, then the Dru<i>g</i> Nasu rushes away to the regions of the north in the shape of a raging fly, with knees and tail sticking out, all stained with stains, and like unto the foulest Khrafstras.']</p>  
 <p>4 (5). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If the man has been killed by a dog, or by a wolf, or by witchcraft, or by the artifices of hatred <a name="fr_625"></a><a href="#fn_620"><font size="1">6</font></a>, or by falling down a precipice, or by the law <a name="fr_626"></a><a href="#fn_621"><font size="1">7</font></a>, or by a murderer, or by the noose <a name="fr_627"></a><a href="#fn_622"><font size="1">8</font></a>, how long after death does the Dru<i>g</i> Nasu come and rush upon the dead?</p>

 <p>5 (6). Ahura Mazda answered: 'At the next watch after death <a name="fr_628"></a><a href="#fn_623"><font size="1">1</font></a>, the Dru<i>g</i> Nasu comes and rushes upon the dead, from the regions of the north, in the shape of a raging fly, with knees and tail sticking out, all stained with stains, and like unto the foulest Khrafstras.'</p>  <h3 align="center">II <a name="fr_629"></a><a href="#fn_624"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</h3>  
 <p>6 (7). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If there be a number of men resting in the same place, on adjoining carpets, on adjoining pillows, be there two men near one another, or five, or fifty, or a hundred, close by one another; and of those people one happens to die; how many of them does the Dru<i>g</i> Nasu envelope with infection, pollution, and uncleanness?</p>  
 <p>7 (11). Ahura Mazda answered: ‘If the dead one be a priest, the Dru<i>g</i> Nasu rushes forth, O Spitama Zarathu<i>s</i>tra! she falls on the eleventh and defiles the ten.</p>  
 <p>‘If the dead one be a warrior, the Dru<i>g</i> Nasu rushes forth, O Spitama Zarathu<i>s</i>tra! she falls on the tenth and defiles the nine.</p>  
 <p>‘If the dead one be a husbandman, the Dru<i>g</i> Nasu rushes forth, O Spitama Zarathu<i>s</i>tra! she falls on the ninth and defiles the eight.</p>  
 <p>8 (17). ‘If it be a shepherd's dog, the Dru<i>g</i> Nasu rushes forth, O Spitama Zarathu<i>s</i>tra! she falls on the eighth and defiles the seven.</p>

 <p>‘If it be a house dog, the Dru<i>g</i> Nasu rushes forth, O Spitama Zarathu<i>s</i>tra! she falls on the seventh and defiles the six.</p>

 <p>11 (27). Ahura Mazda answered: 'The Dru<i>g</i> Nasu defiles with infection, uncleanness, and pollution the upper sheet and the inner garment <a name="fr_633"></a><a href="#fn_628"><font size="1">4</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>12 (28). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Can that garment be made clean, O holy Ahura Mazda! that has been touched by the carcase of a dog or the corpse of a man?</p>  
 <p>13 (29). Ahura Mazda answered: 'It can, O holy Zarathu<i>s</i>tra!'</p>  
 <p>How so?</p>

 <p>‘If, indeed, the garment has been defiled with seed, or sweat, or dirt, or vomit, the worshippers of Mazda shall rend it to pieces, and bury it under the ground <a name="fr_634"></a><a href="#fn_629"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>14 (33). ‘But if it has not been defiled with seed, or sweat, or dirt, or vomit, then the worshippers of Mazda shall wash it with gômêz.</p>  
 <p>15 (35). ‘If it be leather, they shall wash it with gômêz three times, they shall rub it with earth three times, they shall wash it with water three times, and afterwards they shall expose it to the air for three months at the window of the house.</p>  
 <p>‘If it be woven cloth, they shall wash it with gômêz six times <a name="fr_635"></a><a href="#fn_630"><font size="1">2</font></a>, they shall rub it with earth six times, they shall wash it with water six times, and afterwards they shall expose it to the air for six months at the window of the house.</p>  
 <p>16 (37). 'The spring named Ardvî Sûra, O Spitama Zarathu<i>s</i>tra! that spring of mine, purifies the seed in man, the fruit in a woman's womb, the milk in a woman's breast <a name="fr_636"></a><a href="#fn_631"><font size="1">3</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>17 <a name="fr_637"></a><a href="#fn_632"><font size="1">4</font></a> (41). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Can those clothes, when once washed and cleansed, ever be used either by a Zaotar, or by a Hâvanan, or by an Âtare-vakhsha, or by a Frabaretar, or by an Âbere<i>d</i>, or by an Âsnâtar, or by a Rathwi<i>s</i>kar, or by a Sraoshâ-varez, or by any priest, warrior, or husbandman?</p>

 <p><a name="page_79"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 79</font></a></p>  
 <p>18 (43). Ahura Mazda answered: ‘Never can those clothes, even when washed and cleansed, be used either by a Zaotar, or by a Hâvanan, or by an Âtare-vakhsha, or by a Frabaretar, or by an Âbere<i>d</i>, or by an Âsnâtar, or by a Rathwi<i>s</i>kar, or by a Sraoshâ-varez, or by any priest, warrior, or husbandman.</p>  
 <p>19 (45). ‘But if there be in a Mazdean house a woman who is in her sickness, or a man who has become unfit for work, and who must sit in the place of infirmity, those clothes shall serve for their coverings and for their sheets, until they can withdraw and move their hands.</p>  
 <p>20 (49). ‘Ahura Mazda, indeed, does not allow us to waste anything of value that we may have, not even so much as an Asperena's weight of thread, not even so much as a maid lets fall in spinning.</p>  
 <p>21 (52). ‘Whosoever throws any clothing on a dead body, even so much as a maid lets fall in spinning, is not a pious man whilst alive, nor shall he, when dead, have a place in the happy realm.</p>  
 <p>22 (55). 'He shall go away into the world of the fiends, into that dark world, made of darkness, the offspring of darkness. To that world, to the dismal realm, you are delivered by your own doings, by your own souls, O sinners!'</p>  <h3 align="center">IV.</h3>  
 <p>23 (59). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Can he be clean again who has eaten of the carcase of a dog or of the carcase of a man <a name="fr_638"></a><a href="#fn_633"><font size="1">1</font></a>?</p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_80"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 80</font></a></p>  
 <p>24 (60). Ahura Mazda answered: 'He cannot, O holy Zarathu<i>s</i>tra!

 <p>28 (72). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Can the wood be made clean, O holy Ahura Mazda! whereunto dead matter has been brought from a dead dog, or from a dead man?</p>

 <p>How so?</p>  
 <p>‘If the Nasu has not yet been smitten by the corpse-eating dogs, or by the corpse-eating birds, they shall lay down, apart on the ground, the corn on the length of a Frârâthni all around the dead matter, if the corn be dry; on the length of a Frâbâzu all</p>

What is the place whereon the troops of fiends rush together? What is the place whereon the troops of fiends come rushing along? What is the place whereon they rush together to kill their fifties and their hundreds, their hundreds and their thousands, their thousands and their tens of thousands, their tens of thousands and their myriads of myriads?</p>  
 <p>56 (138). Ahura Mazda answered: ‘Those Dakhmas that are built upon the face of the earth, O Spitama Zarathu<i>s</i>tra! and whereon are laid the corpses Of dead men, that is the place where the fiends are, that is the place whereon the troops of fiends rush together, that is the place whereon the troops of fiends come rushing along, that is the place whereon they rush together to kill their fifties and their hundreds, their hundreds and their thousands, their thousands and their tens of thousands, their tens of thousands and their myriads of myriads.</p>  
 <p>57 (140). ‘On those Dakhmas, O Spitama Zarathu<i>s</i>tra! those fiends take food and void filth, (eating up corpses) in the same way as you, men, in the material world, eat cooked meal and cooked meat. It is, as it were, the smell of their feeding that you smell there, O men!</p>  
 <p>58 (143). ‘Thus the fiends revel on there, until that stench is rooted in the Dakhmas. Thus from the Dakhmas arise the infection of diseases, itch, hot fever, humours <a name="fr_672"></a><a href="#fn_667"><font size="1">1</font></a>, cold fever, rickets, and hair untimely white.

If in the house of a worshipper of Mazda there be a woman with child, and if being a month gone, or two, or three, or four, or five, or six, or seven, or eight, or nine, or ten months gone, she bring forth a still-born child, what shall the worshippers of Mazda do?</p>  
 <p>61 (155). Ahura Mazda answered: 'The place in that Mazdean house whereof the ground is the cleanest and the driest, and the least passed through by flocks and herds, by Fire, the son of Ahura Mazda, by the consecrated bundles of baresma, and by the faithful;'--</p>  
 <p>62 (158). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! How far from the fire? How far from the water? How far from the consecrated bundles of baresma? How far from the faithful?</p>  
 <p>63 (159). Ahura Mazda answered: 'Thirty paces from the fire; thirty paces from the water; thirty paces from the consecrated bundles of baresma three paces from the faithful;'--</p>

 <p>65 (162). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! What is the food that the woman shall first take?</p>  
 <p>66 (163). Ahura Mazda answered: ‘She shall drink gômêz mixed with ashes, three cups of it, or six, or nine, to wash over the grave in her womb.</p>  
 <p>67 (166). 'Afterwards she may drink boiling milk of mares, cows, sheep, or goats, with pap or without pap; she may take cooked meat without water, bread without water, and wine without water.'</p>  
 <p>68 (169). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! How long shall she remain so? How long shall she live only on that sort of meat, bread, and wine?</p>  
 <p>69 (170). Ahura Mazda answered: 'Three nights long shall she remain so; three nights long shall she live on that sort of meat, bread, and wine. Then, when three nights have passed, she shall wash her body, she shall wash her clothes, with gômêz and water, by the nine holes, and thus shall she be clean.'</p>
