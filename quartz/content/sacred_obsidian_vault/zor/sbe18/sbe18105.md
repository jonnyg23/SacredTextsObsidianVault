Because the ancients have said that, when it shall be discarded from use, every water, fire, plant, righteous man, <i>and</i> animal, and all the creatures of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> are afflicted, diminished, and made to leap <i>away</i>. 3. As it is said in revelation that, <i>as to</i> him <i>who</i> stands <i>by</i> a dead body upon which the Nasû<i>s</i> <a name="fr_1123"></a><a href="#fn_1119"><font size="1">7</font></a> <i>has</i> rushed <a name="fr_1124"></a><a href="#fn_1120"><font size="1">8</font></a>, 'anusô zî, Spitama Zarathu<i>s</i>tra!</p>

 <p>4. When <i>there</i> is no purifier all the angels of the worldly <i>existence</i> become afflicted <i>and</i> dissatisfied; and religious purifiers who are intelligent are even now not to keep backward the work of purification, just as <i>it has</i> come to them by practice from those of the primitive faith, and are not to diminish it. 5. To change a good work properly appointed they shall not accept a law which is not right, a good work not properly appointed <a name="fr_1135"></a><a href="#fn_1131"><font size="1">4</font></a>; not to do the work thereof is accounted very sagacious <i>and</i> perfectly wise; and through your freedom from inferiority <a name="fr_1136"></a><a href="#fn_1132"><font size="1">5</font></a> the glorifying, commendation, praise, and blessing are your own. 6. For it is said that in all the work of forming and maintaining the law (dâ<i>d</i>istânŏ) those of the primitive faith <i>were</i> very greatly particular about every single thing; and <i>as to</i> the whole operation of that proceeding into which they <i>have</i> entered, those of the primitive faith have become aware of the power which <i>resides</i> in true authority. 7.

 <p>8.

And when, moreover, all the Avesta and Zand are easy <i>to</i> a priest <a name="fr_1147"></a><a href="#fn_1143"><font size="1">2</font></a>, pre-eminently acquainted with the liturgy <i>and</i> a supreme Zaratû<i>s</i>t, <i>he has</i> attained <i>unto, and</i> should remain with, Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> and <a name="fr_1148"></a><a href="#fn_1144"><font size="1">3</font></a> the officiating priestship of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, and the supreme, world-managing, religion-observing (hû-dîn nikah) sovereignty as to <i>religious</i> treatises <a name="fr_1149"></a><a href="#fn_1145"><font size="1">4</font></a>. 12. To change then their practice in the law would be entirely an outcry apart from deliberation, and a like violation of the unanimity of the spirits who are the heads <i>and</i> guardians <a name="fr_1150"></a><a href="#fn_1146"><font size="1">5</font></a> of the religion, <i>and of</i> the unanimity of the source of opinion of the good themselves, for the sake of <i>what is</i> not acceptable.</p>  
 <p>13. But the statement above <a name="fr_1151"></a><a href="#fn_1147"><font size="1">6</font></a> is, was, <i>and will</i> be that which remains a good idea well considered by them with the centre of thought, as to <i>its</i> well-operating</p>

 <p>characteristics, just contention, and complete powerfulness. 14. Also from the teaching of just high-priests, through the preservation of much evidence, and ascertained for the members of the assemblies of various provinces (shat<i>r</i>ô shat<i>r</i>ô), are shown the opinion <i>and</i> experience of most priestly men; and to make the various districts (kûstakŏ kûstakŏ) thrivingly steadfast, an unperverted <i>one</i> should be set up in all four quarters (pâ<i>d</i>kôs) of the same province.</p>  
 <p>15. And a semblance of it is apparent even from that which the glorified Nîshahpûhar, the supreme officiating priest <a name="fr_1152"></a><a href="#fn_1148"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and also other officiating priests of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> <i>have</i> said, <i>that one is</i> not to change any teaching of theirs thereon after <i>it is</i> provided, <i>and</i> not to render useless the statements of other authority thereon. 16. But that which they should accept <i>from</i> them as a certainty is to maintain the statements of other high-priests as pre-eminent; <i>and</i> not to change the operation of statements of another description <i>has</i> appeared lawful. 17. Even so it was as that <i>same</i> Nîshahpûhar, in the council of the glorified (anôshakŏ rûbânô) Khûsrô <a name="fr_1153"></a><a href="#fn_1149"><font size="1">2</font></a>, king of</p>

 <p>kings <i>and</i> son of Kavâ<i>d</i>,--by preserving old things (ligânŏ)--showed that way on whose thoughts they are established, and wrote them unaltered, so that such thoughts thereon became as <i>it were</i> decided; and their thoughts thereon, after such decree of his, have so become unanimous. 18. Through the importance <i>of his</i> assured rank, and the rest which was said by him in the work of sustaining the faithful, he maintains as much as the other statements, one <i>by</i> one, from the deliberative teaching of those high-priests.</p>

That man delights them, O Spitama Zarathu<i>s</i>tra! who cleanses from the Nasu those whom she has defiled; he delights the fire, he delights the water, he delights the earth, he delights the cow, he delights the trees, he delights the faithful, both men and women.' The Avesta text is given according to the standard edition of Westergaard (IX, 41, 42), and all variants of any importance, in the three MSS. here used, are mentioned in the notes. These passages are also referred to in Ep. II, iii, 5.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1148"></a><a href="sbe18105.htm#fr_1152">297:1</a> This môbad of môbads is mentioned in Pahl. Vend. III, 151, V, 112, VI, 71, VIII, 64, XVI, 10, 17, AV. I, 35, and twenty-four times in the Nîrangistân (see Sls. I, 4 n). His name is spelt in various ways.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1149"></a><a href="sbe18105.htm#fr_1153">297:2</a> King Khûsrô, son of Kavâ<i>d</i>, who is best known by his title Nôshirvân, or Anôshirvân, 'immortal-soulled,' reigned A.D. 531-579; and the statement that Nîshahpûhar was one of his councillors (made little more than three centuries after his death, and, therefore, probably correct) is of considerable importance for fixing a limit to the age of those Pahlavi books in which he is mentioned. These books are the Pahlavi Nîrangistân, a late recension of the Pahlavi Vendidâ<i>d</i>, and the Book of Ar<i>d</i>â-Vîrâf, in which last it is <a name="page_298"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 298</font></a> stated that Vîrâf was called by the name of Nikhshâpûr by some. From the statements made in our text it seems probable that the council was employed in revising the Pahlavi Vendidâ<i>d</i>, in which they were careful not to erase the opinions of older commentators, and thus confirmed their statements by their own authority. It is possible that this council was that mentioned in Byt. I, 7, where the name Nishâpûr also occurs, but whether it refers to a man or a city is not quite certain. This council, which seems to have been summoned for condemning the heresy of Mazdak, was held probably two or three years before Khûsrô came to the throne (see Nŏldeke: Geschichte der Perser and Araber zur Zeit der Sasaniden, p. 465).</p>
