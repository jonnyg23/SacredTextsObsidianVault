 <p>1. <i>As to</i> the sixty-seventh question <i>and</i> reply, that which you ask is thus: What is this which, when the sun and moon <i>have</i> both come up, is something <a name="fr_781"></a><a href="#fn_778"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>  
 <p>

 <p>come, <i>and</i> comes on as <i>it were</i> anew when it (the moon) becomes new, <i>and</i> men want the thing to go down from the place <i>where it</i> is becoming apparent? 2. When it <i>has</i> been several times, what is then the thing <i>which</i> comes up <i>and</i> exists, and how is its motion by night and day?</p>  
 <p>3. The reply is this, that the sun and moon are always seen <a name="fr_782"></a><a href="#fn_779"><font size="1">1</font></a> there where they stand, and they exist for men and the creatures. 4. The sun is swifter-moving <a name="fr_783"></a><a href="#fn_780"><font size="1">2</font></a> than the moon, <i>and</i> every day becomes a little in advance; at the new moon the sun is shining, and the moon owing to diminution backwards, on account of the slenderness of the moon by much travelling <a name="fr_784"></a><a href="#fn_781"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and on account of the brilliance of the sun, is not apparent. 5. As the sun goes down a light which is not very apparent is the moon, and not <i>having</i> gone down the moon is seen <a name="fr_785"></a><a href="#fn_782"><font size="1">4</font></a>; and each day the moon increases, comes up more behind the sun, <i>and</i> goes down more behind, <i>and</i> is, therefore, more seen. 6. When increased to the utmost, which is approaching a likeness of the sun, it comes spherical (aspiharakŏ), and is seen the whole night; to diminish anew it comes back to the companionship of the sun, and goes into the splendour of the sun.</p>

 <h3 align="CENTER">Footnotes</h3>
 <p><a name="fn_778"></a><a href="sbe18075.htm#fr_781">210:4</a> The only probable reading for this word is mindavam, 'a thing;' it occurs three times in this question, but is a very vague term for the phases of the moon, probably referring to a supposed body covering the dark part of the moon's disc.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_779"></a><a href="sbe18075.htm#fr_782">211:1</a> The MSS. have astî-hênd, 'have remained,' instead of khadîtunî-hênd, 'are seen;' but the difference between these words in Pahlavi letters is merely a medial stroke.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_780"></a><a href="sbe18075.htm#fr_783">211:2</a> Apparently so, as the moon rises and sets about 48 minutes later every day, on the average.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_781"></a><a href="sbe18075.htm#fr_784">211:3</a> A very anthropomorphic mode of accounting for the waning of the moon into a slender crescent.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_782"></a><a href="sbe18075.htm#fr_785">211:4</a> Most Orientals consider the day of the new moon to be that in the evening of which it is first possible to see the moon; this is usually the first, but sometimes the second, day after the actual change of the moon according to European ideas.</p>
