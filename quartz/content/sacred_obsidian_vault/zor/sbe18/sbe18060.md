 <p>1. <i>As to</i> the fifty-second question <i>and</i> reply, that which you ask is thus: <i>If</i> people of the good religion, in <i>their</i> country <i>or</i> out of <i>their</i> country, shall buy <i>and</i> sell with those of a different religion as regards cattle, <i>or</i> shall lay hold of traders (vanîkgarân) and shall sell to them, what is then the decision about it? 2. When <i>those of</i> the good religion shall not buy, as they have not come <i>up to</i> the price, but <i>the orthodox dealers</i> shall sell to traders <i>and</i> those of a different religion, what is then the decision about it? 3. <i>And</i> about him, of whom the means of existence (zîvi<i>s</i>nŏ mindavam) are such, what is then the decision?</p>  
 <p>4. The reply is this, that it would be very grievously sinful, and it would be an evil occupation to transact such business through the influence of opportunity, <i>and</i> to seek profit unauthorisedly in that manner. 5. But if <i>it be</i> the means of existence <i>of</i> those of the good religion <i>of</i> whom <i>you have</i> written, and <i>they</i> are not able to seek <i>it</i> in any other business <i>and</i> proper occupation which <i>would be</i> a less sinful meant of existence, complete <a name="fr_680"></a><a href="#fn_677"><font size="1">2</font></a> purchasers who <i>have</i> acquired</p>

 <p>the good religion shall sell unto those of the good religion <a name="fr_681"></a><a href="#fn_678"><font size="1">1</font></a>; because it is possible for him <i>to be</i> less sinful <i>to</i> whom <i>it</i> is allowable to beg the life of a comrade, for still the rule <i>of</i> a righteous man, with the righteous who are in his guardianship, is to live. 6. So it is possible, when they shall sell cattle for slaughter <i>and</i> foreign eating, many cattle--amounting even to a diminution of the maintenance of Irân--are more wretched than a righteous man forced to kill <i>them</i> through a living becoming unobtainable <i>and</i> the fear of death.</p>
