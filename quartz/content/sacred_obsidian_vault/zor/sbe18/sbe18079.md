 <p>1. <i>As to</i> the seventy-first question <i>and</i> reply, that which you ask is thus: What are the heinous sins of committing unnatural intercourse, is it proper to order <i>or</i> perform the <i>sacred</i> ceremony for him who shall commit unnatural intercourse, <i>and</i> is it then proper to practise sitting together and eating together with him who shall commit <i>it</i>, and shall commit <i>it with</i> a longing for it, or not?</p>  
 <p>2. The reply is this, that of the evil Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers <a name="fr_800"></a><a href="#fn_797"><font size="1">2</font></a>--who <i>were</i> the seven evil-doers of sin of a heinous kind <a name="fr_801"></a><a href="#fn_798"><font size="1">3</font></a>, whose practice of Aharman's <i>will was</i> as much as an approximation to <i>that of</i> </p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Aharman <i>himself</i>--two are those whom you have mentioned, who are defiled with mutual sin. 3. For, of those seven evil-doers, one <i>was</i> A<i>z</i>-î Dahâk <a name="fr_802"></a><a href="#fn_799"><font size="1">1</font></a>, by whom witchcraft <i>was</i> first glorified; he exercised the sovereignty of misgovernment, and desired a life of the unintellectual (ahangân khayâ) for the world. 4. One <i>was</i> A<i>z</i>î Sruvar <a name="fr_803"></a><a href="#fn_800"><font size="1">2</font></a>, by whom infesting the highway <i>in</i> terrible modes, frightful watchfulness (vîmag-bî<i>d</i>ârîh) <a name="fr_804"></a><a href="#fn_801"><font size="1">3</font></a> of the road, and devouring of horse <i>and</i> man <i>were</i> perpetrated. 5. One <i>was</i> Va<i>d</i>ak <a name="fr_805"></a><a href="#fn_802"><font size="1">4</font></a> the mother of Dahâk, by whom adultery <i>was</i> first committed, and by it all lineage is disturbed, control is put an end to, and without the authority of the husband an intermingling of son with son <a name="fr_806"></a><a href="#fn_803"><font size="1">5</font></a> occurs. 6.

 <p><i>in</i> the intercourse of males, the infecundity of which is the desire of men; and by him the intercourse of males <i>and</i> the way of destroying the seed <i>were</i> first shown unto males. 7. One <i>was</i> the Vîpînî<i>d</i>ak <a name="fr_808"></a><a href="#fn_805"><font size="1">1</font></a> ('pæderast'), the male by whom the use of females <i>was</i> first brought among the errors (khazdag) of the male, and <i>was</i> despised (dûkhtŏ) by him; he who is a cherisher of seed is delivering <i>it</i> to females, and that which is destroying the seed is the flowing of stenches into the prescribed vessels <a name="fr_809"></a><a href="#fn_806"><font size="1">2</font></a> for it, the delivering <i>it</i> to males by a demoniacal process, and carrying on a practice which effaces (âhan<i>g</i>ê<i>d</i>ŏ) <i>and</i> conceals the race <a name="fr_810"></a><a href="#fn_807"><font size="1">3</font></a> of the living. 8. One <i>was</i> Tûr-î Brâ<i>d</i>ar-vakhsh <a name="fr_811"></a><a href="#fn_808"><font size="1">4</font></a>, the Karap <i>and</i> heterodox wizard, by whom the best of men <i>was</i> put to death. 9. And one <i>was</i> he by whom the religions of apostates <a name="fr_812"></a><a href="#fn_809"><font size="1">5</font></a> <i>were</i> preferred--through the deceitfulness of the perverted text and interpretation <a name="fr_813"></a><a href="#fn_810"><font size="1">6</font></a> which they themselves utter--to the law which the righteous</p>

 <p>10. And they who are defiled by a propensity to stench are thereby welcoming the demons <i>and</i> fiends <a name="fr_814"></a><a href="#fn_811"><font size="1">1</font></a>, <i>and</i> are far from good thought <a name="fr_815"></a><a href="#fn_812"><font size="1">2</font></a> through vexing <i>it</i>; and a distance from them is <i>to be maintained</i> of necessity in sitting and eating with <i>them</i>, except so far as <i>it may be</i> opportune for the giving of incitement <i>by</i> words for withdrawing (pa<i>d</i>âli<i>s</i>nŏ) from <i>their</i> sinfulness, while converting <i>them</i> from that propensity. 11. <i>Should one</i> die, to order a ceremonial for him is indecorous, and to perform <i>it</i> would be unauthorised; but if <i>he were</i> to do <i>so</i> penitently <i>one</i> would then be authorised to perform his ceremonial after the three <i>nights</i> <a name="fr_816"></a><a href="#fn_813"><font size="1">3</font></a>, for it is the remedy for atonement of sin. 12. And so long as <i>he</i> is living <i>he</i> is in the contingencies (vakhtagânŏ) owing to the sickness through which <i>he</i> is in that way an infamous <i>one</i> (akhamî<i>d</i>âr), and <i>there</i> are no preventives (bôndagânŏ) and medicinal powder for it; these are teachings also for the duty and good works of a ceremonial for the soul <a name="fr_817"></a><a href="#fn_814"><font size="1">4</font></a>.</p>

The Pahlavi writers seem to have taken this epithet as a matronymic, owing to its form, but whether the mother's name be really traditional, or merely manufactured from the epithet, is doubtful.</p>
