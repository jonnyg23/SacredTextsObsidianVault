 <p>1. The twenty-seventh question is that which you ask thus: Why and what is <i>the ceremony of</i> </p>  
 <p><a name="page_59"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 59</font></a></p>  
 <p>the three <i>nights</i> (satûîh), when during three days they order and perform the sacred-cake ceremony (ya<i>z</i>i<i>s</i>nŏ drônô) of Srôsh <a name="fr_176"></a><a href="#fn_175"><font size="1">1</font></a>?</p>  
 <p>2. The reply is this, that the life and soul, when from the realm of the spirit of air <a name="fr_177"></a><a href="#fn_176"><font size="1">2</font></a> they attain unto worldly attire, and have passed into its pain and misfortune, are more sensitive (nâ<i>z</i>ûktar); owing to their nurture, birth, <i>and</i> mission, protection and defence are more desirable and more suitable for the discreet (hû-<i>k</i>îragânîktar); and milk food, and renewed (navagûnak) and constant attention to the fire are requisite  <a name="fr_178"></a><a href="#fn_177"><font size="1">3</font></a>. 3. So also when they are ousted from bodily existence, and pain and the eradication of life have come upon them, <i>they</i> are <i>in</i> like manner more sensitive, and sending them protection and defence from spirits <i>and</i> worldly existences is more desirable. 4. And on account of their spiritual character the offering (firî<i>s</i>ti<i>s</i>nŏ) of gifts <i>for</i> the angels, fit for the ritual of a spirit (maînôk nîrangîk), is more presentable; and also a fire newly tended (nôgônd) is that which is more the custom in the <i>sacred</i> ceremony (ya<i>z</i>i<i>s</i>nŏ).</p>  
 <p>5. <i>For</i> the same reason <i>in</i> the three days when in connection with the soul the <i>sacred</i> ceremony, the burning of fire, <i>its</i> cleanly clearance (gôndi<i>s</i>nŏ),</p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_60"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 60</font></a></p>  
 <p><i>and</i> other religious <i>and</i> ritualistic defence, feeding on milk <i>and</i> eating with a spoon <a name="fr_179"></a><a href="#fn_178"><font size="1">1</font></a> are ordered, because--as the <i>sacred</i> ceremony, the defence and protection of the worldly existences, is, by order of the creator, the business of Srôsh the righteous <a name="fr_180"></a><a href="#fn_179"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and <i>he</i> is also one of <i>those</i> taking the account in the three <i>nights</i> <a name="fr_181"></a><a href="#fn_180"><font size="1">3</font></a>--Srôsh the righteous gives the soul, <i>for</i> three days and nights, the place of the spirit of air in the world, and protection. 6. And because of the protectiveness of Srôsh, and <i>that one</i> is assisted likewise by Srôsh's taking the account, and for that purpose, are the manifest reasons for performing <i>and</i> ordering the ceremony of Srôsh <i>for</i> three days and nights <a name="fr_182"></a><a href="#fn_181"><font size="1">4</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>7. And the fourth day the ordering and performing the ceremony of the righteous guardian spirit (ar<i>d</i>âî fravar<i>d</i>ŏ) <a name="fr_183"></a><a href="#fn_182"><font size="1">5</font></a> are <i>for</i> the same soul and the remaining righteous guardian spirits of those who are <i>and</i> were <i>and will</i> be, from Gâyômar<i>d</i> the propitious to Sôshâns the triumphant <a name="fr_184"></a><a href="#fn_183"><font size="1">6</font></a>.</p>
