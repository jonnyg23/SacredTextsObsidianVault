 <p>1. When at <i>any</i> time I write more pleasantly, this directs <i>you</i> to understand that still with the steadfast, are my affection and natural lowly-mindedness; afterwards, too, that which <i>happens</i> when you have kept me wide away from the way of brotherhood, and higher even than a father, master, leader, ruler, <i>or</i> high-priest, is due to the fame and happiness of</p>  
 <p><a name="page_349"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 349</font></a></p>  
 <p>my body <i>and</i> life, not <i>to</i> affection of character, but the position of religion <i>and</i> the command of the sacred beings. 2. On that account, when you have seen the pure religiousness, the learned knowledge, <i>and</i> the repose-promoting truth of the invisible (avênâpîh) <i>of</i> which my <a name="fr_1357"></a><a href="#fn_1352"><font size="1">1</font></a> heart is leaping with evidence, so that you are steadfast even unto the nôi<i>d</i> asta-<i>k</i>a ('not though the body') <i>of</i> which Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtamân spoke <a name="fr_1358"></a><a href="#fn_1353"><font size="1">2</font></a>--and, because, turned by me to the religion which is thy passport (parvânakŏ) to the best existence, you have understood <i>that</i> it is the organizer of the greatest protection, <i>even</i> that is supposed by me--I undergo all the terror of the period in hope of the supreme recompense.</p>  
 <p>3. And the position that that religion <i>has</i> given, which on that account is mine, you have that way considered as supremacy <a name="fr_1359"></a><a href="#fn_1354"><font size="1">3</font></a>; and if, sent from you or another person, the opposition of <i>one of</i> the same religion is seen <i>to be</i> the dispersion and disruption of the appointed profession, I act against the continuance of the opposition, and as steadfastly as the series (zarah) of submissiveness and gratification of <i>your</i> priestly lordship <i>has</i> done to me. 4. And this <i>will</i> be undoubtedly realised by you, that if you do not turn away from this decree which is not preservative, but, <i>being</i> appointed, I reach out from</p>

 <p>the country of Irân <a name="fr_1360"></a><a href="#fn_1355"><font size="1">1</font></a>, then I <i>shall</i> become its greatest attacker of you. 5. And so I consider that from my opposition it is possible <i>for</i> more harm to happen unto you than from many accusers who are like the leader of those of the good religion, the many who are as <i>it were</i> of like fame with me.</p>  
 <p>6. And also from my departure, and the non-existence <i>of one</i> that is a friend of yours, who, like me, is less able to be for your harm than he who is <i>one</i> of the many accusers of whom it is I who am the restrainer, you know this, that my coming is on account of the affection of some and the reverence of others. 7. From the exercise of religion I do not at all fall <i>away</i>, and for the sake of the position of the religion I am maintaining opposition <a name="fr_1361"></a><a href="#fn_1356"><font size="1">2</font></a> to any one; even when he is a friend <i>who</i> is loved by me, I am then his antagonist 8. Fate (zîkŏ) <a name="fr_1362"></a><a href="#fn_1357"><font size="1">3</font></a> is the great truth of the vacant, the form (andâm) <a name="fr_1363"></a><a href="#fn_1358"><font size="1">4</font></a> which <i>has</i> procured the light of life.</p>
