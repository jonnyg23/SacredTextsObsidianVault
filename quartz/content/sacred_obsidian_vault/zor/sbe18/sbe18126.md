 <p>THE great ceremony of purification for any Parsi man or woman who has become unclean by contact with the dead, or through any other serious defilement, lasts for nine nights, and is called the Bareshnûm, which is the Avesta name for the 'top' of the head, the first part of the body appointed to be washed in the ceremony, after the hands. The description of this ceremony, given in Pahl. Vend. IX, I-145, which does not differ very materially from the rite still in use, is as follows <a name="fr_1602"></a><a href="#fn_1596"><font size="1">1</font></a>:--</p>  
 <p>Pahl. Vend. IX, 1. Zaratû<i>s</i>t enquired of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> thus: 'O Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, propitious spirit! creator of the material world! who art the righteous <i>one</i> [of righteousness!' that is, Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> is the righteous creator through invocation, <i>and</i> the rest through praise]. 2. 'How, when in the material existence they see a [clean] man together with [that which is polluted], (3) how shall they purify him clean who</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_432"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 432</font></a></p>  
 <p>is with <i>that</i> fraught with corruption [together with pollution] owing to that dead body? [that is, how should they make <i>him</i> thoroughly clean?]'</p>  
 <p>4. And Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: 'A righteous man, O Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtamân! [a purifier], (5) who is a speaker [that is, it is possible for him to speak], a true-speaker [that is, falsehood is little spoken by him], an enquirer of the liturgy [that is, the ritual is performed by him], <i>and</i> righteous, (6) he who specially understands the purification of the religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers [that is, he knows the rite], (7) such a one shall cut up the plants on the fruitful earth, (8) <i>for</i> a length of nine separate reeds <a name="fr_1603"></a><a href="#fn_1597"><font size="1">1</font></a> in every one of the four directions, (9) <i>at a place</i> on this earth which is most devoid of water, most devoid of trees, land most purified [from bodily refuse] <a name="fr_1604"></a><a href="#fn_1598"><font size="1">2</font></a>, <i>and</i> with the driest ground [that is, there is no damp in that extent of it]. to. Even <i>where</i> least upon the paths do cattle and beasts of burden step forth, and the fire of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, the sacred twigs <a name="fr_1605"></a><a href="#fn_1599"><font size="1">3</font></a> spread forth with righteousness, and the righteous man <a name="fr_1606"></a><a href="#fn_1600"><font size="1">4</font></a> <i>do least exist</i>.'</p>  
 <p>11. 'Creator of the material world! <i>thou</i> righteous <i>one</i>! how far from the fire? how far from the water? how far from the sacred twigs spread forth</p>

 <p>with righteousness? how far from a man of the righteous?'</p>  
 <p>12. And Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke thus: 'Thirty steps <a name="fr_1607"></a><a href="#fn_1601"><font size="1">1</font></a> from the fire, thirty steps from the water, thirty steps from the sacred twigs spread forth with righteousness, and three steps <a name="fr_1608"></a><a href="#fn_1602"><font size="1">2</font></a> from the men of the righteous. 13.

 <p>6. 'The rutting out of the three other holes [which are for water, (17) after the coming on of summer, is as much as two finger-<i>breadths</i> in excavation; after the coming on of hail-fraught winter <i>it</i> is as much as four finger-<i>breadths</i>.'</p>

 <p>24. 'Then, afterwards, is the ploughing up of the twelve furrows. 25. <i>By</i> the ploughing up of three from among <i>them</i> three holes are separated within <i>them</i>. 26.

 <p>detail of driving the fiend of corruption from one part of the body to another (by sprinkling with 'the good waters') till it flies away to the north as in Vend. IX, 117. But it omits the description of the purifier, the dimensions of the purifying place, the scoring of the furrows, the placing of the stones, the exorcism <a name="fr_1688"></a><a href="#fn_1682"><font size="1">1</font></a>, the seclusion for nine nights, and all the washings after the first day.</p>  
 <p>The other account, which is much shorter., is given in Vend. XI X, 67-84. It specifies that the urine must be that of a young bull, and that the purifier must score a furrow; it mentions the recitation of a hundred Ashem-vohûs and two hundred Yathâ-ahû-vairyôs, four washings with bull's urine and two with water, nine nights' exposure, followed by attention to the fire and fumigation, when the man clothes himself while paying homage to the sacred beings, and is clean; but no other details are given.</p>

The readings adopted are those of L4, wherever they are not defective; this MS. was written about A.D. 1324, and differs occasionally from Spiegel's printed text; it begins the ninth fargar<i>d</i> with the following heading:--'May it be fortunate! may it destroy the corruption (nasû<i>s</i>) which rushes on from a dead dog and men on to the living!

This diminution of distance enables a purifying priest to stand near enough to an unclean person to hand him the purifying liquid in a ladle tied to a stick (see §§ 40-42), without going within the furrows traced around the holes or ablution seats at the same distance of three steps (see §§ 21-23).</p>

The urine should he that of a bull, according to Vend. XIX, 70; but Vend.

At the present time the term magh, which means 'a hole' in the Avesta, is applied to the stones which are used as ablution seats for squatting upon.</p>

This row of nine holes, from north to south (see § 232, <i>e</i>), is surrounded by three furrows, the first six holes and the last three are both surrounded by a second series of three furrows, and the first three holes are surrounded by a third series of three furrows. And these furrows are not less than three steps from the holes in any place, except where they separate the three series of holes from each other. The object of the furrows, which are scored during the recitation of certain formulas (see § 132, <i>f</i>, <i>g</i>), is to prevent the fiend of corruption from forcing its way from the unclean person within the furrows to any other person outside them. And, as the fiend is supposed to be strongest at first, and to become gradually weakened by the progress of the purification (see § 119), the first three holes are surrounded by the strongest barrier of nine furrows.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1608"></a><a href="sbe18126.htm#fr_1614">436:2</a> There were three such spaces, one between the furrows and the first hole, one between the sixth and seventh holes, and one between the last hole and the furrows (see the plan). It is not distinctly stated that these stones were to be distributed, as ablution seats, to each of the nine stations, as at present; but this was probably intended. At the present time an additional group of stones is placed outside the furrows, at the entrance to the north, as a station for the preliminary washing.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1609"></a><a href="sbe18126.htm#fr_1615">436:3</a> That is, the priest is to stand outside, to the right (see § 132, <i>i</i>), but close to the furrows.</p>

It would seem as if a smaller supply of liquid were requisite for the ears than for the other customary parts, so that a quarter of the supply is directed to be returned to the vessel holding the liquid. The remarks made by the Pahlavi translator, upon the sprinkling of the left-hand members of the body, are evidently intended also to apply, in nearly all cases, to the sprinkling of the right-hand members.</p>
