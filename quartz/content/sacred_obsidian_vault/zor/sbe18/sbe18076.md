 <p>1. <i>As to</i> the sixty-eighth question <i>and</i> reply, that which you ask is thus: When <i>something</i> takes hold of the moon <i>or</i> sun what is then its residence (khânŏ), <i>and</i> whence does it always seize upon <i>it?</i></p>  
 <p>2. The reply is this, that two dark progeny of the <i>primeval</i> ox <a name="fr_786"></a><a href="#fn_783"><font size="1">1</font></a> move and are made to revolve from far below the sun and moon, and whenever, during the revolution of the <i>celestial</i> sphere, they make <i>one</i> pass below the sun, or below the moon, it becomes a covering which is spun (ta<i>d</i>) over the sun, <i>and</i> it is so when the sun or moon is not seen. 3. Of each of those two progeny of the <i>primeval</i> ox--one of which is called 'the head,' and one 'the tail'--the motion is specified among astronomers <a name="fr_787"></a><a href="#fn_784"><font size="1">2</font></a>; but <i>in</i> remaining upon those luminaries, and producing that covering, they do not attain unto those luminaries</p>

 <p>within that covering. 4. <i>There</i> occurs no difference whatever of the descending <i>rays</i> <a name="fr_788"></a><a href="#fn_785"><font size="1">1</font></a> from those luminaries into a place of purity and freedom from disturbance far below those luminaries, except this, that the light which they divert to the world, and their activity as regards the <i>celestial</i> spheres are not complete <i>for</i> so much time, <i>nor</i> the coming <a name="fr_789"></a><a href="#fn_786"><font size="1">2</font></a> of the light to the earth.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_783"></a><a href="sbe18076.htm#fr_786">212:1</a> Supposing the reading should be 2-ân gô<i>k</i>îhar-î târ here, and 2-ân gô<i>k</i>îharân in § 3. Gô<i>k</i>îhar is a supposed planetary (and, therefore, malevolent) body, connected with the sun and moon and having a head and tail, which falls on to the earth at the resurrection (see Bd. V, 1, XXVIII, 44, XXX, 18), and is here described as the cause of eclipses. Its name implies that it sprang from, or contained, the seed of the primeval ox, the supposed source of animal life (see Bd. XIV, 3), and in its Av. form, gao<i>k</i>ithra, it is a common epithet of the moon; in Pers. it has become gôzihr or gava<i>z</i>kihr. As the words stand in K35 they look more like 2 andô<i>g</i> dâlan-î târ, 'two dark store-lobbies,' or 2 andô<i>g</i> gâl-î târ, 'two clusters of dark spiders;' and in § 3 the word han<i>k</i>înŏ is substituted for the nearly synonymous andô<i>g</i>. In M14 the words seem to be 2 ângûn <i>k</i>îharânŏ-î târ, 'two such dark faces.'</p>
