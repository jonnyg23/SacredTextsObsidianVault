 <p>1. <i>As to</i> the sixty-fifth question <i>and</i> reply, that which you ask is thus: <i>There is</i> a man of wealth of the good religion who fully intends to order a <i>celebration of</i> all <i>the rites</i> of his religion; and a priest of it, to whom the five chapters (fragar<i>d</i>ŏ) of the Avesta ('text') of the correct law of the Nîrangistân ('religious-formula code') <a name="fr_746"></a><a href="#fn_743"><font size="1">3</font></a> are easy through the Zand commentary'), is ever progressing in priestly manhood (magôî-gab<i>r</i>âîh). 2. And he (the man) goes unto him, and he (the priest) speaks thus: 'All the religious rites are <i>performed</i> for 350 <i>dirhams</i> <a name="fr_747"></a><a href="#fn_744"><font size="1">4</font></a>, as a gift always given beforehand by them <i>who</i> give the order unto me, so that I <i>may</i> come to <i>them</i>.'</p>  
 <p>3. A man of the disciples <a name="fr_748"></a><a href="#fn_745"><font size="1">5</font></a>, to whom the five</p>

 <p><a name="page_202"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 202</font></a></p>  
 <p>sections (vîdag) of the Avesta are easy, and no-thing whatever of its Zand is easy <a name="fr_749"></a><a href="#fn_746"><font size="1">1</font></a>, then says unto him--unto that man who intends to order all the religious rites--thus: 'For this gift I will conduct all the religious rites for thee twice, with the appliances in the land of Pârs <a name="fr_750"></a><a href="#fn_747"><font size="1">2</font></a>, shouldst thou give the order unto me. 4. For it is quite possible for me to pray so many sections through my own exertion (dastŏ), <i>but</i> for him <a name="fr_751"></a><a href="#fn_748"><font size="1">3</font></a> it is necessary to order again of an officiating priest (pavan zôtakŏ), who is himself not able to pray any section, <i>or</i> does not himself pray; and it is not necessary for him to go for the control (parvâr) <a name="fr_752"></a><a href="#fn_749"><font size="1">4</font></a> of all the religious rites when a stipend (bâhar) is the one consideration within him, <i>and</i> the matter is <i>that</i> he <a name="fr_753"></a><a href="#fn_750"><font size="1">5</font></a> <i>may</i> receive again. 5. <i>He</i> who <i>has</i> always himself prayed is better than he who shall accept readily <i>and</i> orders <i>the work</i> again, and is not able to pray it himself, when a fulfilment is tedious to him; when <i>it</i> is I who <a name="fr_754"></a><a href="#fn_751"><font size="1">6</font></a> receive, I always pray myself better than he who would accept readily <i>and</i> orders again, and it brings on my business to a <i>closing</i> point.'</p>  
 <p>6. The priestly man speaks thus: 'The consideration</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_203"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 203</font></a></p>  
 <p>of stipend is more necessary to arise <i>with</i> me than <a name="fr_755"></a><a href="#fn_752"><font size="1">1</font></a> other men, owing to the position of religion, not the other portion (<i>s</i>ânŏ) of all religious rites; therefore, it is more authorisedly received <i>and</i> conducted by me when I accept readily and again intrust <i>the work</i>; but I direct so that they pray thoroughly, and it brings on much business to its <i>closing</i> point; moreover, <i>if</i> I seize upon it, even then I should be authorised, for this is the stipend of religion.'</p>  
 <p>7. Should they seize this that is authorisedly theirs, or not? <i>And</i> is <i>it</i> the custom of a man who is frequently ordering all the religious rites to reduce his gift for the ceremonial, or not?</p>  
 <p>8. Order <i>some one</i> to decide for us clearly, when they do not dispute the gift <i>for</i> the ceremonial, or <i>when</i> they do dispute <i>it</i>, how is then its great advantage; <i>and</i> the harmfulness that exists therein, in many ways <i>and</i> many modes, when they give an insufficient gift for the ceremonial. 9. Is the property which is given up as a gift for the ceremonial--so long as it thus becomes the remuneration which <i>one</i> gives to a receiver of remuneration (mozdô-bar)--that property which they can seize? 10. And is the work which is done, <i>or</i> deputed, and its great advantage, more than they would perform when, in the period of the evil millenniums <a name="fr_756"></a><a href="#fn_753"><font size="1">2</font></a>, they diminish the gift for the ceremonial; <i>and</i> in how many modes</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_204"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 204</font></a></p>  
 <p>does its harm then proceed therefrom? 11. Of whom are all the religious rites always more authorisedly ordered; of that priestly man, or of that disciple? 12. <i>For</i> what reason, also, is it proper to diminish the gift for all the religious rites of him who is a priestly man, or to give <i>it</i> in excess? 13. When they do not diminish the gift for the ceremonial, and <i>it</i> is given in excess, in what manner does its great advantage then arise therefrom; <i>and</i> why <i>and</i> through what source (bêkh) is it possible <i>for</i> advantage to arise therefrom? 14. When they diminish the gift what harm to it (the ceremonial) is then possible to arise therefrom, <i>and</i> how is <i>it</i> better when they give the gift for the ceremonial?</p>  
 <p>15. For when the family householders, with those of the good religion of Irân, are early (pê<i>s</i>) <i>with</i> every single <i>celebration of</i> all the religious rites with holy-water, in the land of Pârs, unless they are in distress, their gift is then 400 dirhams <a name="fr_757"></a><a href="#fn_754"><font size="1">1</font></a>; and we have given more than this, <i>even</i> 450 dirhams <a name="fr_758"></a><a href="#fn_755"><font size="1">2</font></a>, for it. 16. And now should it be needful, when we diminish anything from the 400 dirhams, or from the 450 <a name="fr_759"></a><a href="#fn_756"><font size="1">3</font></a> dirhams, of their gift, they would then not accept <i>it</i> from us, <i>and</i> they speak thus: 'For 400 dirhams, or <i>at</i> least for 350 dirhams <a name="fr_760"></a><a href="#fn_757"><font size="1">4</font></a>; nothing less do we</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_205"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 205</font></a></p>  
 <p>accept.' 17. <i>But</i> there are needy <i>men</i> <a name="fr_761"></a><a href="#fn_758"><font size="1">1</font></a> who always come to us <i>and</i> speak thus: 'For 350 dirhams we will twice conduct all the religious rites with holy-water <a name="fr_762"></a><a href="#fn_759"><font size="1">2</font></a>, as you have always ordered us before for 400 dirhams; order <i>it</i> only of us, <i>for</i> shouldst thou have <i>it</i> managed by priestly men, they always say that they should always perform a curtailment (kâstârîh) of the religious rites and ceremonies of the sacred beings, <i>and</i> that all the religious rites are not authorisedly ordered except of them.'</p>  
 <p>18. Although a priest (aêrpatŏ) who becomes a ruler of the ceremonial should be doubly a decider, yet order <i>some one</i> to explain to us clearly concerning these questions, as asked by us.</p>  
 <p>19. The reply is this, that the <i>man</i> of the good religion who intended to order all the religious rites is he whose desire is goodness, and he should be a decider of questions about it.</p>  
 <p>20. <i>As to</i> the priest who spoke thus:--'Thou shouldst order <i>it</i> of me for 350 <a name="fr_763"></a><a href="#fn_760"><font size="1">3</font></a> dirhams, as you have always given before your business <i>was arranged</i>; <i>and</i> it becomes your own non-religious share of the duty, to be authorisedly given, because you have proceeded with the alleged demeanour of the country, <i>and</i> for the purpose of intercession; and all the</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_206"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 206</font></a></p>  
 <p>religious rites with holy-water are such as they solemnize repeatedly (pavan dôr), among which there are many in which <a name="fr_764"></a><a href="#fn_761"><font size="1">1</font></a> I <i>act</i> and <i>am</i> very well performing'--the gift of 350 dirhams is then not excessive remuneration for him.</p>  
 <p>21. <i>As to</i> the disciple who spoke thus:--'For 350 dirhams I will <i>twice</i> <a name="fr_765"></a><a href="#fn_762"><font size="1">2</font></a> conduct all the religious rites in the land <a name="fr_766"></a><a href="#fn_763"><font size="1">3</font></a> of Pârs'--such of them as they then conduct repeatedly are not many in the aggregate (<i>k</i>înakŏ), and they certainly damage his (the man's) property, and all the religious rites of fire, through that deficiency. 22. And they would accept it on this account, that through a love of righteousness they might cause an advantage (khan<i>g</i>înakŏ) unto all those religious rites by their own inferior eminence <a name="fr_767"></a><a href="#fn_764"><font size="1">4</font></a>. 23. And he extends <i>and</i> impels the ceremonial of the sacred beings into much progress who promotes it through that eminence which is owing to his own wealth, <i>and</i> which is thus more possessed of a share (bôn) of the ceremonial of the sacred beings and of the good work of praise--except, indeed, a like good work of praise of his--when they shall cause that manifestation of eminence <a name="fr_768"></a><a href="#fn_765"><font size="1">5</font></a>. 24. So that the orderer of the good work understands that that which is diminished by him <a name="fr_769"></a><a href="#fn_766"><font size="1">6</font></a> is the eminence</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_207"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 207</font></a></p>  
 <p>of the disciple, which his own wealth <i>has</i> to order for those who are not able to give wealth which is their own property for it; <i>and</i> he makes no curtailment (ban<i>g</i>i<i>s</i>nŏ) of those scanty remunerations.</p>  
 <p>25. And if that disciple should accept as remuneration less than is the custom <i>for</i> all the religious rites, <i>the orderer</i> is not undiminished in wealth <a name="fr_770"></a><a href="#fn_767"><font size="1">1</font></a>, for the reason that the good effect owing to the advantage of holy-water is such as <i>when</i> they conduct <i>them</i> repeatedly, unless it be necessary to conduct <i>them</i> in a manner as <i>if</i> unpaid (pavan aga<i>z</i>î<i>d</i>). 26. That curtailment of the good effect is not afterwards demandable (pasîn-sakhunîkŏ), if it <i>has</i> to be accepted by him; <i>and</i> if that acceptance of less remuneration by him be an opposing of him to the malice and ill-temper (vushâî) of the priests, this also is not <i>the way</i> that they should cause progress as regards their own <i>business</i>.</p>  
 <p>27. And the proximity (nazdîh) of a master of the house <a name="fr_771"></a><a href="#fn_768"><font size="1">2</font></a> <i>who</i> keeps away from all the religious rites requested <i>and</i> accepted--more particularly when the accepter accepts all the religious rites of the requester for that remuneration--is itself necessary; he may not be of a religious disposition, but it is yet requisite <i>for him</i> to be where this is requested</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_208"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 208</font></a></p>  
 <p>and accepted for that scanty remuneration of his, owing to the extent and impetus of <i>his</i> share of the duty.</p>  
 <p>28. Moreover, it is perceived by us in Pârs <i>that</i> they who would accept the work for half the remuneration which was requisite as profit for it formerly would seize the remuneration. 29. And the reason of it is this:--The peasants relied upon the corn of the field (khânŏ) <i>which</i> has not come, <i>and they</i> said: 'We are hurried; we never obtain <i>anything</i> even on a single one of various debts, and by this payment we <i>shall</i> save <i>our</i> lives for the time; so we calculate that whatever we seize in the manner of a debt or two, when the corn arrives <i>and</i> we sell the corn, we <i>shall</i> make <i>as</i> profit on that business <a name="fr_772"></a><a href="#fn_769"><font size="1">1</font></a>;'--and it seemed to me very desirable <i>for</i> such a man.</p>  
 <p>30. If, also, they should approve that scanty remuneration of that disciple, it is an injury of all the religious rites, of which the forgivers  <a name="fr_773"></a><a href="#fn_770"><font size="1">2</font></a> <i>have</i> to cast the consideration of the unequally-shared advantage out of the body <a name="fr_774"></a><a href="#fn_771"><font size="1">3</font></a>. 31. All the religious rites ordered of him who is a better performer, owing to not diminishing the proper remuneration, <i>having</i> proceeded unaltered, the remuneration of righteousness <i>one</i> does not approve is important as regards such as they solemnize and conduct in the period <a name="fr_775"></a><a href="#fn_772"><font size="1">4</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_209"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 209</font></a></p>  
 <p>32. Since, for the 350 dirhams, all the religious rites which they conduct once with holy-water are, it is affirmed, all the religious rites caused to be conducted twice with holy-water in that same place <i>and with</i> the same good effect, it is more important to order of <i>them</i> who shall allow all the religious rites twice; for, with as much wealth, as much efficiency, and as much good effect, more ceremonial is good.</p>  
 <p>33. The worthiness of the disciple, which is owing to himself, is the preparation; <i>and</i> the priest is worthy, of whose performance in the religion <i>you have</i> spoken <a name="fr_776"></a><a href="#fn_773"><font size="1">1</font></a>; therefore, supreme worthiness is unattainable by either of them; so it is more significant when the disciple is the preparer, <i>and</i> the priest, <i>as</i> director, becomes a demander of good effect; both strive for good progress, <i>and</i> through many kinds of participation they may be worthy. 34. And both of them, praising together--whereby the participation is brought <i>to</i> an end--may authorisedly seize <a name="fr_777"></a><a href="#fn_774"><font size="1">2</font></a>; but that worthiness of theirs is owing to the duty and the praise therein--this <i>one</i> in preparing, <i>and</i> this <i>one</i> in superintendence (a<i>v</i>ar-ma<i>d</i>îh) of the recital--<i>and</i> the after discourse and petitioning, <i>and</i> other good done.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_743"></a><a href="sbe18073.htm#fr_746">201:3</a> This was the name of one of the first thirty sections of the Hûspârûm Nask (see Chap. LXI, 3), and a portion of it, containing the Pahlavi commentary (or Zand) of three chapters, with many Avesta quotations, is still extant.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_744"></a><a href="sbe18073.htm#fr_747">201:4</a> The word <i>g</i>û<i>g</i>anŏ, 'dirham,' is here omitted, but occurs in §§ 16, 20. The sum of 350 dirhams would be about 122½ rûpîs (see Chap. LII, 1 n).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_745"></a><a href="sbe18073.htm#fr_748">201:5</a> That is, those who are still learning their priestly duties (see Chap. XLV).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_746"></a><a href="sbe18073.htm#fr_749">202:1</a> It being far easier to learn the Avesta by heart than to understand its meaning by aid of the Pahlavi commentary; a competent knowledge of the latter being sought only by advanced disciples, and rarely attained by any but the most learned priests.</p>

XXXVII, 11 n, the most evil one is said to have been that in which the author lived, the millennium of Hûshê<i>d</i>ar (about A.D. 600-1600 according to the chronology of Bund. and Byt.), for 'mankind become most perplexed in that perplexing time' (see Byt, II, 62, 63), a period of great tribulation for the religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers.</p>

K35 has ângûn, 'so,' instead of <i>g</i>û<i>g</i>anŏ, 'dirham' (the two words being nearly alike in Pahl. letters); this would alter the phrase as follows:--'or less; as to 350, so paltry a thing we do not accept.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_759"></a><a href="sbe18073.htm#fr_762">205:2</a> That is, in the most solemn manner, and with all appliances. It appears from Chap. LXXXVIII, 9, that the religious rites without holy-water were then performed for 120 to 150 dirhams, or little more than one-third the fee demanded for those with holy-water; whereas the merit of some rites with holy-water is said to be a hundred times as great as that of the same rites without holy-water (see Sls. XVI, 6).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_767"></a><a href="sbe18073.htm#fr_770">207:1</a> M14 has '<i>it</i> is not eminence in wealth;' but the meaning is evidently that there is no real saving when the expenditure is reduced, because the good effect of the rites is also diminished when they are insufficiently paid for.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_768"></a><a href="sbe18073.htm#fr_771">207:2</a> Or, khânŏpânŏ may mean 'a keeper of the sacred table,' or low stone platform on which the ceremonial vessels are placed, which is often called khân. In either case the orderer of the ceremony is meant, and the author evidently contemplates the probability of the order being given as a mere formal matter of duty, without any really religious feeling.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_769"></a><a href="sbe18073.htm#fr_772">208:1</a> This parable justifies the taking of religious stipends by force, in cases of necessity, by a practical appeal to the sympathies of the enquirers; but it really evades the question proposed in § 7, which refers to seizures not justified by necessity.</p>
