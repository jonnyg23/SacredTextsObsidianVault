 <p>1. <i>As to</i> that which is written in that epistle, that in the teaching of Sôshâns he thus states, that 'of both the purifiers necessary he is suitable by whom the ritual is performed <a name="fr_1167"></a><a href="#fn_1163"><font size="1">3</font></a>,' they have been similarly very unanimous that when one is incapable (atû) <a name="fr_1168"></a><a href="#fn_1164"><font size="1">4</font></a> it is the other <i>that</i> is suitable, who is written <i>of</i> in connection with him; and that, moreover, because the statement of Afarg is in a teaching of his <a name="fr_1169"></a><a href="#fn_1165"><font size="1">5</font></a>, and, on</p>

 <p>that account, that declaration of his seemed <i>to be</i> from him, which is as though <i>it were</i> decided by him. 2. Then, when <i>one</i> reaches the eulogistic (afrâsînâkŏ) reply of his re-explainer, owing to his just will it is itself well perceived that Afarg comes into account as one of the high-priests; and that which is the special teaching of Sôshâns <i>has</i> mentioned that they have been very unanimous that when there is one he would be suitable <a name="fr_1170"></a><a href="#fn_1166"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>3. That evidence, too, which many high-priests, and especially one teaching, are alike diffusing, is stated also in the teaching of Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh, that when he who is washing <a name="fr_1171"></a><a href="#fn_1167"><font size="1">2</font></a> understands the profession, then one purifier is plenty for him. 4. When it is abundantly declared, in particular by two teachings, <i>that</i> when there is one he is suitable, <i>it</i> is then not to be rendered quite inoperative through the solitary statement of Afarg; for Afarg only said, as it appeared so to him himself, <i>that</i> 'two purifiers are requisite <a name="fr_1172"></a><a href="#fn_1168"><font size="1">3</font></a>.' 5. The customs of another high-priest are not declared to exist with like evidence; and this is set aside (spê<i>g</i>î<i>d</i>ŏ) even by him himself, that another custom is not suitable to exist, because his own view is mentioned as it appeared to him.</p>  
 <p>6. Those of the primitive faith have been fully <a name="fr_1173"></a><a href="#fn_1169"><font size="1">4</font></a> of the custom that other <i>one</i> selected, as to this, where <i>it</i> is the performance of the Vîkaya ('exorcism') <a name="fr_1174"></a><a href="#fn_1170"><font size="1">5</font></a>; because its explanation is this, that an</p>

 <p>opinion upon which the priests (magavôgânŏ) are without dispute is that which he says is the custom of a priest, <i>and</i> the business of the two priests, of whose other custom he speaks as much, is a performance by those two witnesses indicating the same as the priest.</p>  
 <p>7. This, too, is evident, that, by confession of Afarg, when there is <i>only</i> one purifier <i>he</i> is to be considered as being suitable <a name="fr_1175"></a><a href="#fn_1171"><font size="1">1</font></a>; <i>and</i> an attainment <i>to</i> more evidence is that which is written by you, that Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh <i>has</i> said that every customary <i>part</i> (pî<i>s</i>akŏ) is to be washed three times <a name="fr_1176"></a><a href="#fn_1172"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and now the purifiers <i>do it</i> once. 8. That teaching remains <i>in</i> the same manner as written by him, but the three-fold washing of Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh is not a washing to be striven for, but <i>one</i> to be well considered, <i>of</i> which he spoke; and this, too, is not said by him, that when <i>one</i> shall not wash three times it is not proper <a name="fr_1177"></a><a href="#fn_1173"><font size="1">3</font></a>. 9. Afarg said that when <i>one</i> shall <a name="fr_1178"></a><a href="#fn_1174"><font size="1">4</font></a> wash once it is proper, and about this once the opinion of Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh is the after statement, and the opinion of Afarg is the prior statement; <i>and</i> since in the life of man the first <i>thing</i> to be considered is about purity, not the indispensability of washing, and, further, the</p>

 <p>pollution diminishes, about which it speaks in the religious cleansing, during so many times washing <i>as</i> is declared, then the consideration of it is a consideration about the one time which is the first computation <a name="fr_1179"></a><a href="sbe18108.htm#fn_1175"><font size="1">1</font></a>. 10. That which mentions more than once washing is a contradiction of the prior deponent, not a declaration; <i>and</i> the consideration of that operation, so long as <i>it is</i> declared, is about the statement of him who <i>has</i> mentioned once washing with the opinion of a prior deponent <a name="fr_1180"></a><a href="sbe18108.htm#fn_1176"><font size="1">2</font></a>, owing to the same <i>reasons</i>. 11 . But if it be even that much washing which is the merit of the operation, then the statement of Afarg about these times <a name="fr_1181"></a><a href="sbe18108.htm#fn_1177"><font size="1">3</font></a> is manifestly very preservative, <i>and</i> that of Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh is a necessity for declaration.</p>
