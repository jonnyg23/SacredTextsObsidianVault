 <p>1. The twenty-third question is that which you ask thus: When he who is righteous passes away, where is the place the soul sits the first night, the second, and the third; and what does it do?</p>  
 <p>2. The reply is this, that thus it is said, that the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_54"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 54</font></a></p>  
 <p>soul of man, itself the spirit of the body <a name="fr_160"></a><a href="#fn_159"><font size="1">1</font></a>, after passing away, is three nights upon earth, doubtful about its own position (gâs) <a name="fr_161"></a><a href="#fn_160"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and in fear of the account; and it experiences terror, distress (dahyakŏ), and fear through anxiety about the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge <a name="fr_162"></a><a href="#fn_161"><font size="1">3</font></a>; and as it sits it notices about its own good works <i>and</i> sin. 3. And the soul, which in a manner <i>belongs</i> to <i>that</i> same spirit of the body which is alike experiencing and alike touching it, becomes acquainted by sight with the sin which it <i>has</i> committed, and the good works which it <i>has</i> scantily done.</p>  
 <p>4. And the first night from its own good thoughts, the second night from <i>its</i> good words, and the third night from <i>its</i> good deeds it obtains pleasure for the soul; and if also, with the righteousness, there be sin which remains <i>in it</i> as its origin, the first punishment in retribution for the evil deed occurs <i>that</i> same third night. 5. The same third night, on the fresh arrival of a dawn <a name="fr_163"></a><a href="#fn_162"><font size="1">4</font></a>, the treasurer of good works, like a handsome maiden (kanîkŏ) <a name="fr_164"></a><a href="#fn_163"><font size="1">5</font></a>, comes out to meet <i>it</i> with the store of its own good works; and, collected by witches (parîkŏ-<i>k</i>ind), the sin and crime unatoned for (atôkhtŏ) come on to the account <i>and</i> are justly accounted for <a name="fr_165"></a><a href="#fn_164"><font size="1">6</font></a>.</p>

 <p>6. For the remaining (ketrûn<i>d</i>) sin it undergoes punishment <i>at</i> the bridge, and the evil thoughts, evil words, and evil deeds are atoned for; and with the. good thoughts, good words, and good deeds of its own commendable and pleasing spirit it steps for-ward unto the supreme heaven (garô<i>d</i>mânô) <a name="fr_166"></a><a href="#fn_165"><font size="1">1</font></a>, or to heaven (vahi<i>s</i>tô), or to the ever-stationary (hamîstânagânŏ) of the righteous <a name="fr_167"></a><a href="#fn_166"><font size="1">2</font></a>, there where there is a place for it in righteousness.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_164"></a><a href="sbe18031.htm#fr_165">54:6</a> The author is more practical than most other writers on the same subject, as he assumes that the righteous soul is not absolutely righteous, nor the wicked soul absolutely wicked.</p>
