 <p>1. First you ask thus: Why is a righteous man created better than the stars and moon <i>and</i> sun and fire of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, and is called in revelation greater and better than the spiritual creation, <i>and</i> also than that which is worldly?</p>  
 <p>2. The reply is this, that the greatness and goodness of advance in wisdom and just judgment over the creatures arise from proficiency (hûnar). 3. Justice is the one good proficiency over the creatures, the means of wisdom are great, and praise bestowed is the most effectual performance</p>  
 <p><a name="page_12"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 12</font></a></p>  
 <p>of what is desirable (kâmi<i>s</i>n-karîh). 4. For all three are mutually connected together; since the manifestation of justice is through wisdom, and its advantage is the performance of what is desirable for the creator; wisdom is the performance of what is desirable for the requirements of the creator, and its weapon (zênô) is justice; and the desire of the creator, which is progress, is in wisdom with justice. 5. All three are great among the creatures, and their lodgment in the superior beings and righteous men is spiritual, in the spirit which is the pure guardian angel <a name="fr_38"></a><a href="#fn_38"><font size="1">1</font></a>, <i>in</i> the understanding for encountering, averting, smiting, and prostrating (khvâpâk) the fiend, <i>in</i> the army of angels, and in the sovereignty of the far-seeing (dûr-vênâko) <a name="fr_39"></a><a href="#fn_39"><font size="1">2</font></a> spirit, Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; and, materially, in the worldly equipment and mutual connection of body <i>and</i> life. 6. And their appliances are the wisdom and worldly efficacy of treatises on the wise adoption of good thoughts, good words, <i>and</i> good deeds, <i>and</i> the relinquishment <i>and</i> discontinuance of evil thoughts, evil words, <i>and</i> evil deeds. 7. And their acquirer is the worldly ruler who is providing for Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, and approving and stimulating the pure religion, a praiser of the good and pure creator, and a director of persistence in destruction of the fiend. 8. And in the promulgation</p>

 <p>9. And <i>such rulers</i> are great and pre-eminent; yet every man is not for that greatness, but it is mentioned as to superior beings <i>and</i> concerning righteous men, in whom it <i>has</i> arisen, and the best are the three who are the beginning, middle, <i>and</i> end of the creation. 10. One is the pure man, Gâyômar<i>d</i>, who was its first rational praiser; he in whose keeping <i>was</i> the whole creation of the sacred beings, from <i>its</i> beginning and immaturity unto the final completion of the worldly creatures, over which <i>was</i> the exercise of goodness of his well-destined progeny, such as Hôshâng, Tâkhmôrup, Yim, and Frê<i>d</i>ûn <a name="fr_41"></a><a href="#fn_41"><font size="1">2</font></a>, such as the apostles of the religion, like Zaratû<i>s</i>t, Hûshê<i>d</i>ar, and Hûshê<i>d</i>ar-mâh <a name="fr_42"></a><a href="#fn_42"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and the producers of the renovation <i>of the universe</i>, like Sôshâns <a name="fr_43"></a><a href="#fn_43"><font size="1">4</font></a>, Rôshanô-<i>k</i>ashm, and</p>

The approver <a name="fr_45"></a><a href="#fn_45"><font size="1">2</font></a> of the enterprises (rûbâk-dahi<i>s</i>nîhâ) of cŏoperators, the purely-praising and just worshipper of the sacred beings through the strength of the spirit, the disabler of the worldly activity of the fiend as regards worldly bodies, and the one of pure religion--which is his charge (spôr) <a name="fr_46"></a><a href="#fn_46"><font size="1">3</font></a>, the revelation of the place of the beneficent spirit and of the destruction of the depravity of the evil spirit <a name="fr_47"></a><a href="#fn_47"><font size="1">4</font></a>, the subjugation (khvâpi<i>s</i>nŏ) of the fiend, the completion of the triumph of the creator, and the unlimited progress of the creatures--is the upholder of Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worship. 12. And likewise through the goodness of Gâyômar<i>d</i>, which is the begetting of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, <i>he</i> is also just; likewise through the goodness of Sôshâns, by which he is the progeny of Zaratû<i>s</i>t, <i>he</i> is also progressive in every good thought, good word, <i>and</i> good deed, <i>more</i> than the creatures which are produced with a hope of the religion, and equally thankful. 13.

 <p>the renovator (frashagar) Sôshâns, who is the putter down, with complete subjugation from the world, of the glorification of fiends <i>and</i> demons, and of the contention with angels in apostasy and heterodoxy of various kinds and unatoned for; and the completer of the renovation through the full continuance of the glorification of the angels, and the perfect continuance of the pure religion.</p>

And through that excellent, unblemished, brotherly work <a name="fr_49"></a><a href="sbe18011.htm#fn_49"><font size="1">1</font></a> <i>such a ruler</i> may be seen above the sun with swift horses, the primeval luminaries, and all removal of darkness, the advance of illumination which is the display (tô<i>g</i>isnŏ) of the days <i>and</i> nights of the world <a name="fr_50"></a><a href="sbe18011.htm#fn_50"><font size="1">2</font></a>. 15. Regarding the same completion of the renovation <i>of the universe</i> it is said in the revelation of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, that this great light is the vesture of the like righteous men.</p>

The five names of these primeval sovereigns are corruptions of the Avesta names, Gaya-maretan, Haoshyangha, Takhmô-urupa, Yima, and Thraêtaona.
