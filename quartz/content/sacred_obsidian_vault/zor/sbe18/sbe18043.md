 <p>1. The thirty-fifth question is that which you ask thus: Who are they who are requisite in producing the renovation <i>of the universe</i>, who were they, <i>and</i> how are they?</p>  
 <p>2. The reply is this, that of those assignable for that most perfect work the statements recited are lengthy, for even Gâyômar<i>d</i>, Yim the splendid, Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtamân <a name="fr_254"></a><a href="#fn_253"><font size="1">2</font></a>, the <i>spiritual</i> chief (ra<i>d</i>ŏ) of the righteous, and many great thanksgivers <i>were</i> </p>

 <p><a name="page_78"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 78</font></a></p>  
 <p>appointed for completing the appliances of the renovation; and their great miracles and successful (a<i>v</i>a<i>k</i>îragânîk) management <i>have</i> moved on, which works for the production of the renovation <a name="fr_255"></a><a href="#fn_254"><font size="1">1</font></a>. 3. Likewise, on the approach of the renovation, Keresâsp <a name="fr_256"></a><a href="#fn_255"><font size="1">2</font></a> the Sâmân who smites Dahâk, Kaî-Khûsrôî <a name="fr_257"></a><a href="#fn_256"><font size="1">3</font></a> who was made to pass <i>away</i> by Vâê the long-continuing lord <a name="fr_258"></a><a href="#fn_257"><font size="1">4</font></a>, Tûs and Vêvan <a name="fr_259"></a><a href="#fn_258"><font size="1">5</font></a> the allies (a<i>v</i>âkânŏ), <i>and</i> many other mighty doers are aiding the production of the renovation.</p>  
 <p>4. But those who are the producers of the renovation more <i>renowned</i> throughout the spheres (vâspôharakânîktar) are said <i>to be</i> seven, whose names are Rôshanô-<i>k</i>ashm <a name="fr_260"></a><a href="#fn_259"><font size="1">6</font></a>, Khûr-<i>k</i>ashm, Frâda<i>d</i>-gadman,</p>

As it is said that in the fifty-seven years <a name="fr_261"></a><a href="#fn_260"><font size="1">1</font></a>, which are the period of the raising of the dead, Rôshanô-<i>k</i>ashm in Arzâh <a name="fr_262"></a><a href="#fn_261"><font size="1">2</font></a>, Khûr-<i>k</i>ashm in Savâh, Frâda<i>d</i>-gadman in Frada<i>d</i>âfsh, Vâ<i>r</i>eda<i>d</i>-gadman in Vî<i>d</i>adâfsh, Kâmak-vakhshi<i>s</i>n in Vôrûbar<i>s</i>t, and Kâmak-sû<i>d</i> in Vôrû<i>g</i>ar<i>s</i>t, while Sôshâns in the illustrious <i>and</i> pure Khvanîras is connected with them, are immortal. 6. The completely good sense, perfect hearing, and full glory of those seven producers of the renovation are so miraculous that they converse from region unto region, every one together with the six <i>others</i>, just as now men at an interview utter words of conference and co-operation with the tongue, one to the other, and can hold a conversation <a name="fr_263"></a><a href="#fn_262"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>7. The same perfect deeds for six <a name="fr_264"></a><a href="#fn_263"><font size="1">4</font></a> years in the six <i>other</i> regions, and for fifty years in the illustrious Khvanîras <a name="fr_265"></a><a href="#fn_264"><font size="1">5</font></a>, prepare immortality, and set going everlasting</p>

 <h3 align="CENTER">Footnotes</h3>
 <p><a name="fn_253"></a><a href="sbe18043.htm#fr_254">77:2</a> See Chap. II, 10. His title, which is nearly always written Spîtamân in K35 (rarely Spîtâmân), is Av. spitama or spitâma, but is usually understood to mean 'descendant of Spitama,' his ancestor in the ninth generation (see Bd. XXXII, I).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_254"></a><a href="sbe18043.htm#fr_255">78:1</a> That is, even these ancient rulers and legislators have contributed to the final renovation of the universe by their wise actions and laws.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_255"></a><a href="sbe18043.htm#fr_256">78:2</a> See Chap. XVII 6.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_256"></a><a href="sbe18043.htm#fr_257">78:3</a> Av. Kavi Husravangh, the third king of the Kayânian dynasty (see Bd. XXXI, 25, XXXIV, 7), whose mysterious disappearance, as related in the Shâhnâmah, is evidently alluded to here.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_257"></a><a href="sbe18043.htm#fr_258">78:4</a> The Av. vayãm dareghô-<i>h</i><i>v</i>adhâitîm of Khûrshêd Nyâyish, 1, that seems to be identified here with the good Vâê (see Chap. XXX, 4), who conducts the soul to the other world.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_258"></a><a href="sbe18043.htm#fr_259">78:5</a> The Tûs and Gîw of Bd. XXIX, 6 and the Shâhnâmah, where they are said to have been frozen in the mountain snow, with other warriors, after the disappearance of Kai-Khûsrôî. They are the Av. Tusa of Âbân Yt. 53, 58, and, perhaps, Gaêvani of Fravar<i>d</i>în Yt. 115, but the Pahlavi form Vêvan (or Vîvô) of our text is inconsistent with the latter identification; the form Gîw of Bd. XXIX, 6 is merely Pâzand.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_259"></a><a href="sbe18043.htm#fr_260">78:6</a> These names are the Av. Rao<i>k</i>as-<i>k</i>aêshman, Hvare-<i>k</i>aêshman, Frâda<i>d</i>-<i>h</i><i>v</i>arenô, Vareda<i>d</i>-<i>h</i><i>v</i>arenô, Vouru-nemô, Vouru-savô, and Saoshyãs of Fravar<i>d</i>în Yt. 128, 2 29, partly transcribed, partly translated, and partly corrupted into Pahlavi. The corruptions are easily explained thus: Av. vouru, 'wide,' when written in Pahlavi is often identical with varen, 'desire,' and has been so read by a later copyist and then translated by its synonym kâmak; Av. <a name="page_79"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 79</font></a> nemô is translated by Pahl. nîyâyi<i>s</i>n, 'homage, praise,' which is written very much like vakhshi<i>s</i>n, 'increase,' and has been so read by a later copyist. For the first two names and the fast see Chap. II, 10.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_260"></a><a href="sbe18043.htm#fr_261">79:1</a> The same period is mentioned in Bd. XXX, 7.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_261"></a><a href="sbe18043.htm#fr_262">79:2</a> That is, there is one of the seven producers of the renovation in each of the seven Kêshvars, or regions of the earth, of which Arzâh is the western, Savâh the eastern, Frada<i>d</i>âfsh and Vî<i>d</i>adâfsh the two southern, Vôrûbar<i>s</i>t and Vôrû<i>g</i>ar<i>s</i>t the two northern, and Khvanîras the central one (see Bd. V, 8, y, XI, 2-4)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_262"></a><a href="sbe18043.htm#fr_263">79:3</a> If this passage were found in the Christian scriptures, it would very probably be considered as a prophetical allusion to the electric telegraph and telephone.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_263"></a><a href="sbe18043.htm#fr_264">79:4</a> So in all MSS., but one would expect it to be 'seven,' so as to complete the fifty-seven years of § 5. The number being written in ciphers the difference between 'six' and 'seven' is very slight.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_264"></a><a href="sbe18043.htm#fr_265">79:5</a> This central region of the earth is that which contains Irân and all lands well known to the Irânians.</p>
