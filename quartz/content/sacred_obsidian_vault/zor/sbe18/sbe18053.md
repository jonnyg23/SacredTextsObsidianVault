 <p>7. The forty-fifth question is that which you ask thus: Is it allowable <i>that</i> those of the priesthood, when there is no daily livelihood for them from the life of the priesthood, should abandon the priesthood, and <i>that</i> other work <i>be</i> done, or not?</p>  
 <p><a name="page_154"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 154</font></a></p>  
 <p>2. The reply is this, that there is no loss of reputation to priests from priestly duties (aêrpatîh), which are themselves the acquired knowledge <i>that</i> is accumulated <i>by</i> the priestly disposition, care for the soul, <i>and</i> the requisite good works. 3. <i>And</i> there is this advantage, that, through acquaintance with the religion <i>of</i> the sacred beings, <i>and</i> certainty as to the reward of the spirit, they make <i>them</i> become more contented in adversity, more intelligent as regards stability of character in difficulty <i>and</i> restriction, and more through knowledge the abode of hope for those saved. 4.

When even by that they do not obtain <i>it, they</i> are to seek a livelihood by agriculture, sheep-rearing, penmanship, <i>or</i> other proper employment among priests; <i>and</i> when <i>it</i> is not possible for them to live even by these, <i>they are to seek it</i> by bearing arms, hunting, <i>or</i> other proper employment in the profession of a virtuous warrior. 7.
