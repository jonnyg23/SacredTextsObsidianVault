 <p>A copy of the notification (vishâ<i>d</i>akŏ') of <i>his</i> priestly lordship Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar, son of Yûdân-Yim, regarding the grievous sinfulness of <i>assuming</i> the propriety of washing for fifteen times.</p>

 <p>1. It <i>has</i> come unto the ears (va<i>s</i>ammûni<i>s</i>nŏ) of me, Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar, son of Yûdân-Yim, pontiff (ra<i>d</i>) of Pârs <i>and</i> Kirmân <a name="fr_1396"></a><a href="#fn_1391"><font size="1">1</font></a>, that, in some quarters of the country of Irân, they whose chance happens <i>to be</i> so much <a name="fr_1397"></a><a href="#fn_1392"><font size="1">2</font></a> pollution, such as is decreed unto so much washing of the customary <i>parts</i> (pî<i>s</i>akŏ), always wash <i>themselves</i> fifteen times with bull's urine and once with water, consider themselves as clean <a name="fr_1398"></a><a href="#fn_1393"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and go to water, fire, and <i>ceremonial</i> ablution, the ablution</p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_360"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 360</font></a></p>  
 <p>of the sacred twigs. 2. Such--although <a name="fr_1399"></a><a href="#fn_1394"><font size="1">1</font></a> they say that Zâ<i>d</i>-sparam <a name="fr_1400"></a><a href="#fn_1395"><font size="1">2</font></a>, son of Yûdân-Yim, <i>has</i> ordered, <i>and</i> the high-priests <i>have</i> appointed, washing of this kind--<i>has</i> appeared to my well-reflecting (hû-min) opinion, apprehension, and appreciation very marvellous <i>and</i> grave, and <i>merely</i> a rumour. 3. And <i>it</i> is needful for me to keep those of the good religion in <i>all</i> quarters of the country of Irân informed concerning the placing reliance upon their washing with the Bareshnûm <i>ceremony</i> <a name="fr_1401"></a><a href="#fn_1396"><font size="1">3</font></a>, <i>and</i> to make my own opinion clear also as regards the writings collected.</p>  
 <p>4. And, first of all, about the indispensability of the Bareshnûm <i>ceremony</i> I write several such copies of a well-matured writing of mine <a name="fr_1402"></a><a href="#fn_1397"><font size="1">4</font></a> as may even be new light to the intelligent. 5. That my opinion of the information provided by revelation, the decisions <i>of</i> high-priests, <i>and</i> the teachings <i>of</i> those of the primitive faith is thus, that washing by the polluted with water is pollution for the life and spiritual life (ahvô) <a name="fr_1403"></a><a href="#fn_1398"><font size="1">5</font></a>; they render the material <i>body</i> clean thereby, <i>but</i> that which is known as the handiwork <a name="fr_1404"></a><a href="#fn_1399"><font size="1">6</font></a> of the immortals, and is also professionally called the Bareshnûm, when <i>there is</i> the protection of a ritual of <i>various</i> kinds, shall make the body clean from endless worldly attacks.</p>  
 <p>6. It is in the nine ablution seats (magakŏ) <a name="fr_1405"></a><a href="#fn_1400"><font size="1">7</font></a> and the furrow <a name="fr_1406"></a><a href="#fn_1401"><font size="1">8</font></a>, even with prayer, bull's urine, water,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>

 <p><a name="page_361"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 361</font></a></p>  
 <p>and other appliances, and the ritual which is such as is declared in the teaching of revelation; and even now the purifiers, who are just as written <i>about</i> below, keep <i>it</i> in use. 7. When there is a washing they wash just as in the well-teaching statements which are known as <i>those</i> of Mê<i>d</i>yôk-mâh, of Afarg, and of Sôshâns <a name="fr_1407"></a><a href="#fn_1402"><font size="1">1</font></a>, or <i>in</i> the statement of one of those three teachings, or in the statement of one of the high-priests <i>by</i> whom those three teachings are declared as propriety, or has come unto me as the practice of those same three teachings <i>by</i> those of the primitive faith.</p>  
 <p>8. I deem <i>this</i> deliverance <a name="fr_1408"></a><a href="#fn_1403"><font size="1">2</font></a> one wholly approvable, and the washer <i>in</i> a washing of that kind, with the Bareshnûm <i>ceremony</i>--which is lawfully <i>of</i> that description--I consider as a purifier who is approvable. 9. And the polluted of every description, as <i>above</i> written, who <i>have</i> obtained, for any indispensable reason whatever, a purifier, as <i>above</i> written, whom even now various districts <i>and</i> various places have appointed <i>and</i> approved, are able to wash with the Bareshnûm ceremony as <i>above</i> written. 10. Then their washing fifteen times is no deliverance in any way, and to wash them quickly with the Bareshnûm <i>ceremony</i> as <i>above</i> written is indispensable.</p>  
 <p>11. Owing to a washing of the same kind through the Bareshnûm <i>ceremony</i>, as is intended, water, fire, and other <i>things</i>, not to provide care for which is un <a name="fr_1409"></a><a href="#fn_1404"><font size="1">3</font></a> . . . . . . . . . . authorisedly is grievously sinful.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> 12. When, on account of a cleansing through another washing, distinct from the Bareshnûm ceremony,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_363"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 363</font></a></p>  
 <p>they consider themselves as clean <i>it</i> is more grievously sinful; just as when they do not wash with the Bareshnûm, as <i>above</i> written, <i>but</i> consider themselves as clean through <i>washing</i> fifteen times, as <i>above</i> written, or on account of any washing whatever distinct from the Bareshnûm, <i>it</i> is more grievously sinful; because, when they do not wash with a Bareshnûm, as <i>above</i> written, <i>but</i> wash for fifteen times, as <i>above</i> written, or any washing whatever distinct from the Bareshnûm, as <i>above</i> written, they do not become clean, through the professional washing which is decreed, from that pollution which remains <a name="fr_1410"></a><a href="#fn_1405"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>13. When without similar trouble <i>and</i> great judiciousness they go unto water <i>and</i> fire, the sin is grievous; and when they go to the bowl (pa<i>d</i>mânŏ) for ablution of the sacred twigs <a name="fr_1411"></a><a href="#fn_1406"><font size="1">2</font></a> <i>it</i> is non-ablution advisedly, <i>and</i> to perform the ceremonial therewith would not be authorised. 14. And, <i>in</i> like manner, the washing of polluted Hôm <i>twigs</i> <a name="fr_1412"></a><a href="#fn_1407"><font size="1">3</font></a>, for any indispensable purpose, with the Bareshnûm <i>ceremony</i>, as <i>above</i> written, is not possible.</p>  
 <p>15. Therefore, so that we <i>may</i> obtain as <i>it were</i> a remedy for it, I wash with the Bareshnûm <i>ceremony</i>, as <i>above</i> written; to keep the mind steadfast <i>and</i> to attain to a remedy I wash with the Bareshnûm, as <i>above</i> written; <i>and</i> to bestow the indispensable, comprehensive Bareshnûm, as <i>above</i> written, is indeed a good work suitable for the discreet <i>and</i> liberated</p>

 <p>from bonds, and the purification of body <i>and</i> soul is connected with it.</p>  
 <p>16. These <i>things</i> those of the primitive faith, who provided for the moderns, <i>have</i> communicated, whose position <i>was</i> above us moderns who are now the law (gûn) of others, and are teachers and rulers; our station as regards them is the position (gâsîh) of disciples <i>to spiritual</i> masters, <i>that of</i> listeners <i>and</i> servitors to form <i>and</i> hold the opinion, about the same and other <i>things</i>, which those of the primitive faith formed; <i>and</i> the teaching of even one of those high-priests is greater <i>and</i> higher than our sayings and decisions.</p>  
 <p>17. And <i>as to</i> every custom there may be in the country of Irân, about casting away the Bareshnûm <i>ceremony</i>, as written by me, and about all the polluted, as <i>above</i> written--whom <i>it</i> is possible to wash, for any indispensable reason whatever, with the Bareshnûm as written by me, <i>and</i> one does not wash with the Bareshnûm as <i>written</i> by me, <i>but</i> is ordered to wash for fifteen times, as written by me, <i>and</i> to pronounce as clean--and <i>which</i> is established as a rule <i>one</i> is urged to practise, if Zâ<i>d</i>-sparam or any one else <i>has</i> ordered, said, or decided in the name of authority <i>that one</i> is to do <i>so, or has</i> established <i>it</i> as a rule, <i>or</i> set <i>it</i> going, this is to give authoritatively my opinion, decision, and enactment upon it likewise. 18. That <i>those</i> same sayings are short-sighted (aê-vênakŏ), <i>that</i> same order is unlawfully <i>given, that</i> same decision is false teaching, <i>that</i> same rule is vicious, <i>that</i> same setting going is grievously sinful, and <i>that</i> same authority is not to be accepted; <i>it</i> is a practice, therefore, not to be performed, <i>and</i> whoever <i>has</i> performed it, is to</p>  
 <p><a name="page_365"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 365</font></a></p>  
 <p>engage quickly <i>in</i> renunciation of it. 19. And he who <i>has</i> decreed in the country of Irân, in the name of authority, washing of <i>other</i> kinds <i>as</i> all-remedial for the polluted, as <i>above</i> written, <i>and has</i> established a rule of that description is to be considered as a heretic (aharmôkô) deserving death.</p>  
 <p>20. So, when through his wilfulness that kind of injury without enlightenment (bâm) is decreed, <i>and</i> a rule of that description is established, as <i>above</i> written, <i>and one</i> rendered polluted is washed fifteen times with bull's urine <i>and</i> once with water, or <i>in</i> whatever other mode that is distinct from the Bareshnûm <i>ceremony</i> as written by me, <i>though</i> it is possible to wash him, for any indispensable reason whatever, with the Bareshnûm as <i>above</i> written, then, his renunciation <i>of sin being</i> accomplished, <i>he</i> is to be washed again at the nine ablution seats (magh) <a name="fr_1413"></a><a href="#fn_1408"><font size="1">1</font></a> with the Bareshnûm as written by me; <i>and</i> until washed again, as written by me, <i>he</i> is not to go to water and fire <i>and</i> the bowl for ablution.</p>  
 <p>21. And this epistle is written by me, in my own <i>hand</i>-writing, for the sake of <i>all</i> members whatever of the good religion of the country of Irân becoming aware of the opinion, apprehension, <i>and</i> appreciation of the commands of religion <i>entertained by</i> me, Mânû<i>s</i><i>k</i>îhar, son of Yûdân-Yim; <i>and</i> several copies are finished <i>in</i> the month of the triumphant Ho<i>r</i>vada<i>d</i> of the year 250 of Ya<i>z</i><i>d</i>aka<i>r</i><i>d</i> <a name="fr_1414"></a><a href="#fn_1409"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>

It is not, however, <a name="page_362"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 362</font></a> quite certain that any text is really missing, as this section can be read continuously and translated as follows, without much difficulty:--'<i>Apart</i> from a washing of the same kind through the Bareshnûm <i>ceremony</i>, as is intended, <i>there</i> would be a grievous sin <i>against</i> water, fire, and other <i>things</i>, not to provide care for which would be unauthorised.'</p>  
 <p>If some folios of text are missing, as seems quite possible from the terms applied to this epistle in § 4, the question arises whether a portion of the missing text may be contained in the following fragment on the subject of the Bareshnûm, which is appended to the passage (Ep. II, vi, 2-ix, 7) interpolated in Dd. XXXVII, 33 in the MS. J:--</p>  
 <p>'As it is declared in revelation that, if a man who <i>has</i> chanted comes upon a corpse, <i>whether</i> a dog, or a fox, or a wolf, or a male, or a female, or any <i>creature</i> on whose corpse it is possible <i>that</i> he <i>may</i> come, that good man becomes so that a man <i>may</i> become defiled by him, <i>and</i> it is necessary to wash the polluted <i>one</i>, so that it <i>may</i> not make him a sinner. In order that they <i>may</i> act <i>so</i> to the polluted <i>one</i> it is necessary to wash <i>him</i>, it is necessary to perform that Bareshnûm <i>ceremony</i> of the nine nights. If the man that is spoken of <i>has</i> worked about carrying the dead and contact with dead matter (nôsâ hamâlih), so that they know about his defilement to whom he comes, then he <i>who has</i> done this work <i>in</i> contact with dead matter becomes afterwards disabled <i>for</i> that worship of the sacred beings which they perform. So, also, <i>some one</i> says (compare Vend. VIII, 271-299), where in a wilderness (vyâvân) are several priests (âsrûvô) <i>and</i> a man lies <i>on</i> the road, there he <i>who</i> carries the dead <i>body</i> of the man who passes away--as those others remain <i>and</i> stand away helpless, without offerings of <i>inward</i> prayer (vâ<i>g</i>ŏ vakhtagân) over that person (kerpô) according to the religious way--<i>having</i> washed his body, comes into the town and performs the nine nights' Bareshnûm <i>ceremony</i> twice; afterwards, his Gêtô-kharî<i>d</i> <i>ceremonies</i> (see Dd. LXXIX, 4) are performed, <i>and</i> he has acted well according to the religious way; then he comes into the ceremonial of the sacred beings. "How are those men purified, O righteous <i>one!</i> who shall stand up by a corpse <i>which is</i> very dry <i>and</i> dead a year?" (See Pahl. Vend. VIII, 107, 108.) The reply is this, that "those men are purified; <a name="page_363"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 363</font></a> for <i>it</i> is not <i>to</i> the dry from that dryness--that is, it would not act from this polluted <i>thing--that</i> the existence <i>of</i> dry diffusion <i>has</i> arisen."'</p>
