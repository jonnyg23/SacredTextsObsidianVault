 <p>1. The sixth question is that which you ask thus: Why are we men produced for the world, and what is it necessary for us to do therein?</p>  
 <p>2. The reply is this, that even in the reply to an accompanying question <a name="fr_74"></a><a href="#fn_73"><font size="1">2</font></a> <i>it</i> is written that the creatures are achieved for <a name="fr_75"></a><a href="#fn_74"><font size="1">3</font></a> justice and the performance of what is desirable for the creator; and to prepare thoroughly well that which is unlimited and the virtuous progress of the creatures, whose distress is like fear, there is the unparalleled (abrâ<i>d</i>arvatô) renovation <i>of the universe</i>.</p>  
 <p>3. And that preparation arises from the complete predominance of the creator <i>and</i> the non-predominance of the fiend, as is said of it in revelation thus: 'In that time I become completely predominant, I who am Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; in nothing whatever</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>

 <p>is the evil spirit predominant.' 4. And also about the good procedure of the creature-creation <i>it</i> is recounted thus: 'Happy <i>am</i> I when the creatures are so created by me, and according to any wish whatever of mine they give the sovereignty to me, and also come <i>to</i> the sovereignty when I have created <i>it</i> for the performance of what is desirable for the expression of what sovereignty is.'</p>  
 <p>5. And it is necessary for us to become so in the world as that the supreme sovereignty of the creator may be kept more friendly to us, its own true servants. 6. The way to that true service is known through wisdom, is believed (vâ<i>v</i>arî-aîtŏ) through truth, <i>and</i> is utilized through goodness; and the path of excellence more particularly <i>leads to</i> it. 7. And to set the good spirit rightly in the place of thought <i>it is</i> deliberately taken <i>and</i> they should deliberately leave <i>it</i> <a name="fr_76"></a><a href="#fn_75"><font size="1">1</font></a>, as it is said in revelation that Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> spoke out to Zaratû<i>s</i>t thus: 'Thou shouldst assist Vohûman with thy pure spiritual faculties (ahvŏ), so that they may make him fully welcome; for when thou assistest Vohûman with thy pure spiritual faculties, so that they make him fully welcome, thou shalt thus fully understand the two ways, <i>that</i> which is good conduct, and <i>that</i> also which is bad conduct.'</p>
