 <p>1. The fiftieth question is that which you ask thus: <i>As to one</i> of the good religion who drinks wine immoderately, and loss <i>and</i> injury happen to him owing to that immoderate drinking, what is then the decision about him? 2. And how is the measure of wine-drinking <i>which</i> when they drink is then authorised for them?</p>  
 <p>3. The reply is this, that whoever through the influence of opportunity drinks wine immoderately, <i>and</i> is adult and intelligent, through every loss <i>and</i> injury which thereupon come to him from that immoderate drinking, or <i>which</i> occasion anything unto any one, is then his causing such pollution to the creatures, in his own pleasurably <a name="fr_669"></a><a href="#fn_666"><font size="1">1</font></a> varied modes, that the shame owing to it is a help (dastakîh) out of that affliction. 4. And even <i>he</i> who gives wine authorisedly <a name="fr_670"></a><a href="#fn_667"><font size="1">2</font></a> unto any one, and he is thereby intoxicated by it, is equally guilty of every sin which that drunkard commits owing to that drunkenness.</p>  
 <p>5. And concerning that drunkenness, what is said is that that is to be eaten <i>through</i> which, when <i>one</i> eats <i>it, one</i> thinks better, speaks better, and acts</p>

 <p>better; and such even is the food <i>by</i> which, through <i>having</i> drunk wine, <i>one</i> becomes more virtuous, or does not become more vicious, in thought, word, and deed. 6. When an experiment as regards its <i>being</i> good is tried, so that <i>having</i> drunk it in that proportion <i>one</i> becomes better, or does not become worse, then it is allowable to drink <i>it</i>.</p>  
 <p>7. When an untried <i>person</i>, for the sake of <i>being</i> tried, <i>has</i> drunk a mingled portion, first of one drinking-cup <a name="fr_671"></a><a href="#fn_668"><font size="1">1</font></a>, secondly of two drinking-cups, <i>and</i> thirdly of three drinking-cups, <i>and</i> through drinking <i>it</i> he becomes more virtuous, or does not become more vicious, in thought <a name="fr_672"></a><a href="#fn_669"><font size="1">2</font></a>, word, <i>or</i> deed, <i>he</i> is to increase the drinking-cups, and the experiment is allowable unto those tested just so far as the proportion is <i>such</i> that he becomes better, or does not become worse. 8. To those tested <i>it</i> is authorisedly <i>given</i> to that amount through which the experimenting that is mentioned <i>has</i> extended; and to <i>him</i> who <i>it</i> is proved will become worse through the drinking of wine, that amount, through the drinking of which, <i>when</i> given <a name="fr_673"></a><a href="#fn_670"><font size="1">3</font></a> in the experiment, <i>it was</i> seen that he became worse, is not authorisedly given.</p>  
 <p>9. In a case of doubt <i>one</i> is to consider <i>him who is</i> orthodox (hû-dînô), who <i>has</i> chanted the <i>sacred</i> hymns, <i>and is</i> of good. repute, whose drunkenness</p>

 <p>is not manifest, in this <i>way</i>, that he drinks as much wine as <i>was</i> tried by him when he became no worse <i>by</i> drinking <i>it</i>. 10. It is necessary to consider <i>him whose</i> religion is unseen, whose religion is wrong, and him who is a child furnished even with the realities of religion, in this <i>way</i>, that he becomes worse through <i>having</i> drunk wine. 11. When <i>apart</i> from the decision there is no assignable (ban<i>g</i>i<i>s</i>nîk) reason as regards <i>it</i>, the share of wine which they gave not authorisedly who themselves drank wine, <i>one</i> considers as <i>some of</i> the wine on <i>its being</i> given more authorisedly <a name="fr_674"></a><a href="#fn_671"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_666"></a><a href="sbe18058.htm#fr_669">178:1</a> K35 has a blank space here for a word, but no word seems really necessary. M14 fills up the blank by changing gvî<i>d</i>ŏ into gar<i>d</i>îni<i>d</i>ŏ, and reads 'converted unto his own pleasure, and the mode,' &amp;c.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_667"></a><a href="sbe18058.htm#fr_670">178:2</a> M14 has 'unauthorisedly,' a very natural emendation of the text as it stands in K35, but it does not appear that the author intended to limit the responsibility of the person giving the wine merely to those cases in which his action would be quite unjustifiable.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_668"></a><a href="sbe18058.htm#fr_671">179:1</a> Reading â<i>v</i> <i>g</i>âmakŏ, 'water-cup;' but it is written like â<i>v</i> sîmakŏ in the MSS.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_669"></a><a href="sbe18058.htm#fr_672">179:2</a> K35 has mân, M14 mîni<i>s</i>nŏ.</p>

M14 substitutes ba<i>r</i>â yehevûnê<i>d</i> for bû<i>d</i>ŏ <i>g</i>ân bû<i>d</i>ŏ, which gives the following meaning: 'through the drinking of which, in the experiment, <i>it is</i> seen that he becomes thoroughly worse.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_671"></a><a href="sbe18058.htm#fr_674">180:1</a> The meaning appears to be that, when there is no special reason to the contrary, the quantity of wine one may have already drunk elsewhere is to be considered as part of one's allowance.</p>
