 <p>1. Then comes that itself <a name="fr_1082"></a><a href="#fn_1078"><font size="1">1</font></a> which is dictated <i>in</i> the middle of your epistle, <i>and</i>, thereupon, it lays hold of me, and, owing to its hellish gloom, pallid appearance, <i>and</i> hellish effect, benediction is perplexedly dispensed by me in terror for <i>my</i> heart <i>and</i> mind; I <i>have</i>, also, grievously repented, as regards my own former arrangements in my warfare of violence--which <i>were</i> undeceptive in the balance pertaining to Rashnû <a name="fr_1083"></a><a href="#fn_1079"><font size="1">2</font></a>--of any real falsity of the co-existent <i>one</i> <a name="fr_1084"></a><a href="#fn_1080"><font size="1">3</font></a> I <i>may</i> have produced.</p>  
 <p>2. <i>Responsible</i> for the malice <i>and</i> annoyance of unjust kinds which are encountering <i>us</i> is the fiend of great strength, who is unobserving, seductive, astute in evil, eager for causing annihilation (ga<i>s</i>tokûn-varen), <i>and</i> full of deceit, so that <i>it</i> is possible for him to render doubtful, <i>when</i> so deceived, even him who is most a listener to essential righteousness, most desirous of steadfast truth, most performing proper religious customs, most acquainted with good ideas, most amazingly careful of <i>his</i> soul, most approved in the most wounding hell-brought conflict, <i>and</i> most at home (khânagîktûm) in truth of all kinds, <i>and</i> to show him a semblance of reality in unreality, <i>and</i> of unreality in reality. 3. Just as even that similitude which is mentioned in revelation thus: 'He intends righteousness <i>and</i> considers</p>

 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_283"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 283</font></a></p>  
 <p>about it thus: "A good work is done by me," and he acquires fiendishness--that is, it becomes a source of sin for him--who shall bring forth water without holy-water to <i>one</i> contaminated by dead matter (nas-hômand), or who shall bring <i>it</i> forth without holy-water on a concealed <i>or</i> dark <i>place</i> in the night <a name="fr_1085"></a><a href="#fn_1081"><font size="1">1</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>4. And about this I <i>have</i> no doubt, that the wish of that spirit is not coincident with righteousness, for it is realised, understood, <i>and</i> known that, as regards his own <i>creatures, he</i> is not careful for the proper movement of body and for the long living of life; so that the furtherance <i>and</i> continuance of these, which are his original resources of body and activities (khapârânŏ) of life, become, for him who is among them (the fiend's creatures), an increase of the propitiation of the sacred beings, of the practice of religion, and of the advancement and benediction of the teachings of just high-priests <a name="fr_1086"></a><a href="#fn_1082"><font size="1">2</font></a>. 5. <i>It</i> is also manifest from the constantly-operating arrangement of manuscripts and synodical statements, about which Afarg <a name="fr_1087"></a><a href="#fn_1083"><font size="1">3</font></a> <i>wrote</i> without falsifying the religion <i>and</i> apart from controversies; because among them (the fiend's creatures) is <i>he</i> who <i>has</i> said they are like unto that which is now written</p>

 <p>by him himself about it, and it has arranged much deliverance <i>from sin</i> <a name="fr_1088"></a><a href="#fn_1084"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>6. Of this, too, I am aware, that, except there where a purifier is in no way reached, his great duty--which is just the purification <i>in</i> which there is a washer who is cleansed (masî<i>d</i>ô) in the religious mode for the profession of the priesthood--is then a means which the high-priests should allow <a name="fr_1089"></a><a href="#fn_1085"><font size="1">2</font></a>. 7. A washing which is not religiously ritualistic is ranked as an operation among the useless <i>ones; it is</i> vicious <i>and</i> grievously criminal, because the special means which, by preserving the soul <a name="fr_1090"></a><a href="#fn_1086"><font size="1">3</font></a>, is the perfect happiness of men, is the purification</p>  
 <p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_285"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 285</font></a></p>  
 <p>of men. 8. <i>It</i> is said <a name="fr_1091"></a><a href="#fn_1087"><font size="1">1</font></a>: 'The purification of men cleansingly is a something (aîtŏ) for the soul that should be after perfect birth; when they have been fully born the purification of others is the one thing which is good for the soul.'</p>  
 <p>9. And it is shown <i>in</i> another place that it is possible to obtain possession of purification also for the soul through purification of the body, even as it is said that a purifier is requested by him. to. And it is necessary for him to speak thus: 'I have thus stood close by the body of him who is dead; I am no wisher <i>for it</i> by thought, I am no wisher <i>for it</i> by word, I am no wisher <i>for it</i> by deed; which is the reason--that is, on account of pollution--it is not possible to seek good works by thought, word, <i>or</i> deed, <i>and</i> it demands purification for me, that is, wash me thoroughly <a name="fr_1092"></a><a href="#fn_1088"><font size="1">2</font></a>!' 11. As it is thereby declared that when he whose body is not purified, until they thoroughly wash him, is not able to seek good works by thought, word, <i>or</i> deed, and is not able to purify his soul, it is then a matter for the truly wise <i>to seek</i> even for purification of the soul by the purification of the body, <i>for</i> whose religious purification are those <i>things</i> which are unsubdued (a<i>s</i>ikand) in the religious ritual.</p>  
 <p>12. When these are thus the statements of former upholders of the religion <i>and</i> high-priests of the religion, he who is more intelligent <i>and</i> more active</p>

 <p>in the religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers in every house, village, tribe, and province--<i>and</i>, very much more the man who is righteous, of fluent speech, speaking the truth, who <i>has</i> chanted the <i>sacred</i> hymns, acquainted with the ritual, trained for the work, of renowned disposition, and a friend of the soul--is <i>competent</i> for the purification which <i>it</i> is very important to prepare, to think of, <i>and</i> to promote.</p>  
 <p>13. When the period is so unworthy, the fiend so abundantly contentious, and the hasty preparer of holy-water of such base origin (dû<i>s</i>-vêkh) <a name="fr_1093"></a><a href="#fn_1089"><font size="1">1</font></a>--which <i>happens</i>, moreover, when the good are equally low-minded (ham-bâstŏ-mînisnŏ)--we strive for <i>what</i> encourages the preparation of that even which is a collectively virtuous profession. 14. Then, too, <i>there</i> remains such rising in strength of many new <i>things</i> from very many countries, which is particularly grievous distress and danger to us; they deliver tokens <i>of them</i> to us applaudingly, <i>and</i> the expansibility of the words of the delivering diffuser of these and also other religious customs, as the sacred beings' own persistency and complete glory, is a great <i>and</i> powerful capability.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1085"></a><a href="sbe18103.htm#fr_1089">284:2</a> That is, whenever a properly-qualified purifier is procurable, the priests should require him to purify any one who happens to be defiled by contact with dead matter by means of the Bareshnûm ceremony (see App. IV). It appears from the sequel, and from Eps. II and III, that the heresy of Zâ<i>d</i>-sparam consisted chiefly of a misinterpretation of Vend. VIII, 278-299 (see App. V), which passage directs that a man in the fields, who has touched a corpse not yet eaten by dogs or birds, shall wash himself fifteen times with bull's urine, that he shall then run to some village, asking three different men on the way to cleanse him with the proper ceremony, and if they decline they each take upon themselves a share of the sin; when arrived at the village he shall ask a fourth time to be cleansed, and if no one will perform the ceremony he must wash himself with bull's urine and water in the ordinary manner, and shall be clean. The erroneous teaching of Zâ<i>d</i>-sparam was that the fifteen times' washing was sufficient, without the subsequent ceremonial cleansing; and the object of these epistles was to combat that view of the law.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1086"></a><a href="sbe18103.htm#fr_1090">284:3</a> The ceremonial purification is supposed to cleanse the soul, <a name="page_285"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 285</font></a> whereas ordinary washing cleanses the body only, and is spiritually useless.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1089"></a><a href="sbe18103.htm#fr_1093">286:1</a> This seems to be an allusion to the unworthiness of some of the priests of the period (compare Ep. II, i, 13; y, 14).</p>
