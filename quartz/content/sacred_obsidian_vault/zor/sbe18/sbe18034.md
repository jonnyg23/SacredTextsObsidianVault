 <p>1. The twenty-sixth question is that which you ask thus: How are the nature of hell, <i>and</i> the pain, discomfort <a name="fr_173"></a><a href="#fn_172"><font size="1">2</font></a>, punishment, and stench of hell?</p>  
 <p>2. The reply is this, that <i>it is</i> sunken, deep, and descending, most dark, most stinking, and most terrible, most <i>supplied with</i> wretched existences (anâzî<i>d</i>ântûm), and most bad, the place and cave</p>

And in it is no comfort, pleasantness, <i>or</i> joy whatever; <i>but</i> in it are all stench, filth, pain, punishment, distress, profound evil, and discomfort; and <i>there</i> is no resemblance of it whatever <i>to</i> worldly stench, filthiness, pain, and evil. 4. And since <i>there</i> is no resemblance of the mixed evil of the world to that which is its sole-indicating (aê-numâî) good, <i>there</i> is also a deviation (gumi<i>s</i>nŏ) of it from the origin and abode of evil <a name="fr_174"></a><a href="#fn_173"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>5. And so much more grievous is the evil in hell than even the most grievous evil on earth, as the greatness of the spiritual <i>existence</i> is <i>more</i> than <i>that of</i> the world; and more grievous is the terror of the punishment on the soul than that of the vileness of the demons on the body. 6. And the punishment on the soul is from those whose abode <i>it has</i> become <a name="fr_175"></a><a href="#fn_174"><font size="1">2</font></a>, from the demons and darkness--a likeness of that evil to hell--the head (kamârakŏ) of whom is Aharman the deadly.</p>  
 <p>7. And the words of the expressive utterance of the high-priests are these, that where <i>there</i> is a fear of every other thing <i>it</i> is more than the thing itself, <i>but</i> hell is a thing worse than the fear <i>of it</i>.</p>
