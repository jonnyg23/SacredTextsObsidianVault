 <p>1. <i>As to</i> the eighty-seventh question <i>and</i> reply, that which you ask is thus: <i>As</i> family householders we of the good religion of Irân, before each <i>celebration of</i> all the religious rites with holy-water <a name="fr_941"></a><a href="#fn_938"><font size="1">3</font></a> which they have provided in the land <a name="fr_942"></a><a href="#fn_939"><font size="1">4</font></a> of Pârs, have then always given for it a gift of 400 dirhams, <i>or</i> 350 dirhams <a name="fr_943"></a><a href="#fn_940"><font size="1">5</font></a> <i>at</i> least. 2. And now if <i>we</i> should be needy, when we deduct something from the 400 dirhams, or from the 350 dirhams, of the gift for them, they would then not accept <i>it</i> from us, and speak thus: 'Less than 400, or than 350, dirhams we do not <a name="fr_944"></a><a href="#fn_941"><font size="1">6</font></a> accept.' 3. <i>But</i> there are needy <i>men</i> </p>

 <p>who always come to us themselves and speak thus: 'For 350 dirhams we will always twice conduct all the religious rites <i>and</i> ceremonial with holy-water such as <i>those</i> which you have always ordered before for 400; only order us.' 4. Would a needy <i>one, apart</i> from the priestly men <i>who</i> always say that they are not, be authorised, or not?</p>  
 <p>5. The reply is this, that the priest <i>to whom your</i> predecessors <i>have</i> given a gift of 400 or 350 <i>dirhams</i>, for all the religious rites with holy-water, it is proper to consider particularly virtuous <i>and</i> faithful, when there is nothing else <i>about</i> him, on account of which he is otherwise: 6. A <i>celebration of</i> all the religious rites with holy-water, in which they shall use four pure animals <a name="fr_945"></a><a href="#fn_942"><font size="1">1</font></a>--<i>and</i> just according to the teaching of the high-priests they present <i>to</i> every single fire from one animal <i>and</i> one holy-water--and the offering of holy-water unto the fire whose holy-water <i>it is</i>, and bringing it on to another fire <i>apart</i> from that holy-water, and the <i>ceremonial</i> cleansing of the holy-water they maintain by agreement in thy name, the superiors solemnize with approval, faithfully, and attentively; <i>and</i> the remuneration of 350 dirhams would be a balancing of when they conduct the religious rite <i>at</i> the place of undertaking <i>it, and</i> when <i>it</i> is undertaken as regards a distant district <a name="fr_946"></a><a href="#fn_943"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>7. In A<i>r</i>takhshatar-gadman <a name="fr_947"></a><a href="#fn_944"><font size="1">3</font></a>, within my memory,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>

 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_252"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 252</font></a></p>  
 <p>they who would accept less than 300 dirhams <a name="fr_948"></a><a href="#fn_945"><font size="1">1</font></a> for it made a memorandum (farhâng), to keep in remembrance <i>that</i> 350 dirhams for all the religious rites performed <i>was</i> to be the rule declared by those of the religion <i>in</i> A<i>r</i>takhshatar-gadman. 8. Likewise, the glorified Atû<i>r</i>-frôbag <a name="fr_949"></a><a href="#fn_946"><font size="1">2</font></a>, <i>son</i> of Farâkhûzâ<i>d</i>, who was the pre-eminent leader of those of the good religion, decided <i>in</i> the same manner.</p>  
 <p>9. And now, too, they always conduct those <i>rites</i> which are without holy-water for 150 dirhams, <i>or</i> even for 120 dirhams <a name="fr_950"></a><a href="#fn_947"><font size="1">3</font></a>; and the reason of it is the neediness of the disciples who, owing to that need, <i>and</i> in hope of obtaining more employment, always diminish <i>their demands, and</i> through deficient remuneration always become more needy, more importunate, and more moderate in desiring remuneration; and, in the course <i>of</i> the employment of resources and requesting <i>the charge of</i> all the religious rites, the labour and endurance of discipleship are exhausted.</p>  
 <p>10. And <i>as to</i> him who undertakes to conduct all the religious rites twice for 350 dirhams, if <i>he be</i> properly working <i>and</i> thoroughly reliable <i>for</i> the 350 dirhams <i>which</i> are always given him for the ceremonial of all the religious rites--just like those who would always undertake <i>them</i> once--and all the religious rites are conducted <i>and</i> secured twice, on</p>

 <p>account of the merit due to the continuous ceremonial of the sacred beings it is more authorisedly ordered of those who solemnize all the religious rites twice <a name="fr_951"></a><a href="#fn_948"><font size="1">1</font></a>. 11. But <i>as</i> to <i>him</i> who would under-take all the religious rites twice for 350 dirhams, <i>but</i> is not able to conduct <i>them</i> unless he puts to it <i>some</i> of his own wealth, so that the progress <i>may be</i> acceptable to him as they conduct <i>them</i> through repetition, he should not undertake <i>them</i> owing to the reasons written in another chapter of ours <a name="fr_952"></a><a href="#fn_949"><font size="1">2</font></a>, since <i>it tends</i> much more to neediness.</p>  
 <p>12. And more like unto the ancient sceptics (vimânakŏ) <i>have</i> become the disciples, among whom disagreement <i>and</i> enmity are produced, as is written in the same writing (khadû-gûn nâmakŏ) <a name="fr_953"></a><a href="#fn_950"><font size="1">3</font></a>; <i>and</i>, owing to admonishing words, these <i>become</i> enviousness and maliciousness unto the disciples, <i>and</i> trouble <i>and</i> disagreement less becoming among you and more contentious about you. 13. And at the time <i>in</i> which a great stipend existed, <i>they</i> contended with him through whose greatness <i>and</i> abundance of stipend their conflict was caused, one with the other, through envy; and now, too, they <a href="errata.htm#0">always</a> squabble <i>about</i> his deficient stipend, by which they will tempt them, on account of <i>its</i> inadequacy, for the sake of a way for preserving life, as was shown by my metaphor in the other chapter <a name="fr_954"></a><a href="#fn_951"><font size="1">4</font></a>. 14. When those who, through need of <i>employment in the rites</i> of religion, or the recitations <a name="fr_955"></a><a href="#fn_952"><font size="1">5</font></a></p>

 <p>which are its wisdom, would at once produce enmity, and the friends of religion, are for each <i>of</i> two sides, <i>it</i> is important to look to the procuring of forgiveness, kind regards, and the progress of the elect (pasandakânŏ) in the duty of the faithful.</p>
