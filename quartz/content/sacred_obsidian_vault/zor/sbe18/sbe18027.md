 <p>1. The eighteenth question is that which you ask thus: When the souls of the righteous <i>and</i> the souls of the wicked go out to the spirits, will it then be possible for them to see Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> and Aharman <a name="fr_124"></a><a href="#fn_123"><font size="1">2</font></a>, or not?</p>  
 <p>2. The reply is this, that concerning Aharman it is said that his is no material existence (stîs); <i>and</i> Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, as a spirit among the spirits, is to be heard by those who are material and those also who are spiritual, <i>but his</i> form (kerpô) is not completely visible except through wisdom. 3. And a semblance of <i>his</i> power is seen, as <i>was</i> told unto Zaratû<i>s</i>t the Spîtamân when he saw the result (zah) of his handiwork, and he (Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>) spoke thus: 'Grasp the hand of a righteous man! for the kindly operation of my religion through <a name="fr_125"></a><a href="#fn_124"><font size="1">3</font></a> thee thyself is as</p>

 <p>much as he shall grasp, and thou mayst see him whose reception (mâhmânîh) of my wisdom and glory is the most.</p>  
 <p>4. And about the souls of the righteous and wicked, in the spiritual places they see the throne (gâs), which they deem a sight of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>. 5. And so also those who are domiciled with (hamnemân) Aharman, through that wisdom with reference to whose creator they shall suffer, will understand minutely as regards Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i> and the nature of Aharman (Aharmanîh). 6. And he who is of the righteous is delighted at escaping from Aharman <i>and</i> coming to the existence pertaining to Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>; and they shall offer homage to the glory <a name="fr_126"></a><a href="#fn_125"><font size="1">1</font></a> of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>. 7. And he who is wicked, through being deceived by Aharman, and turning from the direction (pe<i>l</i>ag) of Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, becomes more vexed <i>and</i> more penitent; the hope (zahî<i>s</i>nŏ) and forgiveness which he possesses, and the retribution <i>and</i> manacling which are his among the fiends <i>and</i> spirits through his own handiwork, are <i>by</i> the permission which comes from the most persistent of the persistent <a name="fr_127"></a><a href="#fn_126"><font size="1">2</font></a> at the period of the resurrection.</p>

The epithet khvâpar, here translated 'persistent,' appears to mean 'self-sustaining' in the Avesta (see Sls.
