 <p>1. The twentieth question is that which you ask thus: How are the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge, the Dâîtih peak (<i>k</i>akâ<i>d</i>), and the path of the righteous and wicked;</p>  
 <p><a name="page_48"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 48</font></a></p>  
 <p>how <i>are they</i> when <i>one</i> is righteous, and how when <i>one</i> is wicked?</p>  
 <p>2. The reply is this, that thus the high-priests <i>have</i> said, that the Dâîtih peak <a name="fr_136"></a><a href="#fn_135"><font size="1">1</font></a> is in Aîrân-vê<i>g</i> <a name="fr_137"></a><a href="#fn_136"><font size="1">2</font></a>, 2, in the middle of the world; reaching unto the vicinity of that peak is that beam-shaped (dâr-kerpô) spirit, the <i>K</i>inva<i>d</i> bridge <a name="fr_138"></a><a href="#fn_137"><font size="1">3</font></a>, which is thrown <i>across</i> from the Albûr<i>z</i> enclosure (var) back to the Dâîtih peak. 3. As <i>it were</i> that bridge is like a beam of many sides, of whose edges (pô<i>s</i>tŏ) there are <i>some</i> which are broad, and there are <i>some</i> which are thin <i>and</i> sharp; its broad sides (sûkîhâ) are so large that its width is twenty-seven reeds (nâî), and its sharp sides are so contracted (tang) that in thinness <i>it</i> is just like the edge of a razor. 4. And when the' souls of the righteous and wicked arrive it turns to that side which is <i>suitable to</i> their necessities, through the great glory of the creator and the command of him who <i>takes</i> the just account <a name="fr_139"></a><a href="#fn_138"><font size="1">4</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>5. Moreover, the bridge becomes a broad bridge for the righteous, as much as the height of nine spears (nî<i>z</i>akŏ)--and the length of those which they carry is each separately three reeds <a name="fr_140"></a><a href="#fn_139"><font size="1">5</font></a>--; and</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_49"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 49</font></a></p>  
 <p>it becomes a narrow bridge <i>for</i> the wicked, even unto a resemblance to the edge of a razor. 6. And he who is of the righteous passes over the bridge, and a worldly similitude of the pleasantness of his path upon it is when thou shalt eagerly and unweariedly walk in the golden-coloured spring, and <i>with</i> the gallant (hû-<i>k</i>îr <a name="fr_141"></a><a href="#fn_140"><font size="1">1</font></a>) body and sweet-scented blossom in the pleasant skin of that maiden <a name="fr_142"></a><a href="#fn_141"><font size="1">2</font></a> spirit, the price of goodness. 7. He who is of the wicked, as he places a footstep <i>on</i> to the bridge, on account of affliction (siparîh) and <i>its</i> sharpness, falls from the middle of the bridge, and rolls <i>over</i> head-foremost. 8. And the unpleasantness of his path to hell is in similitude such as the worldly <i>one</i> in the midst of that stinking <i>and</i> dying existence (hastân), there where numbers of the sharp-pointed darts (tê<i>z</i>ŏ mûk dû<i>g</i>ŏ) are planted <a name="fr_143"></a><a href="#fn_142"><font size="1">3</font></a> out inverted and point upwards, and they come unwillingly running; they shall not allow <i>them</i> to stay behind, <i>or</i> to make delay. 9. So much greater <i>than</i> the worldly similitude is that pleasantness and unpleasantness unto the souls, as such as is fit for the spirit is greater than <i>that</i> fit for the world.</p>

 <p>1. The twenty-first question is that which you ask thus: When he who is righteous passes away, who has performed much worship of the sacred beings, and many duties and good works, do the spirit of creation, the spirit of the <i>sacred</i> ceremony (ya<i>z</i>isnŏ) and religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, the water, earth, plants, and animals, make complaint unto Aûha<i>r</i>ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>, owing to the passing away of him who is righteous, and is it distressing to them when he goes out from the world, or how is it?</p>  
 <p>2. The reply is this, that <i>as to</i> him who is of the righteous, in <i>his</i> transit of worldly pain in passing away, and also after passing away to the passage onwards <a name="fr_144"></a><a href="#fn_143"><font size="1">1</font></a> which is his limit (stâr) still in the perplexing account, and, after the account, in his own joy, and in what <i>occurs</i> when his gossips (hamvâ<i>k</i>ân) in the world--by whom the spiritual beings are also not unrecognised; <i>nor</i> his position unknown--are in worldly demeanour downcast and grieving, <i>on all these occasions</i> <a name="fr_145"></a><a href="#fn_144"><font size="1">2</font></a> <i>his</i> thoughts, procuring forgiveness, are about the sacred beings. 3. And the spirit of creation, <i>and</i> the good spirit of the religion of the Ma<i>z</i><i>d</i>a-worshippers, which are in the worldly <i>existence</i>--of which <a name="fr_146"></a><a href="#fn_145"><font size="1">3</font></a> also, in the world, that righteous <i>one</i> is a praiser, an employer, a manager, a protection, and a forbearing friend--shall make an outcry to</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_51"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 51</font></a></p>  
 <p>the creator about him who is righteous, who is <i>away</i> from worldly protection, <i>also</i> for the granting of a promoter of forbearance, and <i>for</i> a restorer (â<i>v</i>ôr<i>d</i>âr) of what is extorted <a name="fr_147"></a><a href="#fn_146"><font size="1">1</font></a>; <i>likewise</i> a petition about the compensatory concomitants as to his new protection and disposer.</p>  
 <p>4. And the almighty creator responds, <i>and</i> allots a teacher <a name="fr_148"></a><a href="#fn_147"><font size="1">2</font></a> for smiting the fiend, for the satisfaction of the righteous, <i>and</i> for the protection of the good creatures. 5. As it is said, that in every age a high-priest of the religion and <i>his</i> managing of the creatures are made manifest, in whom, in that age, the protection of the creatures and the will of the sacred beings are progressing.</p>

XX, 13, 32, XXIX, 12, XXXII, 3). Its winter is likewise described as both long and cold (Vend. I, 8-12, Bd. XXV, 11, 16), which is the case in Âdarbî<i>g</i>ân.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_137"></a><a href="sbe18029.htm#fr_138">48:3</a> See Chap. XX, 3.</p>

As the reed appears to have been about 4 feet 8 inches (see Chap. XLIII, 5, note), the width of the bridge is supposed to be about 126 feet, and the length of a spear is taken as 14 feet.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_140"></a><a href="sbe18029.htm#fr_141">49:1</a> So in the MSS., but hû-<i>k</i>ihar, 'handsome,' is more probable.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_141"></a><a href="sbe18029.htm#fr_142">49:2</a> Reading kanîkŏ, instead of the kanâkŏ of the MSS., as there can be no allusion to the evil spirit here. The reference is to a good conscience, which is symbolised by the handsome maiden who is supposed to meet the righteous soul on its way to heaven (see Chap. XXIV, 5).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_142"></a><a href="sbe18029.htm#fr_143">49:3</a> Assuming that â<i>g</i>zast is equivalent to Pers. â<i>g</i>ast. The allusion seems to be to a form of torturing punishment (running upon ground studded with sharp points) well known to the author.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_144"></a><a href="sbe18029.htm#fr_145">50:2</a> The sentence is clear enough in Pahlavi, but too involved to be readily understood in English without these extra words.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_146"></a><a href="sbe18029.htm#fr_147">51:1</a> These latter clauses of the outcry refer to their own wants, and the necessity of providing some one to take the place of the deceased; but the final petition seems to be for the deceased himself.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_147"></a><a href="sbe18029.htm#fr_148">51:2</a> The word maybe either farhakhtâkŏ, 'preparing, educating,' or firî<i>s</i>tâkŏ, 'sending, deputing,' and must be used as a substantive.</p>
