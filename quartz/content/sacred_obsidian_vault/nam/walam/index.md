 This controversial work is purportedly a translation of a sequence of
 pictographs which give the epic of the Delawares, a tribe which lived
 in the central Eastern seaboard.
 Taken at face value, this would be one of the few actual written texts
 from Native North America, including a clear account
 of an eastward migration over the 'stone-hard water'.
 The source of the document, as well as aspects of the Delaware text,
 and some of the historical episodes
 have been called into question.
 I'm not going to rehash this discussion here, but offer some comments based
 on the content of the text.
 </p>
 <p>
 Most likely, the Walam Olum was forged in the 19th Century by someone who
 was attempting to provide a mythological underpinning for 
 the theory that Native Americans migrated from Asia
 at some point in the recent past.
 It is now believed that this migration took place between ten and
 fifteen thousand years ago.
 Instead of a <i>mass emigration</i> over a <i>frozen ocean</i>,
 it was a gradual infiltration by small groups.
 They weren't out to discover a new world, but simply
 following their food sources.
 Initially they moved over a land bridge that connected
 Asia and America (Behringia),
 which was exposed at the time by the the greatly lowered Ice Age sea levels.
 When the glaciers contracted at the end of the Ice Age, the conventional
 theory is that a 'corridor' through western Canada was created, which
 served as a migration route south into North America.
 Another theory is that people could have taken a sea route
 along the Canadian coast to bypass the ice sheets.
 In any case, the archeological record indicates that it
 took hundreds or thousands of years for people to get from
 Siberia to the shores of the Atlantic.</p>
 <p>
 Not only does seems unlikely that any record of this migration would have
 been preserved to this day (let alone in writing),
 but this account is at odds with most
 other Native American origin stories.
 The typical Native American mythology
 assumes that 'the people' have <i>always lived here</i>,
 or emerged from one or more worlds underneath the earth.
 For this reason, many traditionalist Native Americans
 regard the Asian land bridge migration theory
 in the same way that fundamentalist Christians feel about Darwinism.</p>
 <p>
 Other aspects of the narrative mark this as a contaminated text.
 The Walam Olum origin myth involves an act of creation of all things
 by a 'Manitou', who subsequently battles an evil 'Magician' who
 brings death, disease and bad weather into the world.
 A genesis at the hands of a single masculine deity, and an ensuing
 cosmic struggle between good and evil, so central to Old World mythology,
 are, simply put, foreign concepts in Native American mythology.</p>
 <p>
 For instance, in many Native American cultures,
 the world is created by an animal who
 dives to the bottom of the ocean and brings up land bit by bit, or by
 a pantheon of fathers and mothers.
 There is usually a trickster figure (in the Southwest, Coyote)
 who commits transgressive acts.
 However, the trickster is not considered 'evil' in the Judeo-Christian sense,
 but comic or stupid.
 Death, disease and so on are often brought into the world through
 an accident or misunderstanding,
 not as an intentional punishment by some entity.
 Another aspect of Native American mythology is the fluid boundary
 between the animal and human worlds, of which there is no evidence
 in the Walum Olum.
 </p>
 <p>
 There may be some actual indigenous content in this text, but in retrospect
 this is either a unique outcropping of Old World mythology in an improbable
 location, or a 19th Century forgery.
 There are some similar and better documented pictographic
 records from the Plains area, but these have nowhere near the
 epic scope of the Walum Olum.
 In any case, this remains one of the lasting mysteries
 of Native American literature.
