 <p>There are three languages at this mission, two of them related (bastante parecidos), and the third, which is of the east, totally distinct.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_62"></a><a href="mrci15.htm#fr_62">26:62</a> Santa Clara is in Costanoan territory, but it is probable that Miwok or Yokuts Indians were brought here as they were brought to San Jose and San Juan Bautista. It is in this way that the third and totally distinct language mentioned is to be explained. The missionaries at Santa Clara in 1811 were Magin Catalá and Jose Viader.</p>
