 <p>It was the Old-man-across-the-ocean. He picked up stones and struck them together. Nothing <a href="errata.htm#0">happened</a>. Then he picked up a willow root and whittled it down to the dry part. He bored holes in it and then setting <a href="errata.htm#1">another</a> stick in one of the holes, rolled it, between his hands.
