 <h1 align="CENTER">KEY TO THE SOUNDS REPRESENTED BY THE CHARACTERS USED.</h1>
 <p>a as in father.</p>
 <p>ā nearly of the same quality, but of longer duration. It is used as a matter of convenience to distinguish a few words from others nearly like them.</p>
 <p>ai as in aisle.</p>
 <p>e as in net. </p>
 <p>ē as in they but lacking the vanish.</p>
 <p>ei the sound of ē followed by a vanish.</p>
 <p>i as in pin.</p>
 <p>ī as in pique.</p>
 <p>ō as in note.</p>
 <p>o a more open sound than the last, nearly as in on.</p>
 <p>oi as in boil.</p>
 <p>ū as in rule.</p>
 <p>û nearly as in but, a little nearer to a.</p>
 <sup><p>û</p></sup> at faint sound like the last. Sometimes it is entirely wanting.
 <p>y as in yes.</p>
 <p>w as in will.</p>
 <i></i><p>w an unvoiced w which occurs frequently at the end of syllables. When it follows vowels other than ō or ū it is preceded by a glide and is accordingly written u<i>w</i>.</p>
 <p>h<i>w</i> the preceding in the initial position. It has nearly the sound of wh in who.</p>
 <p>l as in let.</p>
 <p>L an unvoiced sound made with the tip of the tongue against the teeth, the breath being allowed to escape rather freely at one side of the tongue.</p>
 <u></u><p>L nearly like the preceding, but the sides of the tongue are held more firmly against the back teeth, resulting in a harsher sound often beginning with a slight explosion. Some speakers place the tip of the tongue in the alveolar position.</p>
 <p><a name="page_95"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 95</font></a></p>
 <p>m as in English.</p>
 <p>n usually as in English, but sometimes very short.</p>
 <p>ñ as ng in sing.</p>
 <p>h as in English but somewhat stronger.</p>
 <p>x has the sound of jota in Spanish.</p>
 <p>s as in sit.</p>
 <p>z the corresponding voiced continuant; only after d and rare.</p>
 <p>c as sh in shall. It seldom occurs except after t.</p>
 <p>d is spoken with the tongue on the teeth.</p>
 <p>t an easily recognized, somewhat aspirated surd in the position of d.</p>
 <i></i><p>t an unaspirated surd which is distinguished from d with difficulty.</p>
 <p>k, ky a surd stop having the contact on the posterior third of the hard palate. Except before e, ē, i, and ī a glide is noticeable and has been written as y.</p>
 <p>g, gy the sonant of the preceding, occurs rarely.</p>
 <p>k when written before a back vowel (a, o, ō, û, ū) without a following y, stands for a surd nearly in the position of c in come, but the contact is very firm. The resulting sound is very harsh and quite unlike the English sound.</p>
 <p>q is a velar surd occurring only before back vowels.</p>
 <p>tc as ch in church.</p>
 <p>dj the corresponding voiced sound equivalent to j or soft g in English.</p>
