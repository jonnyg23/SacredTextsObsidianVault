 <p>It will be pleasant weather everywhere in the world. The clouds which used to be, will be no more. Everything will be as it should be. The good food will come again; it will grow again. By means of it the people will live happily. This sickness which the people used to have they will have no more. This that the people used to be sick with, blow out to sea with you, O, wind.</p>
