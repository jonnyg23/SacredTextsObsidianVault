 <p><i>The Northern Mewuk say</i>:</p>  
 <p>Bears are like people. They stand up, they have hands, and when the hide is off, their bodies look like the bodies of people. Bears know a great deal. They understand the Mewuk language, and their hearing is so sharp that they hear a person a long way off and know what he says.</p>  
 <p>Bears, like people, like to dance. Once an old Indian saw some bears dance in the forest. He saw <i>Oo-soo'-ma-te</i> the old she Grizzly Bear and a lot of little bears. The old she Bear leaned up against a young pine tree with her left hip and bent it down, and sang <i>moo'-oo</i>, <i>moo'-oo</i>. The little bears caught hold of the bent-over tree, hanging on with their hands over their heads, while they danced with their hind feet on the ground.</p>
