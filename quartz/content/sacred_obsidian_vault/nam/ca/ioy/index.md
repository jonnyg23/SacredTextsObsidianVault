 <p>This short little book was written by one of the pioneers of
 Yosemite National Park, Galen Clark. 
 In 1857 Clark was the first white person to view the Mariposa Grove, a stand
 of old-growth redwoods which are some of the largest living organisms
 on the planet.
 Clark was one of the first full-time white residents of Yosemite and
 is considered the first ranger of that park.
 Although obviously Clark had no training in ethnography, he lived
 for many years with the last generation of
 pre-contact Native Americans of Yosemite.
 It is apparent that the Yosemite Miwok, who had a disasterous first contact,
 were extremely reluctant to open up about the details of their mythology
 and culture, even to comparatively benign individuals such as Clark.
 However, this is one of the few first-hand accounts from this period,
 and the information in this book has been rehashed in many others,
 such as <a href="../lly/index.htm">The Lore and Lure of the Yosemite</a>.
