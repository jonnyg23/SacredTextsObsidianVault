 <h3 align="CENTER">9. THE MOLE AND THE SUN (ACHOMAWI).</h3>
 <p>Once the Sun fell down from the sky just about sunrise. Mole caught it, and held it up until people got there and helped him to shove it back. The Sun had meant to roll along on the ground instead of in the sky. It was from holding up the Sun that Mole's hands are bent so far back.</p>
