 <h3 align="CENTER">BRIDAL VEIL FALL</h3>
 <p>On the right the eye is drawn, as by a magnet, to Bridal Veil Fall, pouring over and down the mighty cliff from its elevated canyon bed six hundred and twenty feet above, to be torn and dashed into silvery spray on the rocks below. Famed in song and story the world over, this fall furnishes a scenic spectacle of such intrinsic beauty the eye never wearies of gazing upon it. The gracefully waving sheets of gauzy spray glimmering in the sunlight, the ever-changing rainbow hued clouds of mist that chase each other in such graceful abandon from bottom to top of the slender column; the ethereal and spirit-like quality of the whole inspires a feeling of admiration and awe almost amounting to reverence.</p>
