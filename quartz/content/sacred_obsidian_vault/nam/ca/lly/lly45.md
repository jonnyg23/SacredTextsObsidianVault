 <h3 align="CENTER">BEDDING</h3>
 <p>Their underbedding was usually made from the skins of the larger animals such as the deer and bear. Their coverings were robes made from the skins of the smaller fur bearing animals. These were made by cutting the fur into narrow strips, which were loosely twisted so as to bring the fur entirely around on the outside, and weaving them into a warp made from the tough bark of the milkweed. These robes were very warm and were used as clothing when traveling in cold weather.</p>
