 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><a href="index.htm"><img src="img/tease.jpg"></a><br><i>The Religion of the Luiseño Indians of Southern California</i>, by Constance Goddard DuBois, [1908], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">NAHACHISH. <a name="fr_275"></a><a href="#fn_270"><font size="1">260</font></a></h3>  
 <p>One of the Temecula people was called Nahachish. He was a chief. He used to have in his house the limb of a tree cut into a hook and fastened up to hang food on. Some people broke the hook down. He became so poor that he had nothing to eat, and did not know what to do. He sang a song. <a name="fr_276"></a><a href="#fn_271"><font size="1">261</font></a> He sang that he was going to leave that part of the country, but he did not know where to go.</p>  
 <p>He went to Picha Awanga, Pichanga, <a name="fr_277"></a><a href="#fn_272"><font size="1">262</font></a> between Temecula and Warner's Ranch, and named that place. There were a lot of people there having a fiesta, and there was plenty of food. They passed everything to him, and there was a sort of mush of a light gray color. So he said, "My stomach is picha." So they called the place by that name.</p>  
 <p>Then he went over the mountain at George Cook's to Palomar mountain. There was no one there. The houses were empty. He stood looking and peering about, and could see no one. So he called the place Chikuli. <a name="fr_278"></a><a href="#fn_273"><font size="1">263</font></a></p>  
 <p>Then he went to a place, Poyarak, <a name="fr_279"></a><a href="#fn_274"><font size="1">264</font></a> where some of his family lived. They gave him so much to eat that he got sick and called the place Sukishva, <a name="fr_280"></a><a href="#fn_275"><font size="1">265</font></a> nettle. "My stomach is nettle," burns, he said. He was so poor that he did nothing but go from place to place to get something to eat.</p>  
 <p>There is a place below here where he washed his hands, and called it Kaiyawahuna. <a name="fr_281"></a><a href="#fn_276"><font size="1">266</font></a> He did this on a flat rock where one</p>

 <p>can still see his footprints, and see where he knelt on the soft rock. There are footprints of deer there too.</p>  
 <p>He came to La Jolla and called it Huyama; <a name="fr_282"></a><a href="#fn_277"><font size="1">267</font></a> and the place next to that he called Namila. <a name="fr_283"></a><a href="#fn_278"><font size="1">268</font></a> He went in a ravine <a name="fr_284"></a><a href="#fn_279"><font size="1">269</font></a> and called it Sovoyama, <a name="fr_285"></a><a href="#fn_280"><font size="1">270</font></a> because it felt chilly.</p>  
 <p>He made a sort of whistling noise and called the next place Puma. <a name="fr_286"></a><a href="#fn_281"><font size="1">271</font></a></p>  
 <p>He saw people feasting when his stomach was empty, and called that place Yapichi, <a name="fr_287"></a><a href="#fn_282"><font size="1">272</font></a> where the government Indian schoolhouse at Yapichi now is.</p>  
 <p>When he came to where Mendelhall lives now, the people were eating. He had a good meal there and called the place Tumka. <a name="fr_288"></a><a href="#fn_283"><font size="1">273</font></a></p>  
 <p>In the cañon he drank water and called it Pala, water, and Pame, little water. <a name="fr_289"></a><a href="#fn_284"><font size="1">274</font></a></p>  
 <p>He went on and came to Rincon. It was muddy there and he called it Yohama. <a name="fr_290"></a><a href="#fn_285"><font size="1">275</font></a></p>  
 <p>He came to Bear Valley, where he fainted from hunger. He called it Nakwama. <a name="fr_291"></a><a href="#fn_286"><font size="1">276</font></a></p>  
 <p>He came to the water. He had something with him in a basket, and this he threw out, and it still grows there in the water, a sort of greens, called Mawut.</p>  
 <p>Then he went below Pala to a place where they ground pinole for him so fine that he could not handle it, and was disappointed. They mixed it with poison to kill him. It made him sick, and he traveled toward home. He died on the way, and turned into a rock which still stands near Temecula, two or three miles south.</p>  
 <p>They say that a priest once went out and baptized this rock because the people told him it was a man.</p>
