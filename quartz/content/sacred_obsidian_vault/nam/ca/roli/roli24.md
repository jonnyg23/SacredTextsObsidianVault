 <p>Coyote was going along. He was a man then, and had a bow and arrows. He came to Wahawut, the frog, who was making a large granary basket.</p>  
 <p>He went around her with his bow and arrows; and she thought, "My nephew, I believe you are thinking of killing me." She knew what he was thinking.</p>  
 <p>Coyote said, "No, I am not."</p>  
 <p>Then she said, "If you shoot me with your arrow, wherever you hit me water will run out and drown you."</p>  
 <p>"No, I don't believe it," said Coyote.</p>  
 <p>So he made ready his arrow and shot her, and ran away as fast as he could.</p>  
 <p>As soon as the arrow struck her, the water began to run out.</p>  
 <p>He came to a tree <a name="fr_300"></a><a href="#fn_294"><font size="1">284</font></a> and climbed into it; and the water reached it, and made a big lake around it. It rose and rose, and Coyote climbed up higher into the tree. He felt that he was near his death and began singing about his brother, his relatives, and friends. <a name="fr_301"></a><a href="#fn_295"><font size="1">285</font></a></p>

 <p>The birds came close about the tree, and told him that if he jumped down they would catch him on their backs and carry him safe to land. He believed them, jumped from the tree, fell into the water, and was drowned.</p>
