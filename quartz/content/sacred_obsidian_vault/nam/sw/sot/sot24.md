 <p>Stop crying! Go to sleep, my little boy Primrose.<br> That Saveyo Sendo will take you if you cry.<br> Over there he will eat you, if you do not stop crying;<br> Right now he will eat you, if you do not stop crying.<br> That Saveyo Sendo in his bag he will put you.<br> Stop crying! Go to sleep, my little boy Primrose.<br> Over there he will take you, then I will be crying!<br> Very thick now are the leaves of the cottonwood,<br> Very thick now are the leaves of the willow,<br> There he will take you in under the willow,<br> That Saveyo Sendo whose teeth we all fear.<br> Over there now, if you do not stop crying,<br> Over there now, on the crest of the mountains,<br> Those Saveyo walk and they hear every sound.<br> And there in the mountains that one he will take you<br> Where now they are taking the big boys and girls.</p>
