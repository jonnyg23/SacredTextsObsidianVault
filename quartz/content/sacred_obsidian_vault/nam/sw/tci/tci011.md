 <h3 align="CENTER">HELUTA AND NYENYEGA CONTEST FOR A WIFE <a name="fr_18"></a><a href="#fn_18"><font size="1">5</font></a></h3>
 <p>Heluta, <a name="fr_19"></a><a href="#fn_19"><font size="1">12</font></a> the father of the katcinas, and N<sup>y</sup>en<sup>y</sup>ega, <a name="fr_20"></a><a href="#fn_20"><font size="1">13</font></a> contested as to which should marry Yellow Woman. <a name="fr_21"></a><a href="#fn_21"><font size="1">14</font></a> Yellow Woman "ground" at the dance (i. e., she rubbed the notched stick with the deer's scapula, resting it on an inverted dried pumpkin). Heluta and N<sup>y</sup>en<sup>y</sup>ega watched her all the, time, and they thought she was very beautiful. They fell to fighting for her. They fought and fought. The koshare said, "What is the use of fighting for Yellow Woman? Go out hunting, both of you, and whoever kills a deer without wounding it shall marry her." Next day Heluta and N<sup>y</sup>en<sup>y</sup>ega went out to hunt. Yellow Woman said, "Whoever kills a deer with out a wound and brings it to me first, I shall marry him." Heluta did not find a deer, but Nyenyega killed his and brought it in unskinned without a wound. So N<sup>y</sup>en<sup>y</sup>ega married Yellow Woman.</p>
