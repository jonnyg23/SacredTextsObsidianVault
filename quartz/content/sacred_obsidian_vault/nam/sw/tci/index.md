 <p>This is a collection of texts from the Cochiti, a Native American Pueblo
 tribe of New Mexico.
 Ruth Benedict gathered these texts in the early 1920s
 in the field with her mentor at Columbia University, Franz Boas.
 The texts range from mythological to autobiographical, and give us
 an unparalleled look at the inner life of a Native American group.</p>
 <p>
 In her selection and commentary Benedict focuses on some interesting points.
 In Pueblo culture, women are considered the equal of men, and these
 tales show women exercising choice in their lives,
 engaging in specialized occupations, and taking action when wronged.
 This is reflected in Cochiti theology, which includes a cosmogenic mother
 (the moon, here called 'Our Mother') and father (the Sun).
 The texts also show the Pueblo as having positive
 attitudes about sexuality, (albeit also placing high value on
 marriage and family).
 Benedict, refreshingly, did not censor or translate into Latin
 the portions which previous scholars
 would have considered too explicit.
 The texts also show the darker side of traditional Southwestern life,
 where suspicion of malign witchcraft could lead to dire consequences;
 and the incessant low-level conflict with adjacent tribes,
 in this case, the Navajo.</p>
 <p>
 Benedict was one of the first modern ethnographers. 
 This collection is a classic, and an enjoyable read as well.
