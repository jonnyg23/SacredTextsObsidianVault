 <h3 align="CENTER">WHY THE NAVAHO BUY SO MUCH TURQUOISE <a name="fr_210"></a><a href="#fn_209"><font size="1">6</font></a></h3>
 <p>There is a sacred place in the Navaho country where they go to make offerings to obtain domestic animals. If they have clean hearts and are thinking good thoughts toward all their people, a white horse will appear to them. So they get horses and sheep. They use some of the turquoise for themselves, but the most of it they use for these offerings.</p>
