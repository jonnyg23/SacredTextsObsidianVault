 <p><a name="page_129_note_*"></a><a href="#page_129_fr_*">*</a> The Ethkay-nah-ashi, literally “The two who go about together,” are mentioned in the Creation story, <a href="ncm4.htm#page_41">p. 41</a>. The offerings are meant to be given to “The young man who walks in the darkness” and “The young woman of the dusk.” This is the very first song of the Creation story as given by the singer Klah. Five songs with the same melody and text follow except that the refrain—May it be made as offering to him—is changed to:<br>
  They have started off with it (the offering).<br>
  They have taken (the offerings) away (for the dead).<br>
  They have set (the offerings) down (for the dead).<br>
  He picks (the offerings) up.<br>
  He is pleased (with the offering). </p><p> Sandpainting No. 4, Series I, shows the Ethkay-nah-ashi.</p>

 <p><a name="page_131_note_*"></a><a href="#page_131_fr_*">*</a> The Flood is expressed in Navajo by the phrase, “we are running from the waters.” The Navajo words in the last two lines are esoteric expressions which are used only in songs and prarers. Their meaning is sacred and medicine-men disagree on their exact interpretation. The second word contains the Navajo word for “holy.”</p>

Two songs with the same melody and text follow. The first changes the refrain—<i>Smoke was spreading</i> (<i>over the earth</i>)—to: <i>Smoke streamed out</i> (<i>from behind them</i>). The second changes the refrain to: <i>He</i> (<i>First Man</i>) <i>commanded them, they heard them</i>, except the last line of each stanza where it has instead: <i>He on the chief mountain commanded them, they heard him</i>.</p>
