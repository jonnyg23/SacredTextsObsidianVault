 <p>Among the clan legends of the Northwest Indians at Alert Bay, one of the most important is that of <b>Sisuith</b> or <b>Se-Sook</b>.</p>  
 <p><b>Sisuith</b> was a fabulous double-headed, horned, <b>Oluk</b> (Snake) with his heads one at each end. In the middle there was a human head with two protruding horns. This <b>Ta-mah-no-us oluk</b> (mystic snake) had the power to assume the shape of a fish and it was said that when he swam in the rivers he was measuring the life of the people.</p>  
 <p>The penalty of seeing, touching or eating <b>Sisuith</b> was a horrifying death. The joints of the victim were dislocated and the body bent backwards until the head touched the heels. Wherever Sisuith's <b>pil-pil</b> (blood) touched the skin of a human being, it turned to stone.</p>  
 <p>The ancestors of the Indians possessed <a href="errata.htm#16">supernatural</a> <b>Skookum</b> (power) and were favored by <a href="errata.htm#17"><b>Sisuith</b></a>. If they possessed a belt made of his cast-off skin they were capable of performing magical feats such as turning <b>Sisuith</b> into a canoe which could move very rapidly through the water with the aid of its powerful fins. The eyes could be used as slinging stones with disastrous effect against their enemies.</p>  
 <p>The Houses of these mythical people had <b>Sisuith</b> carved on their cross-beams and when visitors entered the tongues of the serpent would constantly wag.</p>  
 <p>These symbols are used by clan members today in the ornamenting of their houses and articles of daily use. They are also carved on their Totem Poles.</p>
