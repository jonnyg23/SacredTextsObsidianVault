 <p>This is a collection of texts from the Tsimshian, who lived (and continue
 to reside) on the northwestern coast of British Columbia.
 An earlier (1902) collection of <a href="../nass/index.htm">Tsimshian Texts</a>
 by Boas, is also available at sacred-texts.

 </p>
 The first three are tales of culture heroes and heroines,
 far longer than most texts of this kind.
 These first three stories, with legendary quests, mysterious
 supernatural beings and atmospheric descriptions,
 remind one of Icelandic sagas.
 Following these are a couple of short and fairly unremarkable
 animal rivalry stories.
 The last item is a notable deluge myth which appears to have very little
 if any European influence.
 <p>
 Boas' Tsimshian translations have been criticized recently, as has
 his relationship with his informants as employer.
 There is no reason to believe, however, that these texts are not authentic.
 Boas was a primary figure in the dawn of modern anthropology,
 and the operating procedures and theory of ethnography were
 still being worked out at the time.
