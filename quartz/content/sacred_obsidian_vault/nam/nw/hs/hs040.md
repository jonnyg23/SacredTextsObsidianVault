 <p><a name="fn_45"></a><a href="hs040.htm#fr_50">29:2</a> Some one uses the low-class word for "sitting down" to the child, and is told to stop or the wealthy will give away so many blankets as to put him to shame and "give him a bad name." That is what is meant by "your mouth will become crooked." Common people are called "mosquito people."</p>
