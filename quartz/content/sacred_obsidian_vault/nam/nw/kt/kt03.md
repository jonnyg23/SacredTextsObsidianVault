 <h1 align="CENTER">2. SE'n<strike>l</strike>ê?.</h1>
 <p align="CENTER">Tradition of the Lê'<u>g</u>wi<strike>l</strike>da?x<sup>u</sup>.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">(<i>Dictated by MalE'd</i>, 1893.)</p>
 <p>A man lived at Yê'kwin. He said that he had come down from above, being the son of the Sun. He had the name SE'n<strike>l</strike>ê?. Then he wore the sun mask. He came after he had left the place from which he came down, where he had first been. He searched for a house site, looking for a good country. Then he found Bar-at-Mouth-of-River. There he built a house on the meadow back of the point of Bar-at-Mouth-of-River. Then he took off his sun mask and he became an ordinary man there.</p>
 <p>Then he paddled and went to Bella Bella. There he met Brave, the Bella Bella. Then he was asked by Brave, ["Go on!] (and tell me) how long you have been</p>

 <p>in the world since the time when you became a man!" Then SE'n<strike>l</strike>ê? said, "At the same time when the mountains were first put down."</p>
 <p>Then SE'n<strike>l</strike>ê? also asked Brave, "When was the time when you became a man?"--"Behold! I have been a man for a long time," said Brave, "I (became a man) at the same time when the kelp was first put down on the water." That is all they said when they parted.</p>
 <p>SE'n<strike>l</strike>ê? went home, and Brave went home to where he had come from. SE'n<strike>l</strike>ê? just went to see the whole world. That is the end.</p>
