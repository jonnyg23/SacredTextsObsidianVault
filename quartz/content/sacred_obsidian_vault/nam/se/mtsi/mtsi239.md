 <h3 align="CENTER">39. THE OWL AND THE TURKEY</h3>
 <p>An Owl was once traveling along and met a Turkey. They talked together and the Owl said, "I have a good song." The Turkey answered, "Suppose we swap our songs." "All right," said the Owl, and flying away he perched upon a limb and hooted (said "owa"). When the Owl got back the Turkey said, "Yours is a good one." Then the Turkey ran to a distance, stopped, and turned back many times gobbling. While he was doing so the Owl ran away with his song and hid it. The Turkey ran away with his song and disappeared. Then the Turkey was very happy. And the gobble which was formerly his the Owl got.</p>
 <p>Then the Owl did not want it. "I don't like it," he said. Wanting him to take it back, he ran with it into a big thicket in pursuit of him.</p>
