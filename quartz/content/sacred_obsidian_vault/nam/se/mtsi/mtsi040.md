 <h3 align="CENTER">38. WHY THE OPOSSUM HAS NO HAIR ON HIS TAIL (49)</h3>
 <h3 align="CENTER">(SECOND STORY)</h3>
 <p align="CENTER">(Tuggle collection)</p>
 <p>The Raccoon met the Opossum, and the Opossum said: "How did you make such pretty rings on your tail?"</p>
 <p>The Raccoon replied: "I wrapped bark around my tail and stuck it into the fire."</p>
 <p>Then the Opossum got some bark, wrapped it around his tail, which then had hair on it, and built a fire. He stuck his tail into the fire and burned all of the hair off and ever since then opossums have had no hair on their tails.</p>
