 <h3 align="CENTER">25. THE FOX AND THE CRAWFISH</h3>
 <h3 align="CENTER">(EUROPEAN)</h3>
 <p>The Fox wanted to catch the Crawfish in order to eat him, and the Crawfish said, "We will run a race, and if you can beat me you can have me." They agreed upon a course over seven hills, and squatted down at one end ready to start. One of them was to say "Let us go." Then the Fox had his tail stretched out close by the Crawfish and the latter seized it, so when they started he clung on and the Fox carried him from one end of the course to the other. At the other end of the course the Fox turned about quickly and the Crawfish was switched off in such a way that he fell some distance farther on. He said, "I told you that you couldn't outrun me."</p>
