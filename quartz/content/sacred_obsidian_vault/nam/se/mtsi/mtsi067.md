 <h3 align="CENTER">65. THE TASKS OF RABBIT (54)</h3>
 <h3 align="CENTER">(SECOND VERSION)</h3>
 <p>Rabbit came to Christ and asked him for more knowledge. He was given a sack and told to get a lot of Blackbirds which were making a noise some distance away. <a name="fr_11"></a><a href="#fn_11"><font size="1">1</font></a> So Rabbit went to the Blackbirds and said, "People say there are just a few of you. You could not fill up this sack, could you?" And so, to prove that they were very numerous they flew into the sack until it was filled, and he carried them to Christ.</p>
 <p>Then Christ said to him, "If you bring the Rattlesnake I will give you more knowledge." Then Rabbit went home, saying to himself, "That Snake is a pretty bad creature." But after thinking over the matter for a while he got a dogwood arrow and made it</p>

 <p>very sharp. He went out with this very early in the morning and climbed to the top of a big rock. Presently he saw the Rattlesnake and called to him, "My friend, are you asleep?" There was no reply and he called out again, "My friend, are you asleep?" He repeated these words several times, and presently the Rattlesnake said, "Yes, I was asleep. I was out hunting all night and lost a lot of sleep, so I was making up for it." Rabbit replied, "I have seen Christ and he says you are not as long as this arrow, but I think you are longer. Let me measure you and see if I am not right." The Rattlesnake answered, "I am pretty sure I am longer than that little arrow, but it looks sharp as if it would not be good." "Well, lie perfectly still and I will take pains not to hurt you. Now, shut your eyes and keep them shut." So Rabbit began measuring him, but when he got as far as his head he ran the arrow through it and pinned him to the ground. Then he ran off, coming back as soon as the Snake stopped making a noise with his rattles. He picked up his arrow and the snake and took the latter to Christ, who said, "If I were to impart to you any more knowledge, you would set the world afire." He then seized him by the tail and threw him into a brier thicket, saying: "That shall be your home."</p>
