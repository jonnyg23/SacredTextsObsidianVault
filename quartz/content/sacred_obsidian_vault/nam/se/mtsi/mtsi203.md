 <h3 align="CENTER">3. THE STARS-IN-A-ROW</h3>
 <p>Three persons went out to cut down a bee tree. One carried an ax, one a deerskin on his back, and one a spoon. While they were on the way they got lost and never came back. They are the Stars-in-a-row. (These stars are said to be in the north.)</p>
