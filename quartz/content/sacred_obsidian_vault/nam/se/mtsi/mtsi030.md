 <h3 align="CENTER">28. THE KING OF THE TIE-SNAKES (41)</h3>
 <p align="CENTER">(Tuggle collection)</p>
 <p>A chief sent his son on a message to another chief, and delivered to him a vessel as the emblem of his authority.</p>
 <p>The son stopped to play with some boys who were throwing stones into the water. The chief's son threw his vessel upon the water</p>
 <p><a name="page_35"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 35</font></a></p>
 <p>and it sank. He was frightened. He was afraid to go to the neighboring chief without the vessel, and he did not like to return home and tell his father of the loss. He jumped into the stream and, reaching the spot where the vessel had sunk, he dived into the water. His playmates waited a long time for him, but he did not reappear. They returned and reported his death.</p>
 <p>When the chief's son was beneath the surface of the stream the Tie-snakes seized him and bore him to a cave and said to him: "Ascend yonder platform." He looked and saw seated on the platform the king of the Tie-snakes. The platform was a mass of living Tie-snakes. He approached the platform and lifted his foot to ascend, but the platform ascended as he lifted his foot. Again he tried, with the same result. The third time he tried in vain. The Tie-snakes said, "Ascend."</p>
 <p>He lifted his foot the fourth time and succeeded in ascending the platform and the king invited him to sit by his side. Then the king said to him:</p>
 <p>"See yonder feather; it is yours," pointing to a plume in the corner of the cave. He approached the plume and extended his hand to seize it, but it eluded his grasp. Three times he made the attempt and three times it escaped him. On the fourth attempt he obtained it.</p>
 <p>"Yonder tomahawk is yours," said the Tie-snakes' king.</p>
 <p>He went to the place where the tomahawk was sticking and reached out his hand to take it, but in vain. It rose of itself every time he raised his hand. He tried four times and on the fourth trial it remained still and he succeeded in taking it.</p>
 <p>The king said: "You can return to your father after three days. When he asks where you have been, reply: 'I know what I know,' but on no account tell him what you do know. When he needs my aid walk toward the east and bow three times to the rising sun and I will be there to help him."</p>
 <p>After three days the Tie-snake carried him to the spot where he had dived into the stream, lifted him to the surface of the water, and placed his lost vessel in his hand. He swam to the bank and returned to his father, who was mourning him as dead. His father rejoiced over his son's wonderful restoration.</p>
 <p>He informed his father of the Tie-snake king and his message of proffered aid. Not long afterwards his father was attacked by his enemies. He said to his son: "You understand what the king of the Tie-snakes said. Go and seek his aid."</p>
 <p>The son put the plume on his head, took the tomahawk, went toward the east, and bowed three times to the rising sun.</p>
 <p>The king of the Tie-snakes stood before him.</p>
 <p>"What do you wish?" he said.</p>
 <p>"My father needs your aid."</p>
 <p><a name="page_36"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 36</font></a></p>
 <p>"Go and tell him not to fear. They will attack him, but they shall not harm him or his people. In the morning all will be well."</p>
 <p>The son returned to his father and delivered the message of the king of the Tie-snakes.</p>
 <p>The enemy came and attacked his town, but no one was harmed. Night came. In the morning they beheld their enemies each held fast in the folds of a tie-snake, and so all were captured and the chief made peace with his foes.</p>
