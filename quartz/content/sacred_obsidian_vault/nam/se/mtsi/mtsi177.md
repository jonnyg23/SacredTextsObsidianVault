 <h3 align="CENTER">41. THE BLACK SNAKE (34)</h3>
 <p>Along black snake lived in a cave in the rocks. Whenever it scented a man it trailed him and kept on until it had killed him.</p>
 <p>It killed by wrapping itself around the man's body. One day when the sun was shining a man saw it lying on the ground, and the snake pursued him. The man ran on and came to a river, and there a big yellow frog bit the snake and killed it.</p>
