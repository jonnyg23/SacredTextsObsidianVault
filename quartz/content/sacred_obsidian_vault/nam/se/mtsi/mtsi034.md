 <h3 align="CENTER">32. THE BIG ROCK MAN</h3>
 <p align="CENTER">(Tuggle collection)</p>
 <p>The people were engaged in a war. Whenever they were on the point of winning the victory the Big Rock Man came to the rescue of their enemies and saved them from defeat.</p>
 <p>They called a council to devise measures to conquer the Big Rock Man, but in vain. They could not hurt him. Their arrows bounded from his body.</p>
 <p>Then they consulted the Wise Rabbit.</p>
 <p>"Shoot him in the ear," said the Wise Rabbit.</p>
 <p>In the next fight they aimed their arrows at his ear and one struck him in the ear and killed him.</p>
