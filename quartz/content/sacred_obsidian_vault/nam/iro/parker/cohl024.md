 <p>"'Now another message.</p>
 <p>"'This concerns a certain thing that human creatures follow. It is concerning gakno`we'haat. Some men desire constant new experience, that is some men are always following ye:'o<sup>n</sup>?. Now it is a great evil for men to have such desires. This is a thing that the so sinful must confess. A man who desires to know gagwe:go<sup>n</sup> ye:'o<sup>n</sup>?sho' will never be satisfied, for ye:'o<sup>n</sup>?, will arise whom he can not know and he will fall flat. Now we, the messengers, say that all this is sinful and men must not follow such desires.'"</p>
 <p>So they said and he said. Eniaiehuk.</p>
