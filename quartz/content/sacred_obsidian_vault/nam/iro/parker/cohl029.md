 <p>"'Now another message.</p>
 <p>"'Tell your people that ofttimes when a woman hears that a child is born and goes to see it, she returns and says in many houses where she stops that its mother's husband is not its father. Now we say that it is exceedingly wrong to speak such evil of children. The Creator formed the children as they are; therefore, let the people stop their evil sayings.'"</p>
 <p>So they said and he said. Eniaiehuk.</p>
