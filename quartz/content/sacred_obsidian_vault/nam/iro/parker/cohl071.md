 <p>"'It is a custom for thanksgiving to be made over the hills of planted corn. <a name="fr_66"></a><a href="#fn_66"><font size="1">1</font></a> Let the head one of the family make an invocation over the planted hills that the corn may continue to support life. Now this will be a right thing and whosoever asks the help of the Creator will receive it.'"</p>
 <p>So they said and he said. Eniaiehuk.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_66"></a><a href="cohl071.htm#fr_66">54:1</a> The ceremony of invoking the Creator over the hills of corn was an old one and like many other old customs was indorsed by the prophet. This custom is still continued among some of the Iroquois. "When the leaf of the dogwood is the size of a squirrel's ear, the planting season has come. Before the dawn of the first day of the planting a virgin girl is sent to the fields where she scatters a few grains of corn to the earth as she invokes the assistance of the spirit of the corn for the harvest."</p>
