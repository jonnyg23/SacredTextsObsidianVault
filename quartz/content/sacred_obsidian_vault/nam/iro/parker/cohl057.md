 <h3 align="CENTER">SECTION 46</h3>
 <p>"At the time of this prophecy I was in the Cold Spring village. It occurred at this time. The prophecy was then new.</p>
 <p>"At that time a woman and her daughter administered a witch-powder <a name="fr_48"></a><a href="#fn_48"><font size="1">1</font></a> to a man and he lost his mind. He wandered off alone and died and thus a great crime was committed.</p>
 <p>"Now at that time it was said among the head men, 'We will punish the women.' So it was the plan that each chief give the women one lash.</p>
 <p>"Now I, Ganiodai'io` heard the resolution of the chiefs and was of the opinion that the women would easily survive such punishment, so, also, the chiefs believed it.</p>
 <p>"Now all this happened when the head men sat in council, the four messengers being present.</p>
 <p>"Now this thing must never happen again. Such councils never accomplish good. It is natural that foolish women should have done what these did.</p>
 <p>"Now at the time of the lashing it was in my mind that they would surely live.</p>
 <p>"So this must never happen again because the Creator has not privileged men to punish each other." Eniaiehuk. [See plate 12.]</p>
