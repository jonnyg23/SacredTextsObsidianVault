 <h3 align="CENTER">NE GANEOWO <a name="fr_100"></a><a href="#fn_100"><font size="1">1</font></a></h3>
 <p align="CENTER">One of the four sacred ceremonies of the Seneca</p>
 <p>The Ga:ne:'o<sup>n</sup>wo<sup>n</sup> is a ceremonial thanksgiving in which two preachers," standing on either side of a long bench around which a company of religious dancers have arranged themselves, alternately intone sections of the Ga:ne:'o<sup>n</sup>wo<sup>n</sup> ritual. At the end of</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_95"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 95</font></a></p>
 <p>each section the speaker starts a chant which is taken up by the singers who sit on the benches. A drummer keeps time by beating a water drum and the dancers gracefully circle around the benches. The direction of this dance, as all Iroquois dances, is counterclockwise. When the chant and dance have continued a period deemed sufficient by the opposite speaker, he halts the singing and dancing by the exclamation "Gwi?'yâ?!" and then commences his intonation.</p>
 <p>The writer had recorded the entire Ga:ne:'o<sup>n</sup>wo<sup>n</sup> ritual, speeches and songs, on a set of phonograph records, especially for preservation by the New York State Education Department. Unfortunately these perished in the Capitol fire of March 29, 1911. About 100 other ceremonial records on wax cylinders were also destroyed at that time.</p>
