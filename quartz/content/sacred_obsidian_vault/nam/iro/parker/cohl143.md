 <p>A preliminary translation of the ceremonial prayer at the burning of the white dog at the Seneca Indian new year's ceremony (February).</p>

 <p>Gwa! Gwa! Gwa!<br>
 So now this is the appointed time! Oh listen, you who dwell in the sky!</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>Our words are straight--<br>
 Only these can we speak unto you,<br>
 Oh you from whom we are descended,<br>
 Oh you who dwell in the sky!<br>
 You look down upon us and know that we are all children.<br>
 Now we petition you as we burn this sacred tobacco!<br>
 Now we commence our invocation,<br>
 Now we speak of all that you have created.<br>
 Now [in the beginning] you did think that men-beings should inherit the blessings of your creations,<br>
 For you did say, "Earth was my birthplace!<br>
 Now we have spoken in this incense [throws tobacco upon the flames].<br>
 Oh now inhale the smoke, so listen to our words.<br>
 Now we commence, we are all that remain upon the earth.<br>
 You behold the places that once were filled but now are empty;<br>
 We were unable to change it for you made the law.<br>
 Now you think that there should be two conditions of temperature upon the earth;<br>
 One you thought should be cold and one should be warm<br>
 And when the warm season came that Diohe`'ko, our substance, should spring from the bosom of Earth, our mother.<br>
 Now we have harvested the Diohe`'ko from whence our living is<br>
 For the warm season has gone and we have here assembled.<br>
 Now we have made inquiries among all the people and they remember their promises,<br>
 For they promised you that they should assemble again at Gaiwanos'kwa gowa'<br>
 On the fifth sun of the moon Nîskowûk'nî.<br>
 So all fulfilled the plan and gathered together in the moon Nîs'a, even those here present,<br>
 Oh you who were born of Earth, yet dwell in the sky!<br>
 Now all have fulfilled the law, for you did plan that the rites should be perpetuated even forever.<br>
 Now we are commencing, Oh you who were born of Earth!<br>
 Upon the first day the Great Feather dance went through the village for your pleasure.<br>
 The honon'diont and their cousins did their full duty.<br>
 Now on the next day Gane:o` was celebrated; at midday they went through the village,</p>
 <p><a name="page_87"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 87</font></a></p>
 <p>And you did give us great joy because we performed this ceremony.<br>
 For you did think that Gane:o' should be celebrated upon the earth for thine own self.<br>
 Thus did we fulfil your desires, Oh you who were born of Earth, yet live in the sky!<br>
 Now on the next day Gagandot was played.<br>
 Truly we did fulfil your desires,<br>
 Oh you who were born of Earth, you who live in the sky!<br>
 You did see all that was done,<br>
 Oh you who were born of Earth, you who live in the sky!<br>
 In the beginning you thought that you would lay this sacred tobacco by man's side<br>
 That men should have an incense with which to send his words up to the sky,<br>
 With which to lift his words when the year ended.<br>
 Truly we have fulfilled your desires and here we have that basket of sacred tobacco,<br>
 Oh you who were born of Earth, you who dwell in the sky!<br>
 [Throws tobacco on the flames.]<br>
 So now the smoke arises!<br>
 Oh inhale the incense as you listen!<br>
 For now do we commence to speak of what you have created.<br>
 In the beginning you thought that there should be a world<br>
 Upon which men beings should travel<br>
 That you might say, "They are my descendants."<br>
 Now there is a shaft that reaches up to you, Ganeowi, the sacred song of the morning it is.<br>
 Now of your descendants as many as remain are gathered here.<br>
 Now you thought that there should be two sexes of men-beings,<br>
 That one should be the male and one should be the female,<br>
 And the function of the female should be the rearing of children.<br>
 Truly the females are fulfilling the design of their creation<br>
 For in their arms we see their children.<br>
 Truly it is in progress what you planned for them.<br>
 Now the smoke arises!<br>
 So now inhale this sacred incense!<br>
 Now we petition you that this thing should continue so henceforth,<br>
 And shall continue as long as the earth endures.<br>
 Now you thought that there should be a world<br>
 Upon which grasses of different kinds should grow</p>
 <p><a name="page_88"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 88</font></a></p>
 <p>And that some should be medicinal,<br>
 And that some should yield fruits for a help to the men-beings who dwell upon the earth.<br>
 Thus did you think, O you who dwell in the sky!<br>
 Now it was ordered to be so when the warm season warmed the earth<br>
 And that it should be fulfilled them and that your descendants should see the return of things.<br>
 Now again the smoke arises<br>
 And the people speak through it to you,<br>
 Oh you who dwell in the sky!<br>
 Now we implore you that it may so occur again when the earth warms,<br>
 That your desires may be fulfilled and that your descendants may again see your creations.<br>
 Now again the smoke arises<br>
 And the people speak through it to you,<br>
 Oh you who dwell in the sky<br>
 Yet were born of Earth!</p>
 <p>Now our sustenance you thought should be placed beside us,<br>
 And that men-beings should labor for their living.<br>
 These plans are all in progress<br>
 All see from whence their living comes.<br>
 Now we implore you that when the earth warms again that sustaining food may grow.<br>
 This we ask by the power of the incense tobacco,<br>
 Oh inhale it and listen to us,<br>
 Oh you, our great ancestor,<br>
 You who dwell in the sky!</p>
 <p>You thought that there should be veins and that there should be fountains of water;<br>
 Now this thought is made a fact and is occurring<br>
 So we ask that this shall continue.<br>
 Now again the smoke arises<br>
 To you the father of all men-beings,<br>
 To you who dwell in the sky!</p>
 <p>Now you thought that there should be living creatures,<br>
 Inhabiting the waters, useful to the people.</p>
 <p><a name="page_89"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 89</font></a></p>
 <p>Now your thoughts have happened and we implore you that it may not be withdrawn,<br>
 Oh you who were born of Earth,<br>
 Oh you who dwell in the sky!<br>
 But may continue as long as earth endures.</p>
 <p>So now another.<br>
 You did think that there should be world<br>
 And that bushes should grow upon it for a help to the people,<br>
 That the bushes should yield various fruits for the benefit of men-beings,<br>
 Oh you who were born of Earth,<br>
 Oh you who dwell in the sky,<br>
 May this continue as long as earth endures!</p>
 <p>Now again the smoke arises,<br>
 Oh inhale the incense and continue to listen<br>
 Oh you who were born of Earth<br>
 Oh you who dwell in the sky!</p>
 <p>So now another.<br>
 Now you did think that there should be forests upon the earth<br>
 And that they might be a help to the people.<br>
 So now moreover you did think that there should be a certain tree<br>
 That should yield sweet water from its trunk.<br>
 Now that tree is the Maple and it is faithful to its design<br>
 May this continue to be,<br>
 Oh you who dwell in the sky!</p>
 <p>Now again the smoke arises,<br>
 And the people pray that this may still continue when the earth becomes warm again!<br>
 So now this thing is done.<br>
 Our words are as straight as we could make them.<br>
 Only this can we do for we are all young<br>
 Oh you who were born of Earth,<br>
 Oh you who dwell in the sky!<br>
 So now this one thing ends.</p>
 <p>So now another.<br>
 You have created wild animals that roam in the forests,<br>
 You did think that they would be a pleasure to men-beings</p>
 <p><a name="page_90"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 90</font></a></p>
 <p>Who should remember and say, "We are his descendants."<br>
 Now may they continue so to be,<br>
 Oh you who were born of Earth,<br>
 Oh you who dwell in the sky!</p>
 <p>So now another.<br>
 The people are speaking;<br>
 They are continuing from the commencement of creation<br>
 Discussing those things that you didst think would be a benefit to men-beings,<br>
 Oh you who were born of Earth,<br>
 Oh you who dwell in the sky!</p>
 <p>Now the birds that inhabit the air,<br>
 Birds from the low world to the great birds,<br>
 Birds that float above the clouds.<br>
 All these you did think would be a benefit to mankind.<br>
 Oh you who were born of Earth,<br>
 Oh you who dwell in the sky!<br>
 Now we ask that this thought should be forever<br>
 Even as long as earth endures.</p>
 <p>Now again the smoke arises,<br>
 Continue to listen as you inhale this incense,<br>
 For we are discussing the things of your creation<br>
 That you did think should be a benefit to mankind,<br>
 Oh you who were born of Earth,<br>
 Oh you who dwell in the sky!<br>
 Now you did think that there should be a world and that it should become cold,<br>
 At a recurring season become cold again.<br>
 Now we implore thee that it should not be too great a cold<br>
 And likewise when the earth becomes warm again,<br>
 That the heat should be moderate and comfortable.<br>
 Now again the smoke arises<br>
 To you who were born of Earth,<br>
 To you who dwell in the sky!</p>
 <p>So now another.<br>
 Continue to listen!<br>
 You did think that there should be a wind<br>
 And that it should be a help to the world.</p>
 <p><a name="page_91"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 91</font></a></p>
 <p>Now the wind is here.<br>
 And the people pray that it may continue to be so as long as earth endures.</p>
 <p>Now again the smoke arises<br>
 To you who were born of Earth,<br>
 To you who dwell in the sky!<br>
 Now they came from the west. Ti'so:t we call them,<br>
 Our great grandfathers the Thunderers;<br>
 You did make them our relatives.<br>
 They were placed in a high position<br>
 That they might care for the earth<br>
 And feed the waters that flow over the world and purify them,<br>
 And freshen all things that grow.<br>
 A certain season was appointed for their activity<br>
 The season when the earth commences to become warm again.<br>
 Now again the smoke arises,<br>
 It lifts our words to you,<br>
 Oh inhale the incense and continue to listen,<br>
 Oh you who were born of Earth,<br>
 Oh you who dwell in the sky!<br>
 Now the whole world prays that you will listen,<br>
 May all these things continue as long as earth endures,<br>
 Oh you who were born of Earth,<br>
 Oh you who dwell in the sky!</p>
 <p>So now again another.<br>
 You did think that there should be a sky<br>
 And that within it should be something to illuminate the world,<br>
 Ênde:'ka gää`'kwa, our great brother, the mighty warrior, the Sun,<br>
 And that so it should be called so.<br>
 He has a high position that shall last as long as earth endures.<br>
 Now again the smoke arises and so smoke tobacco as you listen,<br>
 Oh you who were born of Earth,<br>
 Oh you who dwell in the sky!<br>
 Now the people of all earth with one voice implore you<br>
 That your plan may be carried out and continue as long as earth endures,<br>
 So do your descendants pray.</p>
 <p><a name="page_92"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 92</font></a></p>
 <p>So now another.<br>
 It is of Soi'ka: gää`'kwa, our grandmother, the Moon in the sky.<br>
 You did make her a sign for reckoning the years of children.<br>
 Now she has fulfilled the design of her creation so far.<br>
 Now again the smoke arises.<br>
 Inhale the incense as you continue to listen,<br>
 Oh you who were born of Earth,<br>
 Oh you who dwell in the sky!<br>
 Through the smoke we pray that this may be so as long as earth endures,<br>
 So pray your descendants,<br>
 Oh you who were born of Earth,<br>
 Oh you who dwell in the sky!<br>
 So have they said,<br>
 Oh you who were born of Earth,<br>
 Oh you who dwell in the sky!</p>
 <p>Now you did think that there should be a sky<br>
 And that spots should be in the sky<br>
 For signs unto the people.<br>
 So did you design this to be so as long as the earth endures.<br>
 And the people implore thee that this may continue to be as long as the earth endures.<br>
 Now again the smoke arises,<br>
 And through it the people speak.<br>
 Oh inhale as you continue to listen,<br>
 Oh you who were born of Earth,<br>
 Oh you who dwell in the sky!<br>
 Now you did design all that which should occur in the world,<br>
 And planned the four sacred ceremonies<br>
 That should be perpetuated forever<br>
 And celebrated by the people each year.<br>
 Be celebrated by these who call themselves your descendants,<br>
 That there should be head ones and their assistants<br>
 To perpetuate the four ceremonies.<br>
 Now as many men-beings as remain on earth are here,<br>
 Gathered about this pole.<br>
 Now then you have seen that we commenced at the new part of day.<br>
 Now you shall know that you are invited to listen to thanking songs this day!</p>
 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman" size="2"><p>[The head chief yells Yokadi!, Gowagannie!<br>
 The people answer wo? wo? wo?!]</p>
 <p><a name="page_93"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 93</font></a></p>
 <p>Now tomorrow morning you must consider yourself invited to the Great Feather Dance!</p>
 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman" size="2"><p>[Cries by the head chief Hioh, hiu, hiu, hiu!<br>
 The People answer Io? io? io? io? io?!]</p>
 <p>Two parts will be celebrated, the Great Feather Dance and the Harvest Thanksgiving.</p>
 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman" size="2"><p>[Cries by the head chief; Ganio ganio ganio!<br>
 Answers by the people Ho-ni ho-ni!]</p>
 <p>These two ceremonies will be in progress tomorrow,<br>
 Oh you who were born of Earth,<br>
 Oh you who dwell in the sky<br>
 And the next day you are: invited to the sacred game.</p>
 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman" size="2"><p>[Cries by the head chief, Ba-a?! ba-a?! ba-a?! ba-a?! ba-a?!<br>
 Answers by the people, Hoie! hoie! hoie! hoie!]</p>
 <p>Now again the smoke arises<br>
 The incense of the sacred tobacco,<br>
 To you who were born of Earth,<br>
 Yet dwell in the sky<br>
 Only this can we do<br>
 To fulfil the law.<br>
 All the things of your creation that you have made visible to us<br>
 We thank you for and for all the things that you have created.<br>
 In the manner that you did think, we have thanked you,<br>
 From low earth upward to the great sky where you are living.<br>
 With all their strength the people thank you and you have seen it,<br>
 Oh you who were born of Earth,<br>
 Oh you who dwell in the sky!<br>
 So now it is done.<br>
 Now you did think that you would appoint four messengers whose work should be to watch over earth<br>
 And the people that dwell in the world<br>
 To keep them all from harm,<br>
 For men-beings are your children.<br>
 Now do I say, the voices of the people combine as one<br>
 To thank you.<br>
 We have done as best we can in giving thanks to the four messengers.<br>
 Now again-the smoke arises,<br>
 And we speak through its incense.<br>
 Inhale the smoke as you do listen.<br>
 Oh the great Handsome Lake!</p>
 <p><a name="page_94"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 94</font></a></p>
 <p>We believe that he is happy in the place that you have prepared for him.<br>
 Moreover we thank him.<br>
 Oh you who were born of Earth,<br>
 Oh you who dwell in the sky!<br>
 Now only this can we do.<br>
 You thought that it should be this way,<br>
 Oh you that were born of Earth,<br>
 Oh you who dwell in the sky!<br>
 Now we thank you, the Creator of the World.<br>
 Here are gathered so many people as remain,<br>
 Few head men remain.<br>
 Only this can we do, .<br>
 And they say how the people should act.<br>
 Of the head men and their cousins only so many are left,<br>
 [But they with] the men and the women<br>
 The children that run and the children that creep<br>
 As one man-being offer you thanks.<br>
 They are your descendants,<br>
 Oh you who dwell in the sky!<br>
 Now you did think that we should offer you tobacco when we addressed you.<br>
 And we have fulfilled your request and used tobacco.<br>
 We leave our words with you until the next great thanksgiving,<br>
 Until then may the people continue in health.<br>
 Now the smoke arises!<br>
 Oh inhale as you do listen!<br>
 Only this can we do<br>
 For all the words are spoken<br>
 To you, our great ancestor,<br>
 Oh you who dwell in the sky.<br>
 Oh you who were born of Earth!</p>
