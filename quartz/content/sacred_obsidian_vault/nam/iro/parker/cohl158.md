 <h3 align="CENTER">O`GI'WE:, OÄ'NO?, CHANTERS FOR THE DEAD</h3>
 <p>The O`gi'we: ceremony is called for by any member who dreams of the restless spirit of some former member, relative, or friend. At the ceremony the set of songs is sung, the large water drum beaten, and a feast indulged in. The food is supposed to satisfy the hungry ghosts that for some reason are "earth-bound," as spiritists might express it. The O`gi'we: ceremony must not be confused with the Death Feast ceremony, which is a clan affair. The diviner of the O`gi'we: people is able to identify the unknown spirit which may be troubling the dreams of a member. The sickness and ill fortune caused by evil ghosts may be dispelled by the ceremony. The chief officer is a woman.</p>
