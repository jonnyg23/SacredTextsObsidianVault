 <h3 align="CENTER">THE OPENING OR TOBACCO THROWING CEREMONY OF THE FALSE FACE COMPANY</h3>
 <p>Now receive you this tobacco, you, Shagodiowê<sup>n</sup>'gowa, the great false face.<br>
 Now it is that you have come to where your grandchildren are gathered.<br>
 Now you are taking the place of the great false faces who are wandering in the rocky valleys and mountains.<br>
 Now you are the ones who think much of this sacred tobacco.<br>
 Now we wish to make a request of you. So we always offer this sacred tobacco [literally, real tobacco], when we ask anything of you.<br>
 We pray that you help us with your power.<br>
 You can go over all the earth.<br>
 In the center of the earth is a great pine tree and that is the place of your resting. It is there that you rub your rattle when you come to rest.</p>
 <p><a name="page_129"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 129</font></a></p>
 <p>Now then this tree receives this tobacco.<br>
 We ask that you watch over us and exercise your power to protect us from anything harmful.<br>
 We hold in mind that you have ever done your duty in past times and we ask that you continue [vigilant] henceforth.<br>
 We use this tobacco when we ask favors of you for you are very fond of this tobacco.<br>
 Now your cane gets tobacco. The great pine tree to its top is your cane.<br>
 Now you, the husk faces, you get tobacco also.<br>
 You have been associated with the false faces in times past. Now you receive tobacco for you have done your duty.<br>
 So it is finished.</p>
