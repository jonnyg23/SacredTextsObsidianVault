 <p>"'Now another message.</p>
 <p>"'Now the Creator of mankind ordained that people should live to an old age. He appointed that when a woman becomes old she should be without strength and unable to work. <a name="fr_30"></a><a href="cohl031.htm#fn_30"><font size="1">1</font></a> Now the Creator says that it is a great wrong to be unkind to our grandmothers. The Creator forbids unkindness to the old. We, the messengers, say it. The Creator appointed this way: he designed that an old woman should be as a child again and when she becomes so the Creator wishes the grandchildren to help her, for only because she is, they are. Whosoever does right to the aged does right in the sight of the Creator.'"</p>
 <p>So they said and he said. Eniaiehuk.</p>
 <p>(So many words, Odi'waga?'de, end of first day's preaching)</p>
