 <p>"'Now another message of things not right.</p>
 <p>"'People do wrong in the world and the Creator looks at all things.</p>
 <p>"'A woman sees some green vegetables and they are not hers. She takes them wrongly. Now she is yeno<sup>n</sup>'skwaswa'do<sup>n</sup>?, a thieving woman. Tell your people that petty thieving must cease.' So they said.</p>
 <p>"'Now the Creator gave Diohe?'ko<sup>n</sup> <a name="fr_33"></a><a href="#fn_33"><font size="1">2</font></a> for a living. When a woman sees a new crop and wishes to eat of it in her own house, she must ask the owner for a portion and offer payment. Then may the owner use her judgment and accept recompense or give the request freely.'" <a name="fr_34"></a><a href="#fn_34"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>
 <p>So they said and he said. Eniaiehuk.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_34"></a><a href="cohl039.htm#fr_34">39:3</a> One of the old methods of gardening was to clear a small patch in the woods by girdling the trees and planting in the mellow forest mold. The name and totem of the owner of the garden was painted on a post, signifying that the ground was private property. The clan totem gave permission to any hard-pressed clansman to take what he wished in emergency but only in such a case. These isolated gardens in the forests were objects of temptation sometimes, as the prophet intimates.</p>
