 <h3 align="CENTER">THE DEAD MAN REVIVES</h3>
 <p>Now Tää'wônyâs is speaking. "Are you well? What think you? (Isege<sup>n</sup>' onênt'gayei` hênesni'goê`)?"</p>
 <p>Now the people notice that the man is moving his lips as if speaking but no words come. Now this is near the noon hour. Now all are silent while Tää'wônyâs asks again, "My uncle, are you feeling well? (onigênt'gaiye`)."</p>
 <p>Then comes the answer, "Yes I believe myself well." So these are the first words Ganio`dai'io` spoke ("Iwi`' nai' o'nê't?gai'ye hê?' nekni'goê<sup>n</sup>").</p>
 <p>Now then he speaks again saying, "Never have I seen such wondrous visions! Now at first I heard some one speaking. Some one spoke and said, 'Come out awhile' and said this three times. Now since I saw no one speaking I thought that in my sickness I myself was speaking but I thought again and found that it was not my voice. So I called out boldly, 'Niio?!' and arose and went out and there standing in the clear swept space I saw three men clothed in fine clean raiment. Their cheeks were painted red and it seemed that they had been painted the day before. Only a few feathers were in their bonnets. All three were alike and all seemed middle aged. Never before have I seen such handsome commanding men and they had in one hand bows and arrows as canes. Now in their other hands were huckleberry bushes and the berries were of every color.</p>
 <p>"Then said the beings, addressing me, 'He who created the world at the beginning employed us to come to earth. Our visit now is not the only one we have made. He commanded us saying "Go once more down upon the earth and [this time] visit him who thinks of me. He is grateful for my creations, moreover he wishes to rise from sickness and walk'[in health] upon the earth. Go you and help him to recover."' Then said the messengers, 'Take these berries and eat of every color. They will give you strength and your people with us will help you rise.' So I took and ate the berries. Then said the beings, 'On the morrow we will have it that a fire will be in the bushes and a medicine steeped to give you strength. We will appoint Odjis'kwâthê<sup>n</sup> <a name="fr_18"></a><a href="#fn_18"><font size="1">1</font></a> and Gayänt`gogwûs, <a name="fr_19"></a><a href="#fn_19"><font size="1">2</font></a> a man and his wife, to make the medicine. Now they are the best of all the medicine people. Early in the morning we will see them and at that time you will have the medicine for your use, and before noon the unused medicine will be cast away because you will</p>

 <p>have recovered. Now moreover before noon many people will gather at the council house. These people will be your relatives and will see you. They will have gathered the early strawberries <a name="fr_20"></a><a href="#fn_20"><font size="1">1</font></a> and made a strawberry feast, and moreover will have strawberry wine sweetened with sugar. Then will all drink the juice of the berry and thank the Creator for your recovery and moreover they severally will call upon you by your name as a relative according as you are.'</p>
 <p>"Now when the day came I went as appointed and all the people saw me coming and it was as predicted."</p>
