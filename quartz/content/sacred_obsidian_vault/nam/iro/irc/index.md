 <p>This is a set of literal translations of three Iroquois creation
 myths, from the Onondaga, Seneca and Mohawk tribes respectively.
 The interlinear translations in the original have been omitted for
 technical reasons.
 These myths are of great interest for several reasons.
 The Iroquois Confederation was the dominant culture group in the
 northeastern region at the time of European contact, and as such
 has maintained its traditions in a fairly intact state.
 There are minor infiltrations of Biblical elements in the narrative,
 which are, however, easy to recognize.</p>
 <p>
 The Iroquois had a matrilinear culture in which men and women
 shared power, which is reflected in this myth by the strong
 participation of female demi-gods in the creation.
 The translation is by an experienced anthropologist writing for
 an academic audience and so it is almost completely free of the sentimentality
 and prudishness that infected other contemporary books about
 Native American mythology and folklore.
