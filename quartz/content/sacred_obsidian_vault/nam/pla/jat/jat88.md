 <h3 align="CENTER">86. AVOIDANCE OF THE MOTHER-IN-LAW.</h3>
 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>The woman was afraid of deer raiser, the man who floated down. It is their custom to be afraid of each other. When a man becomes a woman's son-in-law she is afraid of him. The man also is afraid of his mother-in-law. He does not go close to her. If a man happens to talk to his brother-in-law he feels good about it. That is why it is good that way, he said. <a name="fr_84"></a><a href="jat89.htm#fn_84"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>
