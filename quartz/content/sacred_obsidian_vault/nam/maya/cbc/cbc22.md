 <h3 align="CENTER">(AN INCANTATION)</h3>
 <p>Strung end to end are the precious stones, the red precious stones, representing the substance of heaven, the moisture of heaven. <a name="fr_612"></a><a href="#fn_609"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>
 <p>The form in which you created the sun, &lt;in which&gt; you created the earth! The form of the moisture of heaven, the substance of heaven, the yellow blossom <a name="fr_613"></a><a href="#fn_610"><font size="1">4</font></a> of heaven! How did I create your sun? &lt;How did I&gt; create your moon? How did I create your precious stones? I created you. When you were sprinkled with water, you remembered the force of the sun. Then when the message was sent to you ... Under cover I created you, I set you &lt;where you are&gt;. From time to time I take &lt;you&gt;, I perceive your vigor because of your father. You await ... that I may take away ... from your mouth. They are the yellow precious stones. So runs its course as he records <a name="fr_614"></a><a href="#fn_611"><font size="1">5</font></a> it. These are the rulers <a name="fr_615"></a><a href="#fn_612"><font size="1">6</font></a> which have been set in order. Go and read it and you will understand it. <a name="fr_616"></a><a href="#fn_613"><font size="1">7</font></a></p>

 <p><a name="fn_607"></a><a href="cbc21.htm#fr_610">131:1</a> The text reads <i>un trus nicte</i>. <i>Nicte</i> is a flower, usually the Plumeria. <i>Trus</i>, since it contains an r is probably a distorted Spanish word. The translation given here is derived from a comparison of the use of the expression on p. 118 of B.L.C. No. 43 and that of a similar Maya phrase, <i>oxlahun tzuc nicte</i> on page 174 of the same manuscript. The translator is inclined to associate this expression with the love-charm described by Aguilar (Aguilar 1892, p. 84; translated in Saville 1921, p. 207).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_608"></a><a href="cbc21.htm#fr_611">131:2</a> Maya, <i>pectzil</i>. This word usually means news or what is said of some one. Here something concrete appears to be intended, and the word has been divided into its component parts, <i>pec</i> and <i>tzil</i>, which give a very different meaning.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_609"></a><a href="cbc22.htm#fr_612">131:3</a> Maya: <i>kab caan itz caan</i>. When asked who he was, Itzamat-ul, a deified ruler of Izamal, replied: "<i>Itz en caan, itz en muyal</i>." This has been translated: "<i>Yo soy el rocío, ó sustancia del cielo y nubes</i>" (Cogolludo 1868, Book 4, chap. 8).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_610"></a><a href="cbc22.htm#fr_613">131:4</a> <i>Cf.</i> p. 65, note  <a href="cbc06.htm#fn_52"><font size="1">9</font></a>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_611"></a><a href="cbc22.htm#fr_614">131:5</a> To obtain this meaning <i>¢olic</i> (he skins it) has been changed to <i>tzolic</i> (he records it).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_612"></a><a href="cbc22.htm#fr_615">131:6</a> Ahau (ruler) is the day for which the katun is named.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_613"></a><a href="cbc22.htm#fr_616">131:7</a> This very difficult passage differs in vocabulary and style from the rest of the MS. The spaces left in the text indicate that the Eighteenth Century compiler copied it from a defective original. Its unique style resembles that of Gates' Ritual of the Bacabs, which was probably written in eastern Yucatan, judging from a comparison of the latter with the Titulos de Ebtun. The translator is familiar only with a few extracts from the Ritual of the Bacabs, but it is possible that the above passage has been copied from that manuscript. <i>Cf.</i> Tozzer 1921, p. 196. We suggest that this is an invocation to the growing corn. Possibly the last three sentences refer to the following chapter.</p>
