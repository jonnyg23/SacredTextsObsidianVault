 <h3 align="CENTER">(THE RITUAL OF THE ANGELS) <a name="fr_386"></a><a href="#fn_384"><font size="1">2</font></a></h3>
 <i></i><p>Dominus vobiscum ended the words of their song when there was neither heaven nor earth. When the world was submerged, when there was neither heaven nor earth, the three-cornered precious stone <a name="fr_387"></a><a href="#fn_385"><font size="1">3</font></a>of grace was born, after the divinity of the ruler was created, <a name="fr_388"></a><a href="#fn_386"><font size="1">4</font></a> when there was no heaven. Then there were born seven tuns, seven katuns, hanging in the heart of the wind, <a name="fr_389"></a><a href="#fn_387"><font size="1">5</font></a> the seven chosen ones. Then, they say, their seven graces <a name="fr_390"></a><a href="#fn_388"><font size="1">6</font></a> stirred also. Seven also were their holy images. <a name="fr_391"></a><a href="#fn_389"><font size="1">7</font></a> While they were still untarnished, occurred the birth of the first precious stone of grace, the first infinite <a name="fr_392"></a><a href="#fn_390"><font size="1">8</font></a> grace, when there was infinite night, when there was no God. Not yet had he received his Godhead. <a name="fr_393"></a><a href="#fn_391"><font size="1">9</font></a> Then he remained alone within the grace, within the night, when there was neither heaven nor earth. Then he departed <a name="fr_394"></a><a href="#fn_392"><font size="1">10</font></a> at the end of the katun, as he could not be born in the first katun. There were his long locks of hair, <i>adeu ti paramii</i>; <a name="fr_395"></a><a href="#fn_393"><font size="1">11</font></a> his divinity came to him when he departed.</p>

 <p>Thereupon he became man in the second infinite precious stone of grace. Then there arrived in the second katun Alpilcon, as the angel was named when he was born. The second grace was permitted to depart in the second infinite night, when no one was present. Then he received his divinity, alone and through his own effort, when he came to depart. "<i>O firmar</i>" he said, when he received his divinity by / </p><table align="RIGHT" width="10%" cellpadding="8">

  himself and through his own effort.
 <p>Thereupon he departed and went to the third infinite precious stone of grace. Alba Congel was the name of its angel. This was the third grace.</p>
 <p>Let me proceed to the fourth infinite precious stone of grace, to the fourth night. Atea Ohe was the name of its angel. The fourth grace was born and began to speak, alone and through his own effort. "Oh god, the ruler! I am after all nothing in myself." These were his words in his concealment, in his divinity within the grace. "Let me still proceed," he said.</p>
 <p>Then he went to the fifth infinite precious stone of grace, to the fifth infinite night. The fifth grace was born <a name="fr_396"></a><a href="#fn_394"><font size="1">1</font></a> in the fifth katun. Thereupon he was set up to declare his divinity. Then his angel was born; Decipto was the name of his angel when he was set up. "Since it is so, let me go. Who might I be? I am a god, a ruler, after all," and he declared his divinity all alone. "<i>A ninite dei sin</i>," he said when he received his divinity all by himself.</p>
 <p>Then he went to the sixth infinite precious stone of grace, to the sixth measured night, to the sixth katun: "Ye gods, ye rulers! Make answer to my words. After all, I am nothing in myself alone."</p>
 <p>The seventh grace was born. Conlamil was the name of his angel. "I deliver the things of god to you who are gods. <a name="fr_397"></a><a href="#fn_395"><font size="1">2</font></a> Answer my words. After all, there is no one; no one replies to my words." Thus he spoke as he caused the seventh grace to be born. And there was joy in his heart at the birth of the seventh katun, the seven lights, the seventh measured night &lt;and&gt; the seven infinite &lt;things&gt;.</p>

Seven were the generations of his angels. <a name="fr_399"></a><a href="#fn_397"><font size="1">1</font></a> Four times did he first speak. There was one seal <a name="fr_400"></a><a href="#fn_398"><font size="1">2</font></a> in the darkness, one seal on high. "I am the beginning and I shall be the end." Here are his words in their mighty entirety. "<i>Datate</i> here to that which has been received.

Xicluto-tu-tanil was the name of the wind. Virtutus was the name of the wind. Joramis was the name of the wind in the second katun. This was what he said when he changed the stone: "<i>Jaxyonlacalpa</i>." He covered the name of the holy heaven which our holy Lord, the Father raised up. Bolay <a name="fr_405"></a><a href="#fn_403"><font size="1">7</font></a> was the name of the serpent of the second heaven.

Then Lonmias <a name="fr_407"></a><a href="#fn_405"><font size="1">9</font></a> was formed. The sharp stone was his stone within the night.

 <p>Then, it is said, the boldness <a name="fr_413"></a><a href="#fn_411"><font size="1">2</font></a> of the heaven on high was created. This was one grace, one stone; then fire was created, Tixitate was his name, the light of the heavens. Sustinal, they say, was the light from that which lighted the heaven. Acpa, it was, who made the katun after the light originated in the heavens. Alpa-u-manga was his name after it ended.</p>
 <p>&lt;These are&gt; the angels <a name="fr_414"></a><a href="#fn_412"><font size="1">3</font></a> of the winds which were set up while he created the star, when the world was not yet lighted, when there was neither heaven nor earth: the Red Pauahtun, the White Pauahtun, the Black Pauahtun, the Yellow Pauahtun. <a name="fr_415"></a><a href="#fn_413"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>

  spoke alone, by his own efforts, in the darkness that clung like a thrice withered fruit &lt;to the tree&gt;. This was the first word of God, when there was neither heaven nor earth, when he came out of the stone and fell into the second stone. Then it was that he declared his divinity. Then resounded eight thousand katuns at the word of the first stone of grace, the first ornamented <a name="fr_426"></a><a href="#fn_424"><font size="1">7</font></a> stone of grace.

 <p><a name="fn_384"></a><a href="cbc16.htm#fr_386">107:2</a> The following ritual is an example of the manner in which the Maya superimposed Christian doctrines on their own religious conceptions. An account of what we might call the Americanization of Christianity will be found in Appendix G.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_385"></a><a href="cbc16.htm#fr_387">107:3</a> Maya <i>tun</i>. This usually means a precious stone, while an ordinary stone or rock is called tunich. <i>Tun</i> also means the pit of a fruit as well as the soft surface limestone of the country. In compound words designating things made of stone we find the same term employed; furthermore <i>tun</i> is the name of the Maya time-period of 365 days. It is important to the interpretation of this chapter to note that among the Maya the Spanish word <i>gracia</i>, here literally translated as "grace," is a ritualistic term employed to designate the young maize plant (information supplied by Dr. Redfield). Consequently the "three-cornered precious stone of grace" is doubtless also a liturgical term indicating a grain of corn.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_386"></a><a href="cbc16.htm#fr_388">107:4</a> Alternative translation: was declared.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_387"></a><a href="cbc16.htm#fr_389">107:5</a> Alternative translation: in the heart of the spirit. <i>Ik</i> may mean either wind, breath or spirit.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_388"></a><a href="cbc16.htm#fr_390">107:6</a> Written <i>grasiail</i> in the text.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_389"></a><a href="cbc16.htm#fr_391">107:7</a> Written <i>santoil</i> in the text.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_390"></a><a href="cbc16.htm#fr_392">107:8</a> Maya <i>picib</i>, here translated as though it were <i>picil</i> which means innumerable.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_391"></a><a href="cbc16.htm#fr_393">107:9</a> Written <i>Diosil</i> in the text.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_392"></a><a href="cbc16.htm#fr_394">107:10</a> Here <i>buki</i> is translated as though it were <i>luki</i>, he departed. <i>Buki</i> means to be beaten up, like wax, or as soil is pulverized for cultivation.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_393"></a><a href="cbc16.htm#fr_395">107:11</a> Either for the purpose of mystification or to add solemnity to the ritual, this chapter is filled with Spanish and Latin words and names heard in the Christian church service. Here the "long locks of hair" are probably a reference to the corn-silk.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_394"></a><a href="cbc16.htm#fr_396">108:1</a> It is possible that this word <i>zihil</i> should be translated as "originated" here, as we can not be sure that the "grace" or maize plant, is personified. The Spanish words for grace and angel often have a Maya suffix. The names of the angels are unfamiliar to the translator, but they are certainly not Maya.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_395"></a><a href="cbc16.htm#fr_397">108:2</a> The Maya text: "<i>Ten kul u ba ku tex ku exe</i>," is translated as though it read: <i>Ten kub u bal ku tex ku exe</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_396"></a><a href="cbc16.htm#fr_398">108:3</a> In all this abracadabra only the words, <i>zipil na</i>, appear to be Maya and might possibly be translated as "house of sin." The reader is reminded that the sounds of d, f, g and r do not occur in the Maya language. Consequently the remainder appears to be a mixture of corrupted Latin and Spanish, and, it is to be suspected, meant little more to the Maya writer than "eena meena mina mo" does to the American child who recites the formula.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_397"></a><a href="cbc16.htm#fr_399">109:1</a> Maya <i>cangel</i>, or <i>canhel</i>, the genuine Maya "angel," who was probably a wind-spirit. <i>Cf.</i> P. 67, note  <a href="cbc07.htm#fn_68"><font size="1">5</font></a>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_398"></a><a href="cbc16.htm#fr_400">109:2</a> Maya <i>¢alab</i>, defined as a seal or mold. Literally it means "that which is pressed down on something." The reference is to the terra cotta stamps or molds employed in decorating pottery, and it is possible that they were also used to stamp certain decorations on the human body.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_399"></a><a href="cbc16.htm#fr_401">109:3</a> Of these italicized words, <i>Anuni</i> is the only one which is not intended for Latin or Spanish. Possibly it is either a corrupted Nahuatl form or one taken from the Chol-Tzeltal group of languages.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_400"></a><a href="cbc16.htm#fr_402">109:4</a> Possibly a reference to "Egyptian darkness."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_401"></a><a href="cbc16.htm#fr_403">109:5</a> From here on, the <i>tun</i> appears to refer to a stela or monument.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_402"></a><a href="cbc16.htm#fr_404">109:6</a> Maya <i>ik</i>, here translated as wind, also means breath, life and spirit. "<i>El espíritu, vida y aliento</i>." Motul.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_403"></a><a href="cbc16.htm#fr_405">109:7</a> <i>Bolay</i>, the general name for a beast of prey.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_404"></a><a href="cbc16.htm#fr_406">109:8</a> Apparently a corruption of some form of the Latin <i>sustineo</i> and <i>gracia</i>, in which case it would probably mean "sustaining grace," or in other words, the maize plant which is our sustenance.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_405"></a><a href="cbc16.htm#fr_407">109:9</a> Lonmias may be a corruption of Hieronymus.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_406"></a><a href="cbc16.htm#fr_408">109:10</a> Zihontun might be translated as the created stone.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_407"></a><a href="cbc16.htm#fr_409">109:11</a> Alternative translation: the red pointed stone.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_408"></a><a href="cbc16.htm#fr_410">109:12</a> This mixture of Latin and Maya could be translated: I fill out the heavens.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_409"></a><a href="cbc16.htm#fr_411">109:13</a> Possibly the <i>Cielo Empireo</i> is meant.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_410"></a><a href="cbc16.htm#fr_412">110:1</a> The Maya carried mirrors, possibly on the back or shoulder.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_411"></a><a href="cbc16.htm#fr_413">110:2</a> Alternative translation: the bold one, the mad one, the turbulent one; possibly this is a confused recollection of the story of Lucifer. A Maya legend much resembling the Lucifer story is reported from Yucatan (Relaciones de Yucatan, I, p. 177).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_412"></a><a href="cbc16.htm#fr_414">110:3</a> Maya, <i>cangeles ik</i>. The reference is evidently to the so-called "angels," one of whom was set on the back of the image of the Red Bacab in the ceremony pertaining to the year ascribed to the east. This "angel" was a sign of good rains and favorable crops. Easterly winds have always been favorably regarded by the Maya, and the translator believes that this cangel (Landa's "angel" and Beltran's "dragon") was a wind-spirit. It probably looked more like a dragon than an angel. As we see here, there were four of them, and the word itself could well be translated as "the four changing ones." Consequently our "angels of the wind" would be originally the "four changing winds." <i>Cf.</i> p. 67, note  <a href="cbc07.htm#fn_68"><font size="1">5</font></a>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_413"></a><a href="cbc16.htm#fr_415">110:4</a> This passage confirms Baeza's account of the <i>misa milpera</i> (quoted in Brinton 1890, p. 166), in which it is stated that the four Pauahtuns are identical with the winds and the four cardinal points from which they blow. A discussion of the four cardinal points and the deities associated with them will be found in Appendix A.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_414"></a><a href="cbc16.htm#fr_416">110:5</a> Maya, <i>kabalil</i>, is the primitive Yucatecan potter's wheel, which is only a block of wood on which the pot is turned by the feet of the potter. See Tozzer 1907, Plate 13, fig. 3. In the Codex Cortesianus (pp. 20-21 d), we see a wheel-like ceremonial object held by four bird-headed figures. The pictures illustrate a <i>tzol-kin</i> (or tonalamatl) divided into four parts and beginning with the day 4 Ik (4 Wind).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_415"></a><a href="cbc16.htm#fr_417">110:6</a> We find several unexplained references to "measuring the land." <i>Cf.</i> <a href="cbc06.htm#page_65">p. 65</a>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_416"></a><a href="cbc16.htm#fr_418">110:7</a> We find in the Books of Chilam Balam of Ixil and Kaua a diagram on which the earth is enclosed within eleven spheres labeled Luna, Mercurio, Venus, Sol, Marte, Jupiter, Saturno, Firmamento (containing the fixed stars), Christalino, Primer Mobil and Cielo Empireo. It is, of course, the popular idea of Ptolmaic astronomy in vogue at the time, and was not unlike the native conception of thirteen heavens, of which the earth itself counted as the first.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_417"></a><a href="cbc16.htm#fr_419">110:8</a> Possible alternative translation: The blessing of the Father, etc.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_418"></a><a href="cbc16.htm#fr_420">111:1</a> Sprinkling with a consecrated liquid was an ancient Maya ceremony. Landa 1928, p. 184.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_419"></a><a href="cbc16.htm#fr_421">111:2</a> Alternative translation: when they (the angels) were scattered.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_420"></a><a href="cbc16.htm#fr_422">111:3</a> <i>Balam</i> is a general term for jaguar, but it can also mean priest. <i>Chac-bolay</i> is <i>Felis hernandesii goldmani</i> Mearns; but it was also the name of a certain evil spirit, and spreading the skin of this jaguar in the market-place was a symbol of war, famine and pestilence (Tizimin, p. 30).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_421"></a><a href="cbc16.htm#fr_423">111:4</a> Balamté is the <i>Theobroma bicolor</i> Humb. &amp; Bonpl.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_422"></a><a href="cbc16.htm#fr_424">111:5</a> Maya, <i>u lamay tun</i>, probably the planted seed corn. The definition of this phrase, "the square stone," symbolizing the twenty years of the katun, has long been accepted. The word for squared, however, is <i>amay</i>, not <i>lamay</i>, which means sunk out of sight, hidden. <i>Cf.</i> Chumayel, p. 163, where we read of the "hell which is sunken within the world."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_423"></a><a href="cbc16.htm#fr_425">111:6</a> Little, if any, of this hocus-pocus is Maya, and it is the conjecture of the translator that its source was some itinerant Spanish fortune-teller or astrologer. <i>Cf.</i> Aguilar 1900, p. 80. The repetition of the word <i>gracia</i> suggests an incantation to make the corn grow.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_424"></a><a href="cbc16.htm#fr_426">111:7</a> Literally, embroidered. Maya: <i>hun piliz tun de gracia</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_425"></a><a href="cbc16.htm#fr_427">111:8</a> This reference recalls the legend of the divine macaw which brought down from heaven the fire to consume the sacrifice to Kinich Kakmó, the sun-god, at Izamal (Cogolludo 1868, 1, p. 319). For an account of the <i>acantun</i>, see page 114, note  <a href="cbc17.htm#fn_434"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_426"></a><a href="cbc16.htm#fr_428">111:9</a> The text is confused here and the translation a little uncertain.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_427"></a><a href="cbc16.htm#fr_429">112:1</a> Probably a fanciful conception of the structure of the maize-kernel.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_428"></a><a href="cbc16.htm#fr_430">112:2</a> Possibly this is a reference to the name first given to the Spaniards. They were called "suckers of anonas," because they were seen eating the pond-apple, an insipid fruit not considered edible by the natives.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_429"></a><a href="cbc16.htm#fr_431">112:3</a> Here as elsewhere Don Juan de Montejo is confused with his father, Don Francisco, the Spanish conqueror. The door of the old Montejo mansion in Merida faces north, not east, and it is the belief of the translator that this reference is not to the actual house of Montejo, but to the compartment, or so-called "house," of the katun-wheel in which is pictured Katun 11 Ahau, the first katun of the Spanish Conquest in which Montejo ruled the country. The katun-wheel on page 132 of the Chumayel ascribes Katun 11 Ahau to the east.</p>
