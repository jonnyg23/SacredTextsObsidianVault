 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Sea-Song and Storm-Song<br> And drums of the night,<br> Drums of love's footfall beating through the dark;<br> Wind of my pulse and a breaking tide,<br> And my cry the one note, the one note,<br> Piercing the sky like a star over thee<br> O See-Gooltha maq-ha-ten-tle,<br> See-Gooltha with the two high breasts!  
 <p>I am come as a river between hills,<br> Meeting the sea among cliffs—<br> O Waters surging to Waters in the monotoned might of the war-chant,<br> With the sod sounding back,<br> And thy voice—! sweet to the hunter's ear<br> Is the shrill arrowed hawk before the wind!<br> O See-Gooltha maq-ha-ten-tle,<br> Thy kiss opens the dark<br> And the moon unfolds in thine eyes.</p>  
 <p>Thunders of breaking day<br> Long foaming surf-lines of light<br> Sweep the morning beaches,<br> Blown by winds that march and sing:<br> Tall winds, with hunters' feet, swift and trackless,</p></div>
