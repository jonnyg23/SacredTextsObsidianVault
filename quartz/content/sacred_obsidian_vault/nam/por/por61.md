 <p align="center"><b>FROM THE YOKUT</b></p>  
 <p align="center"><b>BEING THE SONG OF A MAN AND A WOMAN WHO MIGHT HAVE LOVED</b></p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">This is the song of the Hills<br> In the hour when they talk together,<br> When the alpen glow dies down in the west and leaves the heavens tender;<br> In the pure and shadowless hour<br> When the Mountains talk together;  
 <p>"Fir tree leaneth to fir,<br> The wind-blown willows mingle;</p></div>

 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Clouds draw each to each, dissolve, depart, and renew one another;<br> But the strong Hills hold asunder.  
 <p>"Had we been less we had loved;<br> We had stooped and been tender;</p>  
 <p>"But our hands are under the earth<br> For the travail of her harvests,<br> Upholding the rain-sleeked fields<br> And the long, brown, fruitful furrow.<br> Terror taketh the earth<br> When the Mountains move together.</p>  
 <p>"But ever as winds of Spring<br> Set the meadow grasses caressing,<br> And the coo-dove's call.<br> To the coo-dove's mate<br> Resounds in the oak-wood valleys,<br> We shall thrill with the brooding earth,<br> We shall turn, touch hands, and remember,<br> Had we been less, how much we had loved<br> How nobly we might have been tender."</p></div>
