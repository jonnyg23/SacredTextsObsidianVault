 <p align="center"><b>THE TOM-TOM</b></p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">    Drum-beat, beat of drums,<br> Pebble-rattle in the gourd,<br> Pebble feet on drifting sand…<br> Drum-beat, beat of drums<br> I have lost the wife-made robe of bearskin…<br> Take the prize—mine the loss.<br> Have I lost too the courage of the black bear—<br> His power, his thunder?<br> Lul-la-by,<br> Games' queer lullaby…<br> O robe of mine!—<br> O luck of mine!  
 <p>    Drum-beat, beat of drums,<br> Pebble-rattle in the gourd,<br> Coyote feet upon the plain…<br> Drum-beat, beat of drums—<br> Coyotes crushed the tender ham-string and the bone…<br> A bull-calf bawls, dies alone.<br> Where are the herds of buffalo and the hides,<br> The meat, the tepees?<br> Lul-la-by,<br> Man's dread lullaby…<br> O home of mine!<br> O life of mine!</p>  
 <p>    Drum-beat, beat of drums,<br> Pebble-rattle in the gourd,<br> Horse-hoof beat upon the ground…<br> Drum-beat, beat of drums<br> By Wounded Knee ye buried them, buried them—<br> Red men's flesh, their bones…</p></div>

 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">By Wounded Knee we buried them, buried them.<br> The songs we sung, the dreams…<br> Lul-la-by,<br> The white man's lullaby…<br> O race of mine!<br> O brothers mine!  
 <p>    Drum-beat, beat of drums,<br> Pebble-rattle in the gourd,<br> Pulse-beat in the fever…<br> Drum-beat, beat of drums—<br> Famine drank from the gourd bottle, ate the gourd;<br> Left the skin, the bone.<br> She walked the pathway from the east, of the departed—<br> Left me forsaken, alone…<br> Lul-la-by,<br> Tiráwa's long lullaby…<br> O blood of mine!<br> O child of mine!</p>  
 <p>    Drum-beat, beat of drums,<br> Pebble-rattle in the gourd.<br> Still feet in the grave-mound…<br> Drum-beat, beat of drums—<br> The gourd-rattle handle leads to the sun and life;<br> Leaves clay, leaves cold.<br> A purple smoke arises from bowl to float on winds;<br> Leaves ashes—my ash…<br> Lul-la-by,<br> Death's sweet lullaby…<br> O flesh of mine!<br> O hands of mine!</p>  
 <p>    Drum-beat, beat of drums,<br> Pebble-rattle in the gourd,<br> Dream-feet in the yellow line…<br> Drum-beat, beat of drums—</p></div>

 <p>    Drum-beat, beat of drums,<br> Pebble-rattle in the gourd,<br> Calves' feet in starry plains…<br> Drum-beat, beat of drums—<br> A sacred herd graze on tips of fair fresh flowers<br> In garden—Star of Evening's.<br> A bison drinks mixed all-waters, pure<br> From Spring; ’tis hers…<br> Lul-la-by,<br> All-Life's lullaby…<br> O land of mine!<br> O plains of mine!</p>  
 <p>    Drum-beat, beat of drums,<br> Pebble-rattle in the gourd,<br> Dance-feet ’round the sun…<br> Drum-beat, beat of drums—<br> By the sun see the dancing white men with the red—<br> By Wounded Knee, a post!<br> There they blend their songs together, brother-wise;<br> Here the post, the paint…<br> Lul-la-by,<br> The Nation's lullaby…<br> O race of mine!<br> O brothers mine!</p>

 <p>    Drum-beat, beat of drums,<br> Pebble-rattle in the gourd,<br> Soul-feet in trail of wind…<br> Drum-beat, beat of drums—<br> Hear the great sea-feet, beating on the flint-rock!<br> Drum-beat, beat of drum—<br> Hear the beat of distant feet on South Star Trail!<br> Drum-beat, beat of drum—<br> Ti-rá-wa!<br> Earth's great Ti-rá-wa.<br> O heart-beat thine!<br> O drum-beat thine!</p></div>
