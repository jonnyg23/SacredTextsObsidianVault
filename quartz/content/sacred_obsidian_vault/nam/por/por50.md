 <p align="center"><b>TEM-EYOS-KYI</b></p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">    She comes—Tem-Eyos-Kwi—<br> The maiden who has known love!<br> Last Night Love touched her in the house of waiting.<br> Love hid the seeds of life in her garments.<br> In the wind of her walking they are scattered;<br> All the sod will bloom with them!<br> None shall be lost: because of her gladness, the gladness of love known.  
 <p><i>Ah—hi-i! She sees the earth not as we see it—<br> We who were not overtaken by Love in the house of waiting.</i></p>  
 <p>    Wake, women, maidens and wives!<br> Greet Tem-Eyos-Kwi!<br> Greet her with feet dancing,<br> With songs of the heart and lips trembling to silence,<br> Hands that lift their wonder to the breast<br> Yet touch not the flesh.</p>  
 <p>    Wake, sons, lovers, young chiefs, hunters with arrows!<br> Sharpen the darts, make strong, bend the bow;<br> Keen, keen as light, and clear as the wind be your eyes!<br> The women await you in secret places,<br> They have hidden themselves in the leafy shelters:<br> All the green leagues of the forest are ashake with invitation.</p></div>

 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">The quick beating of their hearts is the whisper along the bending grass.<br> The sod grows warm—O men, Summer-dawn is the spirit of the women!  
 <p>They have washed their hearts with prayer,<br> And their bodies with juices of cedar:<br> Perfumed and dried by the wind they have come up from the shore—<br> The great hosts of the women—<br> Unwrapping themselves from the mists of the morning.<br> They have entered the forest with the footfalls of muted music,<br> With light tossing steps like the spray on long beaches.<br> The swinging trees drip dew:<br> With lines of sparkling rain they point the way the women<br> have gone,<br> Leaving all the paths to them open.</p>  
 <p><i>Harken! They follow Tem-Eyos-Kwi, singing:</i></p>  
 <p>    "Come, come, O swift and strong!<br> We are the women: seek us!<br> Our hearts, like little swallows, nest above the secret pools.<br> Oh, say, shall not the winged dart pierce,<br> And the shadow of the bended bow<br> Stir the still, deep pools?<br> Oh, the waters shall sparkle and leap and mingle,<br> And brim at your lips, O men!<br> They shall be poured out and drip upon a chief's feet;<br> They shall fill the hollows of his house with children!<br> Flowing in laughter and whispers and little cries<br> As smoke through the smoke-hole at evening!<br> Ai! ah! ai! Women! Waken the soil with freshets;<br> Bear joy upward as a canoe with sails, swifter than paddles.<br> O men, hunters of life,</p></div>

 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">We are the harborers, the fosterers—the women:<br> Seek us!"  
 <p><i>It was the women, the harborers, the fosterers, who rose first,<br> And followed Tem-Eyos-Kwi:<br> They called to the men.</i></p>  
 <p>    The men go forth like one!<br> Lightning and heat are their weapons, hurled crashing before them.<br> Their hairs, spreading wide, give black wings to the sun,<br> As a cloud filled with eagles blown up from the sea.<br> They enter the forest with the tramp of thunder and the darkness of storm;<br> And the song of the women is stilled.<br> The cry of offering ascends, it passes the swooping shadows;<br> There is a sigh through the forest of winds sinking—<br> Then the hush.</p>  
 <p>    On the leaves is a sweet whisper of rain,<br> Whispered sweetness of pangs past.<br> The warm soil drinks the coolness of tears—<br> Tears that are dropping melodies<br> Because cunning hands and strong have shaken the living cords.<br> The skies part, the black wings fold;<br> The Sun-chief's canoe rides on the upper blue with furled sails:<br> Tem-Eyos-Kwi, laughing, is at the paddle.<br> Our village is drenched with light.<br> (Ei-i! Tem-Eyos-Kwi is glad because Love has overtaken us;<br> Because now we see the earth as she sees it.)<br> Two by two, they come up from the forest—the men and the women.<br> The women's smiles are the little sun-tipped clouds<br> Floating across the face of the mountain:<br> The look in their eyes is deeper than seas.</p></div>

 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">High in the light the men lift their heads.<br> On their clear brows is the mystic mark<br> Of those from whom a great dream has gone forth.<br> Firmly they hold the hands of the women,<br> Who have given peace to their strength, and a meaning.<br> Together, together, the race-makers enter the lodges.</div>
