 <p>(<i>The</i> INCA <i>discovered seated on the tiana. To him enter the</i> UILLAC UMA, <i>in full dress</i>.)</p></dir> </dir>  
 <p>  <i>Tupac Yupanqui</i>. I greet thee, great and noble Priest!<br> Hast thou no news of Rumi-ñaui.<br>   <i>Uillac Uma</i>. Last night, with guards, I wandered out<br> On heights towards Uilcañuta.</p> 
 <p><a name="page_392"><font size="1" color="green">p. 392</font></a></p> 
 <p>Far off I saw a crowd in chains,<br> No doubt the Anti prisoners,<br> For they are all defeated quite.<br> The <i>cacti</i> <a name="fr_67"></a><a href="#fn_67"><font size="1">1</font></a> on the mountains smoke,<br> E'en now the fortress is in flames.<br>   <i>Tupac Yupanqui</i>. And Ollantay, is he taken?<br> Perhaps--I hope his life is saved.<br>   <i>Uillac Uma</i>. Ollantay was among the flames,<br> 'Tis said that no one has escaped.<br>   <i>Tupac Yupanqui</i>. The Sun, my Father, is my shield,<br> I am my father's chosen child.<br> We must subdue the rebel host,<br> For that I am appointed here.</p> 
 <p>(<i>Enter a</i> CHASQUI <i>with a</i> quipu <i>in his hand</i>.)</p> 
 <p>  <i>The Chasqui</i>. This morning at the dawn of day,<br> Rumi-ñaui despatched this <i>quipu</i>.<br>   <i>Tupac Yupanqui</i> (<i>to the</i> Uillac Uma). See what it says.<br>   <i>Uillac Uma</i>. This knot, coloured burnt <i>ahuarancu</i>,<br> Tells us that Tampu too is burnt;<br> This triple knot to which is hung<br> Another which is quintuple,<br> In all of quintuples are three,<br> Denotes that Anti-suyu's thine,<br> Its ruler prisoner of war.<br>   <i>Tupac Yupanqui</i> (<i>to the</i> Chasqui). And thou. Where wert thou?<br>   <i>The Chasqui</i>. Sole King and Lord! Child of the Sun!<br> I am the first to bring the news,<br> That thou mayst trample on the foe,<br> And in thine anger drink their blood.<br>   <i>Tupac Yupanqui</i>. Did I not reiterate commands</p> 
 <p>
 </p> 
 <p><a name="page_393"><font size="1" color="green">p. 393</font></a></p> 
 <p>To spare and not to shed their blood--<br> Not anger but pity is my rule.<br>   <i>The Chasqui</i>. O Lord, we have not shed their blood;<br> They were all captured in the night,<br> Unable to resist our force.<br>   <i>Tupac Yupanqui</i>. Recount to me in full detail<br> The circumstances of the war.</p><dir> <dir>  
 <p>  <i>The Chasqui</i>. For a signal thy warriors wait.<br> The nights passed at Tinquiqueru, <a name="fr_68"></a><a href="#fn_68"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> Concealed in the cavern below,<br> Yanahuara <a name="fr_69"></a><a href="#fn_69"><font size="1">2</font></a> men joining us late.</p> 
 <p>We waited within the large cave,<br> Thy men always ready to fight,<br> Behind foliage well out of sight,<br> Thy warriors patient and brave.</p> 
 <p>But for three long days and dark nights,<br> No food for the zealous and bold;<br> Feeling hungry, thirsty, and cold,<br> We waited and watched for the lights. <a name="fr_70"></a><a href="#fn_70"><font size="1">3</font></a></p> 
 <p>Rumi-ñaui sent orders at length,<br> When the <i>Raymi</i> <a name="fr_71"></a><a href="#fn_71"><font size="1">4</font></a> they carelessly keep,<br> And all of them drunk or asleep,<br> We were then to rush on with our strength.</p> 
 <p>Word came to surprise our foes,<br> Rumi-ñaui had opened the gate,<br> As cautious and silent as fate--<br> We were masters with none to oppose.</p></dir> </dir>

 <p>Those rebels fell into the trap,<br> The arrows came on them like rain,<br> Most died in their sleep without pain,<br> Not knowing their fatal mishap.</p> 
 <p>Ollantay, still trusting, was ta'en,<br> The same Urco Huaranca befell;<br> Hanco Huayllu is captive as well,<br> We thy rebels in fetters detain.</p> 
 <p>The Antis by thousands are slain,<br> A fearful example is made,<br> They are beaten, crushed, and betrayed,<br> Their women in sorrow and pain.</p></dir> </dir>  
 <p>  <i>Tupac Yupanqui</i>. As witness of what has occurred,<br> On Vilcamayu's storied banks,<br> No doubt thou hast told me the truth.<br> It was a well designed attack.</p><dir> <dir>  
 <p>(<i>Enter</i> RUMI-ÑAUI <i>followed by several chiefs</i>.)</p></dir> </dir>  
 <p>  <i>Rumi-ñaui</i>. Great Inca, I kneel at thy feet,<br> This time You will hear my report,<br> I beseech thee to deign to restore<br> The trust that I forfeited once.</p><dir> <dir>  
 <p>(<i>Kneels</i>.)</p></dir> </dir>  
 <p>  <i>Tupac Yupanqui</i>. Rise, great Chief, receive my regard,<br> I accept thy great service with joy;<br> Thou didst cast o'er the waters. thy net,<br> And hast captured a marvellous fish.<br>   <i>Rumi-ñaui</i>. Our enemies perished in crowds,<br> Their chiefs were captured and bound,<br> Overwhelmed by my terrible force,<br> Like a rook detached from the heights.<br>   <i>Tupac Yupanqui</i>. Was much blood shed in the assault?</p> 
 <p><a name="page_395"><font size="1" color="green">p. 395</font></a></p> 
 <p>  <i>Rumi-ñaui</i>. No, Lord, not a drop has been shed,<br> To thine orders I strictly adhered.<br> Those Antis were strangled in sleep,<br> But the fort is entirely razed.<br>   <i>Tupac Yupanqui</i>. Where are the rebels?<br>   <i>Rumi-ñaui</i>. They are waiting with agonised fear,<br> For their fate, to perish by cords.<br> The people are sending up cries,<br> Demanding their deaths without fail.<br> Their women are now in their midst,<br> The children raise hideous cries;<br> It is well that thine order should pass<br> To finish their traitorous lives.<br>   <i>Tupac Yupanqui</i>. It must be so without any doubt,<br> That the orphans may not be alone,<br> Let all perish, not sparing one,<br> Thus Cuzco recovers her peace,<br> Let the traitors be brought before me.<br> In my presence the sentence they'll hear.</p><dir> <dir>  
 <p>(<i>Exit Rumi-ñaui, and re-enter followed by guards in charge of</i> OLLANTAY, URCO HUARANCA, <i>and</i> HANCO HAUYLLU, <i>bound and blindfold, followed by guards with</i> PIQUI CHAQUI <i>bound</i>.)</p></dir> </dir>  
 <p>  <i>Tupac Yupanqui</i>. Take the bands off the eyes of those men.<br> And now, Ollantay, where art thou?<br> And where art thou, O Mountain Chief?<br> Soon thou wilt roll down from the heights.</p><dir> <dir>  
 <p>(<i>To the soldiers who bring in</i> Piqui Chaqui.)</p></dir> </dir>  
 <p>Whom have we here?<br>   <i>Piqui Chaqui</i>. Many fleas in the <i>Yuncas</i> abound,<br> And torment the people full sore,<br> With boiling water they are killed,</p> 
 <p><a name="page_396"><font size="1" color="green">p. 396</font></a></p> 
 <p>And I, poor flea, <a name="fr_72"></a><a href="#fn_72"><font size="1">1</font></a> must also die.<br>   <i>Tupac Yupanqui</i>. Tell me, Hanco Huayllu, tell me,<br> Why art thou Ollantay's man?<br> Did not my father honour thee?<br> Did he not grant thy requests?<br> Did he ever have a secret from thee?<br> Speak also, you, the other rebels,<br> Ollantay and the Mountain Chief.<br>   <i>Ollantay</i>. O father, we have nought to say,<br> Our crimes are overwhelming us.<br>   <i>Tupac Yupanqui</i> (<i>to the</i> Uillac Uma). Pronounce<br> their sentence, great High Priest.<br>   <i>Uillac Uma</i>. The light that fills me from the Sun<br> Brings mercy and pardon to my heart.<br>   <i>Tupac Yupanqui</i>. Now thy sentence, Rumi-ñaui.<br>   <i>Rumi-ñaui</i>. For crimes enormous such as these<br> Death should ever be the doom<br> It is the only way, O King!<br> To warn all others from such guilt.<br> To stout <i>tocarpus</i> <a name="fr_73"></a><a href="#fn_73"><font size="1">2</font></a> they should be<br> Secured and bound with toughest rope,<br> Then should the warriors freely shoot<br> Their arrows until death is caused.<br>   <i>Piqui Chaqui</i>.

Great King, thy sorrowful slave<br> Already had chosen a wife.<br>   <i>Tupac Yupanqui</i>. How is it I know not of this?<br> It should be reported to me.<br> I will load her with suitable gifts;<br> Why was this concealed from my eyes?<br>   <i>Ollantay</i>.

As a magnanimous warrior he may have despised the treacherous methods of Rumi-ñaui. He may have valued Ollantay's known valour and ability, and have been loth to lose his services.
