 <p><a name="fn_60"></a><a href="oll13.htm#fr_60">382:1</a> <i>Intic Huamin Caccunan</i> (<i>Intic Huarminca Caycuna</i>, correct), 'Ye women of the Sun.' Zegarra thought, on the authority of Garcilasso de la Vega, that these could not be select Virgins of the Sun, because the virgins were never allowed outside their convent, and not even women might enter. He is clearly wrong. Much higher authorities than Garcilasso, as regards this point, especially Valera, tell us that the virgins were treated with the greatest honour and respect. They took part in great receptions and festivals, and when they passed along the streets they had a guard of honour.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_61"></a><a href="oll13.htm#fr_61">383:1</a> Rumi. He keeps playing upon his name.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_62"></a><a href="oll13.htm#fr_62">384:1</a> Again playing upon the name of Rumi-ñaui. The High Priest calls for haste, so he substitutes <i>Tunqui</i> for Ñaui (eye), the <i>tunqui</i> (<i>Rupicola Peruviana</i>) being one of the most beautiful birds in the forests.</p>
