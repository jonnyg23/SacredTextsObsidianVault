 Then, 'gainst the larger islands went—<br>
 Or to the southern continent—<br>
  Their warriors strong and bold!<br>
 Famous for valour and for wiles,<br>

 And warlike women guard their isles<br>
  While they were far from home.<br></td></tr>

 But Caribs made a fiercer stand:<br>
 Fighting till death, that for their land<br>
  Invaders dear might pay.<br>
 None thought of yielding—few of flight;<br>
 Then women, maddened with the sight<br>
  Of their brave husbands slain,<br>
 Would rush on pikes and swords—to fight<br>
  The battle o'er again!<br></td></tr>
 
 <tr><td>Meanwhile their race upon the "main"<br>
 Had fought, supremacy to gain.<br>

 We hold the tribes in terror all,<br>
 And lord it over great and small!"<br></td></tr>

 Friendship for English Raleigh felt.<br>
 "A naked race," wrote he, "but I<br>
 Have met none braver 'neath the sky."<br>
  They fought a common foe:<br>
 So on Caronit Corentyn,<br>
 And Essequibo wide between,<br>
  His boats might freely go—<br>
 E'en to white Rupununi's wave:<br>
 For Caribs loved that warrior brave<br>
  Who wrought the Spaniards woe;<br>
 And long they kept the flag he gave,<br>
  That they his ships might know.<a name="page_91_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_91_note_1"><font size="1">1</font></a><br></td></tr>
