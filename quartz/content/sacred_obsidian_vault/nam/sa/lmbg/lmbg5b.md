 <tr><td>"O<small>H</small>, what mean these croaks, like a concert of frogs,<br>
 Such as we, oftentimes, near our marshes and bogs,<br>
  May hear at still evening's close?"<br>

 Levelled at a division of race which prevails,<br>

 <tr><td><h5 align="center">THE LEGEND.</h5></td></tr>
 
 <tr><td>"Come with us, O Bahmoo, to hunt the huge frogs,<br>
 Which are found nowhere else in our rivers and bogs:<br>
 Good food; though in size they approach the bush-hogs:<br>
  Some excellent sport you may find."<br>
 
 
 <!------------------------page 168------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_168"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 168</font></a>
 
 <br>
     Thus our young men addressed<br>
     Their friend Bahmoo, a guest,<br>
 Who had come to their "place" of adventures in quest,<br>
     And, perhaps, of a wife to his mind.<br>
 For, as you may know, our young men often rove<br>
 A long distance in search of a girl they can love.<br></td></tr>
 
 <tr><td>And now these young hunters set forth on their way;<br>
 Each one with his weapons and ornaments gay.<br></td></tr>
 
 <tr><td>"Take a cudgel, O Bahmoo!" said they, "if you go,<br>
 For those creatures are sturdy, and take a hard blow."<br>
     Then answered Bahmoo,<br>
     "I leave weapons to you,<br>
 And tell you beforehand what <i>I</i> mean to do.<br>
     The first frog that is found<br>
     Upon yon marshy ground,<br>
 I will jump on his back, and will twist his neck round,<br>
 And so kill him without more ado!"<br></td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="center">*  *  *  *  *  *  *</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td>Now the chief of those frogs was a spirit, they say,<br>
 Who o'erheard Bahmoo's boast, and forthwith, in the way,<br>
 Full of fun, near the river, he squatted or lay.<br>
 There he seemed half asleep; while around him awoke<br>
 A deafening chorus of croak upon croak.<br></td></tr>
 
 <tr><td>Our young men, well used to it, were not afraid,<br>
 But Bahmoo half shrunk from the row those frogs made,<br>
  It was such a wild hullabaloo.<br>
     As from each monstrous throat<br>
     Pealed the long rolling note;<br>
 
 
 <!------------------------page 169------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_169"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 169</font></a>
 
 <br>
     And he heard it resound,<br>
     Far and near, all around,<br>
  "Boro-ohk," dying off in "boro-oo!"<br></td></tr>
 
 <tr><td>When the boaster looked grave, it was thought a good joker<br>
 And his comrades enjoyed it. Although no one spoke,<br>
  He knew they were laughing aside.<br>
 So he ran at that first frog, and sprang on his back,<br>
 And, to twist round his head, threw his arms round his neck,<br>
  And then—found himself in the tide!<br>
 For the frog-chief, returning his ardent embrace,<br>
 Said," Come, my dear friend, with me, home to my place,<br>
  Just to <i>see</i> it, if not to abide."<br>
     Then he sprang off the ground,<br>
     And with wonderful bound<br>
 And a splash, that was heard a long distance around,<br>
  They plunged in where the deep waters glide.<br></td></tr>
 
 <tr><td>Bahmoo tried to escape, but the frolicsome sprite,<br>
 Which possessed that huge frog, in his paws held him tight;<br>
  And, when they emerged from below,<br>
 He said," Mount on my back, it is much the best way,<br>
 And we will enjoy ourselves this pleasant day,<br>
  As over the river we go.<br>
 We will sing, as we swim along, merry and gay:<br>
 And my people, as chorus, shall join in the lay,<br>
  Each chanting his loud 'boro-oo.'"<br></td></tr>
 
 <tr><td>So each neighbouring frog lifts his head from the tide,<br>
 And the others respond from the banks, far and wide;<br>
     At the voice of their king<br>
     They all merrily sing—<br>
  "Boro-ohk, boro-ohk, boro-oo!"<br></td></tr>

 <br></td></tr>
 
 <tr><td>But meanwhile, Bahmoo's comrades, pray what have they done?<br>
 Well, at first I must say that they thought it no fun:<br>
  To see their friend caught by the frog.<br>
 But as soon as they saw him upon the frog's back,<br>
 With loud peals of laughter, they cried, "Twist his neck,<br>
  And bring him here dead as a log.<br>
     Then, when he is dead,<br>
     And you've done what you said,<br>
 Of all our bold hunters we'll make you the head,<br>
  Our champion in forest and bog!"<br></td></tr>
 
 <tr><td>    'Twas severe, I must own;<br>
     But 'tis very well known,<br>
 That to braggarts <i>who fail</i> little mercy is shown.<br>
 And so Bahmoo, when mocked by the frogs' "boro-oo,"<br>
 Heard his comrades laugh loudly, and join in it too.<br></td></tr>
 
 <tr><td>At length he arrived at the opposite shore;<br>
 The frog had sung merrily all the way o'er<br>
  (Such a jolly old frog none e'er knew).<br>
 "You see I have carried you safely," said he.<br>
 "How pleasant to swim in such good company!"<br>
  Then o'er his head Bahmoo he threw,<br>
 Saying, "Though it be painful to part, I must go,<br>
 For your people are killing mine yonder, I know.<br>
  Adieu, my good Bahmoo, adieu!"<br></td></tr>
 
 <tr><td>He then dived below; the man saw him no more,<br>
 But remained there alone on that desolate shore.<br>

 <br>
 When the young men had finished their frog-hunt, they hailed<br>
 For Bahmoo to swim back; but entreaties all failed<br>
  To draw him from that other side.<br>
 He dreaded their laughter, and would not again<br>
  Adventure himself in the tide,<br>
 Lest that frog he should meet. So he had to remain,<br>
  And there for himself to provide.<br></td></tr>

 "Well, most likely he'd found one ere quitting our side,<br>
     Who would not quite approve<br>
     That the man of her love<br>
 Should be there day and night quite alone.<br>
     She might not have a boat,<br>
     But a 'woodskin' will float,<br>
 Which her woman's wit would most surely provide;<br>
 And, paddling herself, she would be at his side.<br>
  Woman's love greater wonders has done,<br>
     And few things, we find,<br>
     Will deter woman-kind,<br>
 When once it has thoroughly made up its mind,<br>

 <p>The names of those families all descend in the <i>female</i> line, and no individual was permitted to marry another of the same family name.</p>

 <p><a name="page_179_note_1"></a><a href="#page_179_fr_1">1</a> From the above union, the existing Demaréna (Arawâk family) are supposed to have sprung. They bear, of course, their mother's family name; and in ancient days considered it "the correct thing," in accordance with the legend, to intermarry solely with their father's family—the "Korobohána."</p>
 
 <p>These latter have a strange legend of their own. They believe that they originally came from above the clouds. The weight of a heavy woman broke the rope by which they were descending; and communication was thus cut off between those who had reached the ground and those remaining above. The Great Spirit, pitying the latter, supplied them with wings and plumage; and they came down, to colonise the trees above the heads of their brethren—still privileged to live near, and to converse with them, though changed into "Koriouka" <i>parrots</i>.</p>
 
 <p>This legend, though grotesque, affords another instance of the belief (which our pages have shown) expressed by various myths, but almost universal amongst the aboriginal races of Guiana: of a <i>descent</i> from a <i>higher</i> region, or state of existence.</p>

"To-eyborōri" and "To-eyza" are titles, denoting authority, masculine and feminine respectively. The <i>proper names</i> seem to have been lost in the lapse of years.</p>

 <p><a name="page_186_note_1"></a><a href="#page_186_fr_1">1</a> This agrees with the old legends, told to Raleigh and others. But many Indians now say that the male infants were <i>always</i> destroyed, and their fathers warned <i>not to return</i>, on pain of death.</p>
 
 <p>With regard to the subject in general. The expeditions for war and plunder, so common nmongst the South American tribes in former ages, would often draw away all the males in a district capable of bearing arms, and sometimes they <i>never returned</i>. The women, left by themselves,
 
 <!------------------------footnotes page 187------------------------>
 
 <a name="footnotes_page_187"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 187</font></a>
 
 drew together for mutual defence; and being, in those days, all well trained to the bow, would (like the women of the Caribi islands) defend their homes and children fiercely agninst all comers.</p>
 
 <p>Such a state of things—said still to exist in some wild regions of that vast continent—will account for the tales of Orellana and others, of their <i>fights with Amazons</i>.</p>
 
 <p>It does not, of course, account for the murder of husbands, and utter rejection of marital authority, in the legend before us. Whether that tale ever had any foundation in fact, it is impossible to say. Wild and unnatural as it is, it has deeply impressed the minds of the Aborigines; and the writer has, in his researches, come upon various legends (both tragical and comical) founded on the <i>scarcity of wives</i>, after their (supposed) terrible Exodus.</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_187_note_1"></a><a href="#page_187_fr_1">1</a> The spotted "arua" (or harua) of the Arawâks, spelt <i>jaguar</i> by the Spanish discoverers, is commonly called "tiger" by the colonists who frequent the bush. It is called "tobi" by the Waraus, and "kaikusi" by the Caribs and Acawoios.</p>

 <p><a name="page_190_note_1"></a><a href="#page_190_fr_1">1</a> The native ideas respecting the constellations differ widely from ours. For instance, the Southern Cross is supposed, by many clans, to represent a "paui" bird resting on a tree. The star, <i>Beta Centauri</i>, is a hunter stealthily approaching it. <i>Alpha Centauri</i> is the hunter's torch (or firebrand), held <i>behind him</i>, so as not to alarm the bird by its glare. Some call it another hunter, lighting the first. Other constellations have <i>narratives</i> connected with them; of these, "Serikoai," the legend given here, is the most interesting specimen.</p>
