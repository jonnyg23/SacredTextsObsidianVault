The <i>tree</i> itself, the source of all cultivation, is the same in both; and the <i>monkey</i>, though in different ways, releases the pent up waters of the flood.</p>
 
 <p>Though differing widely now, the ancient traditions, as well as the languages spoken by these two nations, and some others, now widely spread, point to a common origin at some remote period.</p>

They were so numerous that food could not be got, so the imposture collapsed under the weight of too great success. The man was not an Indian, and his ultimate object was never known.</p>
 
 <p>To "Capui" (the moon), one of the leading Acawoios, he gave a "commission" as from the Lord. It had a <i>leaden seal</i> attached, and was written in hieroglyphic characters, invented, of course, by himself. Those were the days of "Joe Smith's" early Mormon successes, and our impostor seemed to imitate him as far as he could.</p>
