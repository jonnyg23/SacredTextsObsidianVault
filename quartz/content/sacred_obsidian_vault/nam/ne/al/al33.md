 <p>The following poem on Glooskap may be appropriately placed in this work. The allusion to the agates of Cape Blomidon refers to a tradition given by S. T. Rand, which states that when Glooskap would make his adopted grandmother young again he created the brilliant stones, which are still found at that place, to adorn her. <a name="fr_90"></a><a href="#fn_90"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>

 </p>  <h3 align="center">THE LEGEND OF GLOOSKAP.</h3>  
 <p>Bathed in the sunshine still as of yore<br> Stretches the peaceful Acadian shore;<br> Fertile meadows and fields of grain<br> Smile as they drink the summer rain.</p>  
 <p>There like a sentinel, grim and gray,<br> Blomidon stands at the head of the bay,<br> And the famous Fundy tides, at will,<br> Sweep into Minas Basin still.</p>  
 <p>With wondrous beauty the Gaspereaux<br> Winds its way to the sea below,<br> And the old Acadian Grand Pré<br> Is the home of prosperous men to-day.</p>  
 <p>The place where Basil the blacksmith wrought,<br> In the glow of his forge, is a classic spot,<br> And every summer tourists are seen<br> In the fairy haunts of Evangeline.</p>  
 <p>But the old Acadian woods and shores,<br> Rich in beautiful legend stores,<br> Were once the home of an older race,<br> Who wove their epics with untaught grace.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_138"><font size="1" color="green">p. 138</font></a></p>  
 <p>Long ere the dikes that guard for aye<br> From the merciless tides the old Grand Pré,<br> Built by the Frenchman's tireless hands,<br> Grew round the rich Acadian lands,</p>  
 <p>The Micmac sailed in his birch canoe<br> Over the Basin, calm and blue;<br> Speared the salmon, his heart's desire,<br> Danced and slept by his wigwam fire;</p>  
 <p>Far in the depth of the forest gray<br> Hunted the moose the livelong day,<br> While the mother sang to her Micmac child<br> Songs of the forest, weird and wild.</p>  
 <p>Over the tribe, with jealous eye,<br> Watched the Great Spirit from on high,<br> While on the crest of Blomidon<br> Glooskap, the God-man, dwelt alone.</p>  
 <p>No matter how far his feet might stray<br> From the favorite haunts of his tribe away,<br> Glooskap could hear the Indian's prayer,<br> And send some message of comfort there.</p>  
 <p>Glooskap it was who taught the use<br> Of the bow and the spear, and sent the moose<br> Into the Indian hunter's hands;<br> Glooskap who strewed the shining sands</p>  
 <p>Of the tide-swept beach of the stormy bay<br> With amethysts purple and agates gray,<br> And brought to each newly wedded pair<br> The Great Spirit's benediction fair.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_139"><font size="1" color="green">p. 139</font></a></p>  
 <p>But the white man came, and with ruthless hand<br> Cleared the forests and sowed the land,<br> And drove from their haunts by the sunny shore<br> Micmac and moose, forevermore.</p>  
 <p>And Glooskap, saddened and sore distressed,<br> Took his way to the unknown West,<br> And the Micmac kindled his wigwam fire<br> Far from the grave of his child and his sire;</p>  
 <p>Where now, as he weaves his basket gay,<br> And paddles his birch canoe away,<br> He dreams of the happy time for men<br> When Glooskap shall come to his tribe again.<br>  ARTHUR WENTWORTH EATON</p>
