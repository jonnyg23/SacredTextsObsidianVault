 <p>Áahtu are playing in cedar timber and singing. When through with song they throw their eyes on tree and on again singing song eyes return to their sockets. Coyote comes and asks what they are doing. They tell him that when eyes are not clear and they are thrown away in that manner they become clear again. Coyote says one of his eyes is not clear and he will join them. He throws his eyes on tree with others at last word of song. They sing again and all eyes except those of Coyote return. Little birds all laugh at him and say eyes will not return as he is bad. Coyote is angry and leaves them. He can find nothing to eat and soon dies.</p>
