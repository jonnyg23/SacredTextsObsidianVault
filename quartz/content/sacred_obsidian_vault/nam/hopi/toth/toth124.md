 <p>Bátki clan and Sand clan come from Palátkwapi. When travelling, Sand clan spreads sand on ground and plants corn. Bátki clan causes it to thunder and rain and crops grow in day. They find Bear, Parrot, and Crow clans at Mishóngnovi, and are asked what they know about producing rain crops. They show their power, and their leader is made chief of village. Spring Toríva is very small, but Bátki-ñamu puts in it mud, grass, and water from Little Colorado River and flow of water increases. Bátki is admitted to Antelope and Blue Flute Fraternities of other clans Young Corn-Ear clan comes from Pueblo and brings larger corn.</p>
