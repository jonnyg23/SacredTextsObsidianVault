 <p>Coyote has children somewhere. He hunts for food and kills rabbit. He does not want to eat alone, and calls it out from bluff. From different quarters come different colored Coyotes, and he tells them they will eat together. They tear rabbit to pieces and devour it quickly. That is why Coyote never eats prey alone.</p>
