 <p>Alíksai! At Hohóyapi the people were living. The Coyote had children somewhere. So he was hunting some food for them and had killed a rabbit and he did not want to eat it alone, so he mounted a bluff and called it out in the way Coyotes bark. So from the north tame a yellow Coyote, from the west a blue one, from the south a red one, from the east a white, from the north east a black, and from the south east a gray one. "This here I killed," he said to, them, "and because I do not want to eat it alone I have called you. We shall eat it together." So they tore it to pieces and devoured it there very quickly, and that is the reason why a coyote never eats any prey that he has found alone, but always calls out when he has found something.</p>
