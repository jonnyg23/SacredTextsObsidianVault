 <p>tray to grandmother, and after evening meal they retire, mána sleeping with grandmother. In morning, after making prayer-offerings to dawn and sun, mána shells corn. Young man calls chickens, who eat corn. He tells chickens to sit on banquette and then sings to them, accompanying song with drum. Chickens sway bodies from side to side to time of singing, and so grind corn in bodies. They then vomit meal into tray and leave kiva. Maiden thus saved trouble to grind meal. Young man hunts, and they prepare much food. Grandmother calls neighbors to come and eat. They come, each bringing part of bridal costume. In morning grandmother washes mána's head with yucca suds. Afterwards she dresses mána in bridal costume. Grandmother sprinkles road of meal, and children go to bride's house, where they are welcomed by her mother. Young people live in village, which prospers, as young man is Katcina. Wife goes astray and husband leaves village. People then become poor.</p>
