 <p>Children find nest of Tû'chvos on bluff. Bull-snake has also discovered nest. Snake is discovered by bird, who feels secure and sings jokingly at snake. Snake is angry and tries to climb up. He falls back three times, but fourth .time he reaches mouth of opening in which is nest. He enters, coils up in nest, and devours four little ones. He remains in nest four days and then crawls on bluff and coils up. Old bird flies about bewailing loss of brood. Snake begins to exert charm on bird by strong inhalations. Bird is drawn nearer and nearer towards snake on each inhalation, although when it exhales bird tries to escape. Finally it is drawn by strong inhalation close to Snake's mouth and then snake devours its victim.</p>
