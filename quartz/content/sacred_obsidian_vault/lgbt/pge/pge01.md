 <h1 align="CENTER">PREFACE.</h1>
 <p>THE following treatise on Greek Love was written in the year 1873, when my mind was occupied with my <i>Studies of Greek Poets</i>. I printed ten copies of it privately in 1883. It was only when I read the Terminal Essay appended by Sir Richard Burton to his translation of the <i>Arabian Nights</i> in 1886, that I became aware of M. H. E. Meier's article on <i>Pæderastie</i> (Ersch and Gruber's <i>Encyclopædie</i>, Leipzig, Brockhaus, 1837). My treatise, therefore, is a wholly independent production. This makes Meier's agreement (in Section 7 of his article) with the theory I have set forth in Section X, regarding the North Hellenic origin of Greek Love, and its Dorian character, the more remarkable. That two students, working separately upon the same mass of material, should have arrived at similar conclusions upon this point strongly confirms the probability of the hypothesis.</p>
