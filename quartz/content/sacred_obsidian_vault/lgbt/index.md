 This page indexes resources about LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender)
 issues at sacred-texts.
 This page deals specifically with the subject of LGBT people in sacred texts.
 For an overview of the positions of various religions on this topic,
 including historical and current beliefs,
 refer to <a href="https://www.religioustolerance.org/homosexu.htm">this page at the Ontario Consultants for Religious Tolerance site</a>
 [external site].
 </p>
 
 
 <p>
 References to the scriptures are being used as the backbone
 of much of the heated discussion about gay people
 in a way that has not been seen since the Scopes evolution trial.
 It is thus crucial to examine the actual texts, and the context in which
 they were written.
 This page, which has taken months of research to write,
 provides all available scriptural quotes on this subject,
 with links into the full texts, also available at this site.
 Also included are the <a href="#modern">complete text of several books on the subject</a>,
 scanned specially to provide background information for this page.

 <h3><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h3>
 
 <p>
 The Bible, the Qur'an, and Baha'i and Zoroastrian scriptures
 have a few passages which condemn homosexuality.
 An out of context interpretation of these passages has been used
 as justification for persecution of homosexuals, ranging from
 ridicule, exclusion, and attempts to alter behavior,
 to imprisonment and even execution.
 Typically these quotes are employed not because
 the entire range of scriptural injunctions are being applied consistently,
 but because the power structure needs cherry-picked
 scriptural justification for their actions.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Colonialism subsequently imposed this prejudice on a number of non-western
 societies which did not previously have this sort of persecution. 
 Other major world religions, particularly Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism,
 and Shinto, don't condemn homosexuals in their sacred texts, let alone
 mention the subject except in passing.
 This doesn't mean that societies where these religions are dominant or
 practiced are (or are not) tolerant of LGBT people;
 simply that whatever discrimination
 or persecution may be present is not based on <i>religious</i> grounds.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Modern studies of the nature of gender have found that human sexual
 preference is innate;
 homosexuality occurs in hundreds of species;
 and gender and sexual behavior is a continuum
 rather than two compartmentalized poles.
 Psychologists no longer consider homosexuality a personality
 defect or mental illness.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 There will always be some that prefer not to accept the
 findings of science. 
 For instance, there are a handful of
 Christians who believe that the
 <a href="../earth/index.htm">Earth is flat</a> because the Bible
 refers to the 'four corners of the Earth'. 
 Some literalist Christians reject the
 Copernican solar system for similar scriptural reasons.
 However, many religions, even the most conservative,
 have shown a capability to incorporate advances in knowledge--
 for instance, astronomy, geology and biology--that
 were previously contradicted by, or simply unknown to,
 scripture and religious tradition.
 For instance, modern Roman Catholic doctrine states that
 scientific theories of cosmology, including the 'Big Bang',
 are not incompatible with the concept of a creation by the deity--
 this from the church that only recently lifted its <i>pro forma</i>
 censorship of the works of Galileo.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Values of tolerance and acceptance for others
 can be found at the core of all world religions.
 Many religious groups have not found it difficult to extend
 tolerance to LGBT people, even if this does not
 lead to acceptance within their religion, or sanctioning
 of same-sex unions or homosexual clergy.
 And most religious groups and people, across the spectrum, are
 opposed to violence against gays and other violations
 of their human and civil rights, regardless of their other beliefs
 on the subject.

 <h2>The Ancient World</h2>
 <p>
 The systematic persecution of LGBT people simply did not exist until
 comparatively recently in world history.
 LGBT people played important roles at all levels of classical
 Greek and Roman society.
 Alexander the Great is well-known to have been bisexual.
 The Emperor Hadrian attempted to deify his male life-companion, Antinous.
 In Greek mythology, we have the myth of Tiresias, who changed his gender
 from male to female and back; Zeus, among his other loves, took Ganymede;
 the nymph Hermaphrodite was transformed from a woman into an intersex being.

 She celebrated Aphrodite, the Goddess of Love,

 Through history, her life and works have been a prism through which
 each generation has viewed same-gender love.

 <a name="hinduism"></a>
 <h2>Hinduism</h2> 
 <p>
 In contemporary India LGBT people face discrimination and marginalization.
 This results from cultural attitudes
 imposed by the British during their long occupation of India.
 There is no condemnation of homosexuality in the ancient Hindu texts,
 and no bias against LGBT people is evident up to the 19th century.
 In a few Hindu lawbooks, same-gender sexuality is described as producing
 a state of impurity, but it can be expunged by a ritual bath. 
 </p>
 <p>
 The ancient Hindu attitude was that sexuality should be
 fully integrated into the fabric
 of life, and nothing to be ashamed of.
 For instance, in the
 <a href="../hin/sbe15/sbe15098.htm">Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, IV:4</a>,
 there is a passage about sex magic 
 which was so explicit that Max Müller felt compelled to translate
 it into Latin.</p>
 <p>
 Homosexuality is discussed frankly and without condemnation in the
 ancient Hindu sexual treatises.
 In the Kama Sutra, in <a href="../sex/kama/kama506.htm">Chapter VI</a>,
 lesbianism in harems is described, and in <a href="../sex/kama/kama209.htm">Chapter IX</a>, male and female homosexuality in the context of
 a discussion of oral sex.
 To quote the Kama Sutra, Chapter IX:
 "...in all things connected with love, everybody should act according
 to the custom of his country and his own inclination."
 </p>
 <p>
 There are many accounts of beings who transformed their gender by
 supernatural means in the ancient Hindu epics and Puranas.
 One prominent example occurs in
 <a href="../hin/index.htm#maha">the Mahabharata</a>.
 A transgender person, Sikhandin, plays a pivotal role in that
 ancient Hindu epic. 
 In <a href="../hin/m05/m05191.htm">book 5, Chapter 191-5</a>, the
 origin of Sikhandin is related.
 Sikhandin was born as the daughter of King Drupada of the Panchalas,
 who had previously been childless.
 Druapada begged the God Mahadeva, to give him a son.
 He told him that "Thou shalt have a child who will be a female and male.
 Desist, O king, it will not be otherwise."
 </p>
 <p>
 His wife gives birth to a baby girl, Sikhandin.
 King Drupada conceals the gender of his child and proclaims a male heir has
 been born, and Sikhandin is raised as a boy.
 When Sikhandin comes of age, a marriage is arranged with an unnamed daughter
 of King Hiranyavarman, of the Dasrnakas. Hiranyavarman 
 is described as Drupada's brother.
 The two women are married, "...and the former soon came to know
 that that latter was a women like herself."
 The daughter of King Hiranyavarman sends word back to her father
 about the deception, and he proclaims war as a result:
 "Thou hadst, from folly, solicited my daughter for thy daughter!"
 </p>
 <p>
 At this juncture, Sikhandin flees into the forest, where she encounters
 a Yaksha, a demon, named Sthunakarna.
 Sthunakarna says that he will grant one boon to Sikhandin, who asks
 to become a male, the swap to be temporary until the situation with
 King Hiranyavarman is cleared up.
 So the princess exchanges gender with the demon; and, now a prince,
 returns to the city which the army of King Hiranyavarman is about to besiege.
 King Drupada tells his brother, now truthfully, that Sikhandin is a man,
 and that he can prove it.
 King Hiranyavarman sends "a number of young ladies of great beauty" to
 Sikhandin, and they report back that he is
 "a powerful person of the masculine sex."
 Unfortunately, the demon, now female, is placed under a curse by the
 lord of the Yakshas, and the sex exchange is permanent.
 Sikhandin grows into a mighty warrior.
 </p>
 <p>
 Sikhandin later plays an important role during the cataclysmic battle
 which is the central part of the Mahabharata.
 In the climax of <a href="../hin/m08/index.htm">Book 8</a> of the Mahabharata,
 Bhishma, one of the chief protagonists, is killed because he refuses
 to attack a charge which is led by Sikhandin, because Sikhandin was
 born female.
 This ends up being the turning point in the battle and the war.
 </p>
 <p>
 In this story we see what might, hypothetically,
 be an very old tale of a same-sex union
 woven into the vast epic of the Mahabharata.
 How old may be indicated by the fact that cousins are being married,
 which is typical of tribal societies worldwide.
 In Ancient Egypt women who attained positions of power
 wore male clothing, including
 false beards, in order to formally establish their leadership;
 for such a woman to marry a woman as a political
 maneuver would not be inconceivable.
 </p>
 <p>
 Sikhandin, raised as a boy, is ready and willing to exchange gender
 magically.
 Once having switched to the male gender, he excels at the role,
 and becomes a famous and very skilled warrior.
 Sikhandin is reconciled with his transformed masculine identity,
 despite the fatal display of chivalry by his opponent Bhishma in battle.
 This brings into relief the contradictions of ancient Hindu
 society with regard to gender roles.
 </p>
 <p>
 The story of Sikhandin is the classic hero narrative with a transgender twist.
 </p>
 
 <hr>
 <a name="bible"></a>
 <h2>The Bible</h2> 
 <p>
 There are about half a dozen direct references to
 what we today term homosexuality in the Tanach and NT, and
 a few others which are relevant but not direct.
 Two of the most negative passages are found in the
 book of Leviticus, alongside a mass of ancient Jewish food and incest taboos,
 purification rituals and medical protocols.
 In the New Testament, there are several instances in the Epistles where Paul
 disparages homosexuality.
 <b>Notably, at no point in the Gospel narrative does Jesus
 condemn homosexuality</b>.</p>
 <p>
 Another point to note is that there was no word for homosexuality,
 in the sense that we now use the term, in ancient Hebrew or Greek.
 So the text of the Tanach and NT uses circumlocutions or eumphemisms
 in these passages.
 </p>
 <p>
 As far as lesbianism goes, the Bible is silent.
 There is no explicit mention (or condemnation)
 of female homosexuality in the Tanach,
 and it turns up only once (very tangentially) in the NT.
 </p>
 <h3>The King James Version</h3>
 <p>
 King James I, who commissioned 
 the <a href="../bib/kjv/index.htm">King James Version</a>
 translation, was undoubtedly homosexual.
 It was whispered that "Elizabeth was King: Now James is Queen."</p>
 <p>
 James I was responsible for reaffirming the
 Buggery Act of 1533, which criminalized sodomy in the UK.
 However, James I had several well-documented homosexual relationships.
 Although he had eight children with his wife, Anne of Denmark,
 they eventually decided to live apart.
 In 1607 he met Robert Carr, then age 17, at a joust, and
 had an on-going relationship with him for nearly a decade,
 which ended in a messy breakup.
 In 1614, he started a relationship with
 George Villiers, a commoner, eventually making him Duke
 of Buckingham in 1623.
 In 1624, James wrote Villiers a letter in which he
 asked "whether you loved me now...better than at the time
 I shall never forget at Farham, where the bed's head
 could not be found between the master and his dog."
 </p>
 <h3>Tanach</h3>
 <a name="inthebeginning"></a>
 <h5>In the beginning...</h5>
 <p>
 Some esoteric Jewish traditions
 hold that God is hermaphroditic in nature,
 and that Adam was originally an hermaphrodite.
 This is based on a reading of
 <a href="../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#002">Genesis 1:27</a>:
 "So God created man in his own image, in the image of
 God created he him; male and female created he them."
 This theme is developed with great detail in the Kabbalah;
 For instance see
 <a href="../jud/tku/tku74.htm">this passage from the Kabbalah Unveiled</a>.
 Rabbi Samuel-bar-Nachman is quoted by <a href="itp/itp07.htm#page_73">Carpenter</a> as saying "Adam, when God
 created him, was a man-woman (androgyne)".
 Maimonides (<i>ibid</i>.) is quoted likewise: "Adam and Eve were
 created together, conjoined by their backs."
 This is similar to the 
 <a href="#plato_androgyne">androgyne</a>
 mentioned in Plato's <i>Symposium</i>.
 </p>
 <a name="sodom"></a>
 <h5>The Sin of Sodom</h5>
 <p>
 Then there is the story of the destruction of the city of Sodom,
 (<a href="../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#016">Genesis 18:16-19:29</a>).
 Sodom has given its name to the now somewhat quaint-sounding term 'Sodomy',
 which originally meant a specific male homosexual sex act.
 Eventually it was expanded to mean any form of sexual expression which
 happened to be illegal,
 including things that married heterosexual couples do every day.</p>
 <p>
 However, a close reading reveals the name to be a bit of a misnomer.
 To start off, Sodom is described simply as a 'wicked' place.
 Lot, Abraham's nephew, goes to live there to see
 if even one righteous person can be found there.
 The sexual theme starts when two disguised angels visit Lot.
 A mob, described as consisting of the men of the city, 'both young and old',
 attacks Lot's house and demands that Lot allow
 them to 'know' (in the language of the KJV) the two men.
 To 'know' is, of course,
 the famous KJV circumlocution for having sexual intercourse.</p>
 <p>
 The next passage bears closer examination.
 Lot (<a href="../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#008">Gen 19:8</a>)
 asks the mob to <i>'do' his two virgin daughters instead</i>, but not
 the two guests, 'for ... they came under the shadow of my roof.'
 The rest of the story is well-known:
 divine wrath ensues, the mob is blinded,
 the cities of the plain are destroyed by fire and brimstone while Lot
 and his family flee,
 Lot's wife is turned to a pillar of salt because she looks back,
 and only Lot and his daughters escape.
 In an often ignored coda to this story, Lot's daughters
 have incest with him by getting him intoxicated,
 (<a href="../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#031">Gen 19:31</a>), presumably to
 repopulate the country;
 a similar motif is found in the story of Noah.
 As in other Biblical narratives, even the heroes end up committing
 horrendous sins, driven by circumstances.
 But many ignore the entire context of the story in the rush to
 justify their own bigotry.
 </p>
 <p>
 The sin of the city of Sodom was the originally considered to be
 the violation of the rights of Lot's guests.
 Defining the 'sin of Sodom' to be male homosexuality
 was a later interpretation, which was made by
 medieval Jewish and Christian writers,
 as a reaction to Pagan acceptance of homosexuality.
 Near Eastern hospitality, to this day, implies a responsibility
 to protect guests under one's roof.
 The fact that Lot was ready to make a huge sacrifice by
 offering up his virgin daughters to the mob
 instead of his guests underlines this.
 </p>
 <p>
 There is abundant <i>Haggadah</i>, ancient Jewish folklore, which tells
 of the cruelty of Sodom to strangers,
 and their mistreatment of the poor and homeless.
 Among other stories, travelers are given gold but not
 food; when they starve to death, everything is stolen including
 the gold and the clothes off their backs, and their bodies are left to rot.
 One of Lot's unfortunate daughters is burned to death for the crime
 of giving a starving man food.
 Another woman who assists a poor man is smeared with honey and left to
 be stung to death by bees.
 Some of these stories are suffused with dark comedic twists.
 A poor man is assaulted and robbed.
 Eliezar, a servant of Abraham, is hit on the head when he intervenes.
 A judge rules that he must pay his assailant for medical treatment!
 (Bleeding was considered a surgical procedure).
 Eliezar then hits the judge on the head, drawing blood, and
 tells the <i>judge</i> to pay his fine.

 and <a href="../jud/pol/pol05.htm#page_45">Polano's The Talmud: Selections</a>,
 for many more stories along the same lines.
 After reading these, I guarantee you'll be rooting for the Lord to
 rain down the brimstone on the cities of the plain...
 </p>
 <p>
 There are also numerous Biblical passages warning about mistreating strangers,
 (with the story of Lot being implied),
 for instance this one in the NT:
 "Be not forgetful to entertain strangers:
 for thereby some have entertained angels unawares."
 [<a href="../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#001">Heb. 13:2</a>]
 </p>
 <p>
 Between the original concept of a violation of the law of hospitality
 and the medieval focus on a particular sexual act,
 there is an intermediate stage where Sodom was criticized
 for other reasons entirely.
 Where Sodom is mentioned in later books of the Tanach and in the New Testament,
 it is used as an example of a city which was corrupted by luxury,
 lacking in values such as charity and humility.
 Nowhere is this made clearer than in
 <a href="../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#049">Ezekiel 16:48-50</a>, where
 Ezekiel, speaking for 'the Lord God', enumerates the sins of Sodom:
 "Saith the Lord GOD...Behold, this was the iniquity of ... Sodom,
 pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness ...
 neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. And they were
 haughty and committed abomination before me:
 therefore I took them away as I saw good".</p>
 <p>
 Note that in this context 'abomination' means human sacrifice and idol worship,
 not shared tax breaks for long-term same-sex couples, or sexual
 practices you can see on cable after 10 o'clock.
 Furthermore, 'abomination' is at the end of the laundry list.
 The primary sin of Sodom, by this account, was that their society was
 <b>materialistic, greedy and uncharitable</b>.
 Social and economic justice is a thread that runs through the Hebrew Bible
 and the New Testament alike, and it is not difficult to extrapolate this
 to modern struggles for equality, such as those of LGBT people. 
 <b>When governmental and religious institutions and their leaders
 perpetuate oppression, it would not be farfetched to say that they are
 committing the <i>actual</i> sin of Sodom.</b>
 </p>
 <a name="leviticus"></a>
 <h5>Leviticus</h5>
 <p>
 The book of Leviticus was probably composed during the Babylonian exile,
 from 550 to 500 BCE.
 Leviticus deals with issues of ritual purity and proscribed behavior.
 Traditionally attributed to Moses (it is part of the Pentateuch, the
 first five books of the Bible), Leviticus was probably written by 
 the author modern scholars call 'P'.
 </p>
 <p>
 Now when one hears the word 'Leviticus,'
 a red flag (or yellow card) should go up.
 Wellhausen, in his
 <a href="../bib/cv/phai/index.htm">Prolegomena to the History of Ancient Israel</a> proposed
 the 'Documentary Hypothesis.'
 Among other things, he presented evidence that there were four
 separate authors of the Tanach, the Old Testament.
 In a nutshell, the Levitical laws were added to the text of the
 Bible at a very late date, by an author high in the religious hierarchy,
 a priest (hence the 'P').
 These are the legalisms that Jesus is constantly deprecating in the
 New Testament, and the Talmudic Rabbis delight in picking apart.
 Given the force of divine law by fiat,
 they ruled every aspect of daily life.
 Once the ancient Jewish ritual complex was destroyed,
 many of these laws simply became impossible to follow.
 Others were fossilized prohibitions from the time when 
 Jews were striving to preserve their cultural identity in a sea of paganism.
 </p>
 <p>
 <a href="../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#022">Leviticus 18:22</a> and
 <a href="../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#013">Leviticus 20:13</a>
 are the two Bible verses which are most often cited as support for
 scriptural condemnation of homosexuality; the latter verse
 even demands that such behavior be punished by death.
 Both verses refer specifically to male homosexuality, but not female.
 </p>
 <p>
 There is a condemnation of both male and female cross-dressing in
 <a href="../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#005">Deuteronomy 22:5</a> as 'an abomination'.
 However, no particular punishment is specified.
 By contrast, the same chapter specifies harsh
 punishments for other transgressions:
 death by stoning of
 <a href="../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#013">non-virgin brides [Deu 22:13-21]</a>,
 likewise both participants in an act of
 <a href="../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#022">adultery [Deu. 22:22]</a>,
 and some instances of
 <a href="../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#023">premarital intercourse [Deu. 22:23]</a>.
 </p>
 <p>
 The background of the condemnation of homosexuality in Leviticus is
 a fascinating subject.
 The Jews were in conflict with Pagans who also resided in ancient Palestine.
 There was a lot of pressure for Jews to adopt various practices of the Pagans,
 to become just another religion in the melting pot.
 And so scriptural injunctions were developed which prohibited 
 certain distinctive Pagan beliefs and practices,
 such as tree and stone worship and some forms of divination.
 </p>
 <p>
 Pagan religions of the ancient Near East had male priests who,
 to honor a Goddess figure, emulated women.
 For a late classical description of this belief system,
 refer to <a href="../cla/luc/tsg/index.htm">The Syrian Goddess</a>.
 These priests, called <i>Kedeshim</i> in the Tanach,
 like other <a href="../sha/index.htm">shamans</a> world-wide,
 cross-dressed, took on economic and social roles normally associated with
 females and in some cases even castrated themselves.
 They also enaged in sexual acts as part of their ceremonies,
 similar to the <a href="../tantra/index.htm">Tantric</a> practices.
 This included sex with other men.</p>
 <p>
 In every case where 'Sodomite' is mentioned in the KJV
 outside of the context of the
 story of the downfall of Sodom in Genesis, this is a translation
 of the Hebrew word <a href="../bib/poly/h6945.htm"><i>qâdêsh</i></a>,
 which refers to the before-mentioned pagan priest.
 In fact, <i>qâdêsh</i> is derived from a primitive
 root <a href="../bib/poly/h6942.htm"><i>qâdash</i></a>,
 which means, among other things, 'consecrate, holy, dedicate, purify, sanctify.'
 </p>
 <p>
 For instance, in <a href="../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#014">1 Kings 14:24</a>,
 the KJV has 'there were also sodomites in the land, and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.'
 In addition, abomination in this instance
 could probably be better translated 'idolatry.'
 Using these mistranslated verses to condemn
 homosexuality in general is misleading.
 </p>
 <p>
 The rules against males cross-dressing and having sex
 with other men were based on opposition to this priesthood.
 However, over time it was generalized to similar behavior, regardless of whether
 it was part of a spiritual practice.
 The prohibition of homosexuality in Leviticus was used subsequently
 for hundreds of years as a precedent for the persecution of gays,
 and has been quoted in legal reasoning up to the present day.
 </p>
 <p>
 The book of Leviticus contains
 many harsh commandments and regulations, and much of it can't be reconciled
 with modern life or contemporary standards of justice and human rights.
 Some other points of interest in Leviticus include:</p>
 <dir>
 <li><a href="../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#016">the punishment for blasphemy is death by stoning [Lev 24:16]</a>,<br>
 </li><li><a href="../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#009">likewise, a child who curses their parent will be put to death [Lev 20:9]</a>,<br>
 </li><li><a href="../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#021">locusts, beetles and grasshoppers are permissible food [Lev. 11:21]</a> but not <a href="../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#010">shellfish or mollusks [Lev. 11:10]</a>.<br>
 </li><li><a href="../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#044">Leviticus 25:44-46</a> was construed by slavery apologists to be divine authorization for the buying, holding and bequeathing of human beings as property.
 </li></dir>
 <p>
 Most Christian and Jewish groups today hold that many of the
 rules in Leviticus and elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible
 should not be considered binding, or at worst,
 minor sins if transgressed, and that the harsh punishments are
 obsolete.
 For instance, there is an extensive debate in the Talmud
 (<a href="../jud/t08/t0811.htm">Sanhedrin, Chapter VIII</a>).
 as to whether putting a 'stubbon and rebellious'
 child to death is an appropriate
 punishment by <i>reductio ad adsurdum</i>.
 And Jesus is quoted (<a href="#NT">see below</a>) as saying that the
 law should consist of two rules,
 namely love for God and love for one's neighbor; this is an implicit
 criticism of the complicated and often extreme regulations of Leviticus.
 </p>
 <a name="davidjonathan"></a>
 <h5>David and Jonathan</h5>
 <p>
 There is an extensive and very sympathetic
 description of a same-sex relationship
 in the Bible, the story of David and Jonathan,
 e.g.:
 <a href="../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#001">1 Samuel 18:1-5</a>, 
 <a href="../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#001">1 Samuel 19:1-7</a>,
 <a href="../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#030">1 Samuel 20:30-42</a>,
 <a href="../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#025">2 Samuel 1:25-6</a>.
 While their bond is described as non-sexual,
 it is difficult to characterize it as purely one of friendship.</p>
 <p>
 Jonathan was the son of Saul, David's nemesis.
 Their souls are described as 'knit together'.
 David and Jonathan 'made a covenant, because he loved him
 as his own soul.'
 The word convenant is significant, because
 in the Tanach this word always implies a formal legal agreement.
 To mark this convenant,
 Jonathan literally gives David the clothes off of his back, as well
 as other gifts such as weapons.</p>
 <p>
 Later in the narrative, Jonathan successfully intercedes with
 Saul to spare David's life.
 At their last meeing,
 <a href="../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#030">1 Samuel 20:41</a>,
 they are described as kissing one another and weeping together.
 David's grief at Jonathan's death is profound and moving.
 In Davids lament for Jonathan he describes their friendship
 as '(sur)passing the love of women'.
 This elegy, 
 <a href="../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#018">2 Samuel 1:18-27</a>.
 known as 'the Bow,' is one of the most beloved passages in the Hebrew Bible.
 </p>
 <p>
 This narrative far outweighs the two trivial aspersions against same-sex love
 in Leviticus.
 The bigots who use the Bible to assault gays are apparently blind to it.
 </p>
 <a name="NT"></a>
 <h3>New Testament</h3>
 <h5>The Gospels</h5>
 <p>
 In the four Gospels, Jesus is portrayed throughout with a
 message of love and tolerance.
 Not once does he condemn homosexuals, demand that they be put to death, etc.,
 as do some of his modern followers.
 Such a pronouncement would be a profound departure from the rest of the text.
 For instance, in <a href="../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#037">Matthew 22:37</a>,
 Jesus is quoted as saying:</p>
 <blockquote>
 22:37 ...Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.<br>
 
 22:38 This is the first and great commandment.<br>
 
 22:39 And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.<br>
 
 22:40 On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>And in <a href="../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#034">John 13:34</a>, he is additionally quoted as saying:</p>
 
 <blockquote>
 13:34 A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.<br>
 
 13:35 By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 So Jesus turning around and saying 'Hate Gays' would be a bit out of
 character.
 </p>
 <h5>Paul</h5>
 <p>
 Not so with the disciple Paul.
 In
 <a href="../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#026">Romans 1:26-7</a>
 Paul condemns both male and female homosexuality as 'against nature'
 (hence the term 'unnatural act').
 Notably, this is the sole reference to female homosexuality in the entire
 Bible.
 In
 <a href="../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#009">1 Corinthians 6:9-11</a>
 Paul says that the 'effeminate' shall '(not) inherit the Kingdom of God'.
 In
 <a href="../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#008">1 Timothy 1:8-11</a>
 Paul brands 'those who defile themselves with mankind'
 as criminals, along with thieves and murderers.
 These passages in the Epistles are the only three places where homosexuality is
 mentioned in the NT.
 Scholars consider these passages to be a reaction
 against Near Eastern Pagan, Hellenistic,
 and Roman society, which largely tolerated
 LGBT people and spirituality.
 Later, early Christian writers elaborated on Paul's themes.
 This led to centuries of persecution of LGBT people in Europe, often with
 concealed agendas related to political infighting or outright extortion.
 An early example of this was the Byzantine Emperor Constantine,
 who put in place discriminatory
 laws against homosexuals, and then proceeded to use those laws to
 blackmail and marginalize rivals.
 Refer to the
 <a href="../cla/proc/shp/index.htm">Secret History of Procopius</a>, <i>e.g.</i> <a href="../cla/proc/shp/shp19.htm#page_163">Chapter XVI, p. 163</a>.
 </p>
 
 <a name="gaymarriage"></a>
 <h3>Gay Marriage in the Bible</h3>
 <h4>The Tanach</h4>
 <p>
 Actually this is kind of a trick topic.
 There is no mention of gay marriage in the Bible
 (except, possibly, the
 <a href="#davidjonathan">account of the 'covenant' of David and Jonathan</a>).
 But neither is there any mention of representative democracy,
 electricity, the Internet, or polyester clothing.
 For the vast majority of Christians and Jews 
 (even those that believe in Biblical inerrancy),
 just because something <i>isn't</i> mentioned in the Bible
 doesn't necessarily mean that it is sinful or forbidden.
 Unless you are Amish, of course,
 in which case you probably shouldn't be reading this in the first place...
 </p>
 <p>
 The Bible is a smorgasbord
 for those who need just one out-of-context quote to justify their
 personal views on marriage.
 Depending on which pinhole you look through, the Bible
 can be cited as both approving or forbidding polygamy, monogamy,
 divorce, and lifelong celibacy. 
 So it is no wonder that there are quotes that can be manipulated
 in the same way to condemn gay marriage.
 For instance, the often quoted <a href="../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#023">Genesis 2:23-4</a>:
 
 </p><dir>
 <p>
 2:23 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.</p>
 
 <p>
 2:24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.</p>
 
 </dir>
 
 <p>
 Now before you say, "Aha! so the Bible does forbid gay marriage!",
 take another look,
 This passage does <i>not</i> say &amp;quot'Thou shalt not let two men or two women
 get married, and get the same tax breaks and hospital visitation rights
 as heterosexuals."
 When a commandment or injunction occurs in the Bible
 it is stated explicitly, as throughout <a href="#leviticus">Leviticus</a>.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 This passage also has <a href="#inthebeginning">mystical overtones</a>
 which literalists are apt to completely miss or ignore.
 It implies that Adam was at one time united with Eve in the same body,
 and the reason that people seek companionship is because they
 are searching for their missing half.
 (This is similar to Plato's
 <a href="#plato_androgyne">theory of the androgyne</a>).
 Also, both in the Tanach and the NT,
 <b>marriage is used as a metaphor for the union of the soul with God</b>,
 which is obviously binary.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 In the Tanach, marriage practises such as bigamy, polygamy, concubinage,
 arranged and levitrate marriages
 are described as normal, as in fact they were at the time.
 All of these types of marriage are today either illegal
 in most western countries or
 considered highly unusual, much more so than monogamous same sex unions.
 </p>
 
 <dir>
 <li>In <a href="../bib/kjv/gen016.htm">Genesis 16</a> Sarah,
 Abraham's wife, encourages Abraham to impregnate her handmaid, Hagar,
 because she is barren (although Sarah miraculously later gives birth to Isaac).
 Later (<a href="../bib/kjv/gen025.htm">Genesis 25</a>) Abraham takes yet another
 wife, Keturah, who is also described as a concubine.
 
 <img src="img/bfvnote.jpg" align="RIGHT" alt="Jacob, Rachel and Leah: family tree">
 </li><li>In <a href="../bib/kjv/gen029.htm">Genesis 29</a> Jacob marries 
 the sisters Rachel and Leah, who are the daughters of Laban, his maternal uncle.
 In the <a href="../bib/kjv/gen030.htm">next chapter</a>,
 Jacob has two sons by Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid,
 two sons by Zilpah, Leah's handmaid,
 then two sons by Leah, and finally Rachel bears Joseph.
 
 </li><li>Six wives of David are named in
 <a href="../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#002">2 Sam. 3:2</a>.
 
 </li><li>Solomon is described as having <a href="../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm">seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines</a>.
 However, the Talmud (<a href="../jud/t08/t0805.htm#page_54">Tractate Sanhedrin</a>) states that a king may have no more than eighteen wives.
 </li></dir>
 
 <p>
 Note that out of all of these arrangements, only marrying two sisters
 is explicitly forbidden in <a href="../bib/kjv/lev018.htm">Leviticus 18</a>;
 however it is permitted to <a href="../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#018">marry a deceased wife's sister</a>.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 So it is absolutely disingenuous to speak of
 'traditional marriage' (as a codeword for heterosexual monogamy) as biblical.
 It is even more absurd when this concept is uttered by members of the clergy,
 who really should know better.
 </p>
 
 <h4>The New Testament</h4>
 
 <p>
 However, in at least one passage in the NT, marriage is defined as monogamous.
 In <a href="../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#002">Mark 10:2-12</a>), Jesus is quoted as saying:
 </p>
 <dir>
 
 <p>
 10:2 And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife? tempting him.</p>
 
 <p>
 10:3 And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command you? </p>
 
 <p>
 10:4 And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put her away. </p>
 
 <p>
 10:5 And Jesus answered and said unto them, For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept. </p>
 
 <p>
 10:6 But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female. </p>
 
 <p>
 10:7 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife; </p>
 
 <p>
 10:8 And they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more twain, but one flesh. </p>
 
 <p>
 10:9 What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder. </p>
 
 <p>
 10:10 And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter. </p>
 
 <p>
 10:11 And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her. </p>
 
 <p>
 10:12 And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery.</p>
 </dir>
 
 <p>
 One reader commented that this passage proves that Jesus
 "hated [gays]".
 but I'm not sure how he came away with that conclusion.
 If you take this at face value,
 it says that remarriage after divorce is equivalent to adultery.
 The passage 10:6-9 is just a restatement of the passage from Genesis,
 leading up to the conclusion 'let no man put asunder'.
 In 10:10-12, Jesus explains the concept again, <i>just in case we
 missed the point the first time around</i>.
 As usual, the language attributed to Jesus is very specific and
 transparent.
 </p>
 
 <p>Also of interest is <a href="../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001">1 Timothy 4:1</a>:
 
 </p><dir>
 <p>
 4:1 Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;</p>
 <p>
 4:2 Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;</p>
 
 <p>
 4:3 Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth </p>
 
 <p>
 4:4 For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:</p>
 
 <p>
 4:5 For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.</p>
 </dir>
 
 <p>
 Here Paul disapproves of the prohibition of marriage,
 as well as the practise of vegetarianism.
 This is probably a reference to
 a <a href="../gno/index.htm">Gnostic</a> group,
 some of whom were vegetarians.
 A few Gnostics and early Christians were opposed
 to marriage in <b>any</b> form (including monogamous, heterosexual marriage).
 Marriage was considered a grave sin by some of the
 <a href="../chr/ecf/index.htm">early Church fathers</a>,
 and the only way into the kingdom
 of heaven to be the lifelong mortification of the flesh.
 This passage by Paul from the Epistles weighs
 in against this particular concept.
 On the other hand, some Gnostics and early Christians
 practiced group marriage,
 taking 'holding all things in common' to the extreme.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 One wonders about Paul's condemnation of vegetarians.
 Will some future US President float a constitutional ammendment mandating that
 vegetarians eat meat?
 Will conservative Christians organize abusive demonstrations at
 health food stores?
 <i>Does God hate tofu?</i>
 </p>
 
 <p>
 The sanctioned form of marriage in Judaism and Christianity
 has continued to evolve over the centuries.
 Policies on divorce have varied widely.
 There was a liturgy for same sex unions in one branch
 of the Eastern Orthodox church.
 During the Middle Ages and well into the
 renaissance, the vast majority of European marriages were 'common-law,'
 and had no religious sanction:
 church weddings were far too expensive for most people.
 Mormons originally practised polygamy, although they ceased
 that as a condition for Utah statehood.
 Today, same sex unions are consecrated in some
 liberal Jewish and Christian denominations.
 </p><p>
 </p>
 In general, society has changed the definition of marriage widely,
 and religion has followed by sanctioning it.
 <p>
 Some interpret the passages above to imply
 condemnation of gay marriage, or to justify their
 prejudices against LGBT people.
 The reader is encouraged to look at the entire context and
 make up their own mind.
 </p>
 <hr>
 
 
 <a name="quran"></a>
 <h2>The Qur'an</h2>
 <p>
 Male homosexuality is only implied in the Qur'an, and
 there is no mention of lesbians or transexuals.</p>
 <p>
 The story of Lot is repeated numerous times (e.g.,
 <a href="../isl/quran/02609.htm#026:165">26:165-6</a>,
 <a href="../isl/quran/02704.htm#027:055">27:55</a>,
 and
 <a href="../isl/quran/02903.htm#029:028">29:28-9</a>).
 </p>
 <p>
 The <a href="../isl/quran/02609.htm#026:165">Yusuf Ali translation
 of 26:165</a> runs:
 "Of all creatures in the world will ye approach males, and
 leave those whom God has created to be your mates, Nay ye are a people
 transgressing all limits"
 </p>
 The <a href="../isl/sbe09/027.htm#page_104">Palmer translation of 27:55</a>
 is: "And Lot ... said to his people:
 'Do ye approach an abominable sin while ye can see?
 do ye indeed approach men lustfully rather than women? nay! ye are
 a people who are ignorant.'"
 
 <p>
 These passages reflect the post-classical Jewish and Christian
 interpretation of the Sodom narrative,
 as well as Aristotle's widely accepted (but incorrect)
 view that animals do not engage in homosexual acts. 
 </p>
 <p>
 In context, the Qur'an mentions other cities which
 were destroyed, not just Sodom; including the legendary
 cities of 'Ad and Thamud.
 These have much different narratives.
 For instance, in Thamud "there were in the city nine persons
 who despoiled the land and did not right." (<a href="../isl/sbe09/027.htm#page_104">27:49</a>).
 In <a href="../isl/sbe06/011.htm#page_208">Surah 11</a>
 a parallel is drawn between
 the story of Lot and the Biblical flood narrative of Noah.
 This is a constant theme that runs throughout the Qur'an.
 It draws freely from Biblical, Talmundic and traditional Arabic lore
 of civilizations overwhelmed by catastrophes brought on by hubris.
 </p>
 <p>
 The common motif of these stories is that the people of these cities
 defy God, and ignore his prophets;
 not that they engage in particular sexual practices.
 God is warning, through the Qur'an, that He
 is the creator and destroyer of all things.
 This is a much larger concern, on a cosmic scale,
 than what people do in their bedrooms.
 </p>
 <p>
 There is a <i>possible</i> mention of male homosexuality in
 Surah 4:16.
 <a href="../isl/quran/00403.htm#004:016">Yusuf Ali translates this as:</a>.
 "If two men among you
 are guilty of lewdness, punish them both. If they repent and amend,
 <i>Leave them alone</i>; for God is oft-returning, Most Merciful"
 (emphasis inserted).
 <a href="../isl/sbe06/004.htm#page_74">Palmer's translation of the
 same passage is</a>:
 "And if two of you commit [adultery],
 then hurt them both; but if they turn again and amend, leave them
 alone, verily God is easily turned, compassionate".
 (Adultery is implied from the previous paragraph).
 <a href="../isl/sbe06/004.htm#fn_174">Palmer notes</a>:
 "the commentators are not agreed as to the nature of the
 offence here referred to.
 The punishment to be inflicted is also the subject of dispute." 
 This stands out here, because
 this Surah (The Women) codifies a number
 of laws and regulations about sexual behavior,
 and in each case <i>except for this</i>,
 the text lays out specific punishments. 
 </p>
 <p>
 There is also a cryptic passage in <a href="../isl/sbe09/076.htm#page_313">Surah 76</a>:
 one of the rewards in Paradise is described as
 "eternal boys...[like] scattered pearls...and when
 thou seest them thou shalt see pleasure and a great estate."
 (Palmer).
 Whether these are supposed to simply be attendants or companions
 is left to the imagination.
 </p>
 <p>
 There is, however, explicit condemnation of homosexuality in the
 Hadith, which are traditional sayings from early Islam which have
 acquired legal status.
 For instance, Williams in his anthology <cite>Islam</cite>, quotes
 the following Hadith (<a href="../isl/isl/isl13.htm#page_83">p. 83</a>):
 Bukhārī . . . from Ibn ‘Abbās:
 "The Prophet cursed men who act like women and women who act like men,
 and said, 'Drive them from your houses.'
 He expelled such people, and ‘Umar did it as well."
 </p>
 <p>
 Islamic societies through history have both tolerated
 and persecuted LGBT people, sometimes at the same time.
 However, there is very little in the core text of Islam, the Qur'an, which
 support the harsh punishments and ostracism which gays are
 subjected to in contemporary Islamic society, and the relevant passages
 are either vague or tangential.
