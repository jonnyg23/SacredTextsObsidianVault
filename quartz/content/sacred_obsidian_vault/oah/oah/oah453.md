 <p>1. PRAISE ye the Almighty for Abraham and Brahma and Po. And their followers that plodded along in the dark days.</p>
 <p>2. Praise ye the Supreme Being, ye followers of them, ye line of the Light of the Great Spirit.</p>
 <p>3. To glorify the Creator in after generations, by the wisdom of His choice, Who rose up great harvests in Vind'yu and Egupt and Chine'ya.</p>
 <p>4. Sing in his praise forever, the Creator, the Almighty. Shout long and loud in the glory of Jehovih, Fashioner of mighty peoples.</p>
