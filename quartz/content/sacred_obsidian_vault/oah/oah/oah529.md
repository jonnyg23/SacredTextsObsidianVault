 <h3 align="CENTER">Chapter XLVI</h3>
 <font size="2"><p align="CENTER">SATAN ENTERETH THE HOLY COUNCIL OF HAPSENDI, AND SPEAKETH UNTO LOOEAMONG, THE TRIUNE</p></font>.
 <p>1. HEAR me, O thou most upright of Gods. Mine is a tale of pity and of horrors for thy people.</p>
 <p>2. Behold, thy one-time brother Triunes have had great advantage of thee from the start.</p>
 <p>3. They had more populous kingdoms and subjects of higher grades.</p>
 <p>4. Nevertheless, wherein they have prospered thou shalt be wise.</p>
 <p>5. They also found it necessary to have a name, that mortals could call unto.</p>
 <p>6. And they took upon themselves the names, Brahma and Budha, both of which signify knowledge, no more nor less.</p>
 <p>7. This hath satisfied mortals.</p>
 <p>8. Now, thou shalt chose the name, Kriste, which is the Ahamic word for knowledge also.</p>
 <p>9. In this, then, thou shalt have truth on thy side in heaven before thy Holy Council, and on earth thou shalt have a personal embodiment.</p>
