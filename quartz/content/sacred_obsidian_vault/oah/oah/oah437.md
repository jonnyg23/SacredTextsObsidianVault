 <h3 align="CENTER">CHAMBER OF PROPHECY</h3>
 <p>1. GOD said: Before learning to approach the foot of the throne, what profit is it to show them the way to mount upon the throne itself?</p>
 <p>2. Preserve, therefore, the secrets of prophecy for such as apply themselves to keeping Jehovih's commandments. Those who have attained to the foot, can of themselves find the way to mount upon it.</p>
