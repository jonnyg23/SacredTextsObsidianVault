 <p align="CENTER">TO ATTACH A DOG TO A PERSON, PROVIDED NOTHING ELSE WAS USED BEFORE TO EFFECT IT.</p> 
 <p>Try to draw some of your blood, and let the dog eat it along with his food, and he will stay with you. Or scrape the four corners of your table while you are eating, and continue to eat with the same knife after having scraped the corners of the table. Let the dog eat those scrapings, and he will stay with you.</p>
