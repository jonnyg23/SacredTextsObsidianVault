 </i><p>A good Remedy for Worms, to be used for men as well as for Cattle:</p><dir> <dir>  
 <p>Mary, God's Mother, traversed the land,<br> Holding three worms close in her hand;<br> One was white, the other was black, the third was red.</p></dir> </dir>  
 <p>This must be repeated three times, at the same time stroking the person or animal with the hand; and at the end of each application strike the back of the person or the animal, to wit: at the first application once, at the second application twice, and at the third application three times; and then set the worms a certain time, but not less than three minutes.</p>
