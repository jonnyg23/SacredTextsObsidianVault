 <p> <b>First Point.</b> First: Christ called His beloved Disciples and gave them power to cast out the demons from human bodies and to cure all the diseases.
 </p><p> <b>Second Point.</b> Second: He teaches them of prudence and patience: "`Behold, I send you as sheep in the midst of wolves. Be ye therefore wise as serpents and simple as doves.'"
 </p><p> <b>Third Point.</b> Third: He gives them the way to go. "`Do not want to possess gold nor silver: what you have freely received, freely give.'" And He gave them matter to preach. "`Going you shall preach, saying: `The Kingdom of Heaven has approached.'"
