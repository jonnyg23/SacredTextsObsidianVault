It is to be noted in all the following Mysteries, that all the words which are inclosed in parentheses <a name="fr_22"></a><a href="seil83.htm#fn_22"><font size="1">23</font></a> are from the Gospel itself and not those which are outside.
 <p> And in each Mystery, for the most part, three Points will be found to meditate and contemplate on with greater ease.  <a></a> </p><h3 align="center">OF THE ANNUNCIATION OF OUR LADY</h3> St. Luke writes in the first Chapter [26-39].
 <p> <b>First Point</b>. The first Point is that the Angel St. Gabriel, saluting Our Lady, announced to her the Conception of Christ our Lord. "The Angel entering where Mary was, saluted her saying: `Hail full of grace. Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and shalt bring forth a son.'"
 </p><p> <b>Second Point</b>. The second, the Angel confirms what he said to Our Lady, telling of the conception of St. John Baptist, saying to her: "`And behold thy cousin Elizabeth hath conceived a son in her old age.'"
 </p><p> <b>Third Point</b>. The third, Our Lady answered the Angel: "`Behold the handmaid of the Lord: be it done to me according to thy word!'"
