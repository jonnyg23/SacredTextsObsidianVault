 <p> <b>First Point.</b> First: After being baptized, He went to the Desert, where He fasted forty days and forty nights.
 </p><p> <b>Second Point.</b> Second: He was tempted by the enemy three times. "The tempter coming to Him said to Him: `If Thou be the Son of God, say that these stones be turned into bread.' `Cast Thyself down from here.' `If prostrate on the earth Thou wilt adore me, I will give Thee all this which Thou seest.'"
 </p><p> <b>Third Point.</b> Third: "The Angels came and ministered to Him."
