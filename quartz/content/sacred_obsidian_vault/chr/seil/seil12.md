Let the Preparatory Prayer be the same.
 <p> <b>First Prelude</b>. The First Prelude will be the same composition.
 </p><p> <b>Second Prelude</b>. The second is to ask for what I want. It will be here to beg a great and intense sorrow and tears for my sins.
 </p><p> <b>First Point</b>. The first Point is the statement of the sins; that is to say, to bring to memory all the sins of life, looking from year to year, or from period to period. For this three things are helpful: first, to look at the place and the house where I have lived; second, the relations I have had with others; third, the occupation in which I have lived.
 </p><p> <b>Second Point</b>. The second, to weigh the sins, looking at the foulness and the malice which any mortal sin committed has in it, even supposing it were not forbidden.
 </p><p> <b>Third Point</b>. The third, to look at who I am, lessening myself by examples: 
 </p><p> First, how much I am in comparison to all men;
 </p><p> Second, what men are in comparison to all the Angels and Saints of Paradise;
 </p><p> Third, what all Creation is in comparison to God: (--Then I alone, what can I be?)
 </p><p> Fourth, to see all my bodily corruption and foulness;
 </p><p> Fifth, to look at myself as a sore and ulcer, from which have sprung so many sins and so many iniquities and so very vile poison.
 </p><p> <b>Fourth Point</b>. The fourth, to consider what God is, against Whom I have sinned, according to His attributes; comparing them with their contraries in me -- His Wisdom with my ignorance; His Omnipotence with my weakness; His Justice with my iniquity; His Goodness with my malice.
 </p><p> <b>Fifth Point</b>. The fifth, an exclamation of wonder with deep feeling, going through all creatures, how they have left me in life and preserved me in it; the Angels, how, though they are the sword of the Divine Justice, they have endured me, and guarded me, and prayed for me; the Saints, how they have been engaged in interceding and praying for me; and the heavens, sun, moon, stars, and elements, fruits, birds, fishes and animals -- and the earth, how it has not opened to swallow me up, creating new Hells for me to suffer in them forever!
 </p><p> <b>Colloquy</b>. Let me finish with a Colloquy of mercy, pondering and giving thanks to God our Lord that He has given me life up to now, proposing amendment, with His grace, for the future.
 </p><p> OUR FATHER.
