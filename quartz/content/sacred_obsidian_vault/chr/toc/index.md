 Could Jesus have gotten off on a technicality?
 Mr. Breed, a Missouri attorney, presents the brief for acquittal, and then
 withdraws his plea--on the basis that Jesus is fulfilling an ancient prophecy,
 and must die anyway, to save mankind.
 </p>
 <p>
 He points out major discrepancies between Jewish and Roman legal procedures
 and the gospel accounts.
 For instance, the Sanhedrin, the Jewish supreme court, would never have
 met on the Sabbath, nor condemned a man to death on
 the same day as his trial.
 Roman law also gave defendants many rights we now take for granted, such
 as the right to a public trial, and to cross-examine witnesses, which
 were not followed either.
 </p>
 <p>
 Why care about this, the ultimate moot point?
 In particular, the actions of the Sanhedrin in the Gospel narratives
 were used to inflame anti-Semitism for centuries.
 This toxic stereotype seeped into every aspect of the
 Jewish-Christian relationship.
 (see <a href="../../jud/rio/index.htm">this book</a>).
 While Mr. Breed does not address this issue directly,
 it is implicit in his thesis.
 </p>
 <p>
 Some will say that Breed's conclusion is undermined by his evidence.
 However, this book demonstrates that a devout Christian can
 use Biblical criticism to reinforce their faith, and even renew it.
 Whether you believe that Jesus was completely historical, or a fable
 based on ancient memes of a dying god, this book will
 provide much food for thought.
