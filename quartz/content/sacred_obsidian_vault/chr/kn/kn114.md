 <p>   And the Tabernacle of the Law of God, the Holy <small>ZION</small>, shall remain here until that day when our Lord shall dwell on Mount <small>ZION</small>; and <small>ZION</small> shall come and shall appear unto all prepared, with three seals—even as <small>MOSES</small> gave her—as it saith in the Old Law and in the New, "At the testimony of two or three [witnesses] everything shall stand."<a name="page_223_fr_2"></a><a href="#page_223_note_2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></a> And then, saith <small>ISAIAH</small> the Prophet, "The dead shall be raised up, and those who are in the graves shall live, for the dew which [cometh] from Thee is their life."<a name="page_223_fr_3"></a><a href="#page_223_note_3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></a> And when the dead are raised up, His mercy whereby He watereth the earth shall cease; they shall stand up before Him with the works which they have done. And <small>ENOCH</small> and <small>ELIAS</small> shall come, being alive, so that they may testify, and <small>MOSES</small> and <small>AARON</small> from the dead shall live with everyone. And they shall open the things that fetter her (i.e., <small>ZION</small>), and they shall make to be seen the <small>JEWS</small>, the

 crucifiers, and they shall punish them and chide them because of all that they have done in perverting the Word of God. And the <small>JEWS</small> shall see what He wrote for them with His hand—the Words of His Commandment, and the manna wherewith He fed them without toil [on their part], and the measure thereof; the <small>GÔMÔR</small>, and the spiritual <small>ZION</small>, which came down for their salvation, and the rod of <small>AARON</small>, which blossomed after the manner of <small>MARY</small>.</p>
