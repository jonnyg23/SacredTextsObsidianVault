 <p>   And now I will tell you how he died. His days were sixty [years], when a sickness attacked him. And his days were not as the days of <small>DAVID</small> his father, but they were twenty [years] shorter than his, because he was under the sway of women and worshipped idols. And the angel of death came and smote him [in] the foot, and he wept and said, "O Lord God of <small>ISRAEL</small>, I am conquered by the terrestrial law, for there is no one free from blemish before Thee, O Lord, and there is no one righteous and wise before Thee, O Lord. For Thou dost scrutinize and try the heart. Nothing is hidden from Thee. Thou lookest upon the hidden things [as if they were] revealed, and Thou searchest out the heart. Have mercy upon me, Lord. Thou examinest the heart of man and dost try the reins. Have mercy upon me, Lord. Thou hearest both the whisper and the thunderclap. Have mercy upon me, Lord. And if Thou hast mercy upon the righteous who have not transgressed Thy commandments, what is there wonderful in Thy mercy? Have mercy upon me, Lord. But if Thou shouldest show mercy upon me, a sinner, Thy mercy would be a marvellous and gracious thing. Have mercy upon me, Lord. And although I have sinned remember <small>ABRAHAM</small>, and <small>ISAAC</small>, and <small>JACOB</small>, my fathers who did not transgress Thy commandment. Have mercy upon me, Lord, for Thou art merciful and forgiving; for the sake of <small>DAVID</small> Thy servant have

 mercy upon me, Lord. O Master of the world, and of kings and governors, have mercy upon me, Lord. O Thou who makest fools to be wise, and the wise to be fools, have mercy upon me, Lord. O Turner of sinners and Rewarder of the righteous, have mercy upon me, Lord." And as he spake these words tears streamed down his face, and he searched for his napkin.</p>
 
 <p>   And the Angel of God went down to him and said unto him, "Hearken thou unto what I shall say unto thee, for the sake of which God hath sent me. From being a wise man thou hast turned thyself into a fool, and from being a rich man thou hast turned thyself into a poor man, and from being a king thou hast turned thyself into a man of no account, through transgressing the commandment of God. And the beginning of thy evil was the taking of many wives by thee, for through this thou didst transgress His Law, and His decree, and the ordinance of God which <small>MOSES</small> wrote and gave to you, to <small>ISRAEL</small>, that ye should not marry wives from alien peoples but only from your kinsfolk and the house of your fathers, that your seed might be pure and holy and that God might dwell with you. But thou didst hold lightly the Law of God, thinking that thou wast wiser than God, and that thou wouldst get very many male children. But the foolishness of God is wiser than the wisdom of men, and He hath only given thee three sons: the one who carried off thy glory into an alien land, and made the habitation of God to be in <small>ETHIOPIA</small>; the one who is lame of foot, who shall sit upon thy throne for the people of <small>ISRAEL</small>, the son of the kin of thy kin from <small>TARBÂNA</small>, of the house of <small>JUDAH</small>; and the one who is the son of a Greek woman, a handmaiden, who in the last days shall destroy <small>REHOBOAM</small> and all thy kin of <small>ISRAEL</small>; and this land shall be his because he believeth in Him that shall come, the Saviour. And the tribe of <small>REHOBOAM</small>, and those who are left of <small>ISRAEL</small>, shall crucify Him that shall come, the

 Redeemer, and the memory of you shall be blotted out from the earth. For they shall think out a plan which they shall not be able to establish, and He will be wroth with them and blot out the memorial of them.</p>
 
 <p>   "And as for thee, <small>JOSEPH</small>, the son of <small>JACOB</small>, shall be a symbol of thee. For his brethren sold him into the land of <small>EGYPT</small> from <small>SYRIA</small>, the country of <small>LÂBÂ</small> (<small>LABAN</small>), and on his going down into the land of <small>EGYPT</small> there arose a famine in <small>SYRIA</small> and in all the world. And through his going down he called his kinsfolk and delivered them from famine and gave them a habitation in the land of <small>EGYPT</small>, the name whereof is <small>GÊSHÊN</small> (<small>GOSHEN</small>). For he himself was King under <small>PHARAOH</small>, King of <small>EGYPT</small>. Similarly the Saviour Who shall come from thy seed shall set thee free by His coming, and shall bring thee out of <small>SHEÔL</small>, where until the Saviour cometh thou shalt suffer pain, together with thy fathers; and He will bring thee forth. For from thy seed shall come forth a Saviour Who shall deliver thee, thee and those who were before thee, and those who shall [come] after thee, from <small>ADAM</small> to His coming in the kin of your kin, and He shall make thee to go forth from <small>SHEÔL</small> as <small>JOSEPH</small> brought out his kinsfolk from the famine, that is to say the first <small>SHEÔL</small> in the land of famine, so also shall the Saviour bring out of <small>SHEÔL</small> you who are His kinsfolk. And as afterwards the <small>EGYPTIANS</small> made [the kinsmen of <small>JOSEPH</small>] slaves, so also have the devils made you slaves through the error of idols.</p>
 
 <p>   "And as <small>MOSES</small> brought his kinsmen out of the servitude [of <small>EGYPT</small>], so shall the Saviour bring you out of the servitude of <small>SHEÔL</small>. And as <small>MOSES</small> wrought ten miracles and punishments (or, plagues) before <small>PHARAOH</small> the King, so the Saviour Who shall come from thy seed shall work ten miracles for life before thy people. And as <small>MOSES</small>, after he had wrought the miracles, smote the sea and made the people to pass over as it were on dry

 land, so the Saviour Who shall come shall overthrow the walls of <small>SHEÔL</small> and bring thee out. And as <small>MOSES</small> drowned <small>PHARAOH</small> with the <small>EGYPTIANS</small> in the Sea of <small>ERITREA</small>, so also shall the Saviour drown <small>SATAN</small> and his devils in <small>SHEÔL</small>; for the sea is to be interpreted by <small>SHEÔL</small>, and <small>PHARAOH</small> by <small>SATAN</small>, and his hosts of <small>EGYPTIANS</small> by devils. And as <small>MOSES</small> fed them [with] manna in the desert without toil, so shall the Saviour feed you with the food of the Garden (i.e., Paradise) for ever, after He hath brought you out from <small>SHEÔL</small>. And as <small>MOSES</small> made them to dwell in the desert for forty years, without their apparel becoming worn out, or the soles of their feet becoming torn, so the Saviour shall make you to dwell without toil after the Resurrection. And as <small>JOSHUA</small> brought them into the Land of Promise, so shall the Saviour bring you into the Garden of Delight. And as <small>JOSHUA</small> slew the seven Kings of <small>CANAAN</small>, so shall the Saviour slay the seven heads of <small>’IBLÎS</small>.<a name="page_110_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_110_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a> And as <small>JOSHUA</small> destroyed the people of <small>CANAAN</small>, so shall the Saviour destroy sinners and shut them up in the fortress of <small>SHEÔL</small>. And as thou hast built the house of God, so shall churches be built upon the tops of the mountains."</p>
