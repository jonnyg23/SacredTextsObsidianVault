 <p>   And therefore the children of <small>ISHMAEL</small> became kings over <small>TEREB</small>, and over <small>ḲEBEṬ</small>, and over <small>NÔBÂ</small>, and <small>SÔBA</small>, and <small>KUERGUE</small>, and <small>KÎFÎ</small>, and <small>MÂKÂ</small>, and <small>MÔRNÂ</small>, and <small>FÎNḲÂNÂ</small>, and <small>’ARSÎBÂNÂ</small>, and <small>LÎBÂ</small>, and <small>MASE‛A</small>, for they were the seed of <small>SHEM</small>. And <small>ISAAC</small> reigned over <small>JUDAH</small> and over <small>’AMÔRÊWÔN</small>, and over <small>KÊṬÊWÔN</small>, and <small>’ÎYÂBÛSÊWÔN</small>, and <small>FÊRZÊWÔN</small>, and <small>’EÊWÊWÔN</small>, and <small>KÊḲÊDÊWÔN</small>, and <small>RÔMYÂ</small>, and <small>’ANṢÔKYÂ </small>(<small>ANTIOCHIA</small>), and <small>SÔRYÂ</small> (<small>SYRIA</small>), and <small>ARMENIA</small>, and <small>FELESṬEÊM</small> (<small>PALESTINE</small>), and <small>ETHIOPIA</small>, and <small>EDOM</small>, and <small>PHILISTIA</small>, and <small>ÎYÔÂB</small>, and <small>AMALEK</small>, and <small>PHRYGIA</small>, and <small>BABYLON</small>, and <small>YÔNÂNESṬ</small>, and <small>’EBRÂYAST</small>. For as God sware He gave all kingdoms to the seed of <small>SHEM</small>, and an exalted throne and dominion to the seed of <small>SHEM</small>, even as his father <small>NOAH</small>, by the word of God, blessed his son <small>SHEM</small>, saying, "Be lord to thy brethren and reign over them." And this that he said had reference to the Redeemer, the King of us all, <small>JESUS CHRIST</small> the King of heaven and earth, Who magnifieth kings, and Who when He pleaseth abrogateth their power; for unto Him belong power and dominion over all created things for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
