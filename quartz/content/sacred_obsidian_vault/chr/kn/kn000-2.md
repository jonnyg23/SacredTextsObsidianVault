 <h2 align="CENTER">PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION</h2>
 
 <p>   This volume contains a complete English translation of the famous Ethiopian work, The "<small>KEBRA NAGAST</small>", i.e. the "Glory of the Kings [of <small>ETHIOPIA</small>]". This work has been held in peculiar honour in <small>ABYSSINIA</small> for several centuries, and throughout that country it has been, and still is, venerated by the people as containing the final proof of their descent from the Hebrew Patriarchs, and of the kinship of their kings of the Solomonic line with <small>CHRIST</small>, the Son of God. The importance of the book, both for the kings and the people of <small>ABYSSINIA</small>, is clearly shown by the letter that King <small>JOHN</small> of <small>ETHIOPIA</small> wrote to the late Lord <small>GRANVILLE</small> in August, 1872. The king says: "There is a book called 'Kivera Negust' which contains the Law of the whole of <small>ETHIOPIA</small>, and the names of the <small>SHÛMS</small> [i.e. Chiefs], and Churches, and Provinces are in this book. I pray you find out who has got this book, and send it to me, for in my country my people will not obey my orders without it." (See <i>infra</i>, p. xxxv). The first summary of the contents of the <small>KEBRA NAGAST</small> was published by <small>BRUCE</small> as far back as 1813, but little interest was roused by his somewhat bald précis. And, in spite of the labours of <small>PRÆTORIUS</small>, <small>BEZOLD</small>, and <small>HUGUES LE ROUX</small>, the contents of the work are still practically unknown to the general reader in England. It is hoped that the translation given in the following pages will be of use to those who have not the time or opportunity for perusing the Ethiopic original.</p>
 
 <p>   The <small>KEBRA NAGAST</small> is a great storehouse of legends and traditions, some historical and some of a purely folk-lore character, derived from the Old Testament and the later Rabbinic writings, and from Egyptian (both pagan and Christian), Arabian, and Ethiopian sources. Of the early history of the compilation and its maker, and of its subsequent editors we know nothing, but the principal

 groundwork of its earliest form was the traditions that were current in <small>SYRIA</small>, <small>PALESTINE</small>, <small>ARABIA</small>, and <small>EGYPT</small> during the first four centuries of the Christian era. Weighing carefully all that has been written by <small>DILLMANN</small>, <small>TRUMP</small>, <small>ZOTENBERG</small>, <small>WRIGHT</small>, and <small>BEZOLD</small>, and taking into account the probabilities of the matter, it seems to me that we shall not be far wrong if we assign the composition of the earliest form of the <small>KEBRA NAGAST</small> to the sixth century <small>A.D.</small> Its compiler was probably a Coptic priest, for the books he used were writings that were accepted by the Coptic Church. Whether he lived in <small>EGYPT</small>, or in <small>AKSÛM</small>, or in some other part of <small>ETHIOPIA</small> matters little, but the colophons of the extant Ethiopic MSS. of the <small>KEBRA NAGAST</small> suggest that he wrote in Coptic.</p>
 
 <p>   In the succeeding centuries, probably as a result of the widespread conquests of <small>MUḤAMMAD</small> and his <small>KHALÎFAHS</small>, the Coptic text was in whole or part translated into Arabic, and during the process of translation many additions were made to it, chiefly from Arabic sources. Last of all this Arabic version was translated into Ethiopic, and proper names underwent curious transformations in the process. According to the colophons of the MSS. in the <small>BRITISH MUSEUM</small>, <small>OXFORD</small>, and <small>PARIS</small>, the Arabic translation was made from the Coptic in the 409th "year of mercy", when <small>GABRA MASḲAL</small>, commonly known as <small>LÂLÎBALÂ</small>, was reigning over <small>ETHIOPIA</small>, i.e. between <small>A.D.</small> 1314 and 1344. And the same authorities say that the Ethiopic translation was made subsequently by one <small>ISAAC</small>, of whom nothing is known save that he was an enthusiastic Christian visionary and patriot. His knowledge of history and chronology was defective, and his comparative philology is unusually peculiar, even for the period in which he lived.</p>
 
 <p>   In the colophons <small>ISAAC</small> says: "I have toiled much for the glory of the kingdom of <small>ETHIOPIA</small>, and for the going forth (manifestation ?) of the heavenly <small>ZION</small>, and for the glory of the King of <small>ETHIOPIA</small>." These words throw
 
 
 
 <a name="page_xvii"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. xvii</font></a>
 
 some light upon <small>ISAAC'S</small> motive in translating the book, and supply the reason for his devoted labour. He firmly believed: 1. That the lawful kings of <small>ETHIOPIA</small> were descended from <small>SOLOMON</small>, King of <small>ISRAEL</small>. 2. That the Tabernacle of the Law of God, i.e. the Ark of the Covenant, had been brought from <small>JERUSALEM</small> to <small>’AKSÛM</small> by <small>MENYELEK</small>, <small>SOLOMON'S</small> firstborn son, according to the <small>ETHIOPIANS</small>. 3. That the God of <small>ISRAEL</small> had transferred His place of abode on earth from <small>JERUSALEM</small> to <small>’AKSÛM</small> (<small>AXUM</small>), the ecclesiastical and political capital of <small>ETHIOPIA</small>. The means employed by <small>MENYELEK</small> for obtaining possession of the Ark of the Covenant did not disturb <small>ISAAC'S</small> conscience in the least, nay he gloried in them, for manifestly <small>MENYELEK</small> was performing the Will of God in removing the tabernacle of <small>ZION</small> from <small>JERUSALEM</small>. God, according to <small>ISAAC</small>, was satisfied that the <small>JEWS</small> were unworthy to be custodians of the Ark wherein His Presence was, and the Ark wished to depart. <small>ETHIOPIA</small> had stretched out her hands to God (Psalm lxviii. 31), and He went to her, with the Ark, to preside over <small>MENYELEK'S</small> kingdom, which was established in accordance with the commands that He had given to <small>MOSES</small> and the prophets and priests of <small>ISRAEL</small>.</p>
 
 <p>   It will be remembered that the line of kings founded by <small>SOLOMON</small> continued to reign even after the <small>ETHIOPIANS</small> became Christians under the teaching of <small>FRUMENTIUS</small> and <small>ADESIUS</small>, the slaves of the merchant <small>MEROPIUS</small>, and that the line continued unbroken until the tenth century of our era. <small>ISAAC</small> knew that God then permitted the line to be broken, and allowed the <small>ZÂGUÊ</small> kings to reign over <small>ETHIOPIA</small> until the reign of <small>YĔKÛNÔ ’AMLÂK</small>, who restored the Solomonic line in 1270, and he makes no attempt to justify God's action in this matter, or to explain it. We learn, however, from the first section of the colophon, that he wondered why God had neglected to have the Arabic version of the <small>KEBRA NAGAST</small> translated into the "speech of <small>ABYSSINIA</small>" at an
 
 
 
 <a name="page_xviii"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. xviii</font></a>
 
 earlier date, and why <small>’ABU’L-’IZZ</small> and <small>’ABU’L-FARAJ</small>, who made the Arabic translation from the Coptic, did not make a rendering into Ethiopic also. In the explanation which he attempts to give, he reminds us that the Arabic translation appeared whilst the <small>ZÂGUÊ</small> kings were still reigning. As the <small>KEBRA NAGAST</small> was written to glorify the Solomonic line of kings, and its editors and translators regarded the <small>ZÂGUÊ</small> kings not only as non-<small>ISRAELITES</small>, but as "transgressors of the Law", the appearance of a translation of it in the vernacular whilst the <small>ZÂGUÊ</small> were still on the throne would be followed by the torture and death of its producers, and the destruction of their work.</p>
 
 <p>   There is extant in Ethiopian literature a legend to the effect that when God made <small>ADAM</small> He placed in his body a "Pearl", which He intended should pass from it into the bodies of a series of holy men, one after the other, until the appointed time when it should enter the body of <small>ḤANNÂ</small>,<a name="page_xviii_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_xviii_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a> and form the substance of her daughter the <small>VIRGIN MARY</small>. Now this "Pearl" passed through the body of <small>SOLOMON</small>, an ancestor of <small>CHRIST</small>, and <small>CHRIST</small> and <small>MENYELEK</small>, the son of <small>SOLOMON</small> by the Queen of <small>SHEBA</small>, were sons of <small>SOLOMON</small>, and according to Ethiopian ideas they were akin to each other. But <small>CHRIST</small> was the Son of God, and, therefore, being the kinsman of <small>CHRIST</small>, <small>MENYELEK</small> was divine. And <small>ISAAC</small> the Ethiopian, holding this view, maintains in the <small>KEBRA NAGAST</small> that the kings of <small>ETHIOPIA</small> who were descended from <small>MENYELEK</small> were of divine origin, and that their words and deeds were those of gods.</p>
 
 <p>   Now the idea of the divine origin of kings in <small>ETHIOPIA</small>, the <small>SÛDÂN</small>, and <small>EGYPT</small>, is very old, and it appears to have been indigenous. According to a legend given in the <small>WESTCAR PAPYRUS</small> in <small>BERLIN</small>, three of the great kings of the Vth dynasty in <small>EGYPT</small> were the sons of the god <small>RĀ</small> by <small>RUṬṬEṬ</small>, the wife of <small>RUṬṬEṬUSER</small>, high priest of <small>RĀ</small>, and
 
 
 
 <a name="page_xix"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. xix</font></a>
 
 before the close of that dynasty every king called himself "son of <small>RĀ</small>". Many a king of <small>EGYPT</small> states in his inscriptions that he reigned "in the egg", i.e. before he was born, and we are to understand that the egg was deposited in his mother by the form of the Sun-god, who was his father. Some of the sovereigns of the XVIIIth dynasty, certainly those who were the nominees of the priests of <small>ȦMEN</small>, were declared to be the actual children of <small>ȦMEN</small>, and to be of his substance. On the walls of the famous temple which the architect <small>SENMUT</small> built for Queen <small>ḤATSHEPSUT</small> in Western <small>THEBES</small>, there is a series of bas-reliefs in which the god <small>ȦMEN</small> is seen companying with the mother of that Queen, and <small>ḤATSHEPSUT</small> regarded herself as <small>ȦMEN'S</small> daughter. In the temple of Luxor there are bas-reliefs of a similar character, and the god <small>ȦMEN</small> is seen occupying the couch of the queen who became by him the mother of <small>ȦMENḤETEP</small> III. This king was so thoroughly convinced of his divine origin that he caused an effigy of himself to be sculptured on the walls of the temple of <small>SÛLB</small> in the Egyptian <small>SÛDÂN</small>, together with the figures of the great gods of <small>EGYPT</small>. In fact he shared the worship of the people with the gods and goddesses of <small>EGYPT</small>. <small>RAMESES THE GREAT</small> was held to be the son of the god <small>PTAḤ-TANEN</small>, and in the inscription on a stele at <small>ABU SIMBEL</small> this god, in addressing the king, says: "I am thy father.  Thou was begotten by the gods. All thy members are from the gods. I made myself assume the form of the <small>RAM</small>, the Lord of Tet-t, my seed stood in thy august mother"</p>

 <p>   A thousand years later a story arose in <small>EGYPT</small> to the effect that <small>ALEXANDER THE GREAT</small> was the son of the god <small>ȦMEN</small> of <small>EGYPT</small>, and <small>ALEXANDER'S</small> councillors promptly took advantage of it to forward the fortunes of their lord. If, they argued, <small>ALEXANDER</small> is the son of <small>ȦMEN</small>, he is the lawful king of <small>EGYPT</small>, and the <small>EGYPTIANS</small> must acknowledge him as their king. But it was necessary for their purpose that <small>ȦMEN</small> should acknowledge <small>ALEXANDER</small> as his son, and they therefore took him to the Oasis of <small>SÎWAH</small> in the Libyan Desert, and presented him to the god <small>ȦMEN</small> of <small>LIBYA</small>. The god admitted that <small>ALEXANDER</small> was his son, the priesthood of <small>ȦMEN</small> accepted the declaration of their god, the <small>EGYPTIANS</small> believed that the holy blood of <small>ȦMEN</small> flowed in <small>ALEXANDER'S</small> veins, and as a result he became the king of the South and the North, and Governor of the Domain of <small>HORUS</small> without striking a blow. The native novelists and story-tellers, e.g. the <small>PSEUDO CALLISTHENES</small>, declared that when <small>NECTANEBUS</small> II, the last native king of <small>EGYPT</small>, fled from <small>EGYPT</small> he went to <small>MACEDON</small>, where he established himself as a magician. Here he became acquainted with Queen <small>OLYMPIAS</small>, who wished to find out from him if her husband, <small>PHILIP</small>, intended to put her away. An intimacy sprang up between <small>NECTANEBUS</small> and <small>OLYMPIAS</small>, and he appeared to the queen one night in the form of the god <small>ȦMEN</small> of <small>LIBYA</small>, arrayed in all the attributes of the god, and begot <small>ALEXANDER THE GREAT</small>. Tradition transferred the horns of <small>ȦMEN</small> to <small>ALEXANDER</small>, and ancient Arab writers call <small>ALEXANDER</small> "<small>DHU’L-ḲARNÊN</small>", i.e. "provided with two horns", a title that translates exactly one of the titles of <small>ȦMEN</small>, "Sepṭ ābui" <a name="img_xx"></a>
 <img src="img/xx.jpg"></p>
 
 <p>   <small>ISAAC</small>, the editor and translator of the <small>KEBRA NAGAST</small>, and his fellow countrymen saw nothing strange in the fact that <small>MÂKĔDÂ</small>, the virgin queen of <small>SÂBA</small>, gave herself to <small>SOLOMON</small>, for she believed him to be of divine origin, and he was to her as a god. Moreover, he was
 
 
 
 <a name="page_xxi"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. xxi</font></a>
 
 the custodian of the "Heavenly <small>ZION</small>, the Tabernacle of the Law of God", whence he obtained daily the renewal of his divinity, and power, and authority. The Tabernacle of the Law had much in common with the arks or divine tabernacles of the <small>BABYLONIANS</small> and <small>EGYPTIANS</small>, which formed the places of abode of figures of gods or their most characteristic emblems. The ark of <small>BEL</small>, the great god of <small>BABYLON</small>, contained a figure of the god, and the king visited it ceremonially once a year, and sued with tears for forgiveness, and grasped the hand or hands of the sacred figure. The chamber in which the figure abode was believed to have been built by the gods. On high days and holy days the ark was carried by the priests in procession. In <small>EGYPT</small> the arks of the gods were kept in chambers specially constructed for the purpose, and the figures of the gods were seated on thrones inside them. These arks were placed upon sledges or in boats and were carried by the priests in procession on great days of festival or on solemn days. We know from the inscriptions that the ark of <small>ȦMEN</small> was provided with doors that were kept bolted and sealed. On certain occasions the king had the right to break these seals and unbolt the doors, and look upon the face of the god. Thus, after his conquest of <small>EGYPT</small>, the Nubian king <small>PIĀNKHI</small> went to visit <small>RĀ</small> in his sanctuary near <small>HELIOPOLIS</small>. He was received by the <small>KHERḤEB</small> priest, who prayed that the fiends might have no power over him. Having arrayed himself in the sacred seṭeb garment, and been censed and asperged, <small>PIĀNKHI</small> ascended the steps leading to the ark of <small>RĀ</small> and stood there alone. He broke the seal, drew the bolts, threw open the doors and looked upon the face of <small>RĀ</small>. Having adored the Māṭet and Sektet Boats he drew together the doors and sealed them with his seal. In this way <small>PIĀNKHI</small> was recognized by <small>RĀ</small> as the king of all <small>EGYPT</small>. It is not clear whether it was a figure of <small>RĀ</small> or the holy benben stone, the symbol of the god, which <small>PIĀNKHI</small>
 
 
 
 <a name="page_xxii"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. xxii</font></a>
 
 looked upon. Many of the sacred arks of <small>EGYPT</small> contained no figures of gods, but only objects symbolic of them; in the temples of Osiris the arks contained portions of the body of this god.</p>
 
 <p>   The Ark of the Law which <small>MENYELEK</small> covered and stole from the Temple of <small>JERUSALEM</small> was probably a copy of that made by <small>MOSES</small>, and to all intents and purposes it was a rectangular box, made of hard wood plated with gold, and measuring about four feet long, two feet six inches wide, and two feet six inches deep. It was provided with a cover upon which rested the Mercy seat and figures of the Cherubim. In the <small>KEBRA NAGAST</small> no mention is made of the Mercy seat and the Cherubim, but we read there that <small>MOSES</small> made a case in shape like the "belly of a ship", and in this the Two Tables of the Law were placed. To the <small>ETHIOPIANS</small> this case symbolized the <small>VIRGIN MARY</small>; the case made by <small>MOSES</small> carried the Word in stone, and Mary carried the Word Incarnate. It cannot be assumed that the Ark stolen by <small>MENYELEK</small> was carried in a sacred boat like an Egyptian shrine, even though the "belly of a ship" is mentioned in connection with it. In several chapters of the <small>KEBRA NAGAST</small> the "chariot of the Tabernacle of the Law" is mentioned, a fact which suggests that in later days at least the sacred box was provided with a carriage or sledge. History is silent as to the place where the Tabernacle of the Law was finally deposited, but Ethiopian tradition asserts that it survived all the troubles and disasters that fell upon the <small>ABYSSINIANS</small> in their wars with the Muslims, and that it was preserved at <small>’AKSÛM</small> until comparatively recent times.</p>
 
 <p>   In the short introduction that follows I have given a sketch of the literary history of the <small>KEBRA NAGAST</small>, with references to the authorities on the subject, and I have made an abstract of its contents in narrative form which will, I hope, be useful. A full discussion of every portion of the work, with extracts giving the original texts

 of the authorities used and quoted by <small>ISAAC</small> the scribe, would fill another volume, and the cost of printing, paper, and binding is now so great that the idea of producing such a book has been abandoned. A translation of the Arabic text describing how the Kingdom of <small>DAVID</small> was transferred from <small>JERUSALEM</small> to <small>ETHIOPIA</small> has been added, for this interesting document is practically unknown in England. The pictures of events described in the Old and New Testaments, given in this book, are taken from Ethiopic MSS. in the <small>BRITISH MUSEUM</small>; they show as nothing else can the religious beliefs and traditions of the <small>ETHIOPIANS</small>, and at the same time they serve as examples of the drawings and designs with which they illustrated their manuscripts. Nearly all of them depict Scriptural events described or referred to in the <small>KEBRA NAGAST</small>.</p>
