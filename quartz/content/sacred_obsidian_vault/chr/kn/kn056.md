 <p>   And when <small>ZADOK</small> the priest returned to <small>SOLOMON</small> the King he found him sorrowful. And the King answered and said unto <small>ZADOK</small> the priest, "When the Queen came there appeared to me by night this vision: It

 seemed as if I were standing in the chamber of <small>JERUSALEM</small>, and the sun came down from heaven into the land of <small>JUDAH</small>, and lighted it up with great splendour. And having tarried a time it went down and lighted up the Country of <small>ETHIOPIA</small>, and it did not return to the land of <small>JUDAH</small>. And again the sun came down from heaven to the country of <small>JUDAH</small>, and lighted it up more brilliantly than it did the first time; but the <small>ISRAELITES</small> paid no heed to it, and they wished to extinguish its light. And it rose below the earth in a place where it was not expected, and it illumined the country of <small>RÔM</small>, and the country of <small>ETHIOPIA</small>, and afterwards all those who believed on it."</p>
 
 <p>   And <small>ZADOK</small> the priest answered and said unto him, "O my lord, why didst thou not tell me before that thou hadst seen a vision of this kind? Thou makest my knees to tremble. Woe be unto us, if our sons have carried off our Lady, the holy, heavenly <small>ZION</small>, the Tabernacle of the Law of God!" And the King answered and said unto him, "Our wisdom is forgotten and our understanding is buried. Verily the sun that appeared unto me long ago when I was sleeping with the Queen of <small>ETHIOPIA</small> was the symbol of the holy <small>ZION</small>. But tell me: yesterday when thou didst take off the splendid covering that was lying upon <small>ZION</small>, didst thou not make certain that <small>ZION</small> was [there]?" And <small>ZADOK</small> the priest answered and said, "I did not, lord; it had three coverings over it, and I took off the outermost, and dressed <small>ZION</small> in the covering which thou didst give me, and I brought [the other] to thee." And the King said unto <small>ZADOK</small>, "Go quickly and look at our Lady and examine her closely." And <small>ZADOK</small> the priest took the keys, and went and opened the house of the sanctuary, and he examined [the place] quickly, and he found there nothing except the wooden boards which <small>AZÂRYÂS</small> had fastened together and had made to resemble the sides of the pedestal of <small>ZION</small>.</p>
