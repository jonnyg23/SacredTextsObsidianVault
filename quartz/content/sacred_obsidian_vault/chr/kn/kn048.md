And he raised up <small>AZÂRYÂS</small> and said unto him, "Stand up, be strong, and rouse up thy brother <small>ÊLMĔYÂS</small>, and <small>’ABĔSÂ</small>, and <small>MÂKARÎ</small>, and take the pieces of wood and I will open for thee the doors of the sanctuary. And take thou the Tabernacle of the Law of God, and thou shalt carry it without trouble and discomfort. And I, inasmuch as I have been commanded by God to be with it for ever, will be thy guide when thou shalt carry it away."</p>

And the four of them carried <small>ZION</small> away, and they brought it into the house of <small>AZÂRYÂS</small>, and they went back into the house of God, and they set the pieces of wood on the place where <small>ZION</small> had been, and they covered them over with the covering of <small>ZION</small>, and they shut the doors, and went back to their houses. And they took lamps and set them in the place where [<small>ZION</small>] was hidden, and they sacrificed the sheep thereto, and burned offerings of incense thereto, and they spread purple cloths over it and set it in a secret place for seven days and seven nights.</p>
