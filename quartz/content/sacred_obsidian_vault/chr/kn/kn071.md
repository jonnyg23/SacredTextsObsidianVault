 <p>   And from this it is evident that <small>MARY</small> was the daughter of <small>DAVID</small>, and that <small>JOSEPH</small> was the son of <small>DAVID</small>. Therefore was <small>MARY</small> betrothed to <small>JOSEPH</small> her kinsman, as it is said in the Gospel, "O <small>JOSEPH</small>, son of <small>DAVID</small>, fear thou not to take to wife <small>MARY</small> thy betrothed, for that which is to be born of her is of the Holy Spirit, the Word of God."<a name="page_121_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_121_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a> And there was born of her God, the Word, Light of Light, God of God, Son of the Father, Who came and delivered His creation; from the hand of <small>SHEÔL</small>, and from <small>SATAN</small>, and from death He hath delivered all of us who have believed in Him, He hath drawn us to His Father and hath raised us up into heaven His throne to become His heirs; for He is a lover of man, and unto Him praise belongeth for ever. Amen.</p>
