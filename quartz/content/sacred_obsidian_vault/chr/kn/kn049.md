 <p>   And then the King of <small>ETHIOPIA</small> rose up to depart to his country, and he came to his father that he might pray on his behalf, and he said unto him, "Bless me, father"; and he made obeisance unto him. And the King raised him up, and blessed him, and embraced his head, and said, "Blessed be the Lord my God Who blessed my father <small>DAVID</small>, and Who blessed our father <small>ABRAHAM</small>.

 themselves under the sole of thy foot. And my Lady <small>ZION</small>, the holy and heavenly, the Tabernacle of the Law of God, shall be a guide unto thee at all times, a guide in respect of what thou shouldst think in thy heart and shouldst do with thy fingers, whether it be far or near to thee, whether it be low or high to thee, whether it be strong or weak to thee, whether it be outside or inside thee, whether it be to thee in the house or in the field, whether it be visible or invisible to thee, whether it be away from or near to thee, whether it be hidden from or revealed to thee, whether it be secret or published abroad to thee—unto thee our Lady <small>ZION</small>, the holy and heavenly, the pure Tabernacle of the Law of God, shall be a guide." And <small>DAVID</small> was blessed, and he made obeisance, and departed.</p>
