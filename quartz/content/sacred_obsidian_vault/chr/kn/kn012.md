 <p>   Now, it was <small>CANAAN</small> who rent the kingdom from the children of <small>SHEM</small>, and he transgressed the oath which his father <small>NOAH</small> had made them to swear. And the sons of <small>CANAAN</small> were seven mighty men, and he took seven mighty cities from the land of <small>SHEM</small>, and set his sons over them; and likewise he also made his own portion double. And in later days God took vengeance upon the sons of <small>CANAAN</small>, and made the sons of <small>SHEM</small> to inherit their country. These are the nations whom they inherited: the <small>CANAANITES</small>, the <small>PERIZZITES</small>, the <small>HIVITES</small>, the <small>HITTITES</small>, the <small>AMORITES</small>, the <small>JEBUSITES</small>, and

 the <small>GIRGASITES</small>; these are they whom <small>CANAAN</small> seized by force from the seed of <small>SHEM</small>. For it was not right for him to invade [his] kingdom, and to falsify the oath, and because of this they ceased to be, and their memorial perished, through transgressing [God's] command, and worshipping idols, and bowing down to those who were not gods.</p>
 
 <p>   And after the death of <small>SHEM</small> <small>ARPHAXAD</small> reigned, and after the death of <small>ARPHAXAD</small> <small>ḲÂYNÂN</small><a name="page_9_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_9_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a> (<small>CAINAN</small>) reigned, and after the death of <small>ḲÂYNÂN</small> <small>SÂLÂ</small> (<small>SALAH</small>) reigned, and after him <small>EBER</small> reigned, and after him <small>PÂLÊḲ</small> (<small>PELEG</small>) reigned, and after him <small>RÂGÂW</small> (<small>REU</small>) reigned, and after him <small>SÊRÔḤ</small> (<small>SERUG</small>) reigned, and after him <small>NÂKHÔR</small> (<small>NAHOR</small>) reigned, and after him <small>TÂRÂ</small> (<small>TERAH</small>) reigned. And these are they who made magical images, and they went to the tombs of their fathers and made an image (or, picture) of gold, and silver, and brass, and a devil used to hold converse with them out of each of the images of their fathers, and say unto them, "O my son So-and-so, offer up unto me as a sacrifice the son whom thou lovest." And they slaughtered their sons and their daughters to the devils, and they poured out innocent blood to filthy devils.</p>
