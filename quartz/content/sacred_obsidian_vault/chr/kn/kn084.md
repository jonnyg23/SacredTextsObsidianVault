 <small>JERUSALEM</small> at the city of <small>WAḲÊRÔM</small> in a single day. And they sent messengers in ships to announce [their arrival] to <small>MÂKĔDÂ</small>, the Queen of <small>ETHIOPIA</small>, and to report to her how they had found every good thing, and how her son had become king, and how they had brought the heavenly <small>ZION</small>. And she caused all this glorious news to be spread abroad, and she made a herald to go round about in all the country that was subject unto her, ordering the people to meet her son and more particularly the heavenly <small>ZION</small>, the Tabernacle of the God of <small>ISRAEL</small>. And they blew horns before her, and all the people of <small>ETHIOPIA</small> rejoiced, from the least to the greatest, men as well as women; and the soldiers rose up with her to meet their King. And she came to the city of the Government, which is the chief city of the kingdom of <small>ETHIOPIA</small>; now in later times this [city] became the chief city of the Christians of <small>ETHIOPIA</small>. And in it she caused to be prepared perfumes innumerable from <small>INDIA</small>, and from <small>BÂLTÊ</small> to <small>GÂLTÊT</small>, and from <small>’ALSÂFU</small> to <small>’AZAZAT</small>, and had them brought together there. And her son came by the <small>’AZYÂBÂ</small> road to <small>WAḲÊRÔM</small>, and he came forth to <small>MASAS</small>, and ascended to <small>BÛR</small>, and arrived at the city of the Government, the capital [city] of <small>ETHIOPIA</small>, which the Queen herself had built and called "<small>DABRA MÂKĔDÂ</small>", after her own name.</p>
