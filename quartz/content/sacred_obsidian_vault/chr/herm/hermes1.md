 <h2>The Corpus Hermeticum</h2>
 
 
 
 <h3>translated by G.R.S. Mead</h3>
 
 
 
 <h2>I.  Poemandres, the Shepherd of Men</h2>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 &lt;This is the most famous of the Hermetic documents, a revelation
 
 
 
 account describing a vision of the creation of the universe and
 
 
 
 the nature and fate of humanity.  Authors from the Renaissance
 
 
 
 onward have been struck by the way in which its creation myth
 
 
 
 seems partly inspired by <i>Genesis</i>, partly reacting against
 
 
 
 it.  The Fall has here become the descent of the Primal Man through
 
 
 
 the spheres of the planets to the world of Nature, a descent caused
 
 
 
 not by disobedience but by love, and done with the blessing of
 
 
 
 God.  
 
 
 
 <p>
 
 
 
 &lt;The seven rulers of fate discussed in sections 9, 14 and
 
 
 
 25 are the archons of the seven planets, which also appear in
 
 
 
 Plato's <i>Timaeus</i> and in a number of the ancient writings
 
 
 
 usually lumped together as "Gnostic".  Their role here
 
 
 
 is an oddly ambivalent one, powers of Harmony who are nonetheless
 
 
 
 the sources of humanity's tendencies to evil.  - JMG&gt;

 1.  It chanced once on a time my mind was meditating on the
 
 
 
 things that are, my thought was raised to a great height, the
 
 
 
 senses of my body being held back - just as men who are weighed
 
 
 
 down with sleep after a fill of food, or from fatigue of body.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 Methought a Being more than vast, in size beyond all bounds,
 
 
 
 called out my name and saith:  What wouldst thou hear and see,
 
 
 
 and what hast thou in mind to learn and know?
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 2.  And I do say:  Who art thou?  
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 He saith:  I am Man-Shepherd (Poemandres), Mind of all-masterhood;
 
 
 
 I know what thou desirest and I'm with thee everywhere.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 3.  [And] I reply:  I long to learn the things that are, and
 
 
 
 comprehend their nature, and know God.  This is, I said, what
 
 
 
 I desire to hear.  
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 He answered back to me:  Hold in thy mind all thou wouldst
 
 
 
 know, and I will teach thee.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 4.  E'en with these words His aspect changed, and straightway,
 
 
 
 in the twinkling of an eye, all things were opened to me, and
 
 
 
 I see a Vision limitless, all things turned into Light - sweet,
 
 
 
 joyous [Light].  And I became transported as I gazed.  
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 But in a little while Darkness came settling down on part
 
 
 
 [of it], awesome and gloomy, coiling in sinuous folds, so that
 
 
 
 methought it like unto a snake.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 And then the Darkness changed into some sort of a Moist Nature,
 
 
 
 tossed about beyond all power of words, belching out smoke as
 
 
 
 from a fire, and groaning forth a wailing sound that beggars all
 
 
 
 description.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 [And] after that an outcry inarticulate came forth from it,
 
 
 
 as though it were a Voice of Fire.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 5.  [Thereon] out of the Light [...] a Holy Word (Logos) descended
 
 
 
 on that Nature.  And upwards to the height from the Moist Nature
 
 
 
 leaped forth pure Fire; light was it, swift and active too.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 The Air, too, being light, followed after the Fire; from out
 
 
 
 of the Earth-and-Water rising up to Fire so that it seemed to
 
 
 
 hang therefrom.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 But Earth-and-Water stayed so mingled with each other, that
 
 
 
 Earth from Water no one could discern.  Yet were they moved to
 
 
 
 hear by reason of the Spirit-Word (Logos) pervading them.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 6.  Then saith to me Man-Shepherd:  Didst understand this
 
 
 
 Vision what it means?
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 Nay; that shall I know, said I.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 That Light, He said, am I, thy God, Mind, prior to Moist Nature
 
 
 
 which appeared from Darkness; the Light-Word (Logos) [that appeared]
 
 
 
 from Mind is Son of God.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 What then? - say I.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 Know that what sees in thee and hears is the Lord's Word (Logos);
 
 
 
 but Mind is Father-God.  Not separate are they the one from other;
 
 
 
 just in their union [rather] is it Life consists.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 Thanks be to Thee, I said.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 So, understand the Light [He answered], and make friends with
 
 
 
 it.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 7.  And speaking thus He gazed for long into my eyes, so that
 
 
 
 I trembled at the look of him.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 But when He raised His head, I see in Mind the Light, [but]
 
 
 
 now in Powers no man could number, and Cosmos grown beyond all
 
 
 
 bounds, and that the Fire was compassed round about by a most
 
 
 
 mighty Power, and [now] subdued had come unto a stand.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 And when I saw these things I understood by reason of Man-Shepherd's
 
 
 
 Word (Logos).
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 8.  But as I was in great astonishment, He saith to me again:
 
 
 
  Thou didst behold in Mind the Archetypal Form whose being is
 
 
 
 before beginning without end.  Thus spake to me Man-Shepherd.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 And I say:  Whence then have Nature's elements their being?
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 To this He answer gives:  From Will of God.  [Nature] received
 
 
 
 the Word (Logos), and gazing upon the Cosmos Beautiful did copy
 
 
 
 it, making herself into a cosmos, by means of her own elements
 
 
 
 and by the births of souls.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 9.  And God-the-Mind, being male and female both, as Light
 
 
 
 and Life subsisting, brought forth another Mind to give things
 
 
 
 form, who, God as he was of Fire and Spirit, formed Seven Rulers
 
 
 
 who enclose the cosmos that the sense perceives.  Men call their
 
 
 
 ruling Fate.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 10.  Straightway from out the downward elements God's Reason
 
 
 
 (Logos) leaped up to Nature's pure formation, and was at-oned
 
 
 
 with the Formative Mind; for it was co-essential with it.  And
 
 
 
 Nature's downward elements were thus left reason-less, so as to
 
 
 
 be pure matter.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 11.  Then the Formative Mind ([at-oned] with Reason), he who
 
 
 
 surrounds the spheres and spins them with his whorl, set turning
 
 
 
 his formations, and let them turn from a beginning boundless unto
 
 
 
 an endless end.  For that the circulation of these [spheres] begins
 
 
 
 where it doth end, as Mind doth will.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 And from the downward elements Nature brought forth lives
 
 
 
 reason-less; for He did not extend the Reason (Logos) [to them].
 
 
 
  The Air brought forth things winged; the Water things that swim,
 
 
 
 and Earth-and-Water one from another parted, as Mind willed. 
 
 
 
 And from her bosom Earth produced what lives she had, four-footed
 
 
 
 things and reptiles, beasts wild and tame.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 12.  But All-Father Mind, being Life and Light, did bring
 
 
 
 forth Man co-equal to Himself, with whom He fell in love, as being
 
 
 
 His own child; for he was beautiful beyond compare, the Image
 
 
 
 of his Sire.  In very truth, God fell in love with his own Form;
 
 
 
 and on him did bestow all of His own formations.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 13.  And when he gazed upon what the Enformer had created
 
 
 
 in the Father, [Man] too wished to enform; and [so] assent was
 
 
 
 given him by the Father.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 Changing his state to the formative sphere, in that he was
 
 
 
 to have his whole authority, he gazed upon his Brother's creatures.
 
 
 
  They fell in love with him, and gave him each a share of his
 
 
 
 own ordering.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 And after that he had well learned their essence and had become
 
 
 
 a sharer in their nature, he had a mind to break right through
 
 
 
 the Boundary of their spheres, and to subdue the might of that
 
 
 
 which pressed upon the Fire.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 14.  So he who hath the whole authority o'er [all] the mortals
 
 
 
 in the cosmos and o'er its lives irrational, bent his face downwards
 
 
 
 through the Harmony, breaking right through its strength, and
 
 
 
 showed to downward Nature God's fair form.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 And when she saw that Form of beauty which can never satiate,
 
 
 
 and him who [now] possessed within himself each single energy
 
 
 
 of [all seven] Rulers as well as God's own Form, she smiled with
 
 
 
 love; for 'twas as though she'd seen the image of Man's fairest
 
 
 
 form upon her Water, his shadow on her Earth.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 He in turn beholding the form like to himself, existing in
 
 
 
 her, in her Water, loved it and willed to live in it; and with
 
 
 
 the will came act, and [so] he vivified the form devoid of reason.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 And Nature took the object of her love and wound herself completely
 
 
 
 around him, and they were intermingled, for they were lovers.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 15.  And this is why beyond all creatures on the earth man
 
 
 
 is twofold; mortal because of body, but because of the essential
 
 
 
 man immortal.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 Though deathless and possessed of sway o'er all, yet doth
 
 
 
 he suffer as a mortal doth, subject to Fate.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 Thus though above the Harmony, within the Harmony he hath
 
 
 
 become a slave.  Though male-female, as from a Father male-female,
 
 
 
 and though he's sleepless from a sleepless [Sire], yet is he overcome
 
 
 
 [by sleep].
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 16.  Thereon [I say:  Teach on], O Mind of me, for I myself
 
 
 
 as well am amorous of the Word (Logos).
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 The Shepherd said:  This is the mystery kept hid until this
 
 
 
 day.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 Nature embraced by Man brought forth a wonder, oh so wonderful.
 
 
 
  For as he had the nature of the Concord of the Seven, who, as
 
 
 
 I said to thee, [were made] of Fire and Spirit - Nature delayed
 
 
 
 not, but immediately brought forth seven "men", in correspondence
 
 
 
 with the natures of the Seven, male-female and moving in the air.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 Thereon [I said]:  O Shepherd, ..., for now I'm filled with
 
 
 
 great desire and long to hear; do not run off.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 The Shepherd said:  Keep silence, for not as yet have I unrolled
 
 
 
 for thee the first discourse (logoi).
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 Lo!  I am still, I said.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 17.  In such wise than, as I have said, the generation of
 
 
 
 these seven came to pass.  Earth was as woman, her Water filled
 
 
 
 with longing; ripeness she took from Fire, spirit from Aether.
 
 
 
  Nature thus brought forth frames to suit the form of Man.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 And Man from Light and Life changed into soul and mind - from
 
 
 
 Life to soul, from Light to mind.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 And thus continued all the sense-world's parts until the period
 
 
 
 of their end and new beginnings.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 18.  Now listen to the rest of the discourse (Logos) which
 
 
 
 thou dost long to hear.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 The period being ended, the bond that bound them all was loosened
 
 
 
 by God's Will.  For all the animals being male-female, at the
 
 
 
 same time with Man were loosed apart; some became partly male,
 
 
 
 some in like fashion [partly] female.  And straightway God spake
 
 
 
 by His Holy Word (Logos):
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 "Increase ye in increasing, and multiply in multitude,
 
 
 
 ye creatures and creations all; and man that hath Mind in him,
 
 
 
 let him learn to know that he himself is deathless, and that the
 
 
 
 cause of death is love, though Love is all."
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 19.  When He said this, His Forethought did by means of Fate
 
 
 
 and Harmony effect their couplings and their generations founded.
 
 
 
  And so all things were multiplied according to their kind.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 And he who thus hath learned to know himself, hath reached
 
 
 
 that Good which doth transcend abundance; but he who through a
 
 
 
 love that leads astray, expends his love upon his body - he stays
 
 
 
 in Darkness wandering, and suffering through his senses things
 
 
 
 of Death.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 20.  What is the so great fault, said I, the ignorant commit,
 
 
 
 that they should be deprived of deathlessness?
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 Thou seem'st, He said, O thou, not to have given heed to what
 
 
 
 thou heardest.  Did I not bid thee think?
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 Yea do I think, and I remember, and therefore give Thee thanks.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 If thou didst think [thereon], [said He], tell me:  Why do
 
 
 
 they merit death who are in Death?
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 It is because the gloomy Darkness is the root and base of
 
 
 
 the material frame; from it came the Moist Nature; from this the
 
 
 
 body in the sense-world was composed; and from this [body] Death
 
 
 
 doth the Water drain.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 21.  Right was thy thought, O thou!  But how doth "he
 
 
 
 who knows himself, go unto Him", as God's Word (Logos) hath
 
 
 
 declared?
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 And I reply:  the Father of the universals doth consist of
 
 
 
 Light and Life, from Him Man was born.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 Thou sayest well, [thus] speaking.  Light and Life is Father-God,
 
 
 
 and from Him Man was born.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 If then thou learnest that thou art thyself of Life and Light,
 
 
 
 and that thou [happen'st] to be out of them, thou shalt return
 
 
 
 again to Life.  Thus did Man-Shepherd speak.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 But tell me further, Mind of me, I cried, how shall I come
 
 
 
 to Life again...for God doth say:  "The man who hath Mind
 
 
 
 in him, let him learn to know that he himself [is deathless]."
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 22.  Have not all men then Mind?
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 Thou sayest well, O thou, thus speaking.  I, Mind, myself
 
 
 
 am present with holy men and good, the pure and merciful, men
 
 
 
 who live piously.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 [To such] my presence doth become an aid, and straightway
 
 
 
 they gain gnosis of all things, and win the Father's love by their
 
 
 
 pure lives, and give Him thanks, invoking on Him blessings, and
 
 
 
 chanting hymns, intent on Him with ardent love.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 And ere they give up the body unto its proper death, they
 
 
 
 turn them with disgust from its sensations, from knowledge of
 
 
 
 what things they operate.  Nay, it is I, the Mind, that will not
 
 
 
 let the operations which befall the body, work to their [natural]
 
 
 
 end.  For being door-keeper I'll close up [all] the entrances,
 
 
 
 and cut the mental actions off which base and evil energies induce.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 23.  But to the Mind-less ones, the wicked and depraved, the
 
 
 
 envious and covetous, and those who mured do and love impiety,
 
 
 
 I am far off, yielding my place to the Avenging Daimon, who sharpening
 
 
 
 the fire, tormenteth him and addeth fire to fire upon him, and
 
 
 
 rusheth upon him through his senses, thus rendering him readier
 
 
 
 for transgressions of the law, so that he meets with greater torment;
 
 
 
 nor doth he ever cease to have desire for appetites inordinate,
 
 
 
 insatiately striving in the dark.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 24.  Well hast thou taught me all, as I desired, O Mind. 
 
 
 
 And now, pray, tell me further of the nature of the Way Above
 
 
 
 as now it is [for me].
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 To this Man-Shepherd said:  When the material body is to be
 
 
 
 dissolved, first thou surrenderest the body by itself unto the
 
 
 
 work of change, and thus the form thou hadst doth vanish, and
 
 
 
 thou surrenderest thy way of life, void of its energy, unto the
 
 
 
 Daimon.  The body's senses next pass back into their sources,
 
 
 
 becoming separate, and resurrect as energies; and passion and
 
 
 
 desire withdraw unto that nature which is void of reason.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 25.  And thus it is that man doth speed his way thereafter
 
 
 
 upwards through the Harmony.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 To the first zone he gives the Energy of Growth and Waning;
 
 
 
 unto the second [zone], Device of Evils [now] de-energized; unto
 
 
 
 the third, the Guile of the Desires de-energized; unto the fourth,
 
 
 
 his Domineering Arrogance, [also] de-energized; unto the fifth,
 
 
 
 unholy Daring and the Rashness of Audacity, de-energized; unto
 
 
 
 the sixth, Striving for Wealth by evil means, deprived of its
 
 
 
 aggrandizement; and to the seventh zone, Ensnaring Falsehood,
 
 
 
 de-energized.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 26.  And then, with all the energisings of the harmony stript
 
 
 
 from him, clothed in his proper Power, he cometh to that Nature
 
 
 
 which belongs unto the Eighth, and there with those-that-are hymneth
 
 
 
 the Father.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 They who are there welcome his coming there with joy; and
 
 
 
 he, made like to them that sojourn there, doth further hear the
 
 
 
 Powers who are above the Nature that belongs unto the Eighth,
 
 
 
 singing their songs of praise to God in language of their own.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 And then they, in a band, go to the Father home; of their
 
 
 
 own selves they make surrender of themselves to Powers, and [thus]
 
 
 
 becoming Powers they are in God.  This the good end for those
 
 
 
 who have gained Gnosis - to be made one with God.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 Why shouldst thou then delay?  Must it not be, since thou
 
 
 
 hast all received, that thou shouldst to the worthy point the
 
 
 
 way, in order that through thee the race of mortal kind may by
 
 
 
 [thy] God be saved?
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 27.  This when He'd said, Man-Shepherd mingled with the Powers.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 But I, with thanks and belssings unto the Father of the universal
 
 
 
 [Powers], was freed, full of the power he had poured into me,
 
 
 
 and full of what He'd taught me of the nature of the All and of
 
 
 
 the loftiest Vision.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 And I began to preach unto men the Beauty of Devotion and
 
 
 
 of Gnosis:
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 O ye people, earth-born folk, ye who have given yourselves
 
 
 
 to drunkenness and sleep and ignorance of God, be sober now, cease
 
 
 
 from your surfeit, cease to be glamoured by irrational sleep!
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 28.  And when they heard, they came with one accord.  Whereon
 
 
 
 I say:
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 Ye earth-born folk, why have ye given yourselves up to Death,
 
 
 
 while yet ye have the power of sharing Deathlessness?  Repent,
 
 
 
 O ye, who walk with Error arm in arm and make of Ignorance the
 
 
 
 sharer of your board; get ye out from the light of Darkness, and
 
 
 
 take your part in Deathlessness, forsake Destruction!
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 29.  And some of them with jests upon their lips departed
 
 
 
 [from me], abandoning themselves unto the Way of Death; others
 
 
 
 entreated to be taught, casting themselves before my feet.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 But I made them arise, and I became a leader of the Race towards
 
 
 
 home, teaching the words (logoi), how and in what way they shall
 
 
 
 be saved.  I sowed in them the words (logoi) of wisdom; of Deathless
 
 
 
 Water were they given to drink.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 And when even was come and all sun's beams began to set, I
 
 
 
 bade them all give thanks to God.  And when they had brought to
 
 
 
 an end the giving of their thanks, each man returned to his own
 
 
 
 resting place.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 30.  But I recorded in my heart Man-Shepherd's benefaction,
 
 
 
 and with my every hope fulfilled more than rejoiced.  For body's
 
 
 
 sleep became the soul's awakening, and closing of the eyes - true
 
 
 
 vision, pregnant with Good my silence, and the utterance of my
 
 
 
 word (logos) begetting of good things.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 All this befell me from my Mind, that is Man-Shepherd, Word
 
 
 
 (Logos) of all masterhood, by whom being God-inspired I came unto
 
 
 
 the Plain of Truth.  Wherefore with all my soul and strength thanksgiving
 
 
 
 give I unto Father-God.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 31.  Holy art Thou, O God, the universals' Father.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 Holy art Thou, O God, whose Will perfects itself by means
 
 
 
 of its own Powers.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 Holy art Thou, O God, who willeth to be known and art known
 
 
 
 by Thine own.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 Holy art Thou,who didst by Word (Logos) make to consist the
 
 
 
 things that are.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 Holy art Thou, of whom All-nature hath been made an image.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 Holy art Thou, whose Form Nature hath never made.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 Holy art Thou, more powerful than all power.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 Holy art Thou, transcending all pre-eminence.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 Holy Thou art, Thou better than all praise.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 Accept my reason's offerings pure, from soul and heart for
 
 
 
 aye stretched up to Thee, O Thou unutterable, unspeakable, Whose
 
 
 
 Name naught but the Silence can express.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 32.  Give ear to me who pray that I may ne'er of Gnosis fail,
 
 
 
 [Gnosis] which is our common being's nature; and fill me with
 
 
 
 Thy Power, and with this Grace [of Thine], that I may give the
 
 
 
 Light to those in ignorance of the Race, my Brethren, and Thy
 
 
 
 Sons.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 For this cause I believe, and I bear witness; I go to Life
 
 
 
 and Light.  Blessed art Thou, O Father.  Thy Man would holy be
 
 
 
 as Thou art holy, e'en as Thou gave him Thy full authority [to
 
 
 
 be].
