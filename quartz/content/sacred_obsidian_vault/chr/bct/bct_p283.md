 <p><small><b>Interior of a private house</b> of a citizen of "Ur of the Chaldees" at the time of Abraham. The walls were built of clay bricks, and the floor of the courtyard was paved with flat tile-like bricks. The gallery and its roofs were supported on wooden pillars. The beasts were stabled and stores were kept in the rooms on the ground floor which were entered through arched doorways, and the sleeping and sitting rooms were entered from the gallery. A stairway led from the ground floor to the gallery and the roof. The water supply was kept in large porous pots on the ground floor. About 2100 <small>B.C.</small></small></p>
