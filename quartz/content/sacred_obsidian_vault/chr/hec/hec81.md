 <p align="center"><small>SACKVILLE COLLEGE, EAST GRINSTED.</small></p>  
 <p>'It had long been my wish, especially when I had occasion to notice the great favour which <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">God</span> had bestowed on my translations from Mediæval Hymnology, to collect some of my own Hymns and Sequences as a poor little offering to the Great Treasury. Laid aside in spring last from all active work by a severe and dangerous illness, the wish was more strongly impressed on my mind, and I felt that no kind of composition could be more suitable for one who might soon be called to have done with earthly composition for ever.'—Preface (1866).</p>

 <p>'The hymns in this neat little collection are selected from various volumes of his Sacred Poetry, and are admirably suited to form a companion to his "Readings for the Aged." Almost all of them are well-known favourites with persons acquainted with Dr. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Neale's</span> poetry, and they are such as to lead those who are yet strangers to it to lose no time in filling up this gap in their knowledge of contemporary poetry.'—<i>Literary Churchman</i>.</p>
