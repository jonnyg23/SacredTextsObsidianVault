 <h1>Apostles' Creed</h1>
 <hr>
 
 <p>1. I believe in God the Father, Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth:
 </p><p>2. And in Jesus Christ, his only begotten Son, our Lord:
 </p><p>3. Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary:
 </p><p>4. Suffered under Pontius Pilate; was crucified, dead and buried: He descended into hell:
 </p><p>5. The third day he rose again from the dead:
 </p><p>6. He ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of God the Father Almighty:
 </p><p>7. From thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead:
 </p><p>8. I believe in the Holy Ghost:
 </p><p>9. I believe in the holy catholic church: the communion of saints:
 </p><p>10. The forgiveness of sins:
 </p><p>1l. The resurrection of the body:
 </p><p>12. And the life everlasting. Amen.
