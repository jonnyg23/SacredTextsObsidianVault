 <p></p> <h4>Chapter 59</h4> <i>
 </i><p>Meeting of the sages, continued. The remaining postulates. The sages bless Jesus. Seven days' silence.<br> <br> <b>1. </b>Apollo wrote the fifth:<br> <b>2. </b>The soul is drawn to perfect light by four white steeds, and these are Will, and Faith, and Helpfulness and Love.<br> <b>3. </b>That which one wills to do, he has the power to do.<br> <b>4. </b>A knowledge of that power is faith; and when faith moves, the soul begins its flight.<br> <b>5. </b>A selfish faith leads not to light. There is no lonely pilgrim on the way to light. Men only gain the heights by helping others gain the heights.<br> <b>6. </b>The steed that leads the way to spirit life is Love; is pure unselfish Love.<br> <b>7. </b>Matheno wrote the sixth:<br> <b>8. </b>The universal Love of which Apollo speaks is child of Wisdom and of Will divine, and God has sent if forth to earth in flesh that man may know.<br> <b>9. </b>The universal Love of which the sages speak, is Christ.<br> <b>10. </b>The greatest mystery of all times lies in the way that Christ lives in the heart.<br> <b>11. </b>Christ cannot live in clammy dens of carnal things. The seven battles must be fought, the seven victories won before the carnal things, like fear, and self, emotions and desire, are put away.<br> <b>12. </b>When this is done the Christ will take possession of the soul; the work is done, and man and God are one.<br> <b>13. </b>And Philo wrote the seventh:<br> <b>14. </b>A perfect man! To bring before the Triune God a being such as this was nature made.<br> <b>15. </b>This consummation is the highest revelation of the mystery of life.<br> <b>16. </b>When all the essences of carnal things have been transmuted into soul, and all the essences of soul have been returned to Holy Breath, and man is made a perfect God, the drama of Creation will conclude. And this is all.<br> <b>17. </b>And all the sages said, Amen.<br> <b>18. </b>Then Meng-ste said, The Holy One has sent to us a man illumined by the efforts of unnumbered years, to lead the thoughts of men.<br> <b>19. </b>This man, approved by all the master minds of heaven and earth, this man from Galilee, this Jesus, chief of all the sages of the world, we gladly recognise.<br> <b>20. </b>In recognition of this wisdom that he brings to men, we crown him with the Lotus wreath.<br> <b>21. </b>We send him forth with all the blessing of the seven sages of the world.<br> <b>22. </b>Then all the sages laid their hands on Jesus' head, and said with one accord, Praise God!<br> <b>23. </b>For wisdom, honour, glory, power, riches, blessing, strength, are yours, O Christ, for evermore.<br> <b>24. </b>And every living creature said, Amen.<br> <b>25. </b>And then the sages sat in silence seven days.</p>
