 <p></p> <h4>Chapter 52</h4> <i>
 </i><p>Jesus spends forty days in the temple groves. Passes the fifth brotherhood test and receives the fifth degree, HEROISM.<br> <br> <b>1. </b>The sacred temple groves were rich in statues, monuments and shrines; here Jesus loved to walk and meditate.<br> <b>2. </b>And after he had conquered self he talked with nature in these groves for forty days.<br> <b>3. </b>And then the guide took chains and bound him hand and foot; and then cast him into a den of hungry beasts, of unclean birds, and creeping things.<br> <b>4. </b>The den was dark as night; the wild beasts howled; the birds in fury screamed; the reptiles hissed.<br> <b>5. </b>And Jesus said, Who was it that did bind me thus? Why did I meekly sit to be bound down with chains?<br> <b>6. </b>I tell you, none has power to bind a human soul. Of what are fetters made?<br> <b>7. </b>And in his might he rose, and what he thought were chains were only worthless cords that parted at his touch.<br> <b>8. </b>And then he laughed and said, The chains that bind men to the carcasses of earth are forged in fancy's shop; are made of air, and welded in illusion's fires.<br> <b>9. </b>If man will stand erect, and use the power of will, his chains will fall, like worthless rags; for will and faith are stronger than the stoutest chains that men have ever made.<br> <b>10. </b>And Jesus stood erect among the hungry beasts, and birds, and said, What is this darkness that envelops me?<br> <b>11. </b>'Tis but the absence of the light. And what is light? 'Tis but the breath of God vibrating in the rhythm of rapid thought.<br> <b>12. </b>And then he said, Let there be light; and with a mighty will he stirred the ethers up, and their vibrations reached the plane of light; and there was light.<br> <b>13. </b>The darkness of that den of night became the brightness of a newborn day.<br> <b>14. </b>And then he looked to see the beasts, and birds, and creeping things; lo, they were not.<br> <b>15. </b>And Jesus said, Of what are souls afraid? Fear is the chariot in which man rides to death;<br> <b>16. </b>And when he finds himself within the chamber of the dead, he learns that he has been deceived; his chariot was a myth, and death a fancy child.<br> <b>17. </b>But some day all man's lessons will be learned, and from the den of unclean beasts, and birds, and creeping things he will arise to walk in light.<br> <b>18. </b>And Jesus saw a ladder made of gold, on which he climbed, and at the top the white-robed priest awaited him.<br> <b>19. </b>Again he stood before the council bar; again no word was said; again the hierophant reached forth his hand to bless.<br> <b>20. </b>He placed in Jesus' hand another scroll, and on this one was written, HEROISM.<br> <b>21. </b>The Logos had encountered fear and all his phantom host, and in the conflict he achieved the victory.</p>
