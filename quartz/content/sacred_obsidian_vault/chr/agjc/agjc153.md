 </i><p>Jesus heals blind Bartimaeus. With the twelve he goes to Bethany. The multitudes come to welcome him and to speak with Lazarus.<br> <br> <b>1. </b>The Christines started on their way to Bethany, and as they went, while yet in Jericho, they passed a beggar sitting by the way; and he was blind Bartimaeus.<br> <b>2. </b>And when the beggar heard the multitude pass by he said, What is it that I hear?<br> <b>3. </b>The people said to him, Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.<br> <b>4. </b>And instantly the man cried out, Lord Jesus, son of David, stay! have mercy on poor blind Bartimaeus!<br> <b>5. </b>The people said to him, Be quiet; hold your peace.<br> <b>6. </b>But blind Bartimaeus called again, Thou son of David, hear! have mercy on poor blind Bartiaeus!<br> <b>7. </b>And Jesus stopped and said, Bring him to me.<br> <b>8. </b>And then the people brought the blind man to the Lord, and as they brought him up they said, Be cheerful, now, Bartimaeus, the Lord is calling you.<br> <b>9. </b>And then he threw his cloak aside, and ran to Jesus as he waited by the way.<br> <b>10. </b>And Jesus said, What will you have, Bartimaeus?<br> <b>11. </b>The blind man said, Rabboni, open up mine eyes that I may see.<br> <b>12. </b>And Jesus said, Bartimaeus, look up; receive your sight; your faith has made you whole.<br> <b>13. </b>And he at once received his sight, and from the fulness of his heart he said, Praise God.<br> <b>14. </b>And all the people said, Praise God.<br> <b>15. </b>Then Jesus and the twelve went on to Bethany. It was six days before the feast.<br> <b>16. </b>And when the people knew that Jesus was in Bethany they came from near and far to see him and to hear him speak.<br> <b>17. </b>And they were anxious all to talk with Lazarus, whom Jesus had awakened form the dead.<br> <b>18. </b>Now in Jerusalem the priests and Pharisees were all alert; they said, This Jesus will be at the feast, and we must not permit that he shall slip away again.<br> <b>19. </b>And they commanded every man to be alert and help to apprehend the Lord that they might take his life.</p>
