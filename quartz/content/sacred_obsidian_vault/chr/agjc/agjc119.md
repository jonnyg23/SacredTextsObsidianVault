 <p></p> <h4>Chapter 116</h4> <i>
 </i><p>The Christines are in Philip's home. Jesus interprets the parable of the wheat and tares. He explains the unfoldment of the kingdom by parables: the good seed; the growth of the tree; the leaven; the hidden treasure. He goes to a mountain to pray.<br> <br> <b>1. </b>The Christines were in Philip's home and Peter said to Jesus, Lord, will you explain to us the meaning of the parables you spoke to-day? The one about the wheat and tares, especially?<br> <b>2. </b>And Jesus said, God's kingdom is a duality; it has an outer and an inner form.<br> <b>3. </b>As seen by man it is composed of men, of those who make confession of the name of Christ.<br> <b>4. </b>For various reasons various people crowd this outer kingdom of our God.<br> <b>5. </b>The inner kingdom is the kingdom of the soul, the kingdom of the pure in heart.<br> <b>6. </b>The outer kingdom I may well explain in parables. Behold, for I have seen you cast a great net out into the sea,<br> <b>7. </b>And when you hauled it in, lo, it was full of every kind of fish, some good, some bad, some great, some small; and I have seen you save the good and throw the bad away.<br> <b>8. </b>This outer kingdom is the net, and every kind of man is caught; but in the sorting day the bad will all be cast away, the good reserved.<br> <b>9. </b>Hear, then, the meaning of the parable of the wheat and tares:<br> <b>10. </b>The sower is the son of man; the field, the world; the good seed are the children of the light; the tares, the children of the dark; the enemy, the carnal self; the harvest day, the closing of the age; the reapers are the messengers of God.<br> <b>11. </b>The reckoning day will come to every man; then will the tares be gathered up, and cast into the fire and be burned.<br> <b>12. </b>Then will the good shine forth as suns in the kingdom of the soul.<br> <b>13. </b>And Philip said, Must men and women suffer in the flames because they have not found the way of life?<br> <b>14. </b>And Jesus said, The fire purifies. The chemist throws into the fire the ores that hold all kinds of dross.<br> <b>15. </b>The useless metal seems to be consumed; but not a grain of gold is lost.<br> <b>16. </b>There is no man that has not in him gold that cannot be destroyed. The evil things of men are all consumed in fire; the gold survives.<br> <b>17. </b>The inner kingdom of the soul I may explain in parables:<br> <b>18. </b>The son of man goes forth and scatters seeds of truth; God waters well the soil; the seeds show life and grow; first comes the blade, and then the stalk, and then the ear, and then the full wheat in the ear.<br> <b>19. </b>The harvest comes and, lo, the reapers bear the ripened sheaves into the garner of the Lord.<br> <b>20. </b>Again, this kingdom of the soul is like a little seed that men may plant in fertile soil.<br> <b>21. </b>(A thousand of these seeds would scarcely be a shekel's weight.)<br> <b>22. </b>The tiny seed begins to grow; it pushes through the earth, and after years of growth it is a mighty tree and birds rest in its leafy bowers and men find refuge 'neath its sheltering boughs from sun and storm.<br> <b>23. </b>Again, the truth, the spirit of the kingdom of the soul, is like a ball of leaven that a woman hid in measures, three, of flour and in a little time the whole was leavened.<br> <b>24. </b>Again, the kingdom of the soul is like a treasure hidden in a field which one has found, and straightway goes his way and sells all that he has and buys the field.<br> <b>25. </b>When Jesus had thus said he went alone into a mountain pass near by to pray.</p>
