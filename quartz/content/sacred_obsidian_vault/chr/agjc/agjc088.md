 <p></p> <h4>Chapter 85</h4> <i>
 </i><p>John, the harbinger, censures Herod for his wickedness. Herod sends him to prison in Machaerus. Jesus tells why God permitted the imprisonment of John.<br> <br> <b>1. </b>Herod Antipas, the tetrarch of Paraca and of Galilee was dissipated, selfish and tyrannical.<br> <b>2. </b>He drove his wife away from home that he might take as wife Herodias, the wife of one, a near of kin, a woman, like himself, immoral and unjust.<br> <b>3. </b>The city of Tiberius, upon the shores of Galilee, was Herod's home.<br> <b>4. </b>Now John, the harbinger, had left the Salim Springs to teach the people by the sea of Galilee; and he rebuked the wicked ruler and his stolen wife for all their sins.<br> <b>5. </b>Herodias was enraged because the preacher dared accuse her and her husband of their crimes;<br> <b>6. </b>And she prevailed on Herod to arrest the harbinger and cast him in a dungeon in the castle of Machaerus that stood beside the Bitter Sea.<br> <b>7. </b>And Herod did as she required; then she lived in peace in all her sins, for none were bold enough to censure her again.<br> <b>8. </b>The followers of John were warned to speak not of the trial and imprisonment of John.<br> <b>9. </b>By order of the court, they were restrained from teaching in the public halls.<br> <b>10. </b>They could not talk about this better life that Herod called the Heresy of John.<br> <b>11. </b>When it was known that John had been imprisoned by the tetrarch court, the friends of Jesus thought it best that he should not remain in Galilee.<br> <b>12. </b>But Jesus said, I have no need of fear; my time has not yet come; no man can stay me till my work is done.<br> <b>13. </b>And when they asked why God permitted Herod to imprison John, he said,<br> <b>14. </b>Behold yon stalk of grain to perfectness, it is of no more worth; it falls, becoming part of earth again from which it came.<br> <b>15. </b>John is a stalk of golden wheat; he brought unto maturity the richest grain of all the earth; his work is done.<br> <b>16. </b>If he had said another word it might have marred the symmetry of what is now a noble life.<br> <b>17. </b>And when my work is done the rulers will do unto me what they have done to John, and more.<br> <b>18. </b>All these events are part of God's own plan. The innocent will suffer while the wicked are in power; but woe to them who cause the suffering of the innocents.</p>
