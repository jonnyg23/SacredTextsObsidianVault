 <p></p> <h4>Chapter 63</h4> <i>
 </i><p>John, the harbinger, visits Jericho. Meets the people at Gilgal. Announces his mission. Introduces the rite of baptism. Baptises many people. Returns to Bethany and teaches. Returns to the Jordan.<br> <br> <b>1. </b>And John went down to Jericho; there he abode with Alpheus.<br> <b>2. </b>And when the people heard that he was there they came in throngs to hear him speak.<br> <b>3. </b>He spoke to none; but when the time was due he went down to the Jordan ford, and to the multitudes he said.<br> <b>4. </b>Reform and in the fount of purity wash all your sins away; the kingdom is at hand.<br> <b>5. </b>Come unto me and in the waters of this stream be washed, symbolic of the inner cleansing of the soul.<br> <b>6. </b>And, lo, the multitudes came down, and in the Jordan they were washed, and every man confessed his sins.<br> <b>7. </b>For many months, in all the regions round about, John pled for purity and righteousness, and after many days he went again to Bethany; and there he taught.<br> <b>8. </b>At first few but the honest seekers came; but, by and by, the selfish and the vicious came with no contrition; came because the many came.<br> <b>9. </b>And when John saw the repentant Pharisees and Sadducees come unto him, he said,<br> <b>10. </b>You children of the vipers, stay; are you disturbed by news of coming wrath?<br> <b>11. </b>Go to, and do the things that prove repentance genuine.<br> <b>12. </b>Is it enough for you to say that you are heirs of Abraham? I tell you, no.<br> <b>13. </b>The heirs of Abraham are just as wicked in the sight of God when they do wrong as any heathen man.<br> <b>14. </b>Behold the axe! and every tree that bears not wholesome fruit is cut down at the roots and cast into the fire.<br> <b>15. </b>And then the people asked, What must we do?<br> <b>16. </b>And John replied, Accept the ministry of helpfulness for all mankind; spend not upon your selfish selves all that you have.<br> <b>17. </b>Let him who has two coats give one to him who has no coat; give part of all the food you have to those in need.<br> <b>18. </b>And when the publicans came up and asked, What must we do? John answered them,<br> <b>19. </b>Be honest in your work; do not increase for selfish gain the tribute you collect; take nothing more than what your king demands.<br> <b>20. </b>And when the soldiers came and asked, What must we do? The harbinger replied,<br> <b>21. </b>Do violence to none; exact no wrongful thing, and be contented with the wages you receive.<br> <b>22. </b>Among the Jews were many who had been waiting for the Christ to come, and they regarded John as Christ.<br> <b>23. </b>But to their questions John replied, In water I do cleanse, symbolic of the cleansing of the soul; but when he comes who is to come, lo, he will cleanse in Holy Breath and purify in fire.<br> <b>24. </b>His fan is in his hand, and he will separate the wheat and chaff; will throw the chaff away, but garner every grain of wheat. This is the Christ.<br> <b>25. </b>Behold he comes! and he will walk with you, and you will know him not.<br> <b>26. </b>He is the king; the latchet of his shoes I am not worthy to unloose.<br> <b>27. </b>And John left Bethany and went again unto the Jordan ford.</p>
