 <p></p> <h4>Chapter 55</h4> <i>
 </i><p>Jesus passes the seventh brotherhood test, and in the purple room of the temple receives the seventh, the highest degree, THE CHRIST. He leaves the temple a conqueror.<br> <br> <b>1. </b>The work of Jesus in the Chamber of the Dead was done, and in the temple purple room he stood before the hierophant,<br> <b>2. </b>And he was clothed in purple robes; and all the brothers stood. The hierophant arose and said,<br> <b>3. </b>This is a royal day for all the hosts of Israel. In honour of their chosen son we celebrate the great Passover Feast.<br> <b>4. </b>And then he said to Jesus, Brother, man, most excellent of men, in all the temple tests you have won out.<br> <b>5. </b>Six times before the bar of right you have been judged; six times you have received the highest honours man can give; and now you stand prepared to take the last degree.<br> <b>6. </b>Upon your brow I place this diadem, and in the Great Lodge of the heavens and earth you are THE CHRIST.<br> <b>7. </b>This is your Passover rite. You are a neophyte no more; but now a master mind.<br> <b>8. </b>Now, man can do no more; but God himself will speak, and will confirm your title and degree.<br> <b>9. </b>Go on your way, for you must preach the gospel of good will to men and peace on earth; must open up the prison doors and set the captives free.<br> <b>10. </b>And while the hierophant yet spoke the temple bells rang out; a pure white dove descended from above and sat on Jesus' head.<br> <b>11. </b>And then a voice that shook the very temple said, THIS IS THE CHRIST; and every living creature said, AMEN.<br> <b>12. </b>The great doors of the temple swung ajar; the Logos journeyed on his way a conqueror.</p>
