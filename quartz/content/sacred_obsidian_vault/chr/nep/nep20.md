 <font size="6"><p>H</p></font>USH, my dear; lie still and slumber<br>
   Holy angels guard thy bed;<br>
 Heavenly blessings, without number,<br>
   Gently falling on thy head.
 <p>Sleep, my babe! Thy food and raiment,<br>
   House and home, thy friends provide,<br>
 All without thy care or payment;<br>
   All thy wants are well supplied.</p>
 <p>How much better thou'rt attended<br>
   Than the Son of God could be,<br>
 When from heaven he descended,<br>
   And became a child like thee!</p>
 <p>Soft and easy is thy cradle;<br>
   Coarse and hard thy Savior lay,<br>
 When his birthplace was a stable,<br>
   And his softest bed was hay.</p>
 <p>Blessed Babe! what glorious features.<br>
   Spotless, fair, divinely bright! <a name="page_22"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 22</font></a><br>
 Must he dwell with brutal creatures?<br>
   How could angels bear the sight?</p>
 <p>Was there nothing but a manger<br>
   Cursed sinners could afford<br>
 To receive the heavenly Stranger?<br>
   Did they thus affront the Lord?</p>
 <p>Soft, my child! I did not chide thee,<br>
   Though my song may sound too hard<br>
 'Tis thy mother sits beside thee,<br>
   And her arms shall be thy guard.</p>
 <p>Yet to read the shameful story,<br>
   How the Jews abused their King,<br>
 How they served the Lord of glory,<br>
   Makes me angry while I sing.</p>
 <p>See the kinder shepherds round him,<br>
   Telling wonders from the sky;<br>
 There they sought him, there they found him,<br>
   With his virgin mother by.</p>
 <p>See the lovely Babe a-dressing--<br>
   Lovely Infant! how he smiled!<br>
 When he wept, his mother's blessing<br>
   Soothed and hushed the holy Child.</p>
 <p>Lo! he slumbers in a manger,<br>
   Where the horned oxen fed<br>
 Peace, my darling! here's no danger<br>
   Here's no oxen near thy bed.</p>
 <p>'Twas to save thee, child, from dying,<br>
   Save my dear from burning flame,<br>
 Bitter groans and endless crying,<br>
   That thy blest Redeemer came.</p>
 <p>May'st thou live to know and fear him,<br>
   Trust and love him, all thy days; <a name="page_23"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 23</font></a><br>
 Then go dwell forever near him,<br>
   See his face, and sing his praise.</p>
 <p>I could give thee thousand kisses,<br>
   Hoping what I most desire;<br>
 Not a mother's fondest wishes<br>
   Can to greater joy aspire.</p></dir>

 <p>O GREAT Almighty God above,<br>
 Plant in my breast a fund of love,<br>
 That I thy mercies may adore,<br>
 And bless and praise thee evermore.</p></dir>

 <p>THE boy that's to his book inclined<br>
 Will soon a golden treasure find.</p></dir>
