 This was a standard reader in New England in the 18th and 19th centuries.
 It was apparently used in both public and Sunday (religious) schools.
 At that time children of all ages
 <a href="nep01.htm">studied in the same classroom</a>, so it
 has portions oriented towards younger and older students.
 </p>
 <p>
 Besides <a href="nep06.htm">instruction in the alphabet</a>,
 the <cite>New England Primer</cite>
 also served to indoctrinate young
 minds in the stern and <a href="nep12.htm">somewhat morbid</a>
 Protestantism of that time and place.
 Depending on your viewpoint, it is either yet another
 example of how religion has been excised from the public schools
 in the United States,
 or a quaint sample of what our forefathers considered acceptable 
 as 'moral education'.</p>
 <p>
 The <cite>New England Primer</cite> also has examples of
 religious intolerance, specifically anti-Catholic and anti-Semitic
 statements, which reflect then-contemporary attitudes.
 </p>
 <p>This particular book went through a number of editions.
 This version was scanned from an copy in the possession
 of my family which was published in 1843.
 An earlier version, dated 1777, is also available
 <a href="1777/index.htm">here</a>.
