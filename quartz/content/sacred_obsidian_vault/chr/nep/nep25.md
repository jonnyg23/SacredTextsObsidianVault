 <font size="5"><p align="CENTER">A DIALOGUE</p>
 </font><font size="1"><p align="CENTER">BETWEEN</p>
 </font><font size="5"><p align="CENTER">CHRIST, A YOUTH, AND THE DEVIL.</p>
 </font><p align="CENTER">YOUTH.</p>
 <font size="5"><p>T</p></font>HOSE days which God to me doth send,<br>
 In pleasure I'm resolved to spend;<br>
 Like as the birds, in lovely spring,<br>
 Sit chirping on the bonghs, and sing,--<a name="page_55"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 55</font></a><br>
 Who, straining forth thns. warbling notes,<br>
 Do make sweet music in their throats,--<br>
 So I resolve, in this my prime,<br>
 In sports and plays to spend my time.<br>
 Sorrow and grief I'll put away;<br>
 Such things agree not with my day.<br>
 From clouds my morning shall be free,<br>
 And nought on earth shall trouble me.<br>
 I will embrace each sweet delight<br>
 This earth affords me, day and night;<br>
 Though parents grieve, and me correct,<br>
 Yet I their counsel will reject.
 <p align="CENTER">DEVIL.</p>
 <p>The resolution which you take,<br>
 Sweet Youth, it doth me merry make.<br>
 If thou my counsel wilt embrace,<br>
 And shun the ways of truth and grace<br>
 And learn to lie, to curse, and swear.<br>
 And be as proud as any are,<br>
 And with thy brothers wilt fall out,<br>
 And sisters with vile language flout,<br>
 Yea, fight and scratch, and also bite,<br>
 Then I in thee will take delight.<br>
 If thou wilt but be ruled by me,<br>
 An artist thou shalt quickly be<br>
 In all my ways, which lovely are;<br>
 There's few with thee who shall compare.<br>
 Thy parents always disobey;<br>
 Don't mind at all what they do say;<br>
 And also proud and sullen be,<br>
 And thou shalt be a child for me.<br>
 When others read, be thou at play<br>
 Think not on God; don't mind to pray,<br>
 Nor be thou such a silly fool<br>
 To mind thy book, or go to school,<br>
 But play the truant; fear not. I<br>
 Will straightway help thee to a lie,<a name="page_56"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 56</font></a><br>
 Which will excuse thee for the same,<br>
 From being whipped, and from all blame.<br>
 Come, bow to me; uphold my crown;<br>
 And I'll thee raise to high renown</p>
 <p align="CENTER">YOUTH.</p>
 <p>These notions I will cleave unto,<br>
 And let all other counsel go.<br>
 My heart against my parents now<br>
 Shall hardened be, and will not bow<br>
 I won't submit at all to them,<br>
 But all good counsel will contemn;<br>
 And what I list that do will I,<br>
 And stubborn be continually.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">CHRIST.</p>
 <p>Wilt thou, O Youth, make such a choice<br>
 And thus obey the Devil's voice?<br>
 Cursed, sinful ways wilt thou embrace,<br>
 And hate the ways of truth and grace?<br>
 Wilt thou to me a rebel prove,<br>
 And from thy parents quite remove<br>
 Thy heart also? then shalt thou see<br>
 What will ere long become of thee.<br>
 Come, think on God, who did thee make,<br>
 And at his presence dread and quake<br>
 Remember him now in thy youth,<br>
 And let thy soul take hold on truth<br>
 The devil and his ways defy;<br>
 Believe him not; he doth but lie<br>
 His ways seem sweet, but, Youth, beware;<br>
 He for thy soul hath laid a snare.<br>
 His sweet will unto bitter turn;<br>
 If in those ways thou still wilt run,<br>
 He will thee into pieces tear,<br>
 Like lions which most hungry, are.<br>
 Grant me thy heart, thy folly leave,<br>
 And from this lion I'll thee save; <a name="page_57"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 57</font></a><br>
 And thou shalt have sweet joy from me,<br>
 Which will last to eternity.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">YOUTH.</p>
 <p>My heart shall cheer me in my youth<br>
 I'll have my frolics in good truth:<br>
 Whate'er seems lovely in mine eye,<br>
 Myself I cannot it deny.<br>
 In mine own ways I still will walk,<br>
 And take delight among young folk<br>
 Who spend their days in joy and mirth!<br>
 Nothing like that while I'm on earth!<br>
 Thy ways, O Christ, are not for me<br>
 They with my age do not agree:<br>
 If I unto thy laws should cleave,<br>
 No more good days then should I have.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">CHRIST.</p>
 <p>Wouldst thou live long, and good days see<br>
 Refrain from all iniquity;<br>
 True good alone from me doth flow;<br>
 It can't be had in things below.<br>
 Are not my ways, O Youth, for thee<br>
 Then thou shalt never happy be;<br>
 Nor ever shall thy soul obtain<br>
 True good, whilst thou dost here remain</p>
 <p align="CENTER">YOUTH.</p>
 <p>To thee O Christ, I'll not adhere<br>
 What thou speakst of does not appear<br>
 Lovely to me: I cannot find<br>
 'Tis good to set or place my rnind<br>
 On ways whence many sorrows spring.<br>
 And to the flesh such crosses bring.<br>
 Don't trouble me; I must fulfil<br>
 My fleshly mind, and have my will</p>
 <p><a name="page_58"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 58</font></a></p>
 <p align="CENTER">CHRIST.</p>
 <p>Unto thyself, then, I'll thee leave,<br>
 That Satan may thee wholly have;<br>
 Thy heart in sin shall hardened be,<br>
 And blinded in iniquity!<br>
 And then in wrath I'll cut thee down,<br>
 Like as the grass and flowers are mown<br>
 And, to thy woe, thou shalt espy<br>
 Childhood and youth are vanity:<br>
 For all such things I'll make thee know<br>
 To judgment thou shalt come also<br>
 In hell at last thy soul must burn,<br>
 When thou thy sinful race hast run.<br>
 Consider this; think on thy end,<br>
 Lest God do thee in pieces rend.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">YOUTH.</p>
 <p>Amazed, Lord, I now begin;<br>
 O help me, and I'll leave my sin<br>
 I tremble and do greatly fear<br>
 To think upon what I do hear.<br>
 Lord, I religious now will be,<br>
 And I'll from Satan turn to thee.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">DEVIL.</p>
 <p>Nay, foolish Youth, don't change thy mind;<br>
 Unto such thoughts be not inclined.<br>
 Come, cheer thy heart, rouse up, be glad;<br>
 There is no hell; why art thou sad!<br>
 Eat, drink, be merry with thy friend;<br>
 For when thou diest, that's thy end.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">YOUTH.</p>
 <p>Such thoughts as these I can't receive,<br>
 Because God's word I do believe,<br>
 None shall in this destroy my faith;<br>
 Nor do I mind what Satan saith.</p>
 <p><a name="page_59"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 59</font></a></p>
 <p align="CENTER">DEVIL.</p>
 <p>Although to thee herein I yield,<br>
 Yet I ere long shall win the field.<br>
 That thcre's a heaven I can't deny,<br>
 Yea, and a hell of misery;<br>
 That heaven is a lovely place<br>
 I can't deny,--'tis a clear case,--<br>
 And easy it is to come there;<br>
 Therefore take thou no further care<br>
 All human laws do thou observe,<br>
 And from old customs never swerve;<br>
 Do not oppose what great men say,<br>
 And thou shalt never go astray;<br>
 Thou mayst be drunk, and swear, and curse<br>
 And sinners like thee ne'er the worse;<br>
 At any time thou mayst repent,<br>
 'Twill serve when all thy days are spent.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">CHRIST.</p>
 <p>Take heed, or else thou art undone.<br>
 These thoughts are from the wicked one<br>
 Narrow's the way that leads to life;<br>
 Who walk therein do meet with strife.<br>
 Few Shall be saved, as thou shalt know,<br>
 But many to destruction go.<br>
 If righteous ones scarce saved be,<br>
 What will at last become of thee?<br>
 Oh! don't neglect my precious call<br>
 Lest suddenly in hell thou fall:<br>
 Unless that thou converted be,<br>
 God's kingdom thou shalt never see.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">YOUTH.</p>
 <p>Lord, I am now at a great stand;<br>
 If I should yield to thy command,<br>
 My comrades would me much deride<br>
 And never more with me abide; <a name="page_60"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 60</font></a><br>
 Moreover, this I also know--<br>
 Thou canst at last great mercy show.<br>
 When I am old, and pleasure's gone,<br>
 Then what thou sayst, I'll think upon.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">CHRIST.</p>
 <p>Nay, hold, vain youth; thy time is short<br>
 I'll have thy breath; I'll end thy sport!<br>
 Thou shalt not live till thou art old,<br>
 Since thou in sin art grown so bold;<br>
 I, in thy youth, grim Death will send.<br>
 And all thy sports put to an end</p>
 <p align="CENTER">YOUTH.</p>
 <p>I am too young, alas! to die<br>
 Let Death some old gray head espy.<br>
 O, spare me, and I will amend,<br>
 And with thy grace my soul befriend;<br>
 Or else I am undone: alas!<br>
 For I am in a woful case.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">CHRIST.</p>
 <p>When I did call, thou wouldst not hear<br>
 But didst to me turn a deaf ear;<br>
 And now, in thy calamity.<br>
 I will not mind nor bear thy cry.<br>
 Thy day is past; begone from me,<br>
 Thou, who didst love iniquity<br>
 Above thy soul, or Savior dear,<br>
 Who on the cross great pain did bear.<br>
 My mercies thou didst much abuse<br>
 And all good counsel didst refuse: <br>
 Justice will therefore vengeance take,<br>
 And thee a sad example make.</p>
 <p>YOUTH.</p>
 <p>O, spare me, Lord; forbear thy hand<br>
 Don't cut me off, who trembling stand <a name="page_61"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 61</font></a><br>
 Belging for mercy at thy door;<br>
 O, let me live but one year more!</p>
 <p align="CENTER">CHRIST.</p>
 <p>If thou some longer time shouldst live<br>
 Thou wouldst again to folly cleave;<br>
 Therefore, to thee I will not give<br>
 One day on earth longer to live.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">DEATH.</p>
 <p>Youth, I am come to take thy breath,<br>
 And carry thee to shades of death:<br>
 No pity to thee I can show,<br>
 Thou hast thy God offended so.<br>
 Thy soul and body I'll divide;<br>
 Thy body in the grave I'll hide,<br>
 And thy dear soul in hell must lie,<br>
 With devils, to eternity.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">------------</p>
 <p>Thus end the days of wicked youth,<br>
 Who won't obey nor mind the truth,<br>
 Nor hearken to what preachers say,<br>
 But do their parents disobey.<br>
 They in their youth go down to hell,<br>
 Under eternal wrath to dwell,<br>
 And do not live out half their days,<br>
 For cleaving unto sinful ways.</p>
