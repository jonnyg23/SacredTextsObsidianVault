 <p><a name="xx.i-p4"></a><b>2 </b>And he hath placed nay mouth like a sharp sword; In the shadow of his hand he hath protected me, And hath placed me as a polished arrow; in his quiver hath he hid me;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xx.i-p5"></a><b>3 </b>And said to me, Thou art my servant, O Israel! In thee will I he glorified.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xx.i-p6"></a><b>4 </b>But I said, In vain have I toiled; Uselessly And unprofitably have I exhausted my strength; and my judgment is before Jehovah; And my work before my God.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xx.i-p7"></a><b>5 </b>And now saith Jehovah, Who formed me from the womb to be his servant, That I may bring back Jacob to him: And though Israel be not gathered, Yet I shall be glorious in the eyes of Jehovah, And my God shall be my strength.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xx.i-p8"></a><b>6 </b>And he saith, It is a light thing that thou shouldst be my servant, To raise up the tribes of Jacob, And that thou shouldst restore the desolations of Israel; Therefore have I appointed thee to be a light of the Gentiles, That thou mayest be my salvation to the end of the earth.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xx.i-p9"></a><b>7 </b>Thus saith Jehovah, The Redeemer of Israel, His Holy One, To the contemptible in the soul, To the abhorred nation, To the servant of rulers; Kings shall see, And princes shall arise, And shall worship for the sake of Jehovah; For faithful is the Holy One of Israel, who hath chosen thee.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xx.i-p10"></a><b>8 </b>Thus saith Jehovah, In a time of good-pleasure have I listened to thee; In the day of salvation have I assisted thee; And I will preserve thee. And give thee for a covenant of the people, That thou mayest raise up the earth, That thou mayest possess by inheritance the desolate heritages;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xx.i-p11"></a><b>9 </b>That thou mayest say to them that are bound, Go forth! To them that are in darkness, Show yourselves. On the ways they shall feed; On all the high places shall be their pastures.</p>
