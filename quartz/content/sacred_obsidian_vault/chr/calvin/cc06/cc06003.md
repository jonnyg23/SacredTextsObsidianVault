 <p><a name="ii.ii-p18"></a><b>17.</b> <i>And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle.</i> Moses before informed us that the tabernacle was so distinguished by a visible miracle, that God made it manifest that He dwelt there: not that He left heaven and removed to that earthly house, but in order to be nigh to His people 			 by the presence of His power and grace, whenever He was invoked by them. He now reports another miracle, that God, by uplifting the cloud, gave a sign, as it were, by which He commanded them to strike the camp; and when the cloud rested on the tabernacle, it was a sign that they should abide where they were. Here, however, a question arises; since it has been already said that, immediately after their departure from Egypt, the cloud was like a banner to direct the march of the people, it 			 follows that they were not now for the first time admonished by its being lifted up to collect their baggage, and ordered as it were to advance. The answer is easy, that the people were indeed previously directed by the sight of the cloud, as we have seen; but that here a new fact is related, viz., that since the tabernacle was set up, the cloud, which hitherto was suspended in the air and went before the camp, now settled on the sanctuary: for a fresh acquisition of grace is here proclaimed by 			 the more certain and conspicuous sign, as if God showed himself more closely and familiarly as the leader of the people. Although, therefore, the cloud had been the director of their march from its very commencement, yet it more fully illustrated the glory of the tabernacle when it proceeded from thence.</p>

  			  The <i>mouth </i>is here used by metonymy for the speech; nor does there appear to me to be so much harshness in the Hebraism, but that it may be appropriately retained. But it is asked whether God actually spoke or not; for the word <i>mouth </i>is often repeated. It is indeed likely that Moses was instructed but <i>once </i>what was meant by the removal or remaining of the cloud; yet I doubt not but that the name of <i>word, </i>or <i>commandment, </i>was given to the sign, inasmuch as God speaks as much to the eyes by outward signs as He does to the ears by His voice. Still, from this mode of expression we may gather that the use of signs   			  <a name="fr_2"></a><a href="#fn_2"><font size="1">3</font></a>
  			  is perverted and nullified, unless they are taken to be visible doctrine, as Augustin writes. The repetition, which certainly has no little force, shows how worthy this is of observation.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.ii-p23"></a><a name="ii.ii-p23.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.ii-p24"></a><b>19.</b> <i>Then the children kept the charge of the Lord.</i> Some,   			  <a name="fr_3"></a><a href="#fn_3"><font size="1">4</font></a>
  			  in my opinion, extend this too far, thinking that when the cloud tarried, the children of Israel, being as it were at leisure, employed themselves in the worship of God; but I restrict it rather to that heedfulness which is then praised at some length. To keep the charge <i>(custodiam,) </i>then, is equivalent to regarding the will of God with the greatest earnestness and care. For, when the cloud had begun to rest in any 			 place, the people knew that they were to remain there; but if on the next day they were not attentive, the cloud might vanish, and thus their neglect and carelessness might deprive them of this incomparable advantage.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.ii-p26"></a>To this end it is said immediately afterwards that, If for one day, or more, or even for a month, or a year, the cloud stood still, the people was, as it were, tied to the spot. The old interpreter  			  <a name="fr_4"></a><a href="#fn_4"><font size="1">5</font></a>
  			 has not badly rendered it, “The children of Israel were upon the watch;” since day and night they anxiously expected the time when God would command them to move forward. The last verse of the chapter confirms this sense, where it is again added, that “they kept the charge of the Lord at His mouth by the hand of Moses:” whence it appears that Moses was God’s interpreter, so that they might set forth on their march whenever the cloud being lifted up pointed out to them the way. Nor can 			 it be doubted but that it preceded them; so that they might know in what direction God would have them proceed, and whither they were to go. Moreover, it must be observed that in both respects it is counted worthy of praise in the people, that they should either journey, or continue where they were, at God’s command. Thus is that absurd activity condemned which engages itself in endless work; as if men could only obey God by turmoil. Whereas it is sometimes no less a virtue to rest, when it so 			 pleases God.  			  <a name="fr_5"></a><a href="#fn_5"><font size="1">6</font></a>
