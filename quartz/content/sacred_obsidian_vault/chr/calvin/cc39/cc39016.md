 <p class="Normal"><a name="xvii.i-p13"></a><a name="xvii.i-p13.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.i-p14"></a>What he had previously taught by two similitudes, he now confirms by examples. The Corinthians grew wanton, and gloried, as if they had served out their time,   			  <a name="fr_519"></a><a href="#fn_519"><font size="1">520</font></a>
  			  or at least had finished their course, when they had scarcely left the starting-point. This vain exultation and confidence he represses in this manner — “As I see that you are quietly taking your ease at the very outset of your course, <i>I would not have you ignorant</i> of what befell the people of Israel in consequence of this, that their example may 			 arouse you.” As, however, on examples being adduced, any point of difference destroys the force of the comparison, Paul premises, that there is no such dissimilarity between us and the Israelites, as to make our condition different from theirs. Having it, therefore, in view to threaten the Corinthians with the same vengeance as had overtaken them, he begins in this manner — “Beware of glorying in any peculiar privilege, as if you were in higher esteem than they were in the sight of God.” For 			 they were favored with the same benefits as we at this day enjoy; there was a Church of God among them, as there is at this day among us; they had the same sacraments, to be tokens to them of the grace of God;   			  <a name="fr_520"></a><a href="#fn_520"><font size="1">521</font></a>
  			  but, on their abusing their privileges, they did not escape the judgment of God.   			  <a name="fr_521"></a><a href="#fn_521"><font size="1">522</font></a>
  			  Be afraid, therefore; for the same thing is impending over <i>you</i>. Jude makes use of the same argument in his Epistle. (<a name="xvii.i-p17.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#005">Jude 1:5</a><a name="xvii.i-p17.2"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.i-p18"></a>1. <i>All were under the cloud.</i> The Apostle’s object is to show, that the Israelites were no less the people of God than we are, that we may know, that we will not escape with impunity the hand of God, which punished them   			  <a name="fr_522"></a><a href="#fn_522"><font size="1">523</font></a>
  			  with so much severity. For the sum is this — “If God spared not them, neither will he spare you, for your condition is similar.” That similarity he proves from this — that they had been honored with the same tokens of God’s grace, for the sacraments are badges by which the Church of God is distinguished. He treats first of baptism, and teaches that the cloud, which protected the Israelites in the desert from the heat of the sun, and directed their course, and also 			 their passage through the sea, was to them as a baptism; he says, also, that in the manna, and the water flowing from the rock, there was a sacrament which corresponded with the sacred Supper.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.i-p20"></a>They were, says he, <i>baptized in Moses</i>, that is, under the ministry or guidance of Moses. For I take the particle <a name="xvii.i-p20.1"></a>εἰς to be used here instead of <a name="xvii.i-p20.2"></a>ἐν, agreeably to the common usage of Scripture, because we are assuredly baptized in the name of Christ, and not of any mere man, as he has stated in <a name="xvii.i-p20.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#013">1Co 1:13</a><a name="xvii.i-p20.3"></a>, and that for two reasons. These are, <i>first</i>, because we are by baptism initiated   			  <a name="fr_523"></a><a href="#fn_523"><font size="1">524</font></a>
  			  into the doctrine of Christ alone; and, <i>secondly</i>, because his name alone is invoked, inasmuch as baptism is founded on his influence alone. They were, therefore, <i>baptized in Moses</i>, that is, under his guidance or ministry, as has 			 been already stated. How? <i>In the cloud and in the sea.</i> “They were, then, baptized twice,” some one will say. I answer, that there are <i>two </i>signs made mention of, making, however, but <i>one </i>baptism, corresponding to ours.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.i-p22"></a>Here, however, a more difficult question presents itself. For it is certain, that the advantage of those gifts, which Paul makes mention of, was temporal.   			  <a name="fr_524"></a><a href="#fn_524"><font size="1">525</font></a>
  			  The <i>cloud</i> protected them from the heat of the sun, and showed them the way: these are outward advantages of the present life. In like manner, their passage through the <i>sea</i> was attended with this effect, that they got clear off from 			 Pharaoh’s cruelty, and escaped from imminent hazard of death. The advantage of <i>our </i>baptism, on the other hand, is spiritual. Why then does Paul turn earthly benefits into sacraments, and seek to find some spiritual mystery   			  <a name="fr_525"></a><a href="#fn_525"><font size="1">526</font></a>
  			  in them? I answer, that it was not without good reason that Paul sought in miracles of this nature something more than the mere outward advantage of the flesh. For, though God designed to promote his people’s advantage in respect of the present life, what he had mainly in view was, to declare and manifest himself to be their God, and under <i>that</i>, eternal salvation is 			 comprehended.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.i-p25"></a>The <i>cloud</i>, in various instances,   			  <a name="fr_526"></a><a href="#fn_526"><font size="1">527</font></a>
  			  is called the symbol of his presence. As, therefore, he declared by means of it, that he was present with them, as his peculiar and chosen people, there can be no doubt that, in addition to an earthly advantage, they had in it, besides, a token of spiritual life. Thus its use was twofold, as was also that of the passage through the sea, for a way was opened up for them through the midst of the sea, that they might escape from the hand of Pharaoh; but to what was 			 this owing, but to the circumstance, that the Lord, having taken them under his guardianship and protection, determined by every means to defend them? Hence, they concluded from this, that they were the objects of God’s care, and that he had their salvation in charge. Hence, too, the Passover, which was instituted to celebrate the remembrance of their deliverance, was nevertheless, at the same time, a sacrament of Christ. How so? Because God 			 had, under a temporal benefit, manifested himself as a Savior. Any one that will attentively consider these things, will find that there is no absurdity in Paul’s words. Nay more, he will perceive both in the spiritual substance and in the visible sign a most striking correspondence between the baptism of the Jews, and ours.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.i-p27"></a>It is however objected again, that we do not find a word of all this.  			  <a name="fr_527"></a><a href="#fn_527"><font size="1">528</font></a>
  			 This I admit, but there is no doubt, that God by his Spirit supplied the want of outward preaching, as we may see in the instance of the brazen serpent, which was, as Christ himself testifies, a spiritual sacrament, (<a name="xvii.i-p28.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#014">Joh 3:14</a><a name="xvii.i-p28.2"></a>,) and yet not a word has come down to us as to this thing,  			  <a name="fr_528"></a><a href="#fn_528"><font size="1">529</font></a>
  			 but the Lord revealed to believers of that age, in the manner he thought fit, the secret, which would otherwise have remained hid.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xvii.i-p30"></a><a name="xvii.i-p30.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.i-p31"></a><b>3.</b> <i>The same spiritual meat</i>  He now makes mention of the other sacrament, which corresponds to the Holy Supper of the Lord. “The manna,” says he, “and the water 			 that flowed forth from the rock, served not merely for the food of the body, but also for the spiritual nourishment of souls.” It is true, that both were means of sustenance for the body, but this does not hinder their serving also another purpose. While, therefore, the Lord relieved the necessities of the body, he, at the same time, provided for the everlasting welfare of souls. These two things would be easily reconciled, were there not a 			 difficulty presented in Christ’s words, (<a name="xvii.i-p31.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#031">Joh 6:31</a><a name="xvii.i-p31.1"></a>,) where he makes the manna the corruptible food of the belly, which he contrasts with the true food of the soul. That statement appears to differ widely from what Paul says here. This knot, too, is easily solved. It is the manner of scripture, when treating of the sacraments, or other things, to speak in some cases according to the 			 capacity of the hearers, and in that case it has respect not to the nature of the thing, but to the mistaken idea of the hearers. Thus, Paul does not always speak of circumcision in the same way, for when he has a view to the appointment of God in it, he says, that it was <i>a seal of the righteousness of the faith</i>, (<a name="xvii.i-p31.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#011">Ro 4:11</a><a name="xvii.i-p31.2"></a>,) but when he is disputing with those who gloried in an outward and bare sign, and reposed in it a mistaken confidence of salvation, he says, that it is a token of condemnation, because men bind themselves by it <i>to keep the whole law</i>  (<a name="xvii.i-p31.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#002">Gal. 5:2</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#003">3</a><a name="xvii.i-p31.3"></a>.) For he takes merely the opinion that the false apostles had of it, because he contends, not against the pure institution of God, but against their mistaken view. In this way, as the carnal multitude preferred Moses to Christ, because he had fed the people in the desert for forty years, and looked to nothing in the manna but the food of the belly, (as indeed they sought nothing else,) 			 Christ in his reply does not explain what was meant by the manna, but, passing over everything else, suits his discourse to the idea entertained by his hearers. “Moses is held by you in the highest esteem, and even in admiration, as a most eminent Prophet, because he filled the bellies of your fathers in the desert. For this one thing you object against me: I am accounted nothing by you, because I do not supply you with food for the belly. But if you reckon corruptible food of so much 			 importance, what ought you to think of the life-giving bread, with which souls are nourished up unto eternal life?.” We see then that the Lord speaks there — not according to the nature of the thing, but rather according to the apprehension of his hearers.   			  <a name="fr_529"></a><a href="#fn_529"><font size="1">530</font></a>
  			  Paul, on the other hand, looks here — not to the ordinance of God, but to the abuse of it by the wicked.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.i-p33"></a>Farther, when he says that the fathers ate <i>the same spiritual meat,</i> he shows, <i>first</i>, what is the virtue and efficacy of the Sacraments, and, <i>secondly</i>, he declares, that the ancient Sacraments of the Law had the same virtue as ours have at this day. For, if the manna was spiritual food, it follows, that it is not bare emblems that are presented to us in the Sacraments, but that the thing represented is at the same time truly imparted, for God is not a deceiver to feed us with empty fancies.   			  <a name="fr_530"></a><a href="#fn_530"><font size="1">531</font></a>
  			  A sign, it is true, <i>is </i>a sign, and retains its essence, but, as Papists act a ridiculous part, who dream of transformations, (I know not of what sort,) so it is not for us to separate between the reality and the emblem which God has conjoined. Papists confound the reality and the sign: profane men, as, for example, Suenckfeldius, and the like, separate the signs from the realities. Let us 			 maintain a middle course,   			  <a name="fr_531"></a><a href="#fn_531"><font size="1">532</font></a>
  			  or, in other words, let us observe the connection appointed by the Lord, but still keep them distinct, that we may not mistakingly transfer to the one what belongs to the other.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.i-p36"></a>It remains that we speak of the <i>second </i>point — the resemblance between the ancient signs and ours. It is a well-known dogma of the schoolmen — that the Sacraments of the ancient law were emblems of grace, but ours confer it. This passage is admirably suited for refuting that error, for it shows that the reality of the Sacrament was presented to the ancient people of God no less than to us. It is therefore a base fancy of the 			 Sorbonists, that the holy fathers under the law had the signs without the reality. I grant, indeed, that the efficacy of the signs is furnished to us at once more clearly and more abundantly from the time of Christ’s manifestation in the flesh than it was possessed by the fathers. Thus there is a difference between us and them only in degree, or, (as they commonly say,) of “more and less,” for we receive more fully what they received in a smaller measure. It is not as if they had 			 had bare emblems, while we enjoy the reality.  			  <a name="fr_532"></a><a href="#fn_532"><font size="1">533</font></a>
 </p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.i-p38"></a>Some explain it to mean, that they  			  <a name="fr_533"></a><a href="#fn_533"><font size="1">534</font></a>
  			 <i>ate the same meat </i>together among themselves, and do not wish us to understand that there is a comparison between us and them; but these do not consider Paul’s object. For what does he mean to say here, but that the ancient people of God were honored with the same benefits with us, and were partakers of the same sacraments, that we might not, from confiding in any peculiar privilege, imagine that we would be exempted from the punishment which they endured? At the same time, I 			 should not be prepared to contest the point with any one; I merely state my own opinion. In the meantime, I am well aware, what show of reason is advanced by those who adopt the opposite interpretation — that it suits best with the similitude made use of immediately before — that all the Israelites had the same race-ground marked out for them, and all started from the same point: all entered upon the same course: all were partakers of the same hope, but many were shut out from the reward. When, 			 however, I take everything attentively into consideration, I am not induced by these considerations to give up my opinion; for it is not without good reason that the Apostle makes mention of two sacraments merely, and, more particularly, baptism. For what purpose was this, but to contrast them with us? Unquestionably, if he had restricted his comparison to the body of that people, he would rather have brought forward circumcision, and other sacraments that were better known and more 			 distinguished, but, instead of this, he chose rather those that were more obscure, because they served more as a contrast between us and them. Nor would the application that he subjoins be otherwise so suitable — “All things that happened to them are examples to us, inasmuch as we there see the judgments of God that are impending over us, if we involve ourselves in the same crimes.”</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xvii.i-p40"></a><a name="xvii.i-p40.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.i-p41"></a><b>4.</b> <i>That rock was Christ</i>  Some absurdly pervert these words of Paul, as if he had said, that Christ was the spiritual rock, and as if he were not speaking of that rock which was a visible sign, for we see that he is expressly treating of outward signs. The 			 objection that they make — that the rock is spoken of as <i>spiritual</i>, is a frivolous one, inasmuch as that epithet is applied to it simply that we may know that it was a token of a spiritual mystery. In the mean time, there is no doubt, that he compares our sacraments with the ancient ones. Their <i>second </i>objection is more foolish and more childish — 			 “How could a rock,” say they, “that stood firm in its place, <i>follow </i>the Israelites?” — as if it were not abundantly manifest, that by the word <i>rock </i>is meant the stream of water, which never ceased to accompany the people. For Paul extols   			  <a name="fr_534"></a><a href="#fn_534"><font size="1">535</font></a>
  			  the grace of God, on this account, that he commanded the water that was drawn out from the rock to flow forth wherever the people journeyed, as if the rock itself had followed them. Now if Paul’s meaning were, that Christ is the spiritual foundation of the Church, what occasion were there for his using the past tense?   			  <a name="fr_535"></a><a href="#fn_535"><font size="1">536</font></a>
  			  It is abundantly manifest, that something is here expressed that was peculiar to the fathers. Away, then, with that foolish fancy by which contentious men choose rather to show their impudence, than admit that they are sacramental forms of expression!   			  <a name="fr_536"></a><a href="#fn_536"><font size="1">537</font></a>
 </p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.i-p45"></a>I have, however, already stated, that the reality of the things signified was exhibited in connection with the ancient sacraments. As, therefore, they were emblems of Christ, it follows, that Christ was connected with them, not locally, nor by a natural or substantial union, but sacramentally. On this principle the Apostle says, that <i>the rock was 			 Christ</i>, for nothing is more common than metonymy in speaking of sacraments. The name of the thing, therefore, is transferred here to the sign — not as if it were strictly applicable, but figuratively, on the ground of that connection which I have mentioned. I touch upon this, however, the more slightly, because it will be more largely treated of when we come to the 11th Chapter.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.i-p46"></a>There remains another question. “Seeing that we now in the Supper eat the body of Christ, and drink his blood, how could the Jews be partakers of <i>the same spiritual meat and drink,</i> when there was as yet no flesh of Christ that they could eat?” I answer, that 			 though his flesh did not as yet exist, it was, nevertheless, food for them. Nor is this an empty or sophistical subtilty, for their salvation depended on the benefit of his death and resurrection. Hence, they required to receive the flesh and the blood of Christ, that they might participate in the benefit of redemption. This reception of it was the secret work of the Holy Spirit, who wrought in them in such a manner, that Christ’s flesh, though not yet created, was made efficacious in them. He 			 means, however, that they ate in their own way, which was different from ours,   			  <a name="fr_537"></a><a href="#fn_537"><font size="1">538</font></a>
  			  and this is what I have previously stated, that Christ is now presented to us more fully, according to the measure of the revelation. For, in the present day, the eating is substantial, which it could not have been then — that is, Christ feeds us with his flesh, which has been sacrificed for us, and appointed as our food, and from this we derive life.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xvii.i-p48"></a><a name="xvii.i-p48.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.i-p49"></a><b>5.</b> <i>But many of them.</i> We have now the reason why the Apostle has premised these things — that we might not claim for ourselves any dignity or excellence above them, but might walk in humility and fear, for thus only shall we secure, that 			 we have not been favored in vain with the light of truth, and with such an abundance of gracious benefits. “God,” says he, “had chosen them all as his people, but many of them fell from grace. Let us, therefore, take heed, lest the same thing should happen to us, being admonished by so many examples, for God will not suffer <i>that </i>to go unpunished in <i>us</i>, which he punished so severely in <i>them</i>.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.i-p50"></a>Here again it is objected: “If it is true, that hypocrites and wicked persons in that age ate spiritual meat, do unbelievers in the present day partake of the reality in the sacraments?” Some, afraid lest the unbelief of men should seem to detract from the truth of God, teach that the reality is received by the wicked along with the sign. This fear, however, is needless, for 			 the Lord offers, it is true, to the worthy and to the unworthy what he represents, but all are not capable of receiving it. In the meantime, the sacrament does not change its nature, nor does it lose anything of its efficacy. Hence the manna, in relation to God, was spiritual meat even to unbelievers, but because the mouth of unbelievers was but carnal, they did not eat what was given them. The fuller discussion, however, of this question I 			 reserve for the 11th Chapter.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.i-p51"></a>For they were overthrown. Proof is here furnished, by adducing a token, that they did not please God — inasmuch as he exercised his wrath upon them with severity,   			  <a name="fr_538"></a><a href="#fn_538"><font size="1">539</font></a>
  			  and took vengeance on their ingratitude. Some understand this as referring to the whole of the people that died in the desert, with the exception of only two — Caleb and Joshua. (<a name="xvii.i-p52.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#029">Nu 14:29</a><a name="xvii.i-p52.2"></a>.) I understand him, however, as referring merely to those, whom he immediately afterwards makes mention of in different classes.</p>  <a name="xvii.ii"></a>

 <p><a name="xvii.ii-p18"></a><b>6.</b> <i>Now these things were types to us.</i> He warns us in still more explicit terms, that we have to do with the punishment that was inflicted upon them, so that they are a lesson to us, that we may not provoke the anger of God as they did. “God,” says he, “in punishing them has set before 			 us, as in a picture, his severity, that, instructed by their example, we may learn to fear.” Of the term <i>type </i>I shall speak presently. Only for the present I should wish my readers to know, that it is not without consideration that I have given a different rendering from that of the old translation,   			  <a name="fr_539"></a><a href="#fn_539"><font size="1">540</font></a>
  			  and of Erasmus. For they obscure Paul’s meaning, or at least they do not bring out with sufficient clearness this idea — that God has in that people presented a picture for our instruction.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.ii-p20"></a><i>That we might not lust after evil things.</i> He now enumerates particular instances, or certain examples, that he may take occasion from this to reprove some vices, as to which it was proper that the Corinthians should be admonished. I am of opinion, that the history that is here referred to is what is recorded in <a name="xvii.ii-p20.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#004">Nu 11:4</a><a name="xvii.ii-p20.1"></a>, etc., though others refer it to what is recorded in <a name="xvii.ii-p20.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#064">Nu 26:64</a><a name="xvii.ii-p20.2"></a>. The people, after having been for some time fed with manna, at length took a dislike to it, and began to desire other kinds of food, which they had been accustomed to partake of in Egypt. Now they sinned in two 			 ways, for they despised the peculiar gift of God, and they eagerly longed after a variety of meats and delicacies, contrary to the will of God. The Lord, provoked by this lawless appetite, inflicted upon the people a grievous blow. Hence the place was called the</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="xvii.ii-p21"></a>graves of lust,   			  <a name="fr_540"></a><a href="#fn_540"><font size="1">541</font></a>
  			  because there they buried those whom <br> 			 the Lord had smitten. (<a name="xvii.ii-p22.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#034">Nu 11:34</a><a name="xvii.ii-p22.2"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.ii-p23"></a>The Lord by this example testified how much he hates those lusts that arise from dislike of his gifts, and from our lawless appetite, for whatever goes beyond the measure that God has prescribed is justly reckoned evil and unlawful.</p>

 <p><a name="xvii.ii-p25"></a><b>7.</b> <i>Neither be ye idolaters</i>  He touches upon the history that is recorded in <a name="xvii.ii-p25.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#007">Ex 32:7</a><a name="xvii.ii-p25.1"></a>, etc. For when Moses made a longer stay upon the mountain than 			 the unseemly fickleness of the people could endure, Aaron was constrained to make a calf, and set it up as an object of worship. Not that the people wished to change their God, but rather to have some visible token of God’s presence, in accordance with their carnal apprehension. God, in punishing at that time this idolatry with the greatest severity, showed by that example how much he abhors idolatry.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.ii-p26"></a><i>As it is written, The people sat down</i>  This passage is rightly interpreted by few, for they understand intemperance among the people to have been the occasion of wantonness,   			  <a name="fr_541"></a><a href="#fn_541"><font size="1">542</font></a>
  			  in accordance with the common proverb, “Dancing comes after a full diet.”   			  <a name="fr_542"></a><a href="#fn_542"><font size="1">543</font></a>
  			  But Moses speaks of a sacred feast, or in other words, what they celebrated in honor of the idol. Hence <i>feasting </i>and <i>play </i>were two appendages of idolatry. For it was customary, both among the people of Israel and among the rotaries of superstition, to have a feast in connection with a sacrifice, as a part of divine worship, at which no profane or unclean persons were 			 allowed to be present. The Gentiles, in addition to this, appointed sacred games in honor of their idols, in conformity with which the Israelites doubtless on that occasion worshipped their calf,   			  <a name="fr_543"></a><a href="#fn_543"><font size="1">544</font></a>
  			  for such is the presumption of the human mind, that it ascribes to God whatever pleases itself. Hence the Gentiles have fallen into such a depth of infatuation as to believe, that their gods are delighted with the basest spectacles, immodest dances, impurity of speech, and every kind of obscenity. Hence in imitation of them the Israelitish people, having observed their sacred banquet, rose up to celebrate the games, that nothing might be wanting in honor of the 			 idol. This is the true and simple meaning.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.ii-p30"></a>But here it is asked, why the Apostle makes mention of the feast and the games, rather than of adoration, for this is the chief thing in idolatry, while the other two things were merely appendages. The reason is, that he has selected what best suited the case of the Corinthians. For it is not likely, that they frequented the assemblies of the wicked, for the purpose of prostrating themselves before the idols, but partook of their feasts, 			 held in honor of their deities, and did not keep at a distance from those base ceremonies, which were tokens of idolatry. It is not therefore without good reason that the Apostle declares, that their particular form of offense is expressly condemned by God. He intimates, in short, that no part of idolatry  			  <a name="fr_544"></a><a href="#fn_544"><font size="1">545</font></a>
  			 can be touched without contracting pollution, and that those will not escape punishment from the hand of God, who defile themselves with the outward tokens of idolatry.</p>

 <p><a name="xvii.ii-p33"></a><b>8.</b> <i>Neither let us commit fornication</i>  Now he speaks of <i>fornication</i>, in respect of which, as appears from historical 			 accounts, great licentiousness prevailed among the Corinthians, and we may readily infer from what goes before, that those who had professed themselves to be Christ’s were not yet altogether free from this vice. The punishment of this vice, also, ought to alarm us, and lead us to bear in mind, how loathsome impure lusts are to God, for there perished in one day twenty-three thousand, or as Moses says, twenty-four. Though they differ as to number, 			 it is easy to reconcile them, as it is no unusual thing, when it is not intended to number exactly and minutely each head,   			  <a name="fr_545"></a><a href="#fn_545"><font size="1">546</font></a>
  			  to put down a number that comes near it, as among the Romans there were those that received the name of <a name="xvii.ii-p34.2"></a><i>Centumviri</i>,   			  <a name="fr_546"></a><a href="#fn_546"><font size="1">547</font></a>
  			  (The <i>Hundred</i>,) while in reality there were two above the hundred. As there were, therefore, about twenty-four thousand that were overthrown by the Lord’s hand — that is, above twenty-three, Moses has set down the number <i>above </i>the mark, and Paul, the number <i>below 			 </i>it, and in this way there is in reality no difference. This history is recorded in <a name="xvii.ii-p35.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#009">Nu 25:9</a><a name="xvii.ii-p35.3"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.ii-p36"></a>There remains, however, one difficulty here — why it is that Paul attributes this punishment to fornication, while Moses relates that the anger of God was aroused against the people on this account — that they had initiated themselves in the sacred rites of Baalpeor.  			  <a name="fr_547"></a><a href="#fn_547"><font size="1">548</font></a>
  			 But as the defection began with fornication, and the children of Israel fell into that impiety, not so much from being influenced by religious considerations,  			  <a name="fr_548"></a><a href="#fn_548"><font size="1">549</font></a>
  			 as from being allured by the enticements of harlots, everything evil that followed from it ought to be attributed to fornication. For Balaam had given this counsel, that the Midianites should prostitute their daughters to the Israelites, with the view of estranging them from the true worship of God. Nay more, their excessive blindness, in allowing themselves to be drawn into impiety  			  <a name="fr_549"></a><a href="#fn_549"><font size="1">550</font></a>
  			 by the enticements of harlots, was the punishment of lust. Let us learn, accordingly, that fornication is no light offense, which was punished on that occasion by God so severely and indeed in a variety of ways.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xvii.ii-p40"></a><a name="xvii.ii-p40.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.ii-p41"></a><b>9.</b> <i>Neither let us tempt Christ</i>  This part of the exhortation refers to the history that is recorded in <a name="xvii.ii-p41.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#006">Nu 21:6</a><a name="xvii.ii-p41.1"></a>. For the people, having become 			 weary of the length of time, began to complain of their condition, and to expostulate with God — “Why has God deceived us,” etc. This murmuring of the people Paul speaks of as a <i>tempting</i>; and not without good reason, for <i>tempting </i>is opposed to patience. What reason was there at that time why the people should rise up against God, except this — 			 that, under the influence of base desire,   			  <a name="fr_550"></a><a href="#fn_550"><font size="1">551</font></a>
  			  they could not wait in patience the arrival of the time appointed by the Lord? Let us, therefore, take notice, that the fountain of that evil against which Paul here warns us is impatience, when we wish to go before God, and do not give ourselves up to be ruled by Him, but rather wish to bind him to our inclination and laws. This evil God severely punished in the Israelitish people. Now he remains always like himself — a just Judge. Let us therefore not <i>tempt </i>him, if we would not have experience of the same punishment.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.ii-p43"></a>This is a remarkable passage in proof of the eternity of Christ; for the cavil of Erasmus has no force — “Let us not tempt Christ, as some of them tempted <i>God</i>;” for to supply the word <i>God </i>is extremely forced.   			  <a name="fr_551"></a><a href="#fn_551"><font size="1">552</font></a>
  			  Nor is it to be wondered that Christ is called the Leader of the Israelitish people. For as God was never propitious to his people except through that Mediator, so he conferred no benefit except through his hand. Farther, the angel who appeared at first to Moses, and was always present with the people during their journeying, is frequently called <a name="xvii.ii-p44.1"></a>יהוה, 			 Jehovah.   			  <a name="fr_552"></a><a href="#fn_552"><font size="1">553</font></a>
  			  Let us then regard it as a settled point, that that angel was the Son of God, and was even then the guide of the Church of which he was the Head. As to the term <i>Christ</i>, from its having a signification that corresponds with his human nature, it was not as yet applicable to the Son of God, but it is assigned to him by the communication of properties, as we read 			 elsewhere, that</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="xvii.ii-p46"></a>the Son of Man came down from heaven. (<a name="xvii.ii-p46.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#013">Joh 3:13</a><a name="xvii.ii-p46.1"></a>.)</p>

 <p><a name="xvii.ii-p48"></a><b>10.</b> <i>Neither murmur ye</i>  Others understand this to be the murmuring that arose, when the twelve, who had been sent to spy out the land, disheartened, on their return, the minds of the people. But as that murmuring was not punished suddenly by any special 			 chastisement from the Lord, but was simply followed by the infliction of this punishment — that all were excluded from the possession of the land, it is necessary to explain this passage otherwise. It was a most severe punishment, it is true, to be shut out from entering the land,   			  <a name="fr_553"></a><a href="#fn_553"><font size="1">554</font></a>
  			  but the words of Paul, when he says that they were<i> destroyed</i> by the <i>destroyer</i>, express another kind of chastisement. I refer it, accordingly, to the history, which is recorded in the sixteenth chapter of 			 Numbers. [<a name="xvii.ii-p49.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#001">Nu 16:1-50</a><a name="xvii.ii-p49.2"></a>]. For when God had punished the pride of Korah and Abiram, the people raised a tumult against Moses and Aaron, as if they had been to blame for the punishment which the Lord had inflicted. This madness of the people God punished by sending down fire from heaven, which swallowed up many of them — upwards of fourteen thousand. It is, therefore, a striking and 			 memorable token of God’s wrath against rebels and seditious persons, that murmur against him.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.ii-p50"></a>Those persons, it is true, <i>murmured</i> against Moses; but as they had no ground for insulting him, and had no occasion for being incensed against him, unless it was that he had faithfully discharged the duty which had been enjoined upon him by God, God himself was assailed by that murmuring. Let us, accordingly, 			 bear in mind that we have to do with God, and not with men, if we rise up against the faithful ministers of God, and let us know that this audacity   			  <a name="fr_554"></a><a href="#fn_554"><font size="1">555</font></a>
  			  will not go unpunished.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.ii-p52"></a>By the <i>destroyer</i> you may understand the Angel, who executed the judgment of God. Now he sometimes employs the ministry of bad angels, sometimes of good, in punishing men, as appears from various passages of Scripture. As Paul here does not make a distinction between the one and the other, you may understand 			 it of either.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xvii.ii-p53"></a><a name="xvii.ii-p53.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.ii-p54"></a><b>11.</b> <i>Now all these things happened as types.</i> He again repeats it — that all these things happened to the Israelites, that they might be types to us — that is, examples, in which God places his judgments before our <i>eyes</i>  I am well aware, that others philosophize on these words with great refinement, but I think that I have fully expressed the Apostle’s meaning, when I say, that by these examples, like so many pictures, we are instructed what judgments of God are impending over idolaters, fornicators, and other contemners of God. For they are lively pictures, representing God as angry on account of such sins. This 			 exposition, besides being simple and accurate, has this additional advantage, that it blocks up the path of certain madmen,   			  <a name="fr_555"></a><a href="#fn_555"><font size="1">556</font></a>
  			  who wrest this passage for the purpose of proving, that among that ancient people there was nothing done but what was shadowy. First of all, they assume that that people is a figure of the Church. From this they infer, that everything that God promised to them, or accomplished for them — all benefits, all punishments,   			  <a name="fr_556"></a><a href="#fn_556"><font size="1">557</font></a>
  			  only prefigured what required to be accomplished in reality after Christ’s advent. This is a most pestilential frenzy, which does great injury to the holy fathers, and much greater still to God. For that people was a figure of the Christian Church, in such a manner as to be at the same time a true Church. Their condition represented ours in such a manner that there was at the same time, even then, a proper condition of a Church. The promises given to them shadowed 			 forth the gospel in such a way, that they had it included in them. Their sacraments served to prefigure ours in such a way, that they were nevertheless, even for that period, true sacraments, having a present efficacy. In fine, those who at that time made a right use, both of doctrine, and of signs, were endowed with the same spirit of faith as we are. These madmen, therefore, derive no support from these words of Paul, which do not mean that the things that were done in that age were types, in 			 such a way as to have at that time no reality, but a mere empty show. Nay more, they expressly teach us, (as we have explained,) that those things which may be of use <i>for our admonition</i>, are there set forth before us, as in a picture.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.ii-p57"></a><i>They are written for our admonition</i>  This second clause is explanatory of the former; for it was of no importance to the Israelites, but to us exclusively, that these things should be committed to record.   			  <a name="fr_557"></a><a href="#fn_557"><font size="1">558</font></a>
  			  It does not, however, follow from this, that these inflictions were not true chastisements from God, suited for their correction at that time, but as God then inflicted his judgments, so he designed that they should be kept everlastingly in remembrance for our instruction. For of what advantage were the history of them to the dead; and as to the living, how would it be of advantage to them, unless they repented, admonished by the examples of others? Now he takes for 			 granted the principle, as to which all pious persons ought to be agreed — that there is nothing revealed in the Scriptures, that is not profitable to be known.</p>  		  
 <p class="Super"><a name="xvii.ii-p59"></a><i>Upon whom the ends of the world are come</i>  The word <a name="xvii.ii-p59.1"></a>τέλη (ends) sometimes means <i>mysteries</i>;   			  <a name="fr_558"></a><a href="#fn_558"><font size="1">559</font></a>
  			  and that signification would not suit in with this passage. I follow, however, the common rendering, as being more simple. He says then, that the ends of all ages are come upon us, inasmuch as the fullness of all things is suitable to this age, because it is now the last times. For the kingdom of Christ is the main object of the Law and of all the Prophets. But this statement of Paul is at variance with the common opinion — that God, while 			 more severe under the Old Testament, and always ready and armed for the punishment of crimes, has now begun to be exorable, and more ready to forgive. They explain, also, our being under the law of grace, in this sense — that we have God more placable than the ancients had. But what says Paul? If God inflicted punishment upon them, he will not the more spare you. Away, then, with the error, that God is now more remiss in exacting the punishment of crimes! It must, indeed, be acknowledged, that, 			 by the advent of Christ, God’s goodness has been more openly and more abundantly poured forth towards men; but what has this to do with impunity for the abandoned, who abuse his grace?   			  <a name="fr_559"></a><a href="#fn_559"><font size="1">560</font></a>
 </p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.ii-p62"></a>This one thing only must be noticed, that in the present day the mode of punishment is different; for as God of old was more prepared to reward the pious with outward tokens of his blessing, that he might testify to them his fatherly love, so he showed his wrath more by corporal punishments. <i>Now</i>, on the other hand, in that fuller revelation which we enjoy, he does not so frequently inflict visible punishments, and does not so 			 frequently inflict corporal punishment even upon the wicked. You will find more on this subject in my Institutes.  			  <a name="fr_560"></a><a href="#fn_560"><font size="1">561</font></a>

 <p><a name="xvii.ii-p65"></a><b>12.</b> <i>Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth</i>  The Apostle concludes from what goes before, that we must not glory in our beginnings or progress, so as to resign ourselves to carelessness and inactivity.   			  <a name="fr_561"></a><a href="#fn_561"><font size="1">562</font></a>
  			 For the Corinthians gloried in their condition in such a way, that, forgetting their weakness, they fell into many crimes. This was a false confidence of such a kind as the Prophets frequently reprove in the Israelitish people. As, however, Papists wrest this passage for the purpose of maintaining their impious doctrine respecting faith, as having constantly doubt connected with it,   			  <a name="fr_562"></a><a href="#fn_562"><font size="1">563</font></a>
  			  let us observe that there are two kinds of assurance.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.ii-p68"></a>The <i>one</i> is that which rests on the promises of God, because a pious conscience feels assured that God will never be wanting to it; and, relying on this unconquerable persuasion, triumphs boldly and intrepidly over Satan and sin, and yet, nevertheless, keeping in mind its own infirmity, casts itself  			  <a name="fr_563"></a><a href="#fn_563"><font size="1">564</font></a>
  			 upon God, and with carefulness and anxiety commits itself to him. This kind of assurance is sacred, and is inseparable from faith, as appears from many passages of Scripture, and especially <a name="xvii.ii-p69.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#033">Ro 8:33</a><a name="xvii.ii-p69.2"></a>.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.ii-p70"></a>The <i>other</i> arises from negligence, when men, puffed up with the gifts that they have, give themselves no concern, as if they were beyond the reach of danger, but rest satisfied with their condition. Hence it is that they are exposed to all the assaults of Satan. This is the kind of assurance which Paul would have the Corinthians to abandon, because he saw that they were satisfied with themselves under the influence of a silly conceit. 			 He does not, however, exhort them to be always anxiously in doubt as to the will of God, or to tremble from uncertainty as to their salvation, as Papists dream.  			  <a name="fr_564"></a><a href="#fn_564"><font size="1">565</font></a>
  			 In short, let us bear in mind, that Paul is here addressing persons who were puffed up with a base confidence in the flesh, and represses that assurance which is grounded upon men — not upon God. For after commending the Colossians for the solidity or <i>steadfastness of their faith</i>, (<a name="xvii.ii-p71.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#005">Col 2:5</a><a name="xvii.ii-p71.2"></a>,) he exhorts them to be</p>

  			  Let others take their own way of interpreting this. For my part, I am of opinion that it was intended for their consolation, lest on hearing of such appalling instances of the wrath of God, as he had previously related, they should feel discouraged, being overpowered with alarm. Hence, in order that his exhortation might be of advantage, he adds, that there is room for repentance. “There is 			 no reason why you should despond; for I have not had it in view to give you occasion for despair, nor has anything happened to you but what is common to men.” Others are of opinion that he rather chides their cowardice in giving way, on being so slightly tried;   			  <a name="fr_566"></a><a href="#fn_566"><font size="1">567</font></a>

  			  The meaning, then, according to them would be this: “Did it become you thus to give way under a slight trial?” But as it agrees better with the context, if we consider it as consolation, I am on this account rather inclined to that view.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.iii-p20"></a><i>But God is faithful</i>  As he exhorted them to be of good courage as to the past, in order that he might stir them up to repentance, so he also comforts them as to the future with a sure hope, on the ground that <i>God would not suffer them to be tempted 			 beyond their strength.</i> He exhorts them, however, to look to the Lord, because a temptation, however slight it may be, will straightway overcome us, and all will be over with us, if we rely upon our own strength. He speaks of the Lord, as <i>faithful</i>, not merely as being true to his promises, but 			 as though he had said. The Lord is the sure guardian of his people, under whose protection you are safe, for he never leaves his people destitute. Accordingly, when he has received you under his protection, you have no cause to fear, provided you depend entirely upon him. For certainly this were a species of deception, if he were to withdraw his aid in the time of need, or if he were, on seeing us weak and ready to sink under the load, to lengthen out our trials still farther. 			   			  <a name="fr_568"></a><a href="#fn_568"><font size="1">569</font></a>
 </p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.iii-p22"></a>Now God helps us in two ways, that we may not be overcome by the temptation; for he supplies us with strength, and he sets limits to the temptation. It is of the <i>second </i>of these ways that the Apostle here chiefly speaks. At the same time, he does not exclude the former — that God alleviates temptations, that they may not overpower us by their weight. For he knows the 			 measure of our power, which he has himself conferred. According to that, he regulates our temptations. The term <i>temptation</i> I take here as denoting, in a general way, everything that allures us.</p>

 <p><a name="xvii.iii-p24"></a><b>14.</b> <i>Wherefore, my beloved, flee, etc.</i> The Apostle now returns to the particular question, from which he had for a little digressed, for, lest bare doctrine should have little effect among them, he has introduced those general exhortations that we have read, but now he pursues the 			 discussion on which he had entered — that it is not allowable for a Christian man to connect himself with the superstitions of the wicked, so as to take part in them. <i>Flee</i>, says he,<i> from idolatry</i>  In the first 			 place, let us observe what meaning he attaches to the term <i>Idolatry</i>  He certainly did not suspect the Corinthians of such a degree of ignorance or carelessness   			  <a name="fr_569"></a><a href="#fn_569"><font size="1">570</font></a>
  			  as to think, that they worshipped idols in their heart. But as they made no scruple of frequenting the assemblies of the wicked, and observing along with them certain rites instituted in honor of idols, he condemns this liberty taken by them, as being a very bad example. It is certain, then, that when he here makes mention of <i>idolatry</i>, he, speaks of what is outward, or, if you prefer it, of the profession   			  <a name="fr_570"></a><a href="#fn_570"><font size="1">571</font></a>
  			  of idolatry. For as God is said to be worshipped by the bending of the knee, and other tokens of reverence, while the principal and genuine worship of him is inward, so is it also as to idols, for the case holds the same in things opposite. It is to no purpose that very many in the present day endeavor to excuse outward actions   			  <a name="fr_571"></a><a href="#fn_571"><font size="1">572</font></a>
  			  on this pretext, that the heart is not in them, while Paul convicts of idolatry those very acts, and assuredly with good reason. For, as we owe to God not merely the secret affection of the heart, but also outward adoration, the man who offers to an idol an appearance of adoration takes away so much of the honor due to God. Let him allege as he may that his heart is quite away from it. The action itself is to be seen, in which the honor that is due to God is 			 transferred to an idol.</p>

 <p><a name="xvii.iii-p29"></a><b>15.</b> <i>I speak as to wise men.</i> As he was about to take his argument from the mystery of the Supper, he arouses them by this little preface, that they may consider more attentively the magnitude of the thing.   			  <a name="fr_572"></a><a href="#fn_572"><font size="1">573</font></a>
  			  “I do not address mere novices. You understand the efficacy of the sacred Supper in it we are ingrafted into the Lord’s body. How unseemly a thing is it then, that you should enter into fellowship with the wicked, so as to be united in one body. At the same time, he tacitly reproves their want of consideration in this respect, that, while 			 accurately instructed in the school of Christ, they allowed themselves in gross vice, as to which there was no difficulty in forming an opinion.</p>

 <p><a name="xvii.iii-p32"></a><b>16.</b> <i>The cup of blessing</i>  While the sacred Supper of Christ has two elements — bread and wine — he begins with the second. He calls it, <i>the cup of blessing</i>, as having been set apart for a mystical benediction.   			  <a name="fr_573"></a><a href="#fn_573"><font size="1">574</font></a>
  			  For I do not agree with those who understand <i>blessing to </i>mean <i>thanksgiving</i>, and interpret the verb <i>to bless</i>, as meaning to <i>give thanks</i>  I acknowledge, indeed, that it is sometimes employed in this sense, but never in the construction that Paul has here made use of, for the idea of Erasmus, as to supplying a preposition,   			  <a name="fr_574"></a><a href="#fn_574"><font size="1">575</font></a>
  			  is exceedingly forced. On the other hand, the meaning that I adopt is easy, and has nothing of intricacy.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.iii-p35"></a>To <i>bless the cup,</i> then, is to set it apart for this purpose, that it may be to us an emblem of the blood of Christ. This is done by the word of promise, when believers meet together according to Christ’s appointment to celebrate the remembrance of his death in this Sacrament. The consecration, however, 			 which the Papists make use of, is a kind of sorcery derived from heathens,   			  <a name="fr_575"></a><a href="#fn_575"><font size="1">576</font></a>
  			  which has nothing in common with the pure rite observed by Christians. Everything, it is true, that we eat <i>is sanctified by the word of God</i>, as Paul himself elsewhere bears witness, (<a name="xvii.iii-p36.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#005">1Ti 4:5</a><a name="xvii.iii-p36.2"></a>;) but that <i>blessing </i>is for a different purpose — that our use of the gifts of God may be pure, and may tend to the glory of their Author, and to our advantage. On the other hand, the design of the mystical <i>blessing </i>in the Supper is, that the wine may be no longer a common beverage, but set apart for the spiritual nourishment of the soul, while it is an emblem of the blood of Christ.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.iii-p37"></a>Paul says, that the <i>cup </i>which has been in this manner<i> blessed </i>is <a name="xvii.iii-p37.1"></a>κοινωνίαν — the<i> comnunion</i> of the blood of 			 the Lord. It is asked, in what sense? Let contention be avoided, and there will be nothing of obscurity. It is true, that believers are united together by Christ’s blood, so as to become one body. It is also true, that a unity of this kind is with propriety termed <a name="xvii.iii-p37.2"></a>κοινωνία (<i>communion</i>.) I make the same acknowledgment as to <i>the bread</i>  Farther, I observe what Paul immediately adds, as it were, by way of explanation — that we <i>all become one body, because we are together partakers of the same bread</i>  But whence, I pray you, comes that <a name="xvii.iii-p37.3"></a>κοινωνία (<i>communion</i>) between us, but from this, that we are united to Christ in such a way, that</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="xvii.iii-p38"></a>we are flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bones? <br> 			 (<a name="xvii.iii-p38.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#030">Eph 5:30</a><a name="xvii.iii-p38.2"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.iii-p39"></a>For we must first of all be incorporated (so to speak) into Christ, that we may be united to each other. In addition to this, Paul is not disputing at present merely in reference to a mutual fellowship among men, but as to the spiritual union between Christ and believers, with the view of drawing from this, that it is an intolerable sacrilege for them to be polluted by fellowship with idols. From the connection of the 			 passage, therefore, we may conclude, that (<a name="xvii.iii-p39.1"></a>κοινωνίαν) the <i>communion of the blood </i>is that connection which we have with the blood of Christ, when he engrafts all of us together into his body, that he may live in us, and we in him.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.iii-p40"></a>Now, when the cup is called a <i>participation</i>, the expression, I acknowledge, is figurative, provided that the truth held forth in the figure is not taken away, or, in other words, provided that the reality itself is also present, and that the soul has as truly <i>communion in the blood</i>, as we drink wine with the mouth. But Papists could not say this, that <i>the cup of blessing is a participation in the blood of Christ</i>, for the Supper that they observe is mutilated and torn: if indeed we can give the name of the Supper to that strange 			 ceremony which is a patchwork of various human contrivances, and scarcely retains the slightest vestige of the institution of our Lord. But, supposing that everything else were as it ought to be, this one thing is at variance with the right use of the Supper — the keeping back of the whole of the people from partaking of the cup, which is the half of the Sacrament.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.iii-p41"></a><i>The bread which we break</i>  From this it appears, that it was the custom of the ancient Church to break one loaf, and distribute to every one his own morsel, in order that there might be presented more clearly to the view of all believers their union to the one body of Christ. And that this custom was long 			 kept up appears from the testimony of those who flourished in the three centuries that succeeded the age of the Apostles. Hence arose the superstition, that no one dared to touch the bread with his hand, but each one had it put into his mouth by the priest.</p>

 <p><a name="xvii.iii-p43"></a><b>17.</b> <i>For we are one bread.</i> I have already stated above, that it was not Paul’s particular design here to exhort us to love, but he mentions this by the way, that the Corinthians may understand that we must, even by external profession, maintain that unity which subsists between us 			 and Christ, inasmuch as we all assemble together to receive the symbol of that sacred unity. In this second part of the statement, he makes mention only of the one part of the Sacrament, and it is the manner of Scripture to describe by Synecdoche   			  <a name="fr_576"></a><a href="#fn_576"><font size="1">577</font></a>
  			  the entire Supper by <i>the breaking of bread</i>  It is necessary to warn my readers, in passing, as to this, lest any less experienced person should be put off his guard by the foolish cavil that is brought forward by certain sycophants — as if Paul, by mentioning merely the bread, had it in view to deprive the people of the one 			 half of the Sacrament.</p>

 <p><a name="xvii.iii-p46"></a><b>18.</b> <i>Behold Israel after the flesh</i>  He establishes it by another example, that such is the nature of all sacred observances, that they bind us in a kind of fellowship with God. For the law of Moses admits no one to a feast upon a sacrifice, but the man who 			 has duly prepared himself. I speak not of priests merely, but of those among the common people who eat of the remains of the sacrifice. Hence it follows, that all who eat of the flesh of the sacrificed victim, are <i>partakers with the altar</i>, that is, of the sanctification, with which God has set apart his Temple, and the sacred rites that are performed in 			 it.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.iii-p47"></a>This expression <i>after the flesh</i>, may seem to be added in order that the Corinthians, on comparing the two, might set a higher value on the efficacy of our Supper. “If there was so much virtue in the ancient figures and in those rudiments of youthful education, how much more must we 			 reckon that there is in our mysteries, in which God shines forth much more fully upon us!” At the same time, it is more simple, in my opinion, to say that Paul intended merely by this mark to distinguish the Jews that were still under the law from those that had been converted to Christ. Now there was a contrast that remained to be made — that if the sacred rites appointed by God sanctify those who observe them, pollution, on the other hand, is contracted from the sacred rites rendered to 			 idols.   			  <a name="fr_577"></a><a href="#fn_577"><font size="1">578</font></a>

 <p><a name="xvii.iv-p16"></a><b>19.</b> <i>What do I say then?</i> It might seem at first view as if the Apostle either argued inconclusively, or ascribed to idols something of existence and of power. Now it might readily be objected — “What comparison is there between the living God and idols? God connects us with himself by 			 the sacraments. Be it so. How comes it that idols, which are <i>nothing</i>, (<a name="xvii.iv-p16.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#004">1Co 8:4</a><a name="xvii.iv-p16.1"></a>,) have so much power, as to be able to do the like? Do you think that <i>idols are anything</i>, or 			 can do anything?” He answers, that he does not look to the idols themselves;   			  <a name="fr_582"></a><a href="#fn_582"><font size="1">583</font></a>
  			  but rather has in view the intention of those who sacrifice to idols. For that was the source of the pollution that he had indirectly pointed out. He confesses, therefore, that an idol is nothing. He confesses that it is a mere delusion when the Gentiles take it upon them to go through solemn rites of dedication,   			  <a name="fr_583"></a><a href="#fn_583"><font size="1">584</font></a>
  			  and that the creatures of God are not polluted by such fooleries. But as the design of them is superstitious and condemnable, and as the work is base, he infers, that all who connect themselves with them as associates, are involved in pollution.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xvii.iv-p19"></a><a name="xvii.iv-p19.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.iv-p20"></a><b>20.</b> <i>But the things </i>  			  <a name="fr_584"></a><a href="#fn_584"><font size="1">585</font></a>
  			 <i> that the Gentiles sacrifice.</i> To complete the answer, a negative must be understood in this way: “I do not say that <i>an idol is anything</i>, nor do I imagine it to be endued with any virtue, but I say that <i>the Gentiles sacrifice 			 to the devil and not to gods</i> those things which they do sacrifice, and hence I estimate the work by their wicked and impious superstition. For we must always look to the intention with which a thing is done. He, then, who connects himself with them, declares that he has fellowship with them in the same impiety.” He proceeds accordingly with what he had commenced: “If we had to do with 			 God only, those things would be nothing, but, in relation to men, they become faulty; because no one sits down to an idol feast, who does not declare himself to be a worshipper of the idol.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.iv-p22"></a>Some, however, understand the term <i>demons </i>here as meaning the imaginary deities of the Gentiles, agreeably to their common way of speaking of them; for when they speak of <i>demons </i>they meant inferior deities, as, for example, heroes,   			  <a name="fr_585"></a><a href="#fn_585"><font size="1">586</font></a>
  			  and thus the term was taken in a good sense. Plato, in a variety of instances, employs the term to denote <i>genii</i>, or angels.   			  <a name="fr_586"></a><a href="#fn_586"><font size="1">587</font></a>
  			  That meaning, however, would be quite foreign to Paul’s design, for his object is to show that it is no light offense to have to do with actions that have any appearance of putting honor upon idols. Hence it suited his purpose, not to extenuate, but rather to magnify the impiety that is involved in it. How absurd, then, it would have been to select an honorable term to denote the most heinous wickedness! It is certain from the Prophet Baruch, (<a name="xvii.iv-p24.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/apo/bar004.htm#007">Bar 4:7</a><a name="xvii.iv-p24.4"></a>,) that <i>those things that are sacrificed to idols are sacrificed to devils</i>  (<a name="xvii.iv-p24.5"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#017">De 32:17</a><a name="xvii.iv-p24.5"></a>; <a name="xvii.iv-p24.6"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#005">Ps 96:5</a><a name="xvii.iv-p24.6"></a>.) In that passage in the writings of the Prophet, the Greek translation, which was at that time in common use, has <a name="xvii.iv-p24.7"></a>δαιμόνια — <i>demons</i>, and this is its common use in Scripture. How much more likely is it then, that Paul borrowed what he says from the Prophet, to 			 express the enormity of the evil, than that, speaking after the manner of the heathen, he extenuated what he was desirous to hold up to utter execration!</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.iv-p25"></a>It may seem, however, as if these things were somewhat at variance with what I stated a little ago — that Paul had an eye to the intention of idolaters, for it is not their intention to worship devils, but imaginary deities of their own framing. I answer, that the two things are quite in harmony, for when men become so <i>vain in their imaginations </i>(<a name="xvii.iv-p25.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#021">Ro 1:21</a><a name="xvii.iv-p25.1"></a>) as to render divine honor to creatures, rather than to the one God, this punishment is in readiness for them — that they serve Satan. For they do not find that “middle place”  			  <a name="fr_587"></a><a href="#fn_587"><font size="1">588</font></a>
  			 that they are in search of, but Satan straightway presents himself to them, as an object of adoration, whenever they have turned their back upon the true God.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.iv-p27"></a><i>I would not that ye.</i> If the term <i>demon </i>were used in an indifferent sense, how spiritless were Paul’s statement here, while, instead of this, it has the greatest weight and severity against idolaters! He subjoins the reason — because no one can have fellowship at the same time with God 			 and with idols. Now, in all sacred observances, there is a profession of fellowship. Let us know, therefore, that we are then, and then only, admitted by Christ to the sacred feast of his body and blood, when we have first of all bid farewell to every thing sacrilegious.   			  <a name="fr_588"></a><a href="#fn_588"><font size="1">589</font></a>
  			  For the man who would enjoy the one, must renounce the other. O thrice miserable the condition of those   			  <a name="fr_589"></a><a href="#fn_589"><font size="1">590</font></a>
  			  who, from fear of displeasing men, do not hesitate to pollute themselves with unlawful superstitions! For, by acting in this way, they voluntarily renounce fellowship with Christ, and obstruct their approach to his health-giving table.</p>

Having laid down the doctrine, he assumes a more vehement tone, from observing, that what was a most atrocious offense against God was regarded as nothing, or, at least, was looked upon as a very trivial error. The Corinthians 			 wished the liberty that they took to be reckoned excusable, as there is not one of us that willingly allows himself to be found fault with, but, on the contrary, we seek one subterfuge after another, under which to shelter ourselves. Now Paul says, and not without reason, that in this way we wage war against God; for nothing does God more require from us than this — that we adhere strictly to everything that he declares in his word. Do not those, then, who use subterfuges,   			  <a name="fr_590"></a><a href="#fn_590"><font size="1">591</font></a>
  			  in order that they may be at liberty to transgress the commandment of God, arm themselves openly against God?

 <p><a name="xvii.iv-p37"></a><b>23.</b> <i>All things are lawful for me</i>  Again he returns to the right of Christian liberty, by which the Corinthians defended themselves, and sets aside their objection by giving the same explanation as before. “To eat of meats that were sacrificed, and be present 			 at the banquet, was an outward thing, and therefore was in itself lawful.” Paul declares that he does not by any means call this in question, but he replies, that we must have a regard to edification. <i>All things are lawful for me</i>, says he, <i>but all things are not profitable</i>, that is, for our neighbors, for no one, as he immediately adds, ought to seek his own advantage exclusively, and if anything is not profitable to the brethren, it must be abstained from. He, in the next place, expresses the kind of advantage — when it <i>edifies</i>, for we must not have respect merely to the advantage of the flesh. 			 “What then?   			  <a name="fr_593"></a><a href="#fn_593"><font size="1">594</font></a>
  			  Does a thing that is in other respects permitted by God, come on this account to be unlawful — if it is not expedient for our neighbor. Then in that <i>case </i>our liberty would be placed under subjection to men.” Consider attentively Paul’s words, and you will perceive that liberty, nevertheless, remains unimpaired, when you accommodate yourself to your neighbors, and that 			 it is only the use of it that is restricted, for he acknowledges that it is <i>lawful</i>, but says that it ought not to be made use of, if it does not <i>edify</i></p>

 <p><a name="xvii.iv-p40"></a><b>24.</b> <i>Let no one seek his own.</i> He handles the same subject in the 14th Chapter of the Romans. <i>Let no one please himself</i>,<i> but endeavor to please his brethren for their edification</i>  This is a precept that is very necessary, for we are so corrupted by nature, that every one consults his own interests, regardless of those of his brethren. Now, as the law of love calls upon us to <i>love our neighbors as ourselves</i>, (<a name="xvii.iv-p40.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#039">Mt 22:39</a><a name="xvii.iv-p40.1"></a>,) so it requires us to consult their welfare. The Apostle, however, does not expressly forbid individuals to consult their own advantage, but he requires that they should not be so devoted to their own interests, as not to be prepared to forego part of their right, as often as the welfare of their brethren requires this.</p>  <a name="xvii.v"></a>

 <p><a name="xvii.v-p22"></a><b>25.</b><i> Whatsoever is sold in the shambles</i>  He has spoken above of dissembling in connection with idolatry, or, at least, as to those actions which the Corinthians could not engage in, without professing themselves to be the associates of the wicked in their superstitions. He now requires 			 them, not merely to abstain from all professions of idolatry, but also to avoid carefully all occasions of offense, which are wont to arise from the indiscriminate use of things indifferent. For, although there was but one kind of offense on the part of the Corinthians,   			  <a name="fr_594"></a><a href="#fn_594"><font size="1">595</font></a>
  			  there were, at the same time different degrees of it. Now, as to the eating of food, he makes, in the <i>first </i>place, this general statement — that it is lawful to eat, with a safe <i>conscience</i>, any kind of food, because the Lord permits it. In the <i>second 			 </i>place, he restricts this liberty as to the use of it — lest weak consciences should be injured. Thus this conclusion is divided into two parts the <i>first </i>relates to liberty and power as to things indifferent: the <i>second </i>to a limitation of it — that the use of it may be regulated in accordance with the rule of love.</p>

  			  Accordingly, in so far as concerns a distinction of meats, he frees our consciences from all scruple and hesitation; because it is proper that, when we are certain from the word of the Lord that he approves of what we do, we should have ease and tranquillity in our minds.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.v-p28"></a><i>For conscience sake</i> — that is to say, Before the judgment-seat of God — “In so far as you have to do with God, there is no occasion for your disputing with yourself, whether it be lawful or not.

But it will be asked by some one, “What has this to do with the point?” I answer, If <i>the fullness of the earth</i>   			  <a name="fr_598"></a><a href="#fn_598"><font size="1">599</font></a>
  			 <i> is the Lord’s</i>, there is nothing in the world that is not sacred and pure. We must always keep in view, what the question is of which the Apostle treats. It might be doubted, whether the creatures of God were polluted by the sacrifices of the wicked. Paul says they are not, inasmuch as the rule and possession of the whole earth remain always in the 			 hands of God. Now, what things the Lord has in his hands, he preserves by his power, and consequently sanctifies them. The sons of God, therefore, have the pure use of everything, because they receive them no otherwise than from the hand of God.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.v-p32"></a>The <i>fullness of the earth</i>,   			  <a name="fr_599"></a><a href="#fn_599"><font size="1">600</font></a>
  			  is an expression which is made use of by the Prophet to denote the abundance of blessings, with which the earth is furnished and adorned by the Lord. For if the earth were stripped of trees, herbs, animals, and other things, it would be like a house devoid of furniture and every kind of utensil: nay more, it would be mutilated and disfigured. Should any one object, that the earth is cursed on account of sin, the answer is easy — that he has 			 an eye to its pure and perfect nature, because Paul is speaking of believers, to whom all things are sanctified through Christ.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xvii.v-p34"></a><a name="xvii.v-p34.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.v-p35"></a><b>27.</b> <i>If any one of them that believe not invites you.</i> Here follows an exception, to this effect, that if a believer has been warned, that what is set before him has been offered to an idol, and sees that there is a danger of offense being given, he sins against the brethren if he does 			 not abstain. He shows then, in short, that care must be taken not to hurt weak consciences.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.v-p36"></a>When he says — <i>and you are willing to go</i>, he intimates indirectly, that he does not altogether approve of it, and that it would be better if they declined, but as it is a thing indifferent, he does not choose to forbid it absolutely. And, certainly, there could be nothing better than to 			 keep at a distance from such snares — not that those are expressly to be condemned, who accommodate themselves to men only in so far as conscience permits,   			  <a name="fr_600"></a><a href="#fn_600"><font size="1">601</font></a>
  			  but because it becomes us to proceed with caution,   			  <a name="fr_601"></a><a href="#fn_601"><font size="1">602</font></a>

 <p><a name="xvii.v-p40"></a><b>29.</b> <i>Conscience, I say, not thine own</i>  He always carefully takes heed not to diminish liberty, or to appear to take from it in any degree. “Thou oughtest to bear with the weak conscience of thy brother, that thou mayest not abuse thy right, so as to give occasion 			 of offense to him; but in the meantime thy conscience remains, nevertheless, free, because it is exempted from that subjection. Let not, therefore, the restraint which I impose upon thee as to outward use, become by any means a snare to entangle thy conscience.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.v-p41"></a>It must be observed here, that the term <i>conscience</i> is taken here in its strict acceptation; for in <a name="xvii.v-p41.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#005">Ro 13:5</a><a name="xvii.v-p41.1"></a>, and <a name="xvii.v-p41.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#005">1Ti 1:5</a><a name="xvii.v-p41.2"></a>, it is taken in a larger sense. “We ought, says Paul, to obey princes, <i>not merely for the sake of wrath</i>,<i> but also for that of conscience</i>” — that is, not merely from fear of punishment, but because the Lord orders it so, and it is our duty. Is it not reasonable, too, that we should for the same reason 			 accommodate ourselves to weak brethren — that is, because we are to this extent subject to them in the sight of God? Farther, <i>the end of the commandment is love out of a good conscience</i>  Is not the affection of <i>love</i> included in a 			 <i>good conscience?</i> Hence its meaning here is, as I have already stated, more restricted, inasmuch as the soul of a pious man looks exclusively to the tribunal of God, has no regard to men, is satisfied with the blessing of liberty procured for it by Christ, and is bound to no individuals, and to no circumstances of time or place.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.v-p42"></a>Some manuscripts repeat the statement — <i>The earth is the Lord’s.</i> But the probability is, that some reader having put it on the margin, it had crept into the text.   			  <a name="fr_602"></a><a href="#fn_602"><font size="1">603</font></a>
  			  It is not, however, a matter of great importance.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvii.v-p44"></a><i>For why is my liberty</i>  It is doubtful, whether Paul speaks in this way of himself, or whether he makes this objection in the name of the Corinthians. If we take it as spoken in his own name, it will be a confirmation of the preceding statement. “In restricting 			 yourself, for the sake of another man’s conscience, your liberty is not thereby made subject to him.” If in the name of the Corinthians, the meaning will be this: “You impose upon us an unjust law, in requiring that our liberty should stand or fall at the caprice of others.” I am of opinion, that Paul says this of himself, but explains it in another way, for hitherto I have been stating the views of others. To be <i>judged</i>, then, I explain here as meaning — to be <i>condemned</i>, agreeably to the common acceptation of the word in Scripture. Paul warns us of the danger that must ensue, if we make use of our liberty unreservedly, so as to give occasion of offense to our neighbors — that they 			 will <i>condemn </i>it. Thus, through our fault, and our unreasonableness, the consequence will be, that this special benefit from God will be <i>condemned</i>  If we do not guard against this danger, we corrupt our liberty by our abuse of it. This consideration, then, tends very much to confirm Paul’s exhortation.</p>

 <p><a name="xvii.v-p46"></a><b>30.</b> <i>If therefore by grace.</i> This argument is similar to the preceding one, or nearly so. “As it is owing to the kindness of God that <i>all things are lawful for 			 me,</i> why should I act in such a manner, that it should be reckoned to my account as a vice?” We cannot, it is true, prevent the wicked from reviling us, nor even the weak from being sometimes displeased with us; but Paul here reproves the forwardness of those, who of their own accord give occasion of offense, and hurt weak consciences, when neither necessity or expediency calls for it. He would have us, then, make a good use of our 			 benefits,   			  <a name="fr_603"></a><a href="#fn_603"><font size="1">604</font></a>
  			  that the weak may not have occasion of reviling from our inconsiderate use of liberty.</p>

 <p><a name="xvii.v-p49"></a><b>31.</b> <i>Whether, therefore, ye eat, or drink</i>  Lest they should think, that in so small a matter they should not be so careful to avoid blame, he teaches that there is no part of our life, and no action so minute,   			  <a name="fr_604"></a><a href="#fn_604"><font size="1">605</font></a>
  			  that it ought not to be directed to the glory of God, and that we must take care that, even in eating and drinking, we may aim at the advancement of it. This statement is connected with what goes before; for if we are eagerly desirous of the glory of God, as it becomes us to be, we will never allow, so far as we can prevent it, his benefits to lie under reproach. It was well expressed anciently in a common proverb, that we must not <i>live to 			 eat</i>; but <i>eat to live</i>    			  <a name="fr_605"></a><a href="#fn_605"><font size="1">606</font></a>
  			  Provided the end of living be at the same time kept in view, the consequence will thus be, that our food will be in a manner sacred to God, inasmuch as it will be set apart for his service.</p>

 <p><a name="xvii.v-p53"></a><b>32.</b> <i>Be not occasions of stumbling to any</i>  This is the <i>second </i>point, which it becomes us to have an eye to — the rule of love. A desire, then, for the glory of 			 God, holds the <i>first </i>place; a regard to our neighbor holds the <i>second</i>  He makes mention of <i>Jews and Gentiles</i>, not merely because the Church of God consisted of those two classes, but to teach us that we are 			 debtors to all, even to strangers, that we may, if possible, <i>gain </i>them.

It is, however, more than certain, that Paul accommodated himself to men only in things indifferent, and in things lawful in themselves. Farther, the end must be carefully observed — <i>that they may be saved</i>  Hence what is opposed to their salvation ought not to be conceded to them,   			  <a name="fr_606"></a><a href="#fn_606"><font size="1">607</font></a>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="xvii.v-p57"></a> The view here given by Calvin of the spirit by which Paul was actuated in this part of his conduct, is most successfully brought out, at greater length, by the Reverend Andrew Fuller, when comparing <a name="xvii.v-p57.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#033">1Co 10:33</a><a name="xvii.v-p57.1"></a>, with <a name="xvii.v-p57.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#010">Ga 1:10</a><a name="xvii.v-p57.2"></a>. — “Though both these kinds of 				  action are expressed by one term — to <i>please</i> — <i>yet </i>they are exceedingly diverse; no less so than a conduct which has the glory of God and the good of mankind for its object, and one that originates and terminates in self. The former of these passages should be read in connection with what precedes and follows it, (<a name="xvii.v-p57.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#031">1Co 10:31-33</a><a name="xvii.v-p57.3"></a>.) Hence it appears plain, that the <i>things 				  </i>in which the Apostle <i>pleased all</i>,<i> men</i>, require to be restricted to such things as tend to their ‘profit, that they may be sav<i>ed</i>.’ Whereas the things in which, according to the latter passage, he could <i>not </i>please men, and yet be the servant of Christ, were of a contrary tendency. Such were the objects pursued by the false teachers whom he opposed, and who desired to ‘make a fair show in the flesh, lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of 				  Christ.’ (<a name="xvii.v-p57.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#012">1Co 6:12</a><a name="xvii.v-p57.4"></a>.) The <i>former </i>is that sweet inoffensiveness of spirit which teaches us to lay aside all selfwill and self-importance, that charity which ‘seeketh not her own,’ and ‘is not easily provoked;’ it is that spirit, in short, which the same writer elsewhere recommends from the example of Christ himself: ‘We, then, who are strong, ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and 				  not to please ourselves. Let every one of us please his neighbor, for his good to edification: for even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.’ But the <i>l</i>a<i>tter </i>spirit referred to is that sordid compliance with the corruptions of human nature, of which flatterers and deceivers have always availed themselves, not for the glory of God or the good of men, but for the promotion of their own selfish designs.” — 				  <i>Fullers</i> <i>Works</i>, volume 3. — <i>Ed</i>.</p>
