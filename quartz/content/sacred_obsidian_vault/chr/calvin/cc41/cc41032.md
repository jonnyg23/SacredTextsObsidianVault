 <p><a name="vi.vi-p3"></a><b>1 </b>Children, obey your parents in the Lord; for this is right.</p>    
 <p><a name="vi.vi-p4"></a><b>2 </b>Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with promise;)</p>    
 <p><a name="vi.vi-p5"></a><b>3 </b>That it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest be long-lived on the earth.</p>    
 <p><a name="vi.vi-p6"></a><b>4 </b>Ye fathers also, provoke not your children to wrath; but bring them up in the instruction and reproof of the Lord.</p>    
 <p><a name="vi.vi-p7"></a><b>5 </b>Servants, obey your masters   	  <a name="fr_230"></a><a href="#fn_230"><font size="1">231</font></a>
  	  according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in the simplicity of your hearts, as to Christ;</p>    
 <p><a name="vi.vi-p9"></a><b>6 </b>Not with eye-service, as endeavoring to please men, but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart:   	  <a name="fr_231"></a><a href="#fn_231"><font size="1">232</font></a>
 </p>    
 <p><a name="vi.vi-p11"></a><b>7 </b>With good-will, serving the Lord, and not men;</p>    
 <p><a name="vi.vi-p12"></a><b>8 </b>Knowing that everyone, whether he be bond or free, shall receive from the Lord whatever good he shall have done.</p>    
 <p><a name="vi.vi-p13"></a><b>9 </b>And ye, masters, perform your mutual duty toward them, forbearing threatenings; knowing that their Master and yours is in heaven; and there is no respect of persons with him.</p>    
 <p><a name="vi.vi-p14"></a><b>10 </b>Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.</p>    
 <p><a name="vi.vi-p15"></a><b>11 </b>Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand against the crafty devices of the devil.</p>    
 <p><a name="vi.vi-p16"></a><b>12 </b>For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the princes of the world, of the darkness of this age, against spiritual wickednesses in heavenly places.</p>    
 <p><a name="vi.vi-p17"></a><b>13 </b>Wherefore take to you the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to resist in the evil day, and, having accomplished everything: to stand.</p>    
 <p><a name="vi.vi-p18"></a><b>14 </b>Stand therefore, having your loins girt with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness,</p>    
 <p><a name="vi.vi-p19"></a><b>15 </b>And having your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;</p>    
 <p><a name="vi.vi-p20"></a><b>16 </b>Above all, taking the shield of faith, by which ye may be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one.</p>    
 <p><a name="vi.vi-p21"></a><b>17 </b>And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God;</p>    
 <p><a name="vi.vi-p22"></a><b>18 </b>Praying at all times in the Spirit, with all prayer and supplication, and watching for this very purpose, with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;</p>    
 <p><a name="vi.vi-p23"></a><b>19 </b>And for me, that speech may be given to me, in the opening of my mouth with boldness, that I may make known the mystery of the gospel;   	  <a name="fr_232"></a><a href="#fn_232"><font size="1">233</font></a>
 </p>    
 <p><a name="vi.vi-p26"></a><b>20 </b>For which I discharge the office of ambassador, in the chain; that I may conduct myself in it courageously, as I ought to speak.</p>    
 <p><a name="vi.vi-p27"></a><b>21 </b>But that ye also may know my affairs, what I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, will make known to you all things;</p>    
 <p><a name="vi.vi-p28"></a><b>22 </b>Whom I have sent to you for that purpose, that ye might know my affairs, and might comfort your hearts.</p>    
 <p><a name="vi.vi-p29"></a><b>23 </b>Peace (be) to the brethren, and love, with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>    
 <p><a name="vi.vi-p30"></a><b>24 </b>Grace (be) with all who love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen.</p>
