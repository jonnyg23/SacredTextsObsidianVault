 <p><a name="xiii.ii-p2"></a><b>1. </b>Come, and let us return unto the Lord: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.</p>

 <p><a name="xiii.ii-p4"></a> </p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiii.ii-p5"></a><a name="xiii.ii-p5.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ii-p6"></a>In the last chapter the Prophet said, that the Israelites, after having been subdued by chastisements and judgments, would again turn back from following error to seek God. But as terror drives men away from approaching God, he now adds, that the measure of afflictions would not be such as would discourage their minds and produce despair; but rather inspire them with the assurance, that God would be propitious to them: and 			 that he might set this forth the better, he introduces them as saying, <i>Come, let us go to the Lord:</i> and this mode of speaking is very emphatical.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ii-p7"></a>But we must know that the reason here given, why the Israelites could return safely and with sure confidence to God, is, that they would acknowledge it as his office to heal after he has smitten, and to bring a remedy for the wounds which he has inflicted. The Prophet means by these words, that God does not so punish men as to pour forth his wrath upon them for their destruction; but that he intends, on the contrary, to 			 promote their salvation, when he is severe in punishing their sins. We must then remember, as we have before observed, that the beginning of repentance is a sense of God’s mercy; that is, when men are persuaded that God is ready to give pardon, they then begin to gather courage to repent; otherwise perverseness will ever increase in them; how much soever their sin may frighten them, they will yet never return to the Lord. And for this purpose I have elsewhere quoted that remarkable passage in <a name="xiii.ii-p7.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#000">Psalm 130</a><a name="xiii.ii-p7.2"></a>, ‘With thee is mercy, that thou mayest be feared;’ for it cannot be, that men will obey God with true and sincere heart, except a taste of his goodness allures them, and they can certainly determine, that they shall not return to him in vain, but that he will be ready, as we have said, to pardon them. This is the meaning of the words, when he says, 			 <i>Come, and let us turn to the Lord; for he has torn and he will heal us; </i>that is, God has not inflicted on us deadly wounds; but he has smitten, that he might heal.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ii-p8"></a>At the same time, something more is expressed in the Prophet’s words, and it is this, that God never so rigidly deals with men, but that he ever leaves room for his grace. For by the word, <i>torn,</i> the Prophet alludes to that heavy judgment of which he had before spoken in the person of God: the Lord then made himself to be like a cruel wild beast, “I will be as a lion, I will devour, I will tear, and no one shall take away the prey which 			 I have once seized.” God wished then to show that his vengeance would be dreadful against the Israelites. Now, though God should deal very sharply with them, they were not yet to despair of pardon. However, then, we may find God to be for a time like a lion or a bear, yet, as his proper office is to heal after he has torn, to bind the wounds he has inflicted, there is no reason why we should shun his presence. We see that the design of the Prophet’s words was to show, that no chastisement is so 			 severe that it ought to break down our spirits, but that we ought, by entertaining hope, to stir up ourselves to repentance. This is the drift of the passage.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ii-p9"></a>It is further needful to observe, that the faithful do here, in the first place, encourage themselves, that they may afterwards lead others with them; for so the words mean. He does not say, “Go, return to Jehovah;” but<i>, Come, let us return unto Jehovah</i> We then see that each one begins with himself; and then 			 that they mutually exhort one another; and this is what ought to be done by us: when any one sends his brethren to God, he does not consult his own good, since he ought rather to show the way. Let every one, then, learn to stimulate himself; and then, let him stretch out his hand to others, that they may follow. We are at the same time reminded that we ought to undertake the care of our brethren; for it would be a shame for any one to be content with his own salvation, and so to neglect his 			 brethren. It is then necessary to join together these two things, — To stir up ourselves to repentance, — and then to try to lead others with us. Let us now proceed —</p>  <a name="xiii.iii"></a>  		   			  				   				
 <p class="TableCaption29"><a name="xiii.iii-p1"></a><a name="xiii.iii-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#002">Hosea 6:2</a><a name="xiii.iii-p1.1"></a></p> 				  			  				   				
 <p><a name="xiii.iii-p2"></a><b>2. </b>After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.</p> 				   				
 <p><a name="xiii.iii-p3"></a><b>2. </b>Vivificabit nos post biduum, die tertio suscitabit nos, et vivemus in conspectu ejus (<i>vel</i>, coram facie ejus.)</p> 				  			   		    		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iii-p4"></a> </p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiii.iii-p5"></a><a name="xiii.iii-p5.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iii-p6"></a>This place the Hebrew writers pervert, for they think that they are yet to be redeemed by the coming of the Messiah; and they imagine that this will be the third day: for God once drew them out of Egypt, this was their first life; then, secondly, he restored them to life when he brought them back from the Babylonish captivity; and when God shall, by the hand of the Messiah, gather them from their dispersion, this, they say, will be the third 			 resurrection. But these are frivolous notions. Not withstanding, this place is usually referred to Christ, as declaring, that God would, after two days, and on the third, raise up his Church; for Christ, we know, did not rise privately for himself, but for his members, inasmuch as he is the first-fruits of them who shall rise. This sense does not seem then unsuitable, that is, that the Prophet here encourages the faithful to entertain hope of salvation, because God would raise up his 			 only-begotten Son, whose resurrection would be the common life of the whole Church.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iii-p7"></a>Yet this sense seems to me rather too refined. We must always mind this, that we fly not in the air. Subtle speculations please at first sight, but afterwards vanish. Let every one, then, who desires to make proficiency in the Scriptures always keep to this rule — to gather from the Prophets and apostles only what is solid.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iii-p8"></a>Let us now see what the Prophet meant. He here adds, I doubt not, a second source of consolation, that is, that if God should not immediately revive his people, there would be no reason for delay to cause weariness, as it is wont to do; for we see that when God suffers us to languish long, our spirits fail; and those who at first seem cheerful and courageous enough, in process of time become faint. As, then, patience is a 			 rare virtue, Hosea here exhorts us patiently to bear delay, when the Lord does not immediately revive us. Thus then did the Israelites say, <i>After two days will God revive us; on the third day he will raise us up to life</i></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iii-p9"></a>What did they understand by two days? Even their long affliction; as though they said, “Though the Lord may not deliver us from our miseries the first day, but defer longer our redemption, our hope ought not yet to fail; for God can raise up dead bodies from their graves no less than restore life in a moment.” When Daniel meant to show that the affliction of the people would be long, he says,</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="xiii.iii-p10"></a>‘After a time, times, and half time,’ (<a name="xiii.iii-p10.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025">Da 7:25</a><a name="xiii.iii-p10.1"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iii-p11"></a>That mode of speaking is different, but then as to sense it is the same. He says, ‘after a time,’ that is, after a year; that would be tolerable: but it follows, ‘and times,’ that is, many years: God afterwards shortens that period, and brings redemption at a time when least expected. Hosea mentions here two years, because God would not afflict his people for one day, but, as we have before seen, subdue them by degrees; 			 for the perverseness of the people had so prevailed, that they could not be soon healed. As when diseases have been striking roots for a long time, they cannot be immediately cured, but there is need of slow and various remedies; and were a physician to attempt immediately to remove a disease which had taken full possession of a man, he certainly would not cure him, but take away his life: so also, when the Israelites, through their long obstinacy, had become nearly incurable, it was necessary 			 to lead them to repentance by slow punishments. They therefore said, <i>After two days God will revive us;</i> and thus they confirmed themselves in the hope of salvation, though it did not immediately appear: though they long remained in darkness, and the exile was long which they had to endure, they yet did not cease to hope: “Well, let the two days pass, and the Lord will revive 			 us.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iii-p12"></a>We see that a consolation is here opposed to the temptations, which take from us the hope of salvation, when God suspends his favor longer than our flesh desires. Martha said to Christ, ‘He is now putrid, it is the fourth day.’   			  <a name="fr_26"></a><a href="#fn_26"><font size="1">27</font></a>
  			  She thought it absurd to remove the stone from the sepulchre, because now the body of Lazarus was putrified. But Christ in this instance designed to show his own incredible power by restoring a putrid body to life. So the faithful say here, <i>The Lord will raise us up after two days:</i> “Though exile seems to be like the sepulchre, where putridity awaits us, yet the Lord will, by 			 his ineffable power, overcome whatever may seem to obstruct our restoration.” We now perceive, as I think, the simple and genuine sense of this passage.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iii-p14"></a>But at the same time I do not deny but that God has exhibited a remarkable and a memorable instance of what is here said in his only-begotten Son. As often then as delay begets weariness in us, and when God seems to have thrown aside every care of us, let us flee to Christ; for, as it has been said, His resurrection is a mirror of our life; for we see in that how God is wont to deal with his own people: the Father did not restore life to 			 Christ as soon as he was taken down from the cross; he was deposited in the sepulchre, and he lay there to the third day. When God then intends that we should languish for a time, let us know that we are thus represented in Christ our head, and hence let us gather materials of confidence. We have then in Christ an illustrious proof of this prophecy. But in the first place, let us lay hold on what we have said, that the faithful here obtain hope for themselves, though God extends not immediately 			 his hand to them, but defers for a time his grace of redemption.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iii-p15"></a>Then he adds, <i>We shall live in his sight,</i> or <i>before him</i>. Here again the faithful strengthen themselves, for God would favor them with his paternal countenance, after he had long turned his back on them, <i>We shall live before his 			 face</i>  For as long as God cares not for us, a sure destruction awaits us; but as soon as he turns his eyes to us, he inspires life by his look alone. Then the faithful promise this good to themselves that God’s face will shine again after long darkness: hence also they gather the hope of life, and at the same time withdraw themselves from all those obstacles which obscure the light of life; for while we run and wander here and there, 			 we cannot lay hold on the life which God promises to us, as the charms of this world are so many veils, which prevent our eyes to see the paternal face of God. We must then remember that this sentence is added, that the faithful, when it pleases God to turn his back on them, may not doubt but that he will again look on them. Let us now go on —</p>  <a name="xiii.iv"></a>  		   			  				   				
 <p class="TableCaption29"><a name="xiii.iv-p1"></a><a name="xiii.iv-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#003">Hosea 6:3</a><a name="xiii.iv-p1.1"></a></p> 				  			  				   				
 <p><a name="xiii.iv-p2"></a><b>3. </b>Then shall we know, <i>if</i> we follow on to know the Lord: his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter <i>and</i> former rain unto the earth.</p> 				   				
 <p><a name="xiii.iv-p3"></a><b>3. </b>Et cognoscemus et persequemur ad cognitionem Jehovae: sicut aurora dispositus est egressus ejus, et veniet tanquam pluvia nobis, tanquam pluvia serotina pluvia terrae.   				   <a name="fr_27"></a><a href="#fn_27"><font size="1">28</font></a>
 </p> 				  			   		    		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iv-p6"></a> </p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiii.iv-p7"></a><a name="xiii.iv-p7.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iv-p8"></a>In this verse the faithful pursue what we have before considered, making the hope of salvation sure to themselves: nor is it a matter of wonder that the Prophet dwells more fully on this subject; for we know how prone we are to entertain doubt. There is nothing more difficult, especially when God shows to us signs of his wrath, than to recover us, so that we may be really persuaded that he is our physician, when he seems to 			 visit us for our sins. We must then, in this case, earnestly strive, for it cannot be done without labour. Hence the faithful now say, <i>We shall know, and we shall pursue to know Jehovah.</i> They show then by these words that they distrust not, but that light would arise after darkness; for this is the meaning of the words: <i>We shall</i> then<i> know,</i> they say; that is, “Though there is now on every side horrible darkness, yet the Lord will manifest his goodness to us, even though it may not immediately appear.” They therefore add, <i>And we shall pursue after the knowledge of Jehovah.</i> We now perceive the purport of the words.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iv-p9"></a>Now this passage teaches us, that when God hides his face, we act foolishly if we cherish our unbelief; for we ought, on the contrary, as I have already said, to contend with this destructive disease, inasmuch as Satan seeks nothing else but to sink us in despair. This his device then ought to be understood by us, as Paul reminds us, (<a name="xiii.iv-p9.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#011">2Co 2:11</a><a name="xiii.iv-p9.1"></a>;) and the Holy Spirit supplies us here with weapons, by which we may repel this temptation of Satan, “What? Thou seest that God is angry with thee; nor is it of any use to thee to attempt to come to him, for every access is shut up.” This is what Satan suggests to us, when we are sensible of our sins. What is to be done? The Prophet here propounds a remedy, <i>We shall know;</i> “Though now we are sunk in thick darkness, though there never shines on us, no, not even a spark of light, yet we shall know (as Isaiah says, ‘I will hope in the Lord, who hides his face from Jacob’)   			  <a name="fr_28"></a><a href="#fn_28"><font size="1">29</font></a>
  			  that this is the true exercise of our faith, when we lift up our eyes to the light which seems to be extinguished, and when in the darkness of death we yet continue to promise to ourselves life, as we are here taught: We shall then <i>know;</i> further, <i>We shall pursue after the knowledge of Jehovah;</i> though 			 God withdraws his face, and, as it were designedly, doubles the darkness, and all knowledge of his grace be, as it were, extinct, we shall yet <i>pursue after this knowledge;</i> that is, no obstacle shall keep us from striving, and our efforts will at length make their way to that grace which seems to be wholly excluded from us.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iv-p11"></a>Some give this rendering, <i>We shall know, and shall pursue on to know Jehovah,</i> and explain the passage thus, — that the Israelites had derived no such benefit from the law of Moses, but that they still expected the fuller doctrine, which Christ brought at his coming. They then think that this is a prophecy 			 respecting that doctrine, which is now by the Gospel set forth to us in its full brightness, because God has manifested himself in his Son as in a living image. But this is too refined an exposition; and it is enough for us to keep close to the design of the Prophet. He indeed introduces the godly thus speaking for this reason — because there was need of great and strong effort, that they might rise up to the hope of salvation; for it was not to be the exile of one day, but of seventy years. 			 When therefore so heavy a trial awaited the godly, the Prophet here wished to prepare them for the laborious warfare: <i>We shall then know, and follow on to know Jehovah</i></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iv-p12"></a>Then he says<i>, As the morning shall come to us his going forth,</i> — a similitude the most appropriate; for here the faithful call to mind the continued succession of days and nights. No wonder that God bids us to hope for his grace, the sight of which is yet hid from us; for except we had learnt by long 			 experience, who could hope for sudden light when the darkness of night prevails? Should we not think that the earth is wholly deprived of light? But seeing that the dawn suddenly shines, and puts an end to the darkness of night, and dispels it, what wonder is it that the Lord should shine forth beyond our expectation? <i>His going forth</i> then <i>shall be like the morning.</i></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iv-p13"></a>He here calls a new manifestation the going forth of God, that is, when God shows that he regards his people with favor, when he shows that he is mindful of the covenant which he made with Abraham; for as long as the people were exiled from their country, God seemed not, as we have said, to look on them any more; nay, the judgment of the flesh only suggested this, that God was far distant from his people. He then calls it 			 the going forth of God, when God should show himself propitious to the captives, and should wholly restore them; then <i>the going forth of God shall come, and shall be like the morning</i>  We now then see that he confirms them by the order of nature, as Paul does, when he chides the unbelief of those to whom a future resurrection seemed incredible, because it surpasses the thoughts of 			 the flesh; “O fool!” he says, “does thou not see that what thou sowest first decays and then germinates? God now sets before thee in a decaying seed an emblem of the future resurrection.” So also in this place, since light daily rises to us, and the morning shines after the darkness of night, what then will not the Lord effect by himself, who works so powerfully by material things? When he will put forth his full power, what, think we, will he do? Will he not much more surpass all the thoughts 			 of our flesh? We now then see why this similitude was added.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iv-p14"></a>He afterwards describes to us the effect of this manifestation, <i>He shall come,</i> he says, <i>as the rain to us, as the late rain, a rain to the earth</i> This comparison shows, that as soon as God will 			 deign to look on his people, his countenance will be like the rain, which irrigates the earth. When the earth is dry after long heat and long drought, it seems to be incapable of producing fruit; but rain restores to it its moisture and vigor. Thus then the Prophet, in the person of the faithful, does here strengthen the hope of a full restoration. <i>He shall come to us as the rain, as the late rain</i></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iv-p15"></a>The Hebrews call the late rain <a name="xiii.iv-p15.2"></a>מלקום, <i>melakush</i>, by which the corn was ripened. And it seems that the Prophet meant the vernal rain by the word <a name="xiii.iv-p15.3"></a>גשם, <i>geshem,</i> But the sense is clearly this, that though the Israelites had become so dry that they had no longer any vigor, there would yet be no less virtue in God’s grace than in the rain, which fructifies the earth when it seems to be barren. But when at the end he adds, <i>a rain to the earth,</i> I doubt not 			 but that he meant seasonable rain, which is pleasant and acceptable to the earth, or which the earth really wants; for a violent shower cannot be called properly a rain to the earth, because it is destructive and hurtful. It follows —</p>  <a name="xiii.v"></a>  		   			  				   				
 <p class="TableCaption29"><a name="xiii.v-p1"></a><a name="xiii.v-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#004">Hosea 6:4</a><a name="xiii.v-p1.1"></a></p> 				  			  				   				
 <p><a name="xiii.v-p2"></a><b>4. </b>O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness <i>is</i> as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away.</p> 				   				
 <p><a name="xiii.v-p3"></a><b>4. </b>Quid faciam tibi Ephraim? quid faciam tibi Jehudah? Nam bonitas vestra est quasi ros matutinus, quasi nebula mane transiens.</p> 				  			   		    		  
 <p><a name="xiii.v-p4"></a> </p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiii.v-p5"></a><a name="xiii.v-p5.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.v-p6"></a>Some so expound this passage as that God would not once irrigate his people, but would continue this favor; as though he said, “He is deceived, who thinks that the redemption, which I bid you to hope from me, will be momentary, for I will, by a continued progress, lead my people to a full fruition of salvation.” But this sense is altogether foreign. The Prophet then, no doubt, introduces God here as speaking thus, “What shall I do to you? 			 because ye cannot receive my favor, so great is your depravity.” The context seems indeed to be in this way broken off; but we must remember this canon, that whenever the Prophets make known the grace of God, they at the same time add an exception, lest hypocrites falsely apply to themselves what is offered to the faithful alone. The Prophets, we know, never threatened ruin to the people, but that they added some promise, lest the faithful should despair, which must have been the case, except 			 some mitigation had been made known to them. Hence the Prophets do this in common, — they moderate their threatening and severity by adding a hope of God’s favor. But at the same time, as hypocrites ever draw to themselves what belongs only to the faithful, and thus heedlessly deride God, the Prophets add another exception, by which they signify, that God’s promise of being gracious and merciful to his people is not to be deemed universal, and as appertaining to all indiscriminately.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.v-p7"></a>I will more fully repeat this again: The Prophets had to do with the whole people; they had to do with the few faithful, for there was a small number of godly people among the Israelites as well as among the Jews. When therefore the Prophets reproved the people, they addressed the whole body: but at the same time, as there was some remnant seed, they mingled, as I have said, consolations, and mingled them, that the elect of God might ever 			 recumb on his mercy, and thus patiently submit to his rod, and continue in his fear, knowing that there is in him a sure salvation. Hence the promises which we see inserted by the Prophets among threats and chidings, ought not to be referred in common to all, or indiscriminately to the people, but only, as we have said, to the faithful, who were then but few in number. This then is the reason why the prophets shook off self-complacencies from the wicked despisers of God, when they added, “Ye 			 ought not to hope any salvation from the promise I set forth to God’s children; for God throws not to dogs the bread which he has destined for his children alone.” In the same strain we find another Prophet speaking,</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="xiii.v-p8"></a>‘To what end is the day of the Lord to you? It is a day of darkness, and not of light, a day of death, and not of life,’ (<a name="xiii.v-p8.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#018">Am 5:18</a><a name="xiii.v-p8.1"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.v-p9"></a>For as often as they heard of the covenant which God made with Abraham, that it would not be void, they thus vaunted, “We are now indeed severely treated, but in a little while God will rescue us from our evils; for he is our Father, he has not in vain adopted us, he has not in vain redeemed and chosen our race, we are his peculiar possession and heritage.” Thus then the presumptuous flatter themselves; and this indeed they seem to have in 			 common with the faithful; for the faithful also, though in the deepest abyss of death, yet behold the light of life; for by faith, as we have said, they penetrate beyond this world. But at the same time they approach God in real penitence, while the ungodly remain in their perverseness, and vainly flatter themselves, thinking that whatever God promises belongs to them.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.v-p10"></a>Let us now then return to our Prophet. He had said, “In their tribulation they will seek me:” he had afterwards, in the words used by the people, explained how the faithful would turn themselves to God, and what true repentance would bring with it. It now follows, <i>What shall I do to thee, Ephraim? what shall I do to thee, Judah? 			 </i>that is, “What shall I do to all of you?” The people was now divided into two kingdoms: the kingdom of Judah had its own name; the ten tribes had, as it has been said, the common name of Israel. Then after the Prophet gave hope of pardon to the children of God, he turns himself to the whole body of the people, which was corrupt, and says, “What shall I do now to you, both Jews and Israelites?” Now God, by these words, intimates that he had tried all remedies, and found 			 them useless: “What more then,” he says, “shall I do to you? Ye are wholly incurable, ye are inexcusable, and altogether past hope; for no means have been omitted by me, by which I could promote your salvation; but I have lost all my labour; as I have effected nothing by punishments and chastisements, as my favor also has had no account among you, what now remains, but that I must wholly cast you away?”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.v-p11"></a>We now then see how varied is the mode of speaking adopted by the Prophets; for they had to do, not with one class of men, but with the children of God, and also with the wicked, who continued obstinately in their vices. Hence then it was, that they changed their language, and so necessarily. Alike is the complaint we read in Isaiah chapter 1,   			  <a name="fr_29"></a><a href="#fn_29"><font size="1">30</font></a>
  			  except that there mention is only made of punishments, ‘Why should I strike you more? for I have hitherto effected nothing: from the sole of the foot to the top of the head there is no soundness; and yet ye remain like yourselves.’ In chapter 5   			  <a name="fr_30"></a><a href="#fn_30"><font size="1">31</font></a>
  			  he speaks of God’s favors, ‘What could have been done more to my vineyard than what I have done?’ In these two places the Prophet shows that the people were so lost, that they could not be brought into a sane mind; for God had in various ways tried to heal them, and their diseases remained incurable.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.v-p14"></a>Let us now return to the words of Hosea, <i>What shall I do to thee, Ephraim? What shall I do to thee Judah?</i> “I indeed offer pardon to all, but ye still continue obstinately in your sins; nay, my favor is by you scorned: I do not therefore now contend with you; but declare to you that the door of salvation is 			 closed.” Why? “Because I have hitherto in various ways tried in vain to heal you.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.v-p15"></a>He afterwards says that their goodness was like the morning dew, <i>Your goodness,</i> he says, is as the dew of the morning.” Some take <a name="xiii.v-p15.1"></a>חסד, <i>chesad,</i> for the 			 kindness which God had exercised towards both the Israelites and the Jews. Then it is, “Your kindness,” that is, the mercy which I have hitherto exhibited to you, <i>is as the morning dew, as the cloud which passes away early in the morning,</i> that is, “Ye immediately dry up my favor;” and this seems not unsuitable, for we see that the unbelieving by their wickedness absorb the mercy 			 of God, so that it produces no good, as when rain flows over a rock or a stone, while the stone within, on account of its hardness, remains dry. As then the moisture of rain does not penetrate into stones, so also the grace of God is spent in vain and without advantage on the unbelieving.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.v-p16"></a>But the Prophet speaks rather of their goodness, that they made a show of feigned excellency, which vanished like the morning dew; for as soon as the sun rises, it draws the dew upwards, so that it appears no more; the clouds also pass away. The Prophet says that the Jews and the Israelites were like the morning clouds and the dew, because there was in them no solid or inward goodness, but it was only of an evanescent kind; they had, as they 			 say, only the appearance of goodness.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.v-p17"></a>We now then perceive the meaning of the Prophet, that God here complains that he had to do with hypocrites. Faith, we know, is regarded by him; there is nothing that pleases God more than sincerity of heart. We know further, that doctrine is spread in vain, except it be received in a serious manner. Then, as hypocrites transform themselves in various ways, and make a display of some guises of goodness, while they have nothing solid in them, 			 God complains that he loses all his labour: and he says at length that he will no longer spend labour in vain on hypocritical men, who have nothing but falsehood and dissimulation; and this is what he means, when he intimates that he should do nothing more to the Israelites and the Jews.</p>  <a name="xiii.vi"></a>

 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiii.viii-p7"></a><a name="xiii.viii-p7.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.viii-p8"></a>God shows here, by his Prophet, that he was constrained by urgent necessity to deal sharply and roughly with the people. Nothing, we know, is more pleasing to God than to treat us kindly; for there is not found a father in the world who cherishes his children as tenderly: but we, being perverse, suffer him not to follow the inclination of his nature. He is therefore constrained to put on, as it were, a new character, and 			 to chide us severely, according to the way in which he here says, he had treated the Israelites; <i>I have cut them, he says, by my prophets, and killed them by the words of my mouth</i></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.viii-p9"></a>Some render the words otherwise, as though God had killed the Prophets, meaning thereby the impostors, who corrupted the pure worship of God by their errors. But this view seems not to me in any way suitable; and we know that it was a common mode of speaking among the Hebrews, to express the same thing in two ways. So the Prophet speaks here, <i>I have 			 cut</i> or <i>hewed</i> <i>them by my Prophets, I have killed them by the cords of my mouth.</i> In the second clause he repeats, I doubt not, what we have already briefly explained, namely, that God had cut or hewed them by his Prophets.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.viii-p10"></a>But we must see for what purpose God declares here that he had commanded his Prophets to treat the people roughly. Hypocrites we indeed know, however much in various ways they mock God, are yet tender, and cannot bear any rebuke. Their sins are gross, except when they disguise themselves; but at the same time, when God begins to reprove, they expostulate and say, “What does this mean? God everywhere declares that he is 			 kind and merciful; but he fulminates now against us: this seems not consistent with his nature.” Thus then hypocrites would have God to be their batterer. He now answers, that he had been constrained, not only for a just cause, but also necessarily, to kill them, and to make his word by the Prophets like a hammer or an ax. This is the reason, he says, why my Prophets have not endeavored mildly and gently to allure the people. For God kindly and sweetly draws or invites to himself those whom he 			 sees to be teachable; but when he sees so great a perverseness in men, that he cannot bend them by his goodness, he then begins, as we have said, to put on a new character. We now then under stand God’s design: that hypocrites might not complain that they had been otherwise treated than what is consistent with God’s nature, the Prophet here answers in God’s name, “Ye have forced me to this severity; for there was need of a hard wedge, as they say, for a hard knot: <i>I have</i> therefore <i>hewed you by my Prophets, I have hewed you by the words of my mouth;</i> that is, I have used my word as an ax: for ye were like knotty and tough wood; it was therefore necessary that my word should be to you like an ax: and I have killed you by the words of my mouth; that is my word has 			 not been sweet food to you, as it is wont to be to meek men; but it has been like a two-edged sword; it was therefore necessary to slay you, as ye would not bear me to be a Father to you.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.viii-p11"></a>It then follows <i>Thy judgments are light that goes forth</i>   Some understand by “judgments” prosperity as if God were here reproaching the Israelites, that it was not his fault that he did not win 			 them: “I have not neglected to treat you kindly, and under my protection to defend you; but ye are ungrateful.” But this is a strained exposition. The greater part of interpreters explain the passage thus, “That thy judgments might be a light going forth.” But I do not see why we should change any thing in the Prophet’s words. God then simply intimates here, that he had made known to the Israelites the rule of a religious and holy life, so that they could not pretend ignorance; for the Hebrews 			 often understand “judgments” in the sense of rectitude. I refer this to the instruction given them: <i>Thy judgments</i> then, that is, the way of living religiously, was like light; which means this, “I have so warned you, that you have sinned knowingly and willfully. Hence, that you have been so disobedient to me, must be imputed to your perverseness; for when ye were pliant, I certainly did not conceal 			 from you what was right: for as the sun daily shines on the earth, so my teaching, has been to you as the light, to show to you the way of salvation; but it has been with no profit.” We now then understand what the Prophet meant by these words. It follows —</p>  <a name="xiii.ix"></a>  		   			  				   				
 <p class="TableCaption29"><a name="xiii.ix-p1"></a><a name="xiii.ix-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#006">Hosea 6:6-7</a><a name="xiii.ix-p1.1"></a></p>

 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiii.ix-p8"></a><a name="xiii.ix-p8.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ix-p9"></a>God in this place declares that he desires mercy, and not sacrifices; and he does so to prevent an objections and to anticipate all frivolous pretenses. There is never wanting to hypocrites, we well know, a cover for themselves; and so great is their assurance, that they hesitate not sometimes to contend with God. It is indeed their common practice to maintain that they worship God, provided they offer sacrifices to him, 			 provided they toil in ceremonies, and accumulate many rites. They think then that God is made bound to them, and that they have fully performed their duty. This evil has been common in all ages. The Prophet therefore anticipates this evasion, and says, <i>Mercy I desire, and not sacrifice;</i> as though he said, “I know what you are ready to allege, and that you will say, that you offer 			 sacrifices to me, that you perform all the ceremonies; but this excuse is deemed by me frivolous and of no moment.” Why? “Because I desire not sacrifices, but mercy and faith.” We now understand the main object of this verse.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ix-p10"></a>It is a remarkable passage; the Son of God has twice quoted it. The Pharisees reproached him for his intercourse with men of bad and abandoned life, and he said to them in Matthew   			  <a name="fr_33"></a><a href="#fn_33"><font size="1">34</font></a>
  			 ‘Mercy I desire, and not sacrifice:’ he shows, by this defense, that God is not worshipped by external ceremonies, but when men forgive and bear with one another, and are not above measure rigid. Again, in the <a name="xiii.ix-p11.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#000">Matthew 12</a><a name="xiii.ix-p11.2"></a>,   			  <a name="fr_34"></a><a href="#fn_34"><font size="1">35</font></a>
  			 when the Pharisees blamed the disciples for gathering ears of corn, he said ‘But rather go and learn what this is, Mercy I desire, and not sacrifice.’ Inasmuch as they were so severe against his disciples, Christ shows that those who make holiness to consist in ceremonies are foolish worshipers of God; and that they also blamed their brethren without a cause, and made a crime of what was not in itself sinful, and what could be easily defended by any wise and calm expounder.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ix-p13"></a>But that we may more fully understand this sentence of the Prophet, it must be observed, firsts that the outward worship of God, and all legal ceremonies, are included under the name of sacrifice and burnt-offerings. These words then comprise a part for the whole. The same may be said of the word <a name="xiii.ix-p13.1"></a>חסד, <i>chesad</i>, which means, mercy or kindness; for the Prophet here, no doubt, sets faith or piety towards God, and love towards neighbors, in opposition to all external ceremonies. “I desire,” he says, “mercy;” or, “mercy pleases me more than sacrifice, and the knowledge of God pleases me more than burnt-offerings.” The knowledge of God here is doubtless to be taken for faith or piety, because hypocrites suppose that God is rightly worshipped when they use many 			 ceremonies. The Prophet derides all such pomp and empty show, and says, that the worshipping of God is far different; it being only done when he is known. The chief point is, that God desires to be worshipped otherwise than sensual men dream; for they only display their rites, and neglect the spiritual worship of God, which stands in faith and love.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ix-p14"></a>These two clauses ought then to be read conjointly — that kindness pleases God — and that faith pleases God. Faith by itself cannot please God, since it cannot even exist without love to our neighbor; and then, human kindness is not sufficient; for were any one to abstain from doing any injury, and from hurting his brethren in any thing, he might be still a profane man, and a despiser of God; and certainly his kindness 			 would be then of no avail to him. We hence see that these two sentences cannot be separated, and that what the Prophet says is equally the same as if he had connected piety with love. The meaning is, that God values faith and kindness much more than sacrifices and all ceremonies. But when the Prophet says that sacrifice does not please God, he speaks, no doubt, comparatively; for God does not positively repudiate sacrifices enjoined in his own law; but he prefers faith and love to them; as we 			 more clearly learn from the particle <a name="xiii.ix-p14.1"></a>מ, <i>mem</i>, when he says, <a name="xiii.ix-p14.2"></a>מעולות<i>, meoulut</i>, than burnt-offerings.” It then appears that God is not inconsistent with himself, as though he rejected sacrifices which he himself 			 had appointed; but that he condemns the preposterous abuse of them, in which hypocrites gloried.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ix-p15"></a>And here two things are to be noticed: God requires not external ceremonies, as if they availed any thing of themselves, but for a different end. Faith of itself pleases God, as also does love; for they are, as they say, of the class of good works: but sacrifices are to be regarded differently; for to kill an ox, or a calf, or a lamb, what is it but to do what the butcher does in his shambles? God then cannot be delighted with the slaughter 			 of beasts; hence sacrifices, as we have said, are of themselves of no account. Faith and love are different. Hence the Lord says, in Jeremiah,</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="xiii.ix-p16"></a>‘Have I commanded your fathers, when I brought them out of Egypt, <br> 			 to offer sacrifices to me?’ <br> 			 [<a name="xiii.ix-p16.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#022">Jer. 7:22</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#000">Jer. 23:0</a><a name="xiii.ix-p16.3"></a>]</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ix-p17"></a>no such thing; ‘I never commanded them,’ he says, ‘but only to hear my voice.’ But what does the law in great measure contain except commands about ceremonies? The answer to this is easy, and that is, that sacrifices never pleased God through their own or intrinsic value, as if they had any worth in them. What then? Even this, that faith and piety are approved, and have ever been the legitimate spiritual worship of God. This is one thing. It 			 is further to be noticed, that when the Prophets reprove hypocrites, they regard what is suitable to them, and do not specifically explain the matters which they handle. Isaiah says in one place, ‘He who kills an ox does the same as if he had killed a dog,’ and a dog was the highest abomination;</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="xiii.ix-p18"></a>‘nay, they who offer sacrifices do the same <br> 			 as if they had killed men,’ (<a name="xiii.ix-p18.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#003">Isa 66:3</a><a name="xiii.ix-p18.2"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ix-p19"></a>What! to compare sacrifices with murders! This seems very strange; but the Prophet directed his discourse to the ungodly, who then abused the whole outward worship prescribed by the law: no wonder then that he thus spake of sacrifices. In the same manner also ought many other passages to be explained, which frequently occur in the Prophets. We now then see that God does not simply reject sacrifices, as far as he has enjoined them, but only 			 condemns the abuse of them. And hence what I have already said ought to be remembered, that the Prophet here sets external rites in opposition to piety and faith, because hypocrites tear asunder things which are, as it were, inseparable: it is an impious divorce, when any one only obtrudes ceremonies on God, while he himself is void of piety. But as this disease commonly prevails among men, the Prophet adds a contrast between this fictitious worship and true religion. It is also worthy of being 			 observed, that he calls faith the knowledge of God. We then see that faith is not some cold and empty imagination, but that it extends much farther; for it is then that we have faith, when the will of God is made known to us, and we embrace it, so that we worship him as our Father. Hence the knowledge of God is required as necessary to faith. The Papists then talk very childishly about implicit faith: when a man understands nothing, and has not even the least acquaintance with God, they yet say 			 that he is endued with implicit faith. This is a romance more than foolish; for where there is no knowledge of God, there is no religion, piety is extinct and faith is destroyed, as it appears evident from this passage.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiii.ix-p20"></a><a name="xiii.ix-p20.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ix-p21"></a>God then subjoins a complaint, — <i>But they like men have transgressed the covenant; there have they dealt treacherously against me</i>. Here God shows that the Israelites boasted in vain of their sacrifices and of all the pomps of their external worship, for God did not regard these external things, but only wished to exercise the 			 faithful in spiritual worship. Then the import of the whole is this, “My design was, when I appointed the sacrifices and the whole legal worship, to lead you so to myself, that there might be nothing carnal or earthly in your sacrificing; but ye have corrupted the whole law; you have been perverse interpreters; for sacrifices have been nothing else among you but mockery as if it were a satisfaction to me to have an ox or a ram killed. You have then transgressed my covenant; and it is nothing 			 that the people say to me, that they have diligently performed the outward ceremonies, for such a worship is not in the least valued by me.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ix-p22"></a>And he proceeds still farther and says, <i>There have they dealt treacherously against me</i>. He had said before, ‘They have transgressed the covenant;’ as though he said, “If they wished to keep my covenant, this was the first thing, — to worship me spiritually, even in faith and love; but they, having despised true worship, laid hold 			 only on what was frivolous: they have therefore violated my covenant.” But now he adds, that “there” appeared their perfidy; yea, that they were convicted of violating their faith, and shown to be covenant-breakers, by this, — that they abused the sacred marks by which God had sanctioned his covenant, to cover their own perfidy. There is then great importance in the adverb <a name="xiii.ix-p22.1"></a>שם, 			 <i>shim</i>, as if he had said, “In <i>that</i> particular you have acted perfidiously:” for the Prophet means, that when hypocrites especially raise their crests, they are convicted of falsehood and perjury. But how? Because they set forth their own ceremonies, as we see them introduced as speaking thus in <a name="xiii.ix-p22.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#000">Isaiah 58</a><a name="xiii.ix-p22.2"></a>,   			  <a name="fr_35"></a><a href="#fn_35"><font size="1">36</font></a>
  			  ‘Wherefore have we fasted, and thou hast not regarded?’ In this passage they accuse God of too much rigor, because they lost all their toil when they worshipped so laboriously, “We have then in vain spent labour and so diligently worshipped him.” God answers: ‘Who has required this at your hands?’ So also in this place the Prophet says, and more sharply, <i>There have they dealt 			 treacherously against me</i>: that is, “They think that my mouth would be stopped by this defense only, when they brought forward their sacrifices, and, after their manner, made a great display, as if they were the best observers of religion; but I will show that in this very thing they are covenant-breakers.” How? “Because there is no falsehood worse than to turn the truth of God into a lie, and to adulterate his pure doctrine.” And this is what all hypocrites 			 do, when they thus turn sacraments into gross abuses and false worship, when they build temples, when they imagine that God is rightly worshipped whenever an ox or a ram is offered. Since then hypocrites so grossly mock God and turn away sacrifices from Christ, they turn away from the doctrine of repentance and faith; in a word, they regard God only as a dead idol. When then they thus deprave the whole worship of God and adulterate it, when they so impiously corrupt the word of God and pervert 			 his institutions, are they not covenant-breakers? <i>There then they perfidiously acted against me</i>. This ought to be carefully observed, because it has not been noticed by interpreters.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ix-p24"></a>Some thus render the word <a name="xiii.ix-p24.1"></a>אדם, <i>adam</i>, — “As the covenant of man have they transgressed it,” transferring it to the genitive case, “And they have transgressed the covenants as if it was that of man;” that is, as if they had to do with a mortal man, so have they despised 			 and violated my holy covenant; and this exposition is not very unsuitable, except that it somewhat changes the construction; for in this case the Prophet ought to have said, “They have transgressed the covenant as that of a man;” but he says, ‘They as a man,’ etc.   			  <a name="fr_36"></a><a href="#fn_36"><font size="1">37</font></a>
  			  But this rendering is far from being that of the words as they are, ‘They as men have transgressed the covenant.’ I therefore interpret the words more simply, as meaning, that they showed themselves to be men in violating the covenant.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ix-p26"></a>And there is here an implied contrast or comparison between God and the Israelites; as though he said, “I have in good faith made a covenant with them, when I instituted a fixed worship; but they have been men towards me; there has been in them nothing but levity and inconstancy.” God then shows that there had not been a mutual concord between him and the Israelites, as men never respond to God; for he sincerely calls them to himself, but 			 they act unfaithfully, or when they have given some proof of obedience, they soon turn back again, or despise and openly reject the offered instruction. We then see in what sense the Prophet says that they had transgressed the covenant of God as men.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ix-p27"></a>Others explain the words thus, “They have transgressed as Adam the covenant.” But the word, Adam, we know, is taken indefinitely for men. This exposition is frigid and diluted, “They have transgressed as Adam the covenant;” that is, they have followed or imitated the example of their father Adam, who had immediately at the beginning transgressed God’s commandment. I do not stop to refute this comment; for we see that it is in itself vapid. 			 Let us now proceed —</p>  <a name="xiii.x"></a>  		   			  				   				
 <p class="TableCaption29"><a name="xiii.x-p1"></a><a name="xiii.x-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#008">Hosea 6:8</a><a name="xiii.x-p1.1"></a></p>

 <p><a name="xiii.x-p4"></a> </p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiii.x-p5"></a><a name="xiii.x-p5.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.x-p6"></a>I shall first speak of the subject, and then something shall be added in its place of the words. The Prophet here notices, no doubt, something special against Gilead, which through the imperfection of history is now to us obscure. But in the first place, we must remember, that Gilead was one of the cities of refuge; and the Levites possessed these cities, which were destined for fugitives. If any one killed a man by chance, that the relatives 			 might not take revenge, the Lord provided that he should flee to one of these cities appointed for his safety. He was there safe among the Levites: and the Levites received him under their protection, the matter being previously tried; for a legal hearing of the cause must have preceded as to whether he who had killed a man was innocent. We must then first remember that this city was occupied by the Levites and the priests; and they ought to have been examples to all others; for as Christ calls 			 his disciples the light of the world, so the Lord had chosen the priests for this purpose, that they might carry a torch before all the people. Since then the highest sanctity ought to have shone forth in the priests, it was quite monstrous that they were like robbers, and that the holy city, which was as it were the sanctuary of God, became a den of thieves.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.x-p7"></a>It was then for this reason that the Prophet especially inveighs against the city Gilead, and says <i>Gilead is a city of the workers of iniquity, and is covered with blood</i>  But if Gilead was so corrupt, what must have been the case with the other cities? It is then the same as if the Prophet had said, “Where shall 			 I begin? If I reprove the people indiscriminately, the priests will then think that they are spared, because they are innocent; yea, that they are wholly without blame: nay,” he says, “the priests are the most abandoned, they are even the ringleaders of robbers. Since then so great corruptions prevail among the order of priests, in whom the highest sanctity ought to have shone forth, how great must be the licentiousness of the people in all kinds of wickedness? And then what must be said of 			 other cities, since Gilead is so bad, which God has consecrated for a peculiar purpose, that it might be a sort of sanctuary? Since then Gilead is a den of robbers, what must be the other cities?” We now comprehend the meaning of the Prophet.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.x-p8"></a>“Polluted with blood,” <a name="xiii.x-p8.1"></a>עקובה מדם, <i>okube medam: </i><a name="xiii.x-p8.2"></a>עקב<i>, okob,</i> in Hebrew, means “to deceive,” and also, “to hold” or “retain.” <a name="xiii.x-p8.3"></a>עקב, <i>okob,</i> is the sole of the foot; hence <a name="xiii.x-p8.4"></a>עקב, <i>okob,</i> signifies “to supplant.” And there is no doubt but that “to deceive” is its meaning metaphorically. I will now come to the meaning of the Prophet; he says that the city 			 was <a name="xiii.x-p8.5"></a>עקובה מדם, <i>okube, medan</i>; some say, “deceptive in blood,” because they did not openly kill men, but by lying in wait for them; and hence they elicit this sense. But I approve more of what they hold who say, that the city was “full of blood;” not that such is the strict sense of the Hebrew word; but we may properly render it, “occupied by 			 blood.” Why so? Because <a name="xiii.x-p8.6"></a>עקב, <i>okob</i>, as I have said, means sometimes to hold, to stay, and to hinder. We may then properly and fitly say, that Gilead was “occupied” or “possessed by blood.” But here follows a clearer and a fuller explanation of this sentence —</p>  <a name="xiii.xi"></a>  		   			  				   				
 <p class="TableCaption29"><a name="xiii.xi-p1"></a><a name="xiii.xi-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#009">Hosea 6:9</a><a name="xiii.xi-p1.1"></a></p> 				  			  				   				
 <p><a name="xiii.xi-p2"></a><b>9. </b>And as troops of robbers wait for a man, <i>so</i> the company of priests murder in the way by consent: for they commit lewdness.</p> 				   				
 <p><a name="xiii.xi-p3"></a><b>9. </b>Et sicut expectant latrones hominum, societas sacerdotum (<i>vel</i>, factio;) in via trucidant consensu, quia cogitationem (<i>aut</i>, scelus) perficiunt.</p> 				  			   		    		  
 <p><a name="xiii.xi-p4"></a> </p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiii.xi-p5"></a><a name="xiii.xi-p5.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.xi-p6"></a>The Prophet pursues more at large what he had briefly touched; for he does, not now confine himself to the common people, but directs his accusation against the sacerdotal order. “See,” he says, “the priests conspire among themselves like robbers, that they may slay wretched men, who may meet them in the way.” It is indeed certain that the Prophet speaks not here of open murders; for it is not credible that the priests had 			 proceeded into so great a licentiousness, that Gilead had become a slaughter-house. But the Prophets, we know, are thus wont to speak, whenever they upbraid men with being sanguinary and cruel; they compare them to robbers, and that justly. Hence he says, <i>The faction of the priests kill men in the way,</i> as if they were robbers conspiring together. And then he shows that the priests 			 were so void of every thing like the fear of God, that they perpetrated every kind of cruelty as if they were wholly given to robberies. This is the meaning.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.xi-p7"></a>The word <a name="xiii.xi-p7.1"></a>שכמה, <i>shicame,</i> is no doubt taken by the Prophet for “consent.” What is meant by <a name="xiii.xi-p7.2"></a>שכם, <i>shicam,</i> is properly 			 the “shoulder;” but it is metaphorically changed into the sense which I have mentioned; as it is in the <a name="xiii.xi-p7.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#000">Zephaniah 3</a><a name="xiii.xi-p7.3"></a>   			  <a name="fr_37"></a><a href="#fn_37"><font size="1">38</font></a>
  			  ‘They shall serve the Lord <a name="xiii.xi-p8.2"></a>שכם אחד, <i>shicam ached</i>, with one shoulder;’ that is, “with one consent.” So also in this place, the priests conspire together <a name="xiii.xi-p8.3"></a>שכמה, <i>shicame</i>, with consent.” For they who think that the name of a place is intended are much mistaken.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.xi-p9"></a>Now in the last clause of the verse it is made evident why the Prophet had said that the priests were like robbers, ‘because,’ he says, ‘they do the thought,’ or ‘wickedness.’ The verb to <a name="xiii.xi-p9.1"></a>זמם, <i>zamem</i> signifies “to think,” as it has been already said: hence <a name="xiii.xi-p9.2"></a>זמה, <i>zame</i> is “thought” in general; but is often taken by the Hebrews in a bad sense, for a “bad design,” or “wicked trick:” <i>They do</i> then <i>their conceived wickedness</i>  We hence learn that they were not open robbers, and publicly infamous in the sight of men, but that they were robbers before God, because the city was full of wicked devices, which were there concocted; and since they executed their schemes, it is justly said of them by the Prophet, that they imitated the licentiousness of robbers. Let us now go on —</p>  <a name="xiii.xii"></a>  		   			  				   				
 <p class="TableCaption29"><a name="xiii.xii-p1"></a><a name="xiii.xii-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#010">Hosea 6:10-11</a><a name="xiii.xii-p1.1"></a></p>

 <p><a name="xiii.xii-p6"></a> </p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiii.xii-p7"></a><a name="xiii.xii-p7.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.xii-p8"></a>Here God declares that he is the fit judge to take cognizance of the vices of Israel; and this he does, that he might cut off the handle of vain excuses, which hypocrites often adduce when they are reproved. Who indeed can at this day persuade the Papists that all their worship is a filthy abomination, a mere profanation? We see how furiously they rise up as soon as any one by a whisper dares to touch their superstitions. 			 Whence this? Because they wish their own will to stand for reason. Why? Good intention, they say, is the judge; as if this good intention were, forsooth, the queen, who ought to rule in heaven and earth, and God were now excluded from all his rights. This fury and this madness, even at this day, possess the Papists; and no wonder, for Satan dementates men, when he leads them to corrupt and degenerated forms of worship, and all hypocrites have been thus inebriated from the beginning. This then 			 is the reason why the Prophet now says in the person of God, <i>I have seen, </i>or <i>do see</i>, <i>infamy in the kingdom of Israel</i>. God does here by one word lay prostrate whatever men may set up for themselves, and shows that there remains no more 			 defense for what he declares he does not approve, however much men may value and applaud it. “What! you think this to be my worship; and in your imagination, this is most holy religion, this is the way of salvation, this is extraordinary sanctity; but I on the contrary declare, that it is profanation, that it is turpitude, that it is infamy. Go now,” he says, “pass elsewhere your fopperies, with me they are of no value.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.xii-p9"></a>We now understand the meaning of the Prophet, when he says<i>, In the house of Israel have I seen infamy:</i> and by the house of Israel the Prophet means the whole kingdom of the ten tribes. How so? “Because there is the fornication of Ephraim”; that is, there idolatry reigns, which 			 Jeroboam introduced, and which the other kings of Israel followed.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.xii-p10"></a>Thus we see that the Prophet spared neither the king, nor his counselors, nor the princes of the kingdom; and he did not spare before the priests. And this magnanimity becomes all God’s servants, so that they cast down every height that rises up against the word of the Lord; as it was said to Ezekiel,</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="xiii.xii-p11"></a>Chide mountains and reprove hills,’ (<a name="xiii.xii-p11.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#002">Ezek. 6:2</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#001">Ezek. 36:1</a><a name="xiii.xii-p11.1"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.xii-p12"></a>An example of this the Prophet sets before us, when he compares priests to robbers, and then compares royal temples to a brothel. Jeroboam had built a temple in which he thought that God would be in the best manner worshipped; but this, says the Prophet, is a brothel, this is filthy fornication.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiii.xii-p13"></a><a name="xiii.xii-p13.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.xii-p14"></a>Then he adds, <i>Judah also has set a plantation for thee</i>   That I may finish the chapter, I will briefly notice this verse. Interpreters render it thus, “Also Judah, thou hast set for thyself an 			 harvest:” but the verb, as it is evident, is in the third person; it cannot then be rendered otherwise than, ‘Also Judah has set.’ They who render it in the second person, “Thou hast set for thyself an harvest,” elicit this sense, “Thou also Judah, whom I have chosen for myself, hast set for thyself an harvest, that is, thou hast prepared a miserable harvest for thyself; for thou sowest ungodliness, whose fruit thou shalt hereafter gather:” but this is strained. Now since the word 			 <a name="xiii.xii-p14.2"></a>קציר, <i>kotsir,</i> signifies in Hebrew not only “harvest,” but also “a plant,” it may properly be so taken in this place, <i>Also Judah, while I was returning the captivity of my people, did set for himself a plant;</i> that is, he 			 propagated his own impieties. God indeed addresses here the Israelites, and complains of Judah; for the Jews, we know, were retained by the Lord, when the ten tribes separated. This defection of the ten tribes did not cause religion to fail wholly among the whole people. There remained the pure worship of God, at least as to the outward form, at Jerusalem. The Lord then complains not here of Judah without a cause. He had said before, ‘Judah shall be saved by his God;’ but now he says, ‘Judah 			 also has set for himself a plant;’ that is, “superstitions have been long and widely enough springing up among all Israel, they have spread through all the corners of the land: and now Judah also,” he says, “is planting his own shoots, for he draws the Israelites to himself;” there is therefore a new propagation, and this is done, <i>While I am returning the captivity of my people;</i> 			 that is, “while I am seeking to restore the scattering of my people.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.xii-p15"></a>In a word, God shows here that there was no part any longer whole. When one undertakes the cure of a diseased body, and when he sees at least some parts whole, he has some hope of applying a remedy; but when not even a finger remains sound, what can the physician do? So also the Lord says in this place, “There was at least some hope of Judah, for some form of my worship remained there, and the purer teaching of the law continued; but now 			 Judah propagates superstitions for Israel; observing that the whole land of Israel is full of superstitions, he takes from thence shoots and slips, and corrupts the remaining portion of the land, which has hitherto remained sacred to me.” We now perceive, as I think, the genuine meaning of the Prophet.</p>  <a name="xiii.xiii"></a>  		  
 <p class="3rdLevelAllCap12Bld27"><a name="xiii.xiii-p1"></a>Prayer</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.xiii-p2"></a>Grant, Almighty God, that as we are prone to every kind of wickedness, and are so easily led away to imitate it, when there is any excuse for going astray and any opportunity is offered, — O grant, that being strengthened by the help of thy Spirit, we may continue in purity of faith, and that what we have learnt concerning thee, that thou art a Spirit, may so profit us, that we may worship thee in spirit and with a sincere heart, and never turn aside 			 after the corruptions of the world, nor think that we can deceive thee; but may we so devote our souls and bodies to thee, that our life may in every part of it testify, that we are a pure and holy sacrifice to thee in Christ Jesus our Lord. Amen.</p>
