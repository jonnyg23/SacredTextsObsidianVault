 <p><a name="viii.iii-p2"></a><b>6.</b> And when they, were gathered together, they asked him, saying, Lord, dost thou at this time restore the kingdom unto Israel? <b>7.</b> And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times and the seasons, which the Father hath placed in his own ­power. <b>8.</b> But you shall receive power when as the Spirit shall come up. on you: and you shall be witnesses unto me, as well at Jerusalem as in all Judea, and in Samaria, and 				  unto the farthest part of the earth.</p>

 <p><a name="viii.iii-p5"></a><b>6.</b> He showeth that the apostles were gathered together when as this question was moved, that we may know that it came not of the foolishness of one or two that it was moved, but it was moved by the common consent of them all; but marvelous is their rudeness, that when as they had been diligently instructed by the space of three whole years, they betray no less ignorance than if they had heard never a word. There are as many errors in 			 this question as words. They ask him as concerning a kingdom; but they dream of an earthly kingdom, which should flow with riches, with dainties, with external peace, and with such like good things; and while they assign the present time to the restoring of the same. they desire to triumph before the battle; for before such time as they begin to work they will have their wages. They are also greatly deceived herein, in that they restrain Christ’s kingdom unto the carnal Israel, which was to be 			 spread abroad, even unto the uttermost parts of the world. Furthermore, there is this fault in all their whole question, namely, that they desire to know those things which are not meet for them to know. No doubt they were not ignorant what the prophets did prophesy concerning the restoring of David’s kingdom, they had oftentimes heard their Master preach concerning this matter. Lastly, It was a saying common in every man’s mouth, that, in the most miserable captivity of the people, they should 			 all be comforted, with the expectation of the kingdom that should be. Now, they hoped for the restoring hereof at the coming of the Messias, and hereupon was it that so soon as the apostles saw their Master Christ risen from the dead, they straightway began to think thereupon; but, in the meantime, they declared thereby how bad scholars they were under so good a Master. Therefore doth Christ briefly comprehend  			  <a name="fr_23"></a><a href="#fn_23"><font size="1">24</font></a>
  			 in this short answer all the errors whereinto they fell in this their question, as I shall straightway declare. To restore, in this place, doth signify to set up again that which was fallen, and through many ruins grown out of fashion; for out of the dry stock of Isai [Jesse] should spring a Branch, and the tabernacle of David, which was laid waste,  			  <a name="fr_24"></a><a href="#fn_24"><font size="1">25</font></a>
  			 should be erected and set on foot again.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="viii.iii-p8"></a><a name="viii.iii-p8.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="viii.iii-p9"></a><b>7.</b><i> It is not for you to know, etc.</i> This is a general reprehension of the whole question. For it was too curious for them to desire to know that whereof their Master would have them ignorant; but this is the true means to become wise, namely, to go as far forward in learning as our Master Christ goeth in 			 teaching, anal willingly to be ignorant of those things which he doth conceal from us. But forasmuch as there is naturally engendered in us a certain foolish and vain curiosity, and also a certain rash kind of boldness, we must diligently observe this admonition of Christ, whereby he correcteth both these vices. But to the end we may know what his meaning is hereby, we must mark the two members which he joineth together. “It is not for you” (saith he) “to know those things which the Father hath 			 placed in his own power.” He speaketh, indeed, of the times and seasons; but seeing there is the like reason in other things, we must think this to be a universal precept, That being contented with the revelation of God, we think it an heinous crime to inquire any further. This is the true mean between the two extremes. The Papists, that they may have somewhat wherewith to cloak their gross ignorance, say for themselves, that they omit the hidden mysteries of God, as though our whole faith and 			 religion did consist upon any thing else than upon the hidden mysteries of God; then may we take our leave of Christ and his gospel, if we must abstain utterly from the hidden mysteries of God. But we must keep, as I said before a mean herein; for we must be desirous to learn so far as our heavenly Master doth teach us; but as for such things as he will have us ignorant of, let mine be so bold as to inquire after them that we may be wise with sobriety. Therefore, so often as we are vexed with 			 this foolish desire of knowing more than we ought, let us call to mind this saying of Christ, “It is not for you to know.” For unless we will burst in against his will and commandment, this shall have force and strength enough to restrain the outrageousness of our wits.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="viii.iii-p10"></a>Now, as touching the foreknowledge of times, Christ condemneth only the searching out thereof which reacheth beyond the measure of God’s revelation; and that is to be noted out of the second member, as before I have said, “which the Father hath placed in his own power.” Truth it is, that God hath in his own power winter and summer, and the rest of the seasons of the year, cold and heat, fair weather and foul. But because he hath testified 			 that the course of the years shall be perpetual, (<a name="viii.iii-p10.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#014">Ge 1:14</a><a name="viii.iii-p10.1"></a>,) he is said not to have placed that in his own power which he hath revealed unto men. What thing soever the philosophers or husbandmen do comprehend or understand by art, by learning, by judgment, or experience, all that doth God not retain unto himself, because he hath after a certain sort revealed it unto them, (<a name="viii.iii-p10.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#022">Ge 8:22</a><a name="viii.iii-p10.2"></a>.) The same opinion must we have of the prophets; for it was their office to know those things which God did reveal. But we must be ignorant of the secret events of things, as touching the time to come; for there is nothing which may make us more slack in doing our duties, than too careful an inquisition herein, for we will always take counsel according to the future event of things; but the Lord, by hiding the same from us, 			 doth prescribe unto us what we ought to do. Here ariseth a conflict, because we will not willingly suffer God to have that which is his own, namely, the sole government and direction of things which are to come; but we cast ourselves into a strange and inordinate carefulness. To conclude, Christ forbiddeth us to apply those things unto ourselves, which God doth challenge as proper to himself alone. Of this sort is the foreknowledge of those things which God hath taken to himself to govern and 			 direct, according to his own pleasure, far contrary to our opinion, and otherwise than we could invent.  			  <a name="fr_25"></a><a href="#fn_25"><font size="1">26</font></a>

 <p class="Normal"><a name="viii.iii-p12"></a><a name="viii.iii-p12.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="viii.iii-p13"></a><b>8.</b> <i>You shall receive power. </i>Our Savior Christ doth here call them back as well unto the promise of God as also unto his commandment, which was the readiest way to bridle their curiosity. Curiosity doth rise almost always either of idleness or else of distrust; distrust is cured by meditating upon the 			 promises of God. And his commandments do tell us how we ought to occupy ourselves and employ our studies. Therefore, he commandeth his disciples to wait for the promise of God, and to be diligent in executing their office whereunto God had called them. And in the mean season he noteth   			  <a name="fr_26"></a><a href="#fn_26"><font size="1">27</font></a>
  			  their great hastiness, in that they did preposterously catch at those gifts which were proper unto the Holy Spirit, when as they were not as yet endued with the same. Neither did they take the right way herein, in that being called to go on warfare, they desire (omitting their labor) to lake their ease in their inn.   			  <a name="fr_27"></a><a href="#fn_27"><font size="1">28</font></a>
  			  Therefore, when he saith, <i>you shall receive power, </i>he admonisheth them of their imbecility, lest they follow before the time those things whereunto they cannot attain. It may be read very well either way, You shall receive the power of the Spirit; or, The Spirit coming upon you; yet the latter way seemeth to be the better, because it doth more fully 			 declare their defect trod want, until such time as the Spirit should come upon them.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="viii.iii-p16"></a><i>You shall be my witnesses</i> He correcteth two errors of theirs in this one sentence. For, first, he showeth that they must fight before they can triumph; and, secondly, that the nature of Christ’s kingdom was of another sort than they judged it to have been. Therefore, saith he, <i>You shall be my witnesses;</i> that is, the husbandman must first work before he can reap his fruits. Hence, nay we learn that we must first study how we may come unto the kingdom of God, before we begin to dispute   			  <a name="fr_28"></a><a href="#fn_28"><font size="1">29</font></a>
  			  about the state of the life to come. Many there be which do curiously inquire what manner [of] blessedness that shall be which they shall enjoy after they shall be received into the everlasting kingdom of heaven, not having any care how they may come to enjoy the same.   			  <a name="fr_29"></a><a href="#fn_29"><font size="1">30</font></a>
  			  They reason concerning the quality of the life to come, which they shall have with Christ; but they never think that they must be partakers of his death, that they may live together with him, (<a name="viii.iii-p18.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#011">2Ti 2:11</a><a name="viii.iii-p18.2"></a>.) Let every man, therefore, apply himself in his work which he hath in hand; let us fight stoutly under Christ’s banner; let us go forward manfully 			 and courageously   			  <a name="fr_30"></a><a href="#fn_30"><font size="1">31</font></a>
  			  in our vocation, and God will give fruit in due time (and tide.) There followeth another correction, when he saith, that they must be his <i>witnesses. </i>For hereby he meant to drive out of his disciples’ minds that fond and false imagination which they had conceived of the terrestrial kingdom, because he showeth unto them briefly, that his kingdom consisteth in the preaching of the gospel. There was no cause, therefore, 			 why they should dream of riches,   			  <a name="fr_31"></a><a href="#fn_31"><font size="1">32</font></a>
  			  of external principality, or any other earthly thing, whilst they heard that Christ did then reign when as he subdueth unto himself (all the whole) world by the preaching of the gospel. Whereupon it followeth that he doth reign spiritually, and not after any worldly manner. And that which the apostles had conceived of the carnal kingdom proceeded from the common error of their nation; neither was it marvel if they were deceived herein. 			   			  <a name="fr_32"></a><a href="#fn_32"><font size="1">33</font></a>
  			  For when we measure the same with our understanding, what else can we conceive but that which is gross and terrestrial? Hereupon it cometh, that, like brute beasts, we only desire that which is commodious for our flesh, and therefore we rather catch that which is present. Wherefore, we see that those which held opinion, that Christ should reign as a king in this world a thousand years   			  <a name="fr_33"></a><a href="#fn_33"><font size="1">34</font></a>
  			  fell into the like folly. Hereupon, also, they applied all such prophecies as did describe the kingdom of Christ figuratively by the similitude of earthly kingdoms unto the commodity of their flesh; whereas, notwithstanding, it was God’s purpose to lift up their minds higher. As for us, let us learn to apply our minds to hear the gospel preached, lest we be entangled in like errors, which prepareth a place in our hearts for the kingdom of Christ.   			  <a name="fr_34"></a><a href="#fn_34"><font size="1">35</font></a>
 </p>  		  
 <p><a name="viii.iii-p24"></a><i>In all Judea</i> Here he showeth, first, that they must not work for the space of one day only, while that he assigneth the whole world unto them, in which they must publish the doctrine of the gospel. Furthermore, he refuteth   			  <a name="fr_35"></a><a href="#fn_35"><font size="1">36</font></a>
  			  the opinion which they had conceived of Israel. They supposed those to be Israelites only which were of the seed of Abraham according to the flesh. Christ testifieth that they must gather thereunto all Samaria; which, although they were nigh in situation, yet were they far distant in mind and heart. He showeth that all other regions far distant, and also profane, must be united unto the holy people, that they may be all partakers of one and the same grace. It is 			 evident (<a name="viii.iii-p25.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#009">Joh 4:9</a><a name="viii.iii-p25.2"></a>) how greatly the Jews did detest the Samaritans. Christ commanded that (the wall of separation being broken down) they be both made one body, (<a name="viii.iii-p25.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014">Eph 2:14</a><a name="viii.iii-p25.3"></a>,) that his kingdom may be erected everywhere. By naming Judea and Jerusalem, which the apostles had 			 tried   			  <a name="fr_36"></a><a href="#fn_36"><font size="1">37</font></a>
  			  to be full of most deadly enemies, he foretelleth them of the great business and trouble which was prepared for them, that he may cause them to cease to think upon this triumph which they hoped to have been so nigh at hand.   			  <a name="fr_37"></a><a href="#fn_37"><font size="1">38</font></a>
  			  Neither could they be a little afraid to come before so cruel enemies, more to inflame their rage and fury. And here we see how he giveth the former place unto the Jews, because they are, as it were, the first-begotten, (<a name="viii.iii-p27.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#022">Ex 4:22</a><a name="viii.iii-p27.2"></a>.) Notwithstanding, he calleth those Gentiles one with another, which were before strangers from the hope of salvation, 			 (<a name="viii.iii-p27.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#011">Eph 2:11</a><a name="viii.iii-p27.3"></a>.) Hereby we learn, that the gospel was preached everywhere by the manifest commandment of Christ, that it might also come unto us.</p>
