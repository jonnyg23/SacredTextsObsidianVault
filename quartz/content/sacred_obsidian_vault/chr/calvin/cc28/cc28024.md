 <p><a name="vi.ii.i-p3"></a><b>1 </b>The word of Jehovah, which came to Micah, the Morasthite, in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem:</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.i-p4"></a><b>2 </b>Hear, all ye people, Give ear, O earth, and its fullness; (<b>155</b>) And the Lord Jehovah shall be against you a witness, <i>Even</i> the Lord from the temple of his holiness:</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.i-p5"></a><b>3 </b>For, behold, Jehovah goeth forth from his place, And will descend and tread on the heights of the earth;</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.i-p6"></a><b>4 </b>And melt shall the mountains under him, And rent shall be the valleys; As wax before the fire, As waters rolling into a lower place. (<b>160</b>)</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.i-p7"></a><b>5 </b>For the wickedness of Jacob is all this, And for the transgressions of the house of Israel: What is the wickedness of Jacob? Is it not Samaria? And what are the high places of Judah? Are they not <i>those of</i> Jerusalem? (<b>162</b>)</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.i-p8"></a><b>6 </b>I will therefore make Samaria A heap of the field, a plantation for vineyards; And I will roll into the valley its stones, And its foundations will I discover;</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.i-p9"></a><b>7 </b>And all her graven images shall be broken down, And all her rewards shall be burnt in the fire, And all her idols will I lay desolate; For from the reward of a harlot hath she gathered, And to the reward of a harlot shall they return.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.i-p10"></a><b>8 </b>For this will I wail and howl, I will go spoiled and naked; I will make wailing as the dragons, And mourning as the daughters of the ostrich: (<b>170</b>)</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.i-p11"></a><b>9 </b>For grievous is her stroke, For it has come to Judah, It has reached the gate of my people—even Jerusalem.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.i-p12"></a><b>10 </b>In Gath tell ye it not; weeping, weep not; In the house of Ophrah, roll thyself in the dust.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.i-p13"></a><b>11 </b>Pass over also, thou inhabitant of Saphir, Naked and in shame; Go forth shall not the inhabitant of Zaanan, In the mourning of Beth-ezel; She will take from you her station. (<b>176</b>)</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.i-p14"></a><b>12 </b>Verily, grieved for good has the inhabitant of Maroth; For come down has evil from Jehovah To the gate of Jerusalem.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.i-p15"></a><b>13 </b>Tie the chariot to the dromedary, Thou inhabitant of Lachish; The beginning of sin has she been to the daughter of Zion; For in thee have been found the transgressions of Israel.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.i-p16"></a><b>14 </b>Thou shalt therefore send presents, For Moresheth-gath, to the sons of Achzib, (<b>180</b>) <i>Who have been</i> a deception to the kings of Israel.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.i-p17"></a><b>15 </b>Yet a possessor will I send to thee, inhabitant of Mareshah; Even to Adullam, the glory of Israel, shall he come.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.i-p18"></a><b>16 </b>Make bald, and poll thyself, For the children of thy delicacies; Enlarge thy baldness as the eagle, Inasmuch as they have migrated from thee.</p>  <a name="vi.ii.ii"></a>

 <p><a name="vi.ii.ii-p5"></a><b>3 </b>Therefore, thus saith Jehovah, — Behold, I am devising against this family an evil, From which ye shall not remove your necks; And ye shall not walk in your height, For an evil time will it be.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.ii-p6"></a><b>4 </b>In that day shall they take up against thee a proverb, And bewail with a lamentable lament, And say, “Wasted, we are laid waste; The portion of my people has he changed; How he takes away from me instead of restoring!

 <p><a name="vi.ii.ii-p7"></a><b>5 </b>There shall not therefore be for thee One to cast a line for lot in the assembly of Jehovah.</p>

 <p><a name="vi.ii.ii-p10"></a><b>8 </b>And they who were heretofore my people, Have risen up as an enemy against me; The robe of beauty they plunder From those who pass by securely, As those who return from war. (<b>203</b>)</p>

 <p><a name="vi.ii.ii-p13"></a><b>11 </b>If a man, walking in the spirit, and lying deceitfully, says, “I will prophesy to thee of wine and of strong drink,” He shall be the prophet of this people. (<b>208</b>)</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.ii-p14"></a><b>12 </b>Gathering, I will gather the whole of thee Jacob, Assembling, I will assemble the residue of Israel; I will set them together as the sheep of Bozrah, As a flock in the midst of its fold; They shall make a noise on account <i>of the number</i> of men.</p>

 <p><a name="vi.ii.iii-p3"></a><b>1 </b>And I said, “Hear, I pray, ye princes of Jacob; And ye rulers of the house of Israel: Is it not for you to know judgment?”</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.iii-p4"></a><b>2 </b>But they hate good and love evil; They pull off the skin from them, And the flesh from their bones:</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.iii-p5"></a><b>3 </b>Yea, they devour the flesh of my people, And their skin they strip from them, And their bones they break, And make them small as for the pot, And their flesh for the cauldron.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.iii-p6"></a><b>4 </b>They shall then cry to Jehovah, And he will not answer them, But he will hide his face from them at that time, As they have acted perversely in their doings.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.iii-p7"></a><b>5 </b>Thus saith Jehovah to the Prophets, Who deceive my people, And bite with their teeth, and cry, “Peace;” And when any one putteth not in their mouth, Against him they declare war;</p>  			 
 <p><a name="vi.ii.iii-p8"></a><b>6 </b>Night shall therefore be to you instead of a vision, And darkness shall be to you instead of divination;’ And set shall the sun on the Prophets, And darkened over them shall be the day: (<b>227</b>)</p>
