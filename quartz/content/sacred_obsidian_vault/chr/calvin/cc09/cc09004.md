 <p class="BOOK-CHAP-BLU-24-CEN13"><a name="v-p1"></a>PSALM 39</p>  		
 <p><a name="v-p2"></a>In the beginning of the psalm, David intimates that his heart had been seized with extreme bitterness of grief, which forced him to give utterance to complaints with too much vehemence and ardor. He confesses that whilst he was disposed to be silent, and to exercise patience, he was nevertheless compelled, by the vehemence of his sorrow, to break out into an excess which he by no means intended. Then he relates the complaints which he had made 		  mingled with prayers, which indicate great trouble of mind; so that from this it appears that he had wrestled with no ordinary effort in resisting temptation, lest he should fall into despair.</p>  		
 <p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent15"><a name="v-p3"></a>To the chief musician, Jeduthun. A Psalm of David.</p>  		
 <p><a name="v-p4"></a>It is well known that Jeduthun was one of the chief singers of whom sacred history makes mention. (<a name="v-p4.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#016">1 Chr. 9:16</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#038">1 Chr. 16:38</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#041">41</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#042">42</a><a name="v-p4.1"></a>) It is, therefore, probable that this psalm was delivered to the chief singer, who was of his household. Some, indeed, understand it as denoting the 		  particular kind of tune, and suppose that it was the beginning of some other song; but this I consider too forced an interpretation. Nor can I agree with others who suppose that David here complains of some disease; for unless some urgent reason require it, it is improper to limit general statements to particular cases. On the contrary, from the extreme character of the sufferings which he here describes, it may be presumed that a variety of afflictions is here included, or, at least, that some 		  one is referred to which was more severe than all the others, and one which had continued for a long time. Besides, it ought to be considered that in this psalm David is not proclaiming his own merit, as if in his affliction he had presented his prayers to God in the language, and according to the spirit dictated by true piety: he rather confesses the sin of his infirmity in bursting forth into immoderate sorrow, and in being led by the vehemence of this affection to indulge in sinful 		  complaints.</p>  <a name="v.i"></a>

 <p class="Normal"><a name="v.i-p4"></a><a name="v.i-p4.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.i-p5"></a><b>1.</b> <i>I said, I will take heed to my ways.</i> David explains and illustrates the greatness of his grief by this circumstance, that, contrary to his inclination and resolution, he broke forth into the severest complaints. The meaning substantially is, that although he had subdued his heart to 			 patience, and resolved to keep silence, yet the violence of his grief was such that it forced him to break his resolution, and extorted from him, if we might so speak, expressions which indicate that he had given way to an undue degree of sorrow. The expression, <i>I said,</i> it is well known, does not always mean what is expressed in words, but is often used to denote the purpose of the 			 heart, and, therefore, the words <i>in heart </i>are sometimes added. David, therefore, means not that he boasted of his fortitude and constancy, and made a display of them before men, but that before God he was, by continued meditation, well fortified and prepared to endure patiently the temptations by which he was now assailed. We ought to mark particularly the carefulness by which he was distinguished. It was not without cause that he was so much 			 intent on exercising watchfulness over himself. He did so because he was conscious of his own weakness, and also well knew the manifold devices of Satan. He, therefore, looked on the right hand and on the left, and kept watch on all sides, lest temptation stealing upon him unawares from any quarter might reach even to his heart. Access to it, then, had been impossible, since it was shut up on every side, if the extreme severity of his grief had not overpowered him, and broken his resolution. 			 When he says, <i>I will keep my mouth with a muzzle,</i>   			  <a name="fr_60"></a><a href="#fn_60"><font size="1">61</font></a>
  			 <i> that I sin not with my tongue,</i> it is not to be understood as if he could with difficulty restrain and conceal his grief, (for it is mere pretense for a man to show by the countenance and speech the appearance of meekness when the heart still swells with pride;) but as there is nothing more slippery or loose than the tongue, David declares that he had endeavored so carefully to 			 bridle his affections, that not so much as one word should escape from his lips which might betray the least impatience. And that man must indeed be endued with singular fortitude who unfeignedly and deliberately restrains his tongue, which is so liable to fall into error. As to what follows, <i>while the wicked standeth before me,</i> it is generally understood, as if David had concealed 			 his grief, lest he should give occasion of blasphemy to the wicked, who, as soon as they see the children of God fail under the weight of their afflictions, insolently break forth into derision against them, which amounts to a contempt of God himself. But it appears to me that by the term <i>standeth, </i>David meant to express something more, — that even while he saw the wicked bearing rule, exercising authority, and exalted to honor, he resolved not 			 to speak a single word, but to bear patiently the poverty and indignity which otherwise grieve and torment not a little even good men. Accordingly, he says not merely that when he was in the presence of the wicked he restrained himself, lest he should be subjected to their scorn, but that even while the worst of men prospered,   			  <a name="fr_61"></a><a href="#fn_61"><font size="1">62</font></a>
  			  and, proud of their high rank, despised others, he was fully determined in his own mind not to be troubled at it. By this he very plainly shows that he was so beset with wicked men, ever ready for mischief, that he could not freely heave a sigh which was not made the subject of ridicule and scorn. Since, then, it was so hard a task for David to restrain his tongue, lest he should sin by giving way to complaints, let us learn from his example, whenever troubles 			 molest us, to strive earnestly to moderate our affections, that no impious expression of dissatisfaction against God may slip from us.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="v.i-p8"></a><a name="v.i-p8.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.i-p9"></a><b>2.</b> <i>I was dumb in silence.</i> He now declares that this resolution of which he has spoken had not been a mere passing and momentary thought, but that he had shown by his conduct that it was indeed a resolution deeply fixed in his heart. He says, then, that he held his peace for a time, just as if 			 he had been deaf, which was a singular manifestation of his patience. When he thus determined to be silent, it was not such a resolution as persons of a changeable disposition, who scarcely ever know their own mind, and who can with difficulty be brought to carry their desires into effect, often make: he had long and steadfastly inured himself to the exercise of patience; and this he had done, not only by keeping silence but by making himself utterly dumb, as if he had been deprived of the 			 power of speech. The expression <i>from good</i> is expounded by some in the sense that he not only refrained from uttering sinful and unadvised words, but also that he abstained from speaking on any subject whatever. Others think that he held his peace from good, either because, being overwhelmed with miseries and afflictions, he found no relief to whatever side he 			 turned, or else, because, by reason of the greatness of his sorrow, he was unable to sing the praises of God. But in my opinion the natural sense is, that although he was able adequately to defend himself, and it could not be shown that he wanted just and proper grounds of complaint, yet he refrained from speaking of his own mere will.   			  <a name="fr_62"></a><a href="#fn_62"><font size="1">63</font></a>
  			  He might have encountered the ungodly with a good defense of his own innocence, but he rather preferred to forego the prosecution of his righteous cause than indulge in any intemperate sorrow. He adds in the last clause of the verse, that although he thus restrained himself for a time, yet at length the violence of his grief broke through all the barriers which he had set to his tongue. If David, who was so valiant a champion, failed in the midst of his course, how 			 much greater reason have we to be afraid lest we fall in like manner? He says that <i>his sorrow was stirred, </i>because, as we shall soon see, the ardor of his affections was inflamed so as to become tumultuous. Some render the phrase in this sense, that <i>his sorrow was corrupted, </i>as if his meaning were, that it became worse; just as we know that a wound becomes worse when it happens to putrify or fester: but this sense is forced.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="v.i-p11"></a><a name="v.i-p11.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.i-p12"></a><b>3.</b> <i>My heart became hot within me</i> He now illustrates the greatness of his grief by the introduction of a simile, telling us that his sorrow, being internally suppressed, became so much the more inflamed, until the ardent passion of his soul continued to increase in strength. From this we may 			 learn the very profitable lesson, that the more strenuously any one sets himself to obey God, and employs all his endeavors to attain the exercise of patience, the more vigorously is he assailed by temptation: for Satan, whilst he is not so troublesome to the indifferent and careless, and seldom looks near them, displays all his forces in hostile array against that individual. If, therefore, at any time we feel ardent emotions struggling and raising a commotion in our breasts, we should call to 			 remembrance this conflict of David, that our courage may not fail us, or at least that our infirmity may not drive us headlong to despair. The dry and hot exhalations which the sun causes to arise in summer, if nothing occurred in the atmosphere to obstruct their progress, would ascend into the air without commotion; but when intervening clouds prevent their free ascent, a conflict arises, from which the thunders are produced. It is similar with respect to the godly who desire to lift up their 			 hearts to God. If they would resign themselves to the vain imaginations which arise in their minds, they might enjoy a sort of unrestrained liberty to indulge in every fancy; but because they endeavor to resist their influence, and seek to devote themselves to God, obstructions which arise from the opposition of the flesh begin to trouble them. Whenever, therefore, the flesh shall put forth its efforts, and shall kindle up a fire in our hearts, let us know that we are exercised with the same 			 kind of temptation which occasioned so much pain and trouble to David. In the end of the verse he acknowledges that the severity of the affliction with which he was visited had at length overcome him, and that he allowed foolish and unadvised words to pass from his lips. In his own person he sets before us a mirror of human infirmity, that, being warned by the danger to which we are exposed, we may learn betimes to seek protection under the shadow of God’s wings. When he says that 			 <i>he spake with his tongue,</i> it is not a superfluous mode of expression, but a true and fuller confession of his sin, in that he had not only given way to sinful murmuring, but had even uttered loud complaints.</p>  <a name="v.ii"></a>  		   			  				   				
 <p class="TableCaption16"><a name="v.ii-p1"></a><a name="v.ii-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#004">Psalm 39:4-6</a><a name="v.ii-p1.1"></a></p>

 <p class="Normal"><a name="v.ii-p6"></a><a name="v.ii-p6.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.ii-p7"></a><b>4.</b> <i>O Jehovah! cause me to know my end.</i> It appears from this, that David was transported by an improper and sinful excess of passion, seeing he finds fault with God. This will appear still more clearly from the following verses. It is true, indeed, that in what follows he introduces pious and 			 becoming prayers, but here he complains, that, being a mortal man, whose life is frail and transitory, he is not treated more mildly by God. Of this, and similar complaints, the discourses of Job are almost full. It is, therefore, not without anger and resentment that David speaks in this manner: “O God, since thou art acting with so much severity towards me, at least make me to know how long thou hast appointed me to live. But is it so, that my life is but a moment, why then dost thou act with 			 so great rigour? and why dost thou accumulate upon my head such a load of miseries, as if I had yet many ages to live? What does it profit me to have been born, if I must pass the period of my existence, which is so brief, in misery, and oppressed with a continued succession of calamities?”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.ii-p8"></a>Accordingly, this verse should be read in connection with the following one. <i>Behold, thou hast made my days as a hand-breadth.</i> A hand-breadth is the measure of four fingers, and is here taken for a very small measure; as if it had been said, the life of man flies swiftly away, and the end of it, as it were, touches 			 the beginning. Hence the Psalmist concludes that all men are only <i>vanity</i> before God. As to the meaning of the words, he does not ask that the brevity of human life should be shown to him, as if he knew it not. There is in this language a kind of irony, as if he had said, Let us count the number of the years which still remain to me on earth, and will they be a sufficient recompense 			 for the miseries which I endure? Some render the word <a name="v.ii-p8.1"></a>חדל, <i>chedel, mundane; </i>and others <i>temporal, </i>that is to say, that which endures only for a time. But the latter rendering is not appropriate in this place: for David does not as yet expressly declare the shortness of his life, but continues to 			 speak on that subject ambiguously. If the word <i>mundane </i>is adopted, the sense will be, Show me whether thou wilt prolong my life to the end of the world. But in my judgment, the translation which I have followed is much more appropriate; and, besides, there may have been a transposition of the letters <a name="v.ii-p8.3"></a>ד, <i>daleth, </i>and <a name="v.ii-p8.4"></a>ל, <i>lamed, </i>making the word <i>chedel </i>for <i>cheled. </i>It may, however, very properly be taken for an age or period of life.   			  <a name="fr_65"></a><a href="#fn_65"><font size="1">66</font></a>
  			  When he says that <i>his age is, as it were, nothing before God,</i> in order to excite God so much the more to pity and compassion, he appeals to him as a witness of his frailty, intimating, that it is not a thing unknown to him how transitory and passing the life of man is. The expression, <i>wholly</i> or <i>altogether vanity,</i>   			  <a name="fr_66"></a><a href="#fn_66"><font size="1">67</font></a>
  			  implies that among the whole human race there is nothing but vanity. He declares this of men, even whilst <i>they are standing;</i>   			  <a name="fr_67"></a><a href="#fn_67"><font size="1">68</font></a>
  			  that is to say, when, being in the prime and vigor of life, they wish to be held in estimation, and seem to themselves to be men possessed of considerable influence and power. It was the pangs of sorrow which forced David to give utterance to these complaints; but it is to be observed, that it is chiefly when men are sore oppressed by adversity that they are made to feel their nothingness in the sight of God. Prosperity so intoxicates them, that, forgetful of their 			 condition, and sunk in insensibility, they dream of an immortal state on earth. It is very profitable for us to know our own frailty, but we must beware lest, on account of it, we fall into such a state of sorrow as may lead us to murmur and repine. David speaks truly and wisely in declaring, that man, even when he seems to have risen to the highest state of greatness, is only like the bubble which rises upon the water, blown up by the wind; but he is in fault when he takes occasion from this 			 to complain of God. Let us, therefore, so feel the misery of our present condition, as that, however cast down and afflicted, we may, as humble suppliants, lift up our eyes to God, and implore his mercy. This we find David does a little after, having corrected himself; for he does not continue to indulge in rash and inconsiderate lamentations, but lifting up his soul in the exercise of faith, he attains heavenly consolation.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="v.ii-p12"></a><a name="v.ii-p12.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.ii-p13"></a><b>6.</b> <i>Surely man walketh in a shadow.</i>   			  <a name="fr_68"></a><a href="#fn_68"><font size="1">69</font></a>
  			  He still prosecutes the same subject. By the word <i>shadow, </i>he means, that there is nothing substantial in man, but that he is only, as we say, a vain show, and has I know not how much of display and ostentation.   			  <a name="fr_69"></a><a href="#fn_69"><font size="1">70</font></a>
  			  Some translate the word <i>darkness, </i>and understand the Psalmist’s language in this sense, That the life of man vanishes away before it can be known. But in these words David simply declares of every man individually what Paul extends to the whole world, when he says,</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="v.ii-p16"></a>“The fashion of this world passeth away.” — <br> 			 <a name="v.ii-p16.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#031">1Co 7:31</a><a name="v.ii-p16.2"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.ii-p17"></a>Thus he denies that there is any thing abiding in men, because the appearance of strength which displays itself in them for a time soon passes away. What he adds, that men <i>disquiet themselves in vain,</i> shows the very height of their vanity; as if he had said, It seems as if men were born for the very purpose of 			 rendering themselves more and more contemptible: for although they are only as a shadow, yet as if they were fools, or rather insane, they involve themselves needlessly in harassing cares, and vexing themselves to no purpose. He expresses still more plainly how they manifest their folly, when he declares that while they anxiously and carefully heap up riches, they never think that they must soon, and it may be suddenly, leave their present abode. And why is it that they thus fret away their 			 mind and body, but only because they imagine that they can never have enough? for by their insatiable desire of gain, they eagerly grasp at all the riches of the world, as if they had to live a hundred times the life of man. Moreover, David does not in this passage hold up to scorn the covetousness of man in the same sense in which Solomon does, <a name="v.ii-p17.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#010">Ec 5:10</a><a name="v.ii-p17.1"></a>; for he not only 			 speaks of their heirs, but declares generally, that men disquiet and vex themselves with care, although they know not who shall reap the fruit of their labor in amassing riches.   			  <a name="fr_70"></a><a href="#fn_70"><font size="1">71</font></a>
  			  They may indeed wish to make provision for themselves; but what madness and folly is it for them to torment themselves with incessant and unprofitable cares which have no certain object or limit? David here condemns those ardent and unbridled desires, under the influence of which worldly men are carried away, and talk in a strange manner, confounding heaven and earth; for they admit not that they are mortal, much less do they consider that their life is bounded by 			 the narrow limits of a hand-breadth. David spoke under the influence of a distempered and troubled state of mind; but there is included in his language this very profitable lesson, that there is no remedy better fitted for enabling us to rise above all unnecessary cares, than the recollection that the brief period of our life is only, as it were, a hand-breadth.</p>  <a name="v.iii"></a>

 <p><a name="v.iii-p7"></a><b>7.</b> <i>And now, O Lord! what do I wait for?</i> David, having acknowledged that his heart had been too much under the influence of ardent and impetuous emotion, from which he had experienced great disquietude, now returns to a calm and settled state of mind; and from this what I have before stated 			 is rendered still more obvious, namely, that this psalm consists partly of appropriate prayers and partly of inconsiderate complaints. I have said that David here begins to pray aright. It is true, that even worldly men sometimes feel in the very same way in which David here acknowledges that he felt; but the knowledge of their own vanity does not lead them so far as to seek substantial support in God. On the contrary, they rather wilfully render themselves insensible, that they may indulge 			 undisturbed in their own vanity. We may learn from this passage, that no man looks to God for the purpose of depending upon him, and resting his hope in him, until he is made to feel his own frailty, yea, and even brought to nought. There is tacitly great force in the adverb <i>now, </i>as if David had said, The flattery and vain imaginations by which the minds of men are held fast in the 			 sleep of security no longer deceive me, but I am now fully sensible of my condition. But we must go beyond this elementary stage; for it is not enough, that, being aroused by a sense of our infirmity, we should seek with fear and trembling to know our duty, unless at the same time God manifest himself to us, on whom alone all our expectation should depend. Accordingly, as it serves no end for worldly men to be convinced of their utter vanity, because, although convinced of this, they never 			 improve by it, let us learn to press forward and make still further progress, in order that, being as it were dead, we may be quickened by God, whose peculiar office it is to create all things out of nothing; for man then ceases to be vanity, and begins to be truly something, when, aided by the power of God, he aspires to heavenly things.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="v.iii-p8"></a><a name="v.iii-p8.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.iii-p9"></a><b>8.</b> <i>Deliver me from all my sins. </i>In this verse the Psalmist still continues his godly and holy prayer. He is now no longer carried away by the violence of his grief to murmur against God, but, humbly acknowledging himself guilty before God, he has recourse to his mercy. In asking to be delivered from his 			 transgressions, he ascribes the praise of righteousness to God, while he charges upon himself the blame of all the misery which he endures; and he blames himself, not only on account of one sin, but acknowledges that he is justly chargeable with manifold transgressions. By this rule we must be guided, if we would wish to obtain an alleviation of our miseries; for, until the very source of them has been dried up, they will never cease to follow one another in rapid succession. David 			 unquestionably wished an alleviation of his miseries, but, as he expected that, as soon as he should be reconciled to God, the chastisement of his sins would also cease, he only here asks that his sins may be forgiven him. We are thus taught by the example of David, not merely to seek deliverance from the miseries which afflict and trouble us, but to trace them to their cause and source, entreating God that he would not lay our sins to our charge, but blot out our guilt. What follows concerning 			 the <i>reproach</i> or <i>scorn of the foolish</i> may be understood in an active as well as a passive signification, denoting, either that God would not abandon him to the mockery of the wicked, or that he would not involve him in the same disgrace to which the ungodly are given 			 over. As, however, either of these senses will agree very well with the design of the Psalmist, I leave it to the reader to adopt the one which he prefers. Besides, the word <a name="v.iii-p9.1"></a>נבל<i>, nabal, </i>signifies not only a foolish person, but also a contemptible man, one who is utterly worthless and base. It is at least certain, that by this word the reprobate, whom the Scriptures 			 condemn for their folly, are intended; because, being deprived of their reason and understanding, they break forth into every excess in contemning and reproaching God.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="v.iii-p10"></a><a name="v.iii-p10.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.iii-p11"></a><b>9.</b> <i>I was dumb</i> Here David blames himself, because he had not preserved that silence which, as we have already seen, the violence of his grief forced him to break. When he says then that he was <i>dumb, 			 </i>he does not mean this as a commendation of the uniform and persevering restraint which he had exercised over himself. It is rather a correction of his error, as if reproving his own impatience, he had spoken within himself in this way: What doest thou? thou hadst enjoined upon thyself silence, and now thou murmurest proudly against God; what wilt thou gain by this presumption? We have here a very profitable and instructive lesson; for nothing is better fitted to 			 restrain the violent paroxysms of grief, than the recollection that we have to do, not with a mortal man, but with God, who will always maintain his own righteousness in opposition to all that men may say against it in their murmuring complaints, and even in their outrageous accusations. What is the reason why the great majority of men run to such excess in their impatience, but because they forget that, in doing so, they dare to plead a controversy with God? Thus, while some impute all their 			 miseries to fortune, and others to men, and others account for them from a variety of causes which their own fancy suggests, while scarcely one in a hundred recognises in them the hand of God, they allow themselves to indulge in bitter complaint, without ever thinking that in so doing they offend God. David, on the contrary, in order to subdue every unholy desire and sinful excess, returns to God, and resolves to keep silence, because the affliction which he is now suffering proceeded from God. 			 As David, who was thus afflicted with the severest trials, resolved nevertheless to keep silence, let us learn from this, that it is one of the chief exercises of our faith to humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God, and to submit to his judgments without murmuring or complaint. It is to be observed, that men humbly and calmly submit themselves to God only when they are persuaded, not only that he does by his almighty power whatever he pleases, but that he is also a righteous Judge; for 			 although the wicked feel that the hand of God is upon them, yet as they charge him with cruelty and tyranny, they cease not to pour forth horrible blasphemies against him. In the meantime, David regards the secret judgments of God with such reverence and wonder, that, satisfied with his will alone, he considers it sinful to open his mouth to utter a single word against him.</p>  <a name="v.iv"></a>

 <p><a name="v.iv-p5"></a><b>10</b>  <i>Take away thy stroke from me.</i> David here confirms the prayer which he had already presented, namely, that having obtained pardon from God, he might, at the same time, be gently dealt with by him. This prayer, however, does not disturb the silence of which he had 			 just made mention; for our desires and prayers, if they are framed according to the rule of God’s word, are not inconsiderate and noisy so as to provoke the divine displeasure against us, but proceed from the calm stillness which faith and patience produce in our hearts. It is indeed true, that when any one prays earnestly to God, he cannot fail to mix up with it his own feelings, pour forth his complaints, and manifest an extreme ardor. But we see that David, who formerly bewailed his miseries 			 in loud lamentations, now sets himself calmly to consider and weigh what he merited, and prays for pardon. His meaning is, that God would mitigate the punishment which he had inflicted upon him. The reason immediately follows; for <i>I have fainted by the blow of thy hand.</i> In thus speaking, David does not allege this as an excuse to extenuate his fault, but desires that he may be borne 			 with in his infirmity. As he says with respect to himself individually, that he is consumed, because he feels that the hand of God is against him, so he immediately states in the 11th verse the same truth in general terms, telling us, that if God should begin to deal with us according to the strict demands of the law, the consequence would be, that all would perish, and be utterly overwhelmed under his wrath. He plainly shows, first, that he is speaking not of any one man, or even of men 			 generally, for he makes use of a Hebrew word, which denotes a man renowned for his valor, courage, or excellence;   			  <a name="fr_73"></a><a href="#fn_73"><font size="1">74</font></a>
  			  and then, secondly, he says, that if God should set himself to chastise such persons, every thing which they esteem precious in themselves would consume away or be dissolved. The sum is, that among men there is no one endued with such power and glory whom the wrath of God, if it burn fiercely against him, will not forthwith bring to nothing. But it will be necessary to examine the words more minutely. David does not simply describe the dreadful character of God’s 			 wrath; but at the same time he declares and sets forth his righteousness in all the punishments which he inflicts upon men. The judgments of God sometimes strike fear and dread into the hearts even of heathen men, but their blindness fills them with such rage, that they still continue to fight against God. By the term <i>rebukes, </i>David means severe punishments, such as are the tokens of 			 strict justice and signs of divine wrath. We know that God often exercises the rod of his chastisement upon true believers, but he does it in such a manner as that in punishing them he at the same time gives them a taste of his mercy and his love, and not only tempers the chastisements with which he visits them, but also mingles them with comfort, which serves to render them much more tolerable. David, then, is not speaking in this place of fatherly chastisement, but of the punishment which God 			 inflicts upon the reprobate, when, like an inexorable judge in the exercise of his office, he executes against them the judgment which they have merited. He tells us that when God makes this rigour to be felt, there is no man who does not forthwith consume or pine away. At first view the comparison of God to a moth may seem absurd; for what relation is there, it may be said, between a small moth-worm and the infinite majesty of God? I answer, That David has with much propriety made use of this 			 simile, that we may know that although God does not openly thunder from heaven against the reprobate, yet his secret curse ceases not to consume them away, just as the moth, though unperceived, wastes by its secret gnawing a piece of cloth or wood.   			  <a name="fr_74"></a><a href="#fn_74"><font size="1">75</font></a>
  			  At the same time, he alludes to <i>the excellency</i>   			  <a name="fr_75"></a><a href="#fn_75"><font size="1">76</font></a>
  			  of man, which he says is destroyed as it were by corruption, when God is offended, even as the moth destroys the most precious cloths by wasting them. The Scriptures often very appropriately employ various similitudes in this Way, and are wont to apply them sometimes in one view and sometimes in another. When Hezekiah (<a name="v.iv-p10.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#013">Isa 38:13</a><a name="v.iv-p10.1"></a>) 			 compares God to a lion, he does so in reference to the feelings of his own mind, because he was so prostrated and overwhelmed with fear and terror. But in this place David teaches us, that although the world may not perceive the dreadful vengeance of God, yet it consumes the reprobate by secretly gnawing them. This sentence, <i>that every man is vanity, </i>is again very properly repeated; 			 for until we are overcome by the power of God, and as it were humbled in the dust, we never search into our own hearts, that the knowledge of our own vanity may divest us of all presumption. Whence is it that men are so foolishly satisfied with themselves, yea, and even applaud themselves, unless it be that, so long as God bears with them, they are wilfully blind to their own infirmities? The only remedy, then, by which men are cured of pride is when, alarmed with a sense of God’s wrath, they 			 begin not only to be dissatisfied with themselves, but also to humble themselves even to the dust.</p>  <a name="v.v"></a>

 <p><a name="v.v-p6"></a><b>12</b> <i>Hear my prayer, O Jehovah!</i> David gradually increases his vehemence in prayer. He speaks first of <i>prayer; </i>in the second place, of <i>crying; </i>and in the third place, of <i>tears</i> This gradation is not a mere figure of rhetoric, which serves only to adorn the style, or to express the same thing in different language. This shows that David bewailed his condition sincerely, and from the bottom of his heart; and in this he has given us, by his own 			 example, a rule for prayer. When he calls himself a <i>stranger</i> and a <i>sojourner, </i>he again shows how miserable his condition was; and he adds expressly, <i>before God, </i>not only because men are absent from God so long as they dwell in this world, but in the same sense in which he formerly said, <i>My days are before thee as nothing;</i> that is to say, God, without standing in need of any one to inform him, knows well enough that men have only a short journey to perform in this world, the end of which is soon reached, or that they remain only a 			 short time in it, as those who are lodged in a house for pay.   			  <a name="fr_77"></a><a href="#fn_77"><font size="1">78</font></a>
  			  The purport of the Psalmist’s discourse is, that God sees from heaven how miserable our condition would be, if he did not sustain us by his mercy.</p>

 <p><a name="v.v-p9"></a><b>13</b>  <i>Let me alone, that I may recover strength.</i> Literally, it is, <i>cease from me,</i> and therefore some explain it, Let there be a wall raised betwixt us, that thy 			 hand may not reach me. Others read, as a supplement, the word <i>eyes; </i>but as to the sense, it matters little which of the expositions be adopted, for the meaning is the same, That David entreats God to grant him a little relaxation from his trouble, that he might recover strength, or, at least, enjoy a short respite, before he depart from this world. This concluding verse of the psalm relates to the disquietude and sinful emotions which he had 			 experienced according to the flesh; for he seems in the way of complaining of God, to ask that at least time might be granted him to die, as men are wont to speak who are grievously harassed by their affliction. I admit, that he speaks in a becoming manner, in acknowledging that there is no hope of his being restored to health, until God cease to manifest his displeasure; but he errs in this, that he asks a respite, just that he may have time to die. We might, indeed, regard the prayer as 			 allowable, by understanding it in this sense: <i>Lord, </i>as it will not be possible for me to endure thy stroke any longer, but I must, indeed, miserably perish, if thou continuest to afflict me severely, at least grant me relief for a little season, that in calmness and peace I may commit my soul into thy hands. But we may easily infer, from the language which he employs, that his mind 			 was so affected with the bitterness of his grief that he could not present a prayer pure and well seasoned with the sweetness of faith; for he says, <i>before I depart, and be no more:</i> a form of speech which indicates the feeling almost of despair. Not that David could regard death as the entire annihilation of man, or that, renouncing all hope of his salvation, he resigned himself to 			 destruction; but he employs this language, because he had previously been so much depressed by reason of grief, that he could not lift up his heart with so much cheerfulness as it behoved him. This is a mode of expression which is to be found more than once in the complaints of Job. It is obvious, therefore, that, although David endeavored carefully to restrain the desires of the flesh, yet these occasioned him so much disquietude and trouble, that they forced him to exceed the proper limits in 			 his grief.</p>
