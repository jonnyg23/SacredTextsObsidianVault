 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Of Prayer</i>, by John Calvin, tr. Henry  Beveridge [1845], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <a name="iii.xlvi"></a> <h4 align="center"><a name="iii.xlvi-p0.1"></a>46. </h4> 
 <p><a name="iii.xlvi-p1"></a>The sixth petition corresponds (as we have observed) to the  promise <a name="fr_25"></a><a href="#fn_25"><font size="1">26</font></a>
   of <i>writing the law upon our hearts;</i> but because we do not obey God  without a continual warfare, without sharp and arduous contests, we here pray  that he would furnish us with armour, and defend us by his protection, that we  may be able to obtain the victory. By this we are reminded that we not only have  need of the gift of the Spirit inwardly to soften our hearts, and turn and  direct them to the obedience of God, but also of his assistance, to render us  invincible by all the wiles and violent assaults of Satan. The forms of  temptation are many and various. The depraved conceptions of our minds provoking  us to transgress the law — conceptions which our concupiscence suggests or the  devil excites, are temptations; and things which in their own nature are not  evil, become temptations by the wiles of the devil, when they are presented to  our eyes in such a way that the view of them makes us withdraw or decline from  God. <a name="fr_26"></a><a href="#fn_26"><font size="1">27</font></a>
   These temptations are both on the right hand and on the left. <a name="fr_27"></a><a href="#fn_27"><font size="1">28</font></a>
  On the  right, when riches, power, and honours, which by their glare, and the semblance  of good which they present, generally dazzle the eyes of men, and so entice by  their blandishments, that, caught by their snares, and intoxicated by their  sweetness, they forget their God: on the left, when offended by the hardship and  bitterness of poverty, disgrace, contempt, afflictions, and other things of that  description, they despond, cast away their confidence and hope, and are at  length totally estranged from God. In regard to both kinds of temptation, which  either enkindled in us by concupiscence, or presented by the craft of Satan's  war against us, we pray God the Father not to allow us to be overcome, but  rather to raise and support us by his hand, that strengthened by his mighty  power we may stand firm against all the assaults of our malignant enemy,  whatever be the thoughts which he sends into our minds; next we pray that  whatever of either description is allotted us, we may turn to good, that is, may  neither be inflated with prosperity, nor cast down by adversity. Here, however,  we do not ask to be altogether exempted from temptation, which is very necessary  to excite, stimulate, and urge us on, that we may not become too lethargic. It  was not without reason that David wished to be tried, <a name="fr_28"></a><a href="#fn_28"><font size="1">29</font></a>
   nor is it  without cause that the Lord daily tries his elect, chastising them by disgrace,  poverty, tribulation, and other kinds of cross. <a name="fr_29"></a><a href="#fn_29"><font size="1">30</font></a>
  But the  temptations of God and Satan are very different: Satan tempts, that he may  destroy, condemn, confound, throw headlong; God, that by proving his people he  may make trial of their sincerity, and by exercising their strength confirm it;  may mortify, tame, and cauterize their flesh, which, if not curbed in this  manner, would wanton and exult above measure. Besides, Satan attacks those who  are unarmed and unprepared, that he may destroy them unawares; whereas whatever  God sends, he "will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may  be able to bear it." <a name="fr_30"></a><a href="#fn_30"><font size="1">31</font></a>
   Whether by the term evil we understand the devil or sin, is not of the least  consequence. Satan is indeed the very enemy who lays snares for our life, <a name="fr_31"></a><a href="#fn_31"><font size="1">32</font></a>
  but it is  by sin that he is armed for our destruction.</p> 
 <p class="noindent"><a name="iii.xlvi-p2"></a>Our petition, therefore, is, that we may not be overcome or overwhelmed with  temptation, but in the strength of the Lord may stand firm against all the  powers by which we are assailed; in other words, may not fall under temptation:  that being thus taken under his charge and protection, we may remain invincible  by sin, death, the gates of hell, and the whole power of the devil; in other  words, be delivered from evil. Here it is carefully to be observed, that we have  no strength to contend with such a combatant as the devil, or to sustain the  violence of his assault. Were it otherwise, it would be mockery of God to ask of  him what we already possess in ourselves. Assuredly those who in self-confidence  prepare for such a fight, do not understand how bold and well-equipped the enemy  is with whom they have to do. Now we ask to be delivered from his power, as from  the mouth of some furious raging lion, who would instantly tear us with his  teeth and claws, and swallow us up, did not the Lord rescue us from the midst of  death; at the same time knowing that if the Lord is present and will fight for  us while we stand by, through him "we shall do valiantly" (<a name="iii.xlvi-p2.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#012">Psalm 60:12</a><a name="iii.xlvi-p2.1"></a>). Let  others if they will confide in the powers and resources of their free will which  they think they possess; enough for us that we stand and are strong in the power  of God alone. But the prayer comprehends more than at first sight it seems to  do. For if the Spirit of God is our strength in waging the contest with Satan,  we cannot gain the victory unless we are filled with him, and thereby freed from  all infirmity of the flesh. Therefore, when we pray to be delivered from sin and  Satan, we at the same time desire to be enriched with new supplies of divine  grace, until completely replenished with them, we triumph over every evil. To  some it seems rude and harsh to ask God not to lead us into temptation, since,  as James declares (<a name="iii.xlvi-p2.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#013">James 1:13</a><a name="iii.xlvi-p2.2"></a>), it is contrary to his nature to do so. This  difficulty has already been partly solved by the fact that our concupiscence is  the cause, and therefore properly bears the blame of all the temptations by  which we are overcome. All that James means is, that it is vain and unjust to  ascribe to God vices which our own consciousness compels us to impute to  ourselves. But this is no reason why God may not when he sees it meet bring us  into bondage to Satan, give us up to a reprobate mind and shameful lusts, and so  by a just, indeed, but often hidden judgment, lead us into temptation. Though  the cause is often concealed from men, it is well known to him. Hence we may see  that the expression is not improper, if we are persuaded that it is not without  cause he so often threatens to give sure signs of his vengeance, by blinding the  reprobate, and hardening their hearts.</p>
