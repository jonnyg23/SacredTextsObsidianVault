 <p><a name="iii.li-p1"></a>If, with minds thus framed to obedience, we allow ourselves to be  governed by the laws of Divine Providence, we shall easily learn to persevere in  prayer, and suspending our own desires wait patiently for the Lord, certain,  however little the appearance of it may be, that he is always present with us,  and will in his own time show how very far he was from turning a deaf ear to  prayers, though to the eyes of men they may seem to be disregarded. This will be  a very present consolation, if at any time God does not grant an immediate  answer to our prayers, preventing us from fainting or giving way to despondency,  as those are wont to do who, in invoking God, are so borne away by their own  fervour, that unless he yield on their first importunity and give present help,  they immediately imagine that he is angry and offended with them and abandoning  all hope of success cease from prayer. On the contrary, deferring our hope with  well tempered equanimity, let us insist with that perseverance which is so  strongly recommended to us in Scripture. We may often see in The Psalms how  David and other believers, after they are almost weary of praying, and seem to  have been beating the air by addressing a God who would not hear, yet cease not  to pray because due authority is not given to the word of God, unless the faith  placed in it is superior to all events. Again, let us not tempt God, and by  wearying him with our importunity provoke his anger against us. Many have a  practice of formally bargaining with God on certain conditions, and, as if he  were the servant of their lust, binding him to certain stipulations; with which  if he do not immediately comply, they are indignant and fretful, murmur,  complain, and make a noise. Thus offended, he often in his anger grants to such  persons what in mercy he kindly denies to others. Of this we have a proof in the  children of Israel, for whom it had been better not to have been heard by the  Lord, than to swallow his indignation with their flesh (<a name="iii.li-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#018">Num. 11:18</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#033">33</a><a name="iii.li-p1.1"></a>).</p>
