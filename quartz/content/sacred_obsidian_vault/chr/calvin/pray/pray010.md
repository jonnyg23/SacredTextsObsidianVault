 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Of Prayer</i>, by John Calvin, tr. Henry  Beveridge [1845], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <a name="iii.viii"></a>  <h4 align="center"><a name="iii.viii-p0.1"></a>8. </h4> 
 <p><a name="iii.viii-p1"></a>The third rule to be added is: that he who comes into the presence  of God to pray must divest himself of all vainglorious thoughts, lay aside all  idea of worth; in short, discard all self-confidence, humbly giving God the  whole glory, lest by arrogating anything, however little, to himself, vain pride  cause him to turn away his face. Of this submission, which casts down all  haughtiness, we have numerous examples in the servants of God. The holier they  are, the more humbly they prostrate themselves when they come into the presence  of the Lord. Thus Daniel, on whom the Lord himself bestowed such high  commendation, says, "We do not present our supplications before thee for our  righteousness but for thy great mercies. O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord,  hearken and do; defer not, for thine own sake, O my God: for thy city and thy  people are called by thy name." This he does not indirectly in the usual manner,  as if he were one of the individuals in a crowd: he rather confesses his guilt  apart, and as a suppliant betaking himself to the asylum of pardon, he  distinctly declares that he was confessing his own sin, and the sin of his  people Israel (<a name="iii.viii-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#018">Daniel 9:18-20</a><a name="iii.viii-p1.1"></a>). David also sets us an example of this humility:  " Enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man living  be justified" (<a name="iii.viii-p1.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#002">Psalm 143:2</a><a name="iii.viii-p1.2"></a>). In like manner, Isaiah prays, "Behold, thou art  wroth; for we have sinned: in those is continuance, and we shall be saved. But  we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags;  and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us  away. And there is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up himself to  take hold of thee: for thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast consumed us,  because of our iniquities. But now, O Lord, thou art our Father; we are the  clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand. Be not wroth  very sore, O Lord, neither remember iniquity for ever: Behold, see, we beseech  thee, we are all thy people." (<a name="iii.viii-p1.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#005">Isaiah 64:5-9</a><a name="iii.viii-p1.3"></a>). You see how they put no confidence  in anything but this: considering that they are the Lord's, they despair not of  being the objects of his care. In the same way, Jeremiah says, "O Lord, though  our iniquities testify against us, do thou it for thy name's sake" (<a name="iii.viii-p1.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#007">Jeremiah 14:7</a><a name="iii.viii-p1.4"></a>).  For it was most truly and piously written by the uncertain author (whoever he  may have been) that wrote the book which is attributed to the prophet Baruch, <a name="fr_1"></a><a href="#fn_1"><font size="1">2</font></a>
  "But the  soul that is greatly vexed, which goeth stooping and feeble, and the eyes that  fail, and the hungry soul, will give thee praise and righteousness, O Lord.  Therefore, we do not make our humble supplication before thee, O Lord our God,  for the righteousness of our fathers, and of our kings." "Hear, O Lord, and have  mercy; for thou art merciful: and have pity upon us, because we have sinned  before thee" (<a name="iii.viii-p1.7"></a><a href="../../../bib/apo/bar002.htm#018">Bar. 2:18</a>, <a href="../../../bib/apo/bar002.htm#019">19</a><a name="iii.viii-p1.7"></a>; <a name="iii.viii-p1.8"></a><a href="../../../bib/apo/bar003.htm#002">Baruch 3:2</a><a name="iii.viii-p1.8"></a>).</p>
