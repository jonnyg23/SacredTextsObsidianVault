 <p><a name="iii.ix-p1"></a>In fine, supplication for pardon, with humble and ingenuous  confession of guilt, forms both the preparation and commencement of right  prayer. For the holiest of men cannot hope to obtain anything from God until he  has been freely reconciled to him. God cannot be propitious to any but those  whom he pardons. Hence it is not strange that this is the key by which believers  open the door of prayer, as we learn from several passages in The Psalms. David,  when presenting a request on a different subject, says, "Remember not the sins  of my youth, nor my transgressions; according to thy mercy remember me, for thy  goodness sake, O Lord" (<a name="iii.ix-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#007">Psalm 25:7</a><a name="iii.ix-p1.1"></a>). Again, "Look upon my affliction and my  pain, and forgive my sins" (<a name="iii.ix-p1.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#018">Psalm 25:18</a><a name="iii.ix-p1.2"></a>). Here also we see that it is not  sufficient to call ourselves to account for the sins of each passing day; we  must also call to mind those which might seem to have been long before buried in  oblivion. For in another passage the same prophet, confessing one grievous  crime, takes occasion to go back to his very birth, "I was shapen in iniquity,  and in sin did my mother conceive me" (<a name="iii.ix-p1.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#005">Psalm 51:5</a><a name="iii.ix-p1.3"></a>); not to extenuate the fault  by the corruption of his nature, but as it were to accumulate the sins of his  whole life, that the stricter he was in condemning himself, the more placable  God might be. But although the saints do not always in express terms ask  forgiveness of sins, yet if we carefully ponder those prayers as given in  Scripture, the truth of what I say will readily appear; namely, that their  courage to pray was derived solely from the mercy of God, and that they always  began with appeasing him. For when a man interrogates his conscience, so far is  he from presuming to lay his cares familiarly before God, that if he did not  trust to mercy and pardon, he would tremble at the very thought of approaching  him. There is, indeed, another special confession. When believers long for  deliverance from punishment, they at the same time pray that their sins may be  pardoned; <a name="fr_2"></a><a href="#fn_2"><font size="1">3</font></a>
   for it were absurd to wish that the effect should be taken away while the cause  remains. For we must beware of imitating foolish patients who, anxious only  about curing accidental symptoms, neglect the root of the disease. <a name="fr_3"></a><a href="#fn_3"><font size="1">4</font></a>
  Nay, our  endeavour must be to have God propitious even before he attests his favour by  external signs, both because this is the order which he himself chooses, and it  were of little avail to experience his kindness, did not conscience feel that he  is appeased, and thus enable us to regard him as altogether lovely. Of this we  are even reminded by our Saviour's reply. Having determined to cure the  paralytic, he says, "Thy sins are forgiven thee;" in other words, he raises our  thoughts to the object which is especially to be desired, viz. admission into  the favour of God, and then gives the fruit of reconciliation by bringing  assistance to us. But besides that special confession of present guilt which  believers employ, in supplicating for pardon of every fault and punishment, that  general introduction which procures favour for our prayers must never be  omitted, because prayers will never reach God unless they are founded on free  mercy. To this we may refer the words of John, "If we confess our sins, he is  faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all  unrighteousness" (<a name="iii.ix-p1.8"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#009">1 John 1:9</a><a name="iii.ix-p1.8"></a>). Hence, under the law it was necessary to  consecrate prayers by the expiation of blood, both that they might be accepted,  and that the people might be warned that they were unworthy of the high  privilege until, being purged from their defilements, they founded their  confidence in prayer entirely on the mercy of God.</p>
