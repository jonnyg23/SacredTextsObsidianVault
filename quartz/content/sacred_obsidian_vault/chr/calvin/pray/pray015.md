 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Of Prayer</i>, by John Calvin, tr. Henry  Beveridge [1845], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <a name="iii.xiii"></a> <h4 align="center"><a name="iii.xiii-p0.1"></a>13. </h4> 
 <p><a name="iii.xiii-p1"></a>And first, indeed in enjoining us to pray, he by the very  injunction convicts us of impious contumacy if we obey not. He could not give a  more precise command than that which is contained in the psalms: "Call upon me  in the day of trouble" (<a name="iii.xiii-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#015">Psalm 50:15</a><a name="iii.xiii-p1.1"></a>). But as there is no office of piety more  frequently enjoined by Scripture, there is no occasion for here dwelling longer  upon it. "Ask," says our Divine Master, "and it shall be given you; seek, and ye  shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you" (<a name="iii.xiii-p1.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#007">Matthew 7:7</a><a name="iii.xiii-p1.2"></a>). Here, indeed,  a promise is added to the precept, and this is necessary. For though all confess  that we must obey the precept, yet the greater part would shun the invitation of  God, did he not promise that he would listen and be ready to answer. These two  positions being laid down, it is certain that all who cavillingly allege that  they are not to come to God directly, are not only rebellious and disobedient  but are also convicted of unbelief, inasmuch as they distrust the promises.  There is the more occasion to attend to this, because hypocrites, under a  pretense of humility and modesty, proudly contemn the precept, as well as deny  all credit to the gracious invitation of God; nay, rob him of a principal part  of his worship. For when he rejected sacrifices, in which all holiness seemed  then to consist, he declared that the chief thing, that which above all others  is precious in his sight, is to be invoked in the day of necessity. Therefore,  when he demands that which is his own, and urges us to alacrity in obeying, no  pretexts for doubt, how specious soever they may be, can excuse us. Hence, all  the passages throughout Scripture in which we are commanded to pray, are set up  before our eyes as so many banners, to inspire us with confidence. It were  presumption to go forward into the presence of God, did he not anticipate us by  his invitation. Accordingly, he opens up the way for us by his own voice, "I  will say, It is my people: and they shall say, The Lord is my God" (<a name="iii.xiii-p1.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#009">Zechariah 13:9</a><a name="iii.xiii-p1.3"></a>).  We see how he anticipates his worshippers, and desires them to follow, and  therefore we cannot fear that the melody which he himself dictates will prove  unpleasing. Especially let us call to mind that noble description of the divine  character, by trusting to which we shall easily overcome every obstacle: O thou  that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come" (<a name="iii.xiii-p1.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#002">Psalm 65:2</a><a name="iii.xiii-p1.4"></a>). What can be  more lovely or soothing than to see God invested with a title which assures us  that nothing is more proper to his nature than to listen to the prayers of  suppliants? Hence the Psalmist infers, that free access is given not to a few  individuals, but to all men, since God addresses all in these terms, "Call upon  me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me" (<a name="iii.xiii-p1.5"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#015">Psalm 50:15</a><a name="iii.xiii-p1.5"></a>). David, accordingly, appeals to the promise thus given in order to obtain  what he asks: "Thou, O Lord of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy  servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath thy servant found in  his heart to pray this prayer unto thee" (<a name="iii.xiii-p1.6"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#027">2 Samuel 7:27</a><a name="iii.xiii-p1.6"></a>). Here we infer, that he  would have been afraid but for the promise which emboldened him. So in another  passage he fortifies himself with the general doctrine, "He will fulfil the  desire of them that fear him" (<a name="iii.xiii-p1.7"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#019">Psalm 145:19</a><a name="iii.xiii-p1.7"></a>). Nay, we may observe in The Psalms  how the continuity of prayer is broken, and a transition is made at one time to  the power of God, at another to his goodness, at another to the faithfulness of  his promises. It might seem that David, by introducing these sentiments,  unseasonably mutilates his prayers; but believers well know by experience, that  their ardour grows languid unless new fuel be added, and, therefore, that  meditation as well on the nature as on the word of God during prayer, is by no  means superfluous. Let us not decline to imitate the example of David, and  introduce thoughts which may reanimate our languid minds with new vigour.</p>
