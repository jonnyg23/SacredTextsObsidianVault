 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Of Prayer</i>, by John Calvin, tr. Henry  Beveridge [1845], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <a name="iii.xli"></a> <h4 align="center"><a name="iii.xli-p0.1"></a>41. </h4> 
 <p><a name="iii.xli-p1"></a>The first petition is, HALLOWED BE THY NAME. The necessity of  presenting it bespeaks our great disgrace. For what can be more unbecoming than  that our ingratitude and malice should impair, our audacity and petulance should  as much as in them lies destroy, the glory of God? But though all the ungodly  should burst with sacrilegious rage, the holiness of God's name still shines  forth. Justly does the Psalmist exclaim, "According to thy name, O God, so is  thy praise unto the ends of the earth" (<a name="iii.xli-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#010">Psalm 48:10</a><a name="iii.xli-p1.1"></a>). For wherever God hath made  himself known, his perfections must be displayed, his power, goodness, wisdom,  justice, mercy, and truth, which fill us with admiration, and incite us to show  forth his praise. Therefore, as the name of God is not duly hallowed on the  earth, and we are otherwise unable to assert it, it is at least our duty to make  it the subject of our prayers. The sum of the whole is, It must be our desire  that God may receive the honour which is his due: that men may never think or  speak of him without the greatest reverence. The opposite of this reverence is  profanity, which has always been too common in the world, and is very prevalent  in the present day. Hence the necessity of the petition, which, if piety had any  proper existence among us, would be superfluous. But if the name of God is duly  hallowed only when separated from all other names it alone is glorified, we are  in the petition enjoined to ask not only that God would vindicate his sacred  name from all contempt and insult, but also that he would compel the whole human  race to reverence it. Then since God manifests himself to us partly by his word,  and partly by his works, he is not sanctified unless in regard to both of these  we ascribe to him what is due, and thus embrace whatever has proceeded from him,  giving no less praise to his justice than to his mercy. On the manifold  diversity of his works he has inscribed the marks of his glory, and these ought  to call forth from every tongue an ascription of praise. Thus Scripture will  obtain its due authority with us, and no event will hinder us from celebrating  the praises of God, in regard to every part of his government. On the other  hand, the petition implies a wish that all impiety which pollutes this sacred  name may perish and be extinguished, that everything which obscures or impairs  his glory, all detraction and insult, may cease; that all blasphemy being  suppressed, the divine majesty may be more and more signally displayed.</p>
