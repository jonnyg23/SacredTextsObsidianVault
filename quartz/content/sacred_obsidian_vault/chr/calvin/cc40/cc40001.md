 <p><a name="ii.i-p19"></a><b>1.</b> <i>But concerning the collection</i> Luke relates (<a name="ii.i-p19.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#028">Ac 11:28</a><a name="ii.i-p19.2"></a>) that the prediction of Agabus, foretelling that there would be a famine under Claudius Caesar, gave 			 occasion for alms being collected by the saints, with the view of affording help to the brethren in Jerusalem. For though the Prophet had foretold, that this calamity would be generally prevalent almost throughout the world, yet as they were more heavily oppressed with penury at Jerusalem, and as all the Gentile Churches were bound, if they would not be held guilty of very great ingratitude, to afford aid to that place from which they had received the gospel, every one, consequently, forgetful 			 of self, resolved to afford relief to Jerusalem. That the pressure of want was felt heavily at Jerusalem, appears from the Epistle to the Galatians, (<a name="ii.i-p19.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#010">Ga 2:10</a><a name="ii.i-p19.3"></a>,) where Paul relates, that he had been charged by the Apostles to stir up the Gentiles to afford help.   			  <a name="fr_148"></a><a href="#fn_148"><font size="1">149</font></a>
  			  Now the Apostles would never have given such a charge, had they not been constrained by necessity. Farther, this passage is an evidence of the truth of what Paul states there also — that he had been careful to exhort the Gentiles to afford help in such a case of necessity. Now, however, he prescribes the method of relief; and that the Corinthians may accede to it the more readily, he mentions that he had already prescribed it to the Churches 			 of Galatia; for they would necessarily be the more influenced by example, as we are wont to feel a natural backwardness to anything that is not ordinarily practiced. Now follows the method — by which he designed to cut off all hinderances and impediments.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="ii.i-p21"></a><a name="ii.i-p21.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.i-p22"></a><b>2.</b> <i>On one of the Sabbaths.</i> The end is this — that they may have their alms ready in time. He therefore exhorts them not to wait till he came, as anything that is done suddenly, and in a bustle, is not done well, but to contribute on the Sabbath what might seem good, and according as every 			 one’s ability might enable — that is, on the day on which they held their sacred assemblies. The clause rendered on <i>one of the Sabbaths, (</i><a name="ii.i-p22.1"></a>κατὰ μίαν σαββάτων<i>,) </i>Chrysostom explains to mean — <i>the first Sabbath. </i>In this I do not agree with him; for Paul means rather that they should contribute, one on one 			 Sabbath and another on another; or even each of them every Sabbath, if they chose. For he has an eye, first of all, to convenience, and farther, that the sacred assembly, in which the communion of saints is celebrated, might be an additional spur to them. Nor am I more inclined to admit the view taken by Chrysostom — that the term <i>Sabbath </i>is employed here to mean the <i>Lord’s day, </i>(<a name="ii.i-p22.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#010">Re 1:10</a><a name="ii.i-p22.2"></a>,) for the probability is, that the Apostles, at the beginning, retained the day that was already in use, but that afterwards, constrained by the superstition of the <i>Jews, </i>they set aside that day, and substituted another. Now the <i>Lord’s day </i>was made choice of, chiefly because our Lord’s 			 <i>resurrection </i>put an end to the shadows of the law. Hence the day itself puts us in mind of our Christian liberty. We may, however, very readily infer from this passage, that believers have always had a certain day of rest from labor — not as if the worship of God consisted in idleness, but because it is of importance for the common harmony, that a certain day should be appointed for holding sacred assemblies, as they cannot be held every day. 			 For as to Paul’s forbidding elsewhere (<a name="ii.i-p22.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#010">Ga 4:10</a><a name="ii.i-p22.3"></a>) that any distinction should be made between one day and another, <i>that </i>must be understood to be with a view to religion,   			  <a name="fr_149"></a><a href="#fn_149"><font size="1">150</font></a>
  			  and not with a view to polity or external order.   			  <a name="fr_150"></a><a href="#fn_150"><font size="1">151</font></a>
 </p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.i-p25"></a><i>Treasuring up</i> I have preferred to retain the Greek <i>participle, </i>as it appeared to me to be more emphatic.   			  <a name="fr_151"></a><a href="#fn_151"><font size="1">152</font></a>
  			  For although <a name="ii.i-p26.2"></a>θησανρίζειν means to <i>lay up, </i>yet in my opinion, he designed to admonish the Corinthians, that whatever they might contribute for the saints would be their best and safest <i>treasure. </i>For if a heathen poet could say 			 — “What riches you give away, those alone you shall always <i>have,</i>   			  <a name="fr_152"></a><a href="#fn_152"><font size="1">153</font></a>
  			  how much more ought that consideration to have influence among us, who are not dependent on the gratitude of men, but have God to look to, who makes himself a debtor in the room of the poor man, to restore to us one day, with large interest, whatever we give away? (<a name="ii.i-p27.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#017">Pr 19:17</a><a name="ii.i-p27.4"></a>.) Hence this statement of Paul corresponds with that 			 saying of Christ —</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="ii.i-p28"></a>Lay up for yourselves treasure in heaven, where it will not be exposed either to thieves, or to moths. (<a name="ii.i-p28.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#020">Mt 6:20</a><a name="ii.i-p28.1"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.i-p29"></a><i>According as he has prospered.</i> Instead of this the old translation has rendered it, <i>What may seem good to him, </i>misled, no doubt, by the resemblance between the word made use of, and another.   			  <a name="fr_153"></a><a href="#fn_153"><font size="1">154</font></a>
  			  Erasmus renders it, <i>What will be convenient.</i>   			  <a name="fr_154"></a><a href="#fn_154"><font size="1">155</font></a>
  			  Neither the one nor the other pleased me, for this reason — that the proper signification of the word brings out a meaning that is much more suitable; for it means — to <i>go on prosperously. </i>Hence he calls every one to consider his ability — “Let every one, according as God hath blessed him, lay out upon the poor from his increase.”</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="ii.i-p32"></a><a name="ii.i-p32.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.i-p33"></a><b>3.</b> <i>And when I come</i> As we are cheerful in giving, when we know for certain, that what we give is well laid out, he points out to the Corinthians a method, by which they may be assured of a good and faithful administration — by selecting approved persons, to whom they may intrust the matter. 			 Nay more, he offers his own services, if desired, which is an evidence that he has the matter at heart.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="ii.i-p34"></a><a name="ii.i-p34.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.i-p35"></a><b>5.</b> <i>When I shall pass through Macedonia</i> The common opinion is, that this espistle was sent from Philippi. Persons coming thence to Corinth by land, required to pass through Macedonia; for that colony is situated in the farthest extremity, towards the Emathian mountains. Paul, it is true, 			 might, instead of going by land, have gone thither by sea, but he was desirous to visit the Macedonian Churches, that he might confirm them in passing. So much for the common opinion. To me, however, it appears more probable, that the epistle was written at Ephesus; for he says a little afterwards, that <i>he will remain there until Pentecost, </i>(<a name="ii.i-p35.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#008">1Co 16:8</a><a name="ii.i-p35.2"></a>)   			  <a name="fr_155"></a><a href="#fn_155"><font size="1">156</font></a>
  			 ; and he salutes the Corinthians, not in the name of the Philippians, but of the <i>Asiatics. </i>(<a name="ii.i-p36.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#019">1Co 16:19</a><a name="ii.i-p36.1"></a>.)   			  <a name="fr_156"></a><a href="#fn_156"><font size="1">157</font></a>
  			  Besides, in the second epistle he explicitly states, that, after he had sent away this epistle, he passed over into Macedonia. (<a name="ii.i-p37.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#013">2Co 2:13</a><a name="ii.i-p37.1"></a>.) Now after passing through Macedonia, he would be at a distance from Ephesus, and in the neighborhood of Achaia. Hence I have no doubt that he was at Ephesus at that time: 			 <i>thence </i>he could sail by a straight course to Achaia. For visiting Macedonia, a long circuit was needed, and a more disagreeable route. Accordingly he lets them know that he will not come to them by a direct course, as he required to <i>go through Macedonia</i></p>  		  
 <p class="Super"><a name="ii.i-p38"></a>To the Corinthians, however, he promises something farther — that he would <i>make a longer stay with them</i> By this he shows his affection towards them. For what reason had he for delay, except that he was concerned as to their welfare? On the other hand, he lets them know how fully assured he is of their affection 			 towards him in return, by taking it, as it were, for granted that he would be conducted forward by them in the way of kindness; for he says this from <i>confidence </i>in their friendship.   			  <a name="fr_157"></a><a href="#fn_157"><font size="1">158</font></a>
 </p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.i-p40"></a>After saying everything, however, he subjoins this limitation —<i> if the Lord permit</i> With this reservation, saints ought to follow up all their plans and deliberations; for it is an instance of great rashness to undertake and determine many things for the future, while we have not even a moment in our power. The 			 main thing indeed is, that, in the inward affection of the mind, we submit to God and his providence, whatever we resolve upon;   			  <a name="fr_158"></a><a href="#fn_158"><font size="1">159</font></a>
  			  but at <i>the </i>same time, it is becoming that we should accustom ourselves to such forms of expression, that whenever we have to do with what is future we may make everything depend on the divine will.   			  <a name="fr_159"></a><a href="#fn_159"><font size="1">160</font></a>

 <p><a name="ii.ii-p16"></a><b>8.</b> <i>I will remain.</i> From this statement I have argued above, that this epistle was sent from Ephesus, rather than from Philippi. For the probability is, that the Apostle speaks of the place in which he was at the time, and not of a place, in going to which he would 			 require to make a long circuit; and farther, in passing through Macedonia,   			  <a name="fr_162"></a><a href="#fn_162"><font size="1">163</font></a>
  			  it would have been necessary to leave Corinth when already in the neighborhood of it, and cross the sea in order to reach Ephesus. He accordingly tells them beforehand that he will <i>remain at Ephesus until Pentecost, </i>adding the reason — in order that they may wait for him the more patiently. Erasmus has preferred to render it — 			 <i>until the fiftieth day, </i>influenced by frivolous conjectures rather than by any solid argument. He objects, that there was as yet no day of Pentecost appointed among Christians, as it is now celebrated; and this I grant. He says, that it ought not to be understood as referring to the Jewish solemnity, because in various instances he annuls and condemns the superstitious observance of days. (<a name="ii.ii-p17.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#010">Ga 4:10</a><a name="ii.ii-p17.2"></a>; <a name="ii.ii-p17.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#005">Ro 14:5</a><a name="ii.ii-p17.3"></a>; <a name="ii.ii-p17.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#016">Col. 2:16</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#017">17</a><a name="ii.ii-p17.4"></a>.) I do not concede to him, however, that Paul celebrated that day at Ephesus from being influenced by a superstitious regard to the 			 day, but because there would be a larger assembly at that time, and he hoped that, in that way, an opportunity would be presented to him of propagating the gospel. Thus, when he was hastening forward to Jerusalem, he assigned as the reason of his haste, <i>that he might arrive there at Pentecost, </i>(<a name="ii.ii-p17.5"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#016">Ac 20:16</a><a name="ii.ii-p17.5"></a>;) but while others presented 			 themselves there for the purpose of sacrificing according to the ritual of the law, he himself had another object in view — that his ministry might be the more useful in proportion to the largeness of the attendance. It were, however, an excessively poor meaning to understand Paul here as simply specifying fifty days. Besides, when he expressly says <a name="ii.ii-p17.6"></a>τὴν πεντηκοστήν <i>(the 			 Pentecost,) </i>he cannot but be understood as speaking of a particular day. As to this festival, see <a name="ii.ii-p17.7"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#016">Le 23:16</a><a name="ii.ii-p17.7"></a></p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="ii.ii-p18"></a><a name="ii.ii-p18.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.ii-p19"></a><b>9.</b> <i>For a great and effectual door is opened to me. </i>He assigns two reasons for remaining for a longer time at Ephesus — 1st, Because an opportunity is afforded him there of furthering the gospel; and 2dly, Because, in consequence of the great number of <i>adversaries </i>that were there, his presence was particularly required. “I shall do much good by prolonging my stay here for a little while, and were I absent, Satan would do much injury.” In the first clause, he makes use of a metaphor that is quite in common use, when he employs the term <i>door </i>as meaning <i>an opportunity. </i>For the Lord opened up a way for him for the furtherance of the gospel. He 			 calls this a <i>great </i>door, because he could gain many. He calls it <i>effectual, </i>inasmuch as the Lord blessed his labor, and rendered his doctrine <i>effectual </i>by the power of His Spirit. We see, then, how this holy man   			  <a name="fr_163"></a><a href="#fn_163"><font size="1">164</font></a>
  			  sought everywhere Christ’s glory, and did not select a place with a view to his own convenience or his own pleasure; but simply looked to this — <i>where </i>he might do most good, and serve his Lord with most abundant fruit; and in addition to this, he did not merely not shrink back from hardships, but presented himself, of his own accord, where he saw that he would have to contend more keenly, and 			 with greater difficulty. For the reason why he <i>remained</i>   			  <a name="fr_164"></a><a href="#fn_164"><font size="1">165</font></a>
  			  was, that <i>many adversaries</i> were at hand; and the better equipped he was for enduring their assault, he required to be so much the better prepared, and the more resolute.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="ii.ii-p22"></a><a name="ii.ii-p22.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.ii-p23"></a><b>10.</b> <i>But if Timothy come.</i> He speaks as if he were not as yet certain as to his coming. Now he charges them as to Timothy, so that he may be with them in safety — not as though he were in danger of his life among them, but because he would have enemies of Christ 			   			  <a name="fr_165"></a><a href="#fn_165"><font size="1">166</font></a>
  			  to oppose him. He wishes, therefore, that they should carefully take heed that no injury be done to him.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.ii-p25"></a>He adds the reason — for he <i>worketh the work of the Lord</i> Hence we infer, that the Church of Christ ought to be concerned for the preservation of the lives of ministers. And assuredly, it is reasonable, that, in proportion as an individual is endowed with superior gifts for the edification of believers, and 			 applies himself to it the more strenuously, his life ought to be so much dearer to us.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.ii-p26"></a>The clause — <i>as I also do, </i>is made use of, either to express his <i>excellence, </i>or simply to point out the similarity as to office, inasmuch as both labored in the word.</p>

 <p><a name="ii.ii-p28"></a><b>11.</b> <i>Let no man, therefore, despise him</i> Here we have a <i>second </i>charge, <i>that they may not despise </i>him — perhaps because he was as yet of a youthful age, which usually draws forth less 			 respect. He wishes them, therefore, to take care, that there be no hinderance in the way of this faithful minister of Christ being held in due esteem — unless, perhaps, it be that Paul reckoned this very thing to be an evidence of contempt, if they were not concerned, as it became them to be, in reference to his life. This injunction, however, appears to include something farther, that they should not undervalue Timothy, from ignorance of his worth.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.ii-p29"></a>In the <i>third </i>place, he charges them to <i>conduct him forward in peace, </i>or, in other words, <i>safe from all harm, </i>for <i>peace </i>here means safety.</p>

 <p><a name="ii.ii-p31"></a><b>12.</b> <i>As to our brother Apollos.</i> He had succeeded Paul in the work of building up the Corinthians; and hence he has in previous passages ascribed to him the office of <i>watering. </i>(<a name="ii.ii-p31.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#006">1Co 3:6</a><a name="ii.ii-p31.1"></a>, and <a name="ii.ii-p31.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#001">Ac 19:1</a><a name="ii.ii-p31.2"></a>.) He now states a reason why he does not come with the others, and he states the reason of this, in order that the Corinthians may not suspect that he had been hindered by him.

 <p><a name="ii.iii-p31"></a><b>13.</b> <i>Watch ye</i>. A short exhortation, but of great weight. He exhorts them to <i>watch, </i>in order that Satan may not oppress them, finding them off their guard. For as the warfare is incessant, the <i>watching </i>requires to 			 be incessant too. Now watchfulness of spirit is this — when, free and disentangled from earthly cares, we meditate on the things of God. For as the body is weighed down by <i>surfeiting and drunkenness, </i>(<a name="ii.iii-p31.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#034">Lu 21:34</a><a name="ii.iii-p31.1"></a>,) so as to be fit for nothing, so the cares and lusts of the world, idleness or carelessness, are like a spiritual surfeiting 			 that overpowers the mind.   			  <a name="fr_168"></a><a href="#fn_168"><font size="1">169</font></a>
 </p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.iii-p33"></a>The <i>second </i>thing is that they <i>persevere in the faith, </i>or that they hold fast the faith, so as to <i>stand firm; </i>because that is the foundation on which we rest. It is certain, however, that he points out the means 			 of perseverance — by resting upon God with a firm faith.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.iii-p34"></a>In the <i>third </i>exhortation, which is much of the same nature, he stirs them up to manly fortitude. And, as we are naturally weak, he exhorts them <i>fourthly to </i>strengthen themselves, or gather strength. For where we render it <i>be strong, 			 </i>Paul makes use of only one word, which is equivalent to <i>strengthen yourselves.</i></p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="ii.iii-p35"></a><a name="ii.iii-p35.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.iii-p36"></a><b>14.</b> <i>Let all your things be done in love</i> Again he repeats what is the rule in all those transactions, in which we have dealings with one another. He wishes, then, that <i>love </i>shall be the directress; because the Corinthians erred chiefly 			 in this respect — that every one looked to himself without caring for others.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="ii.iii-p37"></a><a name="ii.iii-p37.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.iii-p38"></a><b>15.</b> <i>Ye know the house of Stephanas</i> We know, from daily experience, of what advantage it is, that those should have the highest authority, whom God has adorned with the most distinguished gifts. Accordingly, if we wish to secure the welfare of the Church, let us always take care that 			 honor be conferred upon the good: let their counsels have the greatest weight; let others give way to them, and allow themselves to be governed by their prudence. This Paul does in this instance, when admonishing the Corinthians to show respect to the <i>house of Stephanas. </i>Some manuscripts add, <i>and Fortunatus.</i>   			  <a name="fr_169"></a><a href="#fn_169"><font size="1">170</font></a>
  			  For God manifests himself to us when he shows us the gifts of his Spirit. Hence, if we would not appear to be despisers of God, let us voluntarily <i>submit ourselves </i>to those, on whom God has conferred superior gifts.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.iii-p40"></a>Now, that they may be the more inclined to put honor upon <i>that house, </i>(for as to the other, it appears to me to be, in this place at least, a spurious addition,) he reminds them that they were the <i>first-fruits of Achaia, </i>that is, that the household of Stephanas 			 were the first that had embraced the gospel. Not indeed as though the first in order of time were in every case superior to the others, but where there is perseverance along with this, it is with good reason, that honor is conferred upon those, who have in a manner paved the way for the gospel by promptitude of faith. It must be observed, however, that he dignifies with this honorable title those, who had consecrated to believers their services and resources. For the same reason, he bestows 			 commendation a little afterwards upon Fortunatus and Achaicus, that, in proportion to a man’s superiority of excellence,   			  <a name="fr_170"></a><a href="#fn_170"><font size="1">171</font></a>
  			  he might be held so much the more in esteem, that he might be able to do the more good. Farther, in order that the Corinthians may be the more disposed to love them, he says, that <i>what had been wanting</i> on the part of their entire Church <i>had been 			 compensated for </i>by their vicarious services.</p>

 <p><a name="ii.iii-p43"></a><b>19.</b> <i>With the Church that is in their house</i> A magnificent eulogium, inasmuch as the name of the Church is applied to a single family! At the same time it is befitting, that all the families of the pious should be regulated in such a manner as to be so many little Churches. As to the term <i>Congregation, </i>which Erasmus has used in preference, it is foreign to Paul’s design; for it was not his intention to designate a crowd of persons by a mere common term, but to speak in honorable terms of the management of a Christian household. His saluting them in the name of Aquila and Priscilla, confirms what I have noticed above — that the Epistle was written at Ephesus, not at Philippi. 			 For Luke informs us, that they remained at Ephesus, when Paul went elsewhere. (<a name="ii.iii-p43.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#019">Ac 18:19</a><a name="ii.iii-p43.2"></a>.)</p>

 <p><a name="ii.iii-p45"></a><b>20.</b> <i>Salute one another with a holy kiss.</i> The practice of kissing was very common among the Jews, as is manifest from the Scriptures. In <i>Greece, </i>though it was not so common and customary, it was by no means unknown; 			 but the probability is, that Paul speaks here of a solemn kiss, with which they saluted each other in the sacred assembly. For I could easily believe, that from the times of the Apostles a kiss was used in connection with the administration of the Supper;   			  <a name="fr_171"></a><a href="#fn_171"><font size="1">172</font></a>
  			  in place of which, among nations that were somewhat averse to the practice of kissing, there crept in the custom of kissing the patine.   			  <a name="fr_172"></a><a href="#fn_172"><font size="1">173</font></a>
  			  However this may be, as it was a token of mutual love. I have no doubt, that Paul meant to exhort them to the cultivation of good-will among themselves — not merely in their minds   			  <a name="fr_173"></a><a href="#fn_173"><font size="1">174</font></a>
  			  and in needful services, but also by that token, provided only it was <i>holy, </i>that is, neither unchaste nor deceitful,   			  <a name="fr_174"></a><a href="#fn_174"><font size="1">175</font></a>
  			  — though, at the same time, <i>holy </i>may be taken to mean <i>sacred.</i></p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="ii.iii-p50"></a><a name="ii.iii-p50.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.iii-p51"></a><b>22.</b> <i>If any man love not the Lord Jesus</i> The close of the Epistle consists of <i>three </i>parts. He entreats the grace of Christ in behalf of the Corinthians: he makes a declaration of his love towards them, and, with the severest threatening, 			 he inveighs against those that falsely took upon themselves the Lord’s name, while not loving him from the heart. For he is not speaking of strangers, who avowedly hated the Christian name, but of pretenders and hypocrites, who troubled the Churches for the sake of their own belly, or from empty boasting.   			  <a name="fr_175"></a><a href="#fn_175"><font size="1">176</font></a>
  			  On such persons he denounces an anathema, and he also pronounces a curse upon them. It is not certain, however, whether he desires their destruction in the presence of God, or whether he wishes to render them odious — nay, even execrable, in the view of believers. Thus in <a name="ii.iii-p52.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#008">Ga 1:8</a><a name="ii.iii-p52.2"></a>, when pronouncing one who corrupts the Gospel to 			 be <i>accursed,</i>   			  <a name="fr_176"></a><a href="#fn_176"><font size="1">177</font></a>
  			  he does not mean that he was rejected or condemned by God, but he declares that he is to be abhorred by us. I expound it in a simple way as follows: “Let them perish and be cut off, as being the pests of the Church.” And truly, there is nothing that is more pernicious, than that class of persons, who prostitute a profession of piety to their own depraved affections. Now he points out the origin of this evil, when he says, that they do not 			 love Christ, for a sincere and earnest love to Christ will not suffer us to give occasion of offense to brethren.   			  <a name="fr_177"></a><a href="#fn_177"><font size="1">178</font></a>
 </p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.iii-p55"></a>What he immediately <i>adds</i> — <i>Maranatha, </i>is somewhat more difficult. Almost all of the ancients are agreed, that they are Syriac terms.   			  <a name="fr_178"></a><a href="#fn_178"><font size="1">179</font></a>
  			  <i>Jerome, </i>however, explains it: <i>The Lord cometh; </i>while others render it, <i>At the coming of the Lord, </i>or, <i>Until the Lord comes. </i>Every one, however, I think, must see how silly and puerile is the idea, that the Apostle spoke to Greeks in the Syriac tongue, when meaning to 			 say — <i>The Lord has come. </i>Those who translate it, <i>at the coming of the Lord, </i>do so on mere conjecture; and besides, there is not much plausibility in that interpretation. How much more likely it is, that this was a customary form of expression among the Hebrews, when they wished to excommunicate any one. For the Apostles never speak in foreign tongues, except when they repeat anything in the 			 person of another, as for example, <i>Eli, Eli, lammah sabathani, </i>(<a name="ii.iii-p56.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#046">Mt 27:46</a><a name="ii.iii-p56.2"></a>,) <i>Talitha cumi, </i>(<a name="ii.iii-p56.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#041">Mr 5:41</a><a name="ii.iii-p56.3"></a>,) and <i>Ephphata, </i>(<a name="ii.iii-p56.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#034">Mr 7:34</a><a name="ii.iii-p56.4"></a>,) or when they make use of a word that has come into common use, as <i>Amen</i> — <i>Hosanna. </i>Let us see, then, whether <i>Maranatha </i>suits with excommunication. Now 			 Bullinger,   			  <a name="fr_179"></a><a href="#fn_179"><font size="1">180</font></a>
  			  on the authority of Theodore Bibliander, has affirmed, that, in the Chaldee dialect, <i>Maharamata </i>has the same meaning as the Hebrew term <a name="ii.iii-p61.1"></a>חרם, <i>cherem, (accursed,)</i>   			  <a name="fr_180"></a><a href="#fn_180"><font size="1">181</font></a>
  			  and I was myself at one time assured of the same thing by Wolfgang Capito,   			  <a name="fr_181"></a><a href="#fn_181"><font size="1">182</font></a>
  			  a man of blessed memory It is nothing unusual, however, for the Apostles to write such terms differently from the way in which they are pronounced in the language from which they are derived; as may be seen even from the instances brought forward above. Paul, then, after pronouncing an anathema on those who <i>do not love 			 Christ,</i>   			  <a name="fr_182"></a><a href="#fn_182"><font size="1">183</font></a>
  			  deeply affected with the seriousness of the matter, as if he reckoned that he had not said enough, added a term that was in common use among the Jews, and which they made use of in pronouncing a sentence of anathema — just as if, speaking in Latin, I should say, “I excommunicate thee,” but if I add — “and pronounce thee an anathema,” this would be an expression of more intense 			 feeling.   			  <a name="fr_183"></a><a href="#fn_183"><font size="1">184</font></a>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="ii.iii-p46"></a> “That the Apostle,” says Dr. Brown in his Commentary on 1st Peter, “meant the members of the Churches, on receiving this Epistle, to salute one another is certain; that he meant, that at all their religious meetings they should do so, is not <i>improbable. </i>That he meant to make this an everlasting ordinance in all Christian Churches, though it has sometimes been asserted, has never been proved, and is by no means likely. That the practice 				  prevailed extensively, perhaps universally, in the earlier ages, is established on satisfactory evidence. ‘After the prayers,’ says Justin Martyr, who lived in the earlier part of the second century, giving an account in his Apology of the religious customs of the Christians — ’after the prayers, we embrace each other with a kiss.’ Tertullian speaks of it as an ordinary part of the religious services of the Lord’s day; and in the Apostolical Constitutions, as they are <i>termed, </i>the manner 				  in which it was performed is particularly described. ‘Then let the men apart, and the women apart, salute each other with a kiss in the Lord.’ Origen’s Note on <a name="ii.iii-p46.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#016">Ro 16:16</a><a name="ii.iii-p46.1"></a>, is: ‘From this passage the custom was delivered to the Churches, that, after prayer, the brethren should salute one another with a kiss.’ This token of love was generally given at the Holy Supper. It was likely, from the prevalence of this 				  custom, that the calumny of Christians indulging in licentiousness at their religious meetings originated; and it is not improbable that, in order to remove everything like an occasion to calumniators, the practice which, though in itself innocent, had become not for the use of edifying, was <i>discontinued.”</i> — <i>Brown’s </i>Expository Discourses on 1st Peter, volume in. pages 309, 310. “It is remarkable that, by the testimony of Suetonius, an edict was published by one of the Roman 				  Emperors, for the abolition of this practice among his subjects, — perhaps in order to check abuses, for the prevention of which our Apostle enjoins that it shall be a <i>holy salutation.”</i> — <i>Chalmers </i>on the Romans, volume in. page 428. — Ed.</p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="ii.iii-p47"></a> By the <a name="ii.iii-p47.1"></a><i>patine</i> or <a name="ii.iii-p47.2"></a><i>paten</i><i>, </i>is meant the <i>plate </i>or <i>salver </i>on which the wafer or bread was placed in the observance of the mass. The term is made use of by <i>Dr. Stillingfleet </i>in his “Preservative from Popery,” (title 7, chapter 5,) in speaking of the practice of the Church of Rome in the 				  adoration of the host: “The priest in every mass, as soon as he has consecrated the bread and wine, with bended knees, he adores the sacrament; that which he has consecrated, that very thing which is before him, upon the <a name="ii.iii-p47.3"></a><i>patine</i><i>, </i>and in the chalice; and gives the same worship and subjection, both of body and mind, to it as he could to God or Christ himself.” In <i>Young’s </i>Lectures on Popery, (Loud. 1836,) page 140, the 				  following account is given of the sacrifice of the mass: “Upon the altar is the chalice, or cup, which is to contain the wine, mixed with a little water; and covering the cup is the <a name="ii.iii-p47.4"></a><i>paten</i><i>, </i>or <i>plate, </i>intended to hold the cake or wafer. After an almost endless variety of movements, and forms, and prayers, and readings, the priest goes to the altar, and, taking the cup containing wine and water, with the wafer upon the 				  <i>cover,</i> — <i>these </i>having been before consecrated and transubstantiated into the body and blood of Christ, — he raises his eyes and says, ‘Take, O Holy Trinity, this oblation, which I, unworthy sinner, offer in honor of thee, of the blessed Virgin Mary, and of all the saints, for the salvation of the living, and for the rest and quiet of all the faithful that are dead.’ Then, setting down the chalice, he says, ‘Let this sacrifice be acceptable to Almighty <i>God.’” </i>The name 				  <a name="ii.iii-p47.5"></a><i>paten</i> is preserved in the English Liturgy to this day. In the prayer of consecration, in the communion service — in connection with the words, <i>“who, </i>in the same night that he was betrayed, took bread,” it is said, <i>“here </i>the priest is to take the <i>paten </i>into his hands.” Calvin, when commenting upon <a name="ii.iii-p47.6"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#016">Ro 16:16</a><a name="ii.iii-p47.6"></a>, after 				  having stated that it was customary among the primitive Christians, before partaking of the Lord’s Supper, to kiss each other in token of sacred friendship, and afterwards to give alms, says, <i>“</i><a name="ii.iii-p47.7"></a><i>Hinc </i>fluxit ritus ille, qui hodie est apud Papistas, <i>osculandoe patents, </i>et conferendse oblationis. Quorum alterum merae est superstitionis, sine ullo fructu: alterum non alto facit, nisi ad explendam sacerdotum avari-tiam, si tamen 				  expleri posset;<i>”</i> — <i>“</i>From this has sprung that ceremony which is at this day among Papists, of <i>kissing the patine, </i>and making an offering. The former is mere superstition without any advantage: the latter serves no purpose, except to <i>satisfy </i>the greed of the priests, if <i>satis</i>fied it can be.” <i>­Poole, </i>in his Annotations on <a name="ii.iii-p47.8"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#016">Ro 16:16</a><a name="ii.iii-p47.8"></a>, says, “The primitive 				  Christians did use it” (the <i>holy kiss) “in </i>their assemblies; so <i>Tertullian </i>testifieth, (Lib. Dec.,) and they did it especially in receiving the Eucharist. So Chrysostom witnesseth, (Hom. 77 in <a name="ii.iii-p47.9"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#000">John 16</a><a name="ii.iii-p47.9"></a>,) ‘we do well,’ saith he, ‘to <i>kiss in the mysteries, </i>that we may become <i>one.’</i> This custom for good reasons is laid down, and the <i>Romanists </i>in room of it, keep up a foolish and superstitious ceremony, which is to <i>kiss the pax </i>in the mass.” — Ed.</p>
