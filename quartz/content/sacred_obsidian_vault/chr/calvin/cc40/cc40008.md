 <p><a name="ix.i-p9"></a> </p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="ix.i-p10"></a><a name="ix.i-p10.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.i-p11"></a><b>1.</b> <i>Do we begin</i> It appears that this objection also was brought forward against him — that he was excessively fond of publishing his own exploits, and brought against him, too, by those who were grieved to find that the fame, which they were eagerly desirous to obtain, was effectually 			 obstructed in consequence of his superior excellence. They had already, in my opinion, found fault with the former Epistle, on this ground, that he indulged immoderately in commendations of himself. To <i>commend</i> here means to boast foolishly and beyond measure, or at least to recount one’s own praises in a spirit of ambition. Paul’s calumniators had a plausible pretext — that it is a 			 disgusting   			  <a name="fr_358"></a><a href="#fn_358"><font size="1">359</font></a>
  			  and odious thing in itself for one to be the trumpeter of his own praises. Paul, however, had an excuse on the ground of <i>necessity, </i>inasmuch as he gloried, only because he was shut up to it. His design also raised him above all calumny, as he had nothing in view but that the honor of his apostleship might remain unimpaired for the edification of the Church; for had not Christ’s honor been infringed upon, he would 			 readily have allowed to pass unnoticed what tended to detract from his own reputation. Besides, he saw that it was very much against the Corinthians, that his authority was lessened among them. In the first place, therefore, he brings forward their calumny, letting them know that he is not altogether ignorant as to the kind of talk, that was current among them.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.i-p13"></a><i>Have we need?</i> The answer is suited (to use a common expression) to the person rather than to the thing, though we shall find him afterwards saying as much as was required in reference to the thing itself. At present, however, he reproves their malignity, inasmuch as they were displeased, if he at any time reluctantly, nay even when they themselves constrained him, 			 made mention of the grace that God had bestowed upon him, while they were themselves begging in all quarters for epistles, that were stuffed entirely with flattering commendations. He says that he has no need of commendation in words, while he is abundantly commended by his deeds. On the other hand, he convicts them of a greedy desire for glory, inasmuch as they endeavored to acquire favor through the suffrages of men.   			  <a name="fr_359"></a><a href="#fn_359"><font size="1">360</font></a>
  			  In this manner, he gracefully and appropriately repels their calumny. We must not, however, infer from this, that it is absolutely and in itself wrong to receive recommendations,   			  <a name="fr_360"></a><a href="#fn_360"><font size="1">361</font></a>
  			  provided you make use of them for a good purpose. For Paul himself recommends many; and this he would not have done had it been unlawful. Two things, however, are required here — <i>first</i>, that it be not a recommendation that is elicited by flattery, but an altogether unbiassed testimony;   			  <a name="fr_361"></a><a href="#fn_361"><font size="1">362</font></a>
  			  and <i>secondly</i>, that it be not given for the purpose of procuring advancement for the individual, but simply that it may be the means of promoting the advancement of Christ’s kingdom. For this reason, I have observed, that Paul has an eye to those who had assailed him with calumnies.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="ix.i-p17"></a><a name="ix.i-p17.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.i-p18"></a><b>2.</b> <i>Ye are our Epistle.</i> There is no little ingenuity in his making his own glory hinge upon the welfare of the Corinthians. “So long as you shall remain Christians, I shall have recommendation enough. For your faith speaks my praise, as being <i>the seal of my apostleship.</i>” (<a name="ix.i-p18.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#002">1Co 9:2</a><a name="ix.i-p18.1"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.i-p19"></a>When he says — <i>written in our hearts</i>, this may be understood in reference to Silvanus and Timotheus, and in that case the meaning will be: “We are not contented with this praise, that we derive from the thing itself. The recommendations, that others have, fly about before the eyes of men, but this, that <i>we 			 </i>have, has its seat in men’s consciences.” It may also be viewed as referring in part to the Corinthians, in this sense: “Those that obtain recommendations by dint of entreaty, have not in the conscience what they carry about written upon paper, and those that recommend others often do so rather by way of favor than from judgment. We, on the other hand, have the testimony of our apostleship, on this side and on that, engraven on men’s hearts.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.i-p20"></a><i>Which is known and read</i> It might also be read — “Which is known and <i>acknowledged,” </i>owing to the ambiguity of the word <a name="ix.i-p20.1"></a>ἀναγινωσκεσαι,   			  <a name="fr_362"></a><a href="#fn_362"><font size="1">363</font></a>
  			  and I do not know but that the latter might be more suitable. I was unwilling, however, to depart from the common rendering, when not constrained to do so. Only let the reader have this brought before his view, that he may consider which of the two renderings is the preferable one. If we render it <i>acknowledged, </i>there will be an implied contrast between an epistle that is sure and of unquestionable authority, and such 			 as are counterfeit.   			  <a name="fr_363"></a><a href="#fn_363"><font size="1">364</font></a>
  			  And, unquestionably, what immediately follows, is rather on the side of the latter rendering, for he brings forward the <i>Epistle of Christ, </i>in contrast with those that are forged and pretended.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="ix.i-p23"></a><a name="ix.i-p23.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.i-p24"></a><b>3.</b> <i>Ye are the Epistle of Christ</i> Pursuing the metaphor, he says that the Epistle of which he speaks was written by Christ, inasmuch as the faith of the Corinthians was his work. He says that it was <i>ministered</i> by him, as if meaning by this, that he had been in the place of ink and pen. In fine, he makes Christ the author and himself the instrument, that calumniators may understand, that it is with Christ that they have to do, if they continue to speak against him   			  <a name="fr_364"></a><a href="#fn_364"><font size="1">365</font></a>
  			  with malignity. What follows is intended to increase the authority of that <i>Epistle. </i>The second clause,   			  <a name="fr_365"></a><a href="#fn_365"><font size="1">366</font></a>
  			  however, has already a reference to the comparison that is afterwards drawn between the law and the gospel. For he takes occasion from this shortly afterwards, as we shall see, to enter upon a comparison of this nature. The antitheses here employed — <i>ink </i>and <i>Spirit, stones </i>and <i>heart</i> — give no small degree of weight to 			 his statements, by way of amplification. For in drawing a contrast between <i>ink</i> and the <i>Spirit of God</i>, and between <i>stones</i> and <i>heart, </i>he expresses more than if he had simply made mention of the <i>Spirit </i>and the <i>heart, </i>without drawing any comparison.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.i-p27"></a><i>Not on tables of stone</i>  He alludes to the promise that is recorded in <a name="ix.i-p27.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#031">Jer 31:31</a><a name="ix.i-p27.1"></a>, and <a name="ix.i-p27.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#026">Eze 37:26</a><a name="ix.i-p27.2"></a>, concerning the 			 grace of the New Testament.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.i-p28"></a>I will make, says he, a new covenant with them, not such as I had made with their fathers; but I will write my laws upon their hearts, and engrave them on their inward parts. Farther, I will take away the stony heart from the midst of thee, and will give thee a heart of flesh, that thou mayest walk in my precepts.<br> 			 (<a name="ix.i-p28.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#026">Ezek. 36:26</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#027">27</a><a name="ix.i-p28.2"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p class="Super"><a name="ix.i-p29"></a>Paul says, that this blessing was accomplished through means of his preaching. Hence it abundantly appears, that he is a faithful minister of the New Covenant — which is a legitimate testimony in favor of his apostleship. The epithet <i>fleshly</i> is not taken here in a bad sense, but means soft and flexible,  			  <a name="fr_366"></a><a href="#fn_366"><font size="1">367</font></a>
  			 as it is contrasted with <i>stony</i>, that is, hard and stubborn, as is the heart of man by nature, until it has been subdued by the Spirit of God.  			  <a name="fr_367"></a><a href="#fn_367"><font size="1">368</font></a>

 <p><a name="ix.ii-p21"></a><b>4.</b> <i>And such confidence</i> As it was a magnificent commendation, that Paul had pronounced to the honor of himself and his Apostleship, lest he should seem to speak of himself more confidently than was befitting, he transfers the entire glory to God, from whom he acknowledges that he has 			 received everything that he has. “By this boasting,” says he, “I extol God rather than myself, <i>by whose grace I am what I am.” </i>(<a name="ix.ii-p21.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#010">1Co 15:10</a><a name="ix.ii-p21.1"></a>.) He adds, as he is accustomed to do <i>by Christ, </i>because he is, as it 			 were, the channel, through which all God’s benefits flow forth to us.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="ix.ii-p22"></a><a name="ix.ii-p22.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p23"></a><b>5.</b> <i>Not that we are competent.</i>   			  <a name="fr_369"></a><a href="#fn_369"><font size="1">370</font></a>
  			  When he thus disclaims all merit, it is not as if he abased himself in merely pretended modesty, but instead of this, he speaks what he truly thinks. Now we see, that he leaves man nothing. For the smallest part, in a manner, of a good work is <i>thought</i>. In other words,   			  <a name="fr_370"></a><a href="#fn_370"><font size="1">371</font></a>
  			  it has neither the <i>first</i> part of the praise, nor the <i>second</i>; and yet he does not allow us even <i>this</i>. As it is less to<i> think </i>than to <i>will</i>, how foolish a part do those act, who 			 arrogate to themselves a right <i>will</i>, when Paul does not leave them so much as the power of <i>thinking</i> aught!   			  <a name="fr_371"></a><a href="#fn_371"><font size="1">372</font></a>
  			  Papists have been misled by the term <i>sufficiency</i>, that is made use of by the Old Interpreter.   			  <a name="fr_372"></a><a href="#fn_372"><font size="1">373</font></a>
  			  For they think to get off by acknowledging that man is not qualified to form good purposes, while in the mean time they ascribe to him a right apprehension of the mind, which, with some assistance from God, may effect something of itself. Paul, on the other hand, declares that man is in want, not merely of <i>sufficiency of himself</i>, (<a name="ix.ii-p27.1"></a>αὐτάρκειαν,) but also of <i>competency</i> (<a name="ix.ii-p27.2"></a>ἱκανότητα,)   			  <a name="fr_373"></a><a href="#fn_373"><font size="1">374</font></a>
  			  which would be equivalent to <a name="ix.ii-p28.2"></a><i>idoneitas</i> (fitness), if such a term were in use among the Latins. He could not, therefore, more effectually strip man bare of every thing good.   			  <a name="fr_374"></a><a href="#fn_374"><font size="1">375</font></a>
 </p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="ix.ii-p32"></a><a name="ix.ii-p32.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p33"></a><b>6.</b> <i>Who hath made us competent.</i>   			  <a name="fr_375"></a><a href="#fn_375"><font size="1">376</font></a>
  			  He had acknowledged himself to be altogether useless. Now he declares, that, by the grace of God, he has been qualified   			  <a name="fr_376"></a><a href="#fn_376"><font size="1">377</font></a>
  			  for an office, for which he was previously unqualified. From this we infer its magnitude and difficulty, as it can be undertaken by no one, that has not been previously prepared and fashioned for it by God. It is the Apostle’s intention, also, to extol the dignity of the gospel. There is, at the same time, no doubt, that he indirectly exposes the poverty of those, who boasted in lofty terms of their endowments, while they were not furnished with so much as a single 			 drop of heavenly grace.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p36"></a><i>Not of the letter but of the spirit</i> He now follows out the comparison between the law and the gospel, which he had previously touched upon. It is uncertain, however, whether he was led into this discussion, from seeing that there were at Corinth certain perverse   			  <a name="fr_377"></a><a href="#fn_377"><font size="1">378</font></a>
  			  devotees of the law, or whether he took occasion from something else to enter upon it. For my part, as I see no evidence that the false apostles had there confounded the law and the gospel, I am rather of opinion, that, as he had to do with lifeless declaimers, who endeavored to obtain applause through mere prating,   			  <a name="fr_378"></a><a href="#fn_378"><font size="1">379</font></a>
  			  and as he saw, that the ears of the Corinthians were captivated with such glitter, he was desirous to show them what was the chief excellence of the gospel, and what was the chief praise of its ministers. Now this he makes to consist in the efficacy of the Spirit. A comparison between the law and the gospel was fitted in no ordinary degree to show this. This appears to me to be the reason why he came to enter upon it.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p39"></a>There is, however, no doubt, that by the term <i>letter, </i>he means the Old Testament, as by the term <i>spirit </i>he means the gospel; for, after having called himself a <i>minister of the New Testament, </i>he immediately adds, by 			 way of exposition, that he is a <i>minister of the spirit, </i>and contrasts the <i>letter </i>with the <i>spirit. </i>We must now enquire into the reason of this designation. The exposition contrived by Origen has got into general circulation — that by the <i>letter </i>we ought to understand the grammatical and genuine 			 meaning of Scripture, or the <i>literal </i>sense, (as they call it,) and that by the <i>spirit </i>is meant the allegorical meaning, which is commonly reckoned to be the <i>spiritual </i>meaning. Accordingly, during several centuries, nothing was more commonly said, or more generally received, than this — that Paul here furnishes us with a key for expounding 			 Scripture by allegories, while nothing is farther from his intention. For by the term <i>letter </i>he means outward preaching, of such a kind as does not reach the heart; and, on the other hand, by <i>spirit </i>he means living doctrine, of such a nature as <i>worketh effectually </i>(<a name="ix.ii-p39.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#013">1Th 2:13</a><a name="ix.ii-p39.2"></a>) on the minds of men,   			  <a name="fr_379"></a><a href="#fn_379"><font size="1">380</font></a>
  			  through the grace of the Spirit. By the term <i>letter, </i>therefore, is meant <i>literal </i>preaching — that is, <i>dead </i>and <i>ineffectual, </i>perceived only by the ear. By the term <i>spirit, </i>on the other hand, is meant <i>spiritual </i>doctrine, that is, what is not merely uttered with the mouth, but effectually makes its way to the souls of men with a lively feeling. For Paul had an eye to the passage in Jeremiah, that I quoted a little ago, (<a name="ix.ii-p40.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#031">Jer 31:31</a><a name="ix.ii-p40.2"></a>,) where the Lord says, that his law had been proclaimed merely with the mouth, and that it had, therefore, been 			 of short duration, because the people did not embrace it in their heart, and he promises the Spirit of regeneration under the reign of Christ, to write his gospel, that is, the new covenant, upon their hearts. Paul now makes it his boast, that the accomplishment of that prophecy is to be seen in his preaching, that the Corinthians may perceive, how worthless is the loquacity of those vain boasters, who make incessant noise   			  <a name="fr_380"></a><a href="#fn_380"><font size="1">381</font></a>
  			  while devoid of the efficacy of the Spirit.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p42"></a>It is asked, however, whether God, under the Old Testament, merely sounded forth in the way of an external voice, and did not also speak inwardly to the hearts of the pious by his Spirit. I answer in the <i>first </i>place, that Paul here takes into view what belonged peculiarly to the law; for although God then wrought by his Spirit, yet that did not take its rise from the ministry of Moses, but from the grace of Christ, as it is said in 			 <a name="ix.ii-p42.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#017">Joh 1:17</a><a name="ix.ii-p42.1"></a> —</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="ix.ii-p43"></a>The law was given by Moses;<br> 			 but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p44"></a>True, indeed, the grace of God did not, during all that time, lie dormant, but it is enough that it was not a benefit that belonged to the law.  			  <a name="fr_381"></a><a href="#fn_381"><font size="1">382</font></a>
  			 For Moses had discharged his office, when he had delivered to the people the doctrine of life, adding threatenings and promises. For this reason he gives to the law the name of the <i>letter, </i>because it is in itself a dead preaching; but the gospel he calls <i>spirit, </i>because the ministry of the gospel is <i>living, </i>nay, <i>lifegiving. </i></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p46"></a>I answer secondly, that these things are not affirmed absolutely in reference either to the law or to the gospel, but in respect of the contrast between the one and the other; for even the gospel is not always spirit. When, however, we come to compare the two, it is truly and properly affirmed, that the nature of the law is to teach men literally, in such a way that it does not reach farther than the ear; and that, on the other hand, the 			 nature of the gospel is to teach spiritually, because it is the instrument of Christ’s grace. This depends on the appointment of God, who has seen it meet to manifest the efficacy of his Spirit more clearly in the gospel than in the law, for it is his work exclusively to teach effectually the minds of men.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p47"></a>When Paul, however, calls himself a <i>Minister of the Spirit</i>, he does not mean by this, that the grace of the Holy Spirit and his influence, were tied to his preaching, so that he could, whenever he pleased, breathe forth the Spirit along with the utterance of the voice. He simply means, that Christ blessed his ministry, and thus accomplished what was predicted respecting the gospel. It is one thing for Christ to connect his influence 			 with a man’s doctrine.  			  <a name="fr_382"></a><a href="#fn_382"><font size="1">383</font></a>
  			 and quite another for the man’s doctrine  			  <a name="fr_383"></a><a href="#fn_383"><font size="1">384</font></a>
  			 to have such efficacy of itself. We are, then, Ministers of the Spirit, not as if we held him inclosed within us, or as it were captive — not as if we could at our pleasure confer his grace upon all, or upon whom we pleased — but because Christ, through our instrumentality, illuminates the minds of men, renews their hearts, and, in short, regenerates them wholly.  			  <a name="fr_384"></a><a href="#fn_384"><font size="1">385</font></a>
  			 It is in consequence of there being such a connection and bond of union between Christ’s grace and man’s effort, that in many cases that is ascribed to the minister which belongs exclusively to the Lord. For in that case it is not the mere individual that is looked to, but the entire dispensation of the gospel, which consists, on the one hand, in the secret influence of Christ, and, on the other, in man’s outward efforts.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p51"></a><i>For the letter killeth</i>. This passage was mistakingly perverted, first by Origen, and afterwards by others, to a spurious signification. From this arose a very pernicious error — that of imagining that the perusal of Scripture would be not merely useless, but even injurious,   			  <a name="fr_385"></a><a href="#fn_385"><font size="1">386</font></a>
  			  unless it were drawn out into allegories. This error was the source of many evils. For there was not merely a liberty allowed of adulterating the genuine meaning of Scripture,   			  <a name="fr_386"></a><a href="#fn_386"><font size="1">387</font></a>
  			  but the more of audacity any one had in this manner of acting, so much the more eminent an interpreter of Scripture was he accounted. Thus many of the ancients recklessly played with the sacred word of God,   			  <a name="fr_387"></a><a href="#fn_387"><font size="1">388</font></a>
  			  as if it had been a ball to be tossed to and fro. In consequence of this, too, heretics had it more in their power to trouble the Church; for as it had become general practice to make any passage whatever   			  <a name="fr_388"></a><a href="#fn_388"><font size="1">389</font></a>
  			  mean anything that one might choose, there was no frenzy so absurd or monstrous, as not to admit of being brought forward under some pretext of allegory. Even good men themselves were carried headlong, so as to contrive very many mistaken opinions, led astray through a fondness for allegory.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p56"></a>The meaning of this passage, however, is as follows — that, if the word of God is simply uttered with the mouth, it is an occasion of death, and that it is lifegiving, only when it is received with the heart. The terms <i>letter</i> and <i>spirit</i>, therefore, do not refer to the exposition of the word, but to its influence and fruit. Why it is that the doctrine merely strikes upon the ear, without reaching the heart, we shall see 			 presently.</p>

 <p><a name="ix.ii-p58"></a><b>7</b>  <i>But if the ministry of death.</i> He now sets forth the dignity of the gospel by this argument — that God conferred distinguished honor upon the law, which, nevertheless, is nothing in comparison with the gospel. The law was rendered illustrious by many miracles. Paul, however, touches 			 here upon one of them merely — that the face of Moses shone with such splendor as dazzled the eyes of all. That splendour was a token of the glory of the law. He now draws an argument from the less to the greater — that it is befitting, that the glory of the gospel should shine forth with greater lustre, inasmuch as it is greatly superior to the law.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p59"></a>In the first place, he calls the law the <i>ministry of death</i>. Secondly, he says, that the doctrine of it was <i>written in letters, and with ink</i>. Thirdly, that it was <i>engraven on stones.</i> Fourthly, that it was not of perpetual duration; but, instead of this, its condition was 			 <i>temporary and fading</i>. And, fifthly, he calls it the <i>ministry of condemnation</i>. To render the antitheses complete, it would have been necessary for him to employ as many corresponding clauses in reference to the gospel; but, he has merely spoken of it as being the ministry of the Spirit, and of <i>righteousness</i>, and as enduring 			 for ever. If you examine the words, the correspondence is not complete, but so far as the matter itself is concerned, what is expressed is sufficient.   			  <a name="fr_389"></a><a href="#fn_389"><font size="1">390</font></a>
  			  For he had said that the <i>Spirit giveth life</i>, and farther, that men’s <i>hearts</i> served instead of <i>stones</i>, and <i>disposition</i>, in the place of <i>ink</i></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p70"></a>Let us now briefly examine those attributes of the law and the gospel. Let us, however, bear in mind, that he is not speaking of the whole of the doctrine that is contained in the law and the Prophets; and farther, that he is not treating of what happened to the fathers under the Old Testament, but merely notices what belongs peculiarly to the ministry of Moses. The law was <i>engraven on stones</i>, and hence it was a literal doctrine. This defect of the law required to be corrected by the gospel, because it could not but be brittle, so long as it was merely engraven on tables of stone. The gospel, therefore, is a holy and inviolable covenant, because it was contracted by the Spirit of God, acting as security. From this, too, it follows, that the law was the <i>ministry of 			 condemnation</i> and of <i>death</i>; for when men are instructed as to their duty, and hear it declared, that all who do not render satisfaction to the justice of God are cursed, (<a name="ix.ii-p70.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#026">De 27:26</a><a name="ix.ii-p70.1"></a>,) they are convicted, as under sentence of sin and death. From the law, therefore, they derive nothing but a 			 condemnation of this nature, because God there demands what is due to him, and at the same time confers no power to perform it. The gospel, on the other hand, by which men are regenerated, and are reconciled to God, through the free remission of their sins, is the ministry of righteousness, and, consequently, of life also.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p71"></a>Here, however, a question arises: As the gospel is the odor of death unto death to some, (<a name="ix.ii-p71.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#016">2Co 2:16</a><a name="ix.ii-p71.1"></a>,) and as Christ is a rock of offense, and a stone of stumbling set for the ruin of many,  			  <a name="fr_390"></a><a href="#fn_390"><font size="1">391</font></a>
  			 (<a name="ix.ii-p72.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#034">Lu 2:34</a><a name="ix.ii-p72.2"></a>; <a name="ix.ii-p72.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#008">1Pe 2:8</a><a name="ix.ii-p72.3"></a>,) why does he represent, as belonging exclusively to the law, what is common to both? Should you reply, that it happens accidentally that the gospel is the source of death, and, accordingly, it the occasion of it rather than the cause, inasmuch as it is in its own nature salutary to all, the difficulty 			 will still remain unsolved; for the same answer might be returned with truth in reference to the law. For we hear what Moses called the people to bear witness to — that he had set before them life and death. (<a name="ix.ii-p72.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#015">De 30:15</a><a name="ix.ii-p72.4"></a>.) We hear what Paul himself says in <a name="ix.ii-p72.5"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#010">Ro 7:10</a><a name="ix.ii-p72.5"></a> — that the law has turned out to our ruin, not 			 through any fault attaching to it, but in consequence of our wickedness. Hence, as the entailing of condemnation upon men is a thing that happens alike to the law and the gospel, the difficulty still remains.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p73"></a>My answer is this — that there is, notwithstanding of this, a great difference between them; for although the gospel is an occasion of condemnation to many, it is nevertheless, on good grounds, reckoned the doctrine of life, because it is the instrument of regeneration, and offers to us a free reconciliation with God. The law, on the other hand, as it simply prescribes the rule of a good life, does not renew men’s hearts to the obedience of 			 righteousness, and denounces everlasting death upon transgressors, can do nothing but condemn.  			  <a name="fr_391"></a><a href="#fn_391"><font size="1">392</font></a>
  			 Or if you prefer it in another way, the office of the law is to show us the disease, in such a way as to show us, at the same time, no hope of cure: the office of the gospel is, to bring a remedy to those that were past hope. For as the law leaves man to himself, it condemns him, of necessity, to death; while the gospel, bringing him to Christ, opens the gate of life. Thus, in one word, we find that it is an accidental property of the law, that is perpetual and inseparable, that it 			 killeth; for as the Apostle says elsewhere, (<a name="ix.ii-p74.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#010">Ga 3:10</a><a name="ix.ii-p74.2"></a>,)</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="ix.ii-p75"></a>All that remain under the law are subject to the curse.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p76"></a>It does, not, on the other hand, invariably happen to the gospel, that it <i>kills, </i>for in it is</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="ix.ii-p77"></a>revealed the righteousness of God from faith to faith, and therefore it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth. (<a name="ix.ii-p77.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016">Rom. 1:16</a>, Rom. 17:0<a name="ix.ii-p77.1"></a>.)   			  <a name="fr_392"></a><a href="#fn_392"><font size="1">393</font></a>
 </p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p79"></a>It remains, that we consider the last of the properties that are ascribed. The Apostle says, that the law was but for a time, and required to be abolished, but that the gospel, on the other hand, remains for ever. There are various reasons why the ministry of Moses is pronounced transient, for it was necessary that the shadows should vanish at the coming of Christ, and that statement —</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="ix.ii-p80"></a>The law and the Prophets were until John —<br> 			 (<a name="ix.ii-p80.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#013">Mt 11:13</a><a name="ix.ii-p80.2"></a>)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p81"></a>— applies to more than the mere shadows. For it intimates, that Christ has put an end to the ministry of Moses, which was peculiar to him, and is distinguished from the gospel. Finally, the Lord declares by Jeremiah, that the weakness of the Old Testament arose from this — that it was not engraven on men’s hearts. (<a name="ix.ii-p81.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#032">Jer. 31:32</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#033">33</a><a name="ix.ii-p81.1"></a>.) 			 For my part, I understand that abolition of the law, of which mention is here made, as referring to the whole of the Old Testament, in so far as it is opposed to the gospel, so that it corresponds with the statement — <i>The law and the Prophets were until John. </i>For the context requires this. For Paul is not reasoning here as to mere ceremonies, but shows how much more powerfully the Spirit of God exercises his power in the gospel, than of old under the law.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.ii-p82"></a><i>So that they could not look.</i> He seems to have had it in view to reprove, indirectly, the arrogance of those, who despised the gospel as a thing that was excessively mean,   			  <a name="fr_393"></a><a href="#fn_393"><font size="1">394</font></a>
  			  so that they could scarcely deign to give it a direct look. “So great,” says he, “was the splendor of the law, that the Jews could not endure it. What, then, must we think of the gospel, the dignity of which is as much superior to that of the law, as Christ is more excellent than Moses?”</p>

 <p><a name="ix.ii-p85"></a><b>10.</b> <i>What was rendered glorious.</i> This is not a correction of what goes before, but rather a confirmation; for he means that the glory of the law is extinguished when the gospel comes forth. As the moon and stars, though in themselves they are not merely luminous, but diffuse their light 			 over the whole earth, do, nevertheless, disappear before the brightness of the sun; so, however glorious the law was in itself, it has, nevertheless, no glory in comparison with the excellence of the gospel. Hence it follows, that we cannot sufficiently prize, or hold in sufficient esteem the glory of Christ, which shines forth in the gospel, like the splendor of the sun when beaming forth; and that the gospel is foolishly handled, nay more, is shamefully profaned, where the power and majesty 			 of the Spirit do not come forth to view, so as to draw up men’s minds and hearts heavenward.</p>  <a name="ix.iii"></a>

 <p><a name="ix.iii-p22"></a><b>12.</b> <i>Having therefore this hope.</i> Here he advances still farther, for he does not treat merely of the nature of the law, or of that enduring quality of which we have spoken, but also of its abuse. True, indeed, this also belonged to its nature, that, being covered with a veil, it was not 			 so manifest to the eye, and that by its brightness it inspired terror, and accordingly Paul says elsewhere, what amounts to the same thing — that the people of Israel had <i>received </i>from it the <i>spirit of bondage unto fear. </i>(<a name="ix.iii-p22.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015">Ro 8:15</a><a name="ix.iii-p22.1"></a>.) Here, however, he speaks rather of an abuse that was 			 foreign and adventitious.   			  <a name="fr_398"></a><a href="#fn_398"><font size="1">399</font></a>
  			  There was at that time in all quarters a grievous stumbling-block arising from the wantonness of the Jews, inasmuch as they obstinately rejected Christ.   			  <a name="fr_399"></a><a href="#fn_399"><font size="1">400</font></a>
  			  In consequence of this, weak consciences were shaken, being in doubt, whether they should embrace Christ, inasmuch as he was not acknowledged by the chosen people.   			  <a name="fr_400"></a><a href="#fn_400"><font size="1">401</font></a>
  			  This kind of scruple the Apostle removes, by instructing them, that their blindness had been prefigured even from the beginning, inasmuch as they could not behold the face of Moses, except through the medium of a <i>veil. </i>As, therefore, he had stated previously, that the law was rendered glorious by the lustre of Moses’ countenance, so now he teaches, that the <i>veil </i>was 			 an emblem of the blindness that was to come upon the people of Israel, for the person of Moses represents the law. The Jews, therefore, acknowledged by this, that they had not eyes to behold the law, except when veiled.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iii-p26"></a>This <i>veil, </i>he adds, is not taken away, except by Christ. From this he concludes, that none are susceptible of a right apprehension, but those who direct their minds to Christ.   			  <a name="fr_401"></a><a href="#fn_401"><font size="1">402</font></a>
  			  In the <i>first </i>place, he draws this distinction between the law and the Gospel — that the brightness of the former rather dazzled men’s eyes, than enlightened them, while in the latter, Christ’s glorious face is clearly beheld. He now triumphantly exults, on the ground that the majesty of the Gospel is not terrific, but amiable   			  <a name="fr_402"></a><a href="#fn_402"><font size="1">403</font></a>
  			  — is not hid, but is manifested familiarly to all. The term <a name="ix.iii-p28.2"></a>παῤῥησία <i>confidence, </i>he employs here, either as meaning an elevated magnanimity of spirit, with which all ministers of the Gospel ought to be endowed, or as denoting an open and full manifestation of Christ; and this second view is the more probable, for he contrasts this <i>confidence </i>with the obscurity of the law.   			  <a name="fr_403"></a><a href="#fn_403"><font size="1">404</font></a>

As, therefore, he could not renew the minds of the hearers, he was contented with faithfully discharging the duty assigned to him. Nay more, the Lord having commanded him to put a <i>veil </i>between his face and the eyes of the beholders, he obeyed. Nothing, therefore, is said here to the dishonor of Moses, for he was not required to do more than the commission, that was assigned to him, called for.

For the law is in itself bright, but it is only when Christ. appears to us in it, that we enjoy its splendor. The Jews turn away their eyes as much as they can from Christ. It is not therefore to be wondered, if they see 			 nothing, refusing as they do to behold the sun.

 <p><a name="ix.iii-p48"></a><b>17.</b> <i>The Lord is the Spirit.</i> This passage, also, has been misinterpreted, as if Paul had meant to say, that Christ is of a spiritual essence, for they connect it with that statement in <a name="ix.iii-p48.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#024">Joh 4:24</a><a name="ix.iii-p48.1"></a>, 			 <i>God is a Spirit</i>. The statement before us, however, has nothing to do with Christ’s essence, but simply points out his office, for it is connected with what goes before, where we found it stated, that the doctrine of the law is literal, and not merely dead, but even an occasion of death. He now, on the other hand, calls <i>Christ its spirit</i>,   			  <a name="fr_410"></a><a href="#fn_410"><font size="1">411</font></a>
  			  meaning by this, that it will be living and life-giving, only if it is breathed into by Christ. Let the soul be connected with the body, and then there is a living man, endowed with intelligence and perception, fit for all vital functions.   			  <a name="fr_411"></a><a href="#fn_411"><font size="1">412</font></a>
  			  Let the soul be removed from the body, and there will remain nothing but a useless carcase, totally devoid of feeling.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iii-p51"></a>The passage is deserving of particular notice,  			  <a name="fr_412"></a><a href="#fn_412"><font size="1">413</font></a>
  			 as teaching us, in what way we are to reconcile those encomiums which David pronounces upon the law — (<a name="ix.iii-p52.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#007">Ps. 19:7</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#008">8</a><a name="ix.iii-p52.2"></a>) — “the law of the Lord converteth souls, enlighteneth the eyes, imparteth wisdom to babes,” and passages of a like nature, with those statements of Paul, which at first view are at variance with them — that it is the ministry of sin and death — the letter that does 			 nothing but kill. (<a name="ix.iii-p52.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#006">2 Cor. 3:6</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#007">7</a><a name="ix.iii-p52.3"></a>.) For when it is animated by Christ,  			  <a name="fr_413"></a><a href="#fn_413"><font size="1">414</font></a>
  			 those things that David makes mention of are justly applicable to it. If Christ is taken away, it is altogether such as Paul describes. Hence Christ is the life of the law.  			  <a name="fr_414"></a><a href="#fn_414"><font size="1">415</font></a>
 </p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iii-p55"></a><i>Where the Spirit of the Lord.</i> He now describes the manner, in which Christ gives life to the law — by giving us his Spirit. The term Spirit here has a different signification from what it had in the preceding verse. There, it denoted the soul, and was ascribed metaphorically to Christ. Here, on the other hand, it means the Holy Spirit, that Christ himself 			 confers upon his people. Christ, however, by regenerating us, gives life to the law, and shows himself to be the fountain of life, as all vital functions proceed from man’s soul. Christ, then, is to all (so to speak) the universal soul, not in respect of essence, but in respect of grace. Or, if you prefer it, Christ is <i>the Spirit</i>, because he quickens us by the life-giving influence of his Spirit.   			  <a name="fr_415"></a><a href="#fn_415"><font size="1">416</font></a>
 </p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iii-p57"></a>He makes mention, also, of the blessing that we obtain from that source. “<i>There</i>,” says he, “<i>is liberty</i>.” By the term <i>liberty</i> I do not understand merely emancipation from 			 the servitude of sin, and of the flesh, but also that confidence, which we acquire from His bearing witness as to our adoption. For it is in accordance with that statement —</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="ix.iii-p58"></a>We have not again received the spirit of bondage, to fear, etc. (<a name="ix.iii-p58.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015">Ro 8:15</a><a name="ix.iii-p58.1"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iii-p59"></a>In that passage, the Apostle makes mention of two things — <i>bondage, </i>and <i>fear</i>. The opposites of these are <i>liberty </i>and <i>confidence. </i>Thus I acknowledge, that the 			 inference drawn from this passage by Augustine is correct — that we are by nature the slaves of sin, and are made free by the grace of regeneration. For, where there is nothing but the bare letter of the law, <i>there </i>will be only the dominion of sin, but the term <i>Liberty, </i>as I have said, I take in a more extensive sense. The grace of 			 the Spirit might, also, be restricted more particularly to ministers, so as to make this statement correspond with the commencement of the chapter, for ministers require to have another grace of the Spirit, and another liberty from what others have. The former signification, however, pleases me better, though at the same time I have no objection, that this should be applied to every one according to the measure of his gift. It is enough, if we observe, that Paul here points out the efficacy of 			 the Spirit, which we experience for our salvation — as many of us, as have been regenerated by his grace.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="ix.iii-p60"></a><a name="ix.iii-p60.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iii-p61"></a><b>18.</b> <i>But we all, with unveiled face</i>. I know not how it had come into the mind of Erasmus, to apply to ministers exclusively, what is evidently common to all believers. The word <a name="ix.iii-p61.1"></a>κατοπτριζεσθαι, it is true, has a 			 double signification among the Greeks, for it sometimes means to hold out a mirror to be looked into, and at other times to look into a mirror when presented.   			  <a name="fr_416"></a><a href="#fn_416"><font size="1">417</font></a>
  			  The old interpreter, however, has correctly judged, that the <i>second</i> of these is the more suitable to the passage before us. I have accordingly followed his rendering.   			  <a name="fr_417"></a><a href="#fn_417"><font size="1">418</font></a>
  			  Nor is it without good reason, that Paul has added a term of universality — “<i>We all</i>,” says he; for he takes in the whole body of the Church. It is a conclusion that suits well with the doctrine stated previously — that we have in the gospel a clear revelation from God. As to this, we shall see something farther in the <i>fourth</i> chapter.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iii-p64"></a>He points out, however, at the same time, both the strength of the revelation, and our daily progress.   			  <a name="fr_418"></a><a href="#fn_418"><font size="1">419</font></a>
  			  For he has employed such a similitude to denote <i>three </i>things: <i>first, </i>That we have no occasion to fear obscurity, when we approach the gospel, for God <i>there </i>clearly discovers to us His face;   			  <a name="fr_419"></a><a href="#fn_419"><font size="1">420</font></a>
  			  <i>secondly, </i>That it is not befitting, that it should be a dead contemplation, but that we should be transformed by means of it into the image of God; and, <i>thirdly, </i>that the one and the other are not accomplished in us in one moment, but we must be constantly making progress both in the knowledge of God, and in conformity to His image, for this is the meaning of the 			 expression — <i>from glory to glory</i></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iii-p67"></a>When he adds, — <i>as by the Spirit of the Lord, </i>he again reminds of what he had said — that the whole excellence of the gospel depends on this, that it is made life-giving to us by the grace of the Holy Spirit. For the particle of comparison — <i>as, </i>is not employed to convey the idea of something not strictly applicable, but to point out the manner. Observe, that the design of the gospel is this — that the image of God, which had been effaced by sin, may be stamped anew upon us, and that the advancement of this restoration may be continually going forward in us during our whole life, because God makes his glory shine forth in us by little and little.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.iii-p68"></a>There is one question that may be proposed here. “Paul says, that we behold God’s face with an unveiled face,  			  <a name="fr_420"></a><a href="#fn_420"><font size="1">421</font></a>
  			 while in the former Epistle we find it stated, that we do not, for the present, know God otherwise than through a mirror, and in an obscure manner.” In these statements there is an appearance of contrariety. They are, however, by no means at variance. The knowledge that we have of God for the present is obscure and slender, in comparison with the glorious view that we shall have on occasion of Christ’s last coming. At the same time, He presents Himself to us at present, so as to be 			 seen by us, and openly beheld, in so far as is for our advantage, and in so far as our capacity admits of.  			  <a name="fr_421"></a><a href="#fn_421"><font size="1">422</font></a>
  			 Hence Paul makes mention of progress being made, inasmuch as there will <i>then </i>only be perfection.</p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="ix.ii-p29"></a> Charnock, in his “Discourse on the Efficient of Regeneration,” makes an interesting allusion to Calvin’s exposition of this verse. “Thinking,” says he, “is the lowest step in the ladder of preparation; ‘tis the first act of the creature in any rational production; yet this the Apostle doth remove from man, as in every part of it his own act, (<a name="ix.ii-p29.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#005">2Co 3:5</a><a name="ix.ii-p29.1"></a>)</p>

 <p><a name="ix.ii-p31"></a>The word signifies — reasoning: no rational act can be done without reasoning; this is not purely our own. We have no sufficiency of ourselves, <i>as of ourselves</i>, originally and radically of ourselves, as if we were the author of that sufficiency, either naturally or meritoriously. And Calvin observes, that the word is not 				  <a name="ix.ii-p31.1"></a>αὐτάρκεια, but <a name="ix.ii-p31.2"></a>ἱκανότη” — not a <i>self ability</i>, but an <i>aptitude</i> or <i>fitness</i> to any gracious thought. How can we oblige him by any act, since, in every part of 				  it, it is from him, not from ourselves? For as <i>thinking</i> is the first requisite, so it is perpetually requisite to the progress of any rational act, so that every thought in any act, and the whole progress, wherein there must be a whole flood of thoughts, is from the sufficiency of God.” — <i>Charnock’s Works</i>, volume 2, p. 149. — <i>Ed.</i></p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="ix.ii-p54"></a> “Can you seriously think the Scriptures,” says Revelation Andrew Fuller, in his Thoughts on Preaching, “to be a book of riddles and conundrums, and that a Christian minister is properly employed in giving scope to his fancy in order to discover their solution? [...] All Scripture is profitable in some way, some for doctrine, some for reproof, some for correction, and some for instruction in righteousness, but all is not to be turned into allegory. 				  If we must <i>play</i>, let it be with things of less consequence than the word of the eternal God.” — <i>Fuller’s Works</i>, volume 4, p. 694. The attentive reader cannot fail to observe, how very frequently our author exposes, in the strongest terms, the exercise of mere fancy in the interpretation of the Holy Scriptures.

The word in this application is always rendered in our language <i>Testament</i>. We have in this followed the Vulgate, as most modern translators also have done. In the Geneva French, the word is rendered both ways in the title, that the one may serve in explaining the other. ‘<a name="ix.iii-p10.3"></a>Le Nouveau Testament, c’est à dire, La Nouvelle Alliance;’ — (‘The New Testament, that is to say, The New Covenant,’) in which they copied Beza, who says — ‘<a name="ix.iii-p10.4"></a>Testamentum Novum, sive Fœdus Novum;’ — (‘The New Testament, or the New Covenant.’) That the second rendering of the word is the better version, is unquestionable; but the title appropriated by custom to a particular book is on the same footing with a proper name, which is 						hardly considered as a subject for criticism.
