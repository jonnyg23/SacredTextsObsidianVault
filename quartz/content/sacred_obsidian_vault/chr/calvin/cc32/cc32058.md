 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lvii-p15"></a><b><a name="ii.lvii-p15.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#019">Matthew 17:19</a><a name="ii.lvii-p15.2"></a>.</b> <i>Then the disciples coming.</i> The disciples wonder that the power which they once possessed has been taken from them; but they had lost it by their own fault. Christ therefore attributes this want of ability to their unbelief, and repeats and 			 illustrates more largely the statement which he had previously made, that <i>nothing is impossible to faith</i>  It is a hyperbolical mode of expression, no doubt, when he declares that faith <i>removes trees and mountains; </i>but the meaning amounts to this, that God will never forsake us, if we keep the door open for receiving his grace. He does not mean 			 that God will give us every thing that we may mention, or that may strike our minds at random. On the contrary, as nothing is more at variance with faith than the foolish and irregular desires of our flesh, it follows that those in whom faith reigns do not desire every thing without discrimination, but only that which the Lord promises to give. Let us therefore maintain such moderation as to desire nothing beyond what he has promised to us, and to confine our prayers within that rule which he 			 has laid down.</p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lvii-p16"></a>But it may be objected, that the disciples did not know whether or not the Lord was pleased to cure the <i>lunatic</i>  It is easy to reply, that it was their own fault if they did not know; for Christ is now speaking expressly about special <i>faith</i>, which had its secret instincts, as the circumstances of the case required. And this is the <i>faith</i> of which Paul speaks, (<a name="ii.lvii-p16.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#009">1Co 12:9</a><a name="ii.lvii-p16.1"></a>.) How then came it that the apostles were deprived of the 			 power of the Spirit, which they had formerly exercised in working miracles, but because they had quenched it by their indolence? But what Christ said about special <i>faith</i>, in reference to this particular event, may be extended to the common <i>faith</i> of the whole Church.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.lvii-p17"></a><a name="ii.lvii-p17.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lvii-p18"></a><b>21.</b> <i>This kind goeth not out</i>,   			  <a name="fr_491"></a><a href="#fn_491"><font size="1">492</font></a>
  			  By this expression Christ reproved the negligence of certain persons, in order to inform them that it was not an ordinary <i>faith</i> which was required; for otherwise they might have replied that they were not altogether destitute of <i>faith</i> <i> 			 </i>The meaning therefore is, that it is not every kind of <i>faith</i> that will suffice, when we have to enter into a serious conflict with Satan, but that vigorous efforts are indispensably necessary. For the weakness of <i>faith</i> he prescribes 			 <i>prayer</i> as a remedy, to which he adds <i>fasting </i>by way of an auxiliary. “You are effeminate exorcist,” said he, “and seem as if you were engaged in a mock-battle got up for amusement;   			  <a name="fr_492"></a><a href="#fn_492"><font size="1">493</font></a>
  			  but you have to deal with a powerful adversary, who will not yield till the battle has been fought out. Your <i>faith </i>must therefore be excited by <i>prayer</i>, and as you are slow and languid in <i>prayer</i>, you must resort to <i>fasting</i> as an assistance.”   			  <a name="fr_493"></a><a href="#fn_493"><font size="1">494</font></a>
  			  Hence it is very evident how absurdly the Papists represent <i>fasting</i> to be the specific method of driving away devils, since our Lord refers to it for no other reason than to stimulate the earnestness of prayer. When he says that <i>this kind </i>of devils <i>cannot be cast out in any other way than by prayer and fasting,</i> he means that, when Satan has taken deep root in any one, and has been confirmed by long possession, or when he rages with unbridled fury, the victory is difficult and painful, and therefore the contest must be maintained with all our might.</p>
