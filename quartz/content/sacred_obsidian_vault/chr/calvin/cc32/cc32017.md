 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.xvi-p15"></a><b><a name="ii.xvi-p15.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#027">Luke 11:27</a><a name="ii.xvi-p15.2"></a>.</b> <i>Blessed is the womb.</i> By this eulogium the woman intended to magnify the excellence of Christ; for she had no reference to Mary,   			  <a name="fr_153"></a><a href="#fn_153"><font size="1">154</font></a>
  			  whom, perhaps, she had never seen. And yet it tends in a high degree to illustrate the glory of Christ, that she pronounces <i>the womb that bore him</i> to be noble and <i>blessed. </i>Nor was the blessing inappropriate, but in strict accordance with the manner of Scripture; for we know that offspring, and 			 particularly when endued with distinguished virtues, is declared to be a remarkable gift of God, preferable to all others. It cannot even be denied that God conferred the highest honor on Mary, by choosing and appointing her to be the mother of his Son. And yet Christ’s reply is so far from assenting to this female voice, that it contains an indirect reproof.</p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.xvi-p17"></a><i>Nay, rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God.</i> We see that Christ treats almost as a matter of indifference that point on which the woman had set a high value. And undoubtedly what she supposed to be Mary’s highest honor was far inferior to the other favors which she had received; for it was of vastly greater importance to be 			 regenerated by the Spirit of God than to conceive Christ, according to the flesh, in her womb; to have Christ living spiritually within her than to suckle him with her breasts. In a word, the highest happiness and glory of the holy Virgin consisted in her being a member of his Son, so that the heavenly Father reckoned her in the number of new creatures.</p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.xvi-p18"></a>In my opinion, however, it was for another reason, and with a view to another object, that Christ now corrected the saying of the woman. It was because men are commonly chargeable with neglecting even those gifts of God, on which they gaze with astonishment, and bestow the highest praise. This woman, in applauding Christ, had left out what was of the very highest consequence, that in him salvation is exhibited to all; and, therefore, it was a 			 feeble commendation, that made no mention of his grace and power, which is extended to all. Christ justly claims for himself another kind of praise, not that his mother alone is reckoned <i>blessed, </i>but that he brings to us all perfect and eternal happiness. We never form a just estimate of the excellence of Christ, till we consider for what purpose he was given to us by the Father, and perceive the benefits which he has brought to us, so that we who are wretched in ourselves may 			 become happy in him. But why does he say nothing about himself, and mention only the word of God? It is because in this way he opens to us all his treasures; for without the word he has no intercourse with <i>us, </i>nor we with him. Communicating himself to us by <i>the word, </i>he rightly and properly calls us to <i>hear and keep it, </i>that by faith he may become ours.</p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text22"><a name="ii.xvi-p19"></a>We now see the difference between Christ’s reply and the woman’s commendation; for the <i>blessedness, </i>which she had limited to his own relatives, is a favor which he offers freely to all. He shows that we ought to entertain no ordinary esteem for him, because he has all <i>the treasures </i>of life, <i>blessedness, </i>and glory, <i>hidden in him, </i>(<a name="ii.xvi-p19.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#003">Col 2:3</a><a name="ii.xvi-p19.1"></a>,) which he dispenses by the word, that they may be communicated to those who embrace <i>the word </i>by faith; for God’s free adoption of us, which we obtain by faith, is the key to the kingdom of heaven. The connection between the two things must also be observed. We must first <i>hear, </i>and then <i>keep; </i>for as <i>faith cometh by hearing, </i>(<a name="ii.xvi-p19.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#017">Ro 10:17</a><a name="ii.xvi-p19.2"></a>,) it is in this way that the 			 spiritual life must be commenced. Now as the simple hearing is like a transitory <i>looking into a mirror,</i>  			  <a name="fr_154"></a><a href="#fn_154"><font size="1">155</font></a>
  			  as James says, (1:23,) he likewise adds, <i>the keeping of the word, </i>which means the effectual reception of it, when it strikes its roots deep into our hearts, and yields its fruit. The forgetful hearer, whose ears alone are struck by the outward doctrine, gains no advantage. On the other hand, they who boast that they are satisfied with the secret inspiration, and on this ground disregard the outward preaching, shut themselves out from the heavenly life. What the Son of 			 God <i>hath joined let not men, </i>with wicked rashness, <i>put asunder, </i>(<a name="ii.xvi-p20.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#006">Mt 19:6</a><a name="ii.xvi-p20.2"></a>.) The Papists discover amazing stupidity by singing, in honor of Mary, those very words by which their superstition is expressly condemned, and who, in giving thanks, detach the woman’s saying, and leave out the correction.  			  <a name="fr_155"></a><a href="#fn_155"><font size="1">156</font></a>
  			 But it was proper that such a universal stupefaction should come upon those who intentionally profane, at their pleasure, the sacred word of God.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.xvi-p22"></a><a name="ii.xvi-p22.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.xvi-p23"></a><b><a name="ii.xvi-p23.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#019">Luke 8:19</a><a name="ii.xvi-p23.2"></a>.</b> <i>And his mother and his brethren came to him.</i> There is an apparent discrepancy here between Luke and the other two Evangelists; for, according to their arrangement of the narrative, they represent Christ’s mother and cousins as having come, while he 			 was discoursing about <i>the unclean spirit, </i>while he refers to a different occasion, and mentions only the woman’s exclamation, which we have just now explained. But we know that the Evangelists were not very exact as to the order of dates, or even in detailing minutely every thing that Christ did or said, so that the difficulty is soon removed. Luke does not state at what precise time Christ’s mother came to him; but what the other two 			 Evangelists relate before the parable of the sower he introduces after it. The account which he gives of the exclamation of the woman from among the multitude bears some resemblance to this narrative; for inconsiderate zeal may have led her to exalt to the highest pitch what she imagined that Christ had unduly lowered.</p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.xvi-p24"></a>All the three Evangelists agree in stating, that while Christ was discoursing in the midst of a crowd of people, his <i>mother and brethren came to him</i> The reason must have been either that they were anxious about him, or that they were desirous of instruction; for it is not without some good reason that they 			 endeavor to approach him, and it is not probable that those who accompanied the holy mother were unbelievers. Ambrose and Chrysostom accuse Mary of ambition, but without any probability. What necessity is there for such a conjecture, when the testimony of the Spirit everywhere bestows commendation on her distinguished piety and modesty? The warmth of natural affection may have carried them beyond the bounds of propriety: this I do not deny, but I have no doubt that they were led by pious zeal 			 to seek his society. Matthew relates that the message respecting their arrival was brought by <i>one </i>individual: Mark and Luke say that he was informed by many persons. But there is no inconsistency here; for the message which his mother sent to call him would be communicated, as usually happens, from one hand to another, till at length it reached him.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.xvi-p25"></a><a name="ii.xvi-p25.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.xvi-p26"></a><b><a name="ii.xvi-p26.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#048">Matthew 12:48</a><a name="ii.xvi-p26.2"></a>.</b> <i>Who is my mother?</i> These words were unquestionably intended to reprove Mary’s eagerness, and she certainly acted improperly in attempting to interrupt the progress of his discourse.   			  <a name="fr_156"></a><a href="#fn_156"><font size="1">157</font></a>
  			  At the same time, by disparaging the relationship of flesh and blood, our Lord teaches a very useful doctrine; for he admits all his disciples and all believers to the same honorable rank, as if they were his nearest relatives, or rather he places them in the room of his <i>mother and brethren</i> Now this statement is closely connected with the office of 			 Christ; for he tells us that he has been given, not to a small number of individuals, but to all the godly, who are united in one body with him by faith. He tells us also, that there is no tie of relationship more sacred than spiritual relationship, because we ought not to think of him according to the flesh, but according to the power of his Spirit which he has received from the Father to renew men, so that those who are by nature the polluted and accursed seed of Abraham begin to be by grace 			 the holy and heavenly sons of God. In like manner, Paul affirms that to <i>know Christ after the flesh </i>is not to know him properly, (<a name="ii.xvi-p27.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#016">2Co 5:16</a><a name="ii.xvi-p27.2"></a>,) because we ought rather to consider that renovation of the world, which far exceeds human power, and which takes place when he forms us anew by his Spirit to the image of God. To sum 			 up the whole, this passage, first, teaches us to behold Christ with the eyes of faith; and, secondly, it informs us, that every one who is regenerated by the Spirit, and gives himself up entirely to God for true justification, is thus admitted to the closest union with Christ, and becomes one with him.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ii.xvi-p28"></a><a name="ii.xvi-p28.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.xvi-p29"></a><b>50.</b> <i>For whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in heaven.</i> When he says that they <i>do the will of his Father,</i> he does not mean that they 			 fulfill, in a perfect manner, the whole righteousness of the law; for in that sense the name <i>brother, </i>which is here given by him to his disciples, would not apply to any man.   			  <a name="fr_157"></a><a href="#fn_157"><font size="1">158</font></a>
  			  But his design is, to bestow the highest commendation on faith, which is the source and origin of holy obedience, and at the same time covers the defects and sins of the flesh, that they may not be imputed. <i>This, </i>says Christ in a well-known passage,</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="ii.xvi-p31"></a>is the will of my Father, that whosoever seeth the Son, and believeth in him, may not perish, but have eternal life, <br> 			 (<a name="ii.xvi-p31.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#040">Joh 6:40</a><a name="ii.xvi-p31.2"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text22"><a name="ii.xvi-p32"></a>Although these words seem to imply that Christ has no regard to the ties of blood, yet we know that in reality he paid the strictest attention to human order,  			  <a name="fr_158"></a><a href="#fn_158"><font size="1">159</font></a>
  			 and discharged his lawful duties towards relatives; but points out that, in comparison of spiritual relationship, no regard, or very little, is due to the relationship of the flesh. Let us therefore attend to this comparison, so as to perform all that nature can justly claim, and, at the same time, not to be too strongly attached to flesh and blood. Again, as Christ bestows on the disciples of his Gospel the inestimable honor of being reckoned as his brethren, we must be held guilty 			 of the basest ingratitude, if we do not disregard all the desires of the flesh, and direct every effort towards this object.</p>
