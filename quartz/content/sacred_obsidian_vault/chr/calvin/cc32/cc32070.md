 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxix-p12"></a>This narrative is highly useful; for it shows that Christ receives not only those who, moved by holy desire and faith, freely approach to him, but those who are not yet of age to know how much they need his grace. Those <i>little children</i> have not yet any understanding to desire his 			 blessing; but when they are presented to him, he gently and kindly receives them, and dedicates them to the Father   			  <a name="fr_610"></a><a href="#fn_610"><font size="1">611</font></a>
  			  by a solemn act of blessing. We must observe the intention of those who present the children; for if there had not been a deep-rooted conviction in their minds, that the power of the Spirit was at his disposal, that he might pour it out on the people of God, it would have been unreasonable to present their children. There is no room, therefore, to doubt, that they ask for them a participation of his grace; and so, by way of amplification, Luke adds the particle 			 <i>also</i>; as if he had said that, after they had experienced the various ways in which he assisted adults, they formed an expectation likewise in regard to <i>children</i>, that, if he <i>laid hands on them</i>, they would not leave him without having received some of the gifts of the Spirit. The <i>laying on of hands</i> (as we have said on a former occasion) was an ancient and well known sign of <i>blessing</i>; and so 			 there is no reason to wonder, if they desire that Christ, while employing that solemn ceremony, should pray for the <i>children</i>  At the same time, as <i>the inferior are blessed by the better</i>, (<a name="ii.lxix-p13.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#007">Heb 7:7</a><a name="ii.lxix-p13.2"></a>,) they ascribe to him the power and honor of the highest Prophet.</p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxix-p14"></a><b><a name="ii.lxix-p14.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#013">Matthew 19:13</a><a name="ii.lxix-p14.1"></a>. </b><i>But the disciples rebuked them. </i>If a crown   			  <a name="fr_611"></a><a href="#fn_611"><font size="1">612</font></a>
  			  had been put on his head, they would have admitted it willingly, and with approbation; for they did not yet comprehend his actual office. But they reckon it unworthy of his character to receive <i>children</i>; and their error wanted not plausibility; for what has the highest Prophet and the Son of God to do with <i>infants? </i>But hence we learn, that they who judge of Christ 			 according to the feeling of their flesh are unfair judges; for they constantly deprive him of his peculiar excellencies, and, on the other hand, ascribe, under the appearance of honor, what does not at all belong to him. Hence arose an immense mass of superstitions, which presented to the world a fancied Christ.   			  <a name="fr_612"></a><a href="#fn_612"><font size="1">613</font></a>
  			  And therefore let us learn not to think of him otherwise than what himself teaches, and not to assign to him a character different from what he has received from the Father. We see what happened with Popery. They thought that they were conferring a great honor on Christ, if they bowed down before a small piece of bread; but in the sight of God it was an offensive abomination. Again, because they did not think it sufficiently honorable to him to perform the office of 			 an Advocate for us, they made for themselves innumerable intercessors; but in this way they deprived him of the honor of Mediator.</p>

 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxix-p18"></a><b>14. </b><i>Suffer children. </i>He declares that he wishes to receive <i>children</i>; and at length, <i>taking them in his arms,</i> he not 			 only embraces, but <i>blesses </i>them by the <i>laying on of hand; </i>from which we infer that his grace is extended even to those who are of that age. And no wonder; for since the whole race of Adam is shut up under the sentence of death, all from the least even to the greatest must perish, except those who are rescued by the only Redeemer. To exclude from the grace of redemption those who are of that age 			 would be too cruel; and therefore it is not without reason that we employ this passage as a shield against the Anabaptists. They refuse baptism to <i>infants</i>, because infants are incapable of understanding that mystery which is denoted by it. We, on the other hand, maintain that, since baptism is the pledge and figure of the forgiveness of sins, and likewise of adoption by God, it ought not to be 			 denied to <i>infants</i>, whom God adopts and washes with the blood of his Son. Their objection, that repentance and newness of life are also denoted by it, is easily answered. <i>Infants </i>are renewed by the Spirit of God, according to the capacity of their age, till that power which was concealed within them grows by degrees, and becomes fully manifest at 			 the proper time. Again, when they argue that there is no other way in which we are reconciled to God, and become heirs of adoption, than by faith, we admit this as to adults, but, with respect to <i>infants</i>, this passage demonstrates it to be false. Certainly, the <i>laying on of hands</i> was not a trifling or empty sign, and the prayers of Christ were not idly wasted in air. But he could not present the infants solemnly to God without giving them purity. And for what did he pray for them, but that they might be received into the number of the children of God? Hence it follows, that they were renewed by the Spirit to the hope of salvation. In short, by embracing them, he testified that they were reckoned by Christ among his flock. And if they were partakers of the 			 spiritual gifts, which are represented by Baptism, it is unreasonable that they should be deprived of the outward sign. But it is presumption and sacrilege to drive far from the fold of Christ those whom he cherishes in his bosom, and to shut the door, and exclude as strangers those whom he does not wish to be <i>forbidden to come to him</i></p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxix-p19"></a><i>For of such is the kingdom of heaven.</i> Under this term he includes both <i>little children </i>and those who resemble them; for the Anabaptists foolishly exclude children, with whom the subject must have commenced; but at the same time, taking occasion from the present occurrence, he intended 			 to exhort his disciples to lay aside malice and pride, and put on the nature of <i>children</i>  Accordingly, it is added by Mark and Luke, that no man <i>can enter into the kingdom of heaven </i>unless he be made to resemble a child. But we must attend to Paul’s admonition,</p>
