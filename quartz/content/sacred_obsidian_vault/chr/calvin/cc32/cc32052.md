 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.li-p7"></a>This miracle, which is omitted by the other two Evangelists, appears to have been related by Mark chiefly on account of this circumstance, that Christ <i>restored</i> sight to <i>the blind man</i>, not in an instant, as he was generally accustomed to do, but in a gradual manner. He did so most probably for the purpose of proving, in the case of this man, that he had full liberty as to his method of proceeding, and was not restricted to a fixed rule, so as not to resort to a variety of methods in exercising his power. On this account, he does not all at once enlighten the eyes of <i>the blind 			 man</i>, and fit them for performing their office, but communicates to them at first a dark and confused perception, and afterwards, by laying on his hands a second time, enables them to see perfectly. And so the grace of Christ, which had formerly been poured out suddenly on others, flowed by drops, as it were, on this man.</p>

The reply is, that he <i>sees men</i>, because he perceives some persons <i>walking </i>who are upright <i>like trees</i>  By these words he acknowledges that his sight is not yet so clear as to distinguish <i>men </i>from 			 <i>trees</i>, but that he has already obtained some power of seeing, because he conjectures from the motion that those whom he perceives to be in an erect posture are men; and it is in this respect that he says they are <i>like trees</i>  We see then that he speaks only by conjecture when he says that he 			 <i>sees men</i></p>

This is conjectured by some to have been done, because Christ intended to 			 punish the inhabitants of that place by depriving them of the enjoyment of his favor. Whatever might be the reason, it is certain that no miracle was performed by him in order to remain perpetually buried, but that he intended to have it concealed along with many others, till, after having expiated by his death the sins of the world,   			  <a name="fr_434"></a><a href="#fn_434"><font size="1">435</font></a>
