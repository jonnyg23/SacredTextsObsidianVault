Moreover, the name of God is transferred to idols, according to common parlance, and the corrupt opinion of the Gentiles; not that unbelievers thought that the Deity was included in the corruptible material, but because they imagined that it was nearer to them, if some earthly symbol of its presence were standing before their eyes. In this sense, they called the images of the gods their gods; because they thought they could not ascend to the heights in which the Deity 				dwelt, unless they mounted by these earthly aids. There is no doubt but that he comprehends by <i>synecdoche, </i>all kinds of images, when he forbids the making of molten gods; because metal is no more abominated by God than wood, or stone, or any other material, out of which idols are usually made; but, inasmuch as the insane zeal of superstition is the more inflamed by the value of the material or the beauty of the workmanship, Moses especially 				condemned molten gods. All question on this point is removed by the fourth passage here cited, wherein the Israelites are forbidden to make gods of silver or gold, viz., because idolaters indulge themselves more fully in their worship of very precious idols, by the external splendor of which all their senses are ravished. To the same effect is the third passage, in which mention is not, only made of graven images, but there is also added the name of a statue   				 <a name="fr_88"></a><a href="#fn_88"><font size="1">89</font></a>
  				 or figured stone; for, although some expound these words as referring to a pavement, yet I have no doubt but that all monuments are included in them, wherein foolish men think that they have God in some measure visible, and therefore that they express all sculptures and pictures by which the spiritual worship of God is corrupted. For the object of Moses is to restrain the rashness of men, lest they should travesty God’s glory by their imaginations; for another 				clause is immediately added, “I am the Lord your <i>God,</i>” in which God reminds them that He is despoiled of His due honor, whenever men devise anything earthly or carnal respecting Him. The word <a name="iii.iii.i-p25.2"></a>מצבה,   				 <a name="fr_89"></a><a href="#fn_89"><font size="1">90</font></a>
  				 <i>matsebah, </i>is sometimes used in a good sense; whence it follows, that no other statues are here condemned, except those which are erected as representations of God. The same also is the case as to the polished stone,   				 <a name="fr_90"></a><a href="#fn_90"><font size="1">91</font></a>
  				 viz., when it receives a consecration, which may attract men’s minds to regard it in a religious light, so as to worship God in the stone. But both in the second and third passages, Moses teaches men that as soon as they imagine anything gross or terrestrial in the deity, they altogether depart from the true God. And this is also expressed in the word <a name="iii.iii.i-p27.5"></a>אלילים, <i>elilim, </i>which embraces in it statues, stones, and graven images, as well as molten gods. Some think that this word is compounded of <a name="iii.iii.i-p27.6"></a>אל<i>,</i> <i>al</i>   				 <a name="fr_91"></a><a href="#fn_91"><font size="1">92</font></a>
  				 the negative particle, and <a name="iii.iii.i-p28.3"></a>אל, <i>el,</i> God. Others translate it “a thing of nought;” the Greeks and Latins have rendered it<i> “</i>idols.” It is plain, that the false representations, which travesty God, are so called to mark them with 				disgrace and ignominy. But, since the superstitious cease not to gloss over their errors with cavils, God is not content with this opprobrious name, but adds others also, respecting which their pretext was more specious; that we may know that whatsoever withdraws us from His spiritual service, or whatsoever men introduce alien from His nature, is repudiated by Him. In the fourth passage, the <i>antithesis </i>must be noted, which will presently be 				explained more fully, viz., when God forbids them to make gods of corruptible materials, since He has “spoken from heaven;” in which words He signifies that all are doing wrong, who, when they ought to look up to heaven, tie down their own minds as well as Him to earthly elements.</p>
