 <p><a name="iii.x.x-p29"></a><b>9.</b> <i>Command Aaron and his sons.</i> He more distinctly explains what might have appeared to be omitted; nor is it without reason that he carefully enters into these full details, for since God prefers obedience to all sacrifices, he was unwilling that anything should remain doubtful as 				to the external rites, which were not otherwise of great importance; that they might learn to observe precisely, and with the most exact care, whatever the Law commanded, and that they should not obtrude anything of themselves, inasmuch as the purity of the holy things was corrupted by the very smallest invention. He would, therefore, leave nothing to the people’s judgment, but directed them by a fixed rule even in the most trifling matters. As to the burnt-offerings, he commands that they 				should not be taken away from the altar till they were consumed by the fire; but after they were put on, he commands them to be burnt in a constant fire till the morrow. With this intent, he expressly says, that the fire should be kept alight on the altar all the night, since the sacrifices would not have been reduced to ashes without the application of fuel. <i>Secondly, </i>he commands the priest, clothed in the linen garment, and breeches, as he was 				wont to be in the performance of his sacred duties, to go to the altar, and to take away the ashes and put them by the side, or at some part of the altar; but when he shall have gone away from the altar, he bids him take off his holy garments, and carry the ashes out of the camp to a clean place. But what he had before briefly adverted to as to the supply of wood, he immediately declares more fully to be, lest the fire should go out. Again, he 				assigns to the priest the office of setting the wood in order every morning. But, because in the sacrifices   				 <a name="fr_274"></a><a href="#fn_274"><font size="1">275</font></a>
  				 of prosperities the Law commanded the fat only to be burnt, Moses now adds, verse 12, that the fat was to be burnt on the same fire. It is worthy of particular observation, that he finally subjoins a precept as to so keeping up the fire that it may never go out.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.x.x-p31"></a>The intent of this perpetuity was, that the offerings should be burnt with heavenly fire; for on the day that Aaron was consecrated, the sacrifice was reduced to ashes not by human means but miraculously, in token of approbation. True that God did not choose daily to exert this power; but He interposed the hand and labor of men in such a manner that the origin of the sacred fire should still be from heaven. The same thing afterwards 				happened at the dedication of Solomon’s temple, because that alteration of the divine decree demanded a sign (<i>tesseram,</i>) lest any should think that it was at the will of man that the splendor of the temple should outvie the tabernacle. Finally, the sacrifice of Elijah was graced by the same privilege when he restored the abolished legal service; and then also God upheld what He had ordained in His Law, in opposition to all corrupt and degenerate rites. Meanwhile, in order to 				prevent any adulterations, He chose to have the fire continually burning on the altar day and night, nor was it allowable to take it from elsewhere. There was, indeed, amongst the Persians  				 <a name="fr_275"></a><a href="#fn_275"><font size="1">276</font></a>
  				a perpetual fire, and at Rome also under the guardianship of the Vestal virgins;  				 <a name="fr_276"></a><a href="#fn_276"><font size="1">277</font></a>
  				and it may be, that in foolish mimicry they transferred to themselves the custom which they had heard of being observed by the Jews; for thus it is that, for the purpose of deceiving unbelievers, the devil often falsely makes a pretense of something divine, and imitates God just as an ape imitates man: but the purpose of God in rejecting strange fire was to retain the people in His own genuine ordinance prescribed by the Law, lest any inventions of men should insinuate 				themselves; for the prohibition of strange fire was tantamount to forbidding men to introduce anything of their own, or to add to the pure doctrine of the Law, or to decline from its rule. Meanwhile, since God had once testified, as if by stretching forth His hand from heaven (to receive them,  				 <a name="fr_277"></a><a href="#fn_277"><font size="1">278</font></a>
  				) that the sacrifices were acceptable to Him, believers were confirmed in their confidence of this by the pledge of the perpetual fire.</p>  			 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iii.x.x-p35"></a><a name="iii.x.x-p35.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.x.x-p36"></a><b>14.</b> <i>And this is the Law of the meat-offering.</i> We have already seen that there were various kinds of this offering; now, the cakes or wafers are omitted,   				 <a name="fr_278"></a><a href="#fn_278"><font size="1">279</font></a>
  				 and mention is only made of uncooked flour, whereof God commands that the priest should burn on the altar as much as his hand could hold. But this law was necessary in order that believers might be fully assured that God was propitiated by the due offering of this part, and that none might complain because the greater portion remained with the priests. Lest, however, the dignity of the sacrifice should be impaired, 				it was only permitted to the priests to make unleavened bread of it, which they were to eat in the sanctuary, as we have seen elsewhere. The meat-offering of the priests is excepted, which I conceive to be for two reasons, — first, that the excellency and dignity of their gift, honored as it was by special privilege, might stimulate the priests to greater efforts of piety, so as not to exercise themselves in God’s service in a common and perfunctory manner; secondly, that they might be thus 				restrained from the affectation of offering it too frequently. For if it only cost them a little flour, a door was opened to vain ostentation; they would have never ceased offering their   				 <a name="fr_279"></a><a href="#fn_279"><font size="1">280</font></a>
  				 <i>minha, </i>the profit of which returned to themselves; perhaps they might even have made a trade of it, as we see the Popish sacrificers entice the simple populace to profuse expenditure in offerings by the pomp of their fictitious devotion. Lest, therefore, they should cause their immoderate oblations to minister both to their vainglory and avarice, God willed that their meat-offering should be entirely 				consumed.</p>  			 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iii.x.x-p39"></a><a name="iii.x.x-p39.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.x.x-p40"></a><b>25.</b> <i>Speak unto Aaron.</i> We everywhere see how carefully God provided that the people should have no doubts about anything. And assuredly true religion is distinguished from false imaginations by this peculiar mark, that God Himself prescribes what is to be done. Nor can certainty, 				though religion ought to be based upon it, be derived elsewhere than from His own mouth. Now, because there was a difference between burnt-offerings and sin-offerings, it would have been natural to kill them separately in different, places, unless the error had been anticipated; but all doubt, is removed when God assigns the same place to them both. Whence, too, we gather that one law suffices for the proper worship of God, if men are not wise in their own conceits, but depend on His mouth. 				For how came it to pass that, whilst these two kinds of oblations differed from each other, the rule respecting them was the same on this point, except because it so pleased God? This passage, therefore, sufficiently reminds us with how great sober-mindedness and modesty it becomes us to follow what is pointed out to us in God’s word. A reason, however, is at the same time added, which may invite reverence to be paid to the sin-offerings, when 				especial sanctity is attributed to them, which, according to the idiom of the Hebrew language, is called “holiness of holinesses.” Moreover, Moses begins to distinguish between <a name="iii.x.x-p40.2"></a>חטאה, <i>chateah,</i>   				 <a name="fr_280"></a><a href="#fn_280"><font size="1">281</font></a>
  				 and <a name="iii.x.x-p41.2"></a>אשם, <i>asham, </i>which the Latins translate <i>peccatum, </i>and <i>delictum, </i>though he had before used them indifferently to express the same thing. What the difference was, I confess, I know 				not; I see the guesses of others, but nothing certain.</p>  			 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iii.x.x-p42"></a><a name="iii.x.x-p42.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.x.x-p43"></a><b>30.</b> <i>And no sin-offering.</i> The exception is repeated both with reference to the sacrifices mentioned in the fourth chapter, and also to the solemn sacrifice, whereby the priest and the people were reconciled every year: for private persons individually atoned for their sins at less 				expense, and only the greater altar, which stood in the court, was sprinkled with blood; but if the priest reconciled God to the whole people, or to himself, in order that the intercession might be more efficacious, he entered the sanctuary to pour out blood on the opposite side of the veil. God now again commands that such victims should be entirely burnt. This passage, then, is nothing but a confirmation of the others in which a like command is given. Hence the Apostle, in an apt allusion, 				infers that the distinction of meats is abolished; for he says that the minor altar, which under the Law was hidden, is now laid open to us, (<a name="iii.x.x-p43.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#010">Heb 13:10</a><a name="iii.x.x-p43.1"></a>,) and therefore we no longer eat of the legal sacrifices; yea, forasmuch as our One Priest has brought His blood into the sanctuary, it only remains for us to go forth with Him without the camp.</p>
