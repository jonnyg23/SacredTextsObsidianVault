 <p><a name="ix.xx-p6"></a><b>7.</b> <i>Then Herod, having secretly called the Magi</i> The tyrant did not dare to avow his fear and uneasiness, lest he might give fresh courage to a people, by whom he knew that he was hated. In public, therefore, he pretends that this matter does not concern him, but <i>inquires secretly, </i>in order to meet immediate danger. Though a bad conscience made him timid, there can be no doubt that God struck his mind with an unusual fear, which for a time made him incapable of reflection, and almost deprived him of the use of reason. For nothing was more easy than to send one of his courtiers as an escort, under the pretense of courtesy, who would investigate the whole 			 matter, and immediately return. Herod certainly was a man of no ordinary address, and of great courage. It is the more surprising that, in a case of extremity, and when the remedy is at hand, he remains in a state of amazement, and almost dead. Let us learn, that a miracle was effected, in rescuing the Son of God from the jaws of the lion. Not less at the present day does God infatuate his enemies, so that a thousand schemes of injuring and ruining his Church do not occur to their minds, and 			 even the opportunities which are at hand are not embraced. The trick which Herod practiced on the <i>Magi, </i>by pretending that he also would come for the purpose of worshipping Christ, was avoided by the Lord, as we shall see, in another way. But as Herod’s dread of arousing the people against him deprived him of the use of his reason, so again he is driven by such madness, that he does 			 not hesitate or shudder at the thought of provoking God. For he knew that, if a King were born, it was ordained by God, that he should raise up the throne “of David, which was fallen,” (<a name="ix.xx-p6.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#011">Am 9:11</a><a name="ix.xx-p6.1"></a>.) He does not therefore attack men, but furiously dares to fight with God. Two things claim our attention. He was seized with a spirit of giddiness, to attack God; and, on the other hand, his manner 			 of acting was childish: for his design was frustrated, so that he was like a “blind man groping in darkness.”   			  <a name="fr_184"></a><a href="#fn_184"><font size="1">185</font></a>

 <p><a name="ix.xx-p9"></a><b>9.</b> <i>But they, having heard the King, departed</i> It is truly an instance of base sluggishness, that not one of the Jews offers himself as an escort to those foreigners, to go and see the King who had been promised to their own nation. The scribes show them the way, and point out the place 			 where he was born; but they allow them to depart alone: not one moves a step. They were afraid, perhaps, of Herod’s cruelty: but it displayed wicked ingratitude that, for the sake of the salvation which had been offered to them, they were unwilling to undergo any risk, and cared less about the grace of God than about the frown of a tyrant. The whole nation, I have lately showed, was so degenerate, that they chose rather to be oppressed with the yoke of tyranny, than to submit to any 			 inconvenience arising from a change. If God had not fortified the minds of the Magi by his Spirit, they might have been discouraged by this state of things. But the ardor of their zeal is unabated; they set out without a guide. And yet the means of confirming their faith are not wanting; for they hear that the King, who had been pointed out to them by a star, was long ago described, in glowing language, by divine predictions. It would seem that the star, which hitherto guided them in the way, 			 had lately disappeared. The reason may easily be <i>conjectured. </i>It was, that they might make inquiry in Jerusalem about the new King, and might thus take away all excuse from the Jews, who, after having been instructed about the Redeemer who was sent to them, knowingly and willingly despise him.</p>

 <p><a name="ix.xx-p11"></a><b>11.</b> <i>They found the young child</i> So revolting a sight might naturally have created an additional prejudice; for Christ was so far from having aught of royalty surrounding him, that he was in a meaner and more despised condition than any peasant child. But they are convinced that he is 			 divinely appointed to be a King. This thought alone, deeply rooted in their minds, procures their reverence. They contemplate in the purpose of God his exalted rank, which is still concealed from outward view.   			  <a name="fr_185"></a><a href="#fn_185"><font size="1">186</font></a>
  			  Holding it for certain, that he will one day be different from what he now appears, they are not at all ashamed to render to him the honors of royalty.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xx-p13"></a>Their presents show whence they came: for there can be no doubt that they brought them as the choicest productions of their country. We are not to understand, that each of them presented his own offering, but that the three offerings, which are mentioned by Matthew, were presented by all of them in common. Almost all the commentators indulge in speculations about those gifts, as denoting the kingdom, priesthood, and burial of 			 Christ. They make <i>gold</i> the symbol of his <i>kingdom,</i> — <i>frankincense, </i>of his <i>priesthoods</i>, — and 			 <i>myrrh, </i>of his <i>burial</i>. I see no solid ground for such an opinion. It was customary, we know, among the Persians, when they offered homage to their kings, to bring a present in their hands. The Magi select those three for the produce of which Eastern countries are celebrated; just as Jacob sent into Egypt the choicest and most 			 esteemed productions of the soil.</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="ix.xx-p14"></a>“Take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices and myrrh, nuts and almonds,” <br> 			 (<a name="ix.xx-p14.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#011">Ge 43:11</a><a name="ix.xx-p14.2"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xx-p15"></a>Again, in rendering homage, according to the custom of Persia, to him whom they still regarded as an earthly King, they offered the productions of the soil. Our duty is, to adore him in a spiritual manner: for the lawful and reasonable worship which he demands is, that we consecrate first ourselves, and then all that we have, to his service.</p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="ix.xx-p7"></a> Like many others of his scriptural allusions, this is not marked by our Author. It approaches very nearly to the language of one of the curses pronounced by Moses on the people of Israel, “If they should not hearken unto the voice of the Lord their God;” — “thou shalt grope at noon-day as <i>the blind gropeth in darkness,” </i>(<a name="ix.xx-p7.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#015">Deut. 28:15</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#029">29</a><a name="ix.xx-p7.1"></a>.) But it is more likely that he had in his eye a passage from the book of Job. In the opening description of “the devices of the crafty,” <i>Herod, </i>who is pronounced by Calvin to have been “a man of no ordinary address, and another <i>Herod, </i>whom our Lord 				  designates <i>that fox, </i>(<a name="ix.xx-p7.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#032">Lu 13:32</a><a name="ix.xx-p7.2"></a>,) are so exactly delineated, that it might almost be imagined they had sat for the picture. He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise. He taketh the wise in their own craftiness; and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong. <i>They meet with darkness in the day-time, and grope in the noon-day as in the night,” </i>(<a name="ix.xx-p7.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#012">Job 5:12-14</a><a name="ix.xx-p7.3"></a>.) — <i>Ed.</i></p>
