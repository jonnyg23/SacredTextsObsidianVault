Christ therefore bids him take care lest, by fear or distrust, he shut out that grace, to which death will be no hindrance. By this 			 expression, <i>only believe, </i>he means that he will not want power, provided Jairus will allow him; and, at the same time, exhorts him to enlarge his heart with confidence, because there is no room to fear that his faith will be more extensive than the boundless power of God. And truly this is the case with us all: for God would be much more liberal in his communications to us, if we were not so close; but our own scanty desires hinder him from 			 pouring out his gifts upon us in greater abundance.   			  <a name="fr_527"></a><a href="#fn_527"><font size="1">528</font></a>
  			  In general, we are taught by this passage, that we cannot go beyond bounds in believing: because our faith, however large, will never embrace the hundredth part of the divine goodness.</p>

 <p><a name="ix.lxxviii-p13"></a><b>37. </b><i>And did not permit any one to follow him.</i> He forbade that they should be allowed to enter, either because they were unworthy to be his witnesses of the miracle, or because he did not choose that the miracle should be overpowered by a noisy crowd around him. It was better 			 that the young woman, whose dead body they had beheld, should suddenly go out before the eyes of men, alive and full of rigor. <i>Mark</i> and <i>Luke</i> tell us that not more than three of the disciples were admitted, and both mention also the parents. <i>Mark</i> alone states that those who 			 had accompanied Jairus when he came to supplicate Christ were admitted. Matthew, who is more concise, takes no notice of this circumstance.</p>

 <p><a name="ix.lxxviii-p15"></a><b><a name="ix.lxxviii-p15.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#052">Luke 8:52</a><a name="ix.lxxviii-p15.2"></a>.</b> <i>And all were weeping.</i> The Evangelists mention the lamentation, that the resurrection may be more fully believed. <i>Matthew</i> expressly states that <i>musicians </i>were present, which was not usually the case till the death had been ascertained, and while the preparations for the funeral were going forward. The flute, he tells us, was heard in plaintive airs. Now, though their intention was to bestow this sort of honor on their dead, and as it were to adorn their grave, we see how strongly inclined the world is not only to indulge but to promote its faults. It was their duty to employ every method for 			 allaying grief; but as if they had not sinned enough in disorderly lamentation, they are eager to heighten it by fresh excitements. The Gentiles even thought that this was a way of soothing departed spirits; and hence we see how many corruptions were at that time spread throughout Judea.   			  <a name="fr_528"></a><a href="#fn_528"><font size="1">529</font></a>

Sleep </i>is everywhere in Scripture employed to denote <i>death; </i>and there is no doubt but this comparison, taken from temporal rest, points out a future resurrection. But here 			 Christ expressly makes a distinction between <i>sleep </i>and <i>death, </i>so as to excite an expectation of life. His meaning is, “You will presently see her raised up whom you suppose to be dead.” That he was <i>ridiculed </i>by thoughtless and ignorant people, who were wholly engrossed with profane lamentation, and who did not comprehend his design, ought not to 			 awaken surprise. And yet this very circumstance was an additional confirmation of the miracle, that those persons entertained no doubt whatever as to her death.</p>

It is easy to learn from this the great efficacy of the voice of Christ, which reaches even to the dead, and exerts a quickening influence on death itself. Accordingly, Luke says that 			 <i>her spirit returned, </i>or, in other words, that immediately on being called, it obeyed the command of Christ.</p>

 <p><a name="ix.lxxviii-p22"></a><b>43. </b><i>And he charged them</i>  Though Christ did not admit all indiscriminately to behold this resurrection, yet the miracle might not have remained long concealed. And it would indeed have been improper to suppress that power of God, by which the whole 			 world ought to be prepared for life. Why then does he enjoin silence on the young woman’s parents? Perhaps it was not so much about the fact itself, as about the manner of it, that he wished them to be silent, and that only for a time; for we see that there were other instances in which he sought out a proper occasion. Those who think that they were forbidden to speak for the purpose of whetting their desire, resort to a solution which is unnatural. I do acknowledge that Christ did not perform 			 this miracle without the intention of making it known, but perhaps at a more fitting time, or after the dismission of a crowd among whom there was no prudence or moderation. He therefore intended to allow some delay, that they might in quietness and composure revolve the work of God.</p>
