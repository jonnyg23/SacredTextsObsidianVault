 <p><a name="ix.xxxi-p12"></a><a name="ix.xxxi-p12.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xxxi-p13"></a><b><a name="ix.xxxi-p13.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001">Matthew 4:1</a><a name="ix.xxxi-p13.2"></a>.</b> <i>Then Jesus was led.</i> There were two reasons why Christ withdrew into the wilderness. The first was, that, after a fast of forty days, he might come forth as a new man, or rather a heavenly man, to the discharge of his office. The next was, that he 			 might be tried by temptation and undergo an apprenticeship, before he undertook an office so arduous, and so elevated. Let us therefore learn that, by the guidance of the Spirit, Christ withdrew from the crowd of men, in order that he might come forth as the highest teacher of the church, as the ambassador of God, — rather as sent from heaven, than as taken from some town, and from among the common people.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xxxi-p14"></a>In the same way Moses, when God was about to employ him as his agent in publishing his law, was carried into Mount Sinai, withdrawn from the view of the people, and admitted, as it were, into a heavenly sanctuary, (<a name="ix.xxxi-p14.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#012">Ex 24:12</a><a name="ix.xxxi-p14.1"></a>.) It was proper that Christ should be surrounded by marks of divine grace and power — at least equally illustrious with those which 			 were bestowed on Moses, that the majesty of the Gospel might not be inferior to that of the Law. If God bestowed singular honor on a doctrine which was “the ministration of death,” (<a name="ix.xxxi-p14.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#007">2Co 3:7</a><a name="ix.xxxi-p14.2"></a>,) how much more honor is due to the doctrine of life? And if a shadowy portrait of God had so much brightness, ought not his face, which appears in the Gospel, to shine with full splendor?</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xxxi-p15"></a>Such also was the design of the <i>fasting: </i>for Christ abstained from eating and drinking, not to give an example of temperance, but to acquire greater authority, by being separated from the ordinary condition of men, and coming forth, as an angel from heaven, not as a man from the earth. For what, pray, would have been that virtue of abstinence, in not 			 tasting food, for which he had no more appetite than if he had not been clothed with flesh?   			  <a name="fr_303"></a><a href="#fn_303"><font size="1">304</font></a>
  			  It is mere folly, therefore, to appoint a forty days’ fast, (as it is called,) in imitation of Christ. There is no more reason why we should follow the example of Christ in this matter, than there formerly was for the holy Prophets, and other Fathers under the law, to imitate the fast of Moses. But we are aware, that none of them thought of doing so; with the single exception of Elijah, who was employed by God in restoring the law, and who, 			 for nearly the same reason with Moses, was kept in the mount fasting.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xxxi-p17"></a>Those who fast daily, during all the forty days, pretend that they are imitators of Christ. But how? They stuff their belly so completely at dinner, that, when the hour of supper arrives, they have no difficulty in abstaining from food. What resemblance do they bear to the Son of God? The ancients practiced greater moderation: but even they had nothing that approached to Christ’s <i>fasting, 			 </i>any more, in fact, than the abstinence of men approaches to the condition of angels, who do not eat at all. Besides, neither Christ nor Moses observed a solemn fast every year; but both of them observed it only once during their whole life. I wish we could say that they had only amused themselves, like apes, by such fooleries. It was a wicked and abominable mockery of Christ, to attempt, by this contrivance of fasting, to conform themselves to him as their 			 model.   			  <a name="fr_304"></a><a href="#fn_304"><font size="1">305</font></a>
  			  To believe that such fasting is a meritorious work, and that it is a part of godliness and of the worship of God, is a very base superstition.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xxxi-p19"></a>But above all, it is an intolerable outrage on God, whose extraordinary miracle they throw into the shade; secondly, on Christ, whose distinctive badge they steal from him, that they may clothe themselves with his spoils; thirdly, on the Gospel, which loses not a little of its authority, if this <i>fasting </i>of Christ is not acknowledged to be his seal. God exhibited a singular 			 miracle, when he relieved his Son from the necessity of eating and when they attempt the same thing by their own power, what is it but a mad and daring ambition to be equal with God? Christ’s <i>fasting </i>was a distinctive badge of the divine glory: and is it not to defraud him of his glory, and to reduce him to the ordinary rank of men, when mortals freely mix themselves with him as his companions? God appointed Christ’s fasting to seal the Gospel: 			 and do those who apply it to a different purpose abate nothing from the dignity of the Gospel? Away, then, with that ridiculous imitation,   			  <a name="fr_305"></a><a href="#fn_305"><font size="1">306</font></a>
  			  which overturns the purpose of God, and the whole order of his works. Let it be observed, that I do not speak of <i>fastings </i>in general, the practice of which I could wish were more general among us, provided it were pure.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xxxi-p21"></a>But I must explain what was the object of Christ’s <i>fasting. </i>Satan availed himself of our Lord’s hunger as an occasion for tempting him, as will shortly be more fully stated. For the present, we must inquire generally, why was it the will of God that his Son should be tempted? That he was brought into this contest by a fixed purpose of God, is evident from the words of <i>Matthew</i> and <i>Mark, </i>who say, that for 			 this reason <i>he was led by the Spirit into the wilderness. </i>God intended, I have no doubt, to exhibit in the person of his Son, as in a very bright mirror, how obstinately and perseveringly Satan opposes the salvation of men. For how comes it, that he attacks Christ more furiously, and directs all his power and forces against him, at the particular time mentioned by the Evangelists, but because he sees him preparing, at the command of the Father, to undertake the redemption of men? Our 			 salvation, therefore, was attacked in the person of Christ, just as the ministers, whom Christ has authorized to proclaim his redemption, are the objects of Satan’s daily warfare.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xxxi-p22"></a>It ought to be observed, at the same time, that the Son of God voluntarily endured the temptations, which we are now considering, and fought, as it were, in single combat with the devil, that, by his victory, he might obtain a triumph for us. Whenever we are called to encounter Satan, let us remember, that his attacks can, in no other way, be sustained and repelled, than by holding out this shield: for the Son of God undoubtedly allowed 			 himself to be tempted, that he may be constantly before our minds, when Satan excites within us any contest of temptations. When he was leading a private life at home, we do not read that he was tempted; but when he was about to discharge the office of Redeemer, he then entered the field in the name of his whole church. But if Christ was tempted as the public representative of all believers, let us learn, that the temptations which befall us are not accidental, or regulated by the will of 			 Satan, without God’s permission; but that the Spirit of God presides over our contests as an exercise of our faith. This will aid us in cherishing the assured hope, that God, who is the supreme judge and disposer of the combat,  			  <a name="fr_306"></a><a href="#fn_306"><font size="1">307</font></a>
  			  will not be unmindful of us, but will fortify us against those distresses, which he sees that we are unable to meet.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xxxi-p24"></a>There is a slight apparent difference in the words of Luke, that <i>Jesus, full of the Holy Ghost, withdrew from Jordan</i> They imply, that he was then more abundantly endued with the grace and power of the Spirit, in order that he might be more fortified for the battles which he had to fight: for it was not 			 without a good reason that <i>the Holy Spirit descended upon him </i>in a visible shape. It has been already stated, that the grace of God shone in him the more brightly, as the necessity arising out of our salvation became greater.   			  <a name="fr_307"></a><a href="#fn_307"><font size="1">308</font></a>
  			  But, at first sight, it appears strange, that Christ was liable to the temptations of the devil: for, when temptation falls on men, it must always be owing to sin and weakness. I reply: First, Christ took upon him <i>our infirmity, but without sin,</i> (<a name="ix.xxxi-p25.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#015">Heb 4:15</a><a name="ix.xxxi-p25.2"></a>.) Secondly, it detracts no more from his glory, that he was exposed to temptations, than that he was clothed with our flesh: for he was made man on the condition that, along with our flesh, he should take upon him our feelings. But the whole difficulty lies in the first point. How was Christ surrounded by our weakness, so as to be capable of being tempted by Satan, and yet to be pure and free from all sin? The solution will not be difficult, if we recollect, that the nature of 			 Adam, while it was still innocent, and reflected the brightness of the divine image, — was liable to temptations. All the bodily affections, that exist in man, are so many opportunities which Satan seizes to tempt him.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xxxi-p26"></a>It is justly reckoned a weakness of human nature, that our senses are affected by external objects. But this weakness would not be sinful, were it not for the presence of corruption; in consequence of which Satan never attacks us, without doing some injury, or, at least, without inflicting a slight wound. Christ was separated from us, in this respect, by the perfection of his nature; though we must not imagine him to have existed in that 			 intermediate condition, which belonged to Adam, to whom it was only granted, that it was possible for him not to sin. We know, that Christ was fortified by the Spirit with such power, that the darts of Satan could not pierce him.  			  <a name="fr_308"></a><a href="#fn_308"><font size="1">309</font></a>

 <p><a name="ix.xxxi-p29"></a><b><a name="ix.xxxi-p29.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#003">Matthew 4:3</a><a name="ix.xxxi-p29.1"></a>.</b> <i>And when he, who tempteth, had approached to him.</i> This name, <a name="ix.xxxi-p29.2"></a>ὁ πειράζων, <i>the tempter, </i>is given to Satan by the Spirit for 			 the express purpose, that believers may be more carefully on their guard against him. Hence, too, we conclude, that temptations, which solicit us to what is evil, come from him alone: for, when God is sometimes said to <i>tempt </i>or <i>prove, </i>(<a name="ix.xxxi-p29.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#001">Ge 22:1</a><a name="ix.xxxi-p29.3"></a>; <a name="ix.xxxi-p29.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#003">De 13:3</a><a name="ix.xxxi-p29.4"></a>,) it is for a different purpose, namely, to try their faith, or to inflict punishment on unbelievers, or to discover the hypocrisy of those who do not sincerely obey the truth.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xxxi-p30"></a><i>That these stones may become loaves.</i> Here the ancients amused themselves with ingenious trifles. The first temptation, they said, was to gluttony; the second, to ambition; and the third, to covetousness. But it is absurd to suppose that it arises from the intemperance of 			 gluttony,   			  <a name="fr_309"></a><a href="#fn_309"><font size="1">310</font></a>
  			  when a hungry person desires food to satisfy nature. What luxury will they fancy themselves to have discovered in the use of bread, that one who satisfies himself, as we say, with dry bread, must be reckoned an epicure? But not to waste more words on that point, Christ’s answer alone is sufficient to show, that the design of Satan was altogether different. The Son of God was not such an unskillful or inexperienced antagonist, as not to know 			 how he might ward off the strokes of his adversary, or idly to present his shield on the left hand when he was attacked on the right. If Satan had endeavored to allure him by the enticements of gluttony,   			  <a name="fr_310"></a><a href="#fn_310"><font size="1">311</font></a>
  			  he had at hand passages of Scripture fitted to repel him. But he proposes nothing of this sort.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xxxi-p33"></a><a name="ix.xxxi-p33.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xxxi-p34"></a><b>4. </b><i>Man shall not live by bread alone.</i> He quotes the statement, that men <i>do not live by bread alone, </i>but by the secret blessing of God. Hence we conclude, that Satan made a direct attack on the faith of Christ, in the hope that, after destroying his faith, he 			 would drive Christ to unlawful and wicked methods of procuring food. And certainly he presses us very hard, when he attempts to make us distrust God, and consult our own advantage in a way not authorized by his word. The meaning of the words, therefore, is: “When you see that you are forsaken by God, you are driven by necessity to attend to yourself. Provide then for yourself the food, with which God does not supply you.” Now, though   			  <a name="fr_311"></a><a href="#fn_311"><font size="1">312</font></a>
  			  he holds out the divine power of Christ to turn the <i>stones </i>into <i>loaves, </i>yet the single object which he has in view, is to persuade Christ to depart from the word of God, and to follow the dictates of infidelity.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xxxi-p36"></a>Christ’s reply, therefore, is appropriate: <i>“Man shall not live by bread alone. </i>You advise me to contrive some remedy, for obtaining relief in a different manner from what God permits. This would be to distrust God; and I have no reason to expect that he will support me in a different manner from what he has promised in his word. You, Satan, represent his favor as confined to <i>bread: </i>but Himself declares, that, though every kind 			 of food were wanting, his blessing alone is sufficient for our nourishment.” Such was the kind of temptation which Satan employed, the same kind with which he assails us daily. The Son of God did not choose to undertake any contest of an unusual description, but to sustain assaults in common with us, that we might be furnished with the same armor, and might entertain no doubt as to achieving the victory.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xxxi-p37"></a><i>It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone.</i> The first thing to be observed here is, that Christ uses Scripture as his shield: for this is the true way of fighting, if we wish to make ourselves sure of the victory. With good reason does Paul say, that, the sword of the Spirit is the word of God,” and enjoin us to <i>“</i>take the shield of faiths” (<a name="ix.xxxi-p37.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#016">Eph. 6:16</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#017">17</a><a name="ix.xxxi-p37.1"></a>.) Hence also we conclude, that Papists, as if they had made a bargain with Satan, cruelly give up souls to be destroyed by him at his pleasure, when they wickedly withhold the Scripture from the people of God, and thus deprive 			 them of their arms, by which alone their safety could be preserved. Those who voluntarily throw away that armor, and do not laboriously exercise themselves in the school of God, deserve to be strangled, at every instant, by Satan, into whose hands they give themselves up unarmed. No other reason can be assigned, why the fury of Satan meets with so little resistance, and why so many are everywhere carried away by him, but that God punishes their carelessness, and their contempt of his 			 word.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xxxi-p38"></a>We must now examine more closely the passage, which is quoted by Christ from Moses: <i>that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord doth man live,</i> (<a name="ix.xxxi-p38.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#003">De 8:3</a><a name="ix.xxxi-p38.1"></a>.) There are some who torture it to a false meaning, as referring to spiritual life; as if our Lord had 			 said, that souls are not nourished by visible <i>bread, but by the word of God. </i>The statement itself is, no doubt, true: but Moses had quite a different meaning. He reminds them that, when no bread could be obtained, God provided them with an extraordinary kind of nourishment in “manna, which they knew not, neither did their fathers know,” (<a name="ix.xxxi-p38.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#003">De 8:3</a><a name="ix.xxxi-p38.2"></a>;) and that this was intended as an evident proof, 			 in all time coming, that the life of man is not confined to <i>bread, </i>but depends on the will and good-pleasure of God. <i>The word </i>does not mean <i>doctrine, </i>but the purpose which God has made known, with regard to preserving the order of nature and the lives of his creatures. Having created men, he does not cease to care for them: but, as “he breathed into their nostrils the breath of life,” (<a name="ix.xxxi-p38.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007">Ge 2:7</a><a name="ix.xxxi-p38.3"></a>,) so he constantly preserves the life which he has bestowed. In like manner, the Apostle says, that he “upholdeth all things by his powerful word,” (<a name="ix.xxxi-p38.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003">Heb 1:3</a><a name="ix.xxxi-p38.4"></a>;) that is, the whole world is preserved, and every part of it keeps its place, by the will and decree of Him, whose power, above and below, is everywhere diffused. Though we live on <i>bread, </i>we must not ascribe the support of life to 			 the power of <i>bread, </i>but to the secret kindness, by which God imparts to bread the quality of nourishing our bodies.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.xxxi-p39"></a>Hence, also, follows another statement: <i>by</i> <i>every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God shall men live. </i>God, who now employs bread for our support, will enable us, whenever he pleases, to live by other means. This declaration of Moses condemns the stupidity of those, who reckon life to consist in luxury and abundance; while it reproves the distrust and inordinate anxiety which drives us to seek unlawful means. The precise 			 object of Christ’s reply is this: We ought to trust in God for food, and for the other necessaries of the present life, in such a manner, that none of us may overleap the boundaries which he has prescribed. But if Christ did not consider himself to be at liberty to change <i>stones </i>into <i>bread, </i>without the command of God, much less is it lawful for us to procure food by fraud, or robbery, or violence, or murder.</p>

Parquoy apprenons a ne nous lasser jamais, jusqu'a ce qu' ayans paracheve tout le cours de notre guerre, nous soyons parvenus au but.” — “The same St Luke, as well as St Mark, informs us, that the commencement of the 				  temptations was more distant. For Satan had attacked Christ forty days before he was hungry: but the most important and valuable combats are here related, in order that we may know that Satan, vanquished in many assaults, had fallen upon him furiously, and with all his might, to see if perhaps he might finally vanquish him, with whom he had not been able to succeed. For the more that we are exercised in spiritual combats, God allows us to be the more violently attacked. Wherefore let us learn, 				  never to become weary, till, having finished the whole course of our war, we have reached the end.”</p>
