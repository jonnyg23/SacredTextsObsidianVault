 <p><a name="ix.vi-p6"></a><b>26.</b> <i>Now in the sixth month</i> It was a wonderful dispensation of the divine purpose, and far removed from the ordinary judgment of men, that God determined to make the beginning of the generation of the herald more illustrious than that of his own Son. The prophecy respecting John was 			 published in the temple and universally known: Christ is promised to a virgin in an obscure town of Judea, and this prophecy remains buried in the breast of a young woman. But it was proper that, even from the birth of Christ, that saying should be fulfilled,</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="ix.vi-p7"></a><i>“</i>it pleased God by foolishness to save them that believe,” <br> 			 (<a name="ix.vi-p7.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#021">1Co 1:21</a><a name="ix.vi-p7.2"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.vi-p8"></a>The treasure of this mystery was committed by him to a virgin in such a manner, that at length, when the proper time came, it might be communicated to all the godly. It was, I own, a mean kind of guardianship; but whether for trying the humility of faith, or restraining the pride of the ungodly, it was the best adapted. Let us learn, even when the reason does not immediately appear, to submit modestly to God, and let us not be 			 ashamed to receive instruction from her who carried in her womb Christ the eternal <i>“</i>wisdom of God<i>,” </i>(<a name="ix.vi-p8.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#024">1Co 1:24</a><a name="ix.vi-p8.1"></a>.) There is nothing which we should more carefully avoid than the proud contempt that would deprive us of the 			 knowledge of the inestimable secret, which God has purposely <i>“hid from the wise and prudent, and revealed</i>” to the humble and <i>“to babes</i>,” (<a name="ix.vi-p8.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#021">Lu 10:21</a><a name="ix.vi-p8.2"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.vi-p9"></a>It was, I think, for the same reason that he chose <i>a virgin betrothed to a man</i> There is no foundation for Origen’s opinion, that he did this for the purpose of concealing from Satan the salvation which he was preparing to bestow on men. The marriage was a veil held out before the eyes of the world, that he who was 			 commonly <i>“supposed to be the son of Joseph</i>” (<a name="ix.vi-p9.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#023">Lu 3:23</a><a name="ix.vi-p9.1"></a>) might at length be believed and acknowledged by the godly to be the Son of God. Yet the entrance of Christ into the world was not destitute of glory; for the splendor of his Godhead was manifested from the commencement by his 			 heavenly Father. Angels announced that <i>“a Savior was born,”</i> (<a name="ix.vi-p9.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#011">Lu 2:11</a><a name="ix.vi-p9.2"></a>;) but their voice was only heard by the shepherds, and traveled no farther. One miracle, — everywhere published by <i>“the wise men who came from the 			 east</i>,” (<a name="ix.vi-p9.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#001">Mt 2:1</a><a name="ix.vi-p9.3"></a>) that they had seen a star which proclaimed the birth of the Highest King,—may have been highly celebrated. Yet we see how God kept his Son, as it were, in concealment, until the time of his full manifestation arrived, and then erected for him a platform, that he might be beheld by all.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.vi-p10"></a>The participle <a name="ix.vi-p10.1"></a>μεμνηστευμένην, which is employed by the Evangelist, signifies that the virgin had then been engaged to her bridegroom, but was not yet given as a wife to her husband. For it was customary among Jewish parents to keep their daughters some time at home, after they had been betrothed to men; otherwise, the law relating 			 to the seduction of a <i>“</i>betrothed damsel” (<a name="ix.vi-p10.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#023">De 22:23</a><a name="ix.vi-p10.2"></a>) would have been unnecessary. Luke says that <i>Joseph was of the house of David; 			 </i>for families are usually reckoned by the names of the men; but on this point we shall speak more fully in another place.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.vi-p11"></a><a name="ix.vi-p11.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.vi-p12"></a><b>28. </b><i>Hail, thou who hast obtained favor</i> The angel’s commission being of an astonishing and almost incredible description, he opens it with a commendation of the grace of God. And certainly, since our limited capacities admit too slender a portion of knowledge for comprehending the vast greatness of the works of 			 God, our best remedy is, to elevate them to meditation on his boundless grace. A conviction of the Divine goodness is the entrance of faith, and the angel properly observes this order, that, after preparing the heart of the virgin by meditation on the grace of God, he may enlarge it to receive an incomprehensible mystery. For the participle <a name="ix.vi-p12.1"></a>κεχαριτωμένη, which Luke employs, denotes the undeserved 			 favor of God. This appears more clearly from the Epistle to the Ephesians, (<a name="ix.vi-p12.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#006">Eph 1:6</a><a name="ix.vi-p12.2"></a>,) where, speaking of our reconciliation to <i>God, </i>Paul says, God <i>“</i>hath made us accepted (<a name="ix.vi-p12.3"></a>ἐχαρίτωσεν) in the Beloved:” that is, he has received into his favor, and embraced with kindness, us who were formerly his enemies.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.vi-p13"></a>The angel adds, <i>the Lord is with thee</i> To those on whom he has once bestowed his love God shows himself gracious and kind, follows and <i>“</i>crowns them with loving-kindness,” (<a name="ix.vi-p13.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#004">Ps 103:4</a><a name="ix.vi-p13.1"></a>.) Next comes the third clause, that she is <i>blessed among women. Blessing </i>is here put down as the result and proof of the Divine kindness. The word <i>Blessed</i> does not, 			 in my opinion, mean, Worthy of praise; but rather means, Happy. <i>Thus, </i>Paul often supplicates for believers, first “grace” and then “peace,” (<a name="ix.vi-p13.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#007">Ro 1:7</a><a name="ix.vi-p13.2"></a>; <a name="ix.vi-p13.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#002">Eph 1:2</a><a name="ix.vi-p13.3"></a>,) that is, every kind of blessings; implying that we shall then be 			 truly happy and rich, when we are beloved by God, from whom all blessings proceed. But if Mary’s happiness, righteousness, and life, flow from the undeserved love of God, if her virtues and all her excellence are nothing more than the Divine kindness, it is the height of absurdity to tell us that we should seek from her what she derives from another quarter in the same manner as ourselves. With extraordinary ignorance have the Papists, by an enchanter’s trick, changed this salutation into a 			 prayer, and have carried their folly so far, that their preachers are not permitted, in the pulpit, to implore the grace of the Spirit, except through their <i>Hail, Mary</i>    			  <a name="fr_22"></a><a href="#fn_22"><font size="1">23</font></a>
  			  But not only are these words a simple congratulation. They unwarrantably assume an office which does not belong to them, and which God committed to none but an angel. Their silly ambition leads them into a second blunder, for they salute a person who is absent.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.vi-p15"></a><a name="ix.vi-p15.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.vi-p16"></a><b>29. </b><i>When she had seen him, she was agitated</i> Luke does not say that <i>she was agitated </i>by the presence of the angel, but <i>by his address. </i>Why then does he also mention his presence?   			  <a name="fr_23"></a><a href="#fn_23"><font size="1">24</font></a>
  			  The reason, I think, is this. Perceiving in the angel something of heavenly glory, she was seized with sudden dread arising out of reverence for God. <i>She was agitated, </i>because she felt that she had received a salutation, not from a mortal man, but from an angel of God. But Luke does not say that she was so <i>agitated </i>as to have lost 			 recollection. On the contrary, he mentions an indication of an attentive and composed mind; for he afterwards adds, <i>and was considering what that salutation would be: </i>that is, what was its object, and what was its meaning. It instantly occurred to her that the angel had not been sent for a trifling purpose. This example reminds us, first, that we ought not to be careless observers 			 of the works of God; and, secondly, that our consideration of them ought to be regulated by fear and reverence.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.vi-p18"></a><a name="ix.vi-p18.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.vi-p19"></a><b>30. </b><i>Fear not, Mary</i> He bids her lay aside fear. Let us always remember—what arises from the weakness of the flesh—that, whenever the feeblest ray of the Divine glory bursts upon us, we cannot avoid being alarmed. When we become aware, in good earnest, of the presence of <i>God, </i>we cannot think of it apart from its effects.   			  <a name="fr_24"></a><a href="#fn_24"><font size="1">25</font></a>
  			  Accordingly, as we are all amenable to his tribunal, fear gives rise to trembling, until God manifests himself as a Father. The holy virgin saw in her own nation such a mass of crimes, that she had good reason for dreading heavier punishments. To remove this fear, the angel declares that he has come to certify and announce an inestimable blessing. The Hebrew idiom, Thou <i>hast found 			 favor, </i>is used by Luke instead of, “God has been merciful to thee:” for a person is said to <i>find favor, </i>not when he has sought it, but when it has been freely offered to him. Instances of this are so well known, that it would be of no use to quote them.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.vi-p21"></a><a name="ix.vi-p21.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.vi-p22"></a><b>31. </b><i>Behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb</i> The angel adapts his words, first to Isaiah’s prophecy, (<a name="ix.vi-p22.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014">Isa 7:14</a><a name="ix.vi-p22.1"></a>,) and next to other passages of the Prophets, with the view of affecting more powerfully the 			 mind of the virgin: for such prophecies were well known and highly esteemed among the godly. At the same time, it ought to be observed that the angel did not merely speak in private to the ear of the virgin, but brought <i>glad tidings, (</i><a name="ix.vi-p22.2"></a>εὐαγγέλιον<i>,) </i>which were shortly afterwards to be 			 published throughout the whole world. It was not without the purpose of God, that the agreement, between ancient prophecies and the present message respecting the manifestation of Christ, was so clearly pointed out. The word <i>conceive</i> is enough to set aside the dream of Marcion and Manichaeus: for it is easy to gather from it that Mary brought forth not an ethereal body or phantom, 			 but the fruit which she had previously conceived in her womb.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.vi-p23"></a><i>Thou shalt call his name Jesus</i> The reason of the name is given by Matthew: <i>for he shall save his people from their sins,</i> <b>(</b><a name="ix.vi-p23.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021">Mt 1:21</a><a name="ix.vi-p23.1"></a><b>.)</b> And so the name contains a promise of salvation, and points out the object for which <i>Christ</i> was sent by the Father into the world, as he tells us that he “came not to judge the world, but to save the world,” (<a name="ix.vi-p23.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#047">Joh 12:47</a><a name="ix.vi-p23.2"></a>.) Let us remember that not by the will of men, but by the command of God, was this name given to him by the angel, that our faith may have its foundation, not in earth, but in heaven. It is derived from the Hebrew word <a name="ix.vi-p23.3"></a>ישע, salvation, from which comes <a name="ix.vi-p23.4"></a>הושיע, which signifies to save. It is a waste of ingenuity to contend that it differs from the Hebrew name <a name="ix.vi-p23.5"></a>יהושוע, (Jehoshua or Joshua.) The Rabbins everywhere write the word <i>Jesu; </i>and they do this with evident malice, that they may not bestow on Christ an honorable 			 name, but, on the contrary, may insinuate that he is some pretended Jew. Their manner of writing it, accordingly, is of no more importance than the barking of a dog. The objection that it is far beneath the dignity of the Son of God to have a name in common with others, might equally apply to the name <i>Christ, </i>or <i>Anointed</i> But the solution of both is easy. What was exhibited in shadow under the law is fully and actually manifested in the Son of God; or, what was then a figure is in him a substance. There is another objection of as little weight. They assert that the name of Jesus is not worthy of veneration and awe, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, (<a name="ix.vi-p23.6"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#009">Phil. 2:9</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#010">10</a><a name="ix.vi-p23.6"></a>,) if it does not belong exclusively to the Son of God. For Paul does not attribute to him a magical name, as if in its very syllables majesty resided, but his language simply means that Christ has received from the Father the highest authority, to which the whole world ought to submit. Let us then bid adieu to such imaginations, and know, that the name 			 <i>Jesus </i>was given to Christ, in order that believers may be instructed to seek in him what had formerly been shadowed out under the Law.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.vi-p24"></a><a name="ix.vi-p24.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.vi-p25"></a><b>32. </b><i>He shall be great</i> The angel had said the same thing about John the Baptist, and yet did not intend to make him equal to Christ. But the Baptist is great in his own class, while the greatness of Christ is immediately explained to be such as raises him above all creatures. For to him alone this belongs as his 			 own peculiar prerogative to be called the Son of God. So the apostle argues.</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="ix.vi-p26"></a>Unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? (<a name="ix.vi-p26.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#005">Heb 1:5</a><a name="ix.vi-p26.1"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.vi-p27"></a>Angels and kings, I admit, are sometimes dignified with this title in Scripture; but they are denominated in common the sons of God, on account of their high rank. But it is perfectly clear and certain, that God distinguishes his own Son from all the others, when he thus addresses him particularly, Thou art my Son, (<a name="ix.vi-p27.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007">Ps 2:7</a><a name="ix.vi-p27.1"></a>.) Christ is not confounded either with 			 angels or with men, so as to be one of the multitude of the sons of God; but what is given to him no other has a right to claim. The sons of God are kings, not certainly by natural right, but because God has bestowed on them so great an honor. Even angels have no right to this distinction, except on account of their high rank among creatures, in subordination to the Great Head, (<a name="ix.vi-p27.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#021">Eph 1:21</a><a name="ix.vi-p27.2"></a>.) We too are 			 sons, but by adoption, which we obtain by faith; for we have it not from nature: Christ is the only Son, the only-begotten of the Father, (<a name="ix.vi-p27.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014">Joh 1:14</a><a name="ix.vi-p27.3"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.vi-p28"></a>The future tense of the verb, he shall be called <i>the Son of the Highest, </i>is tortured by that filthy dog   			  <a name="fr_25"></a><a href="#fn_25"><font size="1">26</font></a>
  			  Servetus to prove that Christ is not the eternal Son of <i>God, </i>but began to be so considered, when he took upon him our flesh. This is an intolerable slander. He argues that Christ was not the Son of God before he appeared in the world clothed with flesh; because the angel says, <i>He shall be called</i> On the contrary, I maintain, the words of the angel mean nothing more than that he, who had been the Son of God from eternity, would be manifested as such in the flesh, (<a name="ix.vi-p29.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016">1Ti 3:16</a><a name="ix.vi-p29.4"></a>;) for <i>to be called </i>denotes clear knowledge. There is a wide 			 difference between the two statements, — that Christ began to be the Son of God, which he was not before, — and that he was manifested among men, in order that they might know him to be the person who had been formerly promised. Certainly, in every age God has been addressed by his people as a Father, and hence it follows, that he had a Son in heaven, from whom and by whom men obtained the sonship. For men take too much upon them, if they venture to boast of being the sons of God, in any other 			 respect than as members of the only-begotten Son, (<a name="ix.vi-p29.5"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018">Joh 1:18</a><a name="ix.vi-p29.5"></a>.) Certain it is, that confidence in the Son alone, as Mediator, inspired the holy fathers with confidence to employ so honorable an address. That more complete knowledge, of which we are now speaking, is elsewhere explained by Paul to mean, that we are now at liberty not only to call God our Father, but boldly to cry, Abba, 			 Father, (<a name="ix.vi-p29.6"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015">Ro 8:15</a><a name="ix.vi-p29.6"></a>; <a name="ix.vi-p29.7"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#006">Ga 4:6</a><a name="ix.vi-p29.7"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.vi-p30"></a><i>The Lord God will give unto him the throne of his father David</i> We have said that the angel borrows from the prophets the titles which he bestows on Christ, in order that the holy virgin might more readily acknowledge him to be the Redeemer formerly promised to the fathers. Whenever the prophets speak of the restoration of the church, 			 they direct all the hope of believers to the kingdom of David, so that it became a common maxim among the Jews, that the safety of the church would depend on the prosperous condition of that kingdom, and that nothing was more fitting and suitable to the office of the Messiah than to raise up anew the kingdom of David. Accordingly, the name of David is sometimes applied to the Messiah. <i>“</i>They shall 			 serve the Lord their God, and David their king,” (<a name="ix.vi-p30.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#009">Jer 30:9</a><a name="ix.vi-p30.1"></a>.) Again, “my servant David shall be a prince among them,” (<a name="ix.vi-p30.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#024">Ezek. 34:24</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#024">Ezek. 37:24</a><a name="ix.vi-p30.2"></a>.) “They shall seek the Lord their God, and David their king,” (<a name="ix.vi-p30.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005">Ho 3:5</a><a name="ix.vi-p30.3"></a>.) The passages in which he is called <i>“</i>the son of David” are sufficiently well known. In a word, the angel declares that in the person of Christ would be fulfilled the prediction of Amos, <i>“</i>In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen,” 			 (<a name="ix.vi-p30.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#011">Am 9:11</a><a name="ix.vi-p30.4"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.vi-p31"></a><a name="ix.vi-p31.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.vi-p32"></a><b>33. </b><i>And he shall reign over the house of Jacob</i> As salvation was promised, in a peculiar manner, to the Jews, (the covenant having been made with their father Abraham, <a name="ix.vi-p32.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#007">Ge 17:7</a><a name="ix.vi-p32.1"></a>,) and Christ, as Paul 			 informs us, “was a minister of the circumcision,” (<a name="ix.vi-p32.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#008">Ro 15:8</a><a name="ix.vi-p32.2"></a>,) the angel properly fixed his reign in that nation, as its peculiar seat and residence. But this is in perfect accordance with other predictions, which spread and extend the kingdom of Christ to the utmost limits of the earth. By a new and wonderful adoption, God has admitted into the family of Jacob the Gentiles, who formerly 			 were strangers; though in such a manner that the Jews, as the first-born, held a preferable rank; as it is said, “The Lord shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion,” (<a name="ix.vi-p32.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#003">Ps 110:3</a><a name="ix.vi-p32.3"></a>.) Christ’s throne was, therefore, erected among the people of Israel, that he might thence subdue the whole world. All whom he has joined by faith to the children of Abraham are accounted the true Israel. 			 Though the Jews, by their revolt, have separated themselves from the church of God, yet the Lord will always preserve till the end some “remnants” (<a name="ix.vi-p32.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#005">Ro 11:5</a><a name="ix.vi-p32.4"></a>;) for his “calling is without repentances” (<a name="ix.vi-p32.5"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#029">Ro 11:29</a><a name="ix.vi-p32.5"></a>.) The body of the people is apparently cut off; but we ought to 			 remember the <i>mystery</i> of which Paul speaks, (<a name="ix.vi-p32.6"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025">Ro 11:25</a><a name="ix.vi-p32.6"></a>,) that God will at length gather some of the Jews out of the dispersion. Meanwhile, the church, which is scattered through the whole world, is the spiritual <i>house of 			 Jacob; </i>for it drew its origin from Zion.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.vi-p33"></a><i>For ever</i> The angel points out the sense in which it was so frequently predicted by the prophets that the kingdom of David would be without end. It was only during his own reign and that of Solomon, that it remained wealthy and powerful Rehoboam, the third successor, hardly retained a tribe and a half. The angel now declares that, when 			 it has been established in the person of Christ, it will not be liable to destruction, and, to prove this, employs the words of Daniel, (<a name="ix.vi-p33.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#014">Da 7:14</a><a name="ix.vi-p33.1"></a>,) <i>of his kingdom there shall be no end</i>    			  <a name="fr_26"></a><a href="#fn_26"><font size="1">27</font></a>
  			  Though the meaning of the words is, that God will for ever protect and defend the kingdom of Christ and the church, so that it shall not perish on the earth “as long as the sun and moon endure,” (<a name="ix.vi-p34.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#005">Ps. 72:5</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#017">17</a><a name="ix.vi-p34.1"></a>,) yet its true perpetuity relates to the glory to come. So then, believers follow each other in this 			 life, by an uninterrupted succession, till at length they are gathered together in heaven, where they shall reign without end.</p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="ix.vi-p17"></a> “<a name="ix.vi-p17.1"></a>Cur ergo aspectus etiam meminit?” Calvin's allusion is brought out more clearly in his own vernacular. “<a name="ix.vi-p17.2"></a>Pourquoy donc dit-il, Quand elle l'eut veu?” — “Why then does he say,<i> When she had seen him?”</i></p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="ix.vi-p29"></a> The use of such epithets may not be easily reconciled to the refinements of modern taste; but, three centuries ago, few readers would be startled by them, and they are much more sparingly employed by Calvin than by many of his contemporaries. Not to mention that Paul says, <i>Beware of dogs, </i>(<a name="ix.vi-p29.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#002">Php 3:2</a><a name="ix.vi-p29.1"></a>,) and that the statement, <i>Without are dogs, </i>(<a name="ix.vi-p29.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#015">Re 22:15</a><a name="ix.vi-p29.2"></a>,) bears the impress of the <i>Alpha and Omega, </i>(<a name="ix.vi-p29.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#013">Re 22:13</a><a name="ix.vi-p29.3"></a>,) Servetus, to whom the epithet <i>“filthy” </i>is applied, had denied the fundamental doctrine of our Lord's supreme Divinity, and had luxuriated in the most revolting and blasphemous expressions. — <i>Ed.</i></p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="ix.vi-p34"></a> Daniel's prediction referred to runs thus: “His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.” The angel does not employ these words; but his departure from them is not strongly marked, and it can scarcely be doubted that he had this passage in his eye. — <i>Ed.</i></p>
