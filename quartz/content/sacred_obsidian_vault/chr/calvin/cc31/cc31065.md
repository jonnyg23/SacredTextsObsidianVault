Men are grown mad with an insatiable desire of gain. Christ charges them with folly, in collecting wealth with great care, and then giving up their happiness to <i>moths 			 </i>and to <i>rust, </i>or exposing it as a prey to thieves. What is more unreasonable than to place their property, where it may perish of itself, or be carried off by men?   			  <a name="fr_449"></a><a href="#fn_449"><font size="1">450</font></a>
  			  Covetous men, indeed, take no thought of this. They lock up their riches in well-secured chests, but cannot prevent them from being exposed to <i>thieves </i>or to <i>moths</i>  They are blind and destitute of sound judgment, who give themselves so much toil and uneasiness in amassing wealth, which is liable to putrefaction, or 			 robbery, or a thousand other accidents: particularly, when God allows us a place <i>in heaven for laying up a treasure, </i>and kindly invites us to enjoy riches which never perish.</p>

 <p><a name="ix.lvii-p11"></a><b>20. </b><i>But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven</i>  They are said to do so, who, instead of entangling themselves in the snares of this world, make it their care and their business to meditate on the heavenly life. In Luke’s narrative, no mention is made of 			 the contrast between <i>laying up treasures on the earth </i>and <i>laying up treasures in heaven; </i>and he refers to a different occasion for the command of Christ <i>to prepare bags, which do not grow old: </i>for he had previously said, <i>Sell what you possess, and give alms</i>  It is a harsh and unpleasant thing for men to strip themselves of their own wealth; and with the view of alleviating their uneasiness, he holds out a large and magnificent hope of remuneration. Those who assist their poor brethren <i>on the earth lay up for themselves treasures in heaven, </i>according to the saying of Solomon,</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="ix.lvii-p12"></a>“He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth to the Lord, and that which he hath given will he pay him again,” <br> 			 (<a name="ix.lvii-p12.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#017">Pr 19:17</a><a name="ix.lvii-p12.2"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.lvii-p13"></a>The command to <i>sell possessions</i> must not be literally interpreted, as if a Christian were not at liberty to retain any thing for himself. He only intended to show, that we must not be satisfied with bestowing on the poor what we can easily spare, but that we must not refuse to part with our estates, if their 			 revenue does not supply the wants of the poor. His meaning is, “Let your liberality go so far as to lessen your patrimony, and dispose of your lands.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.lvii-p14"></a><a name="ix.lvii-p14.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="ix.lvii-p15"></a><b>21.</b> <i>Where your treasure shall be</i>  By this statement Christ proves that they are unhappy men who have their treasures laid up on the earth: because their happiness is uncertain and of short duration. Covetous men cannot be prevented 			 from breathing in their hearts a wish for heaven: but Christ lays down an opposite principle, that, wherever men imagine the greatest happiness to be, there they are surrounded and confined. Hence it follows, that they who desire to be happy in the world   			  <a name="fr_450"></a><a href="#fn_450"><font size="1">451</font></a>
  			  renounce heaven. We know how carefully the philosophers conducted their inquiries respecting the supreme good.   			  <a name="fr_451"></a><a href="#fn_451"><font size="1">452</font></a>
  			  It was the chief point on which they bestowed their labor, and justly: for it is the principle on which the regulation of our life entirely depends, and the object to which all our senses are directed. If honor is reckoned the supreme good, the minds of men must be wholly occupied with ambition: if money, covetousness will immediately predominate: if pleasure, it will be impossible to prevent men from sinking into brutal indulgence. We have all a natural desire to 			 pursue happiness;   			  <a name="fr_452"></a><a href="#fn_452"><font size="1">453</font></a>
  			  and the consequence is, that false imaginations carry us away in every direction. But if we were honestly and firmly convinced that our happiness is in heaven, it would be easy for us to trample upon the world, to despise earthly blessings, (by the deceitful attractions of which the greater part of men are fascinated,) and to rise towards heaven. For this reason Paul, with the view of exciting believers to look upwards, and of exhorting them to meditate on the 			 heavenly life, (<a name="ix.lvii-p18.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#001">Col 3:1</a><a name="ix.lvii-p18.2"></a>,) presents to them Christ, in whom alone they ought to seek perfect happiness; thus declaring, that to allow their souls to grovel on the earth would be inconsistent and unworthy of those whose <i>treasure is in heaven</i></p>

In examining the principles of 				  Epicurus, he professes to feel very much at ease, but approaches the Stoics with greater respect, and acknowledges the ability with which they had conducted their argument. The perusal of the whole treatise will gratify a reader prepared to accompany powerful minds in their most intricate researches, or to hail abstruse disquisition clothed in the choicest language by one who, as Robert Hall said of Pascal, “can invest the severest logic with the charms of the most beautiful composition, and 				  render the most profound argumentation as entertaining as a romance.” But those studies have a far higher value. When we see the greatest minds tasked to their utmost strength, and yet utterly failing to discover, by unassisted reason, the path which leads to happiness, we appreciate more highly Leland's argument “On the advantage and necessity of Divine Revelation,” and bless the name of the Great Prophet, <i>who hath brought life and immortality to light by the Gospel, 				  </i>(<a name="ix.lvii-p17.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#010">2Ti 1:10</a><a name="ix.lvii-p17.3"></a>.) — <i>Ed.</i></p>
