 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="vii.xiii-p53"></a><b>1. </b><i>And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron</i>  This <i>census</i> had a different object from the former one, which we have just been considering, viz., that an equal distribution of the charges should be made in proportion to the number of the individuals. 			 First, as regarded age, a distinction must be observed between this tribe and the others; for we have already seen that all the Israelites above twenty years of age were numbered, because they were then fit to bear arms. But it was not without reason that a more mature age was required in the case of the Levites, so that they should not begin to discharge their ministry before their thirtieth year. For not only is strength and rigor of body requisite for spiritual warfare, but seriousness and 			 gravity also. If they had been admitted in their youth, their levity might have detracted from the reverence due to sacred things, since the young are often led to act intemperately by their fervor and licentiousness. Access to the sanctuary, therefore, was not permitted them till they had grown up to be men; for by their thirtieth year men ought to have become so staid, as that it shall be base and inexcusable for them to give way to the wantonness of youth.</p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="vii.xiii-p54"></a>From their fiftieth year they were released from their duties; since sloth and inactivity generally accompany old age. The case is different as to war, because we find many who are vigorous after their fiftieth year. Furthermore, since religion is more precious than all earthly affairs, diligent care was to be taken lest it should fall into disesteem on account of the idleness and somnolency of its ministers.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="vii.xiii-p55"></a><a name="vii.xiii-p55.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="vii.xiii-p56"></a><b>34. </b><i>And Moses and Aaron and the chief of the congregation</i>  Another exception is subjoined, viz., that none should be received unless they were free from all defect and blemish; for we have seen elsewhere that those, who were blind and lame, or defective in any part of their body, were excluded from the 			 tabernacle, lest their disfigurement should produce contempt; and also that they might be admonished by this external sign, to preserve themselves more diligently from all spiritual defilement. Therefore, those are said to enter into the sanctuary who are fit to exercise the priesthood; and hence the expression, “for the service,”   			  <a name="fr_425"></a><a href="#fn_425"><font size="1">426</font></a>
  			  is added.</p>  		  
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="vii.xiii-p58"></a>Inasmuch as the inequality (of their charges) might have been the source of envy, God’s authority is asserted at the end of the chapter, where Moses records that he was only acting ministerially, and that he distributed the offices among them according to God’s command.</p>
