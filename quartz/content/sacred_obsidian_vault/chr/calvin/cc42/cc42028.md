 <p><a name="vii.v.i-p4"></a><b>2</b>. And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all <i>men</i> have not faith.</p> 		     		  
 <p><a name="vii.v.i-p5"></a><b>2</b>. Et ut liberemur ab importunis et malignis hominibus: non enim omnium est fides.</p>

 <p><a name="vii.v.i-p10"></a><b>5</b>. And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ.</p> 		     		  
 <p><a name="vii.v.i-p11"></a><b>5</b>. Dominus autem dirigat corda vestra in dilectionem Dei, et exspectationem Christi.</p> 		    		  	   	 
 <p><a name="vii.v.i-p12"></a> </p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="vii.v.i-p13"></a><a name="vii.v.i-p13.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="vii.v.i-p14"></a><b>1</b> <i> Pray for us</i>. Though the Lord powerfully aided him, and though he surpassed all others in earnestness of prayer, he nevertheless does not despise the prayers of believers, by which the Lord would have us aided. It becomes us, after his example, eagerly to desire this aid, and to stir up our brethren to 		pray for us.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="vii.v.i-p15"></a>When, however, he adds — <i>that the word of God may have its course</i>, he shows that he has not so much concern and regard for himself personally, as for the entire Church. For why does he desire to be recommended to the prayers of the Thessalonians? That the doctrine of the gospel may <i>have its 		course</i>. He does not desire, therefore, so much that regard should be had to himself individually, as to the glory of God and the common welfare of the Church. <i>Course</i> means here dissemination;   		 <a name="fr_691"></a><a href="#fn_691"><font size="1">692</font></a>
  		 <i>glory</i> means something farther, — that his preaching may have its power and efficacy for renewing men after the image of God. Hence, holiness of life and uprightness on the part of Christians is the glory of the gospel; as, on the other hand, those defame the gospel who make profession of it with the mouth, while in the meantime they live in wickedness and baseness. He says — <i>as among you;</i> for this should be a stimulus to the pious, to see all others like them. Hence those that have already entered into the kingdom of God are exhorted to pray daily that it may <i>come</i>. (<a name="vii.v.i-p16.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#010">Mt 6:10</a><a name="vii.v.i-p16.2"></a>.)</p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="vii.v.i-p17"></a><a name="vii.v.i-p17.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="vii.v.i-p18"></a><b>2</b> <i>That we may be delivered</i>. The old interpreter has rendered it, not unhappily, in my opinion — <i>unreasonable</i>    		 <a name="fr_692"></a><a href="#fn_692"><font size="1">693</font></a>
  		 Now, by this term, as also by that which immediately follows, (<a name="vii.v.i-p19.2"></a>τῶν πονηρῶν,) <i>evil</i>, Paul means wicked and treacherous men, who lurked in the Church, under the name of Christians, or at least Jews, who with a mad zeal for the law furiously persecuted the gospel. He knew, however, how much danger 		impended over them from both these classes. Chrysostom, however, thinks that those only are meant who maliciously oppose the gospel by base doctrines,   		 <a name="fr_693"></a><a href="#fn_693"><font size="1">694</font></a>
  		 — not by weapons of violence, as for example, Alexander, Hymeneus, and the like; but for my part, I extend it generally to all kinds of dangers and enemies. He was at that time proceeding towards Jerusalem, and wrote in the midst of his journeyings. Now, he had already been divinely forewarned that <i>imprisonments and persecutions awaited him there</i>. (<a name="vii.v.i-p20.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#023">Ac 20:23</a><a name="vii.v.i-p20.2"></a>.) He means, however, <i>deliverance</i>, so that he may come off victorious, whether by life or by death.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="vii.v.i-p21"></a><i>All have not faith</i>. This might be explained to mean, “Faith is not in all.” This expression, however, were both ambiguous and more obscure. Let us therefore retain Paul’s words, by which he intimates that faith is a gift of God that is too rare to be found in all. God, therefore, calls many who do not come to him by faith. Many pretend to come to him, who 		have their heart at the farthest distance from him. Farther, he does not speak of all indiscriminately, but merely animadverts upon those that belong to the Church: for the Thessalonians saw that very many held faith in abhorrence;   		 <a name="fr_694"></a><a href="#fn_694"><font size="1">695</font></a>
  		 nay, they saw how small was the number of believers. Hence it would have been unnecessary to say this as to strangers; but Paul simply says that all that make a profession of faith are not such in reality. Should you take in all Jews, they appeared to have nearness to Christ, for they ought to have recognized him by means of the law and the prophets. Paul, there can be no question specially marks out those with whom he would have to do. Now, it is probable that 		they were those who, while they had the appearance and honorary title of piety, were nevertheless very far from the reality. From this came the conflict.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="vii.v.i-p23"></a>With the view of shewing, therefore, that it was not groundlessly, or without good reason, that he dreaded contests with wicked and perverse men, he says that faith is not common to all, because the wicked and reprobate are always mixed with the good, as <i>tares</i> are with the <i>good wheat</i>. (<a name="vii.v.i-p23.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#025">Mt 13:25</a><a name="vii.v.i-p23.1"></a>.) And this ought to be remembered by us whenever we have annoyance given us by wicked persons, who nevertheless desire to be reckoned as belonging to the society of Christians — that <i>all men have not faith</i>. Nay more, when we hear in some instances that the Church is disturbed by base factions, let this be a shield to us against offenses of this nature; for 		we shall not merely inflict injury upon pious teachers, if we have doubts as to their fidelity, whenever domestic enemies do them harm, but our faith will from time to time waver, unless we keep in mind that among those who boast of the name of Christians there are many that are treacherous.   		 <a name="fr_695"></a><a href="#fn_695"><font size="1">696</font></a>
 </p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="vii.v.i-p25"></a><a name="vii.v.i-p25.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="vii.v.i-p26"></a><b>3</b> <i> But God is faithful</i>. As it was possible that their minds, influenced by unfavorable reports, might come to entertain some doubts as to Paul’s ministry, having taught them that faith is not always found in men, he now calls them back to God, and says that he is <i>faithful</i>, so as to confirm them against all contrivances of men, by which they will endeavor to shake them. “They, indeed, are treacherous, but there is in God a support that is abundantly secure, so as to keep you from giving way.” He calls the Lord <i>faithful</i>, inasmuch as he adheres to his purpose to the end in maintaining the salvation of his people, seasonably aids them, and never forsakes them in dangers, 		as in <a name="vii.v.i-p26.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#013">1Co 10:13</a><a name="vii.v.i-p26.1"></a>,</p>  	 
 <p class="Center"><a name="vii.v.i-p27"></a>God is faithful, who will not suffer<br> 		you to be tried above that ye are able to bear.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="vii.v.i-p28"></a>These words, however, themselves shew that Paul was more anxious as to others than as to himself. Malicious men directed against him the stings of their malignity; the whole violence   		 <a name="fr_696"></a><a href="#fn_696"><font size="1">697</font></a>
  		of it fell upon him. In the mean time, he directs all his anxieties towards the Thessalonians, lest this temptation should do them any injury.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="vii.v.i-p30"></a>The term <i>evil</i> may refer as well to the thing, that is, malice, as to the persons of the wicked. I prefer, however, to interpret it of Satan, the head of all the wicked. For it were a small thing to be delivered from the cunning or violence of men, if the Lord did not protect us from all spiritual injury.</p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="vii.v.i-p31"></a><a name="vii.v.i-p31.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="vii.v.i-p32"></a><b>4</b> <i> We have confidence</i>. By this preface he prepares the way for proceeding to give the instruction, which we shall find him immediately afterwards subjoining. For the confidence which he says he has respecting them, made them much more ready to obey than if he had required obedience from them in a way of 		doubt or distrust. He says, however, that this hope, which he cherished in reference to them, was founded upon the Lord, inasmuch as it is his to bind their hearts to obedience, and to keep them in it; or by this expression, (as appears to me more probable,) he meant to testify, that it is not his intention to enjoin anything but by the commandment of the Lord. Here, accordingly, he marks out limits for himself as to enjoining, and for them as to obeying — that it should be only in the 		Lord.   		 <a name="fr_697"></a><a href="#fn_697"><font size="1">698</font></a>
  		 All, therefore, that do not observe this limitation, do to no purpose resort to Paul’s example, with the view of binding the Church and subjecting it to their laws. Perhaps he had this also in view, that the respect which was due to his Apostleship might remain unimpaired among the Thessalonians, however the wicked might attempt to deprive him of the honor that belonged to him; for the prayer which he immediately subjoins tends towards this object. For provided 		men’s hearts continue to be directed towards <i>love to God, and patient waiting for Christ</i>, other things will be in a desirable state, and Paul declares that he desires nothing else. From this it is manifest, how very far he is from seeking dominion for himself peculiarly. For he is satisfied provided they persevere in love to God, and in the hope of Christ’s coming. In following up with prayer his 		expression of confidence,   		 <a name="fr_698"></a><a href="#fn_698"><font size="1">699</font></a>
  		 he admonishes us that we must not relax in eagerness of prayer on the ground that we cherish good hope.</p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="vii.v.i-p35"></a><a name="vii.v.i-p35.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="vii.v.i-p36"></a>As, however, he states here in a summary manner the things that he knew to be most necessary for Christians, let every one make it his endeavor to make proficiency in these two things, in so far as he desires to make progress towards perfection. And, unquestionably, the love of God cannot reign in us unless brotherly love is also exercised. <i>Waiting for 		Christ</i>, on the other hand, teaches us to exercise contempt of the world, mortification of the flesh, and endurance of the cross. At the same time the expression might be explained as meaning, the <i>patience of Christ</i> — that which Christ’s doctrine begets in us; but I prefer to understand it as referring to the hope of ultimate redemption. For this is the only thing that sustains us in the warfare of the present 		life, that we wait for the Redeemer; and farther, this waiting requires patient endurance amidst the continual exercises of the cross.</p>  <a name="vii.v.ii"></a>  	  		 		     		  
 <p class="TableCaption16"><a name="vii.v.ii-p1"></a><a name="vii.v.ii-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#006">2 Thessalonians 3:6-10</a><a name="vii.v.ii-p1.1"></a></p> 		    		 		     		  
 <p><a name="vii.v.ii-p2"></a><b>6</b>. Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.</p> 		     		  
 <p><a name="vii.v.ii-p3"></a><b>6</b>. Praecipimus autem vobis, fratres in nomine Domini nostri Iesu Christi, ut vos subducatis ab omni fratre, qui inordinate ambulet, et non iuxta institutionem, quam accepit a nobis.</p> 		    		 		     		  
 <p><a name="vii.v.ii-p4"></a><b>7</b>. For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;</p> 		     		  
 <p><a name="vii.v.ii-p5"></a><b>7</b>. Ipsi enim scitis, quomodo oporteat nos imitari, quia non inordinate egimus inter vos:</p> 		    		 		     		  
 <p><a name="vii.v.ii-p6"></a><b>8</b>. Neither did we eat any man’s bread for nought; but wrought with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:</p> 		     		  
 <p><a name="vii.v.ii-p7"></a><b>8</b>. Neque gratis panem comedimus a quoquam, sed cum labore et sudore nocte dieque facientes opus, ne cui vestrum graves essemus.</p> 		    		 		     		  
 <p><a name="vii.v.ii-p8"></a><b>9</b>. Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us.</p> 		     		  
 <p><a name="vii.v.ii-p9"></a><b>9</b>. Non quod non habeamus potestatem, sed ut nos ipsos exemplar proponeremus vobis ad imitandum vos.</p> 		    		 		     		  
 <p><a name="vii.v.ii-p10"></a><b>10</b>. For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.</p> 		     		  
 <p><a name="vii.v.ii-p11"></a><b>10</b>. Etenim quum essemus apud vos, hoc vobis praecepimus, ut, qui laborare non vult, is neque comedat.</p> 		    		  	   	 
 <p><a name="vii.v.ii-p12"></a> </p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="vii.v.ii-p13"></a><a name="vii.v.ii-p13.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p class="Bold"><a name="vii.v.ii-p14"></a>  	 
 </p><p><a name="vii.v.ii-p15"></a>He now proceeds to the correcting of a particular fault. As there were some indolent, and at the same time curious and prattling persons, who, in order that they might scrape together a living at the expense of others, wandered about from house to house, he forbids that their indolence should be encouraged by indulgence,   		 <a name="fr_699"></a><a href="#fn_699"><font size="1">700</font></a>
  		 and teaches that those live holily who procure for themselves the necessaries of life by honorable and useful labor. And in the first place, he applies the appellation of <i>disorderly </i>persons, not to those that are of a dissolute life, or to those whose characters are stained by flagrant crimes, but to indolent and worthless persons, who employ themselves in no honorable and 		useful occupation. For this truly is <a name="vii.v.ii-p16.2"></a>ἀταξία, (<i>disorder</i>,   		 <a name="fr_700"></a><a href="#fn_700"><font size="1">701</font></a>
  		) — not considering for what purpose we were made, and regulating our life with a view to that end, while it is only when we live according to the rule prescribed to us by God that this life is duly regulated. Let this order be set aside, and there is nothing but confusion in human life. This, also, is worthy to be noticed, lest any one should take pleasure in exercising himself apart from a legitimate call from God: for God has distinguished in such a manner the 		life of men, in order that every one may lay himself out for the advantage of others. He, therefore, who lives to himself alone, so as to be profitable in no way to the human race, nay more, is a burden to others, giving help to no one, is on good grounds reckoned to be <a name="vii.v.ii-p17.2"></a>ἄτακτος, (<i>disorderly</i>.) Hence Paul declares that such persons must be put away 		from the society of believers, that they may not bring dishonor upon the Church.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="vii.v.ii-p18"></a><b>6</b> <i>Now we command you in the name</i>. Erasmus renders it — “<i>by</i> the name,” as if it were an adjuration. While I do not altogether reject this rendering, I, at the same time, am rather of opinion that the particle <i>in</i> is redundant, as in very many other passages, and that in accordance with the Hebrew idiom. Thus the meaning will be, that this commandment ought to be received with reverence, not as from a mortal man, but as from Christ himself; and Chrysostom explains it in this manner. This <i>withdrawment</i>,   		 <a name="fr_701"></a><a href="#fn_701"><font size="1">702</font></a>
  		 however of which he speaks, relates — not to public excommunication but to private intercourse. For he simply forbids believers to have any familiar intercourse with drones of this sort, who have no honorable means of life, in which they may exercise themselves. He says, however, expressly — <i>from every brother</i>, because if they profess themselves to be Christians they are 		above all others intolerable, inasmuch as they are, in a manner, the pests and stains of religion.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="vii.v.ii-p20"></a><i>Not according to the injunction </i>— namely, that which we shall find him shortly afterwards adding — that food should not be given to the man that refuses to labor. Before coming to this, however, he states what example he has given them in his own person. For doctrine obtains much more of credit and authority, when we impose upon others no other burden 		than we take upon ourselves. Now he mentions that he himself was engaged in <i>working with his hands night and day</i>, that he might not burden any one with expense. He had, also, touched somewhat on this point in the preceding Epistle — to which my readers must have recourse   		 <a name="fr_702"></a><a href="#fn_702"><font size="1">703</font></a>
  		 for a fuller explanation of this point.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="vii.v.ii-p22"></a>As to his saying, that he <i>had not eaten any one’s bread for naught</i>, he assuredly would not have done this, though he had not <i>labored with his hands</i>. For that which is due in the way of right, is not a thing that is gratuitous, and the price of the labor which teachers   		 <a name="fr_703"></a><a href="#fn_703"><font size="1">704</font></a>
  		 lay out in behalf of the Church, is much greater than the food which they receive from it. But Paul had here in his eye inconsiderate persons, for all have not so much equity and judgment as to consider what remuneration is due to the ministers of the word. Nay more, such is the niggardliness of some, that, though they contribute nothing of their own, they, envy them their living, as if they were idle men.   		 <a name="fr_704"></a><a href="#fn_704"><font size="1">705</font></a>
  		 He, also, immediately afterwards declares that he waived his right, when he refrained from taking any remuneration, by which he intimates, that it is much less to be endured, that those, who do nothing, shall live on what belongs to others.   		 <a name="fr_705"></a><a href="#fn_705"><font size="1">706</font></a>
  		 When he says, that they <i>know how they ought to imitate</i>, he does not simply mean that his example should be regarded by them as a law, but the meaning is, that they knew what they had seen in him that was worthy of imitation, nay more, that the very thing of which he is at present speaking, has been set before them for imitation.</p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="vii.v.ii-p26"></a><a name="vii.v.ii-p26.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="vii.v.ii-p27"></a><b>9</b> <i>Not because we have not</i>. As Paul wished by his laboring to set an example, that idle persons might not like drones   		 <a name="fr_706"></a><a href="#fn_706"><font size="1">707</font></a>
  		 eat the bread of others, so he was not willing that this very thing   		 <a name="fr_707"></a><a href="#fn_707"><font size="1">708</font></a>
  		 should do injury to the ministers of the word, so that the Churches should defraud them of their proper livelihood. In this we may see his singular moderation and humanity, and how far removed he was from the ambition of those who abuse their powers, so as to infringe upon the rights of their brethren. There was a danger, lest the Thessalonians, having had from the beginning the preaching of the gospel from Paul’s mouth gratuitously,<b> 		</b>  		 <a name="fr_708"></a><a href="#fn_708"><font size="1">709</font></a>
  		 should lay it down as a law for the future as to other ministers; the disposition of mankind being so niggardly. Paul, accordingly, anticipates this danger, and teaches that he had a right to more than he had made use of, that others may retain their liberty unimpaired. He designed by this means to inflict the greater disgrace, as I have already noticed above, on those that do nothing, for it is an argument from, the greater to the less.</p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="vii.v.ii-p31"></a><a name="vii.v.ii-p31.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="vii.v.ii-p32"></a><b>10</b> <i> He that will not labor</i>. From its being written in <a name="vii.v.ii-p32.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#002">Ps 128:2</a><a name="vii.v.ii-p32.1"></a> —</p>

 <p><a name="vii.v.ii-p36"></a>it is certain that indolence and idleness are accursed of God. Besides, we know that man was created with this view, that he might do something. Not only does Scripture testify this to us, but nature itself taught it to the heathen. Hence it is reasonable, that those, who wish to exempt themselves from the common law,   		 <a name="fr_709"></a><a href="#fn_709"><font size="1">710</font></a>
  		should also be deprived of food, the reward of labor. When, however, the Apostle commanded that such persons should not eat, he does not mean that he gave commandment to those persons, but forbade that the Thessalonians should encourage their indolence by supplying them with food.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="vii.v.ii-p38"></a>It is also to be observed, that there are different ways of laboring. For whoever aids   		 <a name="fr_710"></a><a href="#fn_710"><font size="1">711</font></a>
  		the society of men by his industry, either by ruling his family, or by administering public or private affairs, or by counseling, or by teaching,   		 <a name="fr_711"></a><a href="#fn_711"><font size="1">712</font></a>
  		or in any other way, is not to be reckoned among the idle. For Paul censures those lazy drones who lived by the sweat of others, while they contribute no service in common for aiding the human race. Of this sort are our monks and priests who are largely pampered by doing nothing, excepting that they chant in the temples, for the sake of preventing weariness. This truly is, (as Plautus speaks,)   		 <a name="fr_712"></a><a href="#fn_712"><font size="1">713</font></a>
  		to “live musically.”   		 <a name="fr_713"></a><a href="#fn_713"><font size="1">714</font></a>

 <p><a name="vii.v.iii-p11"></a><b>11</b> <i>We hear that there are some among you</i>. It is probable that this kind of drones were, as it were, the seed of idle monkhood. For, from the very beginning, there were some who, under pretext of religion, either made free with the tables of others, or craftily drew to themselves the substance of the 		simple. They had also, even in the time of Augustine, come to prevail so much, that he was constrained to write a book expressly against idle monks, where he complains with good reason of their pride, because, despising the admonition of the Apostle, they not only excuse themselves on the ground of infirmity, but they wish to appear holier than all others, on the ground that they are exempt from labors. He inveighs, with good reason, against this unseemliness, that, while the senators are 		laborious, the workman, or person in humble life, does not merely live in idleness,   		 <a name="fr_715"></a><a href="#fn_715"><font size="1">716</font></a>
  		 but would fain have his indolence pass for sanctity. Such are his views.   		 <a name="fr_716"></a><a href="#fn_716"><font size="1">717</font></a>
  		 In the mean time, however, the evil has increased to such an extent, that idle bellies occupy nearly the tenth part of the world, whose only religion is to be well stuffed, and to have exemption from all annoyance   		 <a name="fr_717"></a><a href="#fn_717"><font size="1">718</font></a>
  		 of labor. And this manner of life they dignify, sometimes with the name of the Order, sometimes with that of the Rule, of this or that personage.   		 <a name="fr_718"></a><a href="#fn_718"><font size="1">719</font></a>
 </p>  	 
 <p><a name="vii.v.iii-p16"></a>But what does the Spirit say, on the other hand, by the mouth of Paul? He pronounces them all to be irregular and <i>disorderly</i>, by whatever name of distinction they may be dignified. It is not necessary to relate here how much the idle life of monks has invariably displeased persons of sounder judgment. That is a memorable saying 		of an old monk, which is recorded by Socrates in the Eighth Book of the Tripartite History — that he who does not labor with his hands is like a plunderer.   		 <a name="fr_719"></a><a href="#fn_719"><font size="1">720</font></a>
  		 I do not mention other instances, nor is it necessary. Let this statement of the Apostle suffice us, in which he declares that they are dissolute, and in a manner lawless.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="vii.v.iii-p18"></a><i>Doing nothing</i>. In the Greek participles there is, an elegant (<a name="vii.v.iii-p18.1"></a>προσωνομασία) <i>play upon words</i>, which I have attempted in some manner to imitate, by rendering it as meaning that they <i>do</i> nothing, but have <i>enough to do </i>in the way of curiosity.   		 <a name="fr_720"></a><a href="#fn_720"><font size="1">721</font></a>
  		 He censures, however, a fault with which idle persons are, for the most part, chargeable, that, by unseasonably bustling about, they give trouble to themselves and to others. For we see, that those who have nothing to do are much more fatigued by doing nothing, than if they were employing themselves in some very important work; they run hither and thither; wherever they go, they have the appearance of great fatigue; they gather all sorts of reports, and they put 		them in a confused way into circulation. You would say that they bore the weight of a kingdom upon their shoulders. Could there be a more remarkable exemplification of this than there is in the monks? For what class of men have less repose? Where does curiosity reign more extensively? Now, as this disease has a ruinous effect upon the public, Paul admonishes that it ought not to be encouraged by idleness.</p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="vii.v.iii-p20"></a><a name="vii.v.iii-p20.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="vii.v.iii-p21"></a><b>12</b> <i>Now we command such</i>. He corrects both of the faults of which he had made mention — a blustering restlessness, and retirement from useful employment. He accordingly exhorts them, in the first place, to cultivate repose — that is, to keep themselves <i>quietly </i>within the limits of their calling, or, as we commonly say, “<a name="vii.v.iii-p21.1"></a><i>sans faire bruit</i>,” (<i>without making a noise</i>.) For the truth is this: those are the most peaceable of all, that exercise themselves in lawful employments;   		 <a name="fr_721"></a><a href="#fn_721"><font size="1">722</font></a>
  		 while those that have nothing to do give trouble both to themselves and to others. Further, he subjoins another precept — that they should <i>labor</i>, that is, that they should be intent upon their calling, and devote themselves to lawful and honorable employments, without which the life of man is of a wandering nature. Hence, also, there follows this third injunction — that they should <i>eat their own bread;</i> by which he means, that they should be satisfied with what belongs to them, that they may not be oppressive or unreasonable to others.</p>  	 
 <p class="Center"><a name="vii.v.iii-p23"></a>Drink water, <i>says Solomon</i>, from thine own fountains, and let the streams flow down to neighbors. (<a name="vii.v.iii-p23.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#015">Pr 5:15</a><a name="vii.v.iii-p23.1"></a>.)</p>  	 
 <p><a name="vii.v.iii-p24"></a>This is the <i>first</i> law of equity, that no one make use of what belongs to another, but only use what he can properly call his own. The <i>second</i> is, that no one swallow up, like some abyss, what belongs to him, but that he be beneficent to neighbors, and that he may relieve their indigence by his abundance.   		 <a name="fr_722"></a><a href="#fn_722"><font size="1">723</font></a>
  		 In the same manner, the Apostle exhorts those who had been formerly idle to <i>labor</i>, not merely that they may gain for themselves a livelihood, but that they may also be helpful to the necessities of their brethren, as he also teaches elsewhere. (<a name="vii.v.iii-p25.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#028">Eph 4:28</a><a name="vii.v.iii-p25.2"></a>.)</p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="vii.v.iii-p26"></a><a name="vii.v.iii-p26.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="vii.v.iii-p27"></a><b>13</b> <i> And you, brethren</i>. Ambrose is of opinion that this is added lest the rich should, in a niggardly spirit, refuse to lend their aid to the poor, because he had exhorted them to <i>eat every one his own bread</i>. And, unquestionably, we see how many are 		unbefittingly ingenious in catching at a pretext for inhumanity.   		 <a name="fr_723"></a><a href="#fn_723"><font size="1">724</font></a>
  		 Chrysostom explains it thus — that indolent persons, however justly they may be condemned, must nevertheless be assisted when in want. I am simply of opinion, that Paul had it in view to provide against an occasion of offense, which might arise from the indolence of a few. For it usually happens, that those that are otherwise particularly ready and on the alert for beneficence, become cool on seeing that they have thrown away their favors by misdirecting them. 		Hence Paul admonishes us, that, although there are many that are undeserving,   		 <a name="fr_724"></a><a href="#fn_724"><font size="1">725</font></a>
  		 while others abuse our liberality, we must not on this account leave off helping those that need our aid. Here we have a statement worthy of being observed — that however ingratitude, moroseness, pride, arrogance, and other unseemly dispositions on the part of the poor, may have a tendency to annoy us, or to dispirit us, from a feeling of weariness, we must strive, nevertheless, never to leave off aiming at doing good.</p>  <a name="vii.v.iv"></a>

 <p><a name="vii.v.iv-p17"></a><b>14</b> <i>If any one obeys not</i>. He has already declared previously, that he commands nothing but <i>from the Lord</i>. Hence the man, that would not obey, would not be contumacious against a mere man, but would be rebellious against God himself;   		 <a name="fr_726"></a><a href="#fn_726"><font size="1">727</font></a>
  		 and accordingly he teaches that such persons ought to be severely chastised. And, in the <i>first</i> place, he desires that they be reported to him, that he may repress them by his authority; and, <i>secondly</i>, he orders them to be excommunicated, that, being touched with shame, they may repent. From this we infer, that we must not spare the reputation of those who cannot be 		arrested otherwise than by their faults being exposed; but we must take care to make known their distempers to the physician, that he may make it his endeavor to cure them.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="vii.v.iv-p19"></a><i>Keep no company</i>. I have no doubt that he refers to excommunication; for, besides that the (<a name="vii.v.iv-p19.1"></a>ἀταξία) <i>disorder</i> to which he had adverted deserved a severe chastisement, contumacy is an intolerable vice. He had 		said before, <i>Withdraw yourselves from them</i>, for they live in a <i>disorderly</i> manner, (<a name="vii.v.iv-p19.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#006">2Th 3:6</a><a name="vii.v.iv-p19.2"></a>.) And now he says, <i>Keep no company</i>, for they reject my admonition. He expresses, therefore, something more by this second manner 		of expression than by the former; for it is one thing to withdraw from intimate acquaintance with an individual, and quite another to keep altogether aloof from his society. In short, those that do not obey after being admonished, he excludes from the common society of believers. By this we are taught that we must employ the discipline of excommunication against all the obstinate   		 <a name="fr_727"></a><a href="#fn_727"><font size="1">728</font></a>
  		 persons who will not otherwise allow themselves to be brought under subjection, and must be branded with disgrace, until, having been brought under and subdued, they learn to obey.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="vii.v.iv-p21"></a><i>That he may be ashamed</i>. There are, it is true, other ends to be served by excommunication — that contagion may spread no farther, that the personal wickedness of one individual may not tend to the common disgrace of the Church, and that the example of severity may induce others to <i>fear</i>, (<a name="vii.v.iv-p21.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#020">1Ti 5:20</a><a name="vii.v.iv-p21.1"></a>;) but Paul touches upon this one merely — that those who have sinned may by shame be constrained to repentance. For those that please themselves in their vices become more and more obstinate: thus sin is nourished by indulgence and dissimulation. This, therefore, is the best remedy — when a feeling of shame is awakened in the mind of the offender, so that he begins to be displeased 		with himself. It would, indeed, be a small point gained to have individuals made ashamed; but Paul had an eye to farther progress — when the offender, confounded by a discovery of his own baseness, is led in this way to a full amendment: for shame, like sorrow, is a useful preparation for hatred of sin. Hence all that become wanton   		 <a name="fr_728"></a><a href="#fn_728"><font size="1">729</font></a>
  		 must, as I have said, be restrained by this bridle, lest their audacity should be increased in consequence of impunity.</p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="vii.v.iv-p23"></a><a name="vii.v.iv-p23.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="vii.v.iv-p24"></a><b>15</b> <i> Regard him not as an enemy</i>. He immediately adds a softening of his rigor; for, as he elsewhere commands, we must take care that the offender be not <i>swallowed up with sorrow</i>, (<a name="vii.v.iv-p24.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#007">2Co 2:7</a><a name="vii.v.iv-p24.1"></a>,) which would take place if severity were excessive. Hence we see that the use of discipline ought to be in such a way as to consult the welfare of those on whom the Church inflicts punishment. Now, it cannot but be that severity will fret,   		 <a name="fr_729"></a><a href="#fn_729"><font size="1">730</font></a>
  		 when it goes beyond due bounds. Hence, if we wish to do good, gentleness and mildness are necessary, that those that are reproved may know that they are nevertheless loved. In short, excommunication does not tend to drive men from the Lord’s flock, but rather to bring them back when wandering and going astray.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="vii.v.iv-p26"></a>We must observe, however, by what sign he would have brotherly love shewn — not by allurements or flattery, but by <i>admonitions</i>; for in this way it will be, that all that will not be incurable will feel that concern is felt for their welfare. In the mean time, excommunication is distinguished from anathema: for as to those that the Church marks out by the severity of its censure, Paul admonishes that they should not be utterly cast 		away, as if they were cut off from all hope of salvation; but endeavors must be used, that they may be brought back to a sound mind.</p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="vii.v.iv-p27"></a><a name="vii.v.iv-p27.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="vii.v.iv-p28"></a><b>16</b> <i>Now the Lord of peace</i>. This prayer seems to be connected with the preceding sentence, with the view of recommending endeavors after concord and mildness. He had forbidden them to treat even the contumacious   		 <a name="fr_730"></a><a href="#fn_730"><font size="1">731</font></a>
  		 as <i>enemies</i>, but rather with a view to their being brought back to a sound mind   		 <a name="fr_731"></a><a href="#fn_731"><font size="1">732</font></a>
  		 by brotherly admonitions. He could appropriately, after this, subjoin an injunction as to the cultivation of peace; but as this is a work that is truly Divine, he betakes himself to prayer, which, nevertheless, has also the force of a precept. At the same time, he may also have another thing in view — that God may restrain unruly persons,   		 <a name="fr_732"></a><a href="#fn_732"><font size="1">733</font></a>
  		 that they may not disturb the peace of the Church.</p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="vii.v.iv-p33"></a><a name="vii.v.iv-p33.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="vii.v.iv-p34"></a><b>17</b> <i>The salutation, with my own hand</i>. Here again he provides against the danger, of which he had previously made mention — lest epistles falsely ascribed to him should find their way into the Churches. For this was an old artifice of Satan — to put forward spurious writings, that he might detract from the 		credit of those that are genuine; and farther, under pretended designations of the Apostles, to disseminate wicked errors with the view of corrupting sound doctrine. By a singular kindness on the part of God, it has been brought about that, his frauds being defeated, the doctrine of Christ has come down to us sound and entire through the ministry of Paul and others. The concluding prayer explains in what manner God aids his believing people — by the presence of Christ’s grace.</p>
