 <p class="normal"><a name="i-p5"></a>This book treats of the Life of the Christian. Its  five chapters are arranged as to admit of being classed under two principal  heads.</p> 
 <p class="normal"><a name="i-p6"></a>First, it must be held to be an universally acknowledged point, that no man  is a Christian who does not feel some special love for righteousness, chap. i.  Second, in regard to the standard by which every man ought to regulate his life,  although it seems to be considered in chap. ii. only, yet the three following  chapters also refer to it. For it shows that the Christian has two duties to  perform. First, the observance being so arduous, he needs the greatest patience.  Hence chap. iii. treats professedly of the utility of the cross, and chap. iv.  invites to meditation on the future life. Lastly, chap. v. clearly shows, as in  no small degree conducive to this end, how we are to use this life and its  comforts without abusing them.</p>
