 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text09"><a name="vi.vii.i-p34"></a><b>1.</b> <i>And it shall be when thou art come.</i> The Israelites are commanded to offer their first-fruits, for the same reason that they were to pay the tribute for every soul; viz., that they might confess that they themselves, and all that they had, belonged to God. This was the only 				distinction, that the tribute was a symbol of their emancipation, that they might acknowledge themselves to be free, as having been redeemed by the special mercy of God; but by the firstfruits they testified that the land was tributary to God, and that they were masters of it by no other title than as tenants at will, so that the direct sovereignty and property of it remained with God alone. This, then, was the object of the first-fruits, that they might renew every year the recollection of 				their adoption; because the land of Canaan was given to them as their peculiar inheritance, in which they were to worship God in piety and holiness, and at the same time reflect that they were not fed promiscuously, like the Gentiles, by God, but like children; whence also their food was sacred. But we shall have to speak again elsewhere of the first-fruits, in as much as they were a part of the oblations; yet it was necessary to insert here their main object, that we might know that they were 				appointed to be offered by the people, in pious acknowledgment that their food was received from God, and to shew that, being separated from other nations, they were dependent upon the God of Israel alone.</p>  			 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="vi.vii.i-p35"></a><a name="vi.vii.i-p35.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text09"><a name="vi.vii.i-p36"></a><b>2.</b> <i>That thou shalt take of the first.</i> We know that in the first-fruits the whole produce of the year was consecrated to God. The people,   				 <a name="fr_337"></a><a href="#fn_337"><font size="1">338</font></a>
  				 therefore, bore in them a testimony of their piety to Him, whom they daily experienced to be their preserver, and the giver of their food. This typical rite has now, indeed, ceased, but Paul tells us that the true observation of it still remains, where he exhorts us, whether we eat or drink, to do all to the glory of God. (<a name="vi.vii.i-p37.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#031">1Co 10:31</a><a name="vi.vii.i-p37.1"></a>.) 				As to the place where the first-fruits were to be offered, and why God is said to have placed His name there, we shall hereafter consider, when we come to the sacrifices; I now only briefly touch upon what concerns the present subject.</p>  			 
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text09"><a name="vi.vii.i-p38"></a><i>I profess this day.</i> In these words the Israelites confess that they had not gained dominion of the land either by their own strength or good fortune, but by the free gift of God, and that according to His promise. There are, therefore, two clauses in this sentence; <i>first, </i>that God 				had gratuitously promised to grant that land to Abraham as the inheritance of his descendants; and, <i>secondly, </i>that He had performed His promise, not only when He had brought the children of Abraham into possession, but by adding’ to His grace by their peaceful enjoyment of it. He pursues the same point more fully immediately afterwards, where the Israelites are commanded to declare how wretched was the condition of their fathers, before the Lord 				embraced them with His favor, and vouchsafed unto them His mercy. The original word in verse 5, meaning to <i>answer, </i>I translate simply, according to the Hebrew idiom, to <i>speak </i>or <i>say; </i>unless to <i>testify </i>be thought better, which would be very suitable; for the solemn profession is here described, 				whereby they bound themselves every year to God. They do not count their origin from Abraham, but from Jacob, in whose person God’s grace shone forth more brightly; for being compelled to fly from the land of Canaan, he had spent a good part of his life in Syria, (for he did not return home, till he was old,) and then, being again driven into Egypt by the famine, he had at length died there. The land had not, therefore, fallen to them by hereditary right, nor by their own efforts; their father 				Jacob not having been permitted even to sojourn there. They call him a Syrian, because when he had married Laban’s daughters, and had begotten children, and was stricken in years before he had returned home, he might seem to have renounced the land of Canaan. Since then he had been content for many years with the dwelling which he chose for himself in Syria, his descendants justly confessed that he was a pilgrim and stranger, because of his long exile; and for the same reason that they also 				might be counted foreigners. They add that their father Jacob again abandoned the land of Canaan when he was forced by the famine to go down into Egypt; and whilst they recount that he sojourned there with a few, and afterwards grew into a mighty nation, they thus acknowledge that they were Egyptians, since they had sprung from thence, where was the beginning of their name and race. In the rest of the passage they further confirm the fact that they were led into the land of Canaan by the hand 				of God; because when they were oppressed by tyranny, they cried unto Him, and were heard. They are commanded also to celebrate the signs and wonders whereby their redemption was more clearly manifested, in order that they should unhesitatingly give thanks to God, and contrast His pure worship with all the imaginations of the heathen: otherwise, this would have been but a cold exercise of piety. What follows in the last verse, “And thou shalt rejoice,” etc., seems indeed to have been a promise, 				as if God, by setting before them the assurance of His blessing, added a stimulus to arouse the people to more cheerful affection; but the sense would appear more clear and natural if the <i>copula </i>were changed into the temporal adverb <i>then; </i>for this is the main thing in the use of our meat and drink, with a glad and joyful conscience to accept it as 				a testimony of God’s paternal favor. Nothing is more wretched than doubt; and therefore Paul especially requires of us this confidence, bidding us eat not without faith. (<a name="vi.vii.i-p38.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#023">Ro 14:23</a><a name="vi.vii.i-p38.1"></a>.) In order, then, to render the Israelites more prompt in their duty, Moses reminds them that they would only be able to rejoice freely in the use of God’s gifts, if they should have expressed their 				gratitude as He commanded.</p>  <a name="vi.vii.ii"></a>

First-fruits were offered of their fruits and ears of corn; but the representation was more lively in the bread itself; and, consequently, God would 				have them present tokens of their gratitude, not only from the barn, but from the mill, and the oven, so that whilst they eat their bread also, they might have Him before their eyes.</p>  <a name="vi.vii.iii"></a>

 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text09"><a name="vi.vii.iii-p6"></a><b>29.</b> <i>Thou shalt not delay.</i> We may gather from this passage that the first-fruits were offered, to the end that the Israelites should devote themselves and their possessions to God; for Moses enjoins these two things in conjunction, that they should not delay to consecrate to God 				of the abundance of their fresh fruits, and their first-born. But we know that, in offering the first-born, the recollection of their deliverance was revived, by the acknowledgment of the preservation of their race, and of their cattle. And there was, moreover, added to the grace of their redemption, the continual supply of food to them from day to day. I do not assent to their opinion who restrict the word <i>fullness</i>   				 <a name="fr_338"></a><a href="#fn_338"><font size="1">339</font></a>
  				 to wine, because it flows more abundantly from the press, and take the word <i>tear </i>  				 <a name="fr_339"></a><a href="#fn_339"><font size="1">340</font></a>
  				 to mean oil, because it runs less freely; nor do I approve of their notion who apply<i> fullness </i>only to dry fruits. It seems to me more proper to take <i>fullness </i>as the generic term, whilst <i>tear </i>is taken to denote liquids, as if Moses commanded them not only to offer grapes, and olive-berries, 				but the very drops which were expressed from the fruit. The other passages confirm this command, that they should not defraud God of the first-fruits, and so bury the remembrance of their redemption, and profane themselves in their very eating and drinking, but rather by this portion of the fruits sanctify the food of the whole year. Nor is it causelessly that Moses so often inculcates a point by no means obscure, since all these admonitions were despised and neglected by the Jews, as soon as 				they had returned from the Babylonish captivity, as Malachi complains in his third chapter.</p>
