 <p class="Body"><a name="ii.i-p1"></a>In an attempt to assist you in your efforts, this electronic publication has been updated to include a new series of footnotes in addition to the notes from the original Beveridge Translation. These footnotes were written by Robert J. Dunzweiler, Professor of Systematic Theology, Biblical Theology Seminary, Hatfield Pennsylvania. In both systems the footnotes are indicated by superscript numbers. To distinguish the two systems from each other, Professor Dunzweiler’s 			 notes are all proceeded by a capital D. We hope you like this new addition and that it will aid you in your studies.</p>
