 </p><p><a name="iv.XIX-p3"></a>He does not exist in place or time, but all things exist in him.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.XIX-p4"></a>  		  
 </p><p><a name="iv.XIX-p5"></a>BUT if through thine eternity thou hast been, and art, and wilt be; and to have been is not to be destined to be; and to be is not to have been, or to be destined to be; how does thine eternity exist as a whole forever? Or is it true that nothing of thy eternity passes away, so that it is not now; and that nothing of it is destined to be, as if it were not yet?</p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.XIX-p6"></a>Thou wast not, then, yesterday, nor wilt thou be to‑morrow; but yesterday and to‑day and to‑morrow thou art; or, rather, neither yesterday nor to‑day nor to‑morrow thou art; but simply, thou art, outside all time. For yesterday and to‑day and to‑morrow have no existence, except in time; but thou, although nothing exists without thee, nevertheless dost not exist in space or time, but all things exist in thee. For nothing contains thee, but thou 			 containest all.</p>
