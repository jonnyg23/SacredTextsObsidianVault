 <p><a name="v.LXII-p2"></a>  		  
 </p><p><a name="v.LXII-p3"></a>How it seems that of these three more sons than one are born.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.LXII-p4"></a>  		  
 </p><p><a name="v.LXII-p5"></a>BUT perhaps the following observation will prove inconsistent with this assertion. It should not be doubted that the Father and the Son and their Spirit each expresses himself and the other <a name="page_122"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 122</font></a> <a name="v.LXII-Page_122"></a>two, just as each conceives of, and understands, himself and the other two. But, if this is true, are there not in the supreme Being as many words as there are expressive beings, and as many words as there are beings who are expressed?</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.LXII-p6"></a>For, if more men than one give expression to some one object in thought, apparently there are as many words corresponding to that object as there are thinkers; since the word corresponding to it exists in the thoughts of each separately. Again, if one man thinks of more objects than one, there are as many words in the mind of the thinker as there are objects thought of.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.LXII-p7"></a>But in the thought of a man, when he thinks of anything outside his own mind, the word corresponding to the object thought of is not born of the object itself, since that is absent from the view of thought, but of some likeness or image of the object which exists in the memory of the thinker, or which is perhaps called to mind through a corporeal sense from the present object itself.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.LXII-p8"></a>But in the supreme Being, Father and Son and their Spirit are always so present to one another ‑‑for each one, as we have already seen, exists in the others no less than in himself ‑‑ that, when they express one another, the one that is expressed seems to beget his own word, just as when he is expressed by himself. How is it, then, that the Son and the Spirit of the Son and of the Father beget nothing, if each begets his own word, when he is expressed by 			 himself or by another? Apparently as many words as can be proved to be born of the supreme Substance, so many Sons, according to our former reasoning, must there be begotten of this substance, and so many spirits proceeding from it.</p>
