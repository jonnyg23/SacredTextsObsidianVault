 <p><a name="iv.XXII-p2"></a>  		  
 </p><p><a name="iv.XXII-p3"></a>He alone is what he is and who be is. ‑‑All things need God for their being and their well‑being.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.XXII-p4"></a>  		  
 </p><p><a name="iv.XXII-p5"></a>THEREFORE, thou alone, O Lord, art what thou art; and thou art he who thou art. For, what is one thing in the whole and another in the parts, and in which there is any mutable element, is not altogether what it is. And what begins from non‑existence, and can be conceived not to exist, and unless it subsists through something else, returns to non‑existence; and what has a past existence, which is no longer, or a future existence, which is not yet, ‑‑this does 			 not properly and absolutely exist.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="iv.XXII-p6"></a>But thou art what thou art, because, whatever thou art at any time, or in any way, thou art as a whole and forever. And thou art he who thou art, properly and simply; for thou hast neither a past existence <a name="page_27"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 27</font></a> <a name="iv.XXII-Page_27"></a>nor a future, but only a present existence; nor canst thou be conceived as at any time non‑existent. But thou art life, and light, and wisdom, and blessedness, and many goods of this nature. And yet thou art only one supreme good; thou art all‑sufficient 			 to thyself, and needest none; and thou art he whom all things need for their existence and wellbeing.</p>
