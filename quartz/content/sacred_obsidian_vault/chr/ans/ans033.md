 <p><a name="v.i-p1"></a>  		  
 </p><p><a name="v.i-p2"></a>In this book Anselm discusses, under the form of a meditation, the Being of God, basing his argument not on the authority of Scripture, but on the force of reason. lt. contains nothing that is inconsistent with the writings of the Holy Fathers, and especially nothing that is inconsistent with those of <a name="v.i-p2.1"></a>St. Augustine. ‑‑The Greek terminology is employed in Chapter LXXVIII., where it is stated that the Trinity may be said to consist of three 			 substances, that is, three persons.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.i-p3"></a>  		  
 </p><p><a name="v.i-p4"></a>CERTAIN brethren have often and earnestly entreated me to put in writing some thoughts that I had offered them in familiar conversation, regarding meditation on the Being of God, and on some other topics connected with this subject, under the form of a meditation on these themes. It is in accordance with their wish, rather than with my ability, that they have prescribed such a form for the writing of this meditation; in order that nothing in Scripture should be urged 			 on the authority of Scripture itself, but that whatever the conclusion of independent investigation should declare to be true, should, in an unadorned style, with common proofs and with a simple argument, be briefly enforced by the cogency of reason, and plainly expounded in the light of truth. It was <a name="page_35"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 35</font></a> <a name="v.i-Page_35"></a>their wish also, that I should not disdain to meet such simple and almost foolish objections as occur to me.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.i-p5"></a>This task I have long refused to undertake. And, reflecting on the matter, I have tried on many grounds to excuse myself; for the more they wanted this work to be adaptable to practical use, the more was what they enjoined on me difficult of execution. Overcome at last, however, both by the modest importunity of their entreaties and by the not contemptible sincerity of their zeal; and reluctant as I was because of the difficulty of my task and the weakness of my 			 talent, I entered upon the work they asked for. But it is with pleasure inspired by their affection that, so far as I was able, I have prosecuted this work within the limits they set.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.i-p6"></a>I was led to this undertaking in the hope that whatever I might accomplish would soon be overwhelmed with contempt, as by men disgusted with some worthless thing. For I know that in this book I have not so much satisfied those who entreated me, as put an end to the entreaties that followed me so urgently. Yet, somehow it fell out, contrary to my hope, that not only the brethren mentioned above, but several others, by making copies for their own use, condemned this 			 writing to long remembrance. And, after frequent consideration, I have not been able to find that I have made in it any statement which is inconsistent with the writings of the Catholic Fathers, or especially with those of <a name="v.i-p6.1"></a>St. Augustine. Wherefore, if it shall appear to any man that I have offered in this work any thought that is either too novel or discordant with the truth, I ask him not to denounce me at once as one who boldly seizes upon new ideas, or as a maintainer of 			 falsehood; but let <a name="page_36"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 36</font></a> <a name="v.i-Page_36"></a>him first read diligently Augustine’s books on the Trinity, and then judge my treatise in the light of those.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.i-p7"></a>In stating that the supreme Trinity may be said to consist of three substances, I have followed the Greeks, who acknowledge three substances in one Essence, in the same faith wherein we acknowledge three persons in one Substance. For they designate by the word <i>substance</i> that attribute of God which we designate by the word <i>person.</i></p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.i-p8"></a>Whatever I have said on that point, however, is put in the mouth of one debating and investigating in solitary reflection, questions to which he had given no attention before. And this method I knew to be in accordance with the wish of those whose request I was striving to fulfil. But it is my prayer and earnest entreaty, that if any shall wish to copy this work, he shall be careful to place this preface at the beginning of the book, before the body of the 			 meditation itself. For I believe that one will be much helped in understanding the matter of this book, if he has taken note of the intention, and the method according to which it is discussed. It is my opinion, too, that one who has first seen this preface will not pronounce a rash judgment, if he shall find offered here any thought that is contrary to his own belief.</p>
