 </p><p><a name="iv.V-p3"></a>God is whatever it is better to be than not to be; and he, as the only self‑existent being, creates all things from nothing.</p>

 </p><p><a name="iv.V-p5"></a>WHAT art thou, then, Lord God, than whom nothing greater can be conceived? But what art thou, except that which, as the highest of all beings, alone exists through itself, and creates all other things from nothing? For, whatever is not this is less than a thing which can be conceived of. But this cannot be conceived <a name="page_10"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 10</font></a> <a name="iv.V-Page_10"></a>of thee. What good, therefore, does the supreme Good lack, through which every good is? Therefore, thou art just, truthful, blessed, and whatever it 			 is better to be than not to be. For it is better to be just than not just; better to be blessed than not blessed.</p>
