   <h3 align="center">THE INTERVAL BETWEEN THE "SIXTH" AND "SEVENTH" VIALS.</h3>  <h3 align="center">THREE UNCLEAN SPIRITS.</h3>

 <p>Here we are told how the "Kings of the Earth" and their armies are to be gathered for the "Battle of Armageddon." "<b>THREE UNCLEAN SPIRITS</b>" like frogs, John does not say they were frogs, will come one out of the mouth of the "Dragon," one out of the mouth of the "Beast," and one out of the mouth of the "False Prophet." That they are not real frogs is clear from their miracle working power. They are the "<b>SPIRITS OF DEMONS</b>," working miracles, which go forth unto the "Kings of the Earth," and of the whole world, to gather them to the "Battle of that Great Day of God Almighty." They are the "<b>Seducing Spirits</b>" who go forth preaching the "<b>DOCTRINE OF DEVILS</b>" in the "latter times" of whom Paul warns Timothy. 1. Tim. 4:1. They are sent out by the "<b>SATANIC TRINITY</b>," the "Dragon," the "Beast," and the "False Prophet," on a <b>miracle working ministry</b>.</p>  
 <p>They are "<b>frog-like</b>" in that they come forth out of the pestiferous quagmires of darkness, do their devilish work in the evening shadows of "Man's Day," and creep, and croak, and defile, and fill the ears of the nations with their noisy demonstrations, until they set the kings and armies of the nations in enthusiastic commotion and movement toward the Holy Land to crush out the effort to establish the Kingdom of Christ on earth. We have an illustration of their method and purpose in the story of the destruction of King Ahab. 1. Kings 22:20-38.</p>  
 <p>The power of a delusive and enthusiastic sentiment, however engendered, to lead to destruction great hosts of men is seen in the Crusades to recover the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem. If a religious <a href="errata.htm#3">fanaticism</a> could, at 9 different times, cause hundreds of thousands of religious devotees to undergo unspeakable hardships for a religious purpose, what will not the <b>miracle working wonders</b> of the "<b>FROG-LIKE DEMONS</b>" of the last days of this Dispensation not be able to do in arousing whole nations, and creating vast armies to march in all directions from all countries, headed by their Kings, for the purpose of preventing the establishment of the Kingdom of the King of Kings in His own Land of Palestine?</p>
