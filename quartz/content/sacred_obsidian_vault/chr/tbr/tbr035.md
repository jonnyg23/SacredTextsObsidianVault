 <p align="center">Rev. 8:1.</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="1">"And when He had opened the '<b>SEVENTH SEAL</b>,' there was <b>SILENCE IN HEAVEN ABOUT THE SPACE OF HALF AN HOUR</b>."</font></dir>  
 <p>We must not forget that the "<b>SEVENTH SEAL</b>" includes all that happens during the sounding of the "<b>Trumpets</b>," and the pouring out of the "<b>Vials</b>," and so extends down to the ushering in of the Millennium. To illustrate, a rocket fired into the air may burst into "<b>seven stars</b>," and one of these stars into "<b>seven other stars</b>," and one of the second group of stars into a third group of "<b>seven stars</b>." So the "<b>Seventh</b>" Seal includes the "Seven Trumpets," and the "<b>Seventh</b>" Trumpet includes the "Seven Vials."</p>  
 <p>The "<b>SILENCE</b>" that followed the breaking of the "Seventh Seal" was preparatory to what was to follow during the sounding of the "Trumpets," and the pouring out of the "Vials." This "<b>SILENCE</b>" was something remarkable. The Four and Twenty Elders ceased their harp-playing; the angels hushed their voices, and the Cherubim and Seraphim and all the host of Heaven were silent, and so great was the <b>silence</b> that all Heaven was awed by it; and to add to the noticeableness of it, John added that it lasted for "<b>HALF AN HOUR</b>." Now a "half an hour" is not long when engaged in some pleasant employment, but it causes a nerve breaking tension when we do not know what is going to happen, and when a life is at stake a minute, or even a few seconds, seem to be hours. The suspense of the half hour of <b>SILENCE</b> in Heaven was intense. But why that half hour of silence? What did it portend? It was the period of silent preparation for the awful judgments that were to burst forth in the earth under the "Trumpets" and "Vials."</p>
