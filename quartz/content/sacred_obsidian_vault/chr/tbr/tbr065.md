   <h3 align="center">3. THE BLESSED DEAD.</h3>  
 <p align="center">Rev. 14:12-13.</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="1">"Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the Commandments of God, and the Faith of Jesus. And I heard a voice from Heaven saying unto me, Write, <b>blessed are the dead which die in the Lord FROM HENCEFORTH: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors: and their works do follow them</b>."</font></dir>  
 <p><a name="page_136"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 136</font></a></p>  
 <p>This is blessedly true of all saints but refers here to those who die <b>after</b> the False Prophet has issued the command that all who will not worship the "Image of the Beast <b>shall be killed</b>." Rev. 13:15. This is settled by the word <b>HENCEFORTH</b>. This warning is given for the benefit of those who in that day shall be tempted to compromise with evil in order to preserve their lives. Better to live and reign with Christ a <b>1000 years</b>, than with Antichrist <b>3½ years</b>. This special class of dead who "<b>DIE IN THE LORD</b>" will be blessed because they will be delivered from the trials and sufferings of the Great Tribulation, and will receive the "<b>MARTYR'S CROWN</b>" (Rev. 2:10), and they shall rest from their labors of stemming the tide of iniquity of those days, and their works follow with them (R. V.). During the "Great Tribulation" they that are loyal to God have no prospect before them but martyrdom, hence the need at this time of a special message of blessing to those who are faithful <b>until death</b>. What a contrast between the "Blessed Dead," and those who have the "Mark of the Beast." The former will <b>rest</b> from their labors, while the latter shall not <b>rest</b> day or night.</p>
