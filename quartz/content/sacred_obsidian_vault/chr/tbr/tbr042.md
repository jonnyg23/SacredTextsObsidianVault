And he opened the '<b>BOTTOMLESS PIT</b>,' and there arose a <b>smoke out of the 'Pit,'</b> as the smoke of a furnace; and the <b>Sun</b> and the <b>air</b> were <b>darkened</b> by reason of the smoke of the 'Pit.' And there came out of the smoke <b>LOCUSTS</b> upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as the <b>Scorpions</b> of the earth have power. And it was commanded them that they should <b>not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree</b>; but <b>only those men which have not the 'SEAL OF GOD' in their foreheads</b>. And to them it was given that they should <b>not kill them</b>, but that they should be <b>TORMENTED FIVE MONTHS</b>: and their torment was as the <b>TORMENT OF A SCORPION</b>, when he striketh a man. And in those days shall men <b>seek death</b>, and <b>shall not find it</b>: and shall <b>desire to die</b>, and <b>death shall flee from them</b>. And the <b>shape of the LOCUSTS</b> were like unto <b>HORSES PREPARED UNTO BATTLE</b>: and on their heads were as it were <b>crowns of gold</b>, and their faces were as the <b>faces of men</b>. And they had hair as the <b>hair of women</b>, and their teeth were as the <b>teeth of lions</b>. And they had '<b>Breastplates</b>,' as it were <b>Breast-plates of iron</b>; and the <b>sound of their wings</b> was as the <b>sound of chariots of many horses running to battle</b>. And they had <b>tails</b> like unto <b>SCORPIONS</b>, and there were <b>stings</b> in their tails: and their power was to hurt men <b>FIVE MONTHS</b>. And they had a King over them, which is the <b>ANGEL</b> of the 'Bottomless Pit,' whose name in the Hebrew tongue is <b>ABADDON</b>, but in the Greek tongue hath his name <b>APOLLYON</b>. One '<b>WOE</b>' is <b>past</b>; and, behold, there come '<b>TWO WOES</b>' more <b>hereafter</b>."</font></dir>  
 <p>At the sounding of the Fifth Trumpet John saw a <b>"STAR" fall</b>, or as the Revised Version has it, "<b>fallen</b> from Heaven." That it was not a <b>literal star</b> is clear, for in the next verse the "<b>STAR</b>" is spoken of as a <b>PERSON (He)</b>, and in the Old Testament angels were called "<b>Stars</b>." Job 38:7. Because the "<b>STAR</b>" was "<b>fallen from</b> </p>

 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> <b>Heaven</b>" does not imply that the "<b>ANGEL</b>," for that is what it was, was a "<b>FALLEN ANGEL</b>," or <b>SATAN</b> himself, as some have supposed. John simply meant that he saw the <b>descent</b> of the "<b>STAR</b>," or Angel, and so rapidly did it descend that it <b>appeared to be falling</b>. This is the <b>same "STAR ANGEL"</b> that in Rev. 20:1-3 comes down from Heaven, having the "<b>Key</b>" of the "<b>BOTTOMLESS PIT</b>," and a <b>great chain in his hand</b>, and <b>binds SATAN</b>, and casts him into the "<b>PIT</b>." This makes it clear that the "<b>STAR ANGEL</b>" is not <b>SATAN</b>. The work of both Angels is the same, to <b>unlock</b> and <b>lock</b> the "Bottomless Pit." It does not look reasonable that God would entrust the "Key" of the "Prison House" of the "Demons" to a "Fallen Angel," or even Satan himself.</p>
