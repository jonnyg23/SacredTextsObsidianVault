Some on account of physical infirmity, or to secure some particular successor. But Christ will not abdicate for any of these reasons. He will abdicate because He has <b>Finished the Work That Was Given Him to Do as the Son of Man</b>. He will not surrender His <b>Human Nature</b>, but His title "<b>Son of Man</b>" will merge back into that of "<b>Son of God</b>" so that the Divine <b>Godhead</b> shall thereafter act in its <b>Unity</b>, and God shall be "<b>ALL IN ALL</b>."</p>
