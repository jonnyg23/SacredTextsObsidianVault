   <h3 align="center">FOURTH TRUMPET.</h3>  <h3 align="center">(SUN, Moon and Stars Smitten.)</h3>  
 <p align="center">Rev. 8:12.</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="1">"And the '<b>FOURTH ANGEL</b>' sounded, and the <b>third part of the SUN was smitten</b>, and the <b>third part of the MOON</b>, and the <b>third part of the STARS</b>; so as the <b>third part</b> of them was <b>DARKENED</b>, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise."</font></dir>  
 <p>What happens under the sounding of this "Trumpet" is so similar to what happened under the "Sixth Seal" that it is not necessary to further dwell on it here. These are some of the "Signs" spoken of by Christ, in Luke's Gospel, that shall precede His Second Coming. There shall be signs in the <b>SUN</b>, and in the <b>MOON</b>, and in the <b>STARS</b>, and upon the earth distress of nations, with <b>PERPLEXITY</b>." Luke 21:25-28.</p>
