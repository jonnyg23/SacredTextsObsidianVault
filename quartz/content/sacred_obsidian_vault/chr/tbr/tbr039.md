 <p align="center">Rev. 8:10-11.</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="1">"And the <b>THIRD ANGEL</b> sounded, and there fell a '<b>GREAT STAR</b>' from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the <b>third part of the rivers</b>, and upon the <b>fountains of waters</b>; and the name of the '<b>Star</b>' is '<b>WORMWOOD</b>': and the third part of the waters (rivers) became <b>WORMWOOD</b>; and many men died of the waters, because they were made <b>bitter</b>."</font></dir>  
 <p>When the "Third Trumpet" sounded a "<b>GREAT STAR</b>" fell from heaven burning like a lamp (R. V. <b>Torch</b>). This will doubt-less be another "Meteor," that will assume the form of a "<b>Torch</b>" in its blazing path through the heavens, and when its gaseous vapors are scattered as it explodes, they will be absorbed by the <b>third part of the rivers and fountains of waters</b>, and they will be <b>poisoned by the noxious gases</b>, and made <b>bitter</b>, and many men shall die from drinking of those waters. "<b>Wormwood</b>" is a perennial herb, very bitter, and is used in the manufacture of "<b>Absinthe</b>." It is much used in France as a beverage, and is more intoxicating and destructive than ordinary liquors. This time is foretold by the Prophet Jeremiah. "Therefore thus saith the Lord of Hosts, because they have forsaken my law, Behold, I will feed them, even this people (Israel), with <b>WORMWOOD</b>, and give them <b>WATER OF GALL</b> to drink." Jer. 9:13-15.</p>
