 <p></p><p><a name="pg_268"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 268</font></a></p><p></p><p>That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life, . . . That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ.

 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Materialistic challenge</font></p>
 In the material world, thought has brought to light
 with great rapidity many useful wonders. With
 like activity have thought's swift pinions been rising
 towards the realm of the real, to the spiritual
 cause of those lower things which give impulse to inquiry. Belief in a material basis, from
 which may be deduced all rationality, is slowly yielding
 to the idea of a metaphysical basis, looking away from
 matter to Mind as the cause of every effect. Materialistic hypotheses challenge metaphysics to meet in final
 combat. In this revolutionary period, like the shepherd-boy with his sling, woman goes forth to battle with
 Goliath.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Confusion confounded</font></p>
 In this final struggle for supremacy, semi-metaphysical systems afford no substantial aid to scientific metaphysics, for their arguments are based on
 the false testimony of the material senses as
 well as on the facts of Mind. These semi-metaphysical
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_269"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 269</font></a></p><p></p><p>systems are one and all pantheistic, and savor of Pandemonium, a house divided against itself.
 </p><p></p><p>From first to last the supposed coexistence of Mind
 and matter and the mingling of good and evil have resulted from the philosophy of the serpent. Jesus' demonstrations sift the chaff from the wheat, and unfold the
 unity and the reality of good, the unreality, the nothingness, of evil.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Divine metaphysics</font></p>
 Human philosophy has made God manlike.  Christian
 Science makes man Godlike. The first is error; the latter
 is truth. Metaphysics is above physics, and
 matter does not enter into metaphysical premises or conclusions. The categories of metaphysics rest
 on one basis, the divine Mind. Metaphysics resolves
 things into thoughts, and exchanges the objects of sense
 for the ideas of Soul.
 <p></p><p>These ideas are perfectly real and tangible to spiritual
 consciousness, and they have this, advantage over the objects and thoughts of material sense,--they are good and
 eternal.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Biblical foundations</font></p>
 The testimony of the material senses is neither absolute nor divine. I therefore plant myself unreservedly
 on the teachings of Jesus, of his apostles, of
 the prophets, and on the testimony of the
 Science of Mind. Other foundations there are none.
 All other systems--systems based wholly or partly on
 knowledge gained through the material senses--are reeds
 shaken by the wind, not houses built on the rock.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Rejected theories</font></p>
 The theories I combat are these: (1) that all is matter;
 (2) that matter originates in Mind, and is as 
 real as Mind, possessing intelligence and life.
 The first theory, that matter is everything, is quite as
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_270"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 270</font></a></p><p></p><p>reasonable as the second, that Mind and matter coexist
 and cooperate. One only of the following statements can
 be true: (1) that everything is matter; (2) that everything is Mind. Which one is it?
 </p><p></p><p>Matter and Mind are opposites. One is contrary to
 the other in its very nature and essence; hence both cannot be real. If one is real, the other must be unreal. Only
 by understanding that there is but one power,--not two
 powers, matter and Mind,--are scientific and logical
 conclusions reached. Few deny the hypothesis that intelligence, apart from man and matter, governs the universe; and it is generally admitted that this intelligence
 is the eternal Mind or divine principle, Love.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Prophetic ignorance</font></p>
 The prophets of old looked for something higher than
 the systems of their times; hence their foresight of the new dispensation of Truth. But
 they knew not what would be the precise nature of the
 teaching and demonstration of God, divine Mind, in His
 more infinite meanings,--the demonstration which was
 to destroy sin, sickness, and death, establish the definition
 of omnipotence, and maintain the Science of Spirit.
 <p></p><p>The pride of priesthood is the prince of this world. It
 has nothing in Christ. Meekness and charity have divine
 authority. Mortals think wickedly; consequently they
 are wicked. They think sickly thoughts, and so become
 sick. If sin makes sinners, Truth and Love alone can
 unmake them. If a sense of disease produces suffering
 and a sense of ease antidotes suffering, disease is mental,
 not material. Hence the fact that the human mind alone
 suffers, is sick, and that the divine Mind alone heals.
 </p><p></p><p>The life of Christ Jesus was not miraculous, but it was
 indigenous to his spirituality,--the good soil wherein the
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_271"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 271</font></a></p><p></p><p>seed of Truth springs up and bears much fruit. Christ's
 Christianity is the chain of scientific being reappearing
 in all ages, maintaining its obvious correspondence with
 the Scriptures and uniting all periods in the design of
 God. Neither emasculation, illusion, nor insubordination
 exists in divine Science.
 </p><p></p><p>Jesus instructed his disciples whereby to heal the sick
 through Mind instead of matter. He knew that the philosophy, Science, and proof of Christianity were in Truth,
 casting out all inharmony.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Studious disciples</font></p>
 In Latin the word rendered disciple signifies student;
 and the word indicates that the power of healing was not
 a supernatural gift to those learners, but the
 result of their cultivated spiritual understanding of the divine Science, which their Master demonstrated
 by healing the sick and sinning. Hence the universal application of his saying: "Neither pray I for these alone,
 but for them also which shall believe on me [understand
 me] through their word."
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">New Testament basis</font></p>
 Our Master said, "But the Comforter . . . shall
 teach you all things." When the Science of Christianity
 appears, it will lead you into all truth.  The
 Sermon on the Mount is the essence of this
 Science, and the eternal life, not the death of Jesus, is
 its outcome.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Modern evangel</font></p>
 Those, who are willing to leave their nets or to cast
 them on the right side for Truth, have the opportunity
 now, as aforetime, to learn and to practise
 Christian healing. The Scriptures contain it.
 The spiritual import of the Word imparts this power.
 But, as Paul says, "How shall they hear without a
 preacher? and how shall they preach, except they be
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_272"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 272</font></a></p><p></p><p>sent?" If sent, how shall they preach, convert, and heal
 multitudes, except the people hear?
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Spirituality of Scripture</font></p>
 The spiritual sense of truth must be gained before
 Truth can be understood. This sense is assimilated only
 as we are honest, unselfish, loving, and meek.
 In the soil of an "honest and good heart" the
 seed must be sown; else it beareth not much fruit, for the
 swinish element in human nature uproots it. Jesus said:
 "Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures." The spiritual
 sense of the Scriptures brings out the scientific sense, and
 is the new tongue referred to in the last chapter of Mark's
 Gospel.
 <p></p><p>Jesus' parable of "the sower" shows the care our
 Master took not to impart to dull ears and gross hearts
 the spiritual teachings which dulness and grossness could
 not accept. Reading the thoughts of the people, he said:
 "Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast
 ye your pearls before swine."
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Unspiritual contrasts</font></p>
 It is the spiritualization of thought and Christianization
 of daily life, in contrast with the results of the ghastly farce
 of material existence; it is chastity and purity,
 in contrast with the downward tendencies
 and earthward gravitation of sensualism and impurity,
 which really attest the divine origin and operation of Christian Science. The triumphs of Christian Science are recorded in the destruction of error and evil, from which are
 propagated the dismal beliefs of sin, sickness, and death.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">God the Principle of all</font></p>
 The divine Principle of the universe must interpret the
 universe. God is the divine Principle of all that represents Him and of all that really exists. Christian Science, as demonstrated by Jesus, alone
 reveals the natural, divine Principle of Science.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_273"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 273</font></a></p><p></p><p>Matter and its claims of sin, sickness, and death are
 contrary to God, and cannot emanate from Him. There
 is no material truth. The physical senses can take no
 cognizance of God and spiritual Truth. Human belief
 has sought out many inventions, but not one of them
 can solve the problem of being without the divine Principle of divine Science. Deductions from material hypotheses are not scientific. They differ from real Science
 because they are not based on the divine law.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Science versus sense</font></p>
 Divine Science reverses the false testimony of the material senses, and thus tears away the foundations of error. Hence the enmity between
 Science and the senses, and the impossibility
 of attaining perfect understanding till the errors of sense
 are eliminated.
 <p></p><p>The so-called laws of matter and of medical science have
 never made mortals whole, harmonious, and immortal.
 Man is harmonious when governed by Soul. Hence the
 importance of understanding the truth of being, which
 reveals the laws of spiritual existence.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Spiritual law the only law</font></p>
 God never ordained a material law to annul the spiritual
 law. If there were such a material law, it would oppose
 the supremacy of Spirit, God, and impugn the
 wisdom of the creator. Jesus walked on the
 waves, fed the multitude, healed the sick, and raised the
 dead in direct opposition to material laws. His acts were
 the demonstration of Science, overcoming the false claims
 of material sense or law.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Material knowledge illusive</font></p>
 Science shows that material, conflicting mortal opinions and beliefs emit the effects of error at all times, but
 this atmosphere of mortal mind cannot be destructive to
 morals and health when it is opposed promptly and per<p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_274"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 274</font></a></p><p></p><p>sistently by Christian Science. Truth and Love antidote
 this mental miasma, and thus invigorate and sustain existence. Unnecessary knowledge gained from
 the five senses is only temporal, - the conception of mortal mind, the offspring of sense, not
 of Soul, Spirit,--and symbolizes all that is evil and
 perishable. Natural science, as it is commonly called, is
 not really natural nor scientific, because it is deduced from
 the evidence of the material senses. Ideas, on the contrary, are born of Spirit, and are not mere inferences
 drawn from material premises.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Five senses deceptive</font></p>
 The senses of Spirit abide in Love, and they demonstrate Truth and Life. Hence Christianity and the Science which expounds it are based on spiritual
 understanding, and they supersede the socalled laws of matter. Jesus demonstrated this great
 verity. When what we erroneously term the five physical
 senses are misdirected, they are simply the manifested
 beliefs of mortal mind, which affirm that life, substance,
 and intelligence are material, instead of spiritual. These
 false beliefs and their products constitute the flesh, and
 the flesh wars against Spirit.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Impossible partnership</font></p>
 Divine Science is absolute, and permits no half-way
 position in learning its Principle and rule--establishing
 it by demonstration. The conventional firm,
 called matter and mind, God never formed.
 Science and understanding, governed by the unerring and
 eternal Mind, destroy the imaginary copartnership, matter
 and mind, formed only to be destroyed in a manner and
 at a period as yet unknown. This suppositional partnership is already obsolete, for matter, examined in the light
 of divine metaphysics, disappears.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_275"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 275</font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Spirit the starting-point</font></p>
 Matter has no life to lose, and Spirit never dies. A
 partnership of mind with matter would ignore omnipresent and omnipotent Mind. This shows that
 matter did not originate in God, Spirit, and is
 not eternal. Therefore matter is neither substantial, living,
 nor intelligent. The starting-point of divine Science is
 that God, Spirit, is All-in-all, and that there is no other
 might nor Mind,--that God is Love, and therefore He
 is divine Principle.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Divine synonyms</font></p>
 To grasp the reality and order of being in its Science,
 you must begin by reckoning God as the divine Principle
 of all that really is. Spirit, Life, Truth, Love,
 combine as one,--and are the Scriptural names
 for God. All substance, intelligence, wisdom, being, immortality, cause, and effect belong to God. These are
 His attributes, the eternal manifestations of the infinite
 divine Principle, Love. No wisdom is wise but His
 wisdom; no truth is true, no love is lovely, no life is Life
 but the divine; no good is, but the good God bestows.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The divine completeness</font></p>
 Divine metaphysics, as revealed to spiritual understanding, shows clearly that all is Mind, and that Mind is
 God, omnipotence, omnipresence, omniscience,
 - that is, all power, all presence, all Science.
 Hence all is in reality the manifestation of Mind.
 <p></p><p>Our material human theories are destitute of Science.
 The true understanding of God is spiritual. It robs the
 grave of victory. It destroys the false evidence that misleads thought and points to other gods, or other so-called
 powers, such as matter, disease, sin, and death, superior
 or contrary to the one Spirit.
 </p><p></p><p>Truth, spiritually discerned, is scientifically understood.
 It casts out error and heals the sick.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_276"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 276</font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Universal brotherhood</font></p>
 Having one God, one Mind, unfolds the power that
 heals the sick, and fulfils these sayings of Scripture, "I
 am the Lord that healeth thee," and "I have
 found a ransom." When the divine precepts
 are understood, they unfold the foundation of fellowship,
 in which one mind is not at war with another, but all have
 one Spirit, God, one intelligent source, in accordance with
 the Scriptural command: "Let this Mind be in you,
 which was also in Christ Jesus." Man and his Maker
 are correlated in divine Science, and real consciousness
 is cognizant only of the things of God.
 <p></p><p>The realization that all inharmony is unreal brings
 objects and thoughts into human view in their true light,
 and presents them as beautiful and immortal. Harmony
 in man is as real and immortal as in music. Discord is
 unreal and mortal.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Perfection requisite</font></p>
 If God is admitted to be the only Mind and Life,
 there ceases to be any opportunity for sin and death.
 When we learn in Science how to be perfect
 even as our Father in heaven is perfect,
 thought is turned into new and healthy channels, towards the contemplation of things immortal and away
 from materiality to the Principle of the universe, including harmonious man.
 <p></p><p>Material beliefs and spiritual understanding never
 mingle. The latter destroys the former. Discord is the
 nothingness named error. Harmony is the somethingness
 named Truth.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Like evolving like</font></p>
 Nature and revelation inform us that like produces
 like. Divine Science does not gather grapes
 from thorns nor figs from thistles.   Intelligence never produces non-intelligence; but matter is
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_277"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 277</font></a></p><p></p><p>ever non-intelligent and therefore cannot spring from
 intelligence. To all that is unlike unerring and eternal
 Mind, this Mind saith, "Thou shalt surely die;" and elsewhere the Scripture says that dust returns to dust. The
 non-intelligent relapses into its own unreality.  Matter
 never produces mind. The immortal never produces the
 mortal. Good cannot result in evil. As God Himself is
 good and is Spirit, goodness and spirituality must be immortal. Their opposites, evil and matter, are mortal
 error, and error has no creator. If goodness and spirituality are real, evil and materiality are unreal and cannot be the outcome of an infinite God, good.
 </p><p></p><p>Natural history presents vegetables and animals as
 preserving their original species,--like reproducing like.
 A mineral is not produced by a vegetable nor the man
 by the brute. In reproduction, the order of genus and
 species is preserved throughout the entire round of nature.
 This points to the spiritual truth and Science of being.
 Error relies upon a reversal of this order, asserts that
 Spirit produces matter and matter produces all the ills
 of flesh, and therefore that good is the origin of evil.
 These suppositions contradict even the order of material
 so-called science.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Material error</font></p>
 The realm of the real is Spirit. The unlikeness of Spirit
 is matter, and the opposite of the real is not divine,--it is
 a human concept. Matter is an error of statement. This error in the premise leads to errors
 in the conclusion in every statement into which it enters.
 Nothing we can say or believe regarding matter is immortal, for matter is temporal and is therefore a mortal phenomenon, a human concept, sometimes beautiful, always
 erroneous.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_278"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 278</font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Substance versus supposition</font></p>
 Is Spirit the source or creator of matter? Science reveals nothing in Spirit out of which to create matter.
 Divine metaphysics explains away matter.
 Spirit is the only substance and consciousness
 recognized by divine Science. The material
 senses oppose this, but there are no material senses, for
 matter has no mind. In Spirit there is no matter, even
 as in Truth there is no error, and in good no evil. It is
 a false supposition, the notion that there is real substancematter, the opposite of Spirit. Spirit, God, is infinite,
 all. Spirit can have no opposite.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">One cause supreme</font></p>
 That matter is substantial or has life and sensation, is
 one of the false beliefs of mortals, and exists only in a
 supposititious mortal consciousness. Hence,
 as we approach Spirit and Truth, we lose the
 consciousness of matter. The admission that there can
 be material substance requires another admission, namely, that Spirit is not infinite and that matter is selfcreative, self-existent, and eternal. From this it would
 follow that there are two eternal causes, warring forever
 with each other; and yet we say that Spirit is supreme
 and all-presence.
 <p></p><p>The belief of the eternity of matter contradicts the
 demonstration of life as Spirit, and leads to the conclusion that if man is material, he originated in matter and
 must return to dust, - logic which would prove his annihilation.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Substance is Spirit</font></p>
 All that we term sin, sickness, and death is a mortal
 belief. We define matter as error, because it is the opposite of life, substance, and intelligence. Matter, with its mortality, cannot be substantial
 if Spirit is substantial and eternal. Which ought to
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_279"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 279</font></a></p><p></p><p>be substance to us,--the erring, changing, and dying,
 the mutable and mortal, or the unerring, immutable,
 and immortal? A New Testament writer plainly describes faith, a quality of mind, as "the substance of things
 hoped for."
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Material mortality</font></p>
 The doom of matter establishes the conclusion that
 matter, slime, or protoplasm never originated
 in the immortal Mind, and is therefore not
 eternal. Matter is neither created by Mind nor for the
 manifestation and support of Mind.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Spiritual tangibility</font></p>
 Ideas are tangible and real to immortal consciousness,
 and they have the advantage of being eternal.
 Spirit and matter can neither coexist nor cooperate, and one can no more create the other than
 Truth can create error, or vice versa.
 <p></p><p>In proportion as the belief disappears that life and intelligence are in or of matter, the immortal facts of
 being are seen, and their only idea or intelligence is
 in God. Spirit is reached only through the understanding and demonstration of eternal Life and Truth and
 Love.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Pantheistic tendencies</font></p>
 Every system of human philosophy, doctrine, and
 medicine is more or less infected with the pantheistic
 belief that there is mind in matter; but this
 belief contradicts alike revelation and right
 reasoning. A logical and scientific conclusion is reached
 only through the knowledge that there are not two
 bases of being, matter and mind, but one alone, Mind.
 <p></p><p>Pantheism, starting from a material sense of God,
 seeks cause in effect, Principle in its idea, and life and
 intelligence in matter.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_280"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 280</font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The things of God are beautiful</font></p>
 In the infinitude of Mind, matter must be unknown.
 Symbols and elements of discord and decay are not products of the infinite, perfect, and eternal All.
 From Love and from the light and harmony
 which are the abode of Spirit, only reflections
 of good can come. All things beautiful and harmless are
 ideas of Mind. Mind creates and multiplies them, and
 the product must be mental.
 <p></p><p>Finite belief can never do justice to Truth in any direction. Finite belief limits all things, and would compress
 Mind, which is infinite, beneath a skull bone. Such belief can neither apprehend nor worship the infinite; and
 to accommodate its finite sense of the divisibility of Soul
 and substance, it seeks to divide the one Spirit into persons and souls.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Belief in many gods</font></p>
 Through this error, human belief comes to have "gods
 many and lords many." Moses declared as Jehovah's
 first command of the Ten: "Thou shalt have
 no other gods before me!" But behold the
 zeal of belief to establish the opposite error of many
 minds. The argument of the serpent in the allegory, "Ye
 shall be as gods," urges through every avenue the belief
 that Soul is in body, and that infinite Spirit, and Life, is
 in finite forms.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Sensationless body</font></p>
 Rightly understood, instead of possessing a sentient
 material form, man has a sensationless body; and God,
 the Soul of man and of all existence, being
 perpetual in His own individuality, harmony,
 and immortality, imparts and perpetuates these qualities
 in man,--through Mind, not matter. The only excuse
 for entertaining human opinions and rejecting the Science
 of being is our mortal ignorance of Spirit,--ignorance
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_281"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 281</font></a></p><p></p><p>which yields only to the understanding of divine Science,
 the understanding by which we enter into the kingdom
 of Truth on earth and learn that Spirit is infinite and
 supreme. Spirit and matter no more commingle than
 light and darkness. When one appears, the other disappears.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">God and His image</font></p>
 Error presupposes man to be both mind and matter.
 Divine Science contradicts the corporeal senses, rebukes
 mortal belief, and asks: What is the Ego,
 whence its origin and what its destiny? The
 Ego-man is the reflection of the Ego-God; the Ego-man
 is the image and likeness of perfect Mind, Spirit, divine
 Principle.
 <p></p><p>The one Ego, the one Mind or Spirit called God, is
 infinite individuality, which supplies all form and comeliness and which reflects reality and divinity in individual
 spiritual man and things.
 </p><p></p><p>The mind supposed to exist in matter or beneath a
 skull bone is a myth, a misconceived sense and false
 conception as to man and Mind. When we put off the
 false sense for the true, and see that sin and mortality
 have neither Principle nor permanency, we shall learn
 that sin and mortality are without actual origin or rightful existence. They are native nothingness, out of which
 error would simulate creation through a man formed from
 dust.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The true new idea</font></p>
 Divine Science does not put new wine into old bottles,
 Soul into matter, nor the infinite into the finite. Our
 false views of matter perish as we grasp
 the facts of Spirit. The old belief must be
 cast out or the new idea will be spilled, and the inspiration, which is to change our standpoint, will be
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_282"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 282</font></a></p><p></p><p>lost. Now, as of old, Truth casts out evils and heals
 the sick.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Figures of being</font></p>
 The real Life, or Mind, and its opposite, the so-called
 material life and mind, are figured by two geometrical
 symbols, a circle or sphere and a straight
 line. The circle represents the infinite without beginning or end; the straight line represents the
 finite, which has both beginning and end. The sphere
 represents good, the self-existent and eternal individuality
 or Mind; the straight line represents evil, a belief in
 a self-made and temporary material existence. Eternal
 Mind and temporary material existence never unite in
 figure or in fact.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Opposite symbols</font></p>
 A straight line finds no abiding-place in a curve, and a
 curve finds no adjustment to a straight line. Similarly,
 matter has no place in Spirit, and Spirit has
 no place in matter. Truth has no home in
 error, and error has no foothold in Truth. Mind cannot
 pass into non-intelligence and matter, nor can non-intelligence become Soul. At no point can these opposites
 mingle or unite. Even though they seem to touch, one
 is still a curve and the other a straight line.
 <p></p><p>There is no inherent power in matter; for all that is
 material is a material, human, mortal thought, always
 governing itself erroneously.
 </p><p></p><p>Truth is the intelligence of immortal Mind. Error is
 the so-called intelligence of mortal mind.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Truth is not inverted</font></p>
 Whatever indicates the fall of man or the opposite of
 God or God's absence, is the Adam-dream, which is neither
 Mind nor man, for it is not begotten of the
 Father. The rule of inversion infers from
 error its opposite, Truth; but Truth is the light which
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_283"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 283</font></a></p><p></p><p>dispels error. As mortals begin to understand Spirit,
 they give up the belief that there is any true existence
 apart from God.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Source of all life and action</font></p>
 Mind is the source of all movement, and there is no
 inertia to retard or check its perpetual and harmonious
 action. Mind is the same Life, Love, and wisdom "yesterday, and to-day, and forever."
 Matter and its effects--sin, sickness, and
 death--are states of mortal mind which act, react, and
 then come to a stop. They are not facts of Mind. They
 are not ideas, but illusions. Principle is absolute. It
 admits of no error, but rests upon understanding.
 <p></p><p>But what say prevalent theories? They insist  that
 Life, or God, is one and the same with material life socalled. They speak of both Truth and error as mind,
 and of good and evil as spirit. They claim that to be
 life which is but the objective state of material sense, such as the structural life of the tree and of material
 man,--and deem this the manifestation of the one Life,
 God.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Spiritual structure</font></p>
 This false belief as to what really constitutes life so
 detracts from God's character and nature, that the true
 sense of His power is lost to all who cling to
 this falsity. The divine Principle, or Life, cannot be practically demonstrated in length of days, as it
 was by the patriarchs, unless its Science be accurately
 stated. We must receive the divine Principle in the understanding, and live it in daily life; and unless we so do, we
 can no more demonstrate Science, than we can teach and
 illustrate geometry by calling a curve a straight line or a
 straight line a sphere.
 <p></p><p>Are mentality, immortality, consciousness, resident in
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_284"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 284</font></a></p><p></p><p>matter? It is not rational to say that Mind is infinite,
 but dwells in finiteness,--in matter,--or that matter is
 infinite and the medium of Mind.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mind never limited</font></p>
 If God were limited to man or matter, or if the infinite
 could be circumscribed within the finite, God would be
 corporeal, and unlimited Mind would seem
 to spring from a limited body; but this is an
 impossibility. Infinite Mind can have no starting-point,
 and can return to no limit. It can never be in bonds,
 nor be fully manifested through corporeality.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Material recognition impossible</font></p>
 Is God's image or likeness matter, or a mortal, sin,
 sickness, and death? Can matter recognize Mind?
 Can infinite Mind recognize matter? Can the
 infinite dwell in the finite or know aught unlike the infinite?  Can Deity be known through
 the material senses? Can the material senses, which receive no direct evidence of Spirit, give correct testimony
 as to spiritual life, truth, and love?
 <p></p><p>The answer to all these questions must forever be in
 the negative.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Our physical insensibility to Spirit</font></p>
 The physical senses can obtain no proof of God. They
 can neither see Spirit through the eye nor hear it through
 the ear, nor can they feel, taste, or smell Spirit.
 Even the more subtile and misnamed material elements are beyond the cognizance
 of these senses, and are known only by the effects commonly attributed to them.
 <p></p><p>According to Christian Science, the only real senses
 of man are spiritual, emanating from divine Mind.
 Thought passes from God to man, but neither sensation
 nor report goes from material body to Mind. The intercommunication is always from God to His idea, man.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_285"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 285</font></a></p><p></p><p>Matter is not sentient and cannot be cognizant of good
 or of evil, of pleasure or of pain. Man's individuality is not material. This Science of being obtains not
 alone hereafter in what men call Paradise, but here
 and now; it is the great fact of being for time and
 eternity.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The human counterfeit</font></p>
 What, then, is the material personality which suffers,
 sins, and dies? It is not man, the image and likeness
 of God, but man's counterfeit, the inverted
 likeness, the unlikeness called sin, sickness,
 and death. The unreality of the claim that a mortal is
 the true image of God is illustrated by the opposite natures of Spirit and matter, Mind and body, for one is
 intelligence while the other is non-intelligence.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Material misconceptions</font></p>
 Is God a physical personality? Spirit is not physical.
 The belief that a material body is man is a false conception of man. The time has come for a
 finite conception of the infinite and of a material body as the seat of Mind to give place
 to a diviner sense of intelligence and its manifestations,
 to the better understanding that Science gives of the
 Supreme Being, or divine Principle, and idea.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Salvation is through reform</font></p>
 By interpreting God as a corporeal Saviour but not as
 the saving Principle, or divine Love, we shall continue
 to seek salvation through pardon and not
 through reform, and resort to matter instead
 of Spirit for the cure of the sick. As mortals
 reach, through knowledge of Christian Science, a higher
 sense, they will seek to learn, not from matter, but from
 the divine Principle, God, how to demonstrate the Christ,
 Truth, as the healing and saving power.
 <p></p><p>It is essential to understand, instead of believe, what
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_286"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 286</font></a></p><p></p><p>relates most nearly to the happiness of being. To seek
 Truth through belief in a human doctrine is not to understand the infinite. We must not seek the immutable
 and immortal through the finite, mutable, and mortal,
 and so depend upon belief instead of demonstration, for
 this is fatal to a knowledge of Science. The understanding of Truth gives full faith in Truth, and spiritual understanding is better than all burnt offerings.
 </p><p></p><p>The Master said, "No man cometh unto the Father
 [the divine Principle of being] but by me," Christ,
 Life, Truth, Love; for Christ says, "I am the way."
 Physical causation was put aside from first to
 last by this original man, Jesus. He knew that the
 divine. Principle, Love, creates and governs all that
 is real.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Goodness a portion of God</font></p>
 In the Saxon and twenty other tongues good is the term
 for God. The Scriptures declare all that He
 made to be good, like Himself,--good in
 Principle and in idea. Therefore the spiritual
 universe is good, and reflects God as He is.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Spiritual thoughts</font></p>
 God's thoughts are perfect and eternal, are substance
 and Life. Material and temporal thoughts are human,
 involving error, and since God, Spirit, is the
 only cause, they lack a divine cause. The
 temporal and material are not then creations of Spirit.
 They are but counterfeits of the spiritual and eternal.
 Transitory thoughts are the antipodes of everlasting
 Truth, though (by the supposition of opposite qualities)
 error must also say, "I am true." But by this saying
 error, the lie, destroys itself.
 <p></p><p>Sin, sickness, and death are comprised in human material belief, and belong not to the divine Mind. They
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_287"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 287</font></a></p><p></p><p>are without a real origin or existence. They have neither
 Principle nor permanence, but belong, with all that is
 material and temporal, to the nothingness of error, which
 simulates the creations of Truth. All creations of Spirit
 are eternal; but creations of matter must return to dust.
 Error supposes man to be both mental and material.
 Divine Science contradicts this postulate and maintains
 man's spiritual identity.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Divine allness</font></p>
 We call the absence of Truth, error. Truth and error
 are unlike. In Science, Truth is divine, and the infinite
 God can have no unlikeness. Did God, Truth,
 create error? No! "Doth a fountain send
 forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?" God
 being everywhere and all-inclusive, how can He be absent
 or suggest the absence of omnipresence and omnipotence?
 How can there be more than all?
 <p></p><p>Neither understanding nor truth accompanies error,
 nor is error the offshoot of Mind. Evil calls itself something, when it is nothing. It saith, "I am man, but I am
 not the image and likeness of God;" whereas the Scriptures declare that man was made in God's likeness.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Error unveiled</font></p>
 Error is false, mortal belief; it is illusion, without spiritual identity or foundation, and it has no real existence.
 The supposition that life, substance, and intelligence are in matter, or of it, is an error.
 Matter is neither a thing nor a person, but merely the
 objective supposition of Spirit's opposite. The five material senses testify to truth and error as united in a mind
 both good and evil. Their false evidence will finally
 yield to Truth,--to the recognition of Spirit and of the
 spiritual creation.
 <p></p><p>Truth cannot be contaminated by error. The state</p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_288"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 288</font></a></p><p></p><p>ment that Truth is real necessarily includes the correlated
 statement, that error, Truth's unlikeness, is unreal.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The great conflict</font></p>
 The suppositional warfare between truth and error is
 only the mental conflict between the evidence of the spiritual senses and the testimony of the material
 senses, and this warfare between the Spirit and
 flesh will settle all questions through faith in and the understanding of divine Love.
 <p></p><p>Superstition and understanding can never combine.
 When the final physical and moral effects of Christian
 Science are fully apprehended, the conflict between truth
 and error, understanding and belief, Science and material
 sense, foreshadowed by the prophets and inaugurated
 by Jesus, will cease, and spiritual harmony reign. The
 lightnings and thunderbolts of error may burst and flash
 till the cloud is cleared and the tumult dies away in the
 distance. Then the raindrops of divinity refresh the
 earth. As St. Paul says: "There remaineth therefore
 a rest to the people of God" (of Spirit).
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The chief stones in the temple</font></p>
 The chief stones in the temple of Christian Science are
 to be found in the following postulates: that Life is God,
 good, and not evil; that Soul is sinless, not
 to be found in the body; that Spirit is not, and
 cannot be, materialized; that Life is not subject
 to death; that the spiritual real man has no birth, no material life, and no death.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The Christ-element</font></p>
 Science reveals the glorious possibilities of immortal
 man, forever unlimited by the mortal senses.
 The Christ-element in the Messiah made him
 the Way-shower, Truth and Life.
 <p></p><p>The eternal Truth destroys what mortals seem to have
 learned from error, and man's real existence as a child
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_289"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 289</font></a></p><p></p><p>of God comes to light. Truth demonstrated is eternal
 life. Mortal man can never rise from the temporal debris
 of error, belief in sin, sickness, and death, until he learns
 that God is the only Life. The belief that life and sensation are in the body should be overcome by the understanding of what constitutes man as the image of God.
 Then Spirit will have overcome the flesh.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Wickedness is not man</font></p>
 A wicked mortal is not the idea of God. He is little
 else than the expression of error. To suppose that sin,
 lust, hatred, envy, hypocrisy, revenge, have life
 abiding in them, is a terrible mistake. Life
 and life's idea, Truth and Truth's idea, never make men
 sick, sinful, or mortal.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Death but an illusion</font></p>
 The fact that the Christ, or Truth, overcame and still
 overcomes death proves the "king of terrors" to be but
 a mortal belief, or error, which Truth destroys
 with the spiritual evidences of Life; and this
 shows that what appears to the senses to be death is but a
 mortal illusion, for to the real man and the real universe
 there is no death-process.
 <p></p><p>The belief that matter has life results, by the universal
 law of mortal mind, in a belief in death. So man, tree,
 and flower are supposed to die; but the fact remains,
 that God's universe is spiritual and immortal.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Spiritual offspring</font></p>
 The spiritual fact and the material belief of things are
 contradictions; but the spiritual is true, and therefore the
 material must be untrue. Life is not in matter.
 Therefore it cannot be said to pass out of matter. Matter and death are mortal illusions. Spirit and
 all things spiritual are the real and eternal.
 <p></p><p>Man is not the offspring of flesh, but of Spirit,--of
 Life, not of matter. Because Life is God, Life must be
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_290"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 290</font></a></p><p></p><p>eternal, self-existent. Life is the everlasting I AM, the Being who was and is and shall be, whom nothing can erase.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Death no advantage</font></p>
 If the Principle, rule, and demonstration of man's being
 are not in the least understood before what is termed death
 overtakes mortals, they will rise no higher spiritually in the scale of existence on account of
 that single experience, but will remain as material as before the transition, still seeking happiness through a material, instead of through a spiritual sense of life, and from
 selfish and inferior motives. That Life or Mind is finite
 and physical or is manifested through brain and nerves,
 is false. Hence Truth comes to destroy this error and
 its effects,--sickness, sin, and death. To the spiritual
 class, relates the Scripture: "On such the second death
 hath no power."
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Future purification</font></p>
 If the change called death destroyed the belief in sin,
 sickness, and death, happiness would be won at the moment of dissolution, and be forever permanent;
 but this is not so. Perfection is gained only
 by perfection. They who are unrighteous shall be unrighteous still, until in divine Science Christ, Truth, removes all ignorance and sin.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Sin is punished</font></p>
 The sin and error which possess us at the instant of
 death do not cease at that moment, but endure until the
 death of these errors. To be wholly spiritual,
 man must be sinless, and he becomes thus only
 when he reaches perfection. The murderer, though slain
 in the act, does not thereby forsake sin. He is no more
 spiritual for believing that his body died and learning that
 his cruel mind died not. His thoughts are no purer until
 evil is disarmed by good. His body is as material as his
 mind, and vice versa.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_291"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 291</font></a></p><p></p><p>The suppositions that sin is pardoned while unforsaken, that happiness can be genuine in the midst of
 sin, that the so-called death of the body frees from sin,
 and that God's pardon is aught but the destruction of
 sin,--these are grave mistakes. We know that all will
 be changed "in the twinkling of an eye," when the last
 trump shall sound; but this last call of wisdom cannot
 come till mortals have already yielded to each lesser call
 in the growth of Christian character. Mortals need not
 fancy that belief in the experience of death will awaken
 them to glorified being.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Salvation and probation</font></p>
 Universal salvation rests on progression and probation,
 and is unattainable without them. Heaven is not a locality, but a divine state of Mind in which all the
 manifestations of Mind are harmonious and
 immortal, because sin is not there and man is
 found having no righteousness of his own, but in possession of "the mind of the Lord," as the Scripture says.
 <p>"In the place where the tree falleth, there it shall
 be." So we read in Ecclesiastes. This text has been
 transformed into the popular proverb, "As the tree
 falls, so it must lie." As man falleth asleep, so shall he
 awake. As death findeth mortal man, so shall he be
 after death, until probation and growth shall effect the
 needed change. Mind never becomes dust. No resurrection from the grave awaits Mind or Life, for the grave
 has no power over either.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Day of judgment</font></p>
 No final judgment awaits mortals, for the judgmentday of wisdom comes hourly and continually,
 even the judgment by which mortal man is divested of all material error. As for spiritual error there
 is none.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_292"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 292</font></a></p><p></p><p>When the last mortal fault is destroyed, then the final
 trump will sound which will end the battle of Truth with
 error and mortality; "but of that day and hour, knoweth
 no man." Here prophecy pauses. Divine Science alone
 can compass the heights and depths of being and reveal
 the infinite.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Primitive error</font></p>
 Truth will be to us "the resurrection and the life" only
 as it destroys all error and the belief that Mind, the only
 immortality of man, can be fettered by the
 body, and Life be controlled by death. A sinful, sick, and dying mortal is not the likeness of God, the
 perfect and eternal.
 <p></p><p>Matter is the primitive belief of mortal mind, because
 this so-called mind has no cognizance of Spirit. To
 mortal mind, matter is substantial,  and evil is
 real. The so-called senses of mortals are material.
 Hence the so-called life of mortals is dependent on
 matter.
 </p><p></p><p>Explaining the origin of material man and mortal mind,
 Jesus said: "Why do ye not understand my speech?
 Even because ye cannot hear my word. Ye are of your
 father, the devil [evil], and the lusts of your father ye will
 do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode
 not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When
 he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar,
 and the father of it."
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Immortal man</font></p>
 This carnal material mentality, misnamed mind, is
 mortal. Therefore man would be annihilated, were it
 not for the spiritual real man's indissoluble
 connection with his God, which Jesus brought
 to light. In his resurrection and ascension, Jesus showed
 that a mortal man is not the real essence of manhood, and
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_293"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 293</font></a></p><p></p><p>that this unreal material mortality disappears in presence
 of the reality.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Elementary electricity</font></p>
 Electricity is not a vital fluid, but the least material
 form of illusive consciousness, - the material mindlessness, which forms no link between matter and
 Mind, and which destroys itself. Matter and
 mortal mind are but different strata of human belief. The
 grosser substratum is named matter or body; the more
 ethereal is called mind. This so-called mind and body
 is the illusion called a mortal, a mind in matter. In reality
 and in Science, both strata, mortal mind and mortal body,
 are false representatives of man.
 <p></p><p>The material so-called gases and forces are counterfeits of the spiritual forces of divine Mind, whose potency
 is Truth, whose attraction is Love, whose adhesion and
 cohesion are Life, perpetuating the eternal facts of being.
 Electricity is the sharp surplus of materiality which counterfeits the true essence of spirituality or truth,--the
 great difference being that electricity is not intelligent,
 while spiritual truth is Mind.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The counterfeit forces</font></p>
 There is no vapid fury of mortal mind--expressed in
 earthquake, wind, wave, lightning, fire, bestial ferocity
 - and this so-called mind is self-destroyed.
 The manifestations of evil, which counterfeit
 divine justice, are called in the Scriptures, "The anger
 of the Lord." In reality, they show the self-destruction
 of error or matter and point to matter's opposite, the
 strength and permanency of Spirit. Christian Science
 brings to light Truth and its supremacy, universal harmony, the entireness of God, good, and the nothingness
 of evil.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Instruments of error</font></p>
 The five physical senses are the avenues and instru<p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_294"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 294</font></a></p><p></p><p>ments of human error, and they correspond with error.
 These senses indicate the common human belief, that life,
 substance, and intelligence are a unison of
 matter with Spirit. This is pantheism, and
 carries within itself the seeds of all error.
 </p><p></p><p>If man is both mind and matter, the loss of one finger
 would take away some quality and quantity of the man,
 for matter and man would be one.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mortal verdict</font></p>
 The belief that matter thinks, sees, or feels is not more
 real than the belief that matter enjoys and suffers. This
 mortal belief, misnamed man, is error, saying:
 "Matter has intelligence and sensation. Nerves
 feel. Brain thinks and sins. The stomach can make a
 man cross. Injury can cripple and matter can kill man."
 This verdict of the so-called material senses victimizes
 mortals, taught, as they are by physiology and pathology,
 to revere false testimony, even the errors that are destroyed
 by Truth through spiritual sense and Science.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mythical pleasure</font></p>
 The lines of demarcation between immortal man, representing Spirit, and mortal man, representing the error that
 life and intelligence are in matter, show the
 pleasures and pains of matter to be myths, and
 human belief in them to be the father of mythology, in
 which matter is represented as divided into intelligent gods.
 Man's genuine selfhood is recognizable only in what is
 good and true. Man is neither self-made nor made by
 mortals. God created man.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Severed members</font></p>
 The inebriate believes that there is pleasure in intoxication. The thief believes that he gains something by stealing, and the hypocrite that he is hiding himself. The
 Science of Mind corrects such mistakes, for Truth demonstrates the falsity of error.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_295"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 295</font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Severed members</font></p>
 The belief that a severed limb is aching in the old location, the sensation seeming to be in nerves which 
 are no longer there, is an added proof of the unreliability of physical testimony.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mortals unlike immortals</font></p>
 God creates and governs the universe, including man.
 The universe is filled with spiritual ideas, which He
 evolves, and they are obedient to the Mind
 that makes them. Mortal mind would transform the spiritual into the material, and then
 recover man's original self in order to escape from the
 mortality of this error. Mortals are not like immortals,
 created in God's own image; but infinite Spirit being all,
 mortal consciousness will at last yield to the scientific fact
 and disappear, and the real sense of being, perfect and
 forever intact, will appear.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Goodness transparent</font></p>
 The manifestation of God through mortals is as light
 passing through the window-pane. The light and the
 glass never mingle, but as matter, the glass
 is less opaque than the walls.  The mortal
 mind through which Truth appears most vividly is that
 one which has lost much materiality--much error--in
 order to become a better transparency for Truth. Then,
 like a cloud melting into thin vapor, it no longer hides
 the sun.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Brainology a myth</font></p>
 All that is called mortal thought is made up of error.
 The theoretical mind is matter, named brain, or material consciousness, the exact opposite of real 
 Mind, or Spirit. Brainology teaches that 
 mortals are created to suffer and die. It further
 teaches that when man is dead, his immortal soul is
 resurrected from death and mortality. Thus error theorizes that spirit is born of matter and returns to mat<p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_296"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 296</font></a></p><p></p><p>ter, and that man has a resurrection from dust; whereas
 Science unfolds the eternal verity, that man is the spiritual,
 eternal reflection of God.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Scientific purgation</font></p>
 Progress is born of experience. It is the ripening of
 mortal man, through which the mortal is dropped for
 the immortal. Either here or hereafter, suffering or Science must destroy all illusions
 regarding life and mind, and regenerate material sense
 and self. The old man with his deeds must be put off.
 Nothing sensual or sinful is immortal. The death of a
 false material sense and of sin, not the death of organic
 matter, is what reveals man and Life, harmonious, real,
 and eternal.
 <p></p><p>The so-called pleasures and pains of matter perish,
 and they must go out under the blaze of Truth, spiritual
 sense, and the actuality of being. Mortal belief must lose
 all satisfaction in error and sin in order to part with
 them.
 </p><p></p><p>Whether mortals will learn this sooner or later, and
 how long they will suffer the pangs of destruction, depends upon the tenacity of error.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mixed testimony</font></p>
 The knowledge obtained from the corporeal senses
 leads to sin and death. When the evidence of Spirit
 and matter, Truth and error, seems to commingle, it rests upon foundations which time
 is wearing away. Mortal mind judges by the testimony
 of the material senses, until Science obliterates this false
 testimony. An improved belief is one step out of error,
 and aids in taking the next step and in understanding
 the situation in Christian Science.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Belief an autocrat</font></p>
 Mortal belief is a liar from the beginning, not deserving
 power. It says to mortals, "You are wretched!" and they
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_297"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 297</font></a></p><p></p><p>think they are so; and nothing can change this state, until
 the belief changes. Mortal belief says, "You are happy!"
 and mortals are so; and no circumstance can
 alter the situation, until the belief on this subject changes. Human belief says to mortals, "You are
 sick!" and this testimony manifests itself on the body as
 sickness. It is as necessary for a health-illusion, as for
 an illusion of sickness, to be instructed out of itself into
 the understanding of what constitutes health; for a change 
 in either a health-belief or a belief in sickness affects the
 physical condition.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Self-improvement</font></p>
 Erroneous belief is destroyed by truth. Change the 
 evidence, and that disappears which before seemed real
 to this false belief, and the human consciousness rises higher. Thus the reality of being
 is attained and man found to be immortal. The only
 fact concerning any material concept is, that it is neither
 scientific nor eternal, but subject to change and dissolution.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Faith higher than belief</font></p>
 Faith is higher and more spiritual than belief. It is
 a chrysalis state of human thought, in which spiritual
 evidence, contradicting the testimony of material sense, begins to appear, and Truth, the
 ever-present, is becoming understood. Human thoughts
 have their degrees of comparison. Some thoughts are
 better than others. A belief in Truth is better than a
 belief in error, but no mortal testimony is founded on the 
 divine rock. Mortal testimony can be shaken. Until
 belief becomes faith, and faith becomes spiritual understanding, human thought has little relation to the actual
 or divine.
 <p></p><p>A mortal belief fulfils its own conditions. Sickness,
 </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_298%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 298 </font></a></p><p></p><p>sin, and death are the vague realities of human conclusions. Life, Truth, and Love are the realities of divine
 Science. They dawn in faith and glow full-orbed in
 spiritual understanding. As a cloud hides the sun it
 cannot extinguish, so false belief silences for a while the
 voice of immutable harmony, but false belief cannot destroy Science armed with faith, hope, and fruition.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Truth's witness</font></p>
 What is termed material sense can report only a mortal temporary sense of things, whereas spiritual sense can
 bear witness only to Truth. To material sense,
 the unreal is the real until this sense is corrected
 by Christian Science.
 <p></p><p>Spiritual sense, contradicting the material senses, involves intuition, hope, faith, understanding, fruition, reality. Material sense expresses the belief that mind is in
 matter. This human belief, alternating between a sense
 of pleasure and pain, hope and fear, life and death, never
 reaches beyond the boundary of the mortal or the unreal.
 When the real is attained, which is announced by Science,
 joy is no longer a trembler, nor is hope a cheat. Spiritual ideas, like numbers and notes, start from Principle,
 and admit no materialistic beliefs. Spiritual ideas lead
 up to their divine origin, God, and to the spiritual sense
 of being.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Thought-angels</font></p>
 Angels are not etherealized human beings, evolving
 animal qualities in their wings; but they are celestial
 visitants, flying on spiritual, not material,
 pinions. Angels are pure thoughts from God,
 winged with Truth and Love, no matter what their individualism may be. Human conjecture confers upon angels
 its own forms of thought, marked with superstitious outlines, making them human creatures with suggestive
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_299"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 299</font></a></p><p></p><p>feathers; but this is only fancy. It has behind it no more
 reality than has the sculptor's thought when he carves
 his "Statue of Liberty," which embodies his conception of an unseen quality or condition, but which has
 no physical antecedent reality save in the artist's own observation and "chambers of imagery."
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Our Angelic messengers</font></p>
 My angels are exalted thoughts, appearing at the door
 of some sepulchre, in which human belief has buried
 its fondest earthly hopes. With white fingers they point upward to a new and glorified trust, to higher ideals of life and its joys. Angels
 are God's representatives. These upward-soaring beings 
 never lead towards self, sin, or materiality, but guide to
 the divine Principle of all good, whither every real individuality, image, or likeness of God, gathers. By giving
 earnest heed to these spiritual guides they tarry with us,
 and we entertain "angels unawares."
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Knowledge and Truth</font></p>
 Knowledge gained from material sense is figuratively
 represented in Scripture as a tree, bearing the fruits of
 sin, sickness, and death. Ought we not then
 to judge the knowledge thus obtained to be
 untrue and dangerous, since "the tree is known by his
 fruit"?
 <p></p><p>Truth never destroys God's idea. Truth is spiritual,
 eternal substance, which cannot destroy the right reflection. Corporeal sense, or error, may seem to hide Truth,
 health, harmony, and Science, as the mist obscures the
 sun or the mountain; but Science, the sunshine of Truth,
 will melt away the shadow and reveal the celestial
 peaks.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Old and new man</font></p>
 If man were solely a creature of the material senses,
 he would have no eternal Principle and would be mutable
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_300"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 300</font></a></p><p></p><p>and mortal. Human logic is awry when it attempts
 to draw correct spiritual conclusions regarding life from
 matter. Finite sense has no true appreciation of infinite Principle, God, or of His infinite image or reflection, man. The mirage, which makes
 trees and cities seem to be where they are not, illustrates
 the illusion of material man, who cannot be the image
 of God.
 </p><p></p><p>So far as the scientific statement as to man is understood, it can be proved and will bring to light the true
 reflection of God--the real man, or the new man (as
 St. Paul has it).
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The tares and wheat</font></p>
 The temporal and unreal never touch the eternal and
 real. The mutable and imperfect never touch the immutable and perfect. The inharmonious and
 self-destructive never touch the harmonious
 and self-existent. These opposite qualities are the tares
 and wheat, which never really mingle, though (to mortal
 sight) they grow side by side until the harvest; then, Science separates the wheat from the tares, through the realization of God as ever present and of man as reflecting
 the divine likeness.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The divine reflection</font></p>
 Spirit is God, Soul; therefore Soul is not in matter. If
 Spirit were in matter, God would have no representative,
 and matter would be identical with God.
 The theory that soul, spirit, intelligence, inhabits matter is taught by the schools. This theory is
 unscientific. The universe reflects and expresses the divine substance or Mind; therefore God is seen only in the
 spiritual universe and spiritual man, as the sun is seen in
 the ray of light which goes out from it. God is revealed only in that which reflects Life, Truth, Love, <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_301"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 301</font></a></p><p></p><p>yea, which manifests God's attributes and power, even
 as the human likeness thrown upon the mirror, repeats
 the color, form, and action of the person in front of the
 mirror.
 </p><p></p><p>Few persons comprehend what Christian Science
 means by the word reflection. To himself, mortal and
 material man seems to be substance, but his sense of
 substance involves error and therefore is material,
 temporal.
 </p><p></p><p>On the other hand, the immortal, spiritual man is really
 substantial, and reflects the eternal substance, or Spirit,
 which mortals hope for. He reflects the divine, which
 constitutes the only real and eternal entity. This reflection
 seems to mortal sense transcendental, because the spiritual
 man's substantiality transcends mortal vision and is revealed only through divine Science.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Inverted images and ideas</font></p>
 As God is substance and man is the divine image and
 likeness, man should wish for, and in reality has, only
 the substance of good, the substance of Spirit,
 not matter. The belief that man has any other
 substance, or mind, is not spiritual and breaks
 the First Commandment, Thou shalt have one God, one
 Mind. Mortal man seems to himself to be material substance, while man is "image" (idea). Delusion, sin, disease, and death arise from the false testimony of material
 sense, which, from a supposed standpoint outside the
 focal distance of infinite Spirit, presents an inverted image
 of Mind and substance with everything turned upside
 down.
 <p></p><p>This falsity presupposes soul to be an unsubstantial
 dweller in material forms, and man to be material instead
 of spiritual. Immortality is not bounded by mortality.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_302"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 302</font></a></p><p></p><p>Soul is not compassed by finiteness. Principle is not to
 be found in fragmentary ideas.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Identity not lost</font></p>
 The material body and mind are temporal, but the
 real man is spiritual and eternal. The identity of the
 real man is not lost, but found through this
 explanation; for the conscious infinitude of
 existence and of all identity is thereby discerned and remains unchanged. It is impossible that man should lose
 aught that is real, when God is all and eternally his. The
 notion that mind is in matter, and that the so-called pleasures and pains, the birth, sin, sickness, and death of
 matter, are real, is a mortal belief; and this belief is all
 that will ever be lost.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Definition of man</font></p>
 Continuing our definition of man, let us remember that
 harmonious and immortal man has existed forever, and
 is always beyond and above the mortal illusion of any life, substance and intelligence
 as existent in matter. This statement is based on fact,
 not fable. The Science of being reveals man as perfect,
 even as the Father is perfect, because the Soul, or Mind,
 of the spiritual man is God, the divine Principle of all
 being, and because this real man is governed by Soul
 instead of sense, by the law of Spirit, not by the so-called
 laws of matter.
 <p></p><p>God is Love. He is therefore the divine, infinite Principle, called Person or God.  Man's true consciousness
 is in the mental, not in any bodily or personal likeness
 to Spirit. Indeed, the body presents no proper likeness
 of divinity, though mortal sense would fain have us so
 believe.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mental propagation</font></p>
 Even in Christian Science, reproduction by Spirit's
 individual ideas is but the reflection of the creative power
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_303"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 303</font></a></p><p></p><p>of the divine Principle of those ideas. The reflection,
 through mental manifestation, of the multitudinous
 forms of Mind which people the realm of 
 the real is controlled by Mind, the Principle 
 governing the reflection. Multiplication of God's children comes from no power of propagation in matter, it
 is the reflection of Spirit.
 </p><p></p><p>The minutiae of lesser individualities reflect the one divine individuality and are comprehended in and formed
 by Spirit, not by material sensation. Whatever reflects
 Mind, Life, Truth, and Love, is spiritually conceived and
 brought forth; but the statement that man is conceived
 and evolved both spiritually and materially, or by both
 God and man, contradicts this eternal truth. All the
 vanity of the ages can never make both these contraries
 true. Divine Science lays the axe at the root of the illusion that life, or mind, is formed by or is in the material
 body, and Science will eventually destroy this illusion
 through the self-destruction of all error and the beatified
 understanding of the Science of Life.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Error defined</font></p>
 The belief that pain and pleasure, life and death, holiness and unholiness, mingle in man,--that
 mortal, material man is the likeness of God
 and is himself a creator,--is a fatal error.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Man's entity spiritual</font></p>
 God, without the image and likeness of Himself, would
 be a nonentity, or Mind unexpressed. He would be
 without a witness or proof of His own nature. Spiritual man is the image or idea of
 God, an idea which cannot be lost nor separated from its divine Principle. When the evidence
 before the material senses yielded to spiritual sense, the
 apostle declared that nothing could alienate him from
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_304"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 304</font></a></p><p></p><p>God, from the sweet sense and presence of Life and
 Truth.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Man inseparable from Love</font></p>
 It is ignorance and false belief, based on a material
 sense of things, which hide spiritual beauty and goodness. Understanding this, Paul said: "Neither death, nor life, . . . nor things present,
 nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor
 any other creature, shall be able to separate us from
 the love of God." This is the doctrine of Christian
 Science: that divine Love cannot be deprived of its
 manifestation, or object; that joy cannot be turned into
 sorrow, for sorrow is not the master of joy; that good can
 never produce evil; that matter can never produce mind
 nor life result in death. The perfect man--governed
 by God, his perfect Principle--is sinless and eternal.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Harmony natural</font></p>
 Harmony is produced by its Principle, is controlled
 by it and abides with it. Divine Principle is the Life
 of man. Man's happiness is not, therefore, at
 the disposal of physical sense. Truth is not
 contaminated by error. Harmony in man is as beautiful
 as in music, and discord is unnatural, unreal.
 <p></p><p>The science of music governs tones. If mortals caught harmony through material sense, they would lose harmony, if time or accident robbed them of material sense.
 To be master of chords and discords, the science of
 music must be understood. Left to the decisions
 of material sense, music is liable to be misapprehended and lost in confusion. Controlled by belief,
 instead of understanding, music is, must be, imperfectly expressed. So man, not understanding the Science of being,--thrusting aside his divine Principle as
 incomprehensible,--is abandoned to conjectures, left in
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_305"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 305</font></a></p><p></p><p>the hands of ignorance, placed at the disposal of illusions,
 subjected to material sense which is discord. A discontented, discordant mortal is no more a man than discord
 is music.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Human reflection</font></p>
 A picture in the camera or a face reflected in the mirror
 is not the original, though resembling it. Man, in the
 likeness of his Maker, reflects the central light
 of being, the invisible God. As there is no corporeality in the mirrored form, which is but a reflection,
 so man, like all things real, reflects God, his divine Principle, not in a mortal body.
 <p></p><p>Gender also is a quality, not of God, but a characteristic of mortal mind. The verity that God's image is not
 a creator, though he reflects the creation of Mind, God,
 constitutes the underlying reality of reflection. "Then
 answered Jesus and said unto them: Verily, verily I say
 unto you, the Son can do nothing of himself, but what he
 seeth the Father do: for what things soever He doeth,
 these also doeth the Son likewise."
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Inverted images</font></p>
 The inverted images presented by the senses, the deflections of matter as opposed to the Science of spiritual reflection, are all unlike Spirit, God. In
 the illusion of life that is here to-day and
 gone to-morrow, man would be wholly mortal, were
 it not that Love, the divine Principle that obtains in
 divine Science, destroys all error and brings immortality to light. Because man is the reflection of his
 Maker, he is not subject to birth, growth, maturity, decay. These mortal dreams are of human origin, not
 divine.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Jewish traditions</font></p>
 The Sadducees reasoned falsely about the resurrection, but not so blindly as the Pharisees, who believed
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_306"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 306</font></a></p><p></p><p>error to be as immortal as Truth. The Pharisees thought
 that they could raise the spiritual from the material. They
 would first make life result in death, and then
 resort to death to reproduce spiritual life.
 Jesus taught them how death was to be overcome by
 spiritual Life, and demonstrated this beyond cavil.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Divinity not childless</font></p>
 Life demonstrates Life. The immortality of Soul makes
 man immortal. If God, who is Life, were parted for a
 moment from His reflection, man, during that
 moment there would be no divinity reflected.
 The Ego would be unexpressed, and the Father would be
 childless,--no Father.
 <p></p><p>If Life or Soul and its representative, man, unite for
 a period and then are separated as by a law of divorce to
 be brought together again at some uncertain future time
 and in a manner unknown,--and this is the general
 religious opinion of mankind,--we are left without a
 rational proof of immortality. But man cannot be separated for an instant from God, if man reflects God.
 Thus Science proves man's existence to be intact.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Thought-forms</font></p>
 The myriad forms of mortal thought, made manifest
 as matter, are not more distinct nor real to the material senses than are the Soul-created forms
 to spiritual sense, which cognizes Life as permanent. Undisturbed amid the jarring testimony of the
 material senses, Science, still enthroned, is unfolding
 to mortals the immutable, harmonious, divine Principle,
 - is unfolding Life and the universe, ever present and
 eternal.
 <p></p><p>God's man, spiritually created, is not material and
 mortal.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The serpent's whisper</font></p>
 The parent of all human discord was the Adam-dream,
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_307"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 307</font></a></p><p></p><p>the deep sleep, in which originated the delusion that life
 and intelligence proceeded from and passed into matter.
 This pantheistic error, or so-called serpent, insists still upon the opposite of Truth, saying,
 "Ye shall be as gods;" that is, I will make error as real
 and eternal as Truth.
 </p><p></p><p>Evil still affirms itself to be mind, and declares that
 there is more than one intelligence or God. It says:
 "There shall be lords and gods many. I declare that God
 makes evil minds and evil spirits, and that I aid Him.
 Truth shall change sides and be unlike Spirit. I will
 put spirit into what I call matter, and matter shall seem 
 to have life as much as God, Spirit, who is the only life."
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Bad results from error</font></p>
 This error has proved itself to be error. Its life is found
 to be not Life, but only a transient, false sense of an existence which ends in death. Error charges
 its lie to Truth and says: "The Lord knows
 it. He has made man immortal and material, out of matter instead of Spirit." Thus error partakes of its own
 nature and utters its own falsities. If we regard matter
 as intelligent, and Mind as both good and evil, every sin
 or supposed material pain and pleasure seems normal,
 a part of God's creation, and so weighs against our course
 Spiritward.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Higher statutes</font></p>
 Truth has no beginning. The divine Mind is the Soul
 of man, and gives man dominion over all things. Man
 was not created from a material basis, nor
 bidden to obey material laws which Spirit never
 made; his province is in spiritual statutes, in the higher
 law of Mind.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The great question</font></p>
 Above error's awful din, blackness, and chaos, the voice
 of Truth still calls: "Adam, where art thou? Conscious<p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_308"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 308</font></a></p><p></p><p>ness, where art thou? Art thou dwelling in the belief
 that mind is in matter, and that evil is mind, or art thou
 in the living faith that there is and can be but
 one God, and keeping His commandment?"
 Until the lesson is learned that God is the only Mind governing man, mortal belief will be afraid as it was in the
 beginning, and will hide from the demand, "Where art
 thou?" This awful demand, "Adam, where art thou?"
 is met by the admission from the head, heart, stomach,
 blood, nerves, etc.: "Lo, here I am, looking for happiness
 and life in the body, but finding only an illusion, a blending of false claims, false pleasure, pain, sin, sickness, and
 death."
 </p><p></p><p>The Soul-inspired patriarchs heard the voice of Truth,
 and talked with God as consciously as man talks with man.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Wrestling of Jacob</font></p>
 Jacob was alone, wrestling with error,--struggling
 with a mortal sense of life, substance, and intelligence
 as existent in matter with its false pleasures
 and pains,--when an angel, a message from
 Truth and Love, appeared to him and smote the sinew,
 or strength, of his error, till he saw its unreality; and
 Truth, being thereby understood, gave him spiritual
 strength in this Peniel of divine Science. Then said
 the spiritual evangel: "Let me go, for the day breaketh;"
 that is, the light of Truth and Love dawns upon thee.
 But the patriarch, perceiving his error and his need
 of help, did not loosen his hold upon this glorious light
 until his nature was transformed. When Jacob was
 asked, "What is thy name?" he straightway answered;
 and then his name was changed to Israel, for "as a prince"
 had he prevailed and had "power with God and with
 men." Then Jacob questioned his deliverer, "Tell me,
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_309"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 309</font></a></p><p></p><p>I pray thee, thy name;" but this appellation was withheld,
 for the messenger was not a corporeal being, but a nameless, incorporeal impartation of divine Love to man, which,
 to use the word of the Psalmist, restored his Soul,--gave
 him the spiritual sense of being and rebuked his material
 sense.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Israel the new name</font></p>
 The result of Jacob's struggle thus appeared. He had
 conquered material error with the understanding of Spirit
 and of spiritual power. This changed the man.
 He was no longer called Jacob, but Israel, a prince of God, or a soldier of God, who had fought
 a good fight. He was to become the father of those, who
 through earnest striving followed his demonstration of the
 power of Spirit over the material senses; and the children
 of earth who followed his example were to be called the
 children of Israel, until the Messiah should rename them.
 If these children should go astray, and forget that Life
 is God, good, and that good is not in elements which are
 not spiritual,--thus losing the divine power which heals
 the sick and sinning,--they were to be brought back
 through great tribulation, to be renamed in Christian
 Science and led to deny material sense, or mind in matter,
 even as the gospel teaches.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Life never structural</font></p>
 The Science of being shows it to be impossible for infinite Spirit or Soul to be in a finite body or for man to
 have an intelligence separate from his Maker. 
 It is a self-evident error to suppose that there 
 can be such a reality as organic animal or vegetable life,
 when such so-called life always ends in death. Life is
 never for a moment extinct. Therefore it is never structural nor organic, and is never absorbed nor limited by its
 own formations.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_310"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 310</font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Thought seen as substance</font></p>
 The artist is not in his painting. The picture is the
 artist's thought objectified. The human belief fancies
 that it delineates thought on matter, but what
 is matter? Did it exist prior to thought?
 Matter is made up of supposititious mortal mind-force;
 but all might is divine Mind. Thought will finally be
 understood and seen in all form, substance, and color, but
 without material accompaniments. The potter is not in
 the clay; else the clay would have power over the potter.
 God is His own infinite Mind, and expresses all.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The central intelligence</font></p>
 Day may decline and shadows fall, but darkness flees
 when the earth has again turned upon its axis. The sun
 is not affected by the revolution of the earth.
 So Science reveals Soul as God, untouched
 by sin and death,--as the central life and intelligence
 around which circle harmoniously all things in the systems of Mind.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Soul imperishable</font></p>
 Soul changeth not. We are commonly taught that there
 is a human soul which sins and is spiritually lost,--that
 soul may be lost, and yet be immortal. If
 Soul could sin, Spirit, Soul, would be flesh instead of Spirit. It is the belief of the flesh and of material sense which sins. If Soul sinned, Soul would die.
 Sin is the element of self-destruction, and spiritual death
 is oblivion. If there was sin in Soul, the annihilation of
 Spirit would be inevitable. The only Life is Spirit, and
 if Spirit should lose Life as God, good, then Spirit, which
 has no other existence, would be annihilated.
 <p></p><p>Mind is God, and God is not seen by material sense,
 because Mind is Spirit, which material sense cannot discern. There is neither growth, maturity, nor decay in
 Soul. These changes are the mutations of material sense,
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_311"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 311</font></a></p><p></p><p>the varying clouds of mortal belief, which hide the truth
 of being.
 </p><p></p><p>What we term mortal mind or carnal mind, dependent 
 on matter for manifestation, is not Mind. God is Mind:
 all that Mind, God, is, or hath made, is good, and He
 made all. Hence evil is not made and is not real.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Sin only of the flesh</font></p>
 Soul is immortal because it is Spirit, which has no element of self-destruction. is man lost spiritually? No,
 he can only lose a sense material. All sin is
 of the flesh. It cannot be spiritual. Sin exists
 here or hereafter only so long as the illusion of mind in
 matter remains. It is a sense of sin, and not a sinful soul,
 which is lost. Evil is destroyed by the sense of good.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Soul impeccable</font></p>
 Through false estimates of soul as dwelling in sense
 and of mind as dwelling in matter, belief strays into a
 sense of temporary loss or absence of soul, spiritual truth. This state of error is the mortal
 dream of life and substance as existent in matter, and is
 directly opposite to the immortal reality of being. So long
 as we believe that soul can sin or that immortal Soul is in
 mortal body, we can never understand the Science of being. When humanity does understand this Science, it
 will become the law of Life to man,--even the higher law
 of Soul, which prevails over material sense through harmony and immortality.
 <p></p><p>The objects cognized by the physical senses have not
 the reality of substance. They are only what mortal
 belief calls them. Matter, sin, and mortality lose all
 supposed consciousness or claim to life or existence, as
 mortals lay off a false sense of life, substance, and intelligence. but the spiritual, eternal man is not touched by
 these phases of mortality.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_312"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 312</font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Sense-dreams</font></p>
 How true it is that whatever is learned through material
 sense must be lost because such so-called knowledge is
 reversed by the spiritual facts of being in
 Science. That which material sense calls
 intangible, is found to be substance. What to material
 sense seems substance, becomes nothingness, as the sensedream vanishes and reality appears.
 <p></p><p>The senses regard a corpse, not as man, but simply as
 matter. People say, "Man is dead;" but this death is
 the departure of a mortal's mind, not of matter. The
 matter is still there. The belief of that mortal that he
 must die occasioned his departure; yet you say that
 matter has caused his death.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Vain ecstasies</font></p>
 People go into ecstasies over the sense of a corporeal
 Jehovah, though with scarcely a spark of love in their
 hearts; yet God is love, and without Love,
 God, immortality cannot appear. Mortals try
 to believe without understanding Truth; yet God is
 Truth. Mortals claim that death is inevitable; but man's
 eternal Principle is ever-present life. Mortals believe in
 a finite personal God; while God is infinite Love, which
 must be unlimited.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Man-made theories</font></p>
 Our theories are based on finite premises, which cannot penetrate beyond matter. A personal sense of God
 and of man's capabilities necessarily limits
 faith and hinders spiritual understanding. It
 divides faith and understanding between matter and Spirit,
 the finite and the infinite, and so turns away from the
 intelligent and divine healing Principle to the inanimate
 drug.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The one anointed</font></p>
 Jesus' spiritual origin and his demonstration of divine
 Principle richly endowed him and entitled him to sonship
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_313"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 313</font></a></p><p></p><p>in Science. He was the son of a virgin. The term
 Christ Jesus, or Jesus the Christ (to give the full and
 proper translation of the Greek), may be rendered "Jesus the anointed," Jesus the Godcrowned or the divinely royal man, as it is said of him in
 the first chapter of Hebrews: </p><p>   Therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee
    With the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
 </p><p></p><p>With this agrees another passage in the same chapter,
 which refers to the Son as "the brightness of His [God's]
 glory, and the express [expressed] image of His person
 [infinite Mind]." It is noteworthy that the phrase "express image" in the Common Version is, in the Greek
 Testament, character. Using this word in its higher meaning, we may assume that the author of this remarkable
 epistle regarded Christ as the Son of God, the royal
 reflection of the infinite; and the cause given for the exaltation of Jesus, Mary's son, was that he "loved righteousness and hated iniquity." The passage is made
 even clearer in the translation of the late George R.
 Noyes, D.D.: "Who, being a brightness from His glory,
 and an image of His being."
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Jesus the Scientist</font></p>
 Jesus of Nazareth was the most scientific man that
 ever trod the globe. He plunged beneath the material
 surface of things, and found the spiritual 
 cause. To accommodate himself to immature ideas of spiritual power,--for spirituality was pos
 sessed only in a limited degree even by his disciples, Jesus called the body, which by spiritual power he
 raised from the grave, "flesh and bones." To show
 that the substance of himself was Spirit and the body
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_314"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 314</font></a></p><p></p><p>no more perfect because of death and no less material
 until the ascension (his further spiritual exaltation),
 Jesus waited until the mortal or fleshly sense had relinquished the belief of substance-matter, and spiritual
 sense had quenched all earthly yearnings. Thus he found
 the eternal Ego, and proved that he and the Father were
 inseparable as God and His reflection or spiritual man.
 Our Master gained the solution of being, demonstrating
 the existence of but one Mind without a second or equal.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The bodily resurrection</font></p>
 The Jews, who sought to kill this man of God, showed
 plainly that their material views were the parents of their
 wicked deeds. When Jesus spoke of reproducing his body,--knowing, as he did, that
 Mind was the builder,--and said, "Destroy this temple,
 and in three days I will raise it up," they thought that he
 meant their material temple instead of his body. To such
 materialists, the real man seemed a spectre, unseen and
 unfamiliar, and the body, which they laid in a sepulchre,
 seemed to be substance. This materialism lost sight of
 the true Jesus; but the faithful Mary saw him, and he
 presented to her, more than ever before, the true idea of
 Life and substance.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Opposition of materialists</font></p>
 Because of mortals' material and sinful belief, the
 spiritual Jesus was imperceptible to them. The higher
 his demonstration of divine Science carried
 the problem of being, and the more distinctly he uttered the demands of its divine Principle,
 Truth and Love, the more odious he became to sinners
 and to those who, depending on doctrines and material
 laws to save them from sin and sickness, were submissive to death as being in supposed accord with the
 inevitable law of life. Jesus proved them wrong by
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_315"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 315</font></a></p><p></p><p>his resurrection, and said: "Whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die."
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Hebrew theology</font></p>
 That saying of our Master, "I and my Father are one,"
 separated him from the scholastic theology of the rabbis.
 His better understanding of God was a rebuke
 to them. He knew of but one Mind and laid
 no claim to any other. He knew that the Ego was Mind
 instead of body and that matter, sin, and evil were not
 Mind; and his understanding of this divine Science
 brought upon him the anathemas of the age.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The true sonship</font></p>
 The opposite and false views of the people hid from
 their sense Christ's sonship with God. They could not
 discern his spiritual existence. Their carnal
 minds were at enmity with it. Their thoughts 
 were filled with mortal error, instead of with God's spiritual idea as presented by Christ Jesus. The likeness of
 God we lose sight of through sin, which beclouds the spiritual sense of Truth; and we realize this likeness only
 when we subdue sin and prove man's heritage, the liberty
 of the sons of God.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Immaculate conception</font></p>
 Jesus' spiritual origin and understanding enabled him
 to demonstrate the facts of being,--to prove irrefutably
 how spiritual Truth destroys material error,
 heals sickness, and overcomes death. The
 divine conception of Jesus pointed to this truth and presented an illustration of creation. The history of Jesus
 shows him to have been more spiritual than all other
 earthly personalities.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Jesus as mediator</font></p>
 Wearing in part a human form (that is, as it seemed
 to mortal view), being conceived by a human mother,
 Jesus was the mediator between Spirit and the flesh,
 between Truth and error. Explaining and demonstrat<p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_316"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 316</font></a></p><p></p><p>ing the way of divine Science, he became the way of
 salvation to all who accepted his word. From him mortals may learn how to escape from evil. The
 real man being linked by Science to his Maker,
 mortals need only turn from sin and lose sight of mortal
 selfhood to find Christ, the real man and his relation to
 God, and to recognize the divine sonship. Christ, Truth,
 was demonstrated through Jesus to prove the power of
 Spirit over the flesh,--to show that Truth is made
 manifest by its effects upon the human mind and body,
 healing sickness and destroying sin.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Spiritual government</font></p>
 Jesus represented Christ, the true idea of God. Hence
 the warfare between this spiritual idea and perfunctory
 religion, between spiritual clear-sightedness
 and the blindness of popular belief, which led
 to the conclusion that the spiritual idea could be killed
 by crucifying the flesh. The Christ-idea, or the Christman, rose higher to human view because of the crucifixion,
 and thus proved that truth was the master of death.
 Christ presents the indestructible man, whom Spirit creates, constitutes, and governs. Christ illustrates that
 blending with God, his divine Principle, which gives man
 dominion over all the earth.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Deadness in sin</font></p>
 The spiritual idea of God, as presented by Jesus, was
 scourged in person, and its Principle was rejected. That
 man was accounted a criminal who could
 prove God's divine power by healing the
 sick, casting out evils, spiritualizing materialistic beliefs,
 and raising the dead,--those dead in trespasses and
 sins, satisfied with the flesh, resting on the basis of matter, blind to the possibilities of Spirit and its correlative truth.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_317"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 317</font></a></p><p></p><p>Jesus uttered things which had been "secret from the
 foundation of the world,"--since material knowledge
 usurped the throne of the creative divine Principle, insisted
 on the might of matter, the force of falsity, the insignificance of spirit, and proclaimed an anthropomorphic God.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The cup of Jesus</font></p>
 Whosoever lives most the life of Jesus in this age
 and declares best the power of Christian Science, will
 drink of his Master's cup. Resistance to 
 Truth will haunt his steps, and he will incur the hatred of sinners, till "wisdom is justified of
 her children." These blessed benedictions rest upon
 Jesus' followers: "If the world hate you, ye know that
 it hated me before it hated you;" "Lo, I am with you
 alway,"--that is, not only in all time, but in all ways
 and conditions.
 <p></p><p>The individuality of man is no less tangible because
 it is spiritual and because his life is not at the mercy of
 matter. The understanding of his spiritual individuality
 makes man more real, more formidable in truth, and enables him to conquer sin, disease, and death. Our Lord
 and Master presented himself to his disciples after his
 resurrection from the grave, as the self-same Jesus whom
 they had loved before the tragedy on Calvary.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Material skepticism</font></p>
 To the materialistic Thomas, looking for the ideal
 Saviour in matter instead of in Spirit and to the testimony of the material senses and the body,
 more than to Soul, for an earnest of immortality,--to him Jesus furnished the proof that he was
 unchanged by the crucifixion. To this dull and doubting disciple Jesus remained a fleshly reality, so long as
 the Master remained an inhabitant of the earth. Nothing but a display of matter could make existence real
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_318"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 318</font></a></p><p></p><p>to Thomas. For him to believe in matter was no task,
 but for him to conceive of the substantiality of Spirit to know that nothing can efface Mind and immortality, in
 which Spirit reigns--was more difficult.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">What the senses originate</font></p>
 Corporeal senses define diseases as realities; but the
 Scriptures declare that God made all, even while the corporeal senses are saying that matter causes
 disease and the divine Mind cannot or will
 not heal it. The material senses originate and
 support all that is material, untrue, selfish, or debased.
 They would put soul into soil, life into limbo, and doom
 all things to decay. We must silence this lie of material
 sense with the truth of spiritual sense. We must cause
 the error to cease that brought the belief of sin and death
 and would efface the pure sense of omnipotence.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Sickness as discord</font></p>
 Is the sick man sinful above all others? No! but
 so far as he is discordant, he is not the image of God.
 Weary of their material beliefs, from which
 comes so much suffering, invalids grow more
 spiritual, as the error - or belief that life is in matter yields to the reality of spiritual Life.
 <p></p><p>The Science of Mind denies the error of sensation in
 matter, and heals with Truth. Medical science treats
 disease as though disease were real, therefore right, and
 attempts to heal it with matter. If disease is right it is
 wrong to heal it. Material methods are temporary, and
 are not adapted to elevate mankind.
 </p><p></p><p>The governor is not subjected to the governed. In
 Science man is governed by God, divine Principle, as
 numbers are controlled and proved by His laws. Intelligence does not originate in numbers, but is manifested
 through them. The body does not include soul, but man</p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_319"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 319</font></a></p><p></p><p>ifests mortality, a false sense of soul. The delusion that
 there is life in matter has no kinship with the Life supernal.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Unscientific introspection</font></p>
 Science depicts disease as error, as matter versus
 Mind, and error reversed as subserving the facts of
 health. To calculate one's life-prospects
 from a material basis, would infringe upon
 spiritual law and misguide human hope. Having faith
 in the divine Principle of Health and spiritually understanding God, sustains man under all circumstances;
 whereas the lower appeal to the general faith in material
 means (commonly called nature) must yield to the allmight of infinite Spirit.
 <p></p><p>Throughout the infinite cycles of eternal existence,
 Spirit and matter neither concur in man nor in the universe.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">God the only Mind</font></p>
 The varied doctrines and theories which presuppose
 life and intelligence to exist in matter are so many ancient
 and modern mythologies. Mystery, miracle,
 sin, and death will disappear when it becomes
 fairly understood that the divine Mind controls man and
 man has no Mind but God.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Scriptures misinterpreted</font></p>
 The divine Science taught in the original language
 of the Bible came through inspiration, and needs inspiration to be understood. Hence the misapprehension of the spiritual meaning of the Bible,
 and the misinterpretation of the Word in
 some instances by uninspired writers, who only wrote
 down what an inspired teacher had said. A misplaced
 word changes the sense and misstates the Science of
 the Scriptures, as, for instance, to name Love as merely
 an attribute of God; but we can by special and proper
 capitalization speak of the love of Love, meaning by that
 what the beloved disciple meant in one of his epistles,
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_320"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 320</font></a></p><p></p><p>when he said, "God is love." Likewise we can speak of
 the truth of Truth and of the life of Life, for Christ plainly
 declared, "I am the way, the truth, and the life."
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Interior meaning</font></p>
 Metaphors abound in the Bible, and names are often
 expressive of spiritual ideas. The most distinguished
 theologians in Europe and America agree that
 the Scriptures have both a spiritual and literal meaning. In Smith's Bible Dictionary it is said:
 "The spiritual interpretation of Scripture must rest
 upon both the literal and moral;" and in the learned
 article on Noah in the same work, the familiar text,
 Genesis vi. 3, "And the Lord said, My spirit shall not
 always strive with man, for that he also is flesh," is quoted
 as follows, from the original Hebrew: "And Jehovah
 said, My spirit shall not forever rule [or be humbled] in
 men, seeing that they are [or, in their error they are]
 but flesh." Here the original text declares plainly the
 spiritual fact of being, even man's eternal and harmonious existence as image, idea, instead of matter (however transcendental such a thought appears), and avers
 that this fact is not forever to be humbled by the belief
 that man is flesh and matter, for according to that error
 man is mortal.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Job, on the resurrection</font></p>
 The one important interpretation of Scripture is the
 spiritual. For example, the text, "In my flesh shall I
 see God," gives a profound idea of the divine power to heal the ills of the flesh, and
 encourages mortals to hope in Him who healeth all our
 diseases; whereas this passage is continually quoted
 as if Job intended to declare that even if disease and
 worms destroyed his body, yet in the latter days he should
 stand in celestial perfection before Elohim, still clad
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_321"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 321</font></a></p><p></p><p>in material flesh, - an interpretation which is just the opposite of the true, as may be seen by studying the book
 of Job. As Paul says, in his first epistle to the Corinthians, "Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of
 God."
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Fear of the serpent overcome</font></p>
 The Hebrew Lawgiver, slow of speech, despaired of
 making the people understand what should be revealed
 to him. When, led by wisdom to cast down his
 rod, he saw it become a serpent, Moses fled before it; but wisdom bade him come back and
 handle the serpent, and then Moses' fear departed. In
 this incident was seen the actuality of Science. Matter
 was shown to be a belief only. The serpent, evil, under
 wisdom's bidding, was destroyed through understanding
 divine Science, and this proof was a staff upon which to
 lean. The illusion of Moses lost its power to alarm him,
 when he discovered that what he apparently saw was really
 but a phase of mortal belief.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Leprosy healed</font></p>
 It was scientifically demonstrated that leprosy was a
 creation of mortal mind and not a condition of matter,
 when Moses first put his hand into his bosom 
 and drew it forth white as snow with the dread
 disease, and presently restored his hand to its natural condition by the same simple process. God had lessened
 Moses' fear by this proof in divine Science, and the inward voice became to him the voice of God, which said:
 "It shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither
 hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe
 the voice of the latter sign." And so it was in the coming
 centuries, when the Science of being was demonstrated
 by Jesus, who showed his students the power of Mind by
 changing water into wine, and taught them how to handle
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_322"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 322</font></a></p><p></p><p>serpents unharmed, to heal the sick and cast out evils in
 proof of the supremacy of Mind.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Standpoints changed</font></p>
 When understanding changes the standpoints of life and
 intelligence from a material to a spiritual basis, we shall
 gain the reality of Life, the control of Soul over
 sense, and we shall perceive Christianity, or
 Truth, in its divine Principle. This must be the climax
 before harmonious and immortal man is obtained and his
 capabilities revealed. It is highly important--in view
 of the immense work to be accomplished before this recognition of divine Science can come--to turn our thoughts
 towards divine Principle, that finite belief may be prepared to relinquish its error.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Saving the inebriate</font></p>
 Man's wisdom finds no satisfaction in sin, since God
 has sentenced sin to suffer. The necromancy of yesterday foreshadowed the mesmerism and hypnotism of to-day. The drunkard thinks he enjoys
 drunkenness, and you cannot make the inebriate leave
 his besottedness, until his physical sense of pleasure yields
 to a higher sense. Then he turns from his cups, as
 the startled dreamer who wakens from an incubus incurred through the pains of distorted sense. A man who
 likes to do wrong--finding pleasure in it and refraining
 from it only through fear of consequences--is neither
 a temperate man nor a reliable religionist.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Uses of suffering</font></p>
 The sharp experiences of belief in the supposititious life
 of matter, as well as our disappointments and ceaseless
 woes, turn us like tired children to the arms
 of divine Love. Then we begin to learn Life
 in divine Science. Without this process of weaning,
 "Canst thou by searching find out God?" It is easier
 to desire Truth than to rid one's self of error. Mortals
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_323"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 323</font></a></p><p></p><p>may seek the understanding of Christian Science, but they
 will not be able to glean from Christian Science the facts
 of being without striving for them. This strife consists
 in the endeavor to forsake error of every kind and to possess no other consciousness but good.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">A bright outlook</font></p>
 Through the wholesome chastisements of Love, we
 are helped onward in the march towards righteousness,
 peace, and purity, which are the landmarks
 of Science. Beholding the infinite tasks of
 truth, we pause,--wait on God. Then we push onward,
 until boundless thought walks enraptured, and conception unconfined is winged to reach the divine glory.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Need and supply</font></p>
 In order to apprehend more, we must put into practice what we already know. We must recollect that
 Truth is demonstrable when understood, and
 that good is not understood until demonstrated.
 If "faithful over a few things," we shall be made rulers
 over many; but the one unused talent decays and is lost.
 When the sick or the sinning awake to realize their need
 of what they have not, they will be receptive of divine
 Science, which gravitates towards Soul and away from
 material sense, removes thought from the body, and elevates even mortal mind to the contemplation of something better than disease or sin. The true idea of God
 gives the true understanding of Life and Love, robs the
 grave of victory, takes away all sin and the delusion that
 there are other minds, and destroys mortality.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Childlike receptivity</font></p>
 The effects of Christian Science are not so much seen
 as felt. It is the "still, small voice" of Truth
 uttering itself. We are either turning away
 from this utterance, or we are listening to it and going
 up higher. Willingness to become as a little child and
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_324"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 324</font></a></p><p></p><p>to leave the old for the new, renders thought receptive of
 the advanced idea. Gladness to leave the false landmarks
 and joy to see them disappear,--this disposition helps
 to precipitate the ultimate harmony. The purification
 of sense and self is a proof of progress. "Blessed are the
 pure in heart: for they shall see God."
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Narrow pathway</font></p>
 Unless the harmony and immortality of man are becoming more apparent, we are not gaining the true idea
 of God; and the body will reflect what governs it, whether it be Truth or error,
 understanding or belief, Spirit or matter. Therefore
 "acquaint now thyself with Him, and be at peace."
 Be watchful, sober, and vigilant. The way is straight
 and narrow, which leads to the understanding that God
 is the only Life. It is a warfare with the flesh, in which
 we must conquer sin, sickness, and death, either here
 or hereafter,--certainly before we can reach the goal
 of Spirit, or life in God.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Paul's enlightenment</font></p>
 Paul was not at first a disciple of Jesus but a persecutor of Jesus' followers. When the truth first appeared
 to him in Science, Paul was made blind,
 and his blindness was felt; but spiritual
 light soon enabled him to follow the example and teachings of Jesus, healing the sick and preaching Christianity throughout Asia Minor, Greece, and even in imperial
 Rome.
 <p></p><p>Paul writes, "If Christ [Truth] be not risen, then is
 our preaching vain." That is, if the idea of the supremacy of Spirit, which is the true conception of being,
 come not to your thought, you cannot be benefited by
 what I say.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Abiding in Life</font></p>
 Jesus said substantially, "He that believeth in me
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_325"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 325</font></a></p><p></p><p>shall not see death." That is, he who perceives the
 true idea of Life loses his belief in death. He who has
 the true idea of good loses all sense of evil,
 and by reason of this is being ushered into the
 undying realities of Spirit. Such a one abideth in Life, life obtained not of the body incapable of supporting life,
 but of Truth, unfolding its own immortal idea. Jesus
 gave the true idea of being, which results in infinite blessings to mortals.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Indestructible being</font></p>
 In Colossians (iii. 4) Paul writes: "When Christ, who
 is our life, shall appear [be manifested], then shall ye also
 appear [be manifested] with him in glory."
 When spiritual being is understood in all its
 perfection, continuity, and might, then shall man be found
 in God's image. The absolute meaning of the apostolic
 words is this: Then shall man be found, in His likeness,
 perfect as the Father, indestructible in Life, "hid with
 Christ in God,"--with Truth in divine Love, where
 human sense hath not seen man.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Consecration required</font></p>
 Paul had a clear sense of the demands of Truth upon
 mortals physically and spiritually, when he said: "Present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable
 service." But he, who is begotten of the beliefs of the
 flesh and serves them, can never reach in this world the
 divine heights of our Lord. The time cometh when
 the spiritual origin of man, the divine Science which
 ushered Jesus into human presence, will be understood
 and demonstrated.
 <p></p><p>When first spoken in any age, Truth, like the light,
 "shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehended
 it not." A false sense of life, substance, and mind
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_326"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 326</font></a></p><p></p><p>hides the divine possibilities, and conceals scientific
 demonstration.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Loving God supremely</font></p>
 If we wish to follow Christ, Truth, it must be in the
 way of God's appointing. Jesus said, "He that believeth
 on me, the works that I do shall he do also."
 He, who would reach the source and find the
 divine remedy for every ill, must not try to climb the hill
 of Science by some other road. All nature teaches God's
 love to man, but man cannot love God supremely and set
 his whole affections on spiritual things, while loving the
 material or trusting in it more than in the spiritual.
 <p></p><p>We must forsake the foundation of material systems,
 however time-honored, if we would gain the Christ as
 our only Saviour. Not partially, but fully, the great
 healer of mortal mind is the healer of the body.
 </p><p></p><p>The purpose and motive to live aright can be gained
 now. This point won, you have started as you should.
 You have begun at the numeration-table of Christian
 Science, and nothing but wrong intention can hinder your
 advancement. Working and praying with true motives,
 your Father will open the way. "Who did hinder you,
 that ye should not obey the truth?"
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Conversion of Saul</font></p>
 Saul of Tarsus beheld the way--the Christ, or Truth
 - only when his uncertain sense of right yielded to a
 spiritual sense, which is always right. Then
 the man was changed. Thought assumed a
 nobler outlook, and his life became more spiritual. He
 learned the wrong that he had done in persecuting Christians, whose religion he had not understood, and in humility he took the new name of Paul. He beheld for the
 first time the true idea of Love, and learned a lesson in
 divine Science.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_327"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 327</font></a></p><p></p><p>Reform comes by understanding that there is no abiding pleasure in evil, and also by gaining an affection for
 good according to Science, which reveals the immortal
 fact that neither pleasure nor pain, appetite nor passion,
 can exist in or of matter, while divine Mind can and does
 destroy the false beliefs of pleasure, pain, or fear and all
 the sinful appetites of the human mind.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Image of the beast</font></p>
 What a pitiful sight is malice, finding pleasure in revenge! Evil is sometimes a man's highest conception
 of right, until his grasp on good grows stronger.
 Then he loses pleasure in wickedness, and it 
 becomes his torment. The way to escape the misery of
 sin is to cease sinning. There is no other way. Sin is
 the image of the beast to be effaced by the sweat of agony.
 It is a moral madness which rushes forth to clamor with
 midnight and tempest.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Peremptory demands</font></p>
 To the physical senses, the strict demands of Christian
 Science seem peremptory; but mortals are hastening to learn that Life is God, good, and that
 evil has in reality neither place nor power in the human or
 the divine economy.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Moral courage</font></p>
 Fear of punishment never made man truly honest.
 Moral courage is requisite to meet the wrong and to
 proclaim the right. But how shall we reform the man who has more animal than
 moral courage, and who has not the true idea of good?
 Through human consciousness, convince the mortal of
 his mistake in seeking material means for gaining happiness. Reason is the most active human faculty. Let
 that inform the sentiments and awaken the man's dormant sense of moral obligation, and by degrees he will
 learn the nothingness of the pleasures of human sense
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_328"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 328</font></a></p><p></p><p>and the grandeur and bliss of a spiritual sense, which
 silences the material or corporeal. Then he not only will
 be saved, but is saved.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Final destruction of error</font></p>
 Mortals suppose that they can live without goodness,
 when God is good and the only real Life. What is the
 result? Understanding little about the divine
 Principle which saves and heals, mortals get
 rid of sin, sickness, and death only in belief. These errors
 are not thus really destroyed, and must therefore cling
 to mortals until, here or hereafter, they gain the true understanding of God in the Science which destroys human
 delusions about Him and reveals the grand realities of
 His allness.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Promise perpetual</font></p>
 This understanding of man's power, when he is
 equipped by God, has sadly disappeared from Christian
 history. For centuries it has been dormant, a
 lost element of Christianity. Our missionaries
 carry the Bible to India, but can it be said that they
 explain it practically, as Jesus did, when hundreds of
 persons die there annually from serpent-bites? Understanding spiritual law and knowing that there is no material law, Jesus said: "These signs shall follow them that
 believe, . . . they shall take up serpents, and if they
 drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them. They
 shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover." It
 were well had Christendom believed and obeyed this
 sacred saying.
 <p></p><p>Jesus' promise is perpetual. Had it been given only
 to his immediate disciples, the Scriptural passage would
 read you, not they. The purpose of his great life-work
 extends through time and includes universal humanity.
 Its Principle is infinite, reaching beyond the pale of a
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_329"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 329</font></a></p><p></p><p>single period or of a limited following. As time moves
 on, the healing elements of pure Christianity will be fairly
 dealt with; they will be sought and taught, and will glow
 in all the grandeur of universal goodness.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Imitation of Jesus</font></p>
 A little leaven leavens the whole lump. A little understanding of Christian Science proves the truth of all that
 I say of it. Because you cannot walk on the
 water and raise the dead, you have no right to 
 question the great might of divine Science in these directions. Be thankful that Jesus, who was the true demonstrator of Science, did these things, and left his example for
 us. In Science we can use only what we understand. We
 must prove our faith by demonstration.
 <p></p><p>One should not tarry in the storm if the body is freezing, nor should he remain in the devouring flames. Until one is able to prevent bad results, he should avoid their
 occasion. To be discouraged, is to resemble a pupil in
 addition, who attempts to solve a problem of Euclid, and
 denies the rule of the problem because he fails in his first
 effort.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Error destroyed, not pardoned</font></p>
 There is no hypocrisy in Science. Principle is imperative. You cannot mock it by human will. Science is a
 divine demand, not a human. Always right,
 its divine Principle never repents, but maintains the claim of Truth by quenching error.
 The pardon of divine mercy is the destruction of error. If
 men understood their real spiritual source to be all blessedness, they would struggle for recourse to the spiritual
 and be at peace; but the deeper the error into which mortal mind is plunged, the more intense the opposition to
 spirituality, till error yields to Truth.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The hopeful outlook</font></p>
 Human resistance to divine Science weakens in pro<p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_330"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 330</font></a></p><p></p><p>portion as mortals give up error for Truth and the understanding of being supersedes mere belief. Until the
 author of this book learned the vastness of
 Christian Science, the fixedness of mortal illusions, and the human hatred of Truth, she cherished
 sanguine hopes that Christian Science would meet with
 immiediate and universal acceptance.
 </p><p></p><p>When the following platform is understood and the
 letter and the spirit bear witness, the infallibility of divine
 metaphysics will be demonstrated.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The deific supremacy</font></p>
 I. God is infinite, the only Life, substance, Spirit, or
 Soul, the only intelligence of the universe, including man.
 Eye hath neither seen God nor His image and
 likeness. Neither God nor the perfect man
 can be discerned by the material senses. The individuality of Spirit, or the infinite, is unknown, and thus a
 knowledge of it is left either to human conjecture or to the
 revelation of divine Science.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The deific definitions</font></p>
 II. God is what the Scriptures declare Him to be, Life, Truth, Love. Spirit is divine Principle, and divine
 Principle is Love, and Love is Mind, and
 Mind is not both good and bad, for God is
 Mind; therefore there is in reality one Mind only, because there is one God.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Evil obsolete</font></p>
 III. The notion that both evil and good are real is a
 delusion of material sense, which Science annihilates.
 Evil is nothing, no thing, mind, nor power.
 As manifested by mankind it stands for a lie,
 nothing claiming to be something,--for lust, dishonesty,
 selfishness, envy, hypocrisy, slander, hate, theft, adultery,
 murder, dementia, insanity, inanity, devil, hell, with all
 the etceteras that word includes.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_331"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 331</font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Life the creator</font></p>
 IV. God is divine Life, and Life is no more confined
 to the forms which reflect it than substance is in its
 shadow. If life were in mortal man or material things, it would be subject to their limitations and would end in death. Life is Mind, the creator
 reflected in His creations. If He dwelt within what He
 creates, God would not be reflected but absorbed, and the
 Science of being would be forever lost through a mortal
 sense, which falsely testifies to a beginning and an
 end.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Allness of Spirit</font></p>
 V. The Scriptures imply that God is All-in-all. From
 this it follows that nothing possesses reality nor existence
 except the divine Mind and His ideas.  The
 Scriptures also declare that God is Spirit.
 Therefore in Spirit all is harmony, and there can be no
 discord; all is Life, and there is no death. Everything
 in God's universe expresses Him.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The universal cause</font></p>
 VI. God is individual, incorporeal. He is divine Principle, Love, the universal cause, the only creator, and
 there is no other self-existence. He is allinclusive, and is reflected by all that is real
 and eternal and by nothing else. He fills all space, and
 it is impossible to conceive of such omnipresence and individuality except as infinite Spirit or Mind. Hence all 
 is Spirit and spiritual.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Divine trinity</font></p>
 VII. Life, Truth, and Love constitute the triune Person
 called God,--that is, the triply divine Principle, Love.
 They represent a trinity in unity, three in
 one, - the same in essence, though multiform in office: God the Father-Mother; Christ the spiritual idea of sonship; divine Science or the Holy Comforter.
 These three express in divine Science the threefold, essen<p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_332"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 332</font></a></p><p></p><p>tial nature of the infinite. They also indicate the divine
 Principle of scientific being, the intelligent relation of God
 to man and the universe.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Father-Mother</font></p>
 VIII. Father-Mother is the name for Deity, which indicates His tender relationship to His spiritual creation.
 As the apostle expressed it in words which he
 quoted with approbation from a classic poet:
 "For we are also His offspring."
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The Son of God</font></p>
 IX. Jesus was born of Mary. Christ is the true idea
 voicing good, the divine message from God to men speaking to the human consciousness. The Christ
 is incorporeal, spiritual,--yea, the divine
 image and likeness, dispelling the illusions of the senses;
 the Way, the Truth, and the Life, healing the sick and
 casting out evils, destroying sin, disease, and death. As
 Paul says: "There is one God, and one mediator between
 God and men, the man Christ Jesus." The corporeal
 man Jesus was human.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Holy Ghost or Comforter</font></p>
 X. Jesus demonstrated Christ; he proved that Christ
 is the divine idea of God--the Holy Ghost,
 or Comforter, revealing the divine Principle,
 Love, and leading into all truth.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Christ Jesus</font></p>
 XI. Jesus was the son of a virgin. He was appointed
 to speak God's word and to appear to mortals in such
 a form of humanity as they could understand
 as well as perceive. Mary's conception of
 him was spiritual, for only purity could reflect Truth
 and Love, which were plainly incarnate in the good and
 pure Christ Jesus. He expressed the highest type of
 divinity, which a fleshly form could express in that age.
 Into the real and ideal man the fleshly element cannot
 enter. Thus it is that Christ illustrates the coincidence,
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_333"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 333</font></a></p><p></p><p>or spiritual agreement, between God and man in His
 image.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Messiah or Christ</font></p>
 XII. The word Christ is not properly a synonym for 
 Jesus, though it is commonly so used. Jesus was a human
 name, which belonged to him in common with 
 other Hebrew boys and men, for it is identical 
 with the name Joshua, the renowned Hebrew leader. On
 the other hand, Christ is not a name so much as the divine
 title of Jesus. Christ expresses God's spiritual, eternal
 nature. The name is synonymous with Messiah, and alludes to the spirituality which is taught, illustrated, and
 demonstrated in the life of which Christ Jesus was the
 embodiment. The proper name of our Master in the
 Greek was Jesus the Christ; but Christ Jesus better signifies the Godlike.
 <p></p><p><font size="1">The divine Principle and idea </font></p>
 XIII. The advent of Jesus of Nazareth marked the
 first century of the Christian era, but the Christ is
 without beginning of years or end of days. 
 Throughout all generations both before and 
 after the Christian era, the Christ, as the spiritual idea,--the reflection of God,--has come with some 
 measure of power and grace to all prepared to receive
 Christ, Truth. Abraham, Jacob, Moses, and the prophets
 caught glorious glimpses of the Messiah, or Christ, which 
 baptized these seers in the divine nature, the essence of
 Love. The divine image, idea, or Christ was, is, and
 ever will be inseparable from the divine Principle, God. 
 Jesus referred to this unity of his spiritual identity thus:
 "Before Abraham was, I am;" "I and my Father are
 one;" "My Father is greater than I." The one Spirit 
 includes all identities.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Spiritual oneness</font></p>
 XIV. By these sayings Jesus meant, not that the hu<p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_334"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 334</font></a></p><p></p><p>man Jesus was or is eternal, but that the divine idea or
 Christ was and is so and therefore antedated Abraham;
 not that the corporeal Jesus was one with the
 Father, but that the spiritual idea, Christ,
 dwells forever in the bosom of the Father, God, from
 which it illumines heaven and earth; not that the Father
 is greater than Spirit, which is God, but greater, infinitely
 greater, than the fleshly Jesus, whose earthly career was
 brief.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The Son's duality</font></p>
 XV. The invisible Christ was imperceptible to the
 so-called personal senses, whereas Jesus appeared as a
 bodily existence. This dual personality of the
 unseen and the seen, the spiritual and material, the eternal Christ and the corporeal Jesus manifest
 in flesh, continued until the Master's ascension, when
 the human, material concept, or Jesus, disappeared,
 while the spiritual self, or Christ, continues to exist in
 the eternal order of divine Science, taking away the sins
 of the world, as the Christ has always done, even before
 the human Jesus was incarnate to mortal eyes.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Eternity of the Christ</font></p>
 XVI. This was "the Lamb slain from the foundation
 of the world," - slain, that is, according to the testimony of the corporeal senses, but undying in
 the deific Mind. The Revelator represents the
 Son of man as saying (Revelation i. 17, 18): "I am the
 first and the last: I am he that liveth, and was dead
 [not understood]; and, behold, I am alive for evermore,
 [Science has explained me]." This is a mystical statement of the eternity of  the Christ, and is also a reference
 to the human sense of  Jesus crucified.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Infinite Spirit</font></p>
 XVII. Spirit being God, there is but one Spirit, for
 there can be but one infinite and therefore one God.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_335"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 335</font></a></p><p></p><p>There are neither spirits many nor gods many. There 
 is no evil in Spirit, because God is Spirit. The theory,
 that Spirit is distinct from matter but must 
 pass through it, or into it, to be individualized, 
 would reduce God to dependency on matter, and establish
 a basis for pantheism.    
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The only substance </font></p>
 XVIII. Spirit, God, has created all in and of Himself. Spirit never created matter. There is nothing in
 Spirit out of which matter could be made,
 for, as the Bible declares, without the Logos, 
 the AEon or Word of God, "was not anything made
 that was made." Spirit is the only substance, the invisible and indivisible infinite God. Things spiritual and
 eternal are substantial. Things material and temporal
 are insubstantial.    
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Soul and Spirit one </font></p>
 XIX. Soul and Spirit being one, God and Soul are
 one, and this one never included in a limited mind or a
 limited body. Spirit is eternal, divine. Nothing but Spirit, Soul, can evolve Life, for Spirit 
 is more than all else. Because Soul is immortal, it does
 not exist in mortality. Soul must be incorporeal to be 
 Spirit, for Spirit is not finite. Only by losing the false
 sense of Soul can we gain the eternal unfolding of Life as
 immortality brought to light. 
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The one divine Mind   </font></p>
 XX. Mind is the divine Principle, Love, and can produce nothing unlike the eternal Father-Mother, God.
 Reality is spiritual, harmonious, immutable, 
 immortal, divine, eternal. Nothing unspiritual can be real, harmonious, or eternal. Sin, sickness,
 and mortality are the suppositional antipodes of Spirit, 
 and must be contradictions of reality.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The divine Ego</font></p>
 XXI. The Ego is deathless and limitless, for limits
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_336"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 336</font></a></p><p></p><p>would imply and impose ignorance. Mind is the I AM,
 or infinity. Mind never enters the finite. Intelligence
 never passes into non-intelligence, or matter.
 Good never enters into evil the unlimited into
 the limited, the eternal into the temporal, nor the immortal into mortality. The divine Ego, or individuality,
 is reflected in all spiritual individuality from the infinitesimal to the infinite.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The real manhood</font></p>
 XXII. Immortal man was and is God's image or idea,
 even the infinite expression of infinite Mind, and immortal man is coexistent and coeternal with that
 Mind. He has been forever in the eternal
 Mind, God; but infinite Mind can never be in man, but
 is reflected by man. The spiritual man's consciousness
 and individuality are reflections of God. They are the
 emanations of Him who is Life, Truth, and Love. Immortal man is not and never was material, but always
 spiritual and eternal.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Indivisibility of the infinite</font></p>
 XXIII. God is indivisible. A portion of God could
 not enter man; neither could God's fulness be reflected
 by a single man, else God would be manifestly
 finite, lose the deific character, and become
 less than God. Allness is the measure of the infinite, and
 nothing less can express God.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">God the parent Mind</font></p>
 XXIV. God, the divine Principle of man, and man in
 God's likeness are inseparable, harmonious, and eternal.
 The Science of being furnishes the rule of perfection, and brings immortality to light. God
 and man are not the same, but in the order of divine Science, God and man coexist and are eternal. God is the
 parent Mind, and man is God's spiritual offspring.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Man reflects the perfect God</font></p>
 XXV. God is individual and personal in a scientific
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_337"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 337</font></a></p><p></p><p>sense, but not in any anthropomorphic sense. Therefore
 man, reflecting God, cannot lose his individuality; but as
 material sensation, or a soul in the body, blind
 mortals do lose sight of spiritual individuality.
 Material personality is not realism; it is not
 the reflection or likeness of Spirit, the perfect God. Sensualism is not bliss, but bondage. For true happiness,
 man must harmonize with his Principle, divine Love; the
 Son must be in accord with the Father, in conformity with 
 Christ. According to divine Science, man is in a degree
 as perfect as the Mind that forms him. The truth of being makes man harmonious and immortal, while error is 
 mortal and discordant.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Purity the path to perfection</font></p>
 XXVI. Christian Science demonstrates that none but
 the pure in heart can see God, as the gospel 
 teaches. In proportion to his purity is man 
 perfect; and perfection is the order of celestial 
 being which demonstrates Life in Christ, Life's spiritual 
 ideal.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">True idea of man</font></p>
 XXVII. The true idea of man, as the reflection of the
 invisible God, is as incomprehensible to the limited senses 
 as is man's infinite Principle. The visible universe and material man are the poor counterfeits of the invisible universe and spiritual man. Eternal 
 things (verities) are God's thoughts as they exist in the
 spiritual realm of the real. Temporal things are the
 thoughts of mortals and are the unreal, being the opposite of the real or the spiritual and eternal.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Truth demonstrated</font></p>
 XXVIII. Subject sickness, sin, and death to the rule
 of health and holiness in Christian Science, 
 and you ascertain that this Science is demonstrably true, for it heals the sick and sinning as no
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_338"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 338</font></a></p><p></p><p>other system can. Christian Science, rightly understood, leads to eternal harmony. It brings to light the
 only living and true God and man as made in His likeness; whereas the opposite belief--that man originates
 in matter and has beginning and end, that he is both
 soul and body, both good and evil, both spiritual and
 material--terminates in discord and mortality, in the
 error which must be destroyed by Truth. The mortality
 of material man proves that error has been ingrafted
 into the premises and conclusions of material and mortal
 humanity.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Adam not ideal man</font></p>
 XXIX. The word Adam is from the Hebrew adamah,
 signifying the red color of the ground, dust, nothingness.
 Divide the name Adam into two syllables,
 and it reads, a dam, or obstruction. This
 suggests the thought of something fluid, of mortal mind
 in solution. It further suggests the thought of that
 "darkness . . . upon the face of the deep," when matter or dust was deemed the agent of Deity in creating
 man,--when matter, as that which is accursed, stood
 opposed to Spirit. Here a dam is not a mere play upon
 words; it stands for obstruction, error, even the supposed separation of man from God, and the obstacle
 which the serpent, sin, would impose between man and
 his creator. The dissection and definition of words,
 aside from their metaphysical derivation, is not scientific. Jehovah declared the ground was accursed; and
 from this ground, or matter, sprang Adam, notwithstanding God had blessed the earth "for man's sake."
 From this it follows that Adam was not the ideal man
 for whom the earth was blessed. The ideal man was
 revealed in due time, and was known as Christ Jesus.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_339"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 339</font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Divine pardon</font></p>
 XXX. The destruction of sin is the divine method of 
 pardon. Divine Life destroys death, Truth destroys
 error, and Love destroys hate. Being destroyed, sin needs no other form of forgiveness. 
 Does not God's pardon, destroying any one sin, prophesy
 and involve the final destruction of all sin? 
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Evil not produced by God </font></p>
 XXXI. Since God is All, there is no room for His
 unlikeness. God, Spirit, alone created all, and called it
 good. Therefore evil, being contrary to good, 
 is unreal, and cannot be the product of God. 
 A sinner can receive no encouragement from the fact that
 Science demonstrates the unreality of evil, for the sinner 
 would make a reality of sin,--would make that real
 which is unreal, and thus heap up "wrath against the
 day of wrath." He is joining in a conspiracy against 
 himself, - against his own awakening to the awful unreality by which he has been deceived. Only those, who
 repent of sin and forsake the unreal, can fully understand 
 the unreality of evil.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Basis of health and immortality</font></p>
 XXXII. As the mythology of pagan Rome has yielded
 to a more spiritual idea of Deity, so will our material 
 theories yield to spiritual ideas, until the finite 
 gives place to the infinite, sickness to health, 
 sin to holiness, and God's kingdom comes "in 
 earth, as it is in heaven." The basis of all health, sinlessness, and immortality is the great fact that God is
 the only Mind; and this Mind must be not merely believed, but it must be understood. To get rid of sin
 through Science, is to divest sin of any supposed mind
 or reality, and never to admit that sin can have intelligence or power, pain or pleasure. You conquer error by
 denying its verity. Our various theories will never lose
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_340"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 340</font></a></p><p></p><p>their imaginary power for good or evil, until we lose our
 faith in them and make life its own proof of harmony
 and God.
 </p><p></p><p>This text in the book of Ecclesiastes conveys the
 Christian Science thought, especially when the word
 duty, which is not in the original, is omitted: "Let
 us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God,
 and keep His commandments: for this is the whole
 duty of man." In other words: Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: love God and keep His
 commandments: for this is the whole of man in His
 image and likeness. Divine Love is infinite. Therefore
 all that really exists is in and of God, and manifests His
 love.
 </p><p></p><p>"Thou shalt have no other gods before me." (Exodus
 xx. 3.) The First Commandment is my favorite text.
 It demonstrates Christian Science. It inculcates the triunity of God, Spirit, Mind; it signifies that man shall
 have no other spirit or mind but God, eternal good, and
 that all men shall have one Mind. The divine Principle
 of the First Commandment bases the Science of being, by
 which man demonstrates health, holiness, and life eternal.
 One infinite God, good, unifies men and nations; constitutes the brotherhood of man; ends wars; fulfils the
 Scripture, "Love thy neighbor as thyself;" annihilates
 pagan and Christian idolatry,--whatever is wrong in
 social, civil, criminal, political, and religious codes;
 equalizes the sexes; annuls the curse on man, and leaves
 nothing that can sin, suffer, be punished or destroyed.
