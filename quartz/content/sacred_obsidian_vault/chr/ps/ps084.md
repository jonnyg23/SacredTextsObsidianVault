 <p>And the First Mystery continued again and said unto the disciples: "It came to pass then, when Pistis Sophia had finished uttering the words of this song, that she turned herself back</p>  
 <p><a name="page_146"><font size="1" color="green">p. 146</font></a></p>  
 <p>to see whether Adamas and his rulers had turned back to go to their æon. And she saw them, how they pursued after her. Then she turned unto them and said unto them:</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Sophia addresseth Adamas and his rulers.</font></span>"'1. Why pursue ye after me and say: I should not have help, that it [<i>sc.</i> the Light] should save me from you?</p>  
 <p>"'2. Now, therefore, my vindicator is the Light and a strong [one]; but it is long-suffering until the time of which it hath said unto me: I will come and help thee. And it will not bring its wrath upon you always. But this is the time of which he hath spoken unto me.</p>  
 <p>"'3. Now, therefore, if ye turn not back and cease not to pursue after me, then will the Light make ready its power, and it will make itself ready in all its powers.</p>  
 <p>"'4. And in its power hath it made itself ready, so that it may take your lights which are in you, and ye may become dark; and its power hath brought it to pass, so that it may take your power from you and ye go to ground.'</p>  
 <p>"And when Pistis Sophia had said this, she looked at the region of Adamas and saw the dark and chaotic region |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>174</b>.</font></span> which he had made, and saw also the two dark exceedingly violent emanations which Adamas had emanated, in order that they might seize Pistis Sophia and cast her down into the chaos which he had made, and constrain and harass her in that region, until they should take her light from her. It came to pass then, when Pistis Sophia had seen those two dark emanations and the dark region which Adamas had made, that she feared and cried unto the Light, saying:</p>  
 <p><a name="page_147"><font size="1" color="green">p. 147</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Sophia again singeth to the Light.</font></span>"'1. O Light, lo! Adamas, the doer of violence, is wrathful; he hath made a dark emanation,</p>  
 <p>"'2. And he hath also emanated another chaos and hath made another dark and chaotic [one] and made it ready.</p>  
 <p>"'3. Now, therefore, O Light, the chaos which he hath made, in order to cast me down therein and take from me my light-power, take then from him his own.</p>  
 <p>"'4. And the plan which he hath devised, to take my light,--they are to take his own from him; and the injustice which he hath spoken, to take my lights from me,--take then all of his.'</p>  
 <p>"These are the words which Pistis Sophia hath uttered in her song. Now, therefore, who is sober in spirit, let him come forward and set forth the solution of the words which Pistis Sophia [hath uttered] in her song."</p>
