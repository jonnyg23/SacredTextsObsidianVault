 <p>And Andrew came forward and said: "My Lord and Saviour, thy light-power hath prophesied aforetime through David concerning this repentance which Pistis Sophia hath uttered, and said in the one-hundred-and-eighth Psalm:</p>  
 <p>"'1. God, keep not silent at my praise-singing.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_90"><font size="1" color="green">p. 90</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Andrew interpreteth the twelfth repentance from Psalm cviii.</font></span>"'2. For the mouths of the sinner and crafty have opened their chops against me and with crafty deceitful tongue have talked behind me.</p>  
 <p>"'3. And they have surrounded me with words of hate and have fought against me without a cause.</p>  
 <p>"'4. Instead of loving me they have slandered me. But I prayed.</p>  
 <p>"'5. They showed evil against me for good and hate for my love.</p>  
 <p>"'6. Set a sinner over him, and let the slanderer stand at his right hand.</p>  
 <p>"'7. When sentence is passed upon him, may he go forth condemned and his prayer become sin.</p>  
 <p>"'8. May his days be shortened and another receive his overseership.</p>  
 <p>"'9. May his children become orphans and his wife a widow.</p>  
 <p>"'10. May his children be carried away and be driven forth and beg; may they be thrown out of their houses.</p>  
 <p>"'11. May the money-lender sift out all that he hath, |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>109</b>.</font></span> and may strangers plunder all his best efforts.</p>  
 <p>"'12. Let there be no man to back him, and no one to take pity on his orphans.</p>  
 <p>"'13. May his children be exterminated and his name blotted out in a single generation.</p>  
 <p>"'14. Let the sin of his fathers be remembered before the Lord, and the sin of his mother be not blotted out.</p>  
 <p>"'15. Let them be ever present to the Lord and his memory be rooted out from the earth;</p>  
 <p>"'16. In that he hath not thought of using</p>  
 <p><a name="page_91"><font size="1" color="green">p. 91</font></a></p>  
 <p>mercy and hath persecuted a poor and wretched man and hath persecuted a sorry creature to slay him.</p>  
 <p>"'17. He loved cursing,--and it shall come unto him. He desired not blessing,--it shall stay far from him.</p>  
 <p>"'18. He clothed himself with cursing as with a vesture, and it entered into his bowels as water, and it was as oil in his bones.</p>  
 <p>"'19. May it be for him as a garment in which he shall be wrapped, and as a girdle with which he shall ever be girded.</p>  
 <p>"'20. This is the work of them who slander [me] before the Lord, and speak unlawfully against my soul.</p>  
 <p>"'21. But do thou, O Lord God, be gracious unto me; for thy name's sake save me.</p>  
 <p>"'22. For I am poor and I am wretched; my heart is tumult within me. |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>110</b>.</font></span></p>  
 <p>"'23. I am carried away in the midst as a shadow which hath sunk down, and I am shaken out as grass-hoppers.</p>  
 <p>"'24. My knees have become weak from fasting, and my flesh is altered from [lack of] oil.</p>  
 <p>"'25. But I have become a mock unto them; they saw me and wagged their heads.</p>  
 <p>"'26. Help, O Lord God, and save me according to thy grace.</p>  
 <p>"'27. May they know that this is thy hand, and that thou, O Lord, hast fashioned them.'</p>  
 <p>"This is then the solution of the twelfth repentance which Pistis Sophia uttered, when she was in the chaos."</p>
