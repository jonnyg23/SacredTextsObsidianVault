 <p><span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>1</b>.</font></span><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Jesus hitherto instructeth his disciples only up to the regions of the First Mystery.</font></span>IT came to pass, when Jesus had risen from the dead, that he passed eleven years discoursing with his disciples, and instructing them only up to the regions of the First Commandment and up to the regions of the First Mystery, that within the Veil, within the First Commandment, which is the four-and-twentieth mystery without and below--those [four-and-twenty] which are in the second space of the First Mystery which is before all mysteries,--the Father in the form of a dove.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">What the First Mystery surroundeth.</font></span>And Jesus said to his disciples: "I am come forth out of that First Mystery, which is the last mystery, that is the four-and-twentieth mystery." And his disciples have not known nor understood that anything existeth within that mystery; but they thought of that mystery, that it is the head of the universe and the head of all existence; and they thought it is the completion of all completions, because Jesus had said to them concerning that mystery, that it surroundeth the First Commandment and the five Impressions and the great Light |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>2</b>.</font></span> and the five Helpers and the whole Treasury of the Light.</p>  
 <p>And moreover Jesus had not told his disciples</p>  
 <p><a name="page_2"><font size="1" color="green">p. 2</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">The regions of the great Invisible.</font></span>the total expansion of all the regions of the great Invisible and of the three triple-powers and of the four-and-twenty invisibles, and all their regions and their æons and their orders, how they are extended--those which are the emanations of the great Invisible--and their ungenerated and their self-generated and their generated and their light-givers and their unpaired and their rulers and their authorities and their lords and their archangels and their angels and their decans and their servitors and all the houses of their spheres and all the orders of every one of them.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">The Treasury of the Light.</font></span>And Jesus had not told his disciples the total expansion of the emanations of the Treasury, nor their orders, how they are extended; nor had he told them their saviours, according to the order of every one, how they are; nor had he told them what guard is at every [gate] of the Treasury of the Light; nor had he told them the region of the Twin-saviour, |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>3</b>.</font></span> who is the Child of the Child; nor had he told them the regions of the three Amēns, in what regions they are expanded; nor had he told them into what region the five Trees are expanded; nor as to the seven Amēns, that is the seven Voices, what is their region, how they are expanded.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">The Light-world.</font></span>And Jesus had not told his disciples of what type are the five Helpers, nor into what region they are brought; nor had he told them how the great Light hath expanded itself, nor into what region it hath been brought; nor had he told them of the five Impressions, nor as to the First Commandment, into what region they have been brought. But he had discoursed with them generally, teaching that they exist, but he had not told</p>  
 <p><a name="page_3"><font size="1" color="green">p. 3</font></a></p>  
 <p>them their expansion and the order of their regions, how they are. For this cause they have not known that there were also other regions within that mystery.</p>  
 <p>And he had not told his disciples: "I have gone forth out of such and such regions until I entered into that mystery, and until I went forth out of it"; but, in teaching them, he said to them: "I am come forth from that mystery." For this cause then they thought of that mystery, that it is the completion |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>4</b>.</font></span> of completions, and that it is the head of the universe and that it is the total Fulness. For Jesus had said to his disciples: "That mystery surroundeth that universe of which I have spoken unto you from the day when I met with you even unto this day." For this cause then the disciples thought there is nothing within that mystery.</p>
