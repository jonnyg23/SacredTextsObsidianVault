 <p>And Jesus continued again in the discourse and said unto his disciples: "It came to pass</p>  
 <p><a name="page_92"><font size="1" color="green">p. 92</font></a></p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p>again thereafter that Pistis Sophia cried unto me, saying:</p>  
 <p>"O Light of lights, I have transgressed in the twelve æons, and have descended from them; wherefor have I uttered the twelve repentances, [one] for each æon. Now, therefore, O Light of lights, forgive me my transgression, for it is exceedingly great, because I have abandoned the regions of the height and have come to dwell in the regions of the chaos.'</p>  
 <p>"When then Pistis Sophia had said this, she continued again in the thirteenth repentance, saying:</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">The thirteenth repentance of Sophia.</font></span>"'1. Hearken unto me singing praises unto thee, O Light of lights. Hearken unto me uttering the repentance for the thirteenth æon, the region out of which I have come down, in order that the thirteenth repentance of the thirteenth æon may be accomplished,--those [æons] |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>111</b>.</font></span> which I have overstepped and out of which I have come down.</p>  
 <p>"'2. Now, therefore, O Light of lights, hearken unto me singing praises unto thee in the thirteenth æon, my region out of which I have come down.</p>  
 <p>"'3. Save me, O Light, in thy great mystery and forgive my transgression in thy forgiveness.</p>  
 <p>"'4. And give unto me the baptism and forgive my sins and purify me from my transgression.</p>  
 <p>"'5. And my transgression is the lion-faced power, which will never be hidden from thee; for because of it have I gone down.</p>  
 <p>"'6. And I alone among the invisibles, in whose regions I was, have transgressed, and have gone down into the chaos. Moreover I have</p>  
 <p><a name="page_93"><font size="1" color="green">p. 93</font></a></p>  
 <p>transgressed, that thy commandment may be accomplished.'</p>  
 <p>"This then Pistis Sophia said. Now, therefore, let him whom his spirit urgeth to understand her words, come forward and proclaim her thought."</p>  
 <p>Martha came forward and said: "My Lord, my spirit urgeth me to proclaim the solution of that which Pistis Sophia hath spoken; thy power hath prophesied aforetime concerning it through David in the fiftieth Psalm, saying thus:</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Martha interpreteth the thirteenth repentance from Psalm l.</font></span>"'1. Be gracious unto me, O God, according to thy |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>112</b>.</font></span> great grace; according to the fulness of thy mercy blot out my sin.</p>  
 <p>"'2. Wash me <a href="errata.htm#1">thoroughly</a> from my iniquity.</p>  
 <p>"'3. And may my sin be ever present to thee,</p>  
 <p>"'4. That thou mayest be justified in thy words and prevail when thou judgest me.'</p>  
 <p>"This is then the solution of the words which Pistis Sophia hath uttered."</p>  
 <p>Jesus said unto her: "Well said, finely, Martha, blessed [one]."</p>
