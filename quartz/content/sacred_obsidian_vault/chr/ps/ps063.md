 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">The power sent by Jesus formeth a light-wreath on Sophia's head.</font></span>And Jesus continued again in the discourse and said unto his disciples: "It came to pass then, when Pistis Sophia had finished saying these words in the chaos, that I made the light-power, which I had sent to save her, become a light-wreath on her head, so that from now on the emanations of Self-willed could not have dominion over her. And when it had become a light-wreath round her head, all the evil matters in her were shaken and all were purified in her. They perished and remained in the chaos, while the emanations of Self-willed gazed upon them and rejoiced. And the purification of the pure light which was in Pistis Sophia, gave power to the light of my light-power, which had become a wreath round her head.</p>  
 <p>"It came to pass then moreover, when it surrounded the pure light in Sophia, and her pure light did not depart from the wreath of the power of the light-flame, so that the emanations of Self-willed should not rob it from it,--when then this befell her, the pure light-power in Sophia began to sing praises. And she praised my light-power, which was a wreath round her head, and she sang praises, saying:</p>  
 <p>"'1. The Light hath become a wreath round</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Sophia uttereth another song of praise.</font></span>my head; and I shall not depart from it, so that the emanations of Self-willed may not rob it from me.</p>  
 <p>"'2. And though all the matters be shaken, |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>116</b>.</font></span> yet shall I not be shaken.</p>  
 <p>"'3. And though all my matters perish and remain in the chaos,--those which the emanations of Self-willed see,--yet shall I not perish.</p>  
 <p>"'4. For the Light is with me, and I myself am with the Light.'</p>  
 <p>"These words then Pistis Sophia uttered. Now, therefore, let him who understandeth the thought of these words, come forward and proclaim their solution."</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Mary, his mother, asketh and receiveth permission to speak.</font></span>Then Mary, the mother of Jesus, came forward and said: "My son according to the world, my God and Saviour according to the height, bid me proclaim the solution of the words which Pistis Sophia hath uttered."</p>  
 <p>And Jesus answered and said: "Thou also, Mary, hast received form which is in Barbēlō, according to matter, and hast received likeness which is in the Virgin of Light, according to light, thou and the other Mary, the blessed one; and on thy account the darkness hath arisen, and moreover out of thee did come forth the material body in which I am, which I have purified and refined,--now, therefore, I bid thee proclaim the solution of the words which Pistis Sophia hath uttered."</p>  
 <p>And Mary, the mother of Jesus, answered and said: "My Lord, thy light-power hath prophesied aforetime concerning these words through Solomon in the nineteenth Ode and said:</p>  
 <p>"'1. The Lord is on my head as a wreath, and I shall not depart from him.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_98"><font size="1" color="green">p. 98</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Mary, his mother, interpreteth the song of Sophia from the xixth ode of Solomon.</font></span>"'2. The wreath in truth |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>117</b>.</font></span> is woven for me; and it hath caused thy twigs to sprout in me.</p>  
 <p>"'3. For it is not like unto a wreath withered that sprouteth not. But thou art alive on my head and thou hast sprouted upon me.</p>  
 <p>"'4. Thy fruits are full and perfect, filled with thy salvation.'"</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Jesus commendeth his mother.</font></span>It came to pass then, when Jesus had heard his. mother Mary say these words, that he said unto her: "Well said, finely. Amēn, amēn, I say unto thee: They shall proclaim thee blessed from one end of the earth to the other; for the pledge of the First Mystery hath taken up its abode with thee, and through that pledge shall all from the earth and all from the height be saved, and that pledge is the beginning and the end."</p>
