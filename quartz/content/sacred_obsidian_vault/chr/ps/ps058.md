 <p>Jesus continued again in the discourse and said unto his disciples: "It came to pass then, when this lion-faced power saw me, how I drew nigh unto Pistis Sophia, shining very exceedingly, that it grew still more furious and emanated from itself a multitude of exceedingly violent emanations. When this then befell, Pistis Sophia uttered the eleventh repentance, saying:</p>  
 <p>"'1. Why hath the mighty power raised itself in evil?</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">The eleventh repentance of Sophia.</font></span>"'2. Its plotting taketh away the light from me all the time, and as sharp iron have they taken away power |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>102</b>.</font></span> from me.</p>  
 <p>"'3. I chose to descend into the chaos rather than to abide in the thirteenth æon, the region of Righteousness.</p>  
 <p>"'4. And they desired to lead me craftily, in order to consume my whole light.</p>  
 <p>"'5. For this cause then will the Light take</p>  
 <p><a name="page_85"><font size="1" color="green">p. 85</font></a></p>  
 <p>away their whole light, and also their whole matter will be made naught. And it will take away their light and not suffer them to abide in the thirteenth æon, their dwelling-place, and will not have their name in the region of those who shall live.</p>  
 <p>"'6. And the four-and-twenty emanations will see what hath befallen thee, O lion-faced power, and will be afraid and not be disobedient, but give the purification of their light.</p>  
 <p>"'7. And they will see thee and will rejoice over thee and say: Lo, an emanation which hath not given the purification of its light, so that it may be saved, but boasted itself in the abundance of the light of its power, because it did not emanate from the power in it, and hath said: I will take away the light from Pistis Sophia, which will now be taken from it.'</p>  
 <p>"Now, therefore, let him in whom his power is raised, come forward and proclaim the solution of the eleventh repentance of Pistis Sophia."</p>  
 <p>Then Salome came forward and said: "My Lord, concerning this thy light-power prophesied aforetime through David in the fifty-first Psalm, saying:</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Salome interpreteth the repentance from Psalm li.</font></span>"'1. Why doth the mighty [one] boast himself in |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>103</b>.</font></span> his wickedness?</p>  
 <p>"'2. Thy tongue hath studied unrighteousness all the day long; as a sharp razor hast thou practised craft.</p>  
 <p>"'3. Thou lovedst wickedness more than goodness; thou lovedst to speak unrighteousness more than righteousness.</p>  
 <p>"'4. Thou lovedst all words of submerging and a crafty tongue.</p>  
 <p>"'5. Wherefor will God bring thee to naught</p>  
 <p><a name="page_86"><font size="1" color="green">p. 86</font></a></p>  
 <p>utterly, and will uproot thee and drag thee out from thy dwelling-place, and will root out thy root and cast it away from the living. (Selah.)</p>  
 <p>"'6. The righteous will see and be afraid, and they will mock at him and say:</p>  
 <p>"'7. Lo, a man who made not God for his helper, but trusted to his great riches and was mighty in his vanity.</p>  
 <p>"'8. But I am as a fruit-bearing olive-tree in the house of God. I have trusted in the grace of God from all eternity.</p>  
 <p>"'9. And I will confess unto thee, for thou hast dealt faithfully with me; and I will wait on thy name, for it is auspicious in the presence of thy holy [ones].'</p>  
 <p>"This then is now, therefore, my Lord, the solution of the eleventh repentance of Pistis Sophia. While thy light-power hath roused me, I have spoken it according to thy desire."</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Jesus commendeth Salome.</font></span>It came to pass then, when Jesus had heard these words which Salome spake, that he said: "Well said, Salome. Amēn, amēn, I say unto you: I will perfect you in all mysteries of the kingdom of the Light."</p>
