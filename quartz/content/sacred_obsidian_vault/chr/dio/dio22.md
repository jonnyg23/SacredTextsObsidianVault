 <p><a name="ii.iii.ii.iv-p3"></a>WE say then- that the Cause of all, which is above all, is neither without being,  nor without life--nor with- out reason, nor without mind, nor is a body--nor has shape--nor  form--nor quality, or quantity, or bulk--nor is in a place--nor is seen--nor has sensible  contact--nor perceives, nor is perceived, by the senses--nor has disorder and confusion,  as being vexed by earthly passions,--nor is powerless, as being subject to casualties  of sense,--nor is in need of light;--neither is It, nor has It, change, or  decay, or division, or deprivation, or flux,--or any other of the objects of sense.</p>
