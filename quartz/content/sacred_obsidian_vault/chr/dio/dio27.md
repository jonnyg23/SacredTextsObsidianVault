 <p><a name="ii.iv.ii.iii-p2"></a>"Sudden" is that which, contrary to expectation, and out of the, as yet, unmanifest,  is brought into the manifest. But with regard to Christ’s love of man, I think that  the Word of God suggests even this, that the Superessential proceeded forth out  of the hidden, into the manifestation amongst us, by having taken substance as man.  But, He is hidden, even after the manifestation, or to speak more divinely, even  in the manifestation, for in truth this of Jesus has been kept hidden, and the mystery  with respect to Him has been reached by no word nor mind, but even when spoken,  remains unsaid, and when conceived unknown. <a name="page_143"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 143</font></a> <a name="ii.iv.ii.iii-Page_143"></a></p>
