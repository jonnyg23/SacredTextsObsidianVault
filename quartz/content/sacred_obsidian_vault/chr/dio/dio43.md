 <p><a name="iv.i.iv-p1"></a>ALEXANDRIA became the home of Christian Philosophy, but Athens  was its birthplace. Pantaenus and Ammonius-Saccus were chief founders of the Alexandrine  School. They were both Christian. They both drew their teaching from the Word of  God, " the Fountain of Wisdom," and from the writings of Hierotheus, and Dionysius  the Areopagite--Bishops of Athens. For several centuries there had been a Greek  preparation for the Alexandrine School. As the Old Testament was a Schoolmaster,  leading to Christ, so the Septuagint, Pythagoras, Plato, Aristobulus, Philo, and  Apollos were heralds who prepared the minds of men for that fulness of light and  truth in Jesus Christ, which, in Alexandria, clothed itself in the bright  robes of Divine Philosophy.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.i.iv-p2"></a>Pantaenus was born in Athens, a.d. 120, and died in Alexandria,  a.d. 213. He was Greek by nationality, and Presbyter of the Church in, Alexandria  by vocation. First, Stoic, then Pythagorean, he became Christian some time before  a.d. 186, at which date he was appointed chief instructor in the Didaskeleion,  <a name="page_vi"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. vi</font></a> <a name="iv.i.iv-Page_vi"></a>by Demetrius, Bishop of Alexandria.  Pantaenus recognised the preparation for the Christian Faith in the Greek Philosophy.  Anastasius-Sinaita describes him as "one of the early expositors who agreed with  each other in treating the first six days of Creation as prophetic of Christ and  the whole Church."</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.i.iv-p3"></a>Eusebius says, that "Pantaenus expounded the treasures of the  Divine dogmas preserved direct, as from father to son, from St. Paul and other Apostles.  Phptius records that Pantaenus was pupil of those who had seen the Apostles, but  that he certainly had not listened to any of them themselves. Now, if Pantaenus  was pupil of those who had seen the Apostles, and yet had, not listened to their  oral teaching, it is natural to infer that he was pupil through their writings.  I am a pupil of Dr. Pusey, but I never listened to his oral teaching; I am pupil  through his writings. Now, there exist, to this day, the writings of two Presbyters  who had seen the Apostles--both, converts to the faith through St. Paul,---whose  writings contain the treasures of the Divine dogmas, received from St. Paul and  the other Apostles. Those two Presbyters are Hierotheus and Dionysius the Areopagite,  both ordained Bishop of Athens by St. Paul. Dionysius the Areopagite expressly calls,  St. Paul his "chief initiator," and as such, gives his teaching on the holy Angels,  in the sixth chapter of the Heavenly Hierarchy; and frequently describes St. Paul  as his "chief instructor."</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.i.iv-p4"></a>If, then, we can prove that the writings of  <a name="page_vii"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. vii</font></a> <a name="iv.i.iv-Page_vii"></a>Dionysius existed before and were known in Alexandria,  when Pantaenus delivered his lectures in that city, we may fairly infer that Pantaenus  would know, and knowing, would use, the writings penned by the Chief of his own  Areopagus, and Bishop of his own Athens.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.i.iv-p5"></a>Historical criticism does not permit us to reject probabilities,  merely because they confirm the Christian Faith.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.i.iv-p6"></a>Dexter, in his Chronicle, collected from the Archives of Toledo  and other churches in Spain, gives this testimony:--</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.i.iv-p7"></a>"U.C. 851 (a.d. 98). <a name="iv.i.iv-p7.1"></a>Dionysius Areopagita dicat Eugenio Marcello,  dicto, propter ingenii excellentiam, Timotheo, <i>libros</i> <i>de Divinis Nominibus</i>."</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.i.iv-p8"></a>Dionysius of Alexandria, writing to Tope Sixtus II., c. 250, respecting  the writings of Dionysius the Areopagite, affirms "that no one can intelligently  dispute their paternity--that no one penetrated more profoundly than Dionysius  into the mysterious depths of Holy Scripture--that Dionysius was disciple of St.  Paul, and piously governed the Church of Athens." If, then, the Bishops  of Alexandria and Rome exchanged letters only a few years after the death  of Pantaenus, and only seven years after the death of Ammonius, and in those letters  affirmed the writings to be undoubtedly written by Dionysius the Areopagite, it  would be the height of absurdity to affirm that such writings were unknown to Pantaenus  and Ammonius.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.i.iv-p9"></a>But we do not need to base our proof on mere  <a name="page_viii"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. viii</font></a> <a name="iv.i.iv-Page_viii"></a>supposition. Routh gives two fragments of Pantaenus.  The second is a distinct echo of Dionysius. In Divine Names (c. 7), Dionysius discusses  how Almighty God knows existing things, and explains the text; "<i>He, knowing all  things before their birth</i>" as proving that "not as learning existing things  from existing things, but from Himself, and in Himself, as Cause, the Divine Being  pre-holds and pre-comprehends the notions and essence of all things, not approaching  each several thing according to its kind, but knowing and containing all things  within one grasp of the cause. Thus Almighty God knows existing things, not by a  knowledge of existing things, but by that of Himself." Dionysius, c. V. s. 8, speaking  of creation, declares that the Divine and good <i>volitions </i>of Almighty God  define and produce existing things.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.i.iv-p10"></a>Pantaenus teaches the same: "Neither does He know things sensible  sensibly (<a name="iv.i.iv-p10.1"></a>αἰσθητῶς), nor things intelligible intellectually.  For it is not possible that He, Who is above all things, should comprehend things  being, after things being (<a name="iv.i.iv-p10.2"></a>κατὰ τα ὄντα), but  we affirm that He knows things being" as <i>His own volitions </i> . . . yea, as His  own volitions, Almighty God knows things being, since by willing (<a name="iv.i.iv-p10.3"></a>θέλων),  He made all things being."</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.i.iv-p11"></a>In Mystic Theology, c. V., Dionysius says, "Almighty God does  not know existing things, <i>qua </i>existing." The teaching of Ammonius-Saccus  is the same; Ammonius uses the word <a name="iv.i.iv-p11.1"></a>βούλημα,  Dionysius and Pantaenus, <a name="iv.i.iv-p11.2"></a>θελήματα, of God, as  Source of Creation.  <a name="page_ix"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. ix</font></a> <a name="iv.i.iv-Page_ix"></a></p> 
 <p><a name="iv.i.iv-p12"></a>But, though the known fragments of Pantaenus are few, we possess  abundant writings of two pupils, Clement of Alexandria and Origen, from which we  may gather the teaching of their master. Clement speaks of Pantaenus as his "great  instructor and collaborator." Such is the similarity between the writings of Clement  and Dionysius, that some have hazarded the conjecture that Clement the Philosopher,  mentioned by Dionysius, was Clement of Alexandria! I give only one familiar illustration.  Clement writes: "As then, those riding at anchor at sea, drag the anchor, but do  not drag it to themselves, but themselves to the anchor, thus those who are drawn  to God in the gnostic life, find themselves unconsciously led to God." Dionysius,  D. N., c. III. s. 1, says, "or, as if after we have embarked on ship, and are holding  on to the cable, attached to some rock, we do not draw the rock to us, but ourselves,  and the ship, to the rock. Wherefore, before everything, and especially theology,  we must begin with prayer; not as though we ourselves were drawing the power, which  is everywhere, and nowhere present, but as, by our godly reminiscences and invocations,  conducting ourselves to, and making ourselves one with It."</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.i.iv-p13"></a>Origen confessed that Pantaenus was his superior in the philosophy  of the schools, and that he moulded his teaching upon the model of Pantaenus. Do  the writings of Origen bear the stamp of Dionysius and Hierotheus? Origen, on the  resurrection of the body, says, "For how does it not seem absurd  <a name="page_x"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. x</font></a> <a name="iv.i.iv-Page_x"></a>that this body which has endured scars for Christ,  and, equally with the soul, has borne the savage torments of persecutions, and has  also endured the suffering of chains, and rods, and has been tortured with fire,  beaten with the sword, and has further suffered the cruel teeth of wild beasts,  the gallows of the cross, and divers kinds of punishments,--that this should be  deprived of the prizes of such contests. If forsooth, the soul alone, which not  alone contended, should receive the crown, and its companion the body, which served  it with much labour, should attain no recompense, for its agony and victory,--how  does it not seem contrary to all reason, that the flesh, resisting for Christ its  natural vices, and its innate lust, and guarding its virginity with immense labour,--that  one, when the time for rewards has come, should be rejected as unworthy and the  other should receive its crown? Such a fact would undoubtedly argue on the part  of God, either a lack of justice or a lack of power." Dionysius (E. H., c. VII.)  says, "Now the pure bodies of the holy souls, enrolled together as yoke-fellows,  and fellow travellers, which together strove during the divine contests, throughout  the Divine Life, in the unmoved steadfastness of the souls, will together receive  their own resurrection. For, having been made one with the holy souls, to which  they were united during this present life, by having become members of Christ, they  will receive in return the godlike and incorruptible immortality and blessed inheritance."  Dionysius (D. N., c. VI. s. 2) says, "what is still more  <a name="page_xi"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. xi</font></a> <a name="iv.i.iv-Page_xi"></a>divine, It promises to "transfer our whole selves  (I mean souls and bodies, their yoke-fellows), to a perfect life and immortality.  Others again do this injustice to bodies, that, after having toiled with the holy  souls, they unjustly deprive them of the holy retributions, when they have come  to the goal of their most divine course." "For if the man have passed a life dear  to God in soul and body, the body which has contended throughout the Divine struggles  will be honoured together with the devout soul."</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.i.iv-p14"></a>To shew that Origen knew the works of Hierotheus, we give an extract  from his letter to Gregory: "Would that you might both participate in and continually  augment this part, so that you may not only say, ‘we are partakers of Christ,’ but  also partakers of God." Papias <a name="fr_147"></a><a href="#fn_147"><font size="1">148</font></a>
 , Bishop of Hierapolis  (fragment V.) says, "the Presbyters, the disciples of the Apostles, say that this  is the gradation and method of those who are saved, and that they advance through  steps of this nature, and that, moreover, they ascend through the Spirit to the  Son, and through the Son to the Father; and that, in due time, the Son will yield  up His work to the Father." Who the <i>Presbyters, the disciples of </i>the Apostles  were, we may gather from the three last chapters of the "Book of Hierotheus <a name="fr_148"></a><a href="#fn_148"><font size="1">149</font></a>
 ," in which the very same doctrine is taught. Is it  not, then, a legitimate inference, that when Photius says " that  <a name="page_xii"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. xii</font></a> <a name="iv.i.iv-Page_xii"></a>Pantaenus was a pupil of <i>the Presbyters who  had seen the Apostles</i>," he designated Hierotheus and Dionysius the Areopagite,  generally known under that title?</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.i.iv-p15"></a>Ammonius Saccus was born of Christian parents in Alexandria, and  died in that city, a.d. 242.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.i.iv-p16"></a>Anastasius Sinaita calls him "the Wise," and Hierocles, "the taught  of God." Besides being famous for his expositions of Holy Scripture, he wrote the  "Diatesseron," or "Harmony of the Gospels," contained in the Bib. Patrum. In a.d.  236, he wrote the agreement between Moses and Jesus. He was the great conciliator,  who sought the good in every system, and to make all one in Christ. Pressensé beautifully  describes him as a man who wished to believe and to know--to adore and to comprehend--to  conciliate the Greek Philosophy with the Mysteries of the East. He wrote a commentary  on the golden verses of Pythagoras, which Hierocles published, as well as reproduced  his other works. The titles of his books, mentioned by Photius, such as "Providence"  and "Free Will," recall those of the lost books of Dionysius, of which we have only  a summary in his known works. (Cod. 251-214.)</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.i.iv-p17"></a>Ammonius was surnamed Saccus from having been a corn carrier.  Virgil, Shakespere, Milton, were great geniuses in themselves, but when we know  the sources from which they drew, we can better understand their achievements.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.i.iv-p18"></a>Dionysius was indebted to Hierotheus--Ammonius  <a name="page_xiii"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. xiii</font></a> <a name="iv.i.iv-Page_xiii"></a>drew from Dionysius. This we shall  shew, not as we might, by his works as described by Photius, but from Plotinus,  his disciple, in order that we may have the prevailing proof, to some minds, of  testimony not necessarily Christian.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.i.iv-p19"></a>Plotinus was born in Lycopolis, a.d. 205, and died in Campagna,  a.d. 270. At the age of 29, he began to search for truth, in the schools of Alexandria.  He wandered from teacher to teacher, but could find no rest until he was persuaded  to go and hear Ammonius-Saccus. After listening to him, he exclaimed, "This is what  I sought."</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.i.iv-p20"></a>Plotinus remained under him eleven years, until the death of Ammonius,  a.d. 242. In a.d. 244, Plotinus began to teach in Rome. Plotinus was not a refined  scholar. Porphyry, therefore, committed his teaching to writing. Porphyry was regarded  as the greatest enemy to the Christian Faith in the early centuries. Persecutors  burned the bodies of Christians, but Porphyry sought to undermine their faith in  the Holy Scriptures, by quibbles of unbelief, which have been revived to-day as  "New Criticism." Porphyry wrote against the Holy Scriptures with a bitterness engendered  by a conviction of their truth. Now, it is a startling fact, that though the teaching  of Plotinus comes to us through Porphyry, there is not a word in the Enneades, in  which the teaching of Plotinus is given, against the Christian Faith. It is true  that Eutochius published another version of the teaching of Plotinus, on the ground  that his teaching was coloured by Porphyry, but we  <a name="page_xiv"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. xiv</font></a> <a name="iv.i.iv-Page_xiv"></a>prefer to rest our proof on Porphyry, as not being  prejudiced in favour of the truth.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.i.iv-p21"></a>Let us then first see what Plotinus teaches respecting the Holy  Trinity. He says, "We need not go beyond the three <i>Hypostaseis</i>" (Persons).  It is true that Plotinus presents that Trinity as "One," "Mind," and "Soul," whereas  Dionysius gives the formula "Father, Son, and Spirit." Occasionally Plotinus uses  "Logos" instead of "Mind." But even this substitution of "One" for "Father" may  be traced to Dionysius, who speaks of the Triad, <a name="iv.i.iv-p21.1"></a>ἐναρχικὴ  and even <a name="iv.i.iv-p21.2"></a>ἐναρχικῶν ὑποστὰσεων, "<i>One </i>springing." The "One" represents the Father. Plotinus  says, "We may represent the first principle, ‘One,’ as source, which has no other  origin than Itself, and which pours Itself in a multitude of streams without being  diminished by what it gives." Dionysius speaks of the "Father" as sole source of  Godhead, and says that "the Godhead is undiminished by the gifts imparted." In Chap.  XII. of Divine Names, Dionysius treats of "One" and "Perfect" as applied to Almighty  God.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.i.iv-p22"></a>Let Us now hear Plotinus on the "Beautiful" Enneades (I. 6-7).  Plotinus says, "The soul advances in its ascent towards God, until being raised  above everything alien, it sees face to face, in His simplicity, and in all His  purity, Him upon Whom all hangs, to Whom all aspire; from Whom all hold existence,  life and thought. What transport of love must not he feel who sees Him! with what  ardour ought he not to desire to be united to Him! He,  <a name="page_xv"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. xv</font></a> <a name="iv.i.iv-Page_xv"></a>who has not seen Him, desires Him as the Good; he  who has seen Him, admires Him as the sovereign Beauty; and struck at once with astonishment  and pleasure, disdains the things which heretofore he called by the name of Beauty.  This is what happens to those to whom have appeared the forms of gods and demons;--they  no longer care For the beauty of other bodies. What think you, then, should he experience  who has seen the Beautiful Himself,--the Beautiful surpassing earth and heaven!  The miserable is not he, Who has neither fresh colour nor comely form, nor power,  nor royalty; it is alone he, Who sees himself excluded from the possession of Beauty--a  possession in comparison with which he ought to disdain royalty, rule of the whole  earth, of the sea, and heaven itself, if he should be able, by abandoning,  by despising all these, to rise to the contemplation of the Beautiful, face to face."  Plotinus also recognised, "that the eye soiled with impurity could never bear the  sight, or attain to the vision of that Beauty. We must render the organs of vision  analogous and like to the object that they would contemplate. Every man ought to  begin by rendering himself beautiful and divine to obtain a Vision of the Beautiful  and the Deity." Well might St. Augustine say, that "with the change of a few words,  Plotinus became concordant with Christ’s religion." No wonder that Gregory and Basil  quoted so largely from Plotinus. Let us now hear what Dionysius says of the "Good  and Beautiful":-- <a name="page_xvi"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. xvi</font></a> <a name="iv.i.iv-Page_xvi"></a>"Goodness turns  all things to Itself; all things aspire to It, as source and bond and end. From  this Beautiful comes being to all existing things. All things aspire to the Beautiful  and Good,--and there is no existing thing which does not participate in the Beautiful  and Good." Read the Fourth Chapter of the Divine Names.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.i.iv-p23"></a>Porphyry records that Plotinus attained to that vision of the  Beautiful three times during his life. How that vision of the Beautiful is to be  attained, Dionysius describes in the "Mystic Theology:"--"But thou, O dear Timothy,  by thy persistent commerce with the mystic visions, leave behind both sensible perceptions  and intellectual efforts, and all objects of sense and intelligence, and all things  not being and being, and be raised aloft agnostically to the union, as attainable,  with Him Who is above every essence and knowledge. For by unchecked and absolute  extasy, in all purity, from thyself, and all, thou wilt be carried on high to the  superessential Ray of the Divine Darkness, when thou hast cast away all and become  free from all." Ammonius had such extasy during his lectures, in which he seemed  to have Divine visions.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.i.iv-p24"></a>Plotinus differs from Dionysius in regarding creation as an act  of necessity, whereas Dionysius regards it as an act of love. Plotinus treats evil  as "an elongation from God." Dionysius speaks of Almighty God as immanent in matter  the most elongated from spirit. Plotinus traces evil to matter; Dionysius to the  fallacious choice of a free agent.  <a name="page_xvii"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. xvii</font></a> <a name="iv.i.iv-Page_xvii"></a>May it not be that the pagan colouring of Porphyry in these respects led Eutochius  to give a more faithful and consistent account of the teaching of Plotinus.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.i.iv-p25"></a>But the crowning proof that Dionysius was the source from which  the Alexandrine School drew much of its wisdom, is Proclus (450-485). Suidas affirmed  long ago that Proclus cribbed whole passages from Dionysius. Professor Stiglmayr  fills seven pages with parallel passages.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.i.iv-p26"></a>Vachérot describes certain chapters of the "Divine Names" as extracts  from Proclus, word for word, and says the whole doctrine of Dionysius seems to be  a commentary upon the Theology of Alexandria. Barthélémy St. Hilaire says that Dionysius  and Scotus Erigena, almost entirely implanted, in the middle age, the doctrine of  Neo-Platonism. Matter is more profound; Professor Langen finds in Dionysius the  "characteristics of Neo-Platonic speculation." The similarity of doctrine is denied  by none. Which writings appeared first? <i>that </i>is the question.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.i.iv-p27"></a>Dexter commemorates the "Divine Names" a.d. 98 <a name="fr_149"></a><a href="#fn_149"><font size="1">150</font></a>
 .</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.i.iv-p28"></a>Polycarp quotes Dionysius verbatim as "a certain one." Jerome  quotes him as "<a name="iv.i.iv-p28.1"></a>quidam Graecorum." Dionysius of Alexandria (a.d. 250), writing to  Sixtus II., declares that no one can intelligently doubt that the writings are those  of Dionysius, the convert of St. Paul, Bishop of Athens.  <a name="page_xviii"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. xviii</font></a> <a name="iv.i.iv-Page_xviii"></a>Tertullian, expresses the Agnosia "<a name="iv.i.iv-p28.2"></a>nihil scire  omnia scire," Origen quotes him by name. Theodore (a.d. 420) answers objections,--whom  Photius approved. Gregory calls Dionysius "an ancient and venerable Father."  The Second Council of Nicea quotes the very words, contained in the "Ecclesiastical  Hierarchy," c. I. s. 4, as those of the great Dionysius. Bishop Pearson proves that  the best judges in the sixth, fifth, fourth and third centuries regarded the writings  as written: by Dionysius the Areopagite. German scholars to-day admit that the external  testimony is in favour of their genuineness.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.i.iv-p29"></a>Yet eccentric critics, on account of the precise theology, cannot  believe that the works were written; by a learned Greek,--Chief of the Areopagus--who  forsook all to follow Christ,--the convert and disciple of St.. Paul,--the familiar  friend of St. John and other Apostles, to whom our Saviour revealed the mysteries  of the Father; but those critics can believe that an unknown man, whose century  no one can fix, and possibly a Syrian, may have gleaned from writers of the first  four centuries these theological pearls expressed in Greek in a style unique and  always like itself. They can, believe that the Author of these Divine writings,  would incorporate, fictitious allusions to persons and events of the apostolic,  age, to add lustre to incomparable works, and to impute them to another. They can  believe that writings, so composed, were foisted upon a credulous Christendom, so  that Dionysius of Alexandria, Maximus, St. John Damascene, and the  <a name="page_xix"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. xix</font></a> <a name="iv.i.iv-Page_xix"></a>Council of Nicea, accepted them  as the genuine works of Dipnysius. I do not belong to that school. Only unbelief  could believe anything so incredible. Rational men will not hazard the surmise that  works known in the first century were gleaned from writings composed four hundred  years afterwards.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.i.iv-p30"></a>The tone of the Alexandrine School may be further illustrated  from Amelius and Dionysius the Sublime. Amelius attended Plotinus twenty-four years  as companion and pupil. Eusebius gives an extract from his writings, in which Amelius  says, "This plainly was the Word, by Whom, being Eternal, things becoming became,  as Heraclitus would say." It was probably he who said, "the Prologue of St. John’s  Gospel ought to be written in gold, and placed in the most conspicuous place in  every church." De Civ. Dei, LX. c. 29. Dionysius, the famous secretary of Zenobia,  attended the lectures of Ammonius-Saccus. He was the "arbiter" of all literary questions.  He expresses his admiration, De sub. L. 9, of the diction of Moses in the description  of the six days’ creation, and numbers St. Paul amongst the most brilliant Greek  orators, as a man who propounded a "dogma beyond demonstration."</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.i.iv-p31"></a>We claim that the testimony of these illustrious men, and the  extracts from Pantaenus, Ammonius, and their disciples, justify the conclusion that  the Alexandrine School was Biblical, Christian, and Philosophical, that its Philosophy  was a Divine  <a name="page_xx"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. xx</font></a> <a name="iv.i.iv-Page_xx"></a>Philosophy <i>of the  Faith, </i>not a pagan philosophy <i>against the Faith, </i>and that the main sources  of its Divine Philosophy were the writings of Hierotheus and Dionysius, Bishops  of Athens.</p>
