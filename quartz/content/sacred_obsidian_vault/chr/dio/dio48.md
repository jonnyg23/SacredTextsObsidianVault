 <p align="center"><a name="iv.ii.v-p1"></a>For what reason all the Heavenly Beings are called, in common,  Angels.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.v-p2"></a>This, then, in our judgment, is the reason for the appellation  Angelic in the Oracles. We must now, I suppose, enquire for what reason the theologians  call all the Heavenly Beings together "Angels;" but when they come to a more accurate  <a name="page_22"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 22</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.v-Page_22"></a> description of the supermundane orders, they name exclusively, "angelic rank,"  that which completes the full tale of the Divine and Heavenly Hosts. Before this,  however, they range pre-eminently, the Orders of Archangels, and the Principalities,  the Authorities, and Powers, and as many Beings as the revealing traditions of the  Oracles recognize as superior to them. Now, we affirm that throughout every sacred  ordinance the superior ranks possess the illuminations and powers of their subordinates,  but the lowest have not the same powers as those who are above them. The theologians  also call the most holy ranks of the highest Beings "Angels," for they "also make  known the supremely Divine illumination. But there is no reason to call the lowest  rank of the celestial Minds, Principalities, or Thrones, or Seraphim. For it does  not possess the highest powers, but, as it conducts our inspired Hierarchs to the  splendours of the Godhead known to it; so also, the saintly powers of the Beings  above it are conductors, towards the Divine Being, of that Order which completes  the Angelic Hierarchies. Except perhaps some one might say this also, that all the  angelic appellations are common, as regards the subordinate and superior communication  of all the celestial powers towards the Divine likeness, and the gift of light from  God. But, in order that the question may be better investigated, let us reverently  examine the saintly characteristics set forth respecting each celestial Order in  the Oracles.  <a name="page_23"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 23</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.v-Page_23"></a></p>
