 <p><a name="ii.vi-p1"></a>THE most plausible objection to the genuineness of these writings  is thus expressed by Dupin: "Eusebius and Jerome wrote an accurate catalogue of  each author known to them--with a few obscure exceptions,--and yet never mention  the writings of the Areopagite." Great is the rejoicing in the House of the Anti-Areopagites  over this PROOF;--but what are the facts? Eusebius acknowledges that innumerable  works have not come to him--Jerome disclaims either to know or to give an accurate  catalogue either of authors or works. The Library of Caesarea contained three hundred  thousand volumes, according to the modest computation of Doublet, according to Schneider,  many more--Jerome says there are some writings, so illustrious in themselves,  that they will not suffer from not being mentioned by him; Jerome fallows Dionysius  on the Heavenly Hierarchy; Jerome’s Catalogue of Illustrious Men contains one hundred  and thirty-five names.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.vi-p2"></a>Josephus is mentioned for his testimony to Christ --Seneca,  for his correspondence with St, Paul--Philo, for his description of the Therapeutse  of Alexandria. Yet Dupin would have the unwary infer that Jerome gives a full catalogue  of each Author known to him, with a few obscure exceptions.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.vi-p3"></a>The "Ecclesiastical History" of Eusebius treats of  <a name="page_203"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 203</font></a> <a name="ii.vi-Page_203"></a>the nature of Christ, the companions of the Apostles, the Martyrdoms--the  succession of Bishops--the persecutions--the folk-lore of the Church to the  fourth Century. The Book would fill about 125 pages, yet Dupin would have us believe  that he gives a complete catalogue; He does not give the writings of Hymenseus and  Narcissus, of Athenagoras, and Pantaenus, nor a complete list of Clement, Origen,  and Dionysius of Alexandria. His silence, in my opinion, is owing to "odium theologicum."  According to Eusebius, Jesus is <a name="ii.vi-p3.1"></a>διττός; according to  Dionysius, Jesus is <a name="ii.vi-p3.2"></a>ἁπλοῦς; both true when properly  understood, but when misunderstood--"<a name="ii.vi-p3.3"></a>Hinc lachrymae illae"--Dupin formed his  premise for his conclusion, not from facts <a name="fr_139"></a><a href="#fn_139"><font size="1">140</font></a>
 .</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.vi-p4"></a>FALLACY OF NAMES.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.vi-p5"></a>Pearson, Daillé, Blundellum, Erasmus, Valla, Westcott, Lupton,  pronounce against the genuineness. Who are you? But Pearson demolishes Daillé; Vossius  pulverises Blundellum; Erasmus repudiates Valla. Dr. Westcott, following Dupin,  assumes the non-genuineness, but his literary instinct places his Article on Dionysius  before that on Origen. Dean Colet bumps the scale against Mr. Lupton.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.vi-p6"></a>Pearson, in the xth Chapter of Ignatii Vindiciae, gives the shortest  and best summary in favour of the genuineness. Speaking of the scholars of his own  day, he says, "No one is so ignorant as not to know that these writings were recognised  as genuine by the  <a name="page_204"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 204</font></a> <a name="ii.vi-Page_204"></a> best judges in the sixth, fifth, fourth, and third centuries." Unhappily,  he also said, Every "erudite" person regarded them in his day as written in the  fourth century, and he assumed the date of Eusebius’ death, as the date of the works,  to account for his silence. Hence every inerudite person, who wished to pass for  erudite, maintained that opinion for his own reputation. But when Pearson had re-surveyed  the evidence, he confessed, with shame, that though he had given, what seemed to  him a true opinion, he left the decision of the whole matter to the judgment of  a more learned person.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.vi-p7"></a>Erasmus, in his "Institutio" of a Christian Prince, writes thus:--"<a name="ii.vi-p7.1"></a>Divus  ille Dionysius qui fecit tres Hierarchias." In his prime work, "<a name="ii.vi-p7.2"></a>ratio verae religionis,"  Erasmus not only enumerates the "Divine Names," the "Mystic and Symbolic Theology,"  but calls them, not Stoic, not Platonic, not Aristotelian, but "celestial" philosophy.  He so moulds Dionysius into his book, that it becomes Dionysius writing elegant  Latin. The only reason which outweighed with him all external testimony, was, that  Erasmus could not imagine that any man, living in apostolic times, and so far removed  from the age of Erasmus, could possibly have penned such a mirror of apostolic doctrine.  How could the Areopagite, though disciple of Paul, and familiar friend of John Theologus,  possibly be so learned as the author of these writings? Such is the testimony of  the two Theologians who have been permitted to be doubtful of the genuineness.  <a name="page_205"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 205</font></a> <a name="ii.vi-Page_205"></a></p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.vi-p8"></a>GREGORY OF TOURS <a name="fr_140"></a><a href="#fn_140"><font size="1">141</font></a>
 .</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.vi-p9"></a>Gregory is the great authority of those who think that the St.  Denis of France is not identical with Dionysius the Areopagite. The authority is  worthy of their critical acumen. Gregory collects the more obscure martyrdoms, in  Gaul, under Nero, and subsequent Emperors. He gives several martyrdoms under Nero,  and thus proves the Apostolic Evangelisation of Gaul. Gregory quotes, and misquotes,  and misunderstands the ancient document <a name="fr_141"></a><a href="#fn_141"><font size="1">142</font></a>
 , "Concerning <a name="fr_142"></a><a href="#fn_142"><font size="1">143</font></a>
   seven men sent by St. Peter into Gaul,--in  Gallias--to preach." "Under Claudius --sub CLDIO--Peter the Apostle sent certain  disciples into Gaul to preach,--they were, Trophimus, Paulus, Martial, Austremonius,  Gatianus, Saturninus, Valerius, and many companions."--These men were sent A.D.  42–43. Gregory omits Valerius, and inserts Dionysius --who was not converted  to the Christian Faith till A.D. 44 or 49. Then Gregory misreads "Claudio "for "consulibus  Decio," and adds, "Grato" as the fellow-consul. Thus a disciple of the Apostles,  sent by Clement, successor of Peter, arrives in Gaul A.D. 250, and the identical  names of his companions recur miraculously in the third century. At the very time  that Trophimus <a name="fr_143"></a><a href="#fn_143"><font size="1">144</font></a>
  is thus supposed to have arrived at  Aries, we have a letter from Cyprian, A.D. 254, urging Pope Stephen to depose Marcion,  15th or<a name="page_206"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 206</font></a> <a name="ii.vi-Page_206"></a> 18th Bishop of Aries from Trophimus. Such is the basis upon  which our critical friends build their house upon the sand.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.vi-p10"></a>THE PÈRES BOLANDISTES.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.vi-p11"></a>The Pères Bolandistes are a wonder in Christendom. They are critical,  and yet follow the gross blunder of Gregory of Tours. They belong to the papal obedience,  and yet prefer Gregory of Tours when wrong, to Gregory XIII., when right. They pronounce  the solemn declaration of Pope John XIXth, "that Martial of Limoges was an apostolic  man <a name="fr_144"></a><a href="#fn_144"><font size="1">145</font></a>
 ," as of no historic value. They think that St.  John Damascene did not possess the same critical apparatus for proving the authenticity  of the writings of Dionysius, that we possess in the xixth Century. Their "<a name="ii.vi-p11.2"></a>actes  authentiques <a name="fr_145"></a><a href="#fn_145"><font size="1">146</font></a>
 " of Dionysius acknowledge that  he was sent to Gaul by Clement, successor of Peter; and yet they affirm that he  arrived in Gaul, A.D, 250. After Clement I., who succeeded Peter and Paul, there  was not another Clement, Bishop of Rome, for a thousand years <a name="fr_146"></a><a href="#fn_146"><font size="1">147</font></a>
 . Happily, Les petits Bolandistes are more rational and critical than  their Pères.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.vi-p12"></a>GENERAL OBJECTION.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.vi-p13"></a>"The style, the theological learning, the language and allusions,  prove the writings written after the apostolic age." <a name="page_207"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 207</font></a> <a name="ii.vi-Page_207"></a></p> 
 <p><a name="ii.vi-p14"></a>Is the Epistolary style the proof? St. Paul, St. John, St. Peter,  St. Luke, and nearly the whole of the New Testament is written under the form of  Epistles. The Epistle of St. James,--the first written in the Canon of the New  Testament,--will bear comparison with the book of Job for ornate diction. Consult  the marginal references to the Epistle of St. Peter, to see the scriptural knowledge  of the Apostles. Men use the testimony of the High Priests, that the Apostles were  unlearned and ignorant men, but omit their testimony that they took knowledge of  them, that they had been with Jesus; and the further testimony, that Jesus opened  their understanding, that they should understand the testimony of the Scriptures,  respecting Himself; and further, that the Holy Spirit should recall to them whatever  He had said to them. Those who would rather assume twenty miracles, than acknowledge  one natural fact, surmise, that a Syrian, in the ivth century, may have written  Greek permeated with technical expressions of Plato and Aristotle. <i>There is not  a single allusion to persons or events after the first century, </i>unless it be  supposed that the Epistle of Ignatius, A.D. 108, is quoted. The works abound in  names recorded in the New Testament. The Apostolic Epistles allude to the leaven  of heresy already working. The Antwerp edition gives about five hundred references  to Holy Scripture in the Writings of Dionysius. He quotes every book in the Bible,  except the two last particular Epistles of St. John, or John Presbyter. Dionysius  writes  <a name="page_208"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 208</font></a> <a name="ii.vi-Page_208"></a> four letters to Gaius, to whom St. John wrote his third Epistle.  We have, therefore, in the writings of this Apostolic man, a proof that the Canonical  Scriptures were quoted as the Oracles of God, in the first century, and a triumphant  testimony that</p>
