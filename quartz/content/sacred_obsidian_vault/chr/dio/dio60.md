 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.ii-p1"></a><a name="iv.iii.ii-p1.1"></a>I. Concerning things done in Illumination.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p2"></a>We have, then, reverently affirmed that this is the purpose of our Hierarchy,  viz., our assimilation and union with God, as far as attainable. And, as the Divine  Oracles teach, we shall attain this only by the love and the religious performance  of the most worshipful Commandments. For He says: "He <a name="fr_228"></a><a href="#fn_228"><font size="1">229</font></a>
   that loveth Me will keep My Word, and My Father will love him, and we will come  unto him, and will make Our abode with him." What, then, is source of the religious  performance of the most august commandments? Our preparation for the restitution  of the supercelestial rest, which forms the habits of our souls into an aptitude  for the reception of the other sacred sayings and doings <a name="fr_229"></a><a href="#fn_229"><font size="1">230</font></a>
 ,  the transmission of our holy and most divine regeneration <a name="fr_230"></a><a href="#fn_230"><font size="1">231</font></a>
 .  For, as our illustrious Leader used  <a name="page_75"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 75</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.ii-Page_75"></a>to say, the very first movement of the mind towards Divine things is the willing reception  of Almighty God, but the very earliest step of the religious reception towards the  religious performance of the Divine commandments is the unutterable operation of  our being from God. For if our <a name="fr_231"></a><a href="#fn_231"><font size="1">232</font></a>
  being from God is the  Divine engendering, never would he know, and certainly never perform, any of the  Divine instructions, who had not had his beginning to be in God. To speak after  the manner of men, must we not first begin to be, and then to do, our affairs? Since  he, who does not exist at all, has neither movement nor even beginning; since he,  who in some way exists, alone does, or suffers, those things suitable to his own  nature. This, then, as I think, is clear. Let us next contemplate the Divine symbols  of the birth in God. And I pray, let no uninitiated person approach the sight <a name="fr_232"></a><a href="#fn_232"><font size="1">233</font></a>
 ; for neither is it without danger to gaze upon the  glorious rays of the sun with weak eyes, nor is it without peril to put our hand  to things above us. For right was the priesthood of the Law, when rejecting Osias,  because he put his hand to sacred things; and Korah, because to things sacred above  his capacity; and Nadab and Abihu, because they treated things, within their own  province, unholily.  <a name="page_76"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 76</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.ii-Page_76"></a></p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.ii-p3"></a><a name="iv.iii.ii-p3.1"></a>II. Mysterion of Illumination.</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.ii-p4"></a>Section I.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p5"></a>The Hierarch, then, wishing that all men whatsoever should be saved by their  assimilation towards God, and come to recognition of truth, proclaims to all the  veritable Good News, that God being compassionate towards those upon earth, out  of His own proper and innate goodness, deigned Himself to come to us with outstretched  arms, by reason of loving-kindness towards men; and, by the union with Him, to assimilate,  like as by fire, things that have been made one, in proportion to their aptitude  for deification. "For as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become children  of God--to those who believe on His Name, who were begotten, not of bloods, nor  of will of flesh, but of God <a name="fr_233"></a><a href="#fn_233"><font size="1">234</font></a>
 ."</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.ii-p6"></a>Section II.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p7"></a>He, who has felt a religious longing to participate in these truly supermundane  gifts, comes to some one of the initiated, and persuades him to act as his conductor  to the Hierarch. He then professes wholly to follow the teaching that shall be given  to him, and prays him to undertake the superintendence of his introduction, and  of all his after life. Now he, though religiously longing for his salvation, when  he measures human infirmity against the loftiness of the undertaking, is suddenly  seized  <a name="page_77"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 77</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.ii-Page_77"></a>with a shivering and sense of incapacity,  nevertheless, at last, he agrees, with a good grace, to do what is requested, and  takes and leads him to the chief Hierarch.</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.ii-p8"></a>Section III.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p9"></a>He, then, when with joy he has received, as the sheep upon his shoulders, the  two men, and has first worshipped, glorifies with a mental thanksgiving and bodily  prostration the One beneficent Source, from Which, those who are being called, are  called, and those who are being saved, are saved.</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.ii-p10"></a>Section IV.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p11"></a>Then collecting a full religious assembly into the sacred place, for co-operation,  and common rejoicing over the man’s salvation, and for thanksgiving for the Divine  Goodness, he first chants a certain hymn, found in the Oracles, accompanied by the  whole body of the Church; and after this, when he has kissed the holy table, he  advances to the man before him, and demands of him, what has brought him here?</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.ii-p12"></a>Section V.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p13"></a>When the man, out of love to God, has confessed, according to the instruction  of his sponsor, his ungodliness, his ignorance of the really beautiful, his insufficiency  for the life in God, and prays, through his holy mediation, to attain to God and  Divine things, he (the Hierarch) testifies to him, that his approach ought to be  entire, as to God Who is All Perfect, and without  <a name="page_78"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 78</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.ii-Page_78"></a> blemish; and when he has expounded to  him fully the godly course of life, and has demanded of him, if he would thus live,--after  his promise he places his right hand upon his head, and when he has sealed him,  commands the priests to register the man and his sponsor.</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.ii-p14"></a>Section VI.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p15"></a>When these have enrolled the names, he makes a holy prayer, and when the whole  Church have completed this with him, he looses his sandals, and removes his clothing,  through the Leitourgoi. Then, when he has placed him facing the west and beating  his hands, averted towards the same quarter, he commands him thrice to breathe scorn  upon Satan, and further, to profess the words of the renunciation. When he has witnessed  his threefold renunciation, he turns him back to the east, after he has professed  this thrice; and when he has looked up to heaven, and extended his hands thitherward,  he commands him to be enrolled under Christ, and all the Divinely transmitted Oracles  of God. When the man has done this, he attests again for him his threefold profession,  and again, when he has thrice professed, after prayer, he gives thanks, and lays  his hand upon him.</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.ii-p16"></a>Section VII.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p17"></a>When the Deacons have entirely unclothed him, the Priests bring the holy oil  of the anointing. Then he begins the anointing, through the threefold sealing, and  for the rest assigns the man to the Priests, for the anointing of his whole body,  while himself  <a name="page_79"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 79</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.ii-Page_79"></a>advances to the mother of filial adoption,  and when he has purified the water within it by the holy invocations, and perfected  it by three cruciform effusions of the altogether most pure Muron <a name="fr_234"></a><a href="#fn_234"><font size="1">235</font></a>
 , and by the same number of injections of the all holy Muron, and  has invoked the sacred melody of the inspiration of the God-rapt Prophets, he orders  the man to be brought forward; and when one of the Priests, from the register, has  announced him <a name="fr_235"></a><a href="#fn_235"><font size="1">236</font></a>
  and his surety, he is conducted by  the Priests near the water to the hand of the Hierarch, being led by the hand to  him. Then the Hierarch, standing above, when the Priests have again called aloud  near the Hierarch within the water the name of the initiated, the Hierarch dips  him three times, invoking the threefold Subsistence of the Divine Blessedness, at  the three immersions and emersions of the initiated. The Priests then take him,  and entrust him to the Sponsor and guide of his introduction; and when they, in  conjunction with him, have cast over the initiated appropriate clothing, they lead  him again to the Hierarch, who, when he has sealed the man with the most Divinely  operating Muron, pronounces him to be henceforward partaker of the most Divinely  initiating Eucharist.  <a name="page_80"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 80</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.ii-Page_80"></a></p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.ii-p18"></a>Section VIII.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p19"></a>When he has finished these things, he elevates himself from his progression to  things secondary, to the contemplation of things <a name="fr_236"></a><a href="#fn_236"><font size="1">237</font></a>
   first, as one, who, at no time or manner, turns himself to any other thing whatever  than those which are peculiarly his own, but from things Divine to Divine,--is  persistently and always ranging himself under the banner of the supremely Divine  Spirit.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.ii-p20"></a><a name="iv.iii.ii-p20.1"></a>III. Contemplation.</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.ii-p21"></a>Section I.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p22"></a>This initiation, then, of the holy birth in God, as in symbols, has nothing unbecoming  or irreverent, nor anything of the sensible images, but (contains) enigmas of a  contemplation worthy of God, likened to physical and human images. For how should  it appear misleading? Even when the very divine meaning of the things done is passed  over in silence, <a name="fr_237"></a><a href="#fn_237"><font size="1">238</font></a>
  the divine Instruction might convince,  religiously pursuing as it does the good life of the candidate, enjoining upon him  the purification from every kind of evil, through a virtuous and Divine life, by  the physical cleansing through the agency of water in a bodily form. This symbolic  teaching then of the things done, even if it had nothing more divine, would not  be without religious value, as I think, introducing a discipline of a well-regulated  life, and. suggesting mysteriously, through the total bodily  <a name="page_81"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 81</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.ii-Page_81"></a>purification by water, the complete purification from the evil life.</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.ii-p23"></a>Section II.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p24"></a>Let this, then, be, for the uninitiated, a conducting guidance of the soul, which  separates, as is meet things sacred and uniform from multiplicity, and apportions  the harmonious elevation to the Orders severally in turn. But we, who have ascended  by sacred gradations to the sources of the things performed, and have been religiously  taught these (sources), shall recognize of what moulds they are the reliefs, and  of what invisible things they are the likenesses. For, as is distinctly shewn in  the Treatise concerning "Intelligible and Sensible," sacred things in sensible forms  are copies of things intelligible, to which they lead and shew the way; and things  intelligible are source and science of things hierarchical cognizable by the senses.</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.ii-p25"></a>Section III.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p26"></a>Let us affirm, then, that the goodness of the Divine Blessedness is always in  the same condition and manner, unfolding the beneficent rays of its own light upon  all the intellectual visions without grudging. Should, then, the self-choosing self-sufficiency  of the contemplators either turn away from the light contemplated, by closing, through  love of evil, the faculties for enlightenment naturally implanted within it, it  would be separated from the light present to  <a name="page_82"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 82</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.ii-Page_82"></a> it, not turned away, but shining upon  it when shortsighted and turning its face from light generously running to it; or  should it overstep the bounds of the visible given to it in due proportion, and  rashly undertake to gaze upon the rays superior to its vision, the light indeed  will do nothing beyond its proper functions, but it, by imperfectly approaching  thing’s perfect, would not attain to things unsuitable, and, by stupidly disregarding  the due proportion, would fail through its own fault.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p27"></a>But, as I said, the Divine Light is always unfolded beneficently to the intellectual  visions, and it is possible for them to seize it when present, and always being  most ready for the distribution of things appropriate, in a manner becoming God.  To this imitation the divine Hierarch is fashioned, unfolding to all, without grudging,  the luminous rays of his inspired teaching, and, after the Divine example, being  most ready to enlighten the proselyte, neither using a grudging nor an unholy wrath  for former back-slidings or excess, but, after the example of God, always enlightening  by his conducting light those who approach him, as becomes a Hierarch, in fitness,  and order, and in proportion to the aptitude of each for holy things.</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.ii-p28"></a>Section IV.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p29"></a>But, inasmuch as the Divine Being is source of sacred order, within which the  holy Minds regulate themselves, he, who recurs to the proper view of  <a name="page_83"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 83</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.ii-Page_83"></a> Nature, will see his proper self in what  he was originally, and will acquire this, as the first holy gift, from his recovery  to the light. Now he, who has well looked upon his own proper condition with unbiassed  eyes, will depart from the gloomy recesses of ignorance, but being imperfect he  will not, of his own accord, at once desire the most perfect union and participation  of God, but little by little will be carried orderly and reverently through things  present to things more forward, and through these to things foremost, and when perfected,  to the supremely Divine summit. An illustration of this decorous and sacred order  is the modesty of the proselyte, and his prudence in his own affairs in having the  sponsor as leader of the way to the Hierarch. The Divine Blessedness receives the  man, thus conducted, into communion with Itself, and imparts to him the proper light  as a kind of sign, making him godly and sharer of the inheritance of the godly,  and sacred ordering; of which things the Hierarch’s seal, given to the proselyte,  and the saving enrolment of the priests are a sacred symbol, registering him amongst  those who are being saved, and placing in the sacred memorials, beside himself also  his sponsor,--the one indeed, as a true lover of the life-giving way to truth  and a companion of a godly guide, and the other, as an unerring conductor of his  follower by the Divinely-taught directions.  <a name="page_84"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 84</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.ii-Page_84"></a></p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.ii-p30"></a>Section V.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p31"></a>Yet it is not possible to hold, conjointly, qualities thoroughly opposed, nor  that a man who has had a certain fellowship with the One should have divided lives,  if he clings to the firm participation in the One; but he must be resistless and  resolute, as regards all separations from the uniform. This it is which the teaching  of the symbols reverently and enigmatically intimates, by stripping the proselyte,  as it were, of his former life, and discarding to the very utmost the habits within  that life, makes him stand naked and barefoot, looking away towards the west, whilst  he spurns, by the aversion of his hands, the participations in the gloomy baseness,  and breathes out, as it were, the habit of dissimilarity which he had acquired,  and professes the entire renunciation of everything contrary to the Divine likeness.  When the man has thus become invincible and separate from evil, it turns him towards  the east, declaring clearly that his position and recovery will be purely in the  Divine Light, in the complete separation from baseness; and receiving his sacred  promises of entire consort with the One, since he has become uniform through love  of the truth. Yet it is pretty evident, as I think, to those versed in Hierarchical  matters, that things intellectual acquire the unchangeableness of the Godlike habit,  by continuous and persistent struggles towards one, and by the entire destruction  and annihilation of  <a name="page_85"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 85</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.ii-Page_85"></a> things contrary. For it is necessary  that a man should not only depart from every kind of baseness, but he must be also  bravely obdurate and ever fearless against the baneful submission to it. Nor must  he, at any time, become remiss in his sacred love of the truth, but with all his  power persistently and perpetually be elevated towards it, always religiously pursuing  his upward course, to the more perfect mysteries of the Godhead.</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.ii-p32"></a>Section VI.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p33"></a>Now you may see the distinct illustrations of these things in the religious rites  performed by the Hierarch. For the Godlike Hierarch starts with the holy anointing,  and the Priests under him complete the Divine service of the Chrism, summoning in  type the man initiated to the holy contests, within which he is placed under Christ  as Umpire: since, as God, He is Institutor of the awards of contest, and as wise,  He placed its laws, and as generous, the prizes suitable to the victors. And this  is yet more Divine, since as good, He devotedly entered the lists with them, contending,  on behalf of their freedom and victory, for their power over death and  destruction, he who is being initiated will enter the contests, as those  of God, rejoicing, and abides by the regulations of the Wise, and contends according  to them, without transgression holding  <a name="page_86"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 86</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.ii-Page_86"></a> fast the hope of the beautiful rewards,  as being enrolled under a good Lord and Leader of the awards: and when after following  in the Divine footsteps of the first of athletes, through goodness, he has overthrown,  in his struggles after the Divine example, the energies and impulses opposed to  his deification, he dies with Christ--to speak mystically --to sin, in Baptism.</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.ii-p34"></a>Section VII.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p35"></a>And consider attentively, I pray, with what appropriateness the holy symbols  are presented. For since death is with us not an annihilation of being, as others  surmise, but the separating of things united, leading to that which is invisible  to us, the soul indeed becoming invisible through deprivation of the body, and the  body, through being buried in earth in consequence of one of its bodily changes,  becoming invisible to human ken, appropriately, the whole covering by water would  be taken as an image of death, and the invisible tomb. The symbolical teaching,  then, reveals in mystery that the man baptized according to religious rites, imitates,  so far as Divine imitation is attainable to men, by the three immersions in the  water, the supremely Divine death of the Life-giving Jesus, Who spent three days  and three nights in the tomb, in Whom, according to the mystical and secret teaching  of the sacred text, the Prince of the world found nothing.  <a name="page_87"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 87</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.ii-Page_87"></a></p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.ii-p36"></a>Section VIII.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p37"></a>Next, they throw garments, white as light, over the man initiated. For by his  manly and Godlike insensibility to contrary passions, and by his persistent inclination  towards the One, the unadorned is adorned, and the shapeless takes shape, being  made brilliant by his luminous life.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p38"></a>But the perfecting unction of the Muron makes the man initiated of good odour,  for the holy perfecting of the Divine birth unites those who have been perfected  to the supremely Divine Spirit. Now the overshadowing which makes intelligibly of  a good savour, and perfect, as being most unutterable, I leave to the mental consciousness  of those who are deemed worthy of the sacred and deifying participation of the Holy  Spirit within their mind.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p39"></a>At the conclusion of all, the Hierarch calls the man initiated to the most Holy  Eucharist, and imparts to him the communion of the perfecting mysteries.</p>
