 <p><a name="an_xlviii-p3"></a>That by indiscretion in this, men shall keep discretion in all other things; and surely else never</p>  
 <p><a name="an_xlviii-p4"></a><i> </i></p>  
 <p><a name="an_xlviii-p5"></a>BUT peradventure thou askest me, how thou shalt govern thee discreetly in meat and in sleep, and in all these other. And hereto I think to answer thee right shortly: “Get that thou get mayest.” Do this work evermore without ceasing and without discretion, and thou shalt well ken begin and cease in all other works with a great discretion. For I may not trow that a soul continuing in this work night and day without discretion, should err in any of these outward doings; and else, me think that he should always err. <a name="an_xlviii-p5.1"></a><a name="page_206"><font size="1" color="green">p. 206</font></a> <a name="an_xlviii-Page_206"></a> </p>  
 <p><a name="an_xlviii-p6"></a>And therefore, an I might get a waking and a busy beholding to this ghostly work within in my soul, I would then have a heedlessness in eating and in drinking, in sleeping and in speaking, and in all mine outward doings. For surely I trow I should rather come to discretion in them by such a heedlessness, than by any busy beholding to the same things, as I would by that beholding set a mark and a measure by them. Truly I should never bring it so about, for ought that I could do or say. Say what men say will, and let the proof witness. And therefore lift up thine heart with a blind stirring of love; and mean now sin, and now God. God wouldest thou have, and sin wouldest thou lack. God wanteth thee; and sin art thou sure of. Now good God help thee, for now hast thou need! <a name="an_xlviii-p6.1"></a><a name="page_207"><font size="1" color="green">p. 207</font></a> <a name="an_xlviii-Page_207"></a> </p>
