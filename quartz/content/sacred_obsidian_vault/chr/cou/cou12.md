 <p><a name="an_xiii"></a> </p>  
 <p><a name="an_xiii-p1"></a> </p>  <h3 align="center"><a name="an_xiii-p1.1"></a>HERE BEGINNETH THE SEVENTH CHAPTER</h3>  
 <p><a name="an_xiii-p2"></a> </p>  
 <p><a name="an_xiii-p3"></a>How a man shall have him in this work against all thoughts, and specially against all those that arise of his own curiosity, of cunning, and of natural wit.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_xiii-p4"></a> </p>  
 <p><a name="an_xiii-p5"></a>AND if any thought rise and will press continually above thee betwixt thee and that darkness, and ask thee saying, “What seekest thou, and what wouldest thou have?” say thou, that it is God that thou wouldest have. “Him I covet, Him I seek, and nought but Him.”</p>  
 <p><a name="an_xiii-p6"></a>And if he ask thee, “What is that God?” say thou, that it is God that made thee and bought thee, and that graciously hath called thee to thy degree. “And in Him,” say, “thou hast no skill.” And therefore say, “Go thou down again,” and tread him <a name="an_xiii-p6.1"></a><a name="page_91"><font size="1" color="green">p. 91</font></a> <a name="an_xiii-Page_91"></a> fast down with a stirring of love, although he seem to thee right holy, and seem to thee as he would help thee to seek Him. For peradventure he will bring to thy mind diverse full fair and wonderful points of His kindness, and say that He is full sweet, and full loving, full gracious, and full merciful. And if thou wilt hear him, he coveteth no better; for at the last he will thus jangle ever more and more till he bring thee lower, to the mind of His Passion.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_xiii-p7"></a>And there will he let thee see the wonderful kindness of God, and if thou hear him, he careth for nought better. For soon after he will let thee see thine old wretched living, and peradventure in seeing and thinking thereof he will bring to thy mind some place that thou hast dwelt in before this time. So that at the last, or ever thou wit, thou shalt be scattered thou wottest not where. The cause of this scattering is, that thou heardest him first wilfully, then answeredest <a name="an_xiii-p7.1"></a><a name="page_92"><font size="1" color="green">p. 92</font></a> <a name="an_xiii-Page_92"></a> him, receivedest him, and lettest him alone.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_xiii-p8"></a>And yet, nevertheless, the thing that he said was both good and holy. Yea, and so holy, that what man or woman that weeneth to come to contemplation without many such sweet meditations of their own wretchedness, the passion, the kindness, and the great goodness, and the worthiness of God coming before, surely he shall err and fail of his purpose. And yet, nevertheless, it behoveth a man or a woman that hath long time been used in these meditations, nevertheless to leave them, and put them and hold them far down under the cloud of forgetting, if ever he shall pierce the cloud of unknowing betwixt him and his God. Therefore what time that thou purposest thee to this work, and feelest by grace that thou art called of God, lift then up thine heart unto God with a meek stirring of love; and mean God that made thee, and bought thee, and that graciously hath called thee to thy <a name="an_xiii-p8.1"></a><a name="page_93"><font size="1" color="green">p. 93</font></a> <a name="an_xiii-Page_93"></a> degree, and receive none other thought of God. And yet not all these, but if thou list; for it sufficeth enough, a naked intent direct unto God without any other cause than Himself.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_xiii-p9"></a>And if thee list have this intent lapped and folden in one word, for thou shouldest have better hold thereupon, take thee but a little word of one syllable: for so it is better than of two, for ever the shorter it is the better it accordeth with the work of the Spirit. And such a word is this word GOD or this word LOVE. Choose thee whether thou wilt, or another; as thee list, which that thee liketh best of one syllable. And fasten this word to thine heart, so that it never go thence for thing that befalleth.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_xiii-p10"></a>This word shall be thy shield and thy spear, whether thou ridest on peace or on war. With this word, thou shalt beat on this cloud and this darkness above thee. With this word, thou shall smite down all manner of <a name="an_xiii-p10.1"></a><a name="page_94"><font size="1" color="green">p. 94</font></a> <a name="an_xiii-Page_94"></a> thought under the cloud of forgetting. Insomuch, that if any thought press upon thee to ask thee what thou wouldest have, answer them with no more words but with this one word. And if he proffer thee of his great clergy to expound thee that word and to tell thee the conditions of that word, say him: That thou wilt have it all whole, and not broken nor undone. And if thou wilt hold thee fast on this purpose, be thou sure, he will no while abide. And why? For that thou wilt not let him feed him on such sweet meditations of God touched before. <a name="an_xiii-p10.2"></a><a name="page_95"><font size="1" color="green">p. 95</font></a> <a name="an_xiii-Page_95"></a> </p>
