 <p class="c22"><a name="ii.v.xlvii-p2"></a>To Syagrius, Bishop.</p> 
 <p class="c23"><a name="ii.v.xlvii-p3"></a>Gregory to Syagrius, Bishop of Augustodunum (<i>Autun</i>).</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.v.xlvii-p4"></a>Mistress of all good things is charity, which savours of nothing extraneous, nothing rough, nothing confused; which so exercises and strengthens hearts that nothing is heavy, nothing difficult, but all that is done becomes sweet.  Since, then, it is its peculiar quality to foster things that are concordant, to preserve things that are united, to join together things that are dissociated, to set right things that are wrong, and to consolidate all other virtues by the bulwark of its own perfection, whosoever grafts himself into its roots neither falls away from greenness, nor becomes empty of fruits, because effective work loses not the moisture of fecundity.  And so I am much <a name="page_28"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 28</font></a> <a name="ii.v.xlvii-Page_28"></a>delighted with thee, and rejoice with thee in the Lord, most beloved brother, for that I find thee, by the testimony of many, so endowed with this same charity that thou both thyself becomingly exhibitest what befits a priest, and laudably shewest an example for imitation to others.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.v.xlvii-p5"></a>Inasmuch, then, as in the work of preaching (which after long thought I have taken care to supply to the nation of the Angli through Augustine, then provost (<i>præpositum</i>) of my monastery, and now our brother and fellow-bishop), I have found thee to be, as was right, so solicitous, devoted, and in all ways helpful, as to lay me under a great debt to thee in this matter, therefore moved by the consideration of so great an obligation, I cannot bear to put aside thy Fraternitys petition, lest I should appear towards thee unprofitable.  Consequently, according to the tenor of thy request, we have provided under God for thy being dignified by the use of the pallium <a name="fr_68"></a><a href="#fn_68"><font size="1">69</font></a>
 , to be worn within thy church, in the celebration of mass only.  Nevertheless we have decided that it should be given thee only on condition of thy first promising to amend by the definition of a synod the things that we have ordered to be corrected; for we certainly deem it fit that, with the gravity of mind in which by the mercy of God we have learnt that thou excellest, a more distinguished adornment of outward apparel should accrue to thee; especially as we think that thou hast asked for it, not with a view to the pomp of needless elation but with regard to the character and dignity of thy Church.  And, lest in this vestment we should seem to be bestowing as it were a bare bounty, we have taken thought at the same time for the granting of this also;—that, while the Metropolitan has in all respects his place and dignity preserved to him, the Church of Augustodunum should be next after the Church of Lugdunum (<i>Lyons</i>), and should claim to itself this place and rank by the indulgence of our authority.  But as to the other bishops, we decree that they shall take their places according to the date of their ordination, whether for sitting in council, or for subscribing, or in any other matter, and shall claim to themselves the prerogative of their several ranks:  for it seems to us consonant to reason that with the use of the pallium we should together with it, as we have said, bestow some privileges.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.v.xlvii-p7"></a>But, since with augmentation of dignity the sense of responsibility ought also to increase, that the adornments of action may agree with the decoration of vestments, your Fraternity should exercise yourself the more earnestly in all your pursuits.  Be vigilant with regard to the doings of those who are under you; let your example be their instruction, and your life their teacher.  By the exhortation of your tongue let them learn what to fear, and be taught what to love; that, when thou givest up the talents entrusted to thee with multiplied gain, in the day of retribution thou mayest be counted worthy to hear, <i>Well done, good and faithful servant:  enter thou into the joy of thy lord</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#023">Matth. xxv. 23</a><a name="ii.v.xlvii-p7.1"></a>).</p>
