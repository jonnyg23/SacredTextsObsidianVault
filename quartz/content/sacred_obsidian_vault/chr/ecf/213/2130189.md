 <p class="c23"><a name="iii.iv.xiii-p2"></a>1.  I will call in my affliction, on the Power that subdues all;—that is able to subdue, the Captor in his wrath,—as it overcame Legion.<i>  R., Glory to His grace!</i></p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xiii-p3"></a>2.  The Evil One has repaid me my brethren, debts that he borrowed not of me:—the good <i>God</i> likewise has repaid me, mercies that I lent Him not.—Come and marvel ye at these two things!</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xiii-p4"></a>3.  The good <i>God</i> has divided and given, my misdeeds to His grace,—my offences to His justice; His mercy has blotted out my misdeeds—His judgment has requited my offences.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xiii-p5"></a>4.  Sin was exceeding wroth, and abode in alarm,—when she saw how grace, put restraint on freedom, that she might overcome transgressions.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xiii-p6"></a>5.  Glow Thou, O my Lord, and send down Thy love, break out and pour forth Thy wrath!—Thy wrath to destroy, Thy love to rescue—the captives from the captor!</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xiii-p7"></a>6.  The days wherein the Evil One, decreed to cast me forth,—as with a sling into perdition, in them the good God has bound up and kept—my soul in the bundle of life.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xiii-p8"></a>7.  The men of speech who keep not silence, from praising continually,—who have kept me in the midst of waves, and supported me that I fell not, let them give praise in my stead, O my Lord!</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xiii-p9"></a>8.  For who has at any time sufficed, in presence of the grace,—of the mercies which surrounded him, that I should suffice to praise—the mercies that encompass me?</p>
