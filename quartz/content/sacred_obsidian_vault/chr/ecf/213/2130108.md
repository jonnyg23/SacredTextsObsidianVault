 <p class="c18"><a name="ii.vii.xxvi-p2"></a><i>To Theodebert, King of the Franks</i> <a name="fr_170"></a><a href="#fn_170"><font size="1">171</font></a>

 <p class="c23"><a name="ii.vii.xxvi-p4"></a>Gregory to Theodebert, &amp;c.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.vii.xxvi-p5"></a>One who receives with willing mind and embraces in the bosom of his heart words of fatherly admonition declares himself without doubt to be one who would be an amender of faults.  On which account the absolute promise of your Excellence assures us sufficiently.  For we hold in place of a pledge the words of one who is good for payment.  Therefore let your Excellency vouchsafe, adhering to the commands of our God, to give zealous attention to the assembling of a synod, that every corporal vice in priests, and simoniacal heresy, which was the first to arise in Churches from iniquitous ambition, may under threat of the censure of your power be removed by the definition of a council, and be cut off by the roots; lest, if gold is loved in your parts more than God, He who now remains tranquil while His precepts are despised be felt hereafter to be wrathful in vengeance.  And indeed, because we say all this for your own behoof, we therefore cease not to press you again and again, that we may be able, even by importunity, to do good to our most excellent and most sweet sons.  For it will be in all respects of advantage to your kingdom, if what is done in those parts against God be corrected by the emendation of your Excellency.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.vii.xxvi-p6"></a>Furthermore, what good service your Excellency did to our most reverend brother and fellow-bishop Augustine on his progress to the nation of the Angli we have learnt from the report of certain monks who returned to us from him.  Rendering you the greatest thanks for this, we beg you to bestow your benefits abundantly on the monks, the bearers of these <a name="page_73"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 73</font></a> <a name="ii.vii.xxvi-Page_73"></a>presents, whom we have sent to our said brother, to the end that, while under your patronage, they find no difficulties in your parts, but accomplish easily with the help of Christ the journey they have undertaken, you may reap your richer fruit of reward before the eyes of our God.</p>
