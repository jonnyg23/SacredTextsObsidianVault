 <p class="c23"><a name="iii.iv.xlviii-p2"></a>1. <i>Man.,</i> O, Death, be not thou boastful, over the just:  the sons of thy Lord who at His command, come to <i>dwell with thee</i>.—2. <i>R., To thee be glory that by Thy command, Death has reigned:  and by Thy Resurrection has been humbled to low estate!</i>—3. <i>Death.,</i> Herein am I exceeding great, according to thy saying:  that though I be bond-man I trample on them that are free.—4. <i>M</i>., Adam was chosen and ruler, and under his yoke:  thou, Death, and the Evil One, thy fellow, became bondmen.—5. <i>D</i>., This is our pride that lo! the slaves have become lords:  Death, and Satan, his fellow, have trampled on Adam.—6. <i>M</i>., Lo! the humbling of thee and thy fellow, accurst servants! how Enoch trampled on you both, <a name="page_219"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 219</font></a> <a name="iii.iv.xlviii-Page_219"></a>and rose aloft and reigned.—7. <i>D</i>., If so be Enoch made me grieve, yet have I comfort for on Noahs dust in Sheol, lo! I trample.—8. <i>M</i>., Tremble, O Death, before man, for though a servant, the yoke of his dominion reigns on all creatures.—9. <i>D</i>., I rejoice then that they are no mean <i>foes</i> that I have overcome:  for according to the greatness of the vanquished, he is great that overcomes.—10. <i>M</i>., Well does thy voice sing triumph, O Death, over the just:  for Enoch and Elijah have broken thy pair of wings.—11. <i>D</i>., I know <i>how</i> to weigh my sorrows with my comforts:  in place of two, lo! many are come and coming.—12. <i>M</i>., All that are come and coming to thee dwell as sojourners, and depart from thy abode as Lazarus.—13. <i>D</i>., This thy saying hurts me not, rather it heals me:  for Lazarus who rebelled against me, I again subdued.—14. <i>M</i>., Make answer, O Death, and argue what constrained him, to be raised unless it were a mystery, showing forth his resurrection.—15. <i>D</i>., Ye are famous in arguing as idle ones, while I labour in my task to discern and perform—16. <i>M</i>., Thou wast well prepared for argument, what has checked thee?  The truth of our resurrection has constrained thee by its reputations.—17. <i>D</i>., Ye have made me hated by you, though I be not hateful:  I am he that gives rest to your aged, and your afflicted.—18. Ye have made me as one that troubles, O ye mortals:  Adam brought death upon you, and I bear the blame.—19. Gently will I expose you, for I am a slave, and ye are they that by your sins have made me king.—20. The will of Adam roused me for I was at rest:  I was dead and ye quickened me, that ye might die by me.—21. I accuse the lying ones, who slew and denied it:  for Adam slew himself and charges me.—22. The beginning of strife was the accursed serpent which has rightly been crippled:  which crept, entered, and set enmity between me and you.—23. Satan is passed by and it is against me that ye are roused:  go, strive with the Evil One who made you transgress.—24. He is my comrade and I deny <i>it</i> not, but though he be much hated, what need that I be blamed for him.  I deny him henceforth.—25. Hearken to my words, O mortals, and I will console you:  I have afflicted you and I confess the life from the dead.—26. For there begins to steal into my ears a voice of preparation:  of the trumpet that holds itself ready to sound.—27. Hear my words and put much oil into your lamps:  for hindrance from my part there is none for you.—28. <i>Yet</i>, Know ye that even although I have said these things, dear is the sound of your voice in the solitude of Sheol.—29. For man has been weighed by me, and great is his peace:  for snakes and fishes and birds come to meet him.—30. But it is a marvel that to the Watchers, too, his converse is dear:  yea, the Evil One in Gehenna, desires his presence.—31. Ye shall have life from the dead, O ye mortals, and I who am bereft shall be bereft in the midst of Sheol.—32. Let praise ascend from all to Thee Who quickenest all, and from every quarter gatherest the dust of Adam!</p>
