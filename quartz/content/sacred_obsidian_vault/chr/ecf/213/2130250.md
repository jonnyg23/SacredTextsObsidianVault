 </p><p class="c16"><a name="iii.vi.iv-p1"></a> <a name="page_269"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 269</font></a> <a name="iii.vi.iv-Page_269"></a><span class="c50"><a name="iii.vi.iv-p1.1"></a>Hymn III.</span></p> 
 <p class="c23"><a name="iii.vi.iv-p2"></a>(<span class="sc"><a name="iii.vi.iv-p2.1"></a>Resp</span>.—<i>Christ with chrism, lo! He is sealing the newborn lambs in His flock!</i>)</p> 
 <p class="c23"><a name="iii.vi.iv-p3"></a>1.  Christ and chrism are conjoined; the secret with the visible is mingled:  the chrism anoints visibly,—Christ seals secretly, the lambs newborn and spiritual, the prize of His twofold victory; for He engendered it of the chrism, and He gave it birth of the water.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p4"></a>2.  How exalted are your Orders!  For she that was a sinner anointed, as a handmaid, the feet of her Lord.  <i>But</i> for you, as though <i>His</i> minister, Christ by the hand of His servants, seals and anoints your bodies.  It befits Him the Lord of the flock, that in His own person He seal His sheep.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p5"></a>3.  Since then she, that sinner, stood in need of forgiveness, the anointing was for her an offering, and by it her love reconciled her Lord.  But you who are the flock, among the profane and unbelievers, the Truth by the chrism is your seal, to separate you from the strayed.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p6"></a>4.  From the peoples he separated the People, by the former seal of circumcision; but by the seal of anointing, the peoples He separates from the People.  When the peoples were in error, the People He separated from the peoples; now when the People has erred from Him, He separates the peoples from thence.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p7"></a>5.  Of the dust of the pure soil, Naaman bore away and returned to his place; that he by this holy dust, might be separated and known from the unclean.  The chrism of Christ separates, the sons of the mystery from strangers:  and by it they that are within are separated, and known from them that are without.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p8"></a>6.  The oil which Elijah multiplied, might be tasted with the mouth; for the cruse was that of the widow, it was not that of the chrism.  The oil of our Lord that is in the cruse, it is not food for the mouth:  the sinner <i>that was</i> a wolf without, it makes him a lamb in the flock.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p9"></a>7.  The chrism of the meek and lowly One, changes the stubborn <i>to be</i> like its Lord.  The Gentiles were wolves and feared, the severe rod of Moses.  Lo! the chrism seals <i>them</i> and makes, a flock of sheep out of the wolves!  And the wolves that had fled from the rod, lo! they have taken refuge in the Cross!</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p10"></a>8.  The leaf of olive arrived, brought as a figure of the anointing; the sons of the Ark rejoiced to greet it, for it bore good tidings of deliverance.  Thus also ye rejoiced to greet it, even this holy anointing.  The bodies of sinners were glad in it, for it brought good tidings of deliverance.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p11"></a>9.  The oil again that Jacob poured, upon the stone when he sealed it, that it should be between him and God, and that he might offer there his tithes; lo! in it is a symbol of your bodies, <i>how</i> by chrism they are sealed <i>as</i> holy, and become temples for God, where He shall be served by your sacrifices.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p12"></a>10.  When Moses had sealed and anointed, the sons of Aaron the Levite, the fire consumed their bodies; the fire spared their vestments.  But ye my brethren blessed are ye, for the fire of grace has come down, has consumed utterly your offences, and cleansed and hallowed your bodies!</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p13"></a>11.  As for the anointing of Aaron my brethren, it was the vile blood of beasts, <i>that</i> it sprinkled in the horns of the altar.  The anointing of truth is this; wherein the living and all-lifegiving Blood, is sprinkled inwardly in your bodies, is mingled in your understandings, is infused through your inmost chambers.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p14"></a>12.  The anointed priests used to offer, the slain bodies of beasts; Ye, O anointed <a name="page_270"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 270</font></a> <a name="iii.vi.iv-Page_270"></a>and excelling, your offerings <i>are</i> your <i>own</i> bodies.  The anointed Levites offered, the inward parts <i>taken</i>, from beasts:  ye have excelled the Levites, for your hearts ye have Consecrated.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p15"></a>13.  The anointing of the People was—a foreshadowing of Christ; their rod a mystery of the Cross; their lamb a type of the Only begotten; their tabernacle a mystery of your Churches; their circumcision a sign of your sealing.  Under the shadow of your goodly thing, sat the People of old.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p16"></a>14.  Thus the truth is likened, to a great shadowing tree:  it cast its shade on the People; it struck its root among the peoples.  The People abode under its shadows, whose shadows were its mysteries; but the Gentiles lodged on its bough, and plucked and ate of its fruits.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p17"></a>15.  As <i>for</i> the anointing of Saul to be king; the sweeter was its savour, so much fouler was the savour of his heart.  The Spirit struck him and fled.  Your anointing which ye have is greater; for your minds are censers, in your temples the Spirit exults, a chamber forever shall ye be unto Him.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p18"></a>16.  As <i>for</i> the anointing of David my brethren; the Spirit came down and made sweet savour, in the heart of the man wherein He delighted; the savour of his heart <i>was</i> as the savour of his action.  The Spirit dwelt in him and made song in him.  Your anointing which ye have is greater, for Father and Son and Holy Ghost, have moved and come down to dwell in you.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p19"></a>17.  When the leper of old was cleansed, the priest used to seal him with oil, and to lead him to the waterspring.  The type has passed and the truth is come; lo! with chrism have ye been sealed, in baptism ye are perfected, in the flock ye are intermixed, from the Body ye are nourished.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p20"></a>18.  What leper when he has been cleansed, turns again and desires his leprosy?  Ye have put off transgressions—forsake it!  None puts on the leprosy he had put off.  It has fallen and sunk—let it not be drawn out!  It is wasted and worn—let it not be renewed!  Let not corruption come out upon you, whom the chrism of Christ has anointed!</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p21"></a>19.  The vessel moulded of clay, gains beauty from the water, receives strength from the fire; <i>but</i> if it slips it is ruined, it cannot be afresh renewed.  Ye are vessels of grace; be ye ware of it, even of justice, for it grants not two renewals.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p22"></a>20.  How like are ye in comparison, with the Prophet whom the fish yielded up!  The Devourer has given you back for he was constrained, by the Power Which constrained the fish.  Jonah was for you <i>as</i> a mirror, since not again did the fish swallow him, let not again the Devourer swallow you:  being yielded up be ye like Jonah!</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p23"></a>21.  Goodly ointment on the head of our Lord did Mary pour; its savour was fragrant through all the house.  Likewise the savour of your anointing, has been fragrant and perfumed the heavens, to the Watchers on high; doing pleasure to Satan its savour <i>is</i> overpowering; to God its odour <i>is</i> sweet.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p24"></a>22.  The crowds in the desert were like unto sheep that have no shepherd.  The Merciful became their shepherd, and multiplied to them the pasture of bread.  Yea, blessed <i>are</i> ye that are perfect, that are sealed <i>as</i> lambs of Christ, that of His Body and Blood are made worthy; the Pastor Himself is become pasture for you!</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p25"></a>23.  Out of water He made the wine, He gave <i>it</i> for drink to the youths in the feast.  For you who are keeping the fast, better is the unction than drink.  In His wine the betrothed are wedded, by His oil the wedded are sanctified.  By His wine <i>is</i> union; by His oil sanctification.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p26"></a>24.  The sheep of Christ leaped for joy, to receive the seal of life, that ensign of <a name="page_271"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 271</font></a> <a name="iii.vi.iv-Page_271"></a>kings which has ever put sin to flight.  The Wicked by Thy ensign is routed, iniquities by Thy sign are scattered.  Come, ye sheep, receive your seal, which puts to flight them that devour you!</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p27"></a>25.  Come, ye lambs, receive your seal, for it is truth that is your seal!  This is the seal that separates, them of the household from strangers.  The steel circumcised alike, the gainsayers and the sons of Hagar.  If circumcision <i>be</i> the sign of the sheep, lo! by it the goats are signed.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p28"></a>26.  But ye, <i>who are</i> the new flock, have put off the doings of wolves, and <i>as</i> lambs are made like to the Lamb.  One by changing has changed all; the Lamb to the wolves gave Himself to be slain; <i>the wolves</i> rushed and devoured Him and became lambs; for the Shepherd was changed into a Lamb; likewise the wolf forgot his nature.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p29"></a>27.  Look on me also in Thy mercy! be not branded on me the seal, of the goats the sons of the left hand! let not Thy sheep become a goat!  For though to justify myself I sufficed not, yet to be a sinner I willed not.  Turn <i>thine eyes</i>, O my Lord, from what I have done, and seek not only what I have willed.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p30"></a>28.  From them that write and them that preach, from them that hear and them that are sealed, let glory go up to Christ, and through Him to His Father <i>be</i> exaltation!  He Who gives words to them that speak, and gives voice to them that preach, has given understanding to them that hear, and consecrates chrism for him that is sealed.</p>
