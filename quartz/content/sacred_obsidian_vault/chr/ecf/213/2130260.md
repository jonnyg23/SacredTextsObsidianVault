 <p class="c23"><a name="iii.vi.xiv-p3"></a>(<span class="sc"><a name="iii.vi.xiv-p3.1"></a>Resp</span>.—<i>Brethren, sing praises, to the Son of the Lord of all; Who has bound for you crowns, such as kings long for!</i>)</p> 
 <p class="c23"><a name="iii.vi.xiv-p4"></a>1.  Your garments glisten, my brethren, as snow;—and fair is your shining in the likeness of Angels!</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.xiv-p5"></a>2.  In the likeness of Angels, ye have come up, beloved,—from Jordans river, in the armour of the Holy Ghost.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.xiv-p6"></a>3.  The bridal chamber that fails not, my brethren, ye have received:—and the glory of Adams house to-day ye have put on.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.xiv-p7"></a>4.  The judgment that <i>came</i> of the fruit, was Adams condemnation:—but for you victory, has arisen this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.xiv-p8"></a>5.  Your vesture is shining, and goodly your crowns:—which the Firstborn has bound for you, by the priests hand this day.</p>

 <p><a name="iii.vi.xiv-p10"></a>7.  The armour of victory, ye put on, my beloved:—in the hour when the priest, invoked the Holy Ghost.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.xiv-p11"></a>8.  The Angels rejoice, men here below exult:—in your feast, my brethren, wherein is no foulness.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.xiv-p12"></a>9.  The good things of Heaven, my brethren, ye have received:—beware of the Evil One, lest he despoil you.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.xiv-p13"></a>10.  The day when He dawned, the Heavenly King:—opens for you His door, and bids you enter Eden.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.xiv-p14"></a>11.  Crowns that fade not away, are set on your heads:—hymns of praise hourly, let your mouths sing.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.xiv-p15"></a>12.  Adam by means of the fruit, <i>God</i> cast forth in sorrow:—but you He makes glad, in the bride-chamber of joy.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.xiv-p16"></a>13.  Who would not rejoice, in your bridechamber, my brethren?—for the Father with His Son, and the Spirit rejoice in you.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.xiv-p17"></a>14.  Unto you shall the Father, be a wall of strength:—and the Son a Redeemer, and the Spirit a guard.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.xiv-p18"></a>15.  Martyrs by their blood, glorify their crowns:—but you our Redeemer, by His Blood glorifies.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.xiv-p19"></a>16.  Watchers and Angels, joy over the repentant:—they shall joy over you my brethren, that unto them ye are made like.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.xiv-p20"></a>17.  The fruit which Adam, tasted not in Paradise:—this day in your mouths, has been placed with joy.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.xiv-p21"></a>18.  Our Redeemer figured, His Body by the tree:—whereof Adam tasted not, because he had sinned.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.xiv-p22"></a>19.  The Evil One made war, and subdued Adams house:—through your baptism, my brethren, lo! he is subdued this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.xiv-p23"></a>20.  Great is the victory, but to-day you have won:—if so be ye neglect not, you shall not perish, my brethren.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.xiv-p24"></a>21.  Glory to them that are robed, glory to Adams house!—in the birth that <i>is</i> from the water, let them rejoice and be blessed!</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.xiv-p25"></a>22.  Praise to Him Who has robed, His Churches in glory!—glory to Him Who has magnified, the race of Adams house.</p>
