 <p class="c23"><a name="iii.iv.xi-p2"></a>1.  My children have been slain; and my daughters <i>that are</i> without me,—their walls are overthrown, their children scattered,—and their holy places trodden down.  <i>R., Blessed is Thy chastisement!</i></p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xi-p3"></a>2.  The fowlers have taken, my doves out of my strongholds,—which quitted their nests, and fled to the caves;—in the net have they taken them.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xi-p4"></a>3.  After the manner of wax, that melts before the fire,—thus melted and dissolved, the bodies, of my sons before the heat—and the drought of my strongholds.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xi-p5"></a>4.  And instead of streams, of milk that used to flow,—for my sons and my little ones, milk fails the sucklings, and water the weaned children.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xi-p6"></a>5.  The suckling falls, from its mother and gasps,—because it cannot suck, nor can she give suck:—they breathe out their spirit and die.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xi-p7"></a>6.  How is it possible, that Thy grace can refrain—the welling of its stream, when it is not possible to restrain—the abundance of its flow?</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xi-p8"></a>7.  And why has Thy grace, shut up its mercies,—and withheld its streams, from the people that cry,—for one to moisten their tongue?</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xi-p9"></a>8.  And there was a pit, between them and their brethren;—like the rich man who cried, and there was none to answer,—to moisten his tongue.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xi-p10"></a>9.  And as into the midst of fire, the wretched ones were cast;—and heat in the midst of thirst, the fire was blowing,—and kindling upon them.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xi-p11"></a>10.  Their carcases were melted, and dissolved by the heat;—they that had thirsted gave in turn the earth to drink,—of the reek of their bodies.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xi-p12"></a>11.  And the fort that with thirst, had killed, its dwellers,—it drank in its turn of the flux from the corpses,—that were melted by thirst.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xi-p13"></a>12.  Who has seen a people—that were burning with thirst,—while there surrounded them a wall of water and they could not—moisten their tongue!</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xi-p14"></a>13.  Surely with the judgment of Sodom, were my beloved judged,—and my children smitten, with the torment of Sodom;—though that was but <i>for</i> one day.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xi-p15"></a>14.  The torment of fire, though it be <i>for</i> one hour, O my Lord,—in lingering thirst, is a lingering death, and a subtle punishment.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xi-p16"></a>15.  After my sorrows, O my Lord, and my bitter sufferings,—this is the best comfort, wherewith Thou hast comforted me,—that Thou hast multiplied my afflictions.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xi-p17"></a>16.  The medicine that I hoped, it is sorrow decreed;—the binding up that I looked for, it is bitter calamity,—that it seeks to work for me.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xi-p18"></a>17.  And whereas I hoped to escape, from the midst of the storm;—worse for me is the storm in it, even in the harbour,—than that in the sea.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xi-p19"></a>18.  Whereas I thought in my folly, that I should anchor and escape—from the midst of the Gulf; my sins have cast me back—again into the midst of it.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xi-p20"></a>19.  Look, O my Lord, on my limbs, how the swords are thick in me,—and have left <i>their</i> mark on my arms; and the scars of the spears,—are planted in my sides!</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.xi-p21"></a>20.  Tears in mine eyes, and in my ears <i>ill</i> rumours,—wailing in my mouth, and mourning in my heart!—Add no more, O my Lord, to me!</p>
