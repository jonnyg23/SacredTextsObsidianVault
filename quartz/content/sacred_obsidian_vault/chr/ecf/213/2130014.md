 <p class="c22"><a name="ii.v.viii-p2"></a>To the Bishops of Sardinia.</p> 
 <p class="c23"><a name="ii.v.viii-p3"></a>Gregory to Vincentius, Innocentius, Marinianus, Libertinus, Agatho, and Victor, Bishops of Sardinia.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.v.viii-p4"></a>We have learnt that it is the custom of your island after the paschal festival, for you to go, or to send your representatives to your Metropolitan, and for him, whether you know the time or not, to give you directions by a written announcement concerning the following Easter.  And, as report goes, some of you, neglecting to do this according to custom, pervert the hearts of others also to disobedience.  It is added also that some of you, when seeking parts beyond sea in cases that arise touching their churches, venture to travel without the knowledge of their aforesaid metropolitan, or letters from him, such as canonical order prescribes.  <a name="page_5"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 5</font></a> <a name="ii.v.viii-Page_5"></a>We therefore exhort your Fraternity that, conforming to the custom of your churches, as well with respect to the announcement of Easter, as also if need should compel any of you to travel anywhere for business of your own, you should ask leave of your said metropolitan according to the rule imposed upon you; except that, if (as we hope will not be the case) you should happen to have a case against your said Metropolitan, then those who are in haste on this account to seek the judgment of the Apostolic See have licence to do so, as you know is allowed in the canons by the institution even of the ancient Fathers.</p>
