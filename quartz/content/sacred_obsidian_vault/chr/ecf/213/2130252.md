 </p><p class="c16"><a name="iii.vi.vi-p1"></a> <span class="c50"><a name="iii.vi.vi-p1.1"></a>Hymn V.</span></p> 
 <p class="c23"><a name="iii.vi.vi-p2"></a>(<span class="sc"><a name="iii.vi.vi-p2.1"></a>Resp</span>.—<i>Blessed be He that ordained baptism, for the atonement of the sons of Adam!</i>)</p> 
 <p class="c23"><a name="iii.vi.vi-p3"></a>1.  Descend, my brethren, put on from the waters of baptism the Holy Spirit;—be joined with the spirits that minister to the Godhead!</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.vi-p4"></a>2.  For lo! He is the fire that secretly, seals also His flock,—by the Three spiritual Names, wherein the Evil One is put to flight.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.vi-p5"></a>3.  John when he cried and said “This is the Lamb of God,”—thereby showed concerning the Gentiles that they are Abrahams children.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.vi-p6"></a>4.  This is he that testified of our Saviour, that with fire and the Spirit He should baptize.—Lo! the fire and the Spirit, my brethren, in the baptism of truth.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.vi-p7"></a>5.  For greater is Baptism than Jordan that little river;—for that in streams of water and oil, the misdeeds of all men are washed out.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.vi-p8"></a>6.  Elisha by seven times <i>washing</i>, cleansed Naamans leprosy:—in Baptism are cleansed the secret misdeeds in the soul.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.vi-p9"></a>7.  Moses baptized the People in the midst of the sea, yet availed not—to wash their heart within, that was full of the defilements of misdeeds.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.vi-p10"></a><a name="page_273"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 273</font></a> <a name="iii.vi.vi-Page_273"></a>8.  Lo! the priest in the likeness of Moses purges the defilements of the soul;—and with oil of anointing, lo! he seals new lambs for the Kingdom.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.vi-p11"></a>9.  Samuel anointed David to be king among the People:—but lo! the priest anoints you to be heirs in the Kingdom.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.vi-p12"></a>10.  For with the armour that David put on, after the anointing he fought—and laid low the giant who sought to subdue Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.vi-p13"></a>11.  Lo! again in the chrism of Christ, and in the armour that is from the water—the haughtiness of the Evil One is humbled, who sought to subdue the Gentiles.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.vi-p14"></a>12.  By the water that flowed from the rock, the thirst of the People was quenched.  Lo! in the fountain of Christ, the thirst of the peoples is quenched.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.vi-p15"></a>13.  The rod of Moses opened the rock, and the streams flowed forth; and they were refreshed by its draught, who had grown faint with thirst.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.vi-p16"></a>14.  Lo! from the side of Christ flowed the stream that bestowed life.—The Gentiles drank that were weary, and in it forgot their pains.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.vi-p17"></a>15.  With Thy dew besprinkle my vileness, and my crimes in Thy blood shall be atoned!—And I shall be, O my Lord, at Thy right hand, and with Thy Saints I shall be joined!</p>
