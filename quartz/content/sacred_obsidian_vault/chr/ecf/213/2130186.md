 <p class="c23"><a name="iii.iv.x-p2"></a>…My afflictions are as Jobs.  Thy justice delivered him; let Thy grace have mercy on me!</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.x-p3"></a>2.  In these two things is profit; that neither should the just, be weary in supplication, nor should the rebellious, multiply transgression.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.x-p4"></a>3.  With the sons Thou labourest, to chastise and help <i>them</i>; and that the fathers should not be grieved, by the sound of the scourge, they left me in peace.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.x-p5"></a>4.  Look, O my Lord, on my woods without, how they have been cut down! behold, O my Lord, my breasts within, that they are <i>too</i> weak, for me to bear my beloved ones!</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.x-p6"></a>5.  With swords they have cut off, my wings that are without; again the fire kindles, in my bosom within, the incense of burnt offering.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.x-p7"></a>6.  The sun-worshippers have killed, my sons in the plain:  and they that offer to Baal, have sacrificed my bulls in the city, my sheep with my babes.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.x-p8"></a>7.  In my fields is lamentation; in my halls wailing; in my vineyards terror; in my streets confusion.  Who can suffice for me?</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.x-p9"></a>8.  The Evil One who dealt treacherously, and disturbed me with his words, stirred up trouble within, so that my inward part, is wholly as my outward part.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.x-p10"></a>9.  With what face, O my Lord, shall I call on Thee to send, a camp of holy ones, to guard my bosom, which is full of uncleanness?</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.x-p11"></a>10.  With Thy new leaven, Thou hast chastened creation.  Make Thou the old leaven, which ensnares and humbles, to be like the new leaven!</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.x-p12"></a>11.  By the manifest striving, of Thy power let us conquer; lest error should crown, those that strive for Thee, cleaving <i>to them</i> with blandishment!</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.x-p13"></a>12.  If we look into our time, it is like our deceit; <a name="fr_349"></a><a href="#fn_349"><font size="1">350</font></a>
 —for in the years of truthfulness, we practised divinations,—and secretly used enchantments.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.x-p15"></a>13.  If I look into the time, it provokes and into light,—brings secret things, that our deceit may be shamed,—which wore the raiment of Truth.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.x-p16"></a>14.  Verily it is truth, that overcomes all; <a name="fr_350"></a><a href="#fn_350"><font size="1">351</font></a>
 —and the sea with its bitterness, cannot trouble it,—for it is pure in its nature.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.x-p18"></a>15.  In wisdom Thou hast made it, O my Lord, that it has laid bare our lust.—That the foolish should come to nought, and should not be encouraged,—<i>Truth</i> has withheld the crown.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.x-p19"></a>16.  On the tottering walls, whereon Thou hast given me victory,—the unthankful repay Thee, with sacrifice and libation, which provoke Thee openly.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.x-p20"></a>17.  If it were at that time, sacrifices had been offered;—there had been room even, for delusion to suppose,—that in these I was delivered.</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.x-p21"></a>18.  Through the multitude of deliverances, Thou hast rebuked two things:—the delusion of graven images, and the teaching of magicians;—for in Thee, O my Lord, have I been delivered!</p>
