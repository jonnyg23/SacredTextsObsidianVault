 <p class="c23"><a name="iii.iv.xlv-p2"></a>1. <i>Man</i>, O Death, despise thou it not, that image of Adam:  which like a seed is committed to earth, till the Resurrection.—2. <i>R., To thee be glory Who didst descend and plunge, after Adam:  and draw him out from the depths of Sheol, and bring him into Eden!</i>—3. <i>Death</i>, I marvel at this seed, and at your words:  for lo! after five thousand years, it springs not yet.—4. <i>M.</i>, Its present state passes away, as winter <i>does</i>:  and as a handful of <i>corn</i> it comes in the resurrection, to the garner of life.—5. <i>D</i>., That there is vintage-time, lo! I know, but I have not seen:  the dead at any time sown, or yet reaped.—6. <i>M</i>., There is coming a reaping, <a name="page_217"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 217</font></a> <a name="iii.iv.xlv-Page_217"></a>O Death, that will leave thee bare:  and the Watchers shall go forth as reapers, and make thee desolate.—7. <i>D</i>., When did I become husbandman, instead of vine-dresser? who has turned Sheol the wine-press, into a tilled field?—8. <i>M</i>., Does not the seed then teach thee, which decays and dies:  and <i>is</i> cut off from hope, yet from the rain, recovers hope?—9. <i>D</i>., A dream have ye seen ye feeble ones, of life from the dead:  for in waking time the resurrection, ye do not see.—10. <i>M</i>., Thy drowsiness hinders thee, that thou seest not:  the multitudes of mysteries which cry aloud, of the resurrection.—11. <i>D</i>., I know that seeds come to life, but I have not seen:  bones that grew in Sheol, and sprang and came up.—12. <i>M</i>., All thy discourse is like thyself, for lo! Ezekiel:  has taught thee how in the valley, the dead come to life.—13. <i>D</i>., Trees have I seen how in summer, they put on their garments:  but bones in their nakedness, are cast into Sheol.—14. <i>M</i>., Moses broke by his splendour, thy heart, O Death:  the son of Adam has regained and put on, the glory of Adam.—15. <i>D.</i>, Our law in Sheol is this, to keep silence:  for you are words and for me deeds, O feeble ones.—16. <i>M</i>., How are the aged passed over if thou be vinedresser?  He Who hindered thee from <i>taking</i> their lives, the same quickens all.—17. The babe in the womb confutes thee, which is <i>as</i> buried there:  to me it proclaims life from the dead, but to thee despoiling.—18. The despised flower despises thee, for it is shut up and passed over:  yet though lost it is not lost, but blossoms again.—19. The chick cries out from the egg, wherein it is buried:  and the graves are rent by a Voice, and the body arises.—20. For a body too is the chick, that is in the egg:  lo! its body to our body proclaims, the life from the dead.—21. With the locust thy plea is overthrown, and ended, O Death:  for in coming forth from the dust it teaches, the life from the dead.—22. <i>D.</i>, I had been content if already, the resurrection had been:  for the day of resurrection had disturbed me less, than your judgments.—23. Merciful is the Son of the Highest, yea good and just:  and will not harshly avenge on me, the death of Adam.—24. Have ye then no understanding, to perceive this:  that your father laid on you, this retribution?</p>
