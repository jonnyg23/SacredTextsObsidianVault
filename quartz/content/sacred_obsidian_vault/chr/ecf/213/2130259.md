 <p class="c23"><a name="iii.vi.xiii-p2"></a>(<span class="sc"><a name="iii.vi.xiii-p2.1"></a>Resp</span>.—<i>Blessed is He Who went down and was baptized in Jordan, and turned back the People from error!</i>)</p> 
 <p class="c23"><a name="iii.vi.xiii-p3"></a>1.  In Baptism Adam found <i>again</i>—that glory that <i>was</i> among the trees <i>of Eden</i>.—He went down, and received it out of the water;—he put it on, and went up and was adorned therein.—Blessed be He that has mercy on all!</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.xiii-p4"></a>2.  Man fell in the midst of Paradise,—and in baptism compassion restored him:—he lost his comeliness through <i>Satans</i> envy,—and found it <i>again</i> by <i>Gods</i> grace.—Blessed be He that has mercy on all!</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.xiii-p5"></a>3.  The wedded pair were adorned in Eden;—but the serpent stole their crowns:—yet mercy crushed down the accursed one,—and made the wedded pair goodly in their raiment.—Blessed be He that has mercy on all!</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.xiii-p6"></a>4.  They clothed themselves with leaves of necessity;—but the Merciful had pity on their beauty,—and instead of leaves of trees,—He clothed them with glory in the water.—Blessed be He that has mercy on all!</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.xiii-p7"></a>5.  Baptism is the well-spring of life,—which the Son of God opened by His Life;—and from His Side it has brought forth streams.—Come, all that thirst, come, rejoice!—Blessed be He that has mercy on all!</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.xiii-p8"></a>6.  The Father has sealed <i>Baptism</i>, to exalt it;—and the Son has espoused it to glorify it;—and the Spirit with threefold seal—has stamped it, and it has shone in holiness.—Blessed be He that has mercy on all!</p> 
 <p><a name="iii.vi.xiii-p9"></a>7.  The Trinity that is unsearchable—has laid up treasures in baptism.—Descend, ye poor, to its fountain!—and be enriched from it, ye needy!—Blessed be He that has mercy on all!</p>
