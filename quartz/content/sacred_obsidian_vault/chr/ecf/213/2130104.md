 </p><p class="c18"><a name="ii.vii.xxii-p1"></a> <span class="c1"><a name="ii.vii.xxii-p1.1"></a>Epistle LVI.</span></p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="ii.vii.xxii-p2"></a>To Ætherius, Bishop of Lugdunum (Lyons.)</p> 
 <p class="c23"><a name="ii.vii.xxii-p3"></a>Gregory to Ætherius, Bishop of Gaul.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.vii.xxii-p4"></a>The language of your epistles, full of venerable gravity, has so engaged our hearts affection that it would please us to be ever mingling mutual discourse, to the end that, if we cannot enjoy your bodily presence, absence may make no difference with us while this intercourse goes on between us.  For how great love of ecclesiastical order shines forth in you, and how great is your regard for discipline, and how great your earnestness in the observance of wholesome ordinances you shew in that you receive our exhortation submissively and altogether willingly, and declare that you will inviolably observe it.  Since then you bear a heart prompt for the amendment of others, and condemn with a free voice, as becomes you, an evil of old standing, and seeing that our other brethren and fellow-bishops also are similarly disposed, it is your duty to rise unanimously against the Lords enemies, and cast avarice out of the house of God by a synodical definition.  In the giving of ecclesiastical orders let not fierce hunger for gold find any satisfaction; let not flatteries filch any advantage; let not favour confer anything:  let a mans life have the reward of honour, his modesty promote his advancement; that, while this kind of ob<a name="page_71"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 71</font></a> <a name="ii.vii.xxii-Page_71"></a>servance obtains, both he that seeks to rise by bribes may be judged unworthy, and he to whom his conduct bears good testimony may be worthily honoured.  Let this be your care, most beloved brother, let this anxiety ever keep guard over your thoughts, so that you may prove by action that the zeal which you shew in your letters is the witness of your heart.  Wherefore continually and instantly press for the assembling of a synod; and so earnestly acquit yourself as to act up to the dignity of your title in the administration of your office.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.vii.xxii-p5"></a>With regard to what you request to have granted to your Church on the ground of ancient custom, we have caused search to be made in our archives, and nothing has been found.  Wherefore send to us the letters which you say you have, that from them we may gather what ought to be granted you.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.vii.xxii-p6"></a>As to the acts or writings of the blessed Irenæus, we have now long been searching for them, but have not succeeded so far in finding any of them.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.vii.xxii-p7"></a>Furthermore, let your Fraternity take care to hold as in all respects commended to you the monks whom we despatched to our brother and fellow-bishop Augustine, and for the sake of God display your charity towards them; and so earnestly concur with them in priestly zeal, and so hasten to help them with your succour for proceeding on their journey, that, while there shall be no cause of delay in your parts to detain them, both they may go on their way more speedily, and you may find a reward for what you have done in their behalf.  Given this 10th day of July, Indiction 4 <a name="fr_166"></a><a href="#fn_166"><font size="1">167</font></a>
