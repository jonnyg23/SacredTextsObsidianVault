 </p><p class="c18"><a name="ii.ix.xvi-p1"></a> <span class="c1"><a name="ii.ix.xvi-p1.1"></a>Epistle XXXIX.</span></p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="ii.ix.xvi-p2"></a>To Leontia, Empress.</p> 
 <p class="c23"><a name="ii.ix.xvi-p3"></a>Gregory to Leontia Augusta.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ix.xvi-p4"></a>What tongue may suffice to speak, what mind to think, what great thanks we owe to Almighty God for the serenity of your empire, in that such hard burdens of long duration have been removed from our necks, and the gentle yoke of imperial supremacy has returned, which subjects are glad to bear?  Glory, then, be given to the Creator of all by the hymning choirs of angels, thanksgiving be paid by men on earth, for that the whole republic, which has endured many wounds of sorrow, has now at length found the balm of your consolation.  Hence we must needs implore the more earnestly the mercy of Almighty God, that He would keep the heart of your Piety ever in His right hand, and dispose your thoughts by the aid of heavenly grace, to the end that your Tranquillity may be able to rule those who <a name="page_101"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 101</font></a> <a name="ii.ix.xvi-Page_101"></a>serve you the more righteously as you know more truly how to serve the Sovereign of all.  May He make you His champions in love of the catholic faith, having, of His benign dealing, made you our emperors.  May He infuse into your minds zeal together with gentleness, that you may always be able with pious fervour not to leave unavenged whatever is done amiss with regard to God, and in case of any delinquency against yourselves to bear and spare.  May He give us in your Piety the clemency of Pulcheria Augusta, who for her zeal for the catholic faith was called in the holy synod the new Helena (<i>Act.</i> 1 <i>synodi Chalcedonensis</i>).  May the Almighty mercy of God grant to you fuller length of days to live with our most pious lord, that the longer your life is extended, the more strongly may the consolation of your subjects be confirmed.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ix.xvi-p5"></a>I ought perhaps to have requested that your Tranquillity should hold as especially commended to you the Church of the blessed apostle Peter, which up to this time has laboured under grievous plots against it.  But, knowing that you love Almighty God, I ought not to ask what you will exhibit of your own accord out of the benignity of your piety.  For the more you fear the Creator of all, the more fully may you love the Church of him to whom it was said, <i>Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it; and to whom it is said, To thee I will give the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#018">Matth. xv. 18</a><a name="ii.ix.xvi-p5.1"></a>).  Whence it is not doubtful to us with what strong love you will bind yourself to him through whom you earnestly desire to be loosed from all sins.  May he, then, be the guardian of your empire, may he be your protector on earth, may he be an intercessor for you in heaven:  that through your relieving your subjects from hard burdens, and causing them to rejoice in your empire, you may, after many years, rejoice in the heavenly kingdom.</p>
