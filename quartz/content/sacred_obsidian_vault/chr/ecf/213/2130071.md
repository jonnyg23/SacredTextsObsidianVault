 <p class="c23"><a name="ii.vi.iv-p3"></a>Gregory to Anthemius, Subdeacon of Campania.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.vi.iv-p4"></a>After he who had been elected to the episcopate of the city of Surrentum had appeared to us to be unfit, they elected Amandus, presbyter of the oratory of Saint Severinus, which is in the Lucullan camp.  Wherefore we enjoin on thy Experience, laying aside excuses, to take care to send the said presbyter to us with all speed, to the end that, if there is nothing to hinder him from coming, the desires of the petitioners may with the help of Christ be fulfilled.  As to his life and deeds, seeing that they can be better known where he has long lived, let it be thy care, together with our brother and fellow-bishop, Fortunatus <a name="fr_106"></a><a href="#fn_106"><font size="1">107</font></a>
 , to make diligent enquiry.  And if there is nothing in the way of his promotion to the sacred order, he should be sent to us without any delay.  But, lest our glorious daughter Clementina should take this amiss, let thy Experience go to her, and do this thing with her consent.  If, however, she should be disposed to resist, let thy Experience still send him hither without delay, since we ought so to pacify the minds of our children as still not to obstruct benefit to souls.</p>
