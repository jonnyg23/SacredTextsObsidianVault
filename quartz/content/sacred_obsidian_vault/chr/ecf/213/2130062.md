 <p class="c22"><a name="ii.v.lvi-p2"></a>To Leander, Bishop of Hispalis (Seville).</p> 
 <p class="c23"><a name="ii.v.lvi-p3"></a>Gregory to Leander, Bishop of Spain.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.v.lvi-p4"></a>I have the epistle of thy Holiness, written with the pen of charity alone.  For what the tongue transferred to the paper had got its tincture from the heart.  Good and wise men were present when it was read, and at once their bowels were stirred with emotion.  Everyone began to seize thee in his heart with the hand of love, for that in that epistle the sweetness of thy disposition was not to be heard, but seen.  All severally were inflamed, and all admired, and the very fire of the hearers shewed what had been the ardour of the speaker.  For, unless torches burn themselves, they will not kindle others.  We saw, then, with how great charity thy mind was aflame, seeing that it so kindled others also.  Your life indeed, which I always remember with great reverence, they did not know; but the loftiness of your heart was manifest to them from the lowliness of your language.  As to my life, this your epistle speaks of it as worthy of imitation by all:  but may that which is not as it is said to be become so because it is said to be so, lest one should lie who is not wont to lie.  In reply to this, however, I speak shortly the words of a certain good woman, <i>Call me not Noemi, that is, fair; but call me Mara, for I am full of bitterness</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#020">Ruth i. 20</a><a name="ii.v.lvi-p4.1"></a>).  For indeed, good man, I am not to-day the man you knew.  For I confess that in advancing outwardly I have fallen much inwardly, and I fear that I am of the number of those of whom it is written, <i>Thou didst cast them down while they were lifted up</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#018">Psa. 73.18</a><a name="ii.v.lvi-p4.2"></a> <a name="fr_78"></a><a href="#fn_78"><font size="1">79</font></a>
 ).  For he is cast down when he is lifted up who advances in honours, and falls in manners.  For I, following the ways of my Head, had determined to be the scorn of men and the outcast of the people, and to run in the lot of him of whom again it is said by the Psalmist, <i>The ascents in his heart he hath disposed in the valley of tears</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#005">Ps. 74:5</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#006">6</a><a name="ii.v.lvi-p5.1"></a> <a name="fr_79"></a><a href="#fn_79"><font size="1">80</font></a>
 ); that is, that I should ascend inwardly all the more truly as I lay outwardly the more humbly in the valley of tears.  But now burdensome honour much depresses me, innumerable cares din me, and, when my mind collects itself for God, they cleave it with their assaults as if with a kind of swords.  My heart has no rest.  It lies prostrate in the lowest place, depressed by the weight of its cogitation.  Either very rarely or not at all does the wing of contemplation raise it aloft.  My sluggish soul is torpid, and, with temporal cares barking round it, already almost reduced to stupor, is forced now to deal with earthly things, and now even to dispense things that are carnal; nay sometimes, by force of disgust, is compelled to dispose of some things with accompanying guilt.  Why should I say more?  Overcome by its own weight, it sweats blood.  For, unless sin were reckoned under the name of blood, the Psalmist would not say, <i>Deliver me from blood guiltiness</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#014">Psa. 51.14</a><a name="ii.v.lvi-p6.1"></a> <a name="fr_80"></a><a href="#fn_80"><font size="1">81</font></a>
 ).  But, when we add sin to sins, we fulfil this also which is said by another prophet, <i>Blood hath touched blood</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#002">Hos. iv. 2</a><a name="ii.v.lvi-p7.1"></a>.)  For blood is said to touch blood when sin is joined to sin, so as to multiply the load of iniquity.  But in the midst of all this I implore thee by Almighty God to hold me who am fallen into the billows of perturbation with the hand of thy prayer.  For I sailed as it were with a prosperous breeze when I led a tranquil life in a monastery:  but a storm, rising suddenly with gusty surges, caught me in its commotion, and I lost the prosperity of my voyage; for in loss of rest I suffered shipwreck.  Lo, now I am tossed in the waves, and I seek for the plank of thy intercession, that, not being counted worthy to reach port rich with my ship entire, I may at least after losses be brought to shore by the aid of a plank.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.v.lvi-p8"></a>Your Holiness writes of being afflicted with the pains of gout, by continual suffering from which I too am grievously worn down.  But comfort will be readily at hand, if amid the scourges under which we suffer we recall to mind whatever faults we have committed; and then we shall see that they are not scourges, but gifts, if by pain of the flesh we purge the sins which we did for delight of the flesh.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.v.lvi-p9"></a>Furthermore we have sent you, with the blessing of the blessed Peter, Prince of the Apostles, a pallium, to be used only in celebration of Mass.  In sending it to you I ought to admonish you much as to how you ought to live:  but I suppress speech, since in your manner of life you anticipate my words.  May Almighty God keep you under His protection, and bring you to the rewards of the heavenly country with multiplied fruits of souls.  As to me, with what amount of business and with what weakness I am weighed down this short letter bears witness, in which I say little to one whom I greatly love.</p>
