 <p class="c22"><a name="ii.ix.xviii-p2"></a>To Eulogius, Patriarch of Alexandria.</p> 
 <p class="c23"><a name="ii.ix.xviii-p3"></a>Gregory to Eulogius, Bishop of Alexandria.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ix.xviii-p4"></a>A conversation having arisen one day between me and my familiar friends about the customs of churches, one who had studied the art of medicine in the great city of Alexandria told us that he had a fellow-student attending the same lectures, a boy of extreme depravity, who, he said, had been suddenly ordained a deacon.  And he added that he had procured ordination by bribes and gifts; for he acknowledged that this custom had prevailed in the holy Alexandrine Church.  On hearing this I was amazed, and exceedingly surprised that the tongue of the most holy and blessed man the lord Eulogius, which recalls so many heretics to the catholic faith, has not extirpated simoniacal heresy from the holy Alexandrine Church.  And who will there be whose exhortation or correction will be able to amend this, if his great and admirable teaching shall have left it without amendment?</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ix.xviii-p5"></a>Wherefore, for the absolution of your soul, for the increase of your reward, that your works may be in all respects perfect before the eyes of the tremendous Judge, you ought to make haste utterly to pull up and eradicate simoniacal <a name="page_102"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 102</font></a> <a name="ii.ix.xviii-Page_102"></a>heresy, which was the first to arise in the Church, from your most holy See, which is ours <a name="fr_226"></a><a href="#fn_226"><font size="1">227</font></a>
 .</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ix.xviii-p7"></a>For on this account it comes to pass that the holiness of ecclesiastical orders falls away from very many, because persons are promoted to these orders, not for their life and deeds, but for bribes.  But if meritorious character, and not bribes, be sought after, unworthy persons will not come to ordination.  And by so much the more will reward begin to accrue to you as any good men who have been promoted to sacred orders shall have devoted themselves to the care of winning souls.</p>
