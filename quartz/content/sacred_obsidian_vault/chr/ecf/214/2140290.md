 <p class="c35"><a name="x.xvi.viii-p5"></a>If one condemned by his bishop is received by Nestorius it shall profit him nothing.</p> 
 <p class="c18"><a name="x.xvi.viii-p6"></a>This canon is interesting as shewing that thus early in the history of the Church, it was not unusual for those disciplined for their faults in one communion to go to another and there be welcomed and restored, to the overthrow of discipline and to the lowering of the moral sense of the people to whom they minister.</p>
