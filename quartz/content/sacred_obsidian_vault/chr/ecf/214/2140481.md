 <p class="c35"><a name="xiv.iii.xcviii-p5"></a>Whoever in a temple has commerce with his wife and remains there out of contempt, shall be expelled even from the Catechumens.  If any one shall not observe this he shall be deposed or cut off.</p>

 <p class="c18"><a name="xiv.iii.xcviii-p7"></a>In the name of holy places, not the church itself but the adjoining and dependent buildings are intended such as those which are called the “Catechumena.”  For no one would be audacious enough to wish to cohabit with his wife in the very temple itself.</p>
