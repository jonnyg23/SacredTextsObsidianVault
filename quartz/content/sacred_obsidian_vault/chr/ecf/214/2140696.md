 </p><p class="c34"><a name="xvi.xiv.x-p1"></a> <span class="c4"><a name="xvi.xiv.x-p1.1"></a>Canon X.</span></p> 
 <p class="c35"><a name="xvi.xiv.x-p2"></a>That no cleric ought to leave his diocese and go into another without the knowledge of the Bishop.</p> 
 <p class="c18"><a name="xvi.xiv.x-p3"></a><span class="sc"><a name="xvi.xiv.x-p3.1"></a>Since</span> certain of the clergy, misinterpreting the canonical constitutions, leave their own diocese and run into other dioceses, especially into this God-protected royal city, and take up their abode with princes, celebrating liturgies in their oratories, it is not permitted to receive such persons into any house or church without the license of their own Bishop and also that of the Bishop of Constantinople.  And if any clerk shall do this without such license, and shall so continue, let him be deposed.  With regard to those who have done this with the knowledge of the aforesaid Bishops, it is not lawful for them to undertake mundane and secular responsibilities, since this is forbidden by the sacred canons.  And if anyone is discovered holding the office of those who are called Meizoteroi; let him either lay it down, or be deposed from the priesthood.  Let him rather be the instructor of the children and others of the household, reading to them the Divine Scriptures, for to this end he received the priesthood.</p>

 <p class="c35"><a name="xvi.xiv.x-p6"></a>A clergyman who after leaving his own parish has settled in another far off from his own bishop and from the bishop of Constantinople, shall be received neither into house nor church.  And if he shall persevere in his course, he shall be deposed.  But if they shall do this with a knowledge of what we have said, they shall not receive a secular position; or should they have received them, they shall cease from them.  And if they refuse they shall be deposed.</p>

 <p class="c18"><a name="xvi.xiv.x-p8"></a>On the office of the <span class="Greek"><a name="xvi.xiv.x-p8.1"></a>μειζότεροι</span> , the Greek commentators Zonaras and Balsamon give us more exact information.  We give the substance of it, viz.:  they were <i>majores domus</i> stewards of the estates of high personages.</p> 
 <p class="c36"><a name="xvi.xiv.x-p9"></a><span class="sc"><a name="xvi.xiv.x-p9.1"></a>Balsamon</span>.</p> 
 <p class="c18"><a name="xvi.xiv.x-p10"></a>On account of this canon it seems to me that the most holy Patriarch at the time and his Chartophylax allow alien clergymen to celebrate the liturgy in this royal city, even without letters dimissory of the local bishop of each one.</p>
