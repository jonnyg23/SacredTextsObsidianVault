 <p class="c18"><a name="viii.vii.iii.li-p7"></a>It is doubtful whether by the Thursday of the text was meant only the Thursday of Holy Week, or every Thursday of the time during which the catechumens received instruction.  The Greek commentators are in favour of the latter, but Dionysius Exiguus and Isidore, and after them Bingham, are, and probably rightly, in favour of the former meaning.  This canon was repeated by the Trullan Synod in its seventy-eighth canon.</p>
