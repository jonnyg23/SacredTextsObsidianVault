 <p class="c18"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xii-p7"></a>This canon does not speak generally of all those who sacrificed before baptism; for if a heathen sacrificed before having embraced Christianity, he certainly could not be reproached for it after his admission.  It was quite a different case with a catechumen, who had already declared for Christianity, but who, during the persecution had lost courage, and sacrificed.  In this case it might be asked whether he could still be admitted to the priesthood.  The Council decided that a baptized catechumen could afterwards be promoted to holy orders.</p>
