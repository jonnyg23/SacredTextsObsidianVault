 <p class="c18"><a name="xiv.iii.lxiv-p6"></a>What is condemned is false histories of true martyrs, not (as Johnson erroneously supposes) “false legends of pretended martyrs.”  There have been martyrs, both royal and plebeian, in much later times whose lives have been made ridiculous and whose memory has been rendered hateful to the ignorant people by so-called “histories” which might well have received the treatment ordered by the canon.</p>
