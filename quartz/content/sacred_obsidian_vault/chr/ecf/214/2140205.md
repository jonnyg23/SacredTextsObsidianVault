 <p class="c18"><a name="viii.vii.iii.xxxix-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="viii.vii.iii.xxxix-p2.1"></a>No</span> Christian shall forsake the martyrs of Christ, and turn to false martyrs, that is, to those of the heretics, or those who formerly were heretics; for they are aliens from God.  Let those, therefore, who go after them, be anathema.</p>

 <p class="c35"><a name="viii.vii.iii.xxxix-p5"></a>Whoso honours an heretical pseudo-martyr let him be anathema.</p>

 <p class="c18"><a name="viii.vii.iii.xxxix-p7"></a>This canon forbids the honouring of martyrs not belonging to the orthodox church.  The number of Montanist martyrs of Phrygia was probably the occasion of this canon.</p> 
 <p class="c18"><a name="viii.vii.iii.xxxix-p8"></a>The phrase which I have translated “to those who formerly were heretics” has caused great difficulty to all translators and scarcely two agree.  Hammond reads “those who have been reputed to have been heretics;” and with him Fulton agrees, but wrongly (as I think) by omitting the “to.”  Lambert translates “to those who before were heretics” and correctly.  With him agrees Van Espen, thus, <i>vel eos qui prius heretici fuere</i>.</p>
