 <p class="c18"><a name="x.ix.viii-p10"></a>When the blessed Gabriel announced to the holy Virgin the generation of the only-begotten Son of God according to the flesh, he said, “Thou shalt bear a son; and thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins.”  But he was named also Christ, because that according to his human nature he was anointed with us, according to the words of the Psalmist:  “Thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity:  therefore God, even thy God hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.”  For although he was the giver of the Holy Spirit, neither did he give it by measure to them that were worthy (for he was full of the Holy Ghost, and of his fulness have we all received, as it is written), nevertheless as he is man he was called anointed economically, the Holy Spirit resting upon him spiritually (<span class="Greek"><a name="x.ix.viii-p10.1"></a>νοητῶς</span>) and not after the manner of men, in order that he might abide in us, although he had been driven forth from us in the beginning by Adams fall.  He therefore the only begotten Word of God made flesh was called Christ.  And since he possessed as his own the power proper to God, he wrought his wonders.  Whosoever therefore shall say that the glory of the Only-begotten was added to the power of Christ, as though the Only-begotten was different from Christ, they are thinking of two sons; the one truly working and the other impelled (by the strength of another, <i>Lat</i>.) as a man like to us; and all such fall under the penalty of this anathematism.</p>
