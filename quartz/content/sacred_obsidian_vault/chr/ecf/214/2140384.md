 <p class="c31"><a name="xiv.iii.i-p2"></a>(Labbe and Cossart, <i>Concilia</i>, Tom. VI., col. 1135 <i>et seqq</i>.)</p> 
 <p class="c34"><a name="xiv.iii.i-p3"></a><span class="c4"><a name="xiv.iii.i-p3.1"></a>Canon I.</span></p> 
 <p class="c18"><a name="xiv.iii.i-p4"></a><span class="sc"><a name="xiv.iii.i-p4.1"></a>That</span> order is best of all which makes every word and act begin and end in God.  Wherefore that piety may be clearly set forth by us and that the Church of which Christ is the foundation may be continually increased and advanced, and that it may be exalted above the cedars of Lebanon; now therefore we, by divine grace at the beginning of our decrees, define that the faith set forth by the God-chosen Apostles who themselves had both seen and were ministers of the Word, shall be preserved without any innovation, unchanged and inviolate.</p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="xiv.iii.i-p5"></a>Moreover the faith of the three hundred and eighteen holy and blessed fathers who were assembled at Nice under Constantine our Emperor, against the impious Arius, and the gentile diversity of deity or rather (to speak accurately) multitude of gods taught by him, who by the unanimous acknowledgment of the faithful revealed and declared to us the consubstantiality of the Three Persons comprehended in the Divine Nature, not suffering this faith to lie hidden under the bushel of ignorance, but openly teaching the faithful to adore with one worship the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, confuting and scattering to the winds the opinion of different grades, and demolishing and overturning the puerile toyings fabricated out of sand by the heretics against orthodoxy.</p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="xiv.iii.i-p6"></a>Likewise also we confirm that faith which was set forth by the one hundred and fifty fathers who in the time of Theodosius the Elder, our Emperor, assembled in this imperial city, accepting their decisions with regard to the Holy Ghost in assertion of his godhead, and expelling the profane Macedonius (together with all previous enemies of the truth) as one who dared to judge Him to be a servant who is Lord, and who wished to divide, like a robber, the inseparable unity, so that there might be no perfect mystery of our faith.</p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="xiv.iii.i-p7"></a>And together with this odious and detestable contender against the truth, we condemn Apollinaris, priest of the same iniquity, who impiously belched forth that the Lord assumed a body unendowed with a soul, <a name="fr_341"></a><a href="#fn_341"><font size="1">342</font></a>
  thence also inferring that his salvation wrought for us was imperfect.</p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="xiv.iii.i-p9"></a>Moreover what things were set forth by the two hundred God-bearing fathers in the city of Ephesus in the days of Theodosius our Emperor, the son of Arcadius; these doctrines we assent to as the unbroken strength of piety, teaching that Christ the incarnate Son of God is one; and declaring that she who bare him without human seed was the immaculate Ever-Virgin, glorifying her as literally and in very truth the Mother of God.  We condemn as foreign to the divine scheme the absurd division of Nestorius, who teaches that the one Christ consists of a man separately and of the Godhead separately and renews the Jewish impiety.</p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="xiv.iii.i-p10"></a>Moreover we confirm that faith which at Chalcedon, the Metropolis, was set forth in accordance with orthodoxy by the six hundred and thirty God-approved fathers in the time of Marcian, who was our Emperor, which handed down with a great and mighty voice, even unto the ends of the earth, that the one Christ, the son of God, is of two natures, and must be glorified <a name="fr_342"></a><a href="#fn_342"><font size="1">343</font></a>
  in these two natures, and which cast forth from the sacred precincts of the Church as a black pestilence to be avoided, Eutyches, babbling stupidly and inanely, and teaching that the great mystery of the incarnation (<span class="Greek"><a name="xiv.iii.i-p11.1"></a>οἰκονωμίας</span>) was perfected in thought only.  And together with him also Nestorius and Dioscorus of whom the former was the defender and champion of the division, the latter of the confusion [of the two natures in the one Christ], both of whom fell away from the divergence of their impiety to a common depth of perdition and denial of God.</p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="xiv.iii.i-p12"></a><a name="page_360"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 360</font></a> <a name="xiv.iii.i-Page_360"></a>Also we recognize as inspired by the Spirit the pious voices of the one hundred and sixty-five God-bearing fathers who assembled in this imperial city in the time of our Emperor Justinian of blessed memory, and we teach them to those who come after us; for these synodically anathematized and execrated Theodore of Mopsuestia (the teacher of Nestorius), and Origen, and Didymus, and Evagrius, all of whom reintroduced feigned Greek myths, and brought back again the circlings of certain bodies and souls, and deranged turnings [or transmigrations] to the wanderings or dreamings of their minds, and impiously insulting the resurrection of the dead.  Moreover [they condemned] what things were written by Theodoret against the right faith and against the Twelve Chapters of blessed Cyril, and that letter which is said to have been written by Ibas.</p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="xiv.iii.i-p13"></a>Also we agree to guard untouched the faith of the Sixth Holy Synod, which first assembled in this imperial city in the time of Constantine, our Emperor, of blessed memory, which faith received still greater confirmation from the fact that the pious Emperor ratified with his own signet that which was written for the security of future generations.  This council taught that we should openly profess our faith that in the incarnation of Jesus Christ, our true God, there are two natural wills or volitions and two natural operations; and condemned by a just sentence those who adulterated the true doctrine and taught the people that in the one Lord Jesus Christ there is but one will and one operation; to wit, Theodore of Pharan, Cyrus of Alexandria, Honorius of Rome, Sergius, Pyrrhus, Paul and Peter, who were bishops of this God-preserved city; Macarius, who was bishop of Antioch; Stephen, who was his disciple, and the insane Polychronius, depriving them henceforth from the communion of the body of Christ our God.</p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="xiv.iii.i-p14"></a>And, to say so once for all, we decree that the faith shall stand firm and remain unsullied until the end of the world as well as the writings divinely handed down and the teachings of all those who have beautified and adorned the Church of God and were lights in the world, having embraced the word of life.  And we reject and anathematize those whom they rejected and anathematized, as being enemies of the truth, and as insane ragers against God, and as lifters up of iniquity.</p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="xiv.iii.i-p15"></a>But if any one at all shall not observe and embrace the aforesaid pious decrees, and teach and preach in accordance therewith, but shall attempt to set himself in opposition thereto, let him be anathema, according to the decree already promulgated by the approved holy and blessed Fathers, and let him be cast out and stricken off as an alien from the number of Christians.  For our decrees add nothing to the things previously defined, nor do they take anything away, nor have we any such power.</p>

 <p class="c36"><a name="xiv.iii.i-p17"></a><span class="sc"><a name="xiv.iii.i-p17.1"></a>Ancient Epitome of Canon I.</span></p> 
 <p class="c35"><a name="xiv.iii.i-p18"></a>No innovation upon the faith of the Apostles is to be allowed.  The faith of the Nicene fathers is perfect, which overthrows through the homousion the doctrines of Arius who introduced degrees into the Godhead.</p> 
 <p class="c39"><a name="xiv.iii.i-p19"></a>The Synod held under Theodosius the great shall be held inviolate, which deposed Macedonius who asserted that the Holy Ghost was a servant.</p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="xiv.iii.i-p20"></a><i>The two hundred who under Theodosius the Younger assembled at Ephesus are to be revered for they expelled Nestorius who asserted that the Lord was man and God separately</i> (<span class="Greek"><a name="xiv.iii.i-p20.1"></a>ἰδικῶς</span>).</p> 
 <p class="c39"><a name="xiv.iii.i-p21"></a>Those who assembled at Chalcedon in the time of Marcion are to be celebrated with eternal remembrance, who deposed Eutyches, who dared to say that the great mystery was accomplished only in image, as well as Nestorius and Dioscorus, observing equal things in an opposite direction.</p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="xiv.iii.i-p22"></a><i>One hundred and sixty-five were assembled in the imperial city by Justinian, who anathematized Origen, for teaching periods</i> (<span class="Greek"><a name="xiv.iii.i-p22.1"></a>περιόδους</span> ) <i>of bodies and souls, and Theodoret who dared to set himself up to oppose the Twelve Chapters of Cyril.</i></p> 
 <p class="c39"><a name="xiv.iii.i-p23"></a>At Constantinople a Synod was collected under Constantine which rejected Honorius of Rome and Sergius, prelate of Constantinople, for teaching one will and one operation.</p>

 <p class="c18"><a name="xiv.iii.i-p25"></a>The fifth was held in the time of Justinian the Great at Constantinople against the crazy (<span class="Greek"><a name="xiv.iii.i-p25.1"></a>παράφρονς</span>) Origen, Evagrius and Didymus, who remodelled the Greek figments, and stupidly said that the same bodies they had joined with them would not rise again; and that Paradise was not subject to the appreciation of the sense, and that it was not from God, and that Adam was not formed in flesh, and that there would be an end of punishment, and a restitution of the devils to their pristine state, and other innumerable insane blasphemies.</p>
