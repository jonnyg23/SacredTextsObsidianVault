 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iii.v.xxvi-p1"></a>Of another old man, who never partook of food alone in his cell.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.v.xxvi-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.v.xxvi-p2.1"></a>We</span> have seen another who lived alone, who declared that he had never enjoyed food by himself alone, but that even if for five days running none of the brethren came to his cell he constantly put off taking food until on Saturday or Sunday he went to church for service and found some stranger whom he brought home at once to his cell, and together with him partook of refreshment for the body not so much by reason of his own needs, as for the sake of kindness and on his brothers account. And so as they know that the daily fast is broken without scruple on the arrival of brethren, when they leave, they compensate for the refreshment which has been enjoyed on their account by a greater abstinence, and sternly make up for the reception of even a very little food by a severer chastisement not only as regards bread, but also by lessening their usual amount of sleep.</p>
