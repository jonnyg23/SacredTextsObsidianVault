 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iv.iii.vi-p1"></a>Of the destruction of two brethren for lack of discretion.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iv.iii.vi-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iv.iii.vi-p2.1"></a>What</span> shall I say of those two brethren who lived beyond that desert of the Thebaid where once the blessed Antony dwelt, and, not being sufficiently influenced by careful discrimination, when they were going through the vast and extended waste determined not to take any food with them, except such as the Lord Himself might provide for them. And when as they wandered through the deserts and were already fainting from hunger they were spied at a distance by the Mazices <a name="fr_1178"></a><a href="#fn_1178"><font size="1">1179</font></a>
  (a race which is even more savage and ferocious than almost all wild tribes, for they are not driven to shed blood, as other tribes are, from desire of spoil but from simple ferocity of mind), and when these acting contrary to their natural ferocity, met them with bread, one of the two as discretion came to his aid, received it with delight and thankfulness as if it were offered to him by the Lord, thinking that the food  <a name="page_311"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 311</font></a> <a name="iv.iv.iii.vi-Page_311"></a>had been divinely provided for him, and that it was Gods doing that those who always delighted in bloodshed had offered the staff of life to men who were already fainting and dying; but the other refused the food because it was offered to him by men and died of starvation. And though this sprang in the first instance from a persuasion that was blame-worthy yet one of them by the help of discretion got the better of the idea which he had rashly and carelessly conceived, but the other persisting in his obstinate folly, and being utterly lacking in discretion, brought upon himself that death which the Lord would have averted, as he would not believe that it was owing to a Divine impulse that the fierce barbarians forgot their natural ferocity and offered them bread instead of a sword.</p>
