 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iii.viii.viii-p1"></a>Instances from the life of the blessed David in which anger was rightly felt.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.viii.viii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.viii.viii-p2.1"></a>And</span> at any rate (this is the case), when we are agitated against this very anger, because it has stolen on us against our brother, and when in wrath we expel its deadly incitements, nor suffer it to have a dangerous lurking place in the recesses of our heart. To be angry in this fashion even that prophet teaches us who had so completely expelled it from his own feelings that he would not retaliate even on his enemies and those delivered by God into his hands: when he says “Be ye angry and sin not.” <a name="fr_929"></a><a href="#fn_929"><font size="1">930</font></a>
  For he, when he had longed for water from the well of Bethlehem, and had been given it by his mighty men, who had brought it through the midst of the hosts of the enemy, at once poured it out on the ground: and thus in his anger extinguished the delicious feeling of his desire, and poured it out to the Lord, without satisfying the longing that he had expressed, saying: “That be  <a name="page_260"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 260</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.viii.viii-Page_260"></a>far from me that I should do this! Shall I drink the blood of those men who went forth on the danger of their souls?” <a name="fr_930"></a><a href="#fn_930"><font size="1">931</font></a>
  And when Shimei threw stones at King David and cursed him, in his hearing, before everybody, and Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, the captain of the host, wished to cut off his head and avenge the insult to the king, the blessed David moved with pious wrath against this dreadful suggestion of his, and keeping the due measure of humility and a strict patience, said with imperturbable gentleness, “What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? Let him alone that he may curse. For the Lord hath commanded him to curse David. And who is he who shall dare to say, Why hast thou done this? Behold my son, who came forth from my loins, seeks my life, and how much more this son of Benjamin? Let him alone, that he may curse, according to the command of the Lord. It may be the Lord will look upon my affliction, and return to me good for this cursing to-day.” <a name="fr_931"></a><a href="#fn_931"><font size="1">932</font></a>
