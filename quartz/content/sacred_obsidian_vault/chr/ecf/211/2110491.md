 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iii.x.vi-p1"></a>How injurious are the effects of accidie.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.x.vi-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.x.vi-p2.1"></a>And</span> whenever it begins in any degree to overcome any one, it either makes him stay in his cell idle and lazy, without making any spiritual progress, or it drives him out from thence and makes him restless and a wanderer, and indolent in the matter of all kinds of work, and it makes him continually go round, the cells of the brethren and the monasteries, with an eye to nothing but this; viz., where or with what excuse he can presently procure some refreshment. For the mind of an idler cannot think of anything but food and the belly, until the society of some man or woman, equally cold and indifferent, is secured, and it loses itself in their affairs and business, and is thus little by little ensnared by dangerous occupations, so that, just as if it were bound up in the coils of a serpent, it can never disentangle itself again and return to the perfection of its former profession.</p>
