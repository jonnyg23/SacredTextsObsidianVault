 <p> <a name="iv.vii.viii.xxvi"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iv.vii.viii.xxvi-p0.1"></a>Chapter XXVI.</h4>  
 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.vii.viii.xxvi-p1"></a>He adds to the foregoing the testimony of S. Jerome.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.vii.viii.xxvi-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.vii.viii.xxvi-p2.1"></a>Jerome</span>, the Teacher of the Catholics, whose writings shine like divine lamps throughout the whole world, says in his book to Eustochium: “The Son of God for our salvation was made the Son of man. He waits ten months in the womb to be born: and He, in whose hand the world is held, is contained in a narrow manger.” <a name="fr_2668"></a><a href="#fn_2668"><font size="1">2669</font></a>
  Again in his commentary on Isaiah: “For the Lord of hosts, who is the King of glory, Himself descended into the Virgins womb, and entered in and went forth from the East Gate which is ever shut.” <a name="fr_2669"></a><a href="#fn_2669"><font size="1">2670</font></a>
  Of whom Gabriel says to the Virgin: “The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee. Wherefore that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.” And in Proverbs: “Wisdom hath builded herself an house.” <a name="fr_2670"></a><a href="#fn_2670"><font size="1">2671</font></a>
  Compare this if you please with your doctrine or rather your blasphemy, in which you assert that God is the Creator of the months, and was not an offspring of months. For lo, Jerome, a man of the greatest knowledge and also of the most pure and approved doctrine testifies almost in the very words in which you deny that the Son of God was an offspring of months, that He was an offspring of months. For he says that He waits ten months in the womb to be born. But perhaps the authority of this man seems a mere nothing to you. You may take it that every one says the same and in the same words, for whoever does not deny that the Son of God is the offspring of the Virgin, admits that He is the offspring of months.</p>
