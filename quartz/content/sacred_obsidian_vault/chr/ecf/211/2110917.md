 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.v.vii.xxvi-p1"></a>The answer that the weak does not always allow himself to be borne.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.v.vii.xxvi-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.v.vii.xxvi-p2.1"></a>Joseph</span>: I did not say that the virtue and endurance of one who is strong and robust would be overcome, but that the miserable condition of the weak, encouraged by the tolerance of the perfect, and daily growing worse, is sure to give rise to reasons on account of which he himself ought no longer to be borne; or else with a shrewd suspicion that the patience of his neighbour shows up and sets off his own impatience at some time or other he chooses to make off rather than always to be borne by the magnanimity of the other. This then we think should be above all else observed by those who want to keep the affec<a name="page_459"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 459</font></a> <a name="iv.v.vii.xxvi-Page_459"></a>tion of their companions unimpaired; viz., that first of all when provoked by any wrongs, a monk should keep not only his lips but even the depth of his breast unmoved: but if he finds that they are even slightly disturbed, let him keep himself in by entire silence, and diligently observe what the Psalmist speaks of: “I was troubled and spake nothing;” and: “I said I will take heed to thy ways that I offend not with my tongue. I have set a guard to my mouth, when the sinner stood against me. I was dumb and was humbled, and kept silence from good things;” <a name="fr_2002"></a><a href="#fn_2002"><font size="1">2003</font></a>
  and he should not pay any heed to his present state, nor give vent to what his violent rage suggests and his exasperated mind expresses at the moment, but should dwell on the grace of past love or look forward in his mind to the renewal and restoration of peace, and contemplate it even in the very hour of rage, as if it were sure presently to return. And while he is reserving himself for the delight of harmony soon to come, he will not feel the bitterness of the present quarrel and will easily make such answers that, when love is restored, he will not be able to accuse himself as guilty or be blamed by the other; and thus he will fulfil these words of the prophet: “In wrath remember mercy.” <a name="fr_2003"></a><a href="#fn_2003"><font size="1">2004</font></a>
