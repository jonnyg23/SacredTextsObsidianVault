 <p> <a name="iv.iv.ix.vii"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iv.iv.ix.vii-p0.1"></a>Chapter VII.</h4>  
 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iv.ix.vii-p1"></a>Of the origin of principalities or powers.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iv.ix.vii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iv.ix.vii-p2.1"></a>None</span> of the faithful question the fact that before the formation of this visible creation God made spiritual and celestial powers, in order that owing to the very fact that they knew that they had been formed out of nothing by the goodness of the Creator for such glory and bliss, they might render to Him continual thanks and ceaselessly continue to praise Him. For neither should we imagine that God for the first time began to originate His creation and work with the formation of this world, as if in those countless ages beforehand He had taken no thought of Providence and the divine ordering of things, and as if we could believe that having none towards whom to show the blessings of His goodness, He had been solitary, and a stranger to all bountifulness; a thing which is too poor and unsuitable to fancy of that boundless and eternal and incomprehensible Majesty; as the Lord Himself says of these powers: “When the stars were made together, all my angels praised Me with a loud voice.” <a name="fr_1526"></a><a href="#fn_1526"><font size="1">1527</font></a>
  Those then who were present at the creation of the stars, are most clearly proved to have been created before that “beginning” in which it is said that heaven and earth were made, inasmuch as they are said with loud voices and admiration to have praised the Creator because of all those visible creatures which, as they saw,  <a name="page_378"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 378</font></a> <a name="iv.iv.ix.vii-Page_378"></a>proceeded forth from nothing. Before then that beginning in time which is spoken of by Moses, and which according to the historic and Jewish interpretation denotes the age of this world (without prejudice to <i>our</i> interpretation, according to which we explain that the “beginning,” of all things is Christ, in whom the Father created all things, as it is said “All things were made by him, and without Him was not anything made,”) <a name="fr_1527"></a><a href="#fn_1527"><font size="1">1528</font></a>
  before, I say, that beginning of Genesis in time there is no question that God had already created all those powers and heavenly virtues; which the Apostle enumerates in order and thus describes: “For in Christ were created all things both in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether they be angels or archangels, whether they be thrones or dominions, whether they be principalities or powers. All things were made by Him and in Him.” <a name="fr_1528"></a><a href="#fn_1528"><font size="1">1529</font></a>
