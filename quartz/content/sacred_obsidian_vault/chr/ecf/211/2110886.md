 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.v.vi.vi-p1"></a>How the merits of each man should not be judged by his miracles.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.v.vi.vi-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.v.vi.vi-p2.1"></a>And</span> so these men gave no credit to themselves for their power of working such wonders, because they confessed that they were done not by their own merits but by the compassion of the Lord and with the words of the Apostle they refused the human hon<a name="page_448"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 448</font></a> <a name="iv.v.vi.vi-Page_448"></a>our offered out of admiration for their miracles: “Men and brethren, why marvel ye at this, or why look ye on us as though by our own power or holiness we had caused this man to walk.” <a name="fr_1950"></a><a href="#fn_1950"><font size="1">1951</font></a>
  Nor did they think that any one should be renowned for the gifts and marvels of God, but rather for the fruits of his own good deeds, which are brought about by the efforts of his mind and the power of his works. For often, as was said above, men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the truth, both cast out devils and perform the greatest miracles in the name of the Lord. Of whom when the Apostles complained and said: “Master, we saw one casting out devils in Thy name, and we forbade him because he followeth not with us,” though for the present Christ replied to them “Forbid him not, for he that is not against you is for you,” <a name="fr_1951"></a><a href="#fn_1951"><font size="1">1952</font></a>
  still when they say at the end: “Lord, Lord, have we not in Thy name prophesied, and in Thy name cast out devils, and in Thy name done many mighty works?” He testifies that then He will answer: “I never knew you: depart from me, ye workers of iniquity.” <a name="fr_1952"></a><a href="#fn_1952"><font size="1">1953</font></a>
  And therefore He actually warns those, to whom He Himself has given this glory of miracles and mighty works because of their holiness, that they be not puffed up by them, saying: “Rejoice not because the devils are subject to you, but rejoice rather because your names are written in heaven.” <a name="fr_1953"></a><a href="#fn_1953"><font size="1">1954</font></a>
