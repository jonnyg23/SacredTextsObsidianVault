 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iii.v.xxxv-p1"></a>A rebuke of the same old man, when he had come to my cell in the middle of the night.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.v.xxxv-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.v.xxxv-p2.1"></a>The</span> same Theodore came unexpectedly to my cell in the dead of night, with paternal inquisitiveness seeking what I—an unformed anchorite as I was—might be doing by myself; and when he had found me there already, as I had finished my vesper office, beginning to refresh my wearied body, and lying down on a mat, he sighed from the bottom of his heart, and calling me by name, said, “How many, O John, are at this hour communing with God, and embracing Him, and detaining Him with them, while you are deprived of so great light, enfeebled as you are with lazy sleep!”</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.v.xxxv-p3"></a>And since the virtues of the fathers and the grace given to them have tempted us to turn aside to a story like this, I think it well to record in this volume a noteworthy deed of charity, which we experienced from the kindness of that most excellent man Archebius, that the purity of continence grafted on to a work of charity may more readily shine forth, being embellished with a pleasing variety. <a name="page_246"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 246</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.v.xxxv-Page_246"></a>For the duty of fasting is then rendered acceptable to God, when it is made perfect by the fruits of charity.</p>
