 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.vii.v.viii-p1"></a>How this interchange of titles does not interfere with His Divine power.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.vii.v.viii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.vii.v.viii-p2.1"></a>For</span> certainly when the evangelist says that He came into the world by whom the world itself was made, and that He was made the Son of man, who is as God the creator of the world, it makes no difference what particular title is used, as God in all cases is meant. For His condescension and will do not interfere with His Divinity, since they the rather prove His Divinity, because whatever He willed came to pass. Therefore also because He willed it, He came into the world; and because He willed it, He was born a man; and because He willed it, He was termed the Son of man. For just as there are so many words, so are they powers belonging to God. The variety of names in Him does not take anything away from the efficacy of His power. Whatever may be the names given Him, in all cases it is one and the same Person. Though there may be some variety in the appearance of His titles, yet there is but a single Divine Person (Majestas) meant by all the names.</p>
