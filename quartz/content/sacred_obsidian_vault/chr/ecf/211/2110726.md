 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iv.viii.xvii-p1"></a>On the fact that not every devil has the power of suggesting every passion to men.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iv.viii.xvii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iv.viii.xvii-p2.1"></a>But</span> we ought to know this, that not all devils can implant all the passions in men, but that certain spirits brood over each sin, and that some gloat over uncleanness and filthy lusts, others over blasphemy, others are more particularly devoted to anger and wrath, others thrive on gloominess, others are pacified with vainglory and pride; and each one implants in the hearts of men that sin, in which he himself revels, and they cannot implant their special vices all at one time, but in turn, according as the opportunity of time or place, or a man, who is open to their suggestions, excites them.</p>
