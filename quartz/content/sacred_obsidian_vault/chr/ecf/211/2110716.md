 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iv.viii.vii-p1"></a>A question on the roving tendency of the mind and the attacks of spiritual wickedness.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iv.viii.vii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iv.viii.vii-p2.1"></a>Germanus</span>: Perhaps this tendency of the mind to rove might to some extent be checked were it not that so great a swam of enemies surrounded it, and ceaselessly urged it toward what it has no wish for, or rather whither the roving character of its own nature drives it. And since such numberless foes, and those so powerful and terrible, surround it, we should not fancy that it was possible for them to be withstood especially by this weak flesh of ours, were we not encouraged to this view by your words as if by oracles from heaven.</p>
