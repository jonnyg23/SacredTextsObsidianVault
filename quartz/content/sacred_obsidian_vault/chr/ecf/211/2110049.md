 <p class="skip"><a name="ii.iv.i.xii-p1"></a>“<span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.i.xii-p1.1"></a>In</span> this monastery I saw two old men who were said to have already lived there for forty years, and in fact never to have departed from it. I do not think that I should pass by all mention of these men, since, indeed, I heard the following statement made regarding their virtues on the testimony of the Abbot himself, and all the brethren, that in the case of one of them, the sun never beheld him feasting, and in the case of the other, the sun never saw him angry.”</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.iv.i.xii-p2"></a>Upon this, the Gaul looking at me exclaims: “Would that a friend of yours—I do not wish to mention his name—were now present; I should greatly like him to hear of that example, since we have had too much experience of his bitter anger in the persons of a great many people. Nevertheless, as I hear, he has lately forgiven his enemies; and, in these circumstances, were he to hear of the conduct of that man, he would be more and more strengthened in his forgiving course by the example thus set before him, and would feel that it is an admirable virtue not to fall under the influence of anger. I will not indeed deny that he had just reasons for his wrath; but where the battle is hard, the crown of victory is all the more glorious. For this reason, I think, if you will allow me to say so, that a certain man was justly to be praised, because when an ungrateful freedman abandoned him he rather pitied than inveighed against the fugitive. And, indeed, he was not even angry with the man by whom he seems to have been carried off.” <a name="fr_98"></a><a href="#fn_98"><font size="1">99</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="ii.iv.i.xii-p4"></a>Upon this I remarked: “Unless Postumianus had given us that example of overcoming anger, I would have been very angry on account of the departure of the fugitive; but since it is not lawful to be angry, all remembrance of such things, as it annoys us, ought to be blotted from our minds. Let us rather, Postumianus, listen to what you have got to say.”</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.iv.i.xii-p5"></a>“I will do,” says he, “Sulpitius, what you request, as I see you are all so desirous of hearing me. But remember that I do not address my speech to you without hope of a larger recompense; I shall gladly perform what you require, provided that, when ere long my turn comes, you do not refuse what I ask.”</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.iv.i.xii-p6"></a>“We indeed,” said I, “have nothing by <a name="page_30"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 30</font></a> <a name="ii.iv.i.xii-Page_30"></a>means of which we can return the obligation we shall lie under to you even without a larger return. <a name="fr_99"></a><a href="#fn_99"><font size="1">100</font></a>
  However, command us as to anything you have thought about, provided you satisfy our desires, as you have already begun to do, for your speech conveys to us true delight.”</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.iv.i.xii-p8"></a>“I will stint nothing,” said Postumianus, “of your desires; and inasmuch as you have recognized the virtue of one recluse, I shall go on to relate to you some few things about more such persons.</p>
