 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.vi.iii.iv-p1"></a>Of the excellence which the aforesaid old man showed in the system of the anchorites.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.vi.iii.iv-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.vi.iii.iv-p2.1"></a>If</span> then anyone else delights in the recesses of the desert and would forget all human intercourse and say with Jeremiah: “I have not desired the day of man: Thou knowest,” <a name="fr_2107"></a><a href="#fn_2107"><font size="1">2108</font></a>
  I confess that by the blessing of Gods grace, I also secured or at any rate tried to secure this. And so by the kind gift of the Lord I remember that I was often caught up into such an ecstasy as to forget that I was clothed with the burden of a weak body, and my soul on a sudden forgot all external notions and entirely cut itself off from all material objects, so that neither my eyes nor ears performed their proper functions. And my soul was so filled with divine meditations  <a name="page_491"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 491</font></a> <a name="iv.vi.iii.iv-Page_491"></a>and spiritual contemplations that often in the evening I did not know whether I had taken any food and on the next day was very doubtful whether I had broken my fast yesterday. For which reason, a supply of food for seven days, i.e., seven sets of biscuits were set apart in a sort of hand-basket, <a name="fr_2108"></a><a href="#fn_2108"><font size="1">2109</font></a>
  and laid by on Saturday, that there might be no doubt when supper had been omitted; and by this plan another mistake also from forgetfulness was obviated, for when the number of cakes was finished it showed that the course of the week was over, and that the services of the same day had come round, and that the festival and holy day and services of the congregation could not escape the notice of the solitary. But even if that ecstasy of mind of which we have spoken should happen to interfere with this arrangement, yet still the method of the days work would show the number of the days and check the mistake. And to pass over in silence the other advantages of the desert (for it is not our business to treat of their number and quantity, but rather of the aim of solitude and the Cœnobium) I will the rather briefly explain the reasons why I preferred to leave it, which you also wanted to know, and will in a concise discourse glance at all those fruits of solitude which I mentioned, and show to what greater advantages on the other side they ought to be held inferior.</p>
