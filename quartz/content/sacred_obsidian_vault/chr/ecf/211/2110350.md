 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.iv.xxi-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.iv.xxi-p2.1"></a>We</span> have been told of brethren in whose week there was such a scarcity of wood that they had not enough to prepare the usual food for the brethren; and when it had been ordered by the Abbots authority that until more could be brought and fetched, they should content themselves with dried food, <a name="fr_777"></a><a href="#fn_777"><font size="1">778</font></a>
  though this was agreed to by all and no one could expect any cooked food; still these men as if they were cheated of the fruit and reward of their labour and service, if they did not prepare the food for their brethren according to custom in the order of their turn—imposed upon themselves such uncalled-for labour and care that in those dry and sterile regions where wood cannot possibly be procured unless it is cut from the fruit trees (for there are no wild shrubs found there as with us), they wander about through the wide deserts, and traversing the wilderness which stretches towards the Dead Sea, <a name="fr_778"></a><a href="#fn_778"><font size="1">779</font></a>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iv.iii.iv.xxi-p4"></a> This shows that Cassian is here writing about the monks of Palestine, not those of Egypt, who (according to the next chapter) had a permanent cook. There is a further allusion to and description of this desert in the Conference VI. i.</p>
