 <a href="2111130.htm">Chapter IX. He corroborates this statement by the authority of the old prophets.</a><br>
 <a href="2111131.htm">Chapter X. He proves Christ's Divinity from the blasphemy of Judaizing Jews as well as from the confession of converts to the faith of Christ.</a><br>
 <a href="2111132.htm">Chapter XI. He returns to the prophecy of Isaiah.</a><br>
 <a href="2111133.htm">Chapter XII. How the title of Saviour is given to Christ in one sense, and to men in another.</a><br>
 <a href="2111134.htm">Chapter XIII. He explains who are those in whose person the Prophet Isaiah says: “Thou art our God, and we knew Thee not.”</a><br>
 <a href="2111135.htm">Book V.</a><br>

 <a href="2111137.htm">Chapter II. That the doctrine of Nestorius is closely connected with the error of the Pelagians.</a><br>
 <a href="2111138.htm">Chapter III. How this participation in Divinity which the Pelagians and Nestorians attribute to Christ, is common to all holy men.</a><br>
 <a href="2111139.htm">Chapter IV. What the difference is between Christ and the saints.</a><br>
 <a href="2111140.htm">Chapter V. That before His birth in time Christ was always called God by the prophets.</a><br>
 <a href="2111141.htm">Chapter VI. He illustrates the same doctrine by passages from the New Testament.</a><br>
 <a href="2111142.htm">Chapter VII. He shows again from the union in Christ of two natures in one Person that what belongs to the Divine nature may rightly be ascribed to man, and what belongs to the human nature to God.</a><br>
 <a href="2111143.htm">Chapter VIII. He confirms the judgment of the Apostle by the authority of the Lord.</a><br>
 <a href="2111144.htm">Chapter IX. Since those marvellous works which from the days of Moses were shown to the children of Israel are attributed to Christ, it follows that He must have existed long before His birth in time.</a><br>
 <a href="2111145.htm">Chapter X. He explains what it means to confess, and what it means to dissolve Jesus.</a><br>
 <a href="2111146.htm">Chapter XI. The mystery of the Lord's Incarnation clearly implies the Divinity of Christ.</a><br>

 <a href="2111150.htm">Chapter XV. What the prayers of the saints for the coming of Messiah contained; and what was the nature of that longing of theirs.</a><br>
 <a href="2111151.htm">Book VI.</a><br>
 <a href="2111152.htm">Chapter I. From the miracle of the feeding of the multitude from five barley loaves and two fishes he shows the majesty of Divine Power.</a><br>
 <a href="2111153.htm">Chapter II. The author adapts the mystery of the number seven (made up of the five loaves and two fishes) to his own work.</a><br>
 <a href="2111154.htm">Chapter III. He refutes his opponent by the testimony of the Council of Antioch.</a><br>
 <a href="2111155.htm">Chapter IV. How the Creed has authority Divine as well as human.</a><br>
 <a href="2111156.htm">Chapter V. He proceeds against his opponent with the choicest arguments, and shows that we ought to hold fast to the religion which we have received from our fathers.</a><br>

 <a href="2111158.htm">Chapter VII. He continues the same line of argument drawn from the Creed of Antioch.</a><br>
 <a href="2111159.htm">Chapter VIII. How it can be said that Christ came and was born of a Virgin.</a><br>
 <a href="2111160.htm">Chapter IX. Again he convicts his opponent of deadly heresy by his own confession.</a><br>
 <a href="2111161.htm">Chapter X. He inveighs against him because though he has forsaken the Catholic religion, he nevertheless presumes to teach in the Church, to sacrifice, and to give decisions.</a><br>
 <a href="2111162.htm">Chapter XI. He removes the silent objection of heretics who want to recant the profession of their faith made in childhood.</a><br>
 <a href="2111163.htm">Chapter XII. Christ crucified is an offence and foolishness to those who declare that He was a mere man.</a><br>
 <a href="2111164.htm">Chapter XIII. He replies to the objection in which they say that the child born ought to be of one substance with the mother.</a><br>
 <a href="2111165.htm">Chapter XIV. He compares this erroneous view with the teaching of the Pelagians.</a><br>
 <a href="2111166.htm">Chapter XV. He shows that those who patronize this false teaching acknowledge two Christs.</a><br>
 <a href="2111167.htm">Chapter XVI. He shows further that this teaching is destructive of the confession of the Trinity.</a><br>
 <a href="2111168.htm">Chapter XVII. Those who are under an error in one point of the Catholic religion, lose the whole faith, and all the value of the faith.</a><br>
 <a href="2111169.htm">Chapter XVIII. He directs his discourse upon his antagonist with whom he is disputing, and begs him to return to his senses. The sacrament of reconciliation is necessary for the lapsed for their salvation.</a><br>

 <a href="2111171.htm">Chapter XX. He shows from what has been said that we do not mean that God was mortal or of flesh before the worlds, although Christ, who is God from eternity and was made man in time, is but one Person.</a><br>
 <a href="2111172.htm">Chapter XXI. The authority of Holy Scripture teaches that Christ existed from all eternity.</a><br>
 <a href="2111173.htm">Chapter XXII. The hypostatic union enables us to ascribe to God what belongs to the flesh in Christ.</a><br>
 <a href="2111174.htm">Chapter XXIII. That the figure Synecdoche, in which the part stands for the whole, is very familiar to the Holy Scripture.</a><br>
 <a href="2111175.htm">Book VII.</a><br>
 <a href="2111176.htm">Chapter I. As he is going to reply to the slanders of his opponents he implores the aid of Divine grace to teach a prayer to be used by those who undertake to dispute with heretics.</a><br>

 <a href="2111178.htm">Chapter III. He replies to the cavil that the one who is born must be of one substance with the one who bears.</a><br>
 <a href="2111179.htm">Chapter IV. How God has shown His Omnipotence in His birth in time as well as in everything else.</a><br>
 <a href="2111180.htm">Chapter V. He shows by proofs drawn from nature itself, that the law which his opponents lay down; viz., that the one born ought to be of one substance with the one who bears, fails to hold good in many cases.</a><br>
 <a href="2111181.htm">Chapter VI. He refutes another argument of Nestorius, in which he tried to make out that Christ was like Adam in every point.</a><br>
 <a href="2111182.htm">Chapter VII. Heretics usually cover their doctrines with a cloak of holy Scripture.</a><br>
 <a href="2111183.htm">Chapter VIII. The heretics attribute to Christ only the shadow of Divinity, and so assert that he is to be worshipped together with God but not as God.</a><br>
 <a href="2111184.htm">Chapter IX. How those are wrong who say that the birth of Christ was a secret, since it was clearly shown even to the patriarch Jacob.</a><br>
 <a href="2111185.htm">Chapter X. He collects more witnesses of the same fact.</a><br>
 <a href="2111186.htm">Chapter XI. How the devil was forced by many reasons to the view that Christ was God.</a><br>
 <a href="2111187.htm">Chapter XII. He compares this notion and reasonable suspicion of the devil with the obstinate and inflexible idea of his opponents, and shows that this last is worse and more blasphemous than the former.</a><br>
 <a href="2111188.htm">Chapter XIII. How the devil always retained this notion of Christ's Divinity (because of His secret working which he experienced) even up to His Cross and Death.</a><br>
 <a href="2111189.htm">Chapter XIV. He shows how heretics pervert holy Scripture, by replying to the argument drawn from the Apostle's words, “Without father, without mother,” etc.: Heb. vii.</a><br>
 <a href="2111190.htm">Chapter XV. How Christ could be said by the Apostle to be without genealogy.</a><br>
 <a href="2111191.htm">Chapter XVI. He shows that like the devil when tempting Christ, the heretics garble and pervert holy Scripture.</a><br>
 <a href="2111192.htm">Chapter XVII. That the glory and honour of Christ is not to be ascribed to the Holy Ghost in such a way as to deny that it proceeds from Christ Himself, as if all that excellency, which was in Him, was another's and proceeded from another source.</a><br>
 <a href="2111193.htm">Chapter XVIII. How we are to understand the Apostle's words: “He appeared in the flesh, was justified in the Spirit,” etc.</a><br>
 <a href="2111194.htm">Chapter XIX. That it was not only the Spirit, but Christ Himself also who made Him to be feared.</a><br>
 <a href="2111195.htm">Chapter XX. He tries by stronger and weightier arguments to destroy that notion.</a><br>
 <a href="2111196.htm">Chapter XXI. That it must be ascribed equally to Christ and the Holy Ghost that His flesh and Humanity became the temple of God.</a><br>
 <a href="2111197.htm">Chapter XXII. That the raising up of Christ into heaven is not to be ascribed to the Spirit alone.</a><br>
 <a href="2111198.htm">Chapter XXIII. He continues the same argument to show that Christ had no need of another's glory as He had a glory of His own.</a><br>
 <a href="2111199.htm">Chapter XXIV. He supports this doctrine by the authority of the blessed Hilary.</a><br>
 <a href="2111200.htm">Chapter XXV. He shows that Ambrose agrees with S. Hilary.</a><br>
 <a href="2111201.htm">Chapter XXVI. He adds to the foregoing the testimony of S. Jerome.</a><br>
 <a href="2111202.htm">Chapter XXVII. To the foregoing he adds Rufinus and the blessed Augustine.</a><br>
 <a href="2111203.htm">Chapter XXVIII. As he is going to produce the testimony of Greek or Eastern Bishops, he brings forward in the first place S. Gregory Nazianzen.</a><br>
 <a href="2111204.htm">Chapter XXIX. In the next place he puts the authority of S. Athanasius.</a><br>
 <a href="2111205.htm">Chapter XXX. He adds also S. John Chrysostom.</a><br>
 <a href="2111206.htm">Chapter XXXI. He bemoans the unhappy lot of Constantinople, owing to the misfortune which has overtaken it from that heretic; and at the same time he urges the citizens to stand fast in the ancient Catholic and ancestral faith.</a><br>
