 <p class="skip"><a name="ii.iv.iii.iii-p1"></a>“<span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.iii.iii-p1.1"></a>The</span> following is a small matter which I learned lately from the narration of Arpagius the presbyter, but I do not think it ought to be passed over. The wife of the courtier Avitianus had sent some oil to Martin, that he might bless it (such is the custom) so as to be ready when needful to meet different causes of disease. It was contained in a glass jar of a shape which, round throughout, gradually bulges <a name="fr_128"></a><a href="#fn_128"><font size="1">129</font></a>
  out towards the middle, with a long neck; but the hollow of the extended neck was not filled, because it is the custom to fill vessels of the kind in such a way that the top may be left free for the knobs which stop up the jar. The presbyter testified that he saw the oil increase under the blessing of Martin, so much that, the abundance of it overflowing the jar, it ran down from the top in every direction. He added that it bubbled up with the same <a name="fr_129"></a><a href="#fn_129"><font size="1">130</font></a>
  effect, while the vessel was being carried back to the mistress of the household; for the oil so steadily flowed over in the hands of the boy carrying it, that the abundance of the liquid, thus pouring down, covered all his garment. He said, moreover, that the lady received the vessel so full even to the brim, that (as the same presbyter tells <a name="fr_130"></a><a href="#fn_130"><font size="1">131</font></a>
  us at the present day) there was no room in that jar for inserting the stopper by which people are accustomed to close those vessels, the contents of which are to be preserved with special care. That, too, was a remarkable thing that happened to this man.” Here he looked at me. “He had set down a glass vessel containing oil blessed by Martin in a pretty high window; and a boy of the family, not knowing that a jar was there, drew towards him the cloth covering it, with rather much violence. The vessel, in consequence, fell down on the marble pavement. Upon this, all were filled with dread lest the blessing of God, bestowed on the vessel by Martin, had been lost; but the jar was found as safe as ever, just as if it had fallen on the softest feathers. Now, this result should be ascribed, not so much to chance, as to the power of Martin, whose blessing could not possibly perish.</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.iv.iii.iii-p5"></a>“There is this, too, which was effected by a certain person, whose name, because he is present, and has forbidden it to be mentioned, shall be suppressed: Saturninus too, who is now with us, was present on the occasion referred to. A dog was barking at us in a somewhat disagreeable manner.  I command thee, said the person in question, in the name of Martin, to be quiet. The dog—his barking seemed to stick in his throat, and one might have thought that his tongue had been cut out—<i>was</i> silent. Thus it is really a small matter that Martin himself performed miracles: believe me that other people also have accomplished many things in his name.</p>
