 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iv.ix.i-p1"></a>Of the hospitality of Abbot Serenus.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iv.ix.i-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iv.ix.i-p2.1"></a>When</span> we had finished the duties of the day, and the congregation had been dismissed from Church we returned to the old mans cell, and enjoyed a most sumptuous repast. For instead of the sauce which with a few drops of oil spread over it was usually set on the table for his daily meal, he mixed a little decoction and poured over it a somewhat more liberal allowance of oil than usual; for each of them when he is going to partake of his daily repast, pours those drops of oil on, not that he may receive any enjoyment from the taste of it (for so limited is the supply that it is hardly enough I will not say to line the passage of his throat and jaws, but even to pass down it) but that using it, he may keep down the pride of his heart (which is certain to creep in stealthily and surely if his abstinence is any stricter) and the incitements to vainglory, for as his abstinence is practised with the greater secrecy, and is carried on without anyone to see it, so much the more subtly does it never cease to tempt the man who conceals it. Then he set before us table salt, and three olives each: after which he produced a basket containing parched vetches which they call trogalia, <a name="fr_1515"></a><a href="#fn_1515"><font size="1">1516</font></a>
  from which we each took five grains, two prunes and a fig apiece. For it is considered wrong for anyone to exceed that amount in that desert. And when we had finished this repast and had begun to ask him again for his promised solution of the question, “Let us hear,” said the old man, “your question, the consideration of which we postponed till the present time.”</p>
