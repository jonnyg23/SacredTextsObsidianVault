 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iii.xii.xxvi-p1"></a>That a man whose foundation is bad, sinks daily from bad to worse.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.xii.xxvi-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.xii.xxvi-p2.1"></a>Those</span> then who are possessed by such distrust of mind, and who through the devils own want of faith fall away from that spark of faith, by which they seemed in the early days of their conversion to be enkindled, begin more anxiously to watch over the money which before they had begun to give away, and treasure it up with greater avarice, as men who cannot recover again what they have once wasted: or—what is still worse—take back what they had formerly cast away: or else (which is a third and most disgusting kind of sin), collect what they never before possessed, and thus are convicted of having gone no further in forsaking the world than merely to take the name and style of monk. With this beginning therefore, and on this bad and rotten foundation, it is a matter of course that the whole superstructure of faults must rise, nor can anything be built on such villainous foundations, except what will bring the wretched soul to the ground with a hopeless collapse.</p>
