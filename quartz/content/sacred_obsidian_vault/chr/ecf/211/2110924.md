 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.v.viii.iv-p1"></a>Abbot Josephs question and our answer on the origin of our anxiety.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.v.viii.iv-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.v.viii.iv-p2.1"></a>Then</span> the venerable Joseph saw that we were in rather low spirits, and, guessing that this was not the case without reason, addressed us in these words of the patriarch Joseph: “Why are your faces sad today?” <a name="fr_2013"></a><a href="#fn_2013"><font size="1">2014</font></a>
  to whom we answered: We are not like those bond slaves of Pharaoh who have seen a dream and there is none to interpret it, but I admit that we have passed a sleepless night and there is no one to lighten the weight of our troubles unless the Lord may remove them by your wisdom. Then he, who recalled the excellence of the patriarch both by his merits and name, said: Does not the cure of mans perplexities come from the Lord? Let them be brought forward: for the Divine Compassion is able to give a remedy for them by means of our advice according to your faith.</p>
