 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iii.v.xxxiv-p1"></a>Of the saying of the same old man, through which he taught by what efforts a monk can acquire a knowledge of the Scriptures.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.v.xxxiv-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.v.xxxiv-p2.1"></a>This</span> man therefore, when some of the brethren were wondering at the splendid light of his knowledge and were asking of him some meanings of Scripture, said that a monk who wanted to acquire a knowledge of the Scriptures ought not to spend his labour on the works of commentators, but rather to keep all the efforts of his mind and intentions of his heart set on purifying himself from carnal vices: for when these are driven out, at once the eyes of the heart, as if the veil of the passions were removed, will begin as it were naturally to gaze on the mysteries <a name="fr_869"></a><a href="#fn_869"><font size="1">870</font></a>
  of Scripture: since they were not declared to us by the grace of the Holy Spirit in order that they should remain unknown and obscure; but they are rendered obscure by our fault, as the veil of our sins covers the eyes of the heart, and when these are restored to their natural state of health, the mere reading of Holy Scripture is by itself amply sufficient for beholding the true knowledge, nor do they need the aid of commentators, just as these eyes of flesh need no mans teaching how to see, provided that they are free from dimness or the darkness of blindness. For this reason there have arisen so great differences and mistakes among commentators because most of them, paying no sort of attention towards purifying the mind, rush into the work of interpreting the Scriptures, and in proportion to the density or impurity of their heart form opinions that are at variance with and contrary to each others and to the faith, and so are unable to take in the light of truth.</p>
