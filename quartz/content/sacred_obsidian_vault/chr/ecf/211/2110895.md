 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.v.vii.iv-p1"></a>A question whether anything that is really useful should be performed even against a brothers wish.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.v.vii.iv-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.v.vii.iv-p2.1"></a>Germanus</span>: What then? If when one party wants to do something which he sees is useful and profitable according to the mind of God, the other does not give his consent, ought it to be performed even against the wish of the brother, or should it be thrown on one side as he wants?</p>
