 <p> <a name="iv.iii.iii.v"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iv.iii.iii.v-p0.1"></a>Chapter V.</h4>  
 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iii.iii.v-p1"></a>How they ought not to go back to bed again after the Mattin prayers.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.iii.v-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.iii.v-p2.1"></a>But</span> some in this province, not knowing the reason why this office was appointed and introduced, go back again to bed after their Mattin prayers are finished, and in spite of it fall into that very habit to check which our Elders instituted this service. For they are eager to finish it at that hour, that an opportunity maybe given, to those who are inclined to be indifferent and not careful enough, to go back to bed again, which most certainly ought not to be done (as we showed more fully in the previous book when describing the service of the Egyptians), <a name="fr_738"></a><a href="#fn_738"><font size="1">739</font></a>
  for fear lest the force of  <a name="page_216"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 216</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.iii.v-Page_216"></a>our natural passions should be aroused and stain that purity of ours which was gained by humble confession and prayers before the dawn, or some illusion of the enemy pollute us, or even the repose of a pure and natural sleep interfere with the fervour of our spirit and make us lazy and slothful throughout the whole day, as we are chilled by the sluggishness caused by sleep. And to avoid this the Egyptians, and especially as they are in the habit of rising at fixed times even before the cock-crow, when the canonical office <a name="fr_739"></a><a href="#fn_739"><font size="1">740</font></a>
  has been celebrated, afterwards prolong their vigils even to daylight, that the morning light when it comes on them may find them established in fervour of spirit, and keep them still more careful and fervent all through the day, as it has found them prepared for the conflict and strengthened against their daily struggle with the devil by the practice of nocturnal vigils and spiritual meditation.</p>
