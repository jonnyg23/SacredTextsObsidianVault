 <p> <a name="iv.vii.iii.i"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iv.vii.iii.i-p0.1"></a>Chapter I.</h4>  
 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.vii.iii.i-p1"></a>How the errors of later heretics have been condemned and refuted in the persons of their authors and originators.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.vii.iii.i-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.vii.iii.i-p2.1"></a>As</span> we began by setting down in the first book some things by which we showed that our new heretic is but an offshoot from ancient stocks of heresy, the due condemnation of the earlier heretics ought to be enough to secure a sentence of due condemnation for him. For as he has the same roots and grows up out of the same fallow <a name="fr_2384"></a><a href="#fn_2384"><font size="1">2385</font></a>
  he has already been amply condemned in the persons of his predecessors, especially as those who went wrong immediately before these men very properly condemned the very thing which these men are now asserting, <a name="fr_2385"></a><a href="#fn_2385"><font size="1">2386</font></a>
  so that the examples of their own party ought to be amply sufficient for them in both directions; viz., that of those who were restored and that of those who were condemned. For if they are capable of amendment they have their remedy set forth in the correction of their own party. If they are incapable of it they receive their sentence in the condemnation  <a name="page_556"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 556</font></a> <a name="iv.vii.iii.i-Page_556"></a>of their own folk. But that we may not be thought to have prejudged the case against them instead of fairly judging it, we will produce their actual pestilent assertions, or rather I should say their blasphemous folly: taking “above all the shield of faith, and the sword of the Spirit which is the Word of God,” <a name="fr_2386"></a><a href="#fn_2386"><font size="1">2387</font></a>
  that when the head of the old serpent rises once more, the same sword of the Divine Word which formerly severed it in the case of those ancient dragons may even now cut it off in the persons of these new serpents. For since the error of these is the same as that of those former ones, the decapitation of those ought to be counted as the decapitation of these; and as the serpents revive and emit pestilent blasts against the Lords church, and cause some to fail through their hissing, we must on account of these new diseases add a fresh remedy to those older cures, so that even if what has already been done prove insufficient to heal <a name="fr_2387"></a><a href="#fn_2387"><font size="1">2388</font></a>
  the malady, what we are now doing may be adequate to restore those who are suffering from it.</p>
