 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iii.xi.viii-p1"></a>How vainglory is not allayed either in the desert or through advancing years.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.xi.viii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.xi.viii-p2.1"></a>Other</span> vices, as we said, are sometimes allayed by the advantages of position, and when the matter of the sin and the occasion and opportunity for it are removed, grow slack, and are diminished: but this one penetrates the deserts with the man who is flying from it, nor can it be shut out from any place, nor when outward material for it is removed does it fail. For it is simply encouraged by the achievements of the virtues of the man whom it attacks. For all other vices, as we said above, are sometimes diminished by the lapse of time, and disappear: to this one length of life, unless it is supported by skilful diligence and prudent discretion, is no hindrance, but actually supplies it with new fuel for vanity.</p>
