 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iii.vii.xviii-p1"></a>That if we want to imitate the apostles we ought not to live according to our own prescriptions, but to follow their example.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.vii.xviii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.vii.xviii-p2.1"></a>Wherefore</span> if we want to obey the gospel precept, and to show ourselves the followers of the Apostle and the whole primitive church, or of the fathers who in our own days succeeded to their virtues and perfection, we should not acquiesce in our own prescriptions, promising ourselves perfection from this wretched and lukewarm condition of ours: but following their footsteps, we should by no means aim at looking after our own interests, but should seek out the discipline and system of a monastery, that we may in very truth renounce this world; preserving nothing of those things which we have despised through the temptation of want of faith; and should look for our daily food, not from any store of money of our own, but from our own labours.</p>
