 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.vi.iii.vii-p1"></a>A question on the fruits of the Cœnobium and the desert.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.vi.iii.vii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.vi.iii.vii-p2.1"></a>Germanus</span>: Since it is evident that you have not, like so many, just touched the mere outskirts of each mode of life, but have ascended to the very heights, we should like to know what is the end of the Cœnobites life and what the end of the hermits. For no one can doubt that no man can discourse with greater fulness or fidelity on these subjects than one who, taught by long use and experience, has followed them both, and so can by veracious teaching show us their value and aim.</p>
