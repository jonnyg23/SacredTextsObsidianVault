 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.vi.v.viii-p1"></a>How Theonas exhorted his wife that she too should make her renunciation.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.vi.v.viii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.vi.v.viii-p2.1"></a>And</span> when he had heard this the blessed Theonas was fired with an uncontrollable  <a name="page_506"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 506</font></a> <a name="iv.vi.v.viii-Page_506"></a>desire for the perfection of the gospel, and, committed, as it were, the seed of the word, which he had received in a fruitful heart, to the deep and broken furrows of his bosom, as he was greatly humiliated and conscience-stricken because the old man had said not only that he had failed to attain to the perfection of the gospel, but also that he had scarcely fulfilled the commands of the law; since though he was accustomed every year to pay the tithes of his fruits as alms, yet he mourned that he had never even heard of the law of the firstfruits; and even if he had in the same way fulfilled this, he humbly confessed that still he would in the old mans view have been very far from the perfection of the gospel. And so he returned home sad and filled with that sorrow which worketh repentance unto salvation, <a name="fr_2177"></a><a href="#fn_2177"><font size="1">2178</font></a>
  and of his own will and determination turns all his wifes care and anxiety of mind towards salvation; and began to stir her up to the same eager desire with which he himself had been inflamed, with the same sort of exhortations, and with tears day and night to urge her that together they might serve God in sanctity and chastity, telling her that their conversion to a better life ought not to be deferred because a vain hope in their youth would be no argument against the inevitableness of a sudden death, which carries off boys and youths and young persons equally with old men.</p>
