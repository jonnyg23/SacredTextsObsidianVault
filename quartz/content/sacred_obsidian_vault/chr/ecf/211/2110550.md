 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iii.xii.xix-p1"></a>How this faith concerning the grace of God was delivered to us by the ancient Fathers.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.xii.xix-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.xii.xix-p2.1"></a>This</span> then is that humility towards God, this is that genuine faith of the ancient fathers which still remains intact among their successors. And to this faith, the apostolic virtues, which they so often showed, bear an undoubted witness, not only among us but also among infidels and unbelievers: for keeping in simplicity of heart the simple faith of the fishermen they did not receive it in a worldly spirit through dialectical syllogisms or the eloquence of a Cicero, but learnt by the experience of a pure life, and stainless actions, and by correcting their faults, and (to speak more truly) by visible proofs, that the character of perfection is to be found in that faith without which neither piety towards God, nor purification from sin, nor amendment of life, nor perfection of virtue can be secured.</p>
