 <p> <a name="iv.vii.vii.xxiii"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iv.vii.vii.xxiii-p0.1"></a>Chapter XXIII.</h4>  
 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.vii.vii.xxiii-p1"></a>That the figure Synecdoche, in which the part stands for the whole, is very familiar to the Holy Scripture.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.vii.vii.xxiii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.vii.vii.xxiii-p2.1"></a>Whatever</span> then you say of the Lord Jesus Christ, you say of the whole person, and in mentioning the Son of God you mention the Son of man, and in mentioning the Son of man you mention the Son of God: by the grammatical trope synecdoche in which you understand the whole from the parts, and a part is put for the whole: and the holy Scriptures certainly show this, as in them the Lord often uses this trope, and teaches in this way about others and would have us understand about Himself in the same way. For sometimes days, and things, and men, and times are de<a name="page_603"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 603</font></a> <a name="iv.vii.vii.xxiii-Page_603"></a>noted in holy Scripture in no other fashion. As in this case where God declares that Israel shall serve the Egyptians for four hundred years, and says to Abraham: “Know thou that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land not theirs, and they shall bring them under bondage and afflict them four hundred years.” <a name="fr_2587"></a><a href="#fn_2587"><font size="1">2588</font></a>
  Whereas if you take into account the whole time after that God spoke, they are more than four hundred: but if you only reckon the time in which they were in slavery, they are less. And in giving this period indeed, unless you understand it in this way, we must think that the Word of God lied (and away with such a thought from Christian minds!). But since from the time of the Divine utterance, the whole period of their lives amounted to more than four hundred years, and their bondage endured for not nearly four hundred, you must understand that the part is to be taken for the whole, or the whole for the part. There is also a similar way of representing days and nights, where, when in the case of either division of time one day is meant, either period is shown by a portion of a single period. And indeed in this way the difficulty about the time of our Lords Passion is cleared up: for whereas the Lord prophesied that after the model of the prophet Jonah, the Son of man would be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth, <a name="fr_2588"></a><a href="#fn_2588"><font size="1">2589</font></a>
  and whereas after the sixth day of the week on which He was crucified, He was only in hell <a name="fr_2589"></a><a href="#fn_2589"><font size="1">2590</font></a>
  for one day and two nights, how can we show the truth of the Divine words? Surely by the trope of Synecdoche, i.e., because to the day on which He was crucified the previous night belongs, and to the night on which He rose again, the coming day; and so when there is added the night which preceded the day belonging to it, and the day which followed the night belonging to it, we see that there is nothing lacking to the whole period of time, which is made up of its portions. The holy Scriptures abound in such instances of ways of speaking: but it would take too long to relate them all. For so when the Psalm says, “What is a man that Thou art mindful of Him,” <a name="fr_2590"></a><a href="#fn_2590"><font size="1">2591</font></a>
  from the part we understand the whole, as while only one man is mentioned the whole human race is meant. So also where Ahab sinned we are told that the people sinned. Where—though all are mentioned, a part is to be understood from the whole. John also the Lords forerunner says: “After me cometh a man who is preferred before me for He was before me.” <a name="fr_2591"></a><a href="#fn_2591"><font size="1">2592</font></a>
  How then does He mean that He would come after Him, whom He shows to be before Him? For if this is understood of a man who was afterwards born, how was he before him? But if it is taken of the Word how is it, “a <i>man</i> cometh after me?” Except that in the one Lord Jesus Christ is shown both the posteriority of the manhood and the precedence of the Godhead. And so the result is that one and the same Lord was before him and came after him: for according to the flesh He was posterior in time to John; and according to His Deity was before all men. And so he, when he named that man, denoted both the manhood and the Word, for as the Lord Jesus Christ the Son of God was complete in both manhood and Divinity <a name="fr_2592"></a><a href="#fn_2592"><font size="1">2593</font></a>
  in mentioning one of these natures in Him he denoted the whole person. And what need is there of anything further? I think that the day would fail me if I were to try to collect or to tell everything that could be said on this subject. And what we have already said is enough, at any rate on this part of the subject, both for the exposition of the Creed, and for the requirements of our case, and for the limits of our book.</p>
