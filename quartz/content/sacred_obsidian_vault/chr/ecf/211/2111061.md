 <p> <a name="iv.vi.viii.i"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iv.vi.viii.i-p0.1"></a>Chapter I.</h4>  
 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.vi.viii.i-p1"></a>How we laid bare the secrets of our thoughts to Abbot Abraham.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.vi.viii.i-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.vi.viii.i-p2.1"></a>This</span> twenty-fourth Conference of Abbot Abraham <a name="fr_2291"></a><a href="#fn_2291"><font size="1">2292</font></a>
  is by the favour of Christ produced, which concludes the traditions and decisions of all the Elders; and when by the aid of your prayers it has been finished, as the number mystically corresponds to that of the four and twenty Elders who are said in the holy Apocalypse <a name="fr_2292"></a><a href="#fn_2292"><font size="1">2293</font></a>
  to offer their crowns to the Lamb, we think that we shall have paid the debt of all our promises. And henceforth if these four and twenty Elders of ours have been crowned with any glory for the sake of their teaching, they shall with bowed heads offer it to the Lamb who was slain for the salvation of the world: for He it was Who vouchsafed  <a name="page_532"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 532</font></a> <a name="iv.vi.viii.i-Page_532"></a>for the honour of His name to grant to them such exalted feelings and to us whatever words were needful to set forth such profound thoughts. And the merits of His gift must be referred to the Author of all good, to whom the more is owed, as the more is paid. Therefore with anxious confession we laid before this Abraham the impulse of our thoughts, whereby we were urged by daily perplexities of our mind to return to our country and revisit our kinsfolk. For from this the greatest reason for our desire sprang, because we remembered that our kinsfolk were endowed with such piety and goodness that we felt sure that they would never interfere with our purpose, and we constantly reflected, that we should gain more good out of their earnestness, and should be hampered by no cares about bodily matters, and no trouble in providing food, as they would gladly minister abundantly to the supply of all our wants, and besides this we were feeding our souls on the hope of empty joys, as we thought that we should gain the greatest good from the conversion <a name="fr_2293"></a><a href="#fn_2293"><font size="1">2294</font></a>
  of many, who were to be turned to the way of salvation by our example and instructions. Then besides this the very spot, where was the ancestral possession of our forefathers, and the delightful pleasantness of the neighbourhood was painted before our eyes, how pleasantly and suitably it stretched away to the desert, so that the recesses of the woods would not only delight the heart of a monk, but would also furnish him with a plentiful supply of food. <a name="fr_2294"></a><a href="#fn_2294"><font size="1">2295</font></a>
  And when we explained all this to the aforesaid old man, in a straightforward way, according to the faith of our conscience, and showed by our copious tears that we could no longer resist the violence of the impulse, unless the grace of God came to our rescue by the healing which he could give, he waited for a long time in silence and at last sighed deeply and said:</p>
