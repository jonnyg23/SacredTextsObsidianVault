 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iii.v.xxv-p1"></a>Of the abstinence of one old man who took food six times so sparingly that he was still hungry.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.v.xxv-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.v.xxv-p2.1"></a>When</span> one of the elders was pressing me to eat a little more as I was taking refreshment, and I said that I could not, he replied: “I have already laid my table six times for different brethren who had arrived, and, pressing each of them, I partook of food with him, and am still hungry, and do you, who now partake of refreshment for the first time, say that you cannot eat any more?”</p>
