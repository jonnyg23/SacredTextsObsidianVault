 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iii.ix.xi-p1"></a>How we can decide what is useful and the sorrow according to God, and what is devilish and deadly.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.ix.xi-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.ix.xi-p2.1"></a>But</span> that dejection and sorrow which “worketh repentance steadfast unto salvation” is obedient, civil, humble, kindly, gentle, and patient, as it springs from the love of God, and unweariedly extends itself from desire of perfection to every bodily grief and sorrow of spirit; and somehow or other rejoicing and feeding on hope of its own profit preserves all the gentleness of courtesy and forbearance, as it has in itself all the fruits of the Holy Spirit of which the same Apostle gives the list: “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, goodness, benignity, faith, mildness, modesty.” <a name="fr_961"></a><a href="#fn_961"><font size="1">962</font></a>
  But the other kind is rough, impatient, hard, full of rancour and useless grief and penal despair, and breaks down the man on whom it has fastened, and hinders him from energy and wholesome sorrow, as it is unreasonable, and not only hampers the efficacy of his prayers, but actually destroys all those fruits of the Spirit of which we spoke, which that other sorrow knows how to produce.</p>
