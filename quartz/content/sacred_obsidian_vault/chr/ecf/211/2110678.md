 <p> <a name="iv.iv.vi.xv"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iv.iv.vi.xv-p0.1"></a>Chapter XV.</h4>  
 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iv.vi.xv-p1"></a>How we can do nothing against our faults without the help of God, and how we should not be puffed up by victories over them.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iv.vi.xv-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iv.vi.xv-p2.1"></a>And</span> that we ought not to be puffed up by victories over them he likewise charges us; saying, “Lest after thou hast eaten and art filled, hast built goodly houses and dwelt in them, and shalt have herds of oxen and flocks of sheep, and plenty of gold and of silver, and of all things, thy heart be lifted up and thou remember not the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage; and was thy leader in the great and terrible wilderness.” <a name="fr_1339"></a><a href="#fn_1339"><font size="1">1340</font></a>
  Solomon also says in Proverbs: “When thine enemy shall fall be not glad, and in his ruin be not lifted up, lest the Lord see and it displease Him, and He turn away His wrath from him,” <a name="fr_1340"></a><a href="#fn_1340"><font size="1">1341</font></a>
  i.e., lest He see thy pride of heart, and cease from attacking him, and thou begin to be forsaken by Him and so once more to be troubled by that passion which by Gods grace thou hadst previously overcome. For the prophet would not have prayed in these words, “Deliver not up to beasts, O Lord, the soul that confesseth to Thee,” <a name="fr_1341"></a><a href="#fn_1341"><font size="1">1342</font></a>
  unless he had known that because of their pride of heart some were given over again to those faults which they had overcome, in order that they might be humbled. Wherefore it is well for us both to be certified by actual experience, and also to be instructed by countless passages of Scripture, that we cannot possibly overcome such mighty foes in our own strength, and unless supported by the aid of God alone; and that we ought always to refer the whole of our victory each day to God Himself, as the Lord Himself also gives us instruction by Moses on this very point: “Say not in thine heart when the Lord thy God shall have destroyed them in thy sight: For my  <a name="page_347"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 347</font></a> <a name="iv.iv.vi.xv-Page_347"></a>righteousness hath the Lord brought me in to possess this land, whereas these nations are destroyed for their wickedness. For it is not for thy righteousness, and the uprightness of thine heart, that thou shalt go in to possess their lands: but because they have done wickedly they are destroyed at thy coming in.” <a name="fr_1342"></a><a href="#fn_1342"><font size="1">1343</font></a>
  I ask what could be said clearer in opposition to that impious notion and impertinence of ours, in which we want to ascribe everything that we do to our own free will and our own exertions? “Say not,” he tells us, “in thine heart, when the Lord thy God shall have destroyed them in thy sight: For my righteousness the Lord hath brought me in to possess this land.” To those who have their eyes opened and their ears ready to hearken does not this plainly say: When your struggle with carnal faults has gone well for you, and you see that you are free from the filth of them, and from the fashions of this world, do not be puffed up by the success of the conflict and victory and ascribe it to your own power and wisdom, nor fancy that you have gained the victory over spiritual wickedness and carnal sins through your own exertions and energy, and free will? For there is no doubt that in all this you could not possibly have succeeded, unless you had been fortified and protected by the help of the Lord.</p>
