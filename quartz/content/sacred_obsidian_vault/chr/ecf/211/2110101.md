 <p class="skip"><a name="ii.v.i.i-p1"></a><span class="sc"><a name="ii.v.i.i-p1.1"></a>On</span> reading your letters, my feelings were, in many ways, deeply moved, and I could not refrain from tears. For I both wept for joy because I could perceive from the very language of your letters, that you were living according to the precepts of the Lord God, and out of my exceeding desire after you, I could not help lamenting that, without any fault on my part, I was parted from you; and I would have felt this still more strongly had you not sent me a letter. Should I not, then, enjoy the company of such a sister? But I call your salvation to witness, that I have very often wished to come to you, but have up till now been prevented, through the opposition of him <a name="fr_138"></a><a href="#fn_138"><font size="1">139</font></a>
  who is accustomed to hinder us. For, in my eager desire, I was both urgent to satisfy my wishes by seeing you; and we seemed, if we should meet, likely to accomplish more effectually the work of the Lord, since by comforting one another we should live with the heavy load of this world trodden under our feet. But I do not now fix the day or time of visiting you, because, as often as I have done so, I have not been able to fulfil my purpose. I shall wait on the will of the Lord, and hope that, by my supplications and your prayers, he may bring it about that we reap some advantage from our perseverance. <a name="fr_139"></a><a href="#fn_139"><font size="1">140</font></a>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="ii.v.i.i-p2"></a> It is obvious that, in this whole passage, Sulpitius has in his mind the language of St. Paul, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#009">Rom. i. 9-12</a><a name="ii.v.i.i-p2.1"></a>.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="ii.v.i.i-p3"></a> Halm reads <i>præsentia</i>, instead of the old reading <i>perseverantia</i>`, but apparently without good grounds.</p>
