 <p> <a name="ii.v.ii.viii"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="ii.v.ii.viii-p0.1"></a>Chapter VIII.</h4>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="ii.v.ii.viii-p1"></a><span class="sc"><a name="ii.v.ii.viii-p1.1"></a>Do</span> you flatter yourself on account of the attribute of virginity? Remember Adam and Eve fell when they were virgins, and that the perfect purity of their bodies did not profit them when they sinned. The virgin who sins is to be compared to Eve, and not to Mary. We do not deny that, in the present life, there is the remedy of repentance, but we remind you rather to hope for reward, than to look for pardon. For it is disgraceful that those should ask for indulgence who are expecting the crown of virginity, and that those should commit anything unlawful who have even cut themselves off from things lawful; for it must be remembered that it is lawful to contract an alliance by marriage. And as those are to be praised who, from love to Christ, and for the glory of the kingdom of heaven, have despised the tie of wedlock, so those are to be condemned who, through the pleasure of incontinence, after they have vowed themselves to God, have recourse to the Apostolic remedy. Therefore, as we have said, those who decline marriage despise not things unlawful, but things lawful. And if that class of people swear, if they speak evil of others, if they are detractors, or if they patiently listen to detractors, if they return evil for evil, if they incur the charge of covetousness with respect to other peoples property, or of avarice in regard to their own, if they cherish the poison of revenge or envy, if they either say or think anything unbefitting against the institutions of the law or the Apostles, if with a desire of pleasing in the flesh, they exhibit themselves dressed up and adorned, if they do any other unlawful things, as is only too common, what will it profit them to have spurned what is lawful, while they practice what is not lawful? If you wish it to be of advantage to you, that you have despised things lawful, take care that you do not any of those things which are not lawful. For, it is foolish to have dreaded that which is in its nature less, and not to dread that which is intrinsically more [or not to avoid those things <a name="fr_179"></a><a href="#fn_179"><font size="1">180</font></a>
  which are interdicted,  <a name="page_62"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 62</font></a> <a name="ii.v.ii.viii-Page_62"></a>while such things as are permitted meet with contempt]. For the Apostle says, “She that is unmarried careth for the things of the Lord, how she may please God, that she may be holy both in body and spirit; but she who is married careth for the things of this world, how she may please <a name="fr_180"></a><a href="#fn_180"><font size="1">181</font></a>
  her husband.” He thus affirms that the married woman pleases her husband by thinking of worldly things, while the unmarried woman pleases God, inasmuch as she has no anxiety about the things of the world. Let him tell me, then, whom <i>she</i> desires to please, who has no husband, and yet cares for the things of the world? Shall not the married woman, in such a case, be preferred to her? Yes, since she by caring for the things of the world pleases at least her husband, but the other neither pleases her husband, since she does not have one, nor can she please God. <a name="fr_181"></a><a href="#fn_181"><font size="1">182</font></a>
  But it is not fitting that we should pass over in silence that which he said: “The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, how she may please God, that she may be holy both in body and spirit” [she careth, he says, for the things of the Lord; she does not care for the things of the world, or of men, but for the things of God]. What, then, <i>are</i> the things of the Lord? Let the Apostle tell: “Whatsoever <a name="fr_182"></a><a href="#fn_182"><font size="1">183</font></a>
  things are holy, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report, if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise of doctrine”: these are the things of the Lord, which holy and truly apostolic virgins meditate upon, and think of, day and night, without any interval of time. Of the Lord is the resurrection of the dead, of the Lord is immortality, of the Lord is incorruption, of the Lord is that splendor of the sun which is promised to the saints, as it is written in the Gospel, “Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father”: <a name="fr_183"></a><a href="#fn_183"><font size="1">184</font></a>
  of the Lord are the many mansions of the righteous in the heavens, of the Lord is the fruit which is produced, whether thirty fold, or sixty fold, or an hundred fold. Those virgins who think on these things, and by what works they may be able to merit them, think of the things of the Lord. Of the Lord, too, is the law of the new and old testament, in which shine forth the holy utterances of his lips; and if any virgins meditate without intermission on these things, they think of the things of the Lord. In that case, there is fulfilled in them the saying of the prophet: “The eternal <a name="fr_184"></a><a href="#fn_184"><font size="1">185</font></a>
  foundations are upon a solid rock, and the commands of God are in the heart of the holy woman.”</p>
