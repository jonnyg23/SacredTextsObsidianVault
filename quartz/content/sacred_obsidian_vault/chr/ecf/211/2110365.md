 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iii.iv.xxxvi-p1"></a>How our renunciation of the world is of no use if we are again entangled in those things which we have renounced.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.iv.xxxvi-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.iv.xxxvi-p2.1"></a>Beware</span> therefore lest at any time you take again any of those things which you renounced and forsook, and, contrary to the Lords command, return from the field of evangelical work, and be found to have clothed yourself again in your coat which you had stripped off; <a name="fr_801"></a><a href="#fn_801"><font size="1">802</font></a>
  neither sink back to the low and earthly lusts and desires of this world, and in defiance of Christs word come down from the rod of perfection and dare to take up again any of those things which you have renounced and forsaken. Beware that you remember nothing of your kinsfolk or of your former affections, and that you are not called back to the cares and anxieties of this world, and (as our Lord says) putting your hand to the plough and looking back be found unfit for the kingdom of heaven. <a name="fr_802"></a><a href="#fn_802"><font size="1">803</font></a>
  Beware lest at any time, when you have begun to dip into the knowledge of the Psalms and of this life, you be little by little puffed up and think of reviving that pride which now at your beginning you have trampled under foot in the ardour of faith and in fullest humility; and thus (as the Apostle says) building again those things which you had destroyed, you make yourself a backslider. <a name="fr_803"></a><a href="#fn_803"><font size="1">804</font></a>
  But rather take heed to continue even to the end in that state of nakedness of which you made profession in the sight of God and of his angels. In this humility too and patience, with which you persevered for ten days before the doors and entreated with many tears to be admitted into the monastery, you should not only continue but also increase and go forward. For it is too bad that when you ought to be carried on from the rudiments and beginnings, and go forward to perfection, you should begin to fall back from these to worse things. For not he who begins these things, but he who endures in them to the end, shall be saved. <a name="fr_804"></a><a href="#fn_804"><font size="1">805</font></a>
