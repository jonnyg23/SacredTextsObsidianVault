 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iii.ix.vi-p1"></a>That no one comes to grief by a sudden fall, but is destroyed by falling through a long course of carelessness. <a name="fr_957"></a><a href="#fn_957"><font size="1">958</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.ix.vi-p3"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.ix.vi-p3.1"></a>For</span> no one is ever driven to sin by being provoked through anothers fault, unless he has the fuel of evil stored up in his own heart. Nor should we imagine that a man has been deceived suddenly when he has looked on a woman and fallen into the abyss of shameful lust: but rather that, owing to the opportunity of looking on her, the symptoms of disease which were hidden and concealed in his inmost soul have been brought to the surface.</p>
