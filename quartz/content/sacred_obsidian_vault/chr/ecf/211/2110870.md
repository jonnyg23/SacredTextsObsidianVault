 <p> <a name="iv.v.v.x"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iv.v.v.x-p0.1"></a>Chapter X.</h4>  
 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.v.v.x-p1"></a>How to embrace the system of true knowledge.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.v.v.x-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.v.v.x-p2.1"></a>You</span> must then, if you want to get at the true knowledge of the Scriptures, endeavour  <a name="page_440"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 440</font></a> <a name="iv.v.v.x-Page_440"></a>first to secure steadfast humility of heart, to carry you on by the perfection of love not to the knowledge which puffeth up, but to that which enlightens. For it is an impossibility for an impure mind to gain the gift of spiritual knowledge. And therefore with every possible care avoid this, lest through your zeal for reading there arise in you not the light of knowledge nor the lasting glory which is promised through the light that comes from learning but only the instruments of your destruction from vain arrogance. Next you must by all means strive to get rid of all anxiety and worldly thoughts, and give yourself over assiduously or rather continuously, to sacred reading, until continual meditation fills your heart, and fashions you so to speak after its own likeness, making of it, in a way, an ark of the testimony, <a name="fr_1891"></a><a href="#fn_1891"><font size="1">1892</font></a>
  which has within it two tables of stone, i.e., the constant assurance of the two testaments; <a name="fr_1892"></a><a href="#fn_1892"><font size="1">1893</font></a>
  and a golden pot, i.e., a pure and undefiled memory which preserves by a constant tenacity the manna stored up in it, i.e., the enduring and heavenly sweetness of the spiritual sense and the bread of angels; moreover also the rod of Aaron, i.e., the saving standard of Jesus Christ our true High Priest, that ever buds with the freshness of immortal memory. For this is the rod which after it had been cut from the root of Jesse, died and flourished again with a more vigorous life. But all these are guarded by two Cherubim, i.e., the fulness of historical and spiritual knowledge. For the Cherubim mean a multitude of knowledge: and these continually protect the mercy seat of God, i.e., the peace of your heart, and overshadow it from all the assaults of spiritual wickedness. And so your soul will be carried forward not only to the ark of the Divine Covenant, but also to the priestly kingdom, and owing to its unbroken love of purity being as it were engrossed in spiritual studies, will fulfil the command given to the priests, enjoined as follows by the giver of the Law: “And he shall not go forth from the sanctuary, lest he pollute the Sanctuary of God,” <a name="fr_1893"></a><a href="#fn_1893"><font size="1">1894</font></a>
  i.e., his heart, in which the Lord promised that he would ever dwell, saying: “I will dwell in them and will walk among them.” <a name="fr_1894"></a><a href="#fn_1894"><font size="1">1895</font></a>
  Wherefore the whole series of the Holy Scriptures should be diligently committed to memory and ceaselessly repeated. For this continual meditation will bring us a twofold fruit: first, that while the attention of the mind is taken up in reading and preparing the lessons it cannot possibly be taken captive in any snares of bad thoughts: next that those things which were conned over and frequently repeated and which while we were trying to commit them to memory we could not understand as the mind was at that time taken up, we can afterward see more clearly, when we are free from the distraction of all acts and visions, and especially when we reflect on them in silence in our meditation by night. So that when we are at rest, and as it were plunged in the stupor of sleep, there is revealed to us the understanding of the most secret meanings, of which in our waking hours we had not the remotest conception.</p>
