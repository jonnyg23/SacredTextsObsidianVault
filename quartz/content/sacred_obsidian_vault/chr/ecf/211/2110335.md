 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iii.iv.vi-p1"></a>The reason why the clothes of the renunciants with which they joined the monastery are preserved by the steward.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.iv.vi-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.iv.vi-p2.1"></a>But</span> those clothes, which he laid aside, are consigned to the care of the steward and kept until by different sorts of temptations and trials they can recognize the excellence of his progress and life and endurance. And if they see that he can continue therein as time goes on, and remain in that fervour with which he began, they give them away to the poor. But if they find that he has been guilty of any fault of murmuring, or of even the smallest piece of disobedience, then they strip off from him the dress of the monastery in which he had been clad, and reclothe him in his old garments which had been confiscated, and send him away. <a name="fr_759"></a><a href="#fn_759"><font size="1">760</font></a>
  For it is not right for him to go away with those which he had received, nor do they allow any one to be any longer dressed in them if they have seen him once grow cold in regard to the rule of their institution. Wherefore, also, the opportunity of going out openly is not given to any one, unless he escapes like a runaway slave by taking advantage of the thickest shades of night, or is judged unworthy of this order and profession and lays aside the dress of the monastery and is expelled with shame and disgrace before all the brethren.</p>
