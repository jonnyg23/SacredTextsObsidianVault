 </p><p class="c34"><a name="iv.IV.14-p1"></a><span class="c2"><a name="iv.IV.14-p1.1"></a>Chapter 14.—The Enlargement of Kingdoms is Unsuitably Ascribed to Jove; For If, as They Will Have It, Victoria is a Goddess, She Alone Would Suffice for This Business.</span></p>  
 <p class="c21"><a name="iv.IV.14-p2"></a>Here, first of all, I ask, why even the kingdom itself is not some god.  For why should not it also be so, if Victory is a goddess?  Or what need is there of Jove himself in this affair, if Victory favors and is propitious, and always goes to those whom she wishes to be victorious?  With this goddess favorable and propitious, even if Jove was idle and did nothing, what nations could remain unsubdued, what kingdom would not yield?  But perhaps it is displeasing to good men to fight with most wicked unrighteousness, and provoke with voluntary war neighbors who are peaceable and do no wrong, in order to enlarge a kingdom?  If they feel thus, I entirely approve and praise them.</p>
