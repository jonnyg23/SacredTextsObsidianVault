 <p class="c21"><a name="iv.XV.11-p2"></a>From this discrepancy between the Hebrew books and our own arises the well-known question as to the age of Methuselah; <a name="fr_803"></a><a href="#fn_803"><font size="1">804</font></a>
  for it is computed that he lived for fourteen years after the deluge, though Scripture relates that of all who were then upon the earth only the eight souls in the ark escaped destruction by the flood, and of these Methuselah was not one.  For, according to our books, Methuselah, before he begat the son whom he called Lamech, lived 167 years; then Lamech himself, before his son Noah was born, lived 188 years, which together make 355 years.  Add to these the age of Noah at the date of the deluge, 600 years, and this gives a total of 955 from the birth of Methuselah to the year of the flood.  Now all the years of the life of Methuselah are computed to be 969; for when he had lived 167 years, and had begotten his son Lamech, he then lived after this 802 years, which makes a total, as we said, of 969 years.  From this, if we deduct 955 years from the birth of Methuselah to the flood, there remains fourteen years, which he is supposed to have lived after the flood.  And therefore some suppose that, though he was not on earth (in which it is agreed that every living thing which could not naturally live in water perished), he was for a time with his father, who had been translated, and that he lived there till the flood had passed away.  This hypothesis they adopt, that they may not cast a slight on the trustworthiness of versions which the Church has received into a position of high authority, <a name="fr_804"></a><a href="#fn_804"><font size="1">805</font></a>
  and because they believe that the Jewish <span class="c20"><a name="iv.XV.11-p4.1"></a>mss.</span> rather than our own are in error.  For they do not admit that this is a mistake of the translators, but maintain that there is a falsified statement in the original, from which, through the Greek, the Scripture has been translated into our own tongue.  They say that it is not credible that the seventy translators, who simultaneously and unanimously produced one rendering, could have erred, or, in a case in which no interest of theirs was involved, could have falsified their translation; but that the Jews, envying us our translation of their Law and Prophets, have made alterations in their texts so as to undermine the authority of ours.  This opinion or suspicion let each man adopt according to his own judgment.  Certain it is that Methuselah did not survive the flood, but died in the very year it occurred, if the numbers given in the Hebrew <span class="c20"><a name="iv.XV.11-p4.2"></a>mss.</span> are true.  My own opinion regarding the seventy translators I will, with Gods help, state more carefully in its own place, when I have come down (following the order which this work requires) to that period in which their translation was executed. <a name="fr_805"></a><a href="#fn_805"><font size="1">806</font></a>
   For the present question, it is enough that, according to our versions, the men of that age had lives so long as to make it quite possible that, during the lifetime of the first-born of the two sole parents then on earth, the human race multiplied sufficiently to form a community.</p>
