 <p class="c21"><a name="iv.XX.4-p2"></a>The proofs, then, of this last judgment of God which I propose to adduce shall be drawn first from the New Testament, and then from the Old.  For although the Old Testament is prior in point of time, the New has the precedence in intrinsic value; for the Old acts the part of herald to the New.  We shall therefore first cite passages from the New Testament, and confirm them by quotations from the Old Testament.  The Old contains the law and the prophets, the New the gospel and the apostolic epistles.  Now the apostle says “By the law is the knowledge of sin.  But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets; now the righteousness of God is by faith of Jesus Christ upon all them that believe.” <a name="fr_1320"></a><a href="#fn_1320"><font size="1">1321</font></a>
   This righteousness of God belongs to the New Testament, and evidence for it exists in the old books, that is to say, in the law and the prophets.  I shall first, then state the case, and then call the witnesses.  This order Jesus Christ Himself directs us to observe, saying, “The scribe instructed in the kingdom of God is like a good householder, bringing out of his treasure things new and old.” <a name="fr_1321"></a><a href="#fn_1321"><font size="1">1322</font></a>
   He did not say “old and new,” which He certainly would have said had He not wished to follow the order of merit rather than that of time.</p>
