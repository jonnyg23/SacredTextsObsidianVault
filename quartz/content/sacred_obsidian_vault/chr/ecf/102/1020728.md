 <p class="c21"><a name="v.iv.xxxii-p2"></a>35.  But neither does He use after our fashion of using.  For when we use objects, we do so with a view to the full enjoyment of the goodness of God.  God, however, in His use of us, has reference to His own goodness.  For it is because He is good we exist; and so far as we truly exist we are good.  And, further, because He is also just, we cannot with impunity be evil; and so far as we are evil, so far is our existence less complete.  Now He is the first and supreme existence, who is altogether unchangeable, and who could say in the fullest sense of the words, “I AM <span class="c20"><a name="v.iv.xxxii-p2.1"></a>That</span> I AM,” and “Thou shalt say to them, I AM hath sent me unto you;” <a name="fr_1743"></a><a href="#fn_1743"><font size="1">1744</font></a>
  so that all other things that exist, both owe their existence entirely to Him, and are good only so far as He has given it to them to be so.  That use, then, which God is said to make of us has no reference to His own advantage, but to ours only; and, so far as He is concerned, has reference only to His goodness.  <a name="page_532"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 532</font></a> <a name="v.iv.xxxii-Page_532"></a>  When we take pity upon a man and care for him, it is for his advantage we do so; but somehow or other our own advantage follows by a sort of natural consequence, for God does not leave the mercy we show to him who needs it to go without reward.  Now this is our highest reward, that we should fully enjoy Him, and that all who enjoy Him should enjoy one another in Him.</p>
