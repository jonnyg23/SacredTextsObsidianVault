 <p class="c21"><a name="iv.III.9-p2"></a>It is also believed that it was by the help of the gods that the successor of Romulus, Numa Pompilius, enjoyed peace during his entire reign, and shut the gates of Janus, which are customarily kept open <a name="fr_130"></a><a href="#fn_130"><font size="1">131</font></a>
