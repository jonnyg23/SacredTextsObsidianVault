 <p class="c21"><a name="iv.X.14-p2"></a>The education of the human race, represented by the people of God, has advanced, like that of an individual, through certain epochs, or, as it were, ages, so that it might gradually rise from earthly to heavenly things, and from the visible to the invisible.  This object was kept so clearly in view, that, even in the period when temporal rewards were promised, the one God was presented as the object of worship, that men might not acknowledge any other than the true Creator and Lord of the spirit, even in connection with the earthly blessings of this transitory life.  For he who denies that all things, which either angels or men can give us, are in the hand of the one Almighty, is a madman.  The Platonist Plotinus discourses concerning providence, and, from the beauty of flowers and foliage, proves that from the supreme God, whose beauty is unseen and ineffable, providence reaches down even to these earthly things here below; and he argues that all these frail and perishing things could not have so exquisite and elaborate a beauty, were they not fashioned by Him whose unseen and unchangeable beauty continually pervades all things. <a name="fr_406"></a><a href="#fn_406"><font size="1">407</font></a>
   This is proved also by the Lord Jesus, where He says, “Consider the lilies, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin.  And yet I say unto you that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.  But if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to-day is and to-morrow is cast into the oven, how much more shall He clothe you, O ye of little faith.!” <a name="fr_407"></a><a href="#fn_407"><font size="1">408</font></a>
   It was best, therefore, that the soul of man, which was still weakly desiring earthly things, should be accustomed to seek from God alone even these petty temporal boons, and the earthly necessaries of this transitory life, which are contemptible in comparison with eternal blessings, in order that the desire even of these things might not draw it aside from the worship of Him, to whom we come by despising and forsaking such things.</p>
