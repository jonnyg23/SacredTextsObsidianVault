 <p> <a name="iv.XX.20"></a>  <a name="page_439"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 439</font></a> <a name="iv.XX.20-Page_439"></a>  
 </p><p class="c34"><a name="iv.XX.20-p1"></a><span class="c2"><a name="iv.XX.20-p1.1"></a>Chapter 20.—What the Same Apostle Taught in the First Epistle to the Thessalonians Regarding the Resurrection of the Dead.</span></p>  
 <p class="c21"><a name="iv.XX.20-p2"></a>But the apostle has said nothing here regarding the resurrection of the dead; but in his first Epistle to the Thessalonians he says, “We would not have you to be ignorant brethren, concerning them which are asleep,” <a name="fr_1407"></a><a href="#fn_1407"><font size="1">1408</font></a>
  etc.  These words of the apostle most distinctly proclaim the future resurrection of the dead, when the Lord Christ shall come to judge the quick and the dead.</p>  
 <p class="c21"><a name="iv.XX.20-p4"></a>But it is commonly asked whether those whom our Lord shall find alive upon earth, personated in this passage by the apostle and those who were alive with him, shall never die at all, or shall pass with incomprehensible swiftness through death to immortality in the very moment during which they shall be caught up along with those who rise again to meet the Lord in the air?  For we cannot say that it is impossible that they should both die and revive again while they are carried aloft through the air.  For the words, “And so shall we ever be with the Lord,” are not to be understood as if he meant that we shall always remain in the air with the Lord; for He Himself shall not remain there, but shall only pass through it as He comes.  For we shall go to meet Him as He comes, not where He remains; but “so shall we be with the Lord,” that is, we shall be with Him possessed of immortal bodies wherever we shall be with Him.  We seem compelled to take the words in this sense, and to suppose that those whom the Lord shall find alive upon earth shall in that brief space both suffer death and receive immortality:  for this same apostle says, “In Christ shall all be made alive;” <a name="fr_1408"></a><a href="#fn_1408"><font size="1">1409</font></a>
  while, speaking of the same resurrection of the body, he elsewhere says, “That which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die.” <a name="fr_1409"></a><a href="#fn_1409"><font size="1">1410</font></a>
   How, then, shall those whom Christ shall find alive upon earth be made alive to immortality in Him if they die not, since on this very account it is said, “That which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die?”  Or if we cannot properly speak of human bodies as sown, unless in so far as by dying they do in some sort return to the earth, as also the sentence pronounced by God against the sinning father of the human race runs, “Earth thou art, and unto earth shalt thou return,” <a name="fr_1410"></a><a href="#fn_1410"><font size="1">1411</font></a>
  we must acknowledge that those whom Christ at His coming shall find still in the body are not included in these words of the apostle nor in those of Genesis; for, being caught up into the clouds, they are certainly not sown, neither going nor returning to the earth, whether they experience no death at all or die for a moment in the air.</p>  
 <p class="c21"><a name="iv.XX.20-p8"></a>But, on the other hand, there meets us the saying of the same apostle when he was speaking to the Corinthians about the resurrection of the body, “We shall all rise,” or, as other <span class="c20"><a name="iv.XX.20-p8.1"></a>mss.</span> read, “We shall all sleep.” <a name="fr_1411"></a><a href="#fn_1411"><font size="1">1412</font></a>
   Since, then, there can be no resurrection unless death has preceded, and since we can in this passage understand by sleep nothing else than death, how shall <i> all</i> either sleep or rise again if so many persons whom Christ shall find in the body shall neither sleep nor rise again?  If, then, we believe that the saints who shall be found alive at Christs coming, and shall be caught up to meet Him, shall in that same ascent pass from mortal to immortal bodies, we shall find no difficulty in the words of the apostle, either when he says, “That which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die,” or when he says, “We shall all rise,” or “all sleep,” for not even the saints shall be quickened to immortality unless they first die, however briefly; and consequently they shall not be exempt from resurrection which is preceded by sleep, however brief.  And why should it seem to us incredible that that multitude of bodies should be, as it were, sown in the air, and should in the air forthwith revive immortal and incorruptible, when we believe, on the testimony of the same apostle, that the resurrection shall take place in the twinkling of an eye, and that the dust of bodies long dead shall return with incomprehensible facility and swiftness to those members that are now to live endlessly?  Neither do we suppose that in the case of these saints the sentence, “Earth thou art, and unto earth shalt thou return,” is null, though their bodies do not, on dying, fall to earth, but both die and rise again at once while caught up into the air.  For “Thou shalt return to earth” means, Thou shalt at death return to that which thou wert before life began.  Thou shalt, when examinate, be that which thou wert before thou wast animate.  For it was into a face of earth that God breathed the breath of life when man was made a living soul; as if it were said, Thou art earth with a soul, which thou wast not; thou shalt be earth without a soul, as thou wast.  And this is what all bodies of the dead are before they rot; and what the bodies of those saints shall be if they die, no matter where they die, as soon as they shall give up  <a name="page_440"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 440</font></a> <a name="iv.XX.20-Page_440"></a>  that life which they are immediately to receive back again.  In this way, then, they return or go to earth, inasmuch as from being living men they shall be earth, as that which becomes cinder is said to go to cinder; that which decays, to go to decay; and so of six hundred other things.  But the manner in which this shall take place we can now only feebly conjecture, and shall understand it only when it comes to pass.  For that there shall be a bodily resurrection of the dead when Christ comes to judge quick and dead, we must believe if we would be Christians.  But if we are unable perfectly to comprehend the manner in which it shall take place, our faith is not on this account vain.  Now, however, we ought, as we formerly promised, to show, as far as seems necessary, what the ancient prophetic books predicted concerning this final judgment of God; and I fancy no great time need be spent in discussing and explaining these predictions, if the reader has been careful to avail himself of the help we have already furnished.</p>
