 <p class="c12"><a name="xv.iii.i.xxxii-p2"></a>None of these testimonies, however, sets forth distinctly the Saviours exalted birth; but when the words are addressed to Him, “Thou art My Son, this day have I begotten Thee,” <a name="fr_4607"></a><a href="#fn_4607"><font size="1">4608</font></a>
  this is spoken to Him by God, with whom all time is to-day, for there is no evening with God, as I consider, and there is no morning, nothing but time that stretches out, along with His unbeginning and unseen life.  The day is to-day with Him in which the Son was begotten, and thus the beginning of His birth is not found, as neither is the day of it.</p>
