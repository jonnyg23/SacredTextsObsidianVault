 <p class="c23"><a name="iii.iii-p273"></a>1  Now upon the first <i>day</i> of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain <i>others</i> with them.</p> 
 <p class="c23"><a name="iii.iii-p274"></a>2  And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.</p> 
 <p class="c23"><a name="iii.iii-p275"></a>3  And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.</p> 
 <p class="c23"><a name="iii.iii-p276"></a>4  And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:</p> 
 <p class="c23"><a name="iii.iii-p277"></a>5  And as they were afraid, and bowed down <i>their</i> faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?</p>

 <p class="c23"><a name="iii.iii-p280"></a>1  ¶  The first <i>day</i> of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre,</p> 
 <p class="c23"><a name="iii.iii-p281"></a>and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.</p>

 <p class="c23"><a name="iii.iii-p283"></a>46  Pilate answered and said, I am pure from the blood of the Son of God:  but ye determined this.</p> 
 <p class="c23"><a name="iii.iii-p284"></a>47  Then they all drew near and besought him and entreated him to command the centurion and the soldiers to say nothing of the things which they had seen:  48  For it is better, say they, for us to incur the greatest sin before God, and not to fall into the hands of the people of the Jews and to be stoned.  49  Pilate therefore commanded the centurion and the soldiers to say nothing.</p> 
 <p class="c23"><a name="iii.iii-p285"></a>50  And at dawn upon the Lords day, Mary Magdalen, a disciple of the Lord, fearing because of the Jews, since they were burning with wrath, had not done at the Lords sepulchre the things which the women are wont to do for those that die and for those that are beloved by them—</p> 
 <p class="c23"><a name="iii.iii-p286"></a>51  she took her friends with her and came to the sepulchre where he was laid.</p> 
 <p class="c23"><a name="iii.iii-p287"></a>52  And they feared lest the Jews should see them, and they said, Although on the day on which he was crucified we could not weep and lament, yet now let us do these things at his sepulchre.</p> 
 <p class="c23"><a name="iii.iii-p288"></a>53  But who shall roll away for us the stone that was laid at the door of the sepulchre, that we may enter in and sit by him and do the things that are due?  54  For the stone was great, and we fear lest some one see us.  And if we cannot, yet if we but set at the door the things which we bring for a memorial of him, we will weep and lament, until we come unto our home.</p> 
 <p class="c23"><a name="iii.iii-p289"></a>55  And they went away and found the tomb opened,</p> 
 <p class="c23"><a name="iii.iii-p290"></a>and coming near they looked in there;</p> 
 <p class="c23"><a name="iii.iii-p291"></a>and they see there a certain young man sitting in the midst of the tomb, beautiful and clothed in a robe exceeding bright;</p>

 <p class="c23"><a name="iii.iii-p295"></a>5  And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye:  for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.</p>
