 <p class="c12"><a name="xvi.ii.vi.xxv-p2"></a>And it is possible to apply these words also to our nearest kinsfolk, who are our members, as it were; being considered to be our members, because of the close relationship; whether by birth, or from any habitual friendship, so to speak; whom we must not spare if they are injuring our soul.  For let us cut off from ourselves as a hand or a foot or an eye, a father or mother who wishes us to do that which is contrary to piety, and a son or daughter who, as far as in them lies, would have us revolt from the church of Christ and the love of Him.  But even if the wife of our bosom, or a friend who is kindred in soul, become stumbling-blocks to us, let us not spare them, but let us cut them out from ourselves, and cast them outside of our soul, as not being truly our kindred but enemies of our salvation; for “whosoever hates not his father, and mother,” <a name="fr_5972"></a><a href="#fn_5972"><font size="1">5973</font></a>
  and the others subjoined, when it is the fitting season to hate them as enemies and assailants, that he may be able to win Christ, this man is not worthy of the Son of God.  And in respect of these we may say, that from a critical position any lame one, so to speak, is saved, when he has lost a foot—say a brother—and alone obtains the inheritance of the kingdom of God; and a maimed one is saved, when his father is not saved, but they perish, while he is separated from them, that he alone may obtain the benedictions.  And so also any one is saved with one eye, who <a name="page_490"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 490</font></a> <a name="xvi.ii.vi.xxv-Page_490"></a>has cut out the eye of his own house, his wife, if she commit fornication, lest having two eyes he may go away into the hell of fire.</p>
