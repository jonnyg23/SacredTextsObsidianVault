 </p><p class="c35"><a name="xvi.ii.vi.xxi-p1"></a> <span class="c2"><a name="xvi.ii.vi.xxi-p1.1"></a>21.  The “Woe” Does Not Apply to the Disciples of Jesus.</span></p> 
 <p class="c12"><a name="xvi.ii.vi.xxi-p2"></a>But if there is woe unto men everywhere on the earth, because of occasions of stum<a name="page_488"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 488</font></a> <a name="xvi.ii.vi.xxi-Page_488"></a>bling to those who are laid hold of by them; but the disciples are not of the world, as they do not look at things seen, like as the Master is not of this world; to no one of the disciples of Jesus does the “woe because of occasions of stumbling” apply, since “great peace have they who love the law of God, and there is to them no occasion of stumbling.” <a name="fr_5958"></a><a href="#fn_5958"><font size="1">5959</font></a>
   But if any one seems to be called a disciple, but yet is of the world, because of his loving the world, and the things therein,—I mean, the life in the place round about the earth, and the property in it, or the possessions, or any form of wealth whatsoever,—so that the saying, “they are not of the world,” <a name="fr_5959"></a><a href="#fn_5959"><font size="1">5960</font></a>
  does not fit him; to him, as being really of the world, shall come that which happens to the world, the “woe, because of occasions of stumbling.”  But let him who wishes to avoid this woe not be a lover of life, but let him say with Paul,” “The world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.” <a name="fr_5960"></a><a href="#fn_5960"><font size="1">5961</font></a>
   For the saints while “in the tabernacle, do groan being burdened” <a name="fr_5961"></a><a href="#fn_5961"><font size="1">5962</font></a>
  with “the body of humiliation,” and do all things that they may become worthy to be found in the mystery of the resurrection, when God shall fashion anew the body of humiliation not of all, but of those who have been truly made disciples to Christ, so that it may be conformed to the body of the glory of Christ. <a name="fr_5962"></a><a href="#fn_5962"><font size="1">5963</font></a>
   For as none of the “woes” happen to any of the disciples of Christ, so does not this “woe, because of occasions of stumbling;” for, supposing that thousands of occasions should arise, they shall not touch those who are no longer of the world.  But if any one, because of his faith wanting ballast, and the instability of his submission in regard to the Word of God, is capable of being caused to stumble, let him know that he is not called by Jesus His disciple.  Now we must suppose that so many stumbling-blocks come, that, as a result, the woes extend not to some parts of the earth, but to the whole “world” which is in it.</p>
