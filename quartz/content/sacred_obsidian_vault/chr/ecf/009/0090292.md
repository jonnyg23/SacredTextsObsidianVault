 <p class="c12"><a name="xv.iii.v.xvi-p2"></a>It may not be out of place, as we are examining the text, “I baptize with water,” to compare the parallel utterances of the evangelists with this of John.  Matthew reports that the Baptist, when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, after the words of rebuke which we have already studied, went on: <a name="fr_4906"></a><a href="#fn_4906"><font size="1">4907</font></a>
   “I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance; but He that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear; He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire.”  This agrees with the words in John, in which the Baptist declares himself to those sent by the Pharisees, on the subject of his baptizing with water.  Mark, again, says, <a name="fr_4907"></a><a href="#fn_4907"><font size="1">4908</font></a>
  “John preached, saying, There cometh after me He that is mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.  I baptized you with water, but He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.”  And Luke says <a name="fr_4908"></a><a href="#fn_4908"><font size="1">4909</font></a>
  that, as the people were in expectation, and all were reasoning in their hearts concerning John, whether haply he were the Christ, John answered them all, saying, “I indeed baptize you with water; but there cometh one mightier than I, whose shoe-latchet I am not worthy to unloose; He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire.”</p>
