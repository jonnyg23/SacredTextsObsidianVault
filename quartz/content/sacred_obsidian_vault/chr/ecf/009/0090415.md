 </p><p class="c35"><a name="xvi.ii.v.xviii-p1"></a> <span class="c2"><a name="xvi.ii.v.xviii-p1.1"></a>18.  Jesus Was at First Proclaimed by the Twelve as a Worker and a Teacher Only.</span></p> 
 <p class="c12"><a name="xvi.ii.v.xviii-p2"></a>But he who holds that the things spoken to the Twelve refer to the times subsequent to this, and that the Apostles had not as yet announced to their hearers that He was the Christ, will say that He wished the conception of the Christ which was involved in the name of Jesus to be reserved for that preaching which was more perfect, and which brought salvation, such as Paul knew of when he said to the Corinthians, “I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and Him crucified.” <a name="fr_5677"></a><a href="#fn_5677"><font size="1">5678</font></a>
   Wherefore, formerly they proclaimed Jesus as the doer of certain things, and the teacher of certain things; but now when Peter confesses that He was the Christ, the Son of the living God, as He did not wish it to be proclaimed already that He was the Christ, in order that He might be proclaimed at a more suitable time, and that as crucified, He commands His disciples that they should tell no man that He was the Christ.  And that this was His meaning, when He forbade proclamation to be made that He was the Christ, is in a measure established by the words, “From that time began Jesus to show unto His disciples how that He must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders,” and what is annexed; <a name="fr_5678"></a><a href="#fn_5678"><font size="1">5679</font></a>
  for then, at the fitting time, He proclaims, so to speak, to the disciples who knew that Jesus was Christ, the Son of the living God, the Father having revealed it to them, that instead of believing in Jesus Christ who had been crucified, they were to believe in Jesus Christ who was about to be crucified.  But also, instead of believing in Christ Jesus and Him risen from the dead, He teaches them to believe in Christ Jesus and Him about to be risen from the dead.  But since “having put off from Himself the principalities and the powers, He made a show of them openly, triumphing over in the cross,” <a name="fr_5679"></a><a href="#fn_5679"><font size="1">5680</font></a>
  if any one is ashamed of the cross of Christ, he is ashamed of the dispensation on account of which these powers were triumphed over; and it is fitting that he, who both believes and knows these things, should glory in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, <a name="fr_5680"></a><a href="#fn_5680"><font size="1">5681</font></a>
  through which, when Christ was crucified, the principalities—among which, I think, was also the prince of this world—were made a show of and triumphed over before the believing world.  Wherefore, when His suffering was at hand he said, “Now the prince of this world has been judged,” <a name="fr_5681"></a><a href="#fn_5681"><font size="1">5682</font></a>
  and, “Now shall the prince of this world be cast out,” and, “I, if I be lifted from the earth, will draw all men unto Myself;” <a name="fr_5682"></a><a href="#fn_5682"><font size="1">5683</font></a>
  as he no longer had sufficient power to prevent those going to Jesus who were being drawn by Him.</p>
