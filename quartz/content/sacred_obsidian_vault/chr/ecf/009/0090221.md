 <p class="c12"><a name="xv.iii.i.xxv-p2"></a>Now He is called the light of men and the true light and the light of the word, because He brightens and irradiates the higher parts of men, or, in a word, of all reasonable beings.  And similarly it is from and because of the energy with which He causes the old deadness to be put aside and that which is <i>par excellence</i> life to be put on, so that those who have truly received Him rise again from the dead, that He is called the resurrection.  And this He does not only at the moment at which a man says, <a name="fr_4592"></a><a href="#fn_4592"><font size="1">4593</font></a>
  “We are buried with Christ through baptism and have risen again with Him,” but much rather when a man, having laid off all about him that belongs to death, walks in the newness of life which belongs to Him, the Son, while here.  We always <a name="fr_4593"></a><a href="#fn_4593"><font size="1">4594</font></a>
  “carry about in our body the dying of the Lord Jesus,” and thus we reap the vast advantage, “that the life of the Lord Jesus might be made manifest in our bodies.”</p>
