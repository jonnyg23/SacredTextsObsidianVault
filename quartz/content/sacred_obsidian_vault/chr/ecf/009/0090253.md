 </p><p class="c35"><a name="xv.iii.ii.xiv-p1"></a> <span class="c2"><a name="xv.iii.ii.xiv-p1.1"></a>14.  How the Natures of Men are Not So Fixed from the First, But that They May Pass from Darkness to Light.</span></p> 
 <p class="c12"><a name="xv.iii.ii.xiv-p2"></a>We have been discussing certain things which are opposite, and what has been said of them may serve to suggest what <a name="page_335"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 335</font></a> <a name="xv.iii.ii.xiv-Page_335"></a>has been omitted.  We are speaking of life and the light of men, and the opposite to life is death; the opposite to the light of men, the darkness of men.  It is therefore plain that he who is in the darkness of men is in death, and that he who works the works of death is nowhere but in darkness.  But he who is mindful of God, if we consider what it is to be mindful of Him, is not in death, according to the saying, <a name="fr_4710"></a><a href="#fn_4710"><font size="1">4711</font></a>
  “In death there is no one who remembers Thee.”  Are the darkness of men, and death, such as they are by nature?  On this point we have another passage, <a name="fr_4711"></a><a href="#fn_4711"><font size="1">4712</font></a>
  “We were once darkness, but now light in the Lord,” even if we be now in the fullest sense saints and spiritual persons.  Thus he who was once darkness has become, like Paul, capable of being light in the Lord.  Some consider that some natures are spiritual from the first, such as those of Paul and the holy Apostles; but I scarcely see how to reconcile with such a view, what the above text tells us, that the spiritual person was once darkness and afterwards became light.  For if the spiritual was once darkness what can the earthy have been?  But if it is true that darkness became light, as in the text, how is it unreasonable to suppose that all darkness is capable of becoming light?  Had not Paul said, “We were once in darkness, but now are we light in the Lord,” and thus implied of those whom they consider to be naturally lost, that they were darkness, or are darkness still, the hypothesis about the different natures might have been admissible.  But Paul distinctly says that he had once been darkness but was now light in the Lord, which implies the possibility that darkness should turn into light.  But he who perceives the possibility of a change on each side for the better or for the worse, will not find it hard to gain an insight into every darkness of men, or into that death which consists in the darkness of men.</p>
