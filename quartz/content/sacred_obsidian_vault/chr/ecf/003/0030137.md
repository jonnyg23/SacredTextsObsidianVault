 <p class="c19"><a name="iv.vii.v-p2"></a>Your cruelty is our glory. Only see you to it, that in having such things as these to endure, we do not feel ourselves constrained to rush forth to the combat, if only to prove that we have no dread of them, but on the contrary, even invite their infliction.  When Arrius Antoninus was driving things hard in Asia, the whole Christians of the province, in one united band, presented themselves before his judgment-seat; on which, ordering a few to be led forth to execution, he said to the rest, “O miserable men, if you wish to die, you have precipices or halters.” If we should take it into our heads to do the same thing here, what will you make of so many thousands, of such a multitude of men and women, persons of every sex and every age and every rank, when they present themselves before you?  How many fires, how many swords will be required? What will be the anguish of Carthage itself, which you will have to decimate, <a name="fr_455"></a><a href="#fn_455"><font size="1">456</font></a>
  as each one recognises there his rela<a name="page_108"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 108</font></a> <a name="iv.vii.v-Page_108"></a>tives and companions, as he sees there it may be men of your own order, and noble ladies, and all the leading persons of the city, and either kinsmen or friends of those of your own circle? Spare thyself, if not us poor Christians! Spare Carthage, if not thyself! Spare the province, which the indication of your purpose has subjected to the threats and extortions at once of the soldiers and of private enemies.</p> 
 <p class="c20"><a name="iv.vii.v-p4"></a><i>We</i> have no master but God. <i>He is before</i> you, and cannot be hidden from you, but to Him you can do no injury. But those whom you regard as masters are only men, and one day they themselves must die. Yet still this community will be undying, for be assured that just in the time of its seeming overthrow it is built up into greater power. For all who witness the noble patience of its martyrs, as struck with misgivings, are inflamed with desire to examine into the matter in question; <a name="fr_456"></a><a href="#fn_456"><font size="1">457</font></a>
  and as soon as they come to know the truth, they straightway enrol themselves its disciples.</p>
