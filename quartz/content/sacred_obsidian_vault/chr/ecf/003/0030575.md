 </p><p class="c30"><a name="v.vii.xx-p1"></a> <span class="c1"><a name="v.vii.xx-p1.1"></a>Chapter XX.—Christ Born of a Virgin, of Her Substance. The Physiological Facts of His Real and Exact Birth of a Human Mother, as Suggested by Certain Passages of Scripture.</span></p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="v.vii.xx-p2"></a>But to what shifts you resort, in your attempt to rob the syllable <i>ex</i> (<i>of</i>) <a name="fr_7210"></a><a href="#fn_7210"><font size="1">7211</font></a>
  of its proper force as a preposition, and to substitute another for it in a sense not found throughout the Holy Scriptures!  You say that He was born <i>through</i> <a name="fr_7211"></a><a href="#fn_7211"><font size="1">7212</font></a>
  a virgin, not <i>of</i> <a name="fr_7212"></a><a href="#fn_7212"><font size="1">7213</font></a>
  a virgin, and <i>in</i> a womb, not <i>of</i> a womb, because the angel in the dream said to Joseph, “That which is born in her” (not of her) “is of the Holy Ghost.” <a name="fr_7213"></a><a href="#fn_7213"><font size="1">7214</font></a>
  But the fact is, if he had meant “of her,” he must have said “in her;” for that which was of her, was also in her. The angels expression, therefore, “in her,” has precisely the same meaning as the phrase “of her.” It is, however, a fortunate circumstance that Matthew also, when tracing down the Lords descent from Abraham to Mary, says, “Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, <i>of whom</i> was born Christ.” <a name="fr_7214"></a><a href="#fn_7214"><font size="1">7215</font></a>
  But Paul, too, silences these critics <a name="fr_7215"></a><a href="#fn_7215"><font size="1">7216</font></a>
  when he says, “God sent forth His Son, made of a woman.” <a name="fr_7216"></a><a href="#fn_7216"><font size="1">7217</font></a>
  Does he mean <i>through</i> a woman, or <i>in</i> a woman? Nay more, for the sake of greater emphasis, he uses the word “<i>made</i>” rather than <i>born</i>, although the use of the latter expression would have been simpler.  But by saying “<i>made</i>,” he not only confirmed the statement, “The Word was made flesh,” <a name="fr_7217"></a><a href="#fn_7217"><font size="1">7218</font></a>
  but he also asserted the reality of the flesh which was made of a virgin. We shall have also the support of the Psalms on this point, not the “Psalms” indeed of Valentinus the apostate, and heretic, and Platonist, but the Psalms of David, the most illustrious saint and well-known prophet. He sings to us of Christ, and through his voice Christ indeed also sang concerning Himself. Hear, then, Christ the Lord speaking to God the Father: “Thou art He that didst draw <a name="fr_7218"></a><a href="#fn_7218"><font size="1">7219</font></a>
  me out of my <a name="page_539"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 539</font></a> <a name="v.vii.xx-Page_539"></a>mothers womb.” <a name="fr_7219"></a><a href="#fn_7219"><font size="1">7220</font></a>
  Here is the first point. “Thou art my hope from my mothers breasts; upon Thee have I been cast from the womb.” <a name="fr_7220"></a><a href="#fn_7220"><font size="1">7221</font></a>
  Here is another point. “Thou art my God from my mothers belly.” <a name="fr_7221"></a><a href="#fn_7221"><font size="1">7222</font></a>
  Here is a third point. Now let us carefully attend to the sense of these passages. “Thou didst draw me,” He says, “out of the womb.” Now what is it which is <i>drawn</i>, if it be not that which adheres, that which is firmly fastened to anything from which it is drawn in order to be sundered? If He clove not to the womb, how could He have been drawn from it? If He who clove thereto was drawn from it, how could He have adhered to it, if it were not that, all the while He was in the womb, He was tied to it, as to His origin, <a name="fr_7222"></a><a href="#fn_7222"><font size="1">7223</font></a>
  by the umbilical cord, which communicated growth to Him from the matrix? Even when one strange matter amalgamates with another, it becomes so entirely incorporated <a name="fr_7223"></a><a href="#fn_7223"><font size="1">7224</font></a>
  with that with which it amalgamates, that when it is drawn off from it, it carries with it some part of the body from which it is torn, as if in consequence of the severance of the union and growth which the constituent pieces had communicated to each other.  But what were His “mothers breasts” which He mentions? No doubt they were those which He sucked. Midwives, and doctors, and naturalists, can tell us, from the nature of womens breasts, whether they usually flow at any other time than when the womb is affected with pregnancy, when the veins convey therefrom the blood of the lower parts <a name="fr_7224"></a><a href="#fn_7224"><font size="1">7225</font></a>
  to the <i>mamilla</i>, and in the act of transference convert the secretion into the nutritious <a name="fr_7225"></a><a href="#fn_7225"><font size="1">7226</font></a>
  substance of milk. Whence it comes to pass that during the period of lactation the monthly issues are suspended. But if the Word was made flesh of Himself without any communication with a womb, no mothers womb operating upon Him with its usual function and support, how could the lacteal fountain have been conveyed (from the womb) to the breasts, since (the womb) can only effect the change by actual possession <i>of the proper substance</i>? But it could not possibly have had blood for transformation into milk, unless it possessed the causes of blood also, that is to say, the severance (by birth) <a name="fr_7226"></a><a href="#fn_7226"><font size="1">7227</font></a>
  of its own flesh <i>from the mothers womb</i>. Now it is easy to see what was the novelty of Christs being born of a virgin. It was simply this, that (He was born) of a virgin in the real manner which we have indicated, in order that our regeneration might have virginal purity,—spiritually cleansed from all pollutions through Christ, who was Himself a virgin, even in the flesh, in that He was <i>born</i> of a virgins flesh.</p>
