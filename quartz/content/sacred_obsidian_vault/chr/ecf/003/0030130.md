 <p class="c19"><a name="iv.vi.xv-p2"></a>Keep for God His own property untainted; He will crown it if He choose. Nay, then, He does even choose. He calls us to it. To him who conquers He says, “I will give a crown of life.” <a name="fr_440"></a><a href="#fn_440"><font size="1">441</font></a>
  Be <i>you</i>, too, faithful unto <a name="page_103"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 103</font></a> <a name="iv.vi.xv-Page_103"></a>death, and fight <i>you</i>, too, the good fight, whose crown the apostle <a name="fr_441"></a><a href="#fn_441"><font size="1">442</font></a>
  feels so justly confident has been laid up for him. The angel <a name="fr_442"></a><a href="#fn_442"><font size="1">443</font></a>
  also, as he goes forth on a white horse, conquering and to conquer, receives a crown of victory; and another <a name="fr_443"></a><a href="#fn_443"><font size="1">444</font></a>
  is adorned with an encircling rainbow (as it were in its fair colours)—a celestial meadow. In like manner, the elders sit crowned around, crowned too with a crown of gold, and the Son of Man Himself flashes out above the clouds. If such are the appearances in the vision of the seer, of what sort will be the realities in the actual manifestation?  Look at those crowns. Inhale those odours. Why condemn you to a little chaplet, or a twisted headband, the brow which has been destined for a diadem? For Christ Jesus has made us even kings to God and His Father. What have you in common with the flower which is to die? You have a flower in the Branch of Jesse, upon which the grace of the Divine Spirit in all its fulness rested—a flower undefiled, unfading, everlasting, by choosing which the good soldier, too, has got promotion in the heavenly ranks.  Blush, ye fellow-soldiers of his, henceforth not to be condemned even by him, but by some soldier of Mithras, who, at his initiation in the gloomy cavern, in the camp, it may well be said, of darkness, when at the swords point a crown is presented to him, as though in mimicry of martyrdom, and thereupon put upon his head, is admonished to resist and cast it off, and, if you like, transfer it to his shoulder, saying that Mithras is his crown. And thenceforth he is never crowned; and he has that for a mark to show who he is, if anywhere he be subjected to trial in respect of his religion; and he is at once believed to be a soldier of Mithras if he throws the crown away—if he say that in his god he has his crown. Let us take note of the devices of the devil, who is wont to ape some of Gods things with no other design than, by the faithfulness of his servants, to put us to shame, and to condemn us.</p>
