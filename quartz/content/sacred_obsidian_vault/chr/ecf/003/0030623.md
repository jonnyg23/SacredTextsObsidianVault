 </p><p class="c30"><a name="v.viii.xli-p1"></a> <span class="c1"><a name="v.viii.xli-p1.1"></a>Chapter XLI.—The Dissolution of Our Tabernacle Consistent with the Resurrection of Our Bodies.</span></p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="v.viii.xli-p2"></a>It is still the same sentiment which he follows up in the passage in which he puts the recompense above the sufferings: “for we know;” he says, “that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens;” <a name="fr_7551"></a><a href="#fn_7551"><font size="1">7552</font></a>
  in other words, owing to the fact that our flesh is undergoing dissolution through its sufferings, we shall be provided with a home in heaven. He remembered the award (which the Lord assigns) in the Gospel: “Blessed are they who are persecuted for righteousness sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.” <a name="fr_7552"></a><a href="#fn_7552"><font size="1">7553</font></a>
  Yet, when he thus contrasted the recompense of the reward, he did not deny the fleshs restoration; since the recompense is due to the same substance to which the dissolution is attributed,—that is, of course, the flesh. Because, however, he had called the flesh <i>a house</i>, he wished elegantly to use the same term in his comparison of the ultimate reward; promising to the very house, which undergoes dissolution through suffering, a better house through the resurrection.  Just as the Lord also promises us many mansions as of a house in His Fathers home; <a name="fr_7553"></a><a href="#fn_7553"><font size="1">7554</font></a>
  although this may possibly be understood of the domicile of this world, on the dissolution of whose fabric an eternal abode is promised in heaven, inasmuch as the following context, having a manifest reference to the flesh, seems to show that these preceding words have no such reference. For the apostle makes a distinction, when he goes on to say, “For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven, if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked;” <a name="fr_7554"></a><a href="#fn_7554"><font size="1">7555</font></a>
  which means, before we put off the garment of the flesh, we wish to be clothed with the celestial glory of immortality.  Now the privilege of this favour awaits those who shall at the coming of the Lord be found in the flesh, and who shall, owing to the oppressions of the time of Antichrist, deserve by an instantaneous death, <a name="fr_7555"></a><a href="#fn_7555"><font size="1">7556</font></a>
  which is accomplished by a sudden change, to become qualified to join the rising saints; as he writes to the Thessalonians: “For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God:  and the dead in Christ shall rise first:  then we too shall ourselves be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.” <a name="fr_7556"></a><a href="#fn_7556"><font size="1">7557</font></a>
