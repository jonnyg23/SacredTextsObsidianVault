 <p class="c19"><a name="iv.iv.xvi-p2"></a>Touching the ceremonies, however, of private and social solemnities—as those of the white toga, of espousals, of nuptials, of name-givings—I should think no danger need be guarded against from the breath of the idolatry which is mixed up with them. For the causes are to be considered to which the ceremony is due. Those above-named I take to be clean in themselves, because neither manly garb, nor the marital ring or union, descends from honours done to any idol. In short, I find no dress cursed by God, except a womans dress on a man: <a name="fr_287"></a><a href="#fn_287"><font size="1">288</font></a>
  for “cursed,” saith He, “is every man who clothes himself in womans attire.” The toga, however, is a dress of manly <i>name</i> as well as <i>of manly use</i>. <a name="fr_288"></a><a href="#fn_288"><font size="1">289</font></a>
  God no more prohibits nuptials to be celebrated than a name to be given. “But there are sacrifices appropriated to these occasions.” Let me be invited, and let not the title of the ceremony be “assistance at a sacrifice,” and the discharge of my good offices is at the service <i>of my friends</i>. Would that it were “at <i>their</i> service” indeed, and that we could escape <i>seeing</i> what is unlawful for us to <i>do</i>.  But since the evil one has so surrounded the world with idolatry, it will be lawful for us to be present at some ceremonies which see us doing service to a <i>man</i>, not to an <i>idol</i>.  Clearly, if invited unto priestly function and sacrifice, I will not go, for that is service peculiar to an idol; but neither will I furnish advice, or expense, or any other good office in a matter of <i>that</i> kind. If it is on account of the <i>sacrifice</i> that I be invited, and stand by, I shall be partaker of idolatry; if any <i>other</i> cause conjoins me to the sacrificer, I shall be merely a spectator of the sacrifice. <a name="fr_289"></a><a href="#fn_289"><font size="1">290</font></a>
