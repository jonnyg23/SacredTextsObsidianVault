 </p><p class="c30"><a name="vi.iii.iii-p1"></a> <span class="c1"><a name="vi.iii.iii-p1.1"></a>Chapter III.—Water Chosen as a Vehicle of Divine Operation and Wherefore. Its Prominence First of All in Creation.</span></p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="vi.iii.iii-p2"></a>Mindful of this declaration as of a conclusive prescript, we nevertheless <i>proceed to</i> treat <i>the question</i>, “How <i>foolish</i> and <i>impossible</i> it is to be formed anew by water. In what respect, pray, has this material substance merited an office of so high dignity?” The authority, I suppose, of the liquid element has to be examined. <a name="fr_8550"></a><a href="#fn_8550"><font size="1">8551</font></a>
  This <a name="fr_8551"></a><a href="#fn_8551"><font size="1">8552</font></a>
  however, is found in abundance, and that from the very beginning. For <i>water</i> is one of those things which, before all the furnishing of the world, were quiescent with God in a yet unshapen <a name="fr_8552"></a><a href="#fn_8552"><font size="1">8553</font></a>
  state. “In the first beginning,” saith <i>Scripture</i>, “God made the heaven and the earth. But the earth was invisible, and unorganized, <a name="fr_8553"></a><a href="#fn_8553"><font size="1">8554</font></a>
  and darkness was over the abyss; and the Spirit of the Lord was hovering <a name="fr_8554"></a><a href="#fn_8554"><font size="1">8555</font></a>
  over the waters.” <a name="fr_8555"></a><a href="#fn_8555"><font size="1">8556</font></a>
  The first thing, O man, which you have to venerate, is the <i>age</i> of the waters in that their substance is ancient; the second, their <i>dignity</i>, in that they were the seat of the Divine Spirit, more pleasing <i>to Him</i>, no doubt, than all the other then existing elements. For the darkness was total thus far, shapeless, without the ornament of stars; and the abyss gloomy; and the earth unfurnished; and the heaven unwrought: water <a name="fr_8556"></a><a href="#fn_8556"><font size="1">8557</font></a>
  alone—always a perfect, gladsome, simple material substance, pure in itself—supplied a worthy vehicle to God.  What <i>of the fact</i> that waters were in some way the regulating powers by which the disposition of the world thenceforward was constituted by God?  For the suspension of the celestial firmament in the midst He caused by “dividing the waters;” <a name="fr_8557"></a><a href="#fn_8557"><font size="1">8558</font></a>
  the suspension of “the dry land” He accomplished by “separating the waters.” After the world had been hereupon set in order through <i>its</i> elements, when inhabitants were given it, “the waters” were the first to receive the precept “to bring forth living creatures.” <a name="fr_8558"></a><a href="#fn_8558"><font size="1">8559</font></a>
  Water was the first to produce that which had life, that it might be no wonder in baptism if waters know how to give life. <a name="fr_8559"></a><a href="#fn_8559"><font size="1">8560</font></a>
  For was not the work of fashioning man himself also achieved with the aid of waters?  Suitable material is found in the <i>earth</i>, yet not apt for the purpose unless it be moist and juicy; which (earth) “the waters,” separated the fourth day before into their own place, temper with their remaining moisture to a clayey consistency. If, from that time onward, I go forward in recounting universally, or at more length, the evidences of the “authority” of this element which I can adduce to show how great is its power or its grace; how many ingenious devices, how many functions, how useful an instrumentality, it affords the world, I fear I may seem to have collected rather the praises of water than the reasons of baptism; although I should <i>thereby</i> teach all the more fully, that it is not to be doubted that God has made the material substance which He has disposed throughout all His products <a name="fr_8560"></a><a href="#fn_8560"><font size="1">8561</font></a>
  and works, obey Him also in His own peculiar sacraments; that the <i>material substance</i> which governs terrestrial life acts as agent likewise in the celestial.</p>
