 </p><p class="c30"><a name="vi.ii.iii-p1"></a> <span class="c1"><a name="vi.ii.iii-p1.1"></a>Chapter III.—Sins May Be Divided into Corporeal and Spiritual. Both Equally Subject, If Not to Human, Yet to Divine Investigation and Punishment. <a name="fr_8432"></a><a href="#fn_8432"><font size="1">8433</font></a>
 </span></p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="vi.ii.iii-p3"></a>What things, then, they be for which repentance seems just and due—that is, what things are to be set down under the head of <i>sin</i>—the occasion indeed demands that I should note down; but (to do so) may seem to be unnecessary. For when the Lord is known, our spirit, having been “looked back upon” <a name="fr_8433"></a><a href="#fn_8433"><font size="1">8434</font></a>
  by its own Author, emerges unbidden into the knowledge of the truth; and being admitted to (an acquaintance with) the divine precepts, is by them forthwith instructed that “that from which God bids us abstain is to be accounted <i>sin</i>:”  inasmuch as, since it is generally agreed that God is some great <i>essence</i> of good, of course nothing but evil would be displeasing to good; in that, between things mutually contrary, friendship there is none. Still it will not be irksome briefly to touch upon the fact <a name="fr_8434"></a><a href="#fn_8434"><font size="1">8435</font></a>
  that, of sins, some are carnal, that is, corporeal; some spiritual. For since man is composed of this combination of a two-fold substance, the sources of his sins are no other than the sources of his composition. But it is not the fact that body and spirit are two things that constitute the sins mutually different—otherwise they are on this account rather <i>equal</i>, because the <i>two</i> make up <i>one</i>—lest any make the distinction between their <i>sins</i> proportionate to the difference between their <i>substances</i>, so as to esteem the one lighter, or else heavier, than the other: if it be true, (as it is,) that both flesh and spirit are creatures of God; one wrought by His hand, one consummated by His <i>afflatus</i>. Since, then, they equally pertain to the Lord, whichever of them <i>sins</i> equally <i>offends</i> the Lord. Is it for you to distinguish the acts of the flesh and the spirit, whose communion and conjunction in life, in death, and in resurrection, are <a name="page_659"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 659</font></a> <a name="vi.ii.iii-Page_659"></a>so intimate, that “at that time” <a name="fr_8435"></a><a href="#fn_8435"><font size="1">8436</font></a>
  they are equally raised up either for life or else for judgment; because, to wit, they have equally either sinned or lived innocently? This we would (once for all) premise, in order that we may understand that no less necessity for repentance is incumbent on <i>either</i> part of man, if in anything it have sinned, than on <i>both</i>. The <i>guilt</i> of both is common; common, too, is the <i>Judge</i>—God to wit; common, therefore, is withal the healing medicine of repentance. The source whence sins are named “spiritual” and “corporeal” is the fact that every sin is matter either of <i>act</i> or else of <i>thought</i>: so that what is in <i>deed</i> is “corporeal,” because a <i>deed</i>, like a <i>body</i>, is capable of being <i>seen</i> and <i>touched</i>; what is in the <i>mind</i> is “spiritual,” because <i>spirit</i> is neither <i>seen</i> nor <i>handled</i>: by which consideration is shown that sins not of <i>deed</i> only, but of <i>will</i> too, are to be shunned, and by repentance purged. For if human finitude <a name="fr_8436"></a><a href="#fn_8436"><font size="1">8437</font></a>
  judges only sins of <i>deed</i>, because it is not equal to (piercing) the lurking-places of the <i>will</i>, let us not on that account make light of crimes of the will in Gods sight. God is all-sufficient. Nothing from whence any sin whatsoever proceeds is remote from His sight; because He is neither ignorant, nor does He omit to decree it to judgment. He is no dissembler of, nor double-dealer with, <a name="fr_8437"></a><a href="#fn_8437"><font size="1">8438</font></a>
  His own clear-sightedness. What (shall we say of the fact) that <i>will</i> is the <i>origin</i> of <i>deed</i>? For if any sins are imputed to chance, or to necessity, or to ignorance, let them see to themselves: if these be excepted, there is no sinning save by <i>will</i>. Since, then, will is the origin of deed, is it not so much the rather amenable to penalty as it is first in guilt? Nor, if some difficulty interferes with its full accomplishment, is it even in that case exonerated; for it is itself imputed to itself: nor; having done the work which lay in its own power, will it be excusable by reason of that miscarriage of its accomplishment. In fact, how does the Lord demonstrate Himself as adding a superstructure to the Law, except by interdicting sins of the <i>will</i> as well (as other sins); while He defines not only the man who had actually invaded anothers wedlock to be an adulterer, but likewise him who had contaminated (a woman) by the concupiscence of his gaze? <a name="fr_8438"></a><a href="#fn_8438"><font size="1">8439</font></a>
  Accordingly it is dangerous enough for the mind to set before itself what it is forbidden to perform, and rashly through the will to perfect its execution. And since the power of this will is such that, even without fully sating its self-gratification, it stands for a deed; as a deed, therefore, it shall be punished. It is utterly vain to say, “I <i>willed</i>, but yet I <i>did</i> not.” Rather you <i>ought</i> to carry the thing through, <i>because</i> you will; or else not to will, because you do not carry it through.  But, by the confession of your consciousness, you pronounce your own condemnation. For if you eagerly desired a <i>good</i> thing, you would have been anxious to carry it through; in like manner, as you do not carry an <i>evil</i> thing through, you ought not to have eagerly desired it. Wherever you take your stand, you are fast bound by guilt; because you have either <i>willed</i> evil, or else have not <i>fulfilled</i> good.</p>
