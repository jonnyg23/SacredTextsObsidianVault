 </p><p class="c30"><a name="vi.iv.xxii-p1"></a> <span class="c1"><a name="vi.iv.xxii-p1.1"></a>Chapter XXII.—Answer to the Foregoing Arguments.</span></p> 
 <p class="c19"><a name="vi.iv.xxii-p2"></a>They who make this concession <a name="fr_8873"></a><a href="#fn_8873"><font size="1">8874</font></a>
  ought to reflect on the nature of the word itself—what is the meaning of “woman” from the very first records of the sacred writings. Here they find it to be the <i>name of the sex</i>, not a <i>class of the sex</i>: if, that is, God gave to Eve, when she had not yet known a man, the surname “woman” and “female” <a name="fr_8874"></a><a href="#fn_8874"><font size="1">8875</font></a>
 —(“female,” whereby the sex generally; “woman,” hereby a class of the sex, is marked). <a name="fr_8875"></a><a href="#fn_8875"><font size="1">8876</font></a>
  So, since at that time the as yet unwedded Eve was called by the word “woman,” that word has been made common even to a virgin. <a name="fr_8876"></a><a href="#fn_8876"><font size="1">8877</font></a>
  Nor is it wonderful that the apostle—guided, of course, by the same Spirit by whom, as all the divine Scripture, so that book Genesis, was drawn up—has used the selfsame word in writing “women,” which, by the example of Eve unwedded, is applicable too to a “virgin.” In fact, all the other passages are in consonance herewith. For even by this very fact, that he has not <i>named</i> “virgins” (as he does in another place <a name="fr_8877"></a><a href="#fn_8877"><font size="1">8878</font></a>
  where he is teaching touching marrying), he sufficiently predicates that his remark is made touching <i>every</i> woman, and touching <i>the whole</i> sex; and that there is no distinction made between a “virgin” <i>and any other</i>, while he does not name her at all. For he who elsewhere—namely, where the difference requires—remembers to make the distinction, (moreover, he makes it by designating each species by their appropriate names,) wishes, where he makes <i>no</i> distinction (while he does not name each), <i>no</i> difference to be understood. What of the fact that in the Greek speech, in which the apostle wrote his letters, it is usual to say, “women” rather than “females;” that is, <span class="Greek"><a name="vi.iv.xxii-p7.2"></a>γυναῖκας</span> <a name="page_688"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 688</font></a> <a name="vi.iv.xxii-Page_688"></a>(<i>gunaikas</i>) rather than <span class="Greek"><a name="vi.iv.xxii-p7.3"></a>θηλείας</span> (<i>theleias</i>)? Therefore if that word, <a name="fr_8878"></a><a href="#fn_8878"><font size="1">8879</font></a>
  which by interpretation represents what “female” (<i>femina</i>) represents, <a name="fr_8879"></a><a href="#fn_8879"><font size="1">8880</font></a>
  is frequently used <i>instead</i> of the name of the sex, <a name="fr_8880"></a><a href="#fn_8880"><font size="1">8881</font></a>
  he has named the <i>sex</i> in saying <span class="Greek"><a name="vi.iv.xxii-p10.2"></a>γυναῖκα</span>; but in the <i>sex</i> even the <i>virgin</i> is embraced. But, withal, the declaration is plain: “<i>Every</i> woman,” saith he, “praying and prophesying with head uncovered, <a name="fr_8881"></a><a href="#fn_8881"><font size="1">8882</font></a>
  dishonoureth her own head.” <a name="fr_8882"></a><a href="#fn_8882"><font size="1">8883</font></a>
  What is “<i>every</i> woman,” but <i>woman</i> of every age, of every rank, of every condition? By saying “every” he excepts nought of womanhood, just as he excepts nought of manhood either from <i>not</i> being covered; for just so he says, “<i>Every man</i>.” <a name="fr_8883"></a><a href="#fn_8883"><font size="1">8884</font></a>
  As, then, in the masculine sex, under the name of “man” even the “youth” is <i>forbidden</i> to be veiled; so, too, in the feminine, under the name of “woman,” even the “virgin” is <i>bidden</i> to be veiled. Equally in each sex let the younger age follow the discipline of the elder; or else let the male “virgins,” <a name="fr_8884"></a><a href="#fn_8884"><font size="1">8885</font></a>
  too, be <i>veiled</i>, if the female virgins withal are <i>not</i> veiled, because <i>they</i> are not mentioned by <i>name</i>.  Let “man” and “youth” be different, if “woman” and “virgin” are different. For indeed it is “on account of the angels” <a name="fr_8885"></a><a href="#fn_8885"><font size="1">8886</font></a>
  that he saith women must be veiled, because on account of “the daughters of men” angels revolted from God. <a name="fr_8886"></a><a href="#fn_8886"><font size="1">8887</font></a>
  Who then, would contend that “<i>women</i>” <i>alone</i>—that is, <a name="fr_8887"></a><a href="#fn_8887"><font size="1">8888</font></a>
  such as were already wedded and had lost their virginity—were the objects of angelic concupiscence, unless “virgins” are incapable of excelling in beauty and finding lovers? Nay, let us see whether it were not <i>virgins alone</i> whom they lusted after; since Scriptures saith “<i>the daughters</i> of men;” <a name="fr_8888"></a><a href="#fn_8888"><font size="1">8889</font></a>
  inasmuch as it might have named “<i>wives</i> of men,” or “females,” indifferently. <a name="fr_8889"></a><a href="#fn_8889"><font size="1">8890</font></a>
  Likewise, in that it saith, “And they took them to themselves for wives,” <a name="fr_8890"></a><a href="#fn_8890"><font size="1">8891</font></a>
  it does so on this ground, that, of course, such are “received <i>for wives</i>” as are devoid of that title. But it would have expressed itself differently concerning such as were <i>not</i> thus devoid. And so (they who are named) are devoid as much of <i>widowhood</i> as of <i>virginity</i>. So completely has <i>Paul</i> by naming the sex generally, mingled “daughters” and species together in the genus. Again, while he says that “nature herself,” <a name="fr_8891"></a><a href="#fn_8891"><font size="1">8892</font></a>
  which has assigned hair as a tegument and ornament to women, “teaches that veiling is the duty of females,” has not the same tegument and the same honour of the head been assigned also to virgins?  If “it is shameful” for a woman to be shorn it is similarly so to a virgin too. From them, then, to whom is assigned one and the same <i>law</i> of the head, <a name="fr_8892"></a><a href="#fn_8892"><font size="1">8893</font></a>
  one and the same <i>discipline</i> <a name="fr_8893"></a><a href="#fn_8893"><font size="1">8894</font></a>
  of the head is exacted,—(which extends) even unto those virgins whom their childhood defends, <a name="fr_8894"></a><a href="#fn_8894"><font size="1">8895</font></a>
  for from the first <a name="fr_8895"></a><a href="#fn_8895"><font size="1">8896</font></a>
  <i>a virgin</i> was named “female.” This custom, <a name="fr_8896"></a><a href="#fn_8896"><font size="1">8897</font></a>
  in short, even Israel observes; but if <i>Israel</i> did <i>not</i> observe it, <i>our</i> Law, <a name="fr_8897"></a><a href="#fn_8897"><font size="1">8898</font></a>
  amplified and supplemented, would vindicate the addition for itself; let it be excused for imposing the veil on virgins also.  Under <i>our</i> dispensation, let that age which is ignorant of its sex <a name="fr_8898"></a><a href="#fn_8898"><font size="1">8899</font></a>
  retain the privilege of simplicity. For both Eve and Adam, when it befell them to be “wise,” <a name="fr_8899"></a><a href="#fn_8899"><font size="1">8900</font></a>
  forthwith veiled what they had learnt to know. <a name="fr_8900"></a><a href="#fn_8900"><font size="1">8901</font></a>
  At all events, with regard to those in whom girlhood has changed (into maturity), their age ought to remember its duties as to nature, so also, to discipline; for they are being transferred to the rank of “women” both in their persons and in their functions. No one is a “virgin” from the time when she is capable of marriage; seeing that, in her, age has by that time been wedded to its own husband, that is, to time. <a name="fr_8901"></a><a href="#fn_8901"><font size="1">8902</font></a>
  “But some particular <i>virgin</i> has devoted herself to God.  From that very moment she both changes the fashion of her hair, and converts all her garb into that of a woman.”  Let her, then, maintain the character wholly, and perform the whole function of a “virgin:” what she conceals <a name="fr_8902"></a><a href="#fn_8902"><font size="1">8903</font></a>
  for the sake of God, let her cover quite over. <a name="fr_8903"></a><a href="#fn_8903"><font size="1">8904</font></a>
  It is our business to entrust to the knowledge of God alone that which the grace of God effects in us, lest we receive from man the reward we hope for from God. <a name="fr_8904"></a><a href="#fn_8904"><font size="1">8905</font></a>
  Why do you denude before God <a name="fr_8905"></a><a href="#fn_8905"><font size="1">8906</font></a>
  what you cover <a name="page_689"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 689</font></a> <a name="vi.iv.xxii-Page_689"></a>before men? <a name="fr_8906"></a><a href="#fn_8906"><font size="1">8907</font></a>
  Will you be more modest in public than in the church? If <i>your self-devotion</i> is a grace of God, and you have received it, “why do you boast,” saith he, “as if you have not received it?” <a name="fr_8907"></a><a href="#fn_8907"><font size="1">8908</font></a>
  Why, by your ostentation of yourself, do you judge others? Is it that, by your boasting, you invite others unto good?  Nay, but even you yourself run the risk of losing, if you boast; and you drive others unto the same perils! What is assumed from love of boasting is easily destroyed. Be veiled, virgin, if virgin you are; for you ought to blush. If you are a virgin, shrink from (the gaze of) many eyes. Let no one wonder at your face; let no one perceive your falsehood. <a name="fr_8908"></a><a href="#fn_8908"><font size="1">8909</font></a>
  You do well in falsely assuming the married character, if you veil your head; nay, you do not seem to assume it <i>falsely</i>, for you <i>are</i> wedded to Christ: to Him you have surrendered your body; act as becomes your Husbands discipline. If He bids the brides of others to be veiled, His own, of course, much more. “But each individual man <a name="fr_8909"></a><a href="#fn_8909"><font size="1">8910</font></a>
  is not to think that the institution of his predecessor is to be overturned.” Many yield up their own judgment, and its consistency, to the custom of others. Granted that <i>virgins</i> be not <i>compelled</i> to be veiled, at all events such as <i>voluntarily are</i> so should not be prohibited; who, likewise, cannot deny themselves to be virgins, <a name="fr_8910"></a><a href="#fn_8910"><font size="1">8911</font></a>
  content, in the security of a good conscience before God, to damage their own fame. <a name="fr_8911"></a><a href="#fn_8911"><font size="1">8912</font></a>
  Touching such, however, as are betrothed, I can with constancy “above my small measure” <a name="fr_8912"></a><a href="#fn_8912"><font size="1">8913</font></a>
  pronounce and attest that they are to be veiled from that day forth on which they shuddered at the first bodily touch of a man by kiss and hand. For in them everything has been forewedded: their age, through maturity; their flesh, through age; their spirit, through consciousness; their modesty, through the experience of the kiss their hope, through expectation; their mind through volition. And Rebecca is example enough for us, who, when her betrothed had been pointed out, veiled herself for marriage merely on recognition of him. <a name="fr_8913"></a><a href="#fn_8913"><font size="1">8914</font></a>
