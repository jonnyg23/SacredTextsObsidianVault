 <sup>87 </sup>Hippolytus, having exposed the system of sidereal influence over men, proceeds to detail the magical rites and operations of the sorcerers. This arrangement is in conformity with the technical divisions of astrology into (1) judiciary, (2) natural. The former related to the prediction of future events, and the latter of the phenomena of nature, being thus akin to the art of magic.</p>

 <sup>92 </sup>The Abbe Cruice considers that this passage, as attributing all this jugglery to the artifice of sorcerers, militates against the authorship of Origen, who ascribes (<font face="SPIonic"> Heri Arxwn</font>, lib. iii. p. 144, ed. Benedict.) the same results not to the frauds of magicians, but to demons. </p>

 <sup>95 </sup>On the margin of the MS., we find the words, "concerning coals," "concerning magical signs," "concerning sheep."</p>

 <sup>97 </sup>Or, "close up."</p>

 <sup>98 </sup>The words "death of a goat" occur on the margin of the MS.</p>

 <sup>99 </sup>A similar statement is made, on the authority of Alcmaeon, by Aristotle in his <i>Histor. Animal.</i>, i. 2.</p>

 <sup>100 </sup><font face="SPIonic">Mannh</font> is the word in the text. But manna in the ordinary acceptation of the tenn can scarcely be intended. Pliny, however, mentions it as a proper name of grains of incense and resin. The Abbe Cruice suggests the very probable emendation of <font face="SPIonic">malqh</font>, which signifies a mixture of wax and resin for caulking ships. </p>

 <sup>101 </sup><font face="SPIonic">diaulon</font> in the text has been altered into <font face="SPIonic">kelanon</font>. The trans- ~ lator has followed the latter.</p>

 <sup>103 </sup>Marsilius Ficinus (in his <i>Commentary on Plotinrus</i>, p. 504 et sec., vol. ii. Creuzer's edition), who here discusses the subject of demons and magical art, mentions, on the authority of Porphyry, that sorcerers had the power of evoking demons, and that a magician, in the presience of many, had shown to Plotinus his guardian demon (angel). This constitutes the Goetic department of magic.</p>

 <sup>105 </sup><font face="SPIonic"> Mursinh</font> This word is evidently not the right one, for we have (<font face="SPIonic"> smurnh</font>) myrrh mentioned. Perhaps the word <font face="SPIonic">malqh</font>, suggested in a previous passage, is the one employed here likewise.</p>
 
 <p><a name="P756_188865"></a>
 <sup>106 </sup>Or, "makes speedy preparation;" or, "resorts to the contrivance of."</p>

 <sup>107 </sup>The words in italics are added by the Abbe Cruice. There is obviously some hiatus in the original.</p>

 <sup>110 </sup>Or, "exposed their method of proceeding in accordance with the system of Gnosticism." Schneidewin, following C. Fr. Hermann, is of opinion that what follows is taken from Celsus' work on magic, to which Origen alludes in the <i>Contra Celsum</i>, lib. i. p.53 (Spencer's edition). Lucian (the well-known satirist), in his <i>Alexander</i>, or <i>Pseudomiantis</i>, gives an account of the jugglery of these magicians. See: note, chap. xlii. of this book. </p>

 <sup>114 </sup>This sentence is obviously out of place, and should properly come in probably before the words, "These contrivances, however, I hesitated to narrate," etc., a few lines above in this chapter. The Abbe Cruice conjectures that it may have been written on the margin by some reader acquainted with chemistry, and thatafterwards it found its way into the text.</p>

 <sup>116 </sup>What cyanus was is not exactly known. It was employed in the Homeric age for the adornment of implements of war. Whatever the nature of the substance be, it was of a dark-blue colour. Some suppose it to have been blue steel, other, blue copper. Theophrastus' account of it makes it a stone like a dark sapphire.</p>

 <sup>120 </sup>Or, "suspending a drum, etc., covered with," etc.; or "frequently placing on an elevated position a drum." For <font face="SPIonic">porrwqen</font>, which is not here easy of explanation, some read <font face="SPIonic">tornwqen</font>, others <font face="SPIonic">!porpwqen</font>, i.e, fastened with buckles; others, <font face="SPIonic">porrw teqen</font>.</p>

 <sup>121 </sup>Schneidewin, but not the Abbe Cruice, thinks there is a hiatus here.</p>

 <sup>122 </sup>There are diferent readings: (1) <font face="SPIonic">etumololikhj</font>; (2) <font face="SPIonic">eti oloklhrou</font>; (3) <font face="SPIonic">ualourgikhj</font>, i e., composed of glass. (See next note.)</p>

 <sup>123 </sup>The Abbe Cruice properly remarks that this has no meaning here. He would read <font face="SPIonic">ualwdesi topoij</font>, or by means of glass images.</p>
