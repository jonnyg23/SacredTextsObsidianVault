 </p><p class="c46"><a name="xviii.iii.xxiv-p1"></a> <span class="c2"><a name="xviii.iii.xxiv-p1.1"></a>Chapter 24.—He Concludes that the Apostle Spoke in His Own Person, and that of Those Who are Under Grace.</span></p>  
 <p><a name="xviii.iii.xxiv-p2"></a>On the careful consideration of these things, and things of the same kind in the context of that apostolical Scripture, the apostle is rightly understood to have signified not, indeed, himself alone in his own person, but others also established under grace, and with him not yet established in that perfect peace in which death shall be swallowed up in victory. <a name="fr_2585"></a><a href="#fn_2585"><font size="1">2586</font></a>
  And concerning this he afterwards says, “But if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is life because of righteousness. If, then, the Spirit of Him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwelleth in you, He that raised up Jesus from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by His Spirit that dwelleth in you.” <a name="fr_2586"></a><a href="#fn_2586"><font size="1">2587</font></a>
  Therefore, after our mortal bodies have been quickened, not only will there be no consent to sinning, but even the lust of the flesh itself, to which there is no consent, will not remain. And not to have this resistance to the spirit in the mortal flesh, was possible only to that man who came not by the flesh to men. And that the apostles, because they were men, and carried about in the mortality of this life a body which is corrupted and weighs down the soul,   <a name="fr_2587"></a><a href="#fn_2587"><font size="1">2588</font></a>
  were, therefore, “always polluted with excessive lust,” as that man injuriously affirms, be it far from me to say. But I do say that although they were free from consent to depraved lusts, they nevertheless groaned concerning the concupiscence of the flesh, which they bridled by restraint with such humility and piety, that they desired rather not to have it than to subdue it.</p>
