 <p><a name="xxi.iii.ix-p2"></a>The fourth petition is, “Give us this day our daily bread,” <a name="fr_3569"></a><a href="#fn_3569"><font size="1">3570</font></a>
  where the blessed Cyprian shows how here also perseverance is understood to be asked for. Because he says, among other things, “And we ask that this bread should be given to us daily, that we who are in Christ, and daily receive the Eucharist for the food of salvation, may not by the interposition of some heinous sin be separated from Christs body by being withheld from communicating and prevented from partaking of the heavenly bread.” <a name="fr_3570"></a><a href="#fn_3570"><font size="1">3571</font></a>
  These words of the holy man of God indicate that the saints ask for perseverance directly from God, when with this intention they say, “Give us this day our daily bread,” that they may not be separated from Christs body, but may continue in that holiness in which they allow no crime by which they may deserve to be separated from it.</p>
