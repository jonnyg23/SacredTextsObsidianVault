 <p><a name="xvi.vi.iii-p2"></a>The paper which I now answer starts with this title: “<i>Headings out of a book written by Augustin, in reply to which I have culled a few passages out of books</i>.” I perceive from this that the person who forwarded these written papers to your Excellency wanted to make his extracts out of the books he does not name, with a view, so far as I can judge, to getting a quicker answer, in order that he might not delay your urgency. Now, after considering what books they were which he meant, I suppose that it must have been those which Julianus mentioned in the Epistle he sent to Rome, <a name="fr_2193"></a><a href="#fn_2193"><font size="1">2194</font></a>
  a copy of which found its way to me at the same time. For he there says: “They go so far as to allege that marriage, now in dispute, was not instituted by God,—a declaration which may be read in a work of Augustins, to which I have lately replied in a treatise of four books.” These are the books, as I believe, from which the extracts were taken. It would, then, have been perhaps the better course if I had set myself deliberately to disprove and refute that entire work of his, <a name="fr_2194"></a><a href="#fn_2194"><font size="1">2195</font></a>
  which he spread out into four volumes. But I was most unwilling to delay my answer, even as you yourself lost no time in forwarding to me the written statements which I was requested to reply to.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="xvi.vi.iii-p4"></a> This Augustin afterwards did by the publication of six book against Julianus, on receiving his entire work. Augustin tells us (<i>Unfinished Work</i>, i. 19) that he had long endeavoured to procure a copy of Julianus books for the purpose of refuting them, and only succeeded in getting them after some difficulty and delay.</p>
