 <p><a name="xiv.xvii-p2"></a>After the judges had accorded their approbation to this answer of Pelagius, another passage which he had written in his book was read aloud: “The kingdom of heaven was promised even in the Old Testament.” Upon this, Pelagius remarked in vindication: “This can be proved by the Scriptures: but heretics, in order to disparage the Old Testament, deny this.

High.” <a name="fr_1641"></a><a href="#fn_1641"><font size="1">1642</font></a>
