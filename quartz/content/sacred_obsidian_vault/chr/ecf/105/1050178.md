 <p><a name="xi.v-p2"></a>Here, perhaps, you will say to me in answer, that the things which I have instanced as not having been realized, although capable of realization, are <i>divine</i> works; whereas a mans being without sin falls in the range of a mans own work,—that being indeed his very noblest work which effects a full and perfect righteousness complete in every part; and therefore that it is incredible that no man has ever existed, or is existing, or will exist in this life, who has achieved such a work, if the achievement is possible for a human being. But then you ought to reflect that, although this great work, no doubt, belongs to human agency to accomplish, yet it is also a divine gift, and therefore, not doubt that it is a divine work; “for it is God who worketh in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure.” <a name="fr_717"></a><a href="#fn_717"><font size="1">718</font></a>
