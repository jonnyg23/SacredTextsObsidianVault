 <p><a name="xvi.vi.viii-p2"></a>Let us now look at those words of ours which he adduced just as it suited him, and to which he would oppose his own. For they are followed by his words; moreover, as the person insinuated who sent you the paper of extracts, he copied something out of a preface, which was no doubt the preface of the books from which he selected a few passages. The paragraph thus copied stands as follows: “The teachers of our day, most holy brother, <a name="fr_2201"></a><a href="#fn_2201"><font size="1">2202</font></a>
  who are the instigators of the disgraceful faction which is now overheated with its zeal, are determined on compassing the injury and discredit of the men with whose sacred fervour they are set on fire, by nothing less than the ruin of the whole Church; little thinking how much honour they have conferred on those whose renown they have shown to be only capable of being destroyed along with the catholic religion. For, if one should say, either that there is free will in man, or that God is the Creator of those that are born, <a name="fr_2202"></a><a href="#fn_2202"><font size="1">2203</font></a>
  he is at once set down as a Cœlestian and a Pelagian. To avoid being called heretics, they turn Manicheans; and so, whilst shirking a pretended infamy, they incur a real reproach; just like the animals, which in hunting they surround with dyed feathers, in order to scare and drive them into their nets; <a name="fr_2203"></a><a href="#fn_2203"><font size="1">2204</font></a>
  the poor brutes are not gifted with reason, and so they are thrust all together by a vain panic into a real destruction.” <a name="fr_2204"></a><a href="#fn_2204"><font size="1">2205</font></a>
