 <p><a name="xiv.lxvii-p2"></a>Of the opinions which Cœlestius has said or written, and which were objected against Pelagius, on the ground that they were the dogmas of his disciple, he acknowledged some as entertained also by himself; but, in his vindication, he said that he held them in a different sense from that which was alleged in the indictment. One of these opinions was thus stated: “Before the advent of Christ some men lived holy and righteous lives.” <a name="fr_1772"></a><a href="#fn_1772"><font size="1">1773</font></a>
  Cœlestius, however, was stated to have said that “they lived <i> sinless</i> lives.” Again, it was objected that Cœlestius declared “the Church to be without spot and wrinkle.” <a name="fr_1773"></a><a href="#fn_1773"><font size="1">1774</font></a>
  Pelagius, however, said in his reply, “that he had made such an assertion, but as meaning that the Church is by the laver cleansed from every spot and wrinkle, and that in this purity the Lord would have her continue.” Respecting that statement <a name="page_211"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 211</font></a> <a name="xiv.lxvii-Page_211"></a>of Cœlestius: “That we do more than is commanded us in the law and the gospel,” Pelagius urged in his own vindication, <a name="fr_1774"></a><a href="#fn_1774"><font size="1">1775</font></a>
  that “he spoke concerning virginity,” of which Paul says: “I have no commandment of the Lord.” <a name="fr_1775"></a><a href="#fn_1775"><font size="1">1776</font></a>
  Another objection alleged that Cœlestius had maintained that “every individual has the ability to possess all powers and graces,” thus annulling that “diversity of gifts” which, the apostle sets forth. <a name="fr_1776"></a><a href="#fn_1776"><font size="1">1777</font></a>
  Pelagius, however, answered, that “he did not annul the diversity of gifts, but declared that God gives to the man who has proved himself worthy to receive them, all graces, even as He gave the Apostle Paul.”</p>
