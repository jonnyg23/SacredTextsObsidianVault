 <p><a name="xx.xvi-p2"></a>Whosoever, then, are made to differ from that original condemnation by such bounty of divine <a name="page_477"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 477</font></a> <a name="xx.xvi-Page_477"></a>grace, there is no doubt but that for such it is provided that they should hear the gospel, and when they hear they believe, and in the faith which worketh by love they persevere unto the end; and if, perchance, they deviate from the way, when they are rebuked they are amended and some of them, although they may not be rebuked by men, return into the path which they had left; and some who have received grace in any age whatever are withdrawn from the perils of this life by swiftness of death. For He worketh all these things in them who made them vessels of mercy, who also elected them in His Son before the foundation of the world by the election of grace: “And if by grace, then is it no more of works, otherwise grace is no more grace.” <a name="fr_3290"></a><a href="#fn_3290"><font size="1">3291</font></a>
  For they were not so called as not to be elected, in respect of which it is said, “For many are called but few are elected;” <a name="fr_3291"></a><a href="#fn_3291"><font size="1">3292</font></a>
  but because they were called according to the purpose, they are of a certainty also elected by the election, as it is said, of grace, not of any precedent merits of theirs, because to them grace is all merit.</p>
