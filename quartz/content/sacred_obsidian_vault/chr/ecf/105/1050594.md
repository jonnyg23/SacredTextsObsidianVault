 <p><a name="xvi.v.xxix-p2"></a>In the case, then, of those persons who are born again in Christ, when they receive an entire remission of all their sins, it is of course necessary that the guilt also of the still indwelling concupiscence should be remitted, in order that (as I said) it should not be imputed to them for sin. For even as in the case of those sins which cannot be themselves permanent, since they pass away as soon as they are committed, the guilt yet is permanent, and (if not remitted) will remain for evermore; so, when the concupiscence is remitted, the guilt of it also is taken away. For not to have sin means this, not to be deemed guilty of sin. If a man have (for example) committed adultery, though he do not repeat the sin, he is held to be guilty of adultery until the indulgence in guilt be itself remitted. He has the sin, therefore, remaining, although the particular act of his sin no longer exists, since it has passed away along with the time when it was committed. For if to desist from sinning were the same thing as not to have sins, it would be sufficient if Scripture were content to give us the simple warning, “My son, hast thou sinned? Do so no more.” <a name="fr_2155"></a><a href="#fn_2155"><font size="1">2156</font></a>
  This, however, does not suffice, for it goes on to say, “Ask forgiveness for thy former sins.” <a name="fr_2156"></a><a href="#fn_2156"><font size="1">2157</font></a>
  Sins remain, therefore, if they are not forgiven. But how do they remain if they are passed away? Only thus, they have passed away in their <i>act</i>, but they are permanent in their <i>guilt</i>. Contrari<a name="page_276"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 276</font></a> <a name="xvi.v.xxix-Page_276"></a>wise, then, may it happen that a thing may remain in act, but pass away in guilt.</p>
