 <p><a name="xii.vii-p2"></a>Mans nature, indeed, was created at first faultless and without any sin; but that nature of man in which every one is born from Adam, now wants the Physician, because it is not sound. All good qualities, no doubt, which it still possesses in its make, life, senses, intellect, it has of the Most High God, its Creator and Maker. But the flaw, which darkens and weakens all those natural goods, so that it has need of illumination and healing, it has not contracted from its blameless Creator—but from that original sin, which it committed by free will. Accordingly, criminal nature has its part in most righteous punishment. For, if we are now newly created in Christ, <a name="fr_1136"></a><a href="#fn_1136"><font size="1">1137</font></a>
  we were, for all that, children of wrath, even as others, <a name="fr_1137"></a><a href="#fn_1137"><font size="1">1138</font></a>
  “but God, who is rich in mercy, for His great love wherewith He loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, by whose grace we were saved.” <a name="fr_1138"></a><a href="#fn_1138"><font size="1">1139</font></a>
