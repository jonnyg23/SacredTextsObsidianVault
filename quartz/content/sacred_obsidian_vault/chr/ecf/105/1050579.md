 <p><a name="xvi.v.xiv-p2"></a>Now this propagation of children which among the ancient saints was a most bounden duty for the purpose of begetting and preserving a people for God, amongst whom the prophecy of Christs coming must needs have had precedence over everything, now has no longer the same necessity. For from among all nations the way is open for an abundant offspring to receive spiritual regeneration, from whatever quarter they derive their natural birth. So that we may acknowledge that the scripture which says there is “a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing,” <a name="fr_2109"></a><a href="#fn_2109"><font size="1">2110</font></a>
  is to be distributed in its clauses to the periods before Christ and since. The former was the time to embrace, the latter to refrain from embracing.</p>
