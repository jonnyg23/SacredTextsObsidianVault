 <p><a name="xv.iii.xlvi-p2"></a>Such are the particulars which, to the best of my ability, I have succeeded in obtaining from the writings of Pelagius, whenever he makes mention of grace. You perceive, however, that men who entertain such opinions as we have reviewed are “ignorant of Gods righteousness, and desire to establish their own,” <a name="fr_1892"></a><a href="#fn_1892"><font size="1">1893</font></a>
  and are far off from “the righteousness which we have of God” <a name="fr_1893"></a><a href="#fn_1893"><font size="1">1894</font></a>
  and not of ourselves; and this they ought to have discovered and recognised in the very holy canonical Scriptures. Forasmuch, however, as they read these Scriptures in a sense of their own, they of course fail to observe even the most obvious truths therein. Would that they would but turn their attention in no careless mood to what might be learned concerning the help of Gods grace in the writings, at all events, of catholic authors; for they freely allow that the Scriptures were correctly understood by these, and that they would not pass them by in neglect, out of an overweening fondness for their own opinions. For note how this very man Pelagius, in that very treatise of his so recently put forth, and which he formally mentions in his self-defence (that is to say, in the third book of his <i>Defence of Free Will</i>), praises St. Ambrose.</p>
