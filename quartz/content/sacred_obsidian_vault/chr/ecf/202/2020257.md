 <p class="c24"><a name="ii.x.xl-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="ii.x.xl-p2.1"></a>Maximian</span>, having peacefully governed the church during two years and five months, died on the 12th of April, in the consulate of Areobindus and Aspar. <a name="fr_1027"></a><a href="#fn_1027"><font size="1">1028</font></a>
   This happened to be on the fifth day of the week of fasts which immediately precedes Easter. The day of the week was Thursday. Then the Emperor Theodosius wishing to prevent the disturbances in the church which usually attend the election of a bishop, made a wise provision for this affair; for in order that there might be no dispute again about the choice of a bishop and tumult thus arise, without delaying, before the body of Maximian was interred, he directed the bishops who were then in the city to place Proclus in the episcopal chair. For he had received already letters from Cælestinus bishop of Rome approving of this election, which he had forwarded to Cyril of Alexandria, John of Antioch, and Rufus of Thessalonica; in which he assured them that there was no impediment to the translation to another see, of a person who had been nominated and really was the bishop of some one church. Proclus, being thus invested with the bishopric, performed the funeral obsequies of Maximian: but it is now time briefly to give some account of him also. </p>
