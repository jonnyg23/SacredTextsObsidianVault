Concerning those who were sent by him to make Trial of the Matter. The Death of John Chrysostom</i>.</p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="iii.xiii.xxviii-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iii.xiii.xxviii-p2.1"></a>Innocent</span>, bishop of Rome, was very anxious, as appears by his former letter, to procure the recall of John. <a name="fr_1619"></a><a href="#fn_1619"><font size="1">1620</font></a>
    <a name="fr_1620"></a><a href="#fn_1620"><font size="1">1621</font></a>
   He sent five bishops and two presbyters of the Roman church, with the bishops who had been delegated as ambassadors to him from the East, to the emperors Honorius <a name="page_418"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 418</font></a> <a name="iii.xiii.xxviii-Page_418"></a>and Arcadius, to request the convocation of a council, and solicit them to name time and place. The enemies of John at Constantinople framed a charge as though these things were done to insult the Eastern emperor, and caused the ambassadors to be ignominiously dismissed as if they had invaded a foreign government. John was at the same time condemned by an imperial edict to a remoter place of banishment, and soldiers were sent to conduct him to Pityus; the soldiers were soon on hand, and effected the removal. It is said that during this journey, Basiliscus, the martyr, appeared to him at Comani, in Armenia, and apprised him of the day of his death. Being attacked with pain in the head, and being unable to bear the heat of the sun, he could not prosecute his journey, but closed his life in that town. </p>
