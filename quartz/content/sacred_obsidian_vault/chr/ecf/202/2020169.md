 </p><p class="c32"><a name="ii.viii.v-p1"></a><span class="c11"><a name="ii.viii.v-p1.1"></a>Chapter IV</span>.—<i>The Macedonians, who had subscribed the Homoousian Doctrine, return to their Former Error.</i></p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="ii.viii.v-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="ii.viii.v-p2.1"></a>After</span> the deputation from the Macedonians to Liberius, that sect was admitted to entire communion with the churches in every city, intermixing themselves indiscriminately with those who from the beginning had embraced the form of faith published at Nicæa. But when the law of the Emperor Gratian permitted the several sects to reunite without restraint in the public services of religion, they again resolved to separate themselves; and having met at Antioch in Syria, they decided to avoid the word <i>homoousios</i> again, and in no way to hold communion with the supporters of the Nicene Creed. They however derived no advantage from this attempt; for the majority of their own party being disgusted at the fickleness with which they sometimes maintained one opinion, and then another, withdrew from them, and thenceforward became firm adherents of those who professed the doctrine of the <i>homoousion.</i> <a name="fr_686"></a><a href="#fn_686"><font size="1">687</font></a>
