 <p class="c24"><a name="ii.vi.xi-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="ii.vi.xi-p2.1"></a>Although</span> at the beginning of his reign the Emperor Julian conducted himself mildly toward <a name="page_85"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 85</font></a> <a name="ii.vi.xi-Page_85"></a>all men; but as he went on he did not continue to show the same equanimity. He most readily indeed acceded to the requests of the Christians, when they tended in any way to cast odium on the memory of Constantius; but when this inducement did not exist, he made no effort to conceal the rancorous feelings which he entertained towards Christians in general. Accordingly he soon ordered that the church of the Novatians at Cyzicus, which Euzoïus had totally demolished, should be rebuilt, imposing a very heavy penalty upon Eleusius bishop of that city, if he failed to complete that structure at his own expense within the space of two months. Moreover, he favored the pagan superstitions with the whole weight of his authority: and the temples of the heathen were opened, as we have before stated; <a name="fr_514"></a><a href="#fn_514"><font size="1">515</font></a>
   but he himself also publicly offered sacrifices to Fortune, goddess of Constantinople, in the cathedral, <a name="fr_515"></a><a href="#fn_515"><font size="1">516</font></a>
   where her image was erected. </p>

The Theodosian cathedral was situated in the seventh ward.</p>
