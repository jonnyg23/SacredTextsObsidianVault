 <p class="c7"><a name="ii.iii.iv-p2"></a>A. <i>Uses made before the First Printed Edition of the Greek Text.</i></p>  
 <p class="c25"><a name="ii.iii.iv-p3"></a><span class="c11"><a name="ii.iii.iv-p3.1"></a>Socrates</span> <i>Ecclesiastical History</i> was used, according to the best authorities, by Sozomen in the composition of his parallel history. <a name="fr_102"></a><a href="#fn_102"><font size="1">103</font></a>
   It was certainly used by Liberatus, the Carthaginian deacon, in his <i>Breviarium caussæ Nestorianorum et Eutychianorum</i>, and by Theodorus Anagnostes (Lector) in his <i>Ecclesiastical History</i>. <a name="fr_103"></a><a href="#fn_103"><font size="1">104</font></a>
   It was also quoted in the second Council of Nicæa, under the name of Rufinus, and also under its authors name. <a name="fr_104"></a><a href="#fn_104"><font size="1">105</font></a>
   </p>   
 <p class="c25"><a name="ii.iii.iv-p7"></a>Epiphanius, surnamed Scholasticus, translated the history of Socrates, together with those of Sozomen and Theodoret, under the auspices of Cassiodorus, about the beginning of the sixth century. This translation, under the name of <i>Historiæ Ecclesiasticæ Tripartitæ</i>, consists of twelve books, and was printed at Paris, without date, by Regnault in 8vo; afterwards also at Bâle in 1523, 1528, 1533, 1539, and 1568. It was revised by <span class="c13"><a name="ii.iii.iv-p7.1"></a>Beatus Rhenanus</span>, and published in Frankfort on the Main in 1588, together with the history of Eusebius, which was translated and continued by Rufinus. It is also found in the new edition of Cassiodorus printed at Rouen by <span class="c13"><a name="ii.iii.iv-p7.2"></a>Jo</span>. <span class="c13"><a name="ii.iii.iv-p7.3"></a>Garetius</span> in 1679 and in Venice, 1729. It served as a basis for a French translation by <span class="c13"><a name="ii.iii.iv-p7.4"></a>Ægidius Gourlinus</span> (Gille Gourlin), published in Paris in 1538 (cited by <span class="c13"><a name="ii.iii.iv-p7.5"></a>Cyaneus</span>), and of a German translation by <span class="c13"><a name="ii.iii.iv-p7.6"></a>Caspar Hedio</span> at Strasburg, 1545.</p>  
 <p class="c29"><a name="ii.iii.iv-p8"></a>B. <i>Editions.</i></p>  
 <p class="c25"><a name="ii.iii.iv-p9"></a>There are two independent editions of Socrates <i>Ecclesiastical History</i>, each of which has served as a basis for reprints, secondary editions, and translations. These are:</p>  
 <p class="c25"><a name="ii.iii.iv-p10"></a><span class="c11"><a name="ii.iii.iv-p10.1"></a>I. Eusebii Pamphili</span>: <i>Hist. EccI.</i> LL. X.; ejd. <i>de Vita Constantini</i> LL. V.; <span class="c13"><a name="ii.iii.iv-p10.2"></a>Socratis</span> <i>Hist. Eccl.</i> LL. VII.; <span class="c13"><a name="ii.iii.iv-p10.3"></a>Theodoreti</span> Episc. Cyrensis <i>Hist. EccI.</i> LL. V.; <i>Collectaneum ex hist. eccl.</i> <span class="c13"><a name="ii.iii.iv-p10.4"></a>Theodori Lectoris</span> LL. II.; <span class="c13"><a name="ii.iii.iv-p10.5"></a>Hermiæ Sozomeni</span> <i>Hist. EccI.</i> LL. IX.; <span class="c13"><a name="ii.iii.iv-p10.6"></a>Evagrii</span> <i>Hist. Eccl.</i> LL. VI. Lut. Paris, ex off. Rob. Stephani 1544 pridie Cal. Jul.</p>  
 <p class="c25"><a name="ii.iii.iv-p11"></a>a. Upon this edition is based a Latin translation by <span class="c13"><a name="ii.iii.iv-p11.1"></a>Wolfgang Musculus</span>, Bâle 1544, 1549, 1557, 1594, and one by <span class="c13"><a name="ii.iii.iv-p11.2"></a>J. J. Christophorson</span>, bishop of Chichester, Paris 1571, Cologne 1581, Bâle 1570; with notes by <span class="c13"><a name="ii.iii.iv-p11.3"></a>Grynæus</span> and by <span class="c13"><a name="ii.iii.iv-p11.4"></a>Henricus Petri 1611</span>; incorporated into the <i>Bibliotheca Patrum,</i> ed. Cologne 1618 as Vol. V. and ed. Lyons 1677 as Vol. VII.</p>  
 <p class="c25"><a name="ii.iii.iv-p12"></a>b. The Greek text of Stephens and the Latin translation of Christophorson were published together in Geneva, 1612.</p>  
 <p class="c25"><a name="ii.iii.iv-p13"></a>c. An English translation of Socrates Ecclesiastical History was made by <span class="c13"><a name="ii.iii.iv-p13.1"></a>Meredith Hanmer</span>, <a name="fr_105"></a><a href="#fn_105"><font size="1">106</font></a>
   and is contained in his <i>Ancient Ecclesiastical Histories of the first six hundred years after Christ, written in the Greek tongue by three learned Historiographers, Eusebius, Socrates and Evagrius.</i> London 1577. [This work also contains Dorotheus <i>Lives of the Prophets, Apostles, and Seventy Disciples</i> reprinted in 1585 and 1650.] </p>   
 <p class="c25"><a name="ii.iii.iv-p15"></a>2. The second independent edition of Socrates is that which has been received as standard and served as a basis for all subsequent uses, viz.:</p>  
 <p class="c25"><a name="ii.iii.iv-p16"></a><i>Historia Ecclesiastica Socratis, Scholastici, Hermiæ, Sozomeni,</i> &amp;c., ed. <span class="c13"><a name="ii.iii.iv-p16.1"></a>Henricus Valesius</span>. Paris 1668. Valesius ostensibly revised the text of Stephens, but as a matter of fact he made a new collation of the <span class="c13"><a name="ii.iii.iv-p16.2"></a>ms.</span> used by Stephens, and compared this with <span class="c13"><a name="ii.iii.iv-p16.3"></a>mss.</span> in the Vatican, so that <a name="page_xix"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. xix</font></a> <a name="ii.iii.iv-Page_xix"></a>his edition amounts to an entirely new work. He also made a new Latin translation and appended numerous notes. This edition was reprinted in Mayence in 1677. Its Latin portion was reprinted in Paris also in 1677. The reprint of Mayence was reproduced under a new title, as if in Amsterdam in 1675.</p>  
 <p class="c25"><a name="ii.iii.iv-p17"></a>a. <span class="c13"><a name="ii.iii.iv-p17.1"></a>Gul. Reading</span> appended additional notes, and together with the Latin translation of Valesius, published the work in Cambridge in three vols. 1720. Readings edition was reprinted at Turin in 1746. Valesius original edition was again reprinted in Oxford by <span class="c13"><a name="ii.iii.iv-p17.2"></a>Parker</span> in 1844 and <i>Cura</i> <span class="c13"><a name="ii.iii.iv-p17.3"></a>Buckley</span> in London, also in 1844. It was revised and published in Oxford in 3 vols. by <span class="c13"><a name="ii.iii.iv-p17.4"></a>R. Hussey</span> in 1853, and again in 1860 and in 1879. Again it was incorporated into <span class="c13"><a name="ii.iii.iv-p17.5"></a>Mignes</span> <i>Patrologia Græca</i> as Vol. LXVII. (Petit Montrouge) in 1859, and finally the Greek text alone was revised and published in a single volume by <span class="c13"><a name="ii.iii.iv-p17.6"></a>William Bright</span> in Oxford 1878.</p>  
 <p class="c25"><a name="ii.iii.iv-p18"></a>b. The translations based on Valesius edition exclusive of those in Latin mentioned above are as follows:</p>  
 <p class="c25"><a name="ii.iii.iv-p19"></a>In <i>French</i> by <span class="c13"><a name="ii.iii.iv-p19.1"></a>L.

The translation of Socrates is anonymous, but generally ascribed to Walford also. This cannot be a matter of inference from the appearance of the two historians in the same series, as Eusebius, also in the same series, is translated by Crusè. Those who attribute the translation to Walford give no reason for doing so.</p>
