 <p class="c24"><a name="ii.x.xxvi-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="ii.x.xxvi-p2.1"></a>After</span> the decease of Atticus, there arose a strong contest about the election of a successor, some proposing one person, and some another. One party, they say, was urgent in favor of a presbyter named Philip; another wished to promote Proclus who was also a presbyter; but the general desire of the people was that the bishopric should be conferred on Sisinnius. This person was also a presbyter but held no ecclesiastical office within the city, having been appointed to the sacred ministry in a church at Elæa, a village in the suburbs of Constantinople. This village is situated across the harbor from the city, and in it from an ancient custom the whole population annually assembled for the celebration of our Saviours ascension. All of the laity were warmly attached to the man because he was famous for his piety, and especially because he was diligent in the care of the poor even beyond his power. <a name="fr_985"></a><a href="#fn_985"><font size="1">986</font></a>
   The earnestness of the laity thus prevailed, and Sisinnius was ordained on the twenty-eighth day of February, under the following consulate, which was the twelfth of Theodosius, and the second of Valentinian. <a name="fr_986"></a><a href="#fn_986"><font size="1">987</font></a>
   The presbyter Philip was so chagrined at the preference of another to himself, that he even introduced the subject into his <i>Christian History</i>, <a name="fr_987"></a><a href="#fn_987"><font size="1">988</font></a>
   making some very censorious remarks, both about the person ordained and those who had ordained him, and much more severely on the laity. But he said such things as I cannot by any means commit to writing. Since I do not approve of his unadvised action in committing them to writing, I do not deem it unseasonable, however, to give some notice here of him and of his works. </p>
