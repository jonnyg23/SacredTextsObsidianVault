 <p class="c24"><a name="ii.v.xxix-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="ii.v.xxix-p2.1"></a>During</span> this time Photinus, <a name="fr_353"></a><a href="#fn_353"><font size="1">354</font></a>
   who then presided over the church in that city more openly avowed the creed he had devised; wherefore a tumult being made in consequence, the emperor ordered a Synod of bishops to be held at Sirmium. There were accordingly convened there of the Oriental bishops, <a name="fr_354"></a><a href="#fn_354"><font size="1">355</font></a>
   Mark of Arethusa, George of Alexandria, whom the Arians sent, as I have before said, having placed him over that see on the removal of Gregory, Basil who presided over the church at Ancyra after Marcellus was ejected, Pancratius of Pelusium, and Hypatian of Heraclea. Of the Western bishops there were present Valens of Mursa, and the then celebrated Hosius of Cordova in Spain, who attended much against his will. These met at Sirmium, after the consulate of Sergius and Nigrinian, <a name="fr_355"></a><a href="#fn_355"><font size="1">356</font></a>
   in which year no consul celebrated the customary inaugural <a name="fr_356"></a><a href="#fn_356"><font size="1">357</font></a>
   solemnities, in consequence of the tumults of war; and having met and found that Photinus held the heresy of Sabellius the Libyan, and Paul of Samosata, they immediately deposed him. This decision was both at that time and afterwards universally commended as honorable and just; but those who continued there, subsequently acted in a way which was by no means so generally approved. </p>
