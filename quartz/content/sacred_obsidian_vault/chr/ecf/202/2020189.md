 <p class="c24"><a name="ii.viii.xxv-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="ii.viii.xxv-p2.1"></a>But</span> neither did the followers of Eunomius remain without dissensions: for Eunomius <a name="fr_806"></a><a href="#fn_806"><font size="1">807</font></a>
   himself had long before this separated from Eudoxius who ordained him bishop of Cyzicus, taking occasion from that bishops refusal to restore to communion his master Aëtius who had been ejected. But those who derived their name from him were subsequently divided into several factions. For first Theophronius a Cappadocian, who had been instructed in the art of disputation by Eunomius, and had acquired a smat<a name="page_135"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 135</font></a> <a name="ii.viii.xxv-Page_135"></a>tering of Aristotles <i>Categories,</i> and his <i>Book of Interpretation,</i> composed some treatises which he entitled, <i>On the Exercise of the Mind.</i> Having, however, drawn down upon himself the reprobation of his own sect, he was ejected as an apostate. He afterwards held assemblies apart from them, and left behind him a heresy which bore his own name. Furthermore at Constantinople a certain Eutychius from some absurd dispute, withdrew from the Eunomians, and still continues to hold separate meetings. The followers of Theophronius are denominated Eunomiotheophronians; and those of Eutychius have the appellation of Eunomieutychians. What those nonsensical terms were about which they differed I consider unworthy of being recorded in this history, lest I should go into matters foreign to my purpose. I shall merely observe that they adulterated baptism: for they do not baptize in the name of the Trinity, but into the death of Christ. <a name="fr_807"></a><a href="#fn_807"><font size="1">808</font></a>
   Among the Macedonians also there was for some time a division, when Eutropius a presbyter held separate assemblies, and Carterius did not agree with him. There are possibly in other cities sects which have emanated from these: but living at Constantinople, where I was born and educated, I describe more particularly what has taken place in that city; both because I have myself witnessed some of these transactions, and also because the events which have there occurred are of pre-eminent importance, and are therefore more worth of commemoration. Let it however be understood that what I have here related happened at different periods, and not at the same time. But if any one should be desirous of knowing the names of the various sects, he may easily satisfy himself, by reading a book entitled <i>Ancoratus</i>, <a name="fr_808"></a><a href="#fn_808"><font size="1">809</font></a>
   composed by Epiphanius, bishop of Cyprus: but I shall content myself with what I have already stated. The public affairs were again thrown into agitation from a cause I shall now refer to. </p>
