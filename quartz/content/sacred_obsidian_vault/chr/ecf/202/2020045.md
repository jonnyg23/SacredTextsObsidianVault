 </p><p class="c32"><a name="ii.iv.xxxvi-p1"></a><span class="c11"><a name="ii.iv.xxxvi-p1.1"></a>Chapter XXXVI</span>.—<i>Of Marcellus Bishop of Ancyra, and Asterius the Sophist.</i></p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="ii.iv.xxxvi-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="ii.iv.xxxvi-p2.1"></a>The</span> bishops assembled at Constantinople deposed also Marcellus bishop of Ancyra, a city of Galatia Minor, on this account. A certain rhetorician of Cappadocia named Asterius having abandoned his art, and professed himself a convert to Christianity, undertook the composition of some treatises, which are still extant, in which he commended the dogmas of Arius; asserting that Christ is the power of God, in the same sense as the locust and the palmer-worm are said by Moses to be the power of God, <a name="fr_252"></a><a href="#fn_252"><font size="1">253</font></a>
   with other similar utterances. Now Asterius was in constant association with the bishops, and especially with those of their number who did not discountenance the Arian doctrine: he also attended their Synods, in the hope of insinuating himself into the bishopric of some city: but he failed to obtain ordination, in consequence of having sacrificed during the persecution. <a name="fr_253"></a><a href="#fn_253"><font size="1">254</font></a>
   Going therefore throughout the cities of Syria, he read in public the books which he had composed. Marcellus being informed of this, and wishing to counteract his influence, in his over-anxiety to confute him, fell into the diametrically opposite error; for he dared to say, as the Samosatene <a name="fr_254"></a><a href="#fn_254"><font size="1">255</font></a>
   had done, that Christ was a mere man. When the bishops then convened at Jerusalem had intelligence of these things, they took no notice of Asterius, because he was not enrolled even in the catalogue of ordained priests; but they insisted that Marcellus, as a priest, should give an account of the book which he had written. Finding that he entertained Paul of Samosatas sentiments, they required him to retract his <a name="page_34"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 34</font></a> <a name="ii.iv.xxxvi-Page_34"></a>opinion; and he being thoroughly ashamed of himself, promised to burn his book. But the convention of bishops being hastily dissolved by the emperors summoning them to Constantinople, the Eusebians on their arrival at that city, again took the case of Marcellus into consideration; and as Marcellus refused to fulfil his promise of burning his untimely book, those present deposed him, and sent Basil into Ancyra in his stead. Moreover Eusebius wrote a refutation of this work in three books, in which he exposed its erroneous doctrine. Marcellus however was afterwards reinstated <a name="fr_255"></a><a href="#fn_255"><font size="1">256</font></a>
   in his bishopric by the Synod at Sardica, on his assurance that his book had been misunderstood, and that on that account he was supposed to favor the Samosatenes views. But of this we shall speak more fully in its proper place. </p>

One of the consequences of lapsing was disqualification for high office in the church. See Neander, <i>Hist. of Christ. Ch.</i> Vol. I. p. 226 seq.</p>
