 </p><p class="c32"><a name="ii.x.vi-p1"></a><span class="c11"><a name="ii.x.vi-p1.1"></a>Chapter VI</span>.—<i>The Leaders of Arianism at this Time.</i></p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="ii.x.vi-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="ii.x.vi-p2.1"></a>Dorotheus</span> bishop of the Arians, who, as we have said, <a name="fr_915"></a><a href="#fn_915"><font size="1">916</font></a>
   was translated by that sect from Antioch to Constantinople, having attained the age of one hundred and nineteen years, died on the 6th of November, in the seventh consulate of Honorius, and the second of Theodosius Augustus. <a name="fr_916"></a><a href="#fn_916"><font size="1">917</font></a>
   After him Barbas presided over the Arian sect, in whose time the Arian faction was favored by possessing two very eloquent members, both having the rank of presbyter, one of whom was named Timothy, and the other George. Now George excelled in Grecian literature; Timothy, on the other hand, was proficient in the sacred Scriptures. George indeed constantly had the writings of Aristotle and Plato in his hands: Timothy found his inspiration in Origen; he also evinced in his public expositions of the holy Scriptures no inconsiderable acquaintance with the Hebrew language. Now Timothy had formerly identified himself with the sect of the Psathyrians; <a name="fr_917"></a><a href="#fn_917"><font size="1">918</font></a>
   but George had been ordained by Barbas. I have myself conversed with Timothy, and was exceedingly struck by the readiness with which he would answer the most difficult questions, and clear up the most obscure passages in the Divine oracles; he also invariably quoted Origen as an unquestionable authority in confirmation of his own utterances. But it is astonishing to me that these two men should continue to uphold the heresy of the Arians; the one being so conversant with Plato, and the other having Origen so frequently on his lips. For Plato does not say that the second and third cause, as he usually terms them, had a beginning of existence: <a name="fr_918"></a><a href="#fn_918"><font size="1">919</font></a>
   and Origen everywhere acknowledges the Son to be co-eternal <a name="fr_919"></a><a href="#fn_919"><font size="1">920</font></a>
   with the Father. Nevertheless although they remained connected with their own church, still they unconsciously changed the Arian sect for the better, and displaced many of the blasphemies of Arius by their own teachings. But enough of these persons. Sisinnius bishop of the Novatians dying under the same consulate, Chrysanthus was ordained in his place, of whom we shall have to speak by and by. </p>
