 </p><p class="c32"><a name="ii.vii.xxii-p1"></a><span class="c11"><a name="ii.vii.xxii-p1.1"></a>Chapter XXII</span>.—<i>Silence of Sabinus on the Misdeeds of the Arians; Flight of Peter to Rome; Massacre of the Solitaries at the Instigation of the Arians.</i></p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="ii.vii.xxii-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="ii.vii.xxii-p2.1"></a>Of</span> the outrages perpetrated upon the installation of Lucius, and the treatment of those who were ejected, both in the courts and outside of the courts, and how some were subjected to a variety of tortures, and others sent into exile even after this excruciating process, Sabinus takes not the slightest notice. In fact, being half disposed <a name="page_106"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 106</font></a> <a name="ii.vii.xxii-Page_106"></a>to Arianism himself, he purposely veils the atrocities of his friends. Peter, however, has exposed them, in the letters he addressed to all the churches, when he had escaped from prison. For this [bishop] having managed to escape from prison, fled to Damasus, bishop of Rome. The Arians though not very numerous, becoming thus possessed of the Alexandrian churches soon after obtained an imperial edict directing the governor of Egypt to expel not only from Alexandria but even out of the country, the favorers of the homoousian doctrine, and all such as were obnoxious to Lucius. After this they assailed and disturbed and terribly harassed the monastic institutions in the desert; armed men rushed in the most ferocious manner upon those who were utterly defenceless, and who would not lift an arm to repel their violence: so that numbers of unresisting victims were in this manner slaughtered with a degree of wanton cruelty beyond description.</p>
