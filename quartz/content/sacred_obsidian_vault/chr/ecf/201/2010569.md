 <p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.iii.l-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.iii.l-p2.1"></a>Having</span> thus embellished the city which bore his name, he next distinguished the capital of Bithynia <a name="fr_3282"></a><a href="#fn_3282"><font size="1">3283</font></a>
  by the erection of a stately and magnificent church, being desirous of raising in this city also, in honor of his Saviour and at his own charges, a memorial of his victory over his own enemies and the adversaries of God. He also decorated the principal cities of the other provinces with sacred edifices of great beauty; as, for example, in the case of that metropolis of the East which derived its name from Antiochus, in which, as the head of that portion of the empire, he consecrated to the service of God a church of unparalleled size and beauty. The entire building was encompassed by an enclosure of great extent, within which the church itself rose to a vast elevation, being of an octagonal form, and surrounded on all sides by <a name="page_533"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 533</font></a> <a name="iv.vi.iii.l-Page_533"></a>many chambers, courts, and upper and lower apartments; the whole richly adorned with a profusion of gold, brass, and other materials of the most costly kind.</p>
