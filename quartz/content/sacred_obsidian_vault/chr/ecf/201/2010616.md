 </p><p class="c47"><a name="iv.vi.iv.xxx-p1"></a>  <span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.iv.xxx-p1.1"></a>Chapter XXX</span>.—<i>That he marked out before a Covetous Man the Measure of a Grave, and so put him to Shame.</i></p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.iv.xxx-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.iv.xxx-p2.1"></a>On</span> one occasion he thus personally addressed one of his courtiers: “How far, my friend, are we to carry our inordinate desires?” Then drawing the dimensions of a human figure with a lance which he happened to have in his hand, he continued: “Though thou couldst obtain the whole wealth of this world, yea, the whole world itself, thou wilt carry with thee at last no more than this little spot which I have marked out, if indeed even that be thine.” <a name="fr_3328"></a><a href="#fn_3328"><font size="1">3329</font></a>
  Such were the words and actions of this blessed prince; and though at the time he failed to reclaim any from their evil ways, yet notwithstanding the course of events afforded evident proof that his admonitions were more like Divine prophecies than mere words.</p>
