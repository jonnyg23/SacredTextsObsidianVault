 <p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.i.xix-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.i.xix-p2.1"></a>The</span> latter had been with his fathers imperial colleagues, <a name="fr_3088"></a><a href="#fn_3088"><font size="1">3089</font></a>
  and had passed his life among them, as we have said, like Gods ancient prophet. And even in the very earliest period of his youth he was judged by them to be worthy of the highest honor. An instance of this we have ourselves seen, when he passed through Palestine with the senior emperor, <a name="fr_3089"></a><a href="#fn_3089"><font size="1">3090</font></a>
  at whose right hand he stood, and commanded the admiration of all who beheld him by the indications he gave even then of royal greatness. For no one was comparable to him for grace and beauty of person, or height of stature; and he so far surpassed his compeers in personal strength as to be a terror to them. He was, however, even more conspicuous for the excellence of his mental <a name="fr_3090"></a><a href="#fn_3090"><font size="1">3091</font></a>
  qualities than for his superior physical endowments; being gifted in the first place with a sound judgment, <a name="fr_3091"></a><a href="#fn_3091"><font size="1">3092</font></a>
  and having also reaped the advantages of a liberal education. He was <a name="page_488"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 488</font></a> <a name="iv.vi.i.xix-Page_488"></a>also distinguished in no ordinary degree both by natural intelligence and divinely imparted wisdom.</p>
