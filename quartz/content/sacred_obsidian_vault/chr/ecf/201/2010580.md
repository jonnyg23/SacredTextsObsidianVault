 <p class="c108"><a name="iv.vi.iii.lxi-p2"></a>The Emperors Letter to me on my refusing the Bishopric of Antioch.</p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.iii.lxi-p3"></a>“<span class="c13"><a name="iv.vi.iii.lxi-p3.1"></a>Victor Constantinus, Maximus Augustus</span>, to Eusebius.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.vi.iii.lxi-p4"></a>“I have most carefully perused your letter, and perceive that you have strictly conformed to the rule enjoined by the discipline of the Church. Now to abide by that which appears at the same time pleasing to God, and accordant with apostolical tradition, is a proof of true piety. You have reason to deem yourself happy on this behalf, that you are counted worthy, in the judgment, I may say, of all the world, to have the oversight of any church. For the desire which all feel to claim you for their own, undoubtedly enhances your enviable fortune in this respect. Notwithstanding, your Prudence whose resolve it is to observe the ordinances of God and the apostolic canon of the Church, <a name="fr_3299"></a><a href="#fn_3299"><font size="1">3300</font></a>
  has done excellently well in declining the bishopric of the church at Antioch, and desiring to continue in that church of which you first received the oversight by the will of God. I have written on this subject to the people of Antioch, and also to your colleagues in the ministry who had themselves consulted me in regard to this question; on reading which letters, your Holiness will easily discern, that, inasmuch as justice itself opposed their claims, I have written to them under divine direction. It will be necessary that your Prudence should be present at their conference, in order that this decision may be ratified in the church at Antioch. God preserve you, beloved brother!”</p>
