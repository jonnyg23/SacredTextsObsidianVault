 <p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.ii.xxxiv-p2"></a>“<span class="c13"><a name="iv.vi.ii.xxxiv-p2.1"></a>Lastly</span>, if any have wrongfully been deprived of the privileges of noble lineage, and subjected to a judicial sentence which has consigned them <a name="page_509"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 509</font></a> <a name="iv.vi.ii.xxxiv-Page_509"></a>to the womens apartments <a name="fr_3186"></a><a href="#fn_3186"><font size="1">3187</font></a>
  and to the linen making, there to undergo a cruel and miserable labor, or reduced them to servitude for the benefit of the public treasury, without any exemption on the ground of superior birth; let such persons, resuming the honors they had previously enjoyed, and their proper dignities, henceforward exult in the blessings of liberty, and lead a glad life. Let the free man, <a name="fr_3187"></a><a href="#fn_3187"><font size="1">3188</font></a>
  too, by some injustice and inhumanity, or even madness, made a slave, who has felt the sudden transition from liberty to bondage, and ofttimes bewailed his unwonted labors, return to his family once more a free man in virtue of this our ordinance, and seek those employments which befit a state of freedom; and let him dismiss from his remembrance those services which he found so oppressive, and which so ill became his condition.</p>
