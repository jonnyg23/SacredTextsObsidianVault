 <p><a name="iii.iii.i.ix-p2"></a>In less than two years after the celebration of his <i>tricennalia</i>, on May 22, 337 <span class="c13"><a name="iii.iii.i.ix-p2.1"></a>a.d.</span>, the great Constantine breathed his last, in Nicomedia, his former Capital. Eusebius, already an old man, produced a lasting testimonial of his own unbounded affection and admiration for the first Christian emperor, in his <i>Life of Constantine</i>. Soon afterward he followed his imperial friend at the <a name="page_26"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 26</font></a> <a name="iii.iii.i.ix-Page_26"></a>advanced age of nearly, if not quite, eighty years. The exact date of his death is unknown, but it can be fixed approximately. We know from Sozomen (<i>H. E</i>. III. 5) that in the summer of 341, when a council was held at Antioch (on the date of the Council, which we are able to fix with great exactness, see Hefele, <i>Conciliengesch</i>. I. p. 502 sq.) Acacius, Eusebius successor, was already bishop of Cæsarea. Socrates (<i>H. E</i>. II. 4) and Sozomen (<i>H. E</i>. III. 2) both mention the death of Eusebius and place it shortly before the death of Constantine the younger, which took place early in 340 (see Tillemonts <i>Hist. des Emp</i>. IV. p. 327 sq.), and after the intrigues had begun which resulted in Athanasius second banishment. We are thus led to place Eusebius death late in the year 339, or early in the year 340 (cf. Lightfoots article, p. 318).</p>
