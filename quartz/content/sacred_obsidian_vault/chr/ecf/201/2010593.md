 </p><p class="c47"><a name="iv.vi.iv.vii-p1"></a>  <span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.iv.vii-p1.1"></a>Chapter VII</span>.—<i>Ambassadors from Different Barbarous Nations receive Presents from the Emperor.</i></p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.iv.vii-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.iv.vii-p2.1"></a>Indeed</span>, ambassadors were continually arriving from all nations, bringing for his acceptance their most precious gifts. So that I myself have sometimes stood near the entrance of the imperial palace, and observed a noticeable array of barbarians in attendance, differing from each other in costume and decorations, and equally unlike in the fashion of their hair and beard. Their aspect truculent and terrible, their bodily stature prodigious: some of a red complexion, others white as snow, others again of an intermediate color. For in the number of those I have referred to might be seen specimens of the Blemmyan tribes, of the Indians, and the Ethiopians, <a name="fr_3312"></a><a href="#fn_3312"><font size="1">3313</font></a>
  “that widely-divided race, remotest of mankind.” All these in due succession, like some painted pageant, presented to the emperor those gifts which their own nation held in most esteem; some offering crowns of gold, others diadems set with precious stones; some bringing fair-haired boys, others barbaric vestments embroidered with gold and flowers: some appeared with horses, others with shields and long spears, with arrows and bows, thereby offering their services and alliance for the emperors acceptance. These presents he separately received and carefully laid aside, acknowledging them in so munificent a manner as at once to enrich those who bore them. He also honored the noblest among them with Roman offices of dignity; so that many of them thenceforward preferred to continue their residence among us, and felt no desire to revisit their native land.</p>
