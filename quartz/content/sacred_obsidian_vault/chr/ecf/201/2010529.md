 </p><p class="c47"><a name="iv.vi.iii.x-p1"></a>  <span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.iii.x-p1.1"></a>Chapter X</span>.—<i>Council in the Palace. Constantine, entering, took his Seat in the Assembly.</i></p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.iii.x-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.iii.x-p2.1"></a>Now</span> when the appointed day arrived on which the council met for the final solution of the questions in dispute, each member was present for this in the central building of the palace, <a name="fr_3245"></a><a href="#fn_3245"><font size="1">3246</font></a>
  which appeared to exceed the rest in magnitude. On each side of the interior of this were many seats disposed in order, which were occupied by those who had been invited to attend, according to their rank. As soon, then, as the whole assembly had seated themselves with becoming orderliness, a general silence prevailed, in expectation of the emperors arrival. And first of all, three of his immediate family entered in succession, then others also preceded his approach, not of the soldiers or guards who usually accompanied him, but only friends in the faith. And now, all rising at the signal which indicated the emperors entrance, at last he himself proceeded through the midst of the assembly, like some heavenly messenger of God, clothed in raiment which glittered as it were with rays of light, reflecting the glowing radiance of a purple robe, and adorned with the brilliant splendor of gold and precious stones. Such was the external appearance of his person; and with regard to his mind, it was evident that he was distinguished by piety and godly fear. This was indicated by his downcast eyes, the blush on his countenance, and his gait. For the rest of his personal excellencies, he surpassed all present in height of stature and beauty of form, as well as in majestic dignity of mien, and invincible strength and vigor. All these graces, united to a suavity of manner, and a serenity becoming his imperial station, declared the excellence of his mental qualities to be above all praise. <a name="fr_3246"></a><a href="#fn_3246"><font size="1">3247</font></a>
  As soon as he had advanced to the upper end of the seats, at first he remained standing, and when a low chair of wrought gold had been set for him, he waited until the bishops had beckoned to him, and then sat down, and after him the whole assembly did the same.</p>
