 </p><p class="c47"><a name="iv.vi.iii.xxi-p1"></a>  <span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.iii.xxi-p1.1"></a>Chapter XXI</span>.—<i>Recommendation to the Bishops, on their Departure, to Preserve Harmony.</i></p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.iii.xxi-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.iii.xxi-p2.1"></a>And</span> now, when the council was on the point of being finally dissolved, he summoned all the bishops to meet him on an appointed day, and on their arrival addressed them in a farewell <a name="page_526"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 526</font></a> <a name="iv.vi.iii.xxi-Page_526"></a>speech, in which he recommended them to be diligent in the maintenance of peace, to avoid contentious disputations, amongst themselves and not to be jealous, if any one of their number should appear pre-eminent for wisdom and eloquence, but to esteem the excellence of one a blessing common to all. On the other hand he reminded them that the more gifted should forbear to exalt themselves to the prejudice of their humbler brethren, since it is Gods prerogative to judge of real superiority. Rather should they considerately condescend to the weaker, remembering that absolute perfection in any case is a rare quality indeed. Each then, should be willing to accord indulgence to the other for slight offenses, to regard charitably and pass over mere human weaknesses; holding mutual harmony in the highest honor, that no occasion of mockery might be given by their dissensions to those who are ever ready to blaspheme the word of God: whom indeed we should do all in our power to save, and this cannot be unless our conduct seems to them attractive. But you are well aware of the fact that testimony is by no means productive of blessing to all, since some who hear are glad to secure the supply of their mere bodily necessities, while others court the patronage of their superiors; some fix their affection on those who treat them with hospitable kindness, others again, being honored with presents, love their benefactors in return; but few are they who really desire the word of testimony, and rare indeed is it to find a friend of truth. Hence the necessity of endeavoring to meet the case of all, and, physician-like, to administer to each that which may tend to the health of the soul, to the end that the saving doctrine may be fully honored by all. Of this kind was the former part of his exhortation; <a name="fr_3259"></a><a href="#fn_3259"><font size="1">3260</font></a>
  and in conclusion he enjoined them to offer diligent supplications to God on his behalf. Having thus taken leave of them, he gave them all permission to return to their respective countries; and this they did with joy, and thenceforward that unity of judgment at which they had arrived in the emperors presence continued to prevail, and those who had long been divided were bound together as members of the same body.</p>
