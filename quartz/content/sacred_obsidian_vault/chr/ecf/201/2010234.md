 </span> also is commemorated on account of his pious boldness in connection with this affair. He was a Roman of senatorial rank, and in favor with the emperors, and well known to all on account of his noble birth and wealth. Being present at the martyrs death, he took his body away on his shoulder, and arraying him in a splendid and costly garment, prepared him for the grave in a magnificent manner, and gave him fitting burial. <a name="fr_2292"></a><a href="#fn_2292"><font size="1">2293</font></a>
  The friends of this man, that remain to our day, relate many other facts concerning him.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.xii.xvii-p3"></a> We know nothing more about this Astyrius than is recorded here. Rufinus, in his <i>H. E.</i> VII. 13, tells us that he suffered martyrdom at about this time; but Eusebius says nothing of the kind, and it is therefore not at all probable that Rufinus is correct. He probably concluded, from Eusebius account of him, that he also suffered martyrdom.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.xii.xvii-p4"></a> Burton and Crusè close the chapter at this point, throwing the next sentence into chap. 17. Such a transposition, however, is unnecessary, and I have preferred to follow Valesius, Heinichen, Schwegler, and other editors, in dividing as above.</p>
