 <p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.i.xxxvii-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.i.xxxvii-p2.1"></a>Constantine</span>, however, filled with compassion on account of all these miseries, began to arm himself with all warlike preparation against the tyranny. Assuming therefore the Supreme God as his patron, and invoking His Christ to be his preserver and aid, and setting the victorious trophy, the salutary symbol, in front of his soldiers and body-guard, he marched with his whole forces, trying to obtain again for the Romans the freedom they had inherited from their ancestors.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.vi.i.xxxvii-p3"></a>And whereas, Maxentius, trusting more in his magic arts than in the affection of his subjects, dared not even advance outside the city gates, <a name="fr_3122"></a><a href="#fn_3122"><font size="1">3123</font></a>
  but had guarded every place and district and city subject to his tyranny, with large bodies of soldiers, <a name="fr_3123"></a><a href="#fn_3123"><font size="1">3124</font></a>
  the emperor, confiding in the help of God, advanced against the first and second and third divisions of the tyrants forces, defeated them all with ease at the first assault, <a name="fr_3124"></a><a href="#fn_3124"><font size="1">3125</font></a>
  and made his way into the very interior of Italy.</p>
