 <p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.iii.xlvi-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.iii.xlvi-p2.1"></a>And</span> when at length at the close of a long life, she was called to inherit a happier lot, having arrived at the eightieth year of her age, and being very near the time of her departure, she prepared and executed her last will in favor of her only son, the emperor and sole monarch of the world, and her grandchildren, the Cæsars his sons, to whom severally she bequeathed whatever property she possessed in any part of the world. Having thus made her will, this thrice blessed woman died in the presence of her illustrious son, who was in attendance at her side, caring for her and held her hands: so that, to those who rightly discerned the truth, the thrice blessed one seemed not to die, but to experience a real change and transition from an earthly to a heavenly existence, since her soul, remoulded as it were into an incorruptible and angelic essence, <a name="fr_3278"></a><a href="#fn_3278"><font size="1">3279</font></a>
  was received up into her Saviours presence. <a name="fr_3279"></a><a href="#fn_3279"><font size="1">3280</font></a>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iv.vi.iii.xlvi-p3"></a> [These words seem to savor of Origens doctrine, to which Eusebius was much addicted. Origen believed that, in the resurrection, bodies would be changed into souls, and souls into angels, according to the testimony of Jerome. See Valesius <i>in loc.</i>—<i>Bag.</i>]</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iv.vi.iii.xlvi-p4"></a> The date of Helenas death is usually placed in 327 or 328. Compare Wordsworth, l.c. Since she was eighty years old at the time of her death she must have been about twenty-five when Constantine was born.</p>
