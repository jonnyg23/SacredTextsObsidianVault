 </p><p class="c47"><a name="iv.vi.ii.xxxvii-p1"></a>  <span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.ii.xxxvii-p1.1"></a>Chapter XXXVII</span> —<i>Lands, Gardens, or Houses, but not Actual Produce from them, are to be given back.</i></p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.ii.xxxvii-p2"></a>“<span class="c13"><a name="iv.vi.ii.xxxvii-p2.1"></a>And</span> that there may be no obscurity in this our ordinance, but every one may readily apprehend its requirements, let all men hereby know that if they are now maintaining themselves in possession of a piece of land, or a house, or garden, or anything else which had appertained to the before-mentioned persons, it will be good and advantageous for them to acknowledge the fact, and make restitution with the least possible delay. On the other hand, although it should appear that some individuals have reaped abundant profits from this unjust possession, we do not consider that justice demands the restitution of such profits. They must, however, declare explicitly what amount of benefit they have thus derived, and from what sources, and entreat our pardon for this offense; in order that their past covetousness may in some measure be atoned for, and that the Supreme God may accept this compensation as a token of contrition, and be pleased graciously to pardon the sin.</p>
