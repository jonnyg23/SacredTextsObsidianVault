 <p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.iv.xliii-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.iv.xliii-p2.1"></a>No</span> sooner had these injunctions been carried into effect, than another emissary arrived with despatches from the emperor, and an urgent admonition to the Council to hasten their journey to Jerusalem without delay. <a name="fr_3339"></a><a href="#fn_3339"><font size="1">3340</font></a>
  Accordingly they all took their departure from the province of Phœnicia, and proceeded to their destination, availing themselves of the public means of transport.

  the Pannonians and Mœsians the fairest of Gods youthful flock among them. A holy prelate from Persia too was there, deeply versed in the sacred oracles; while Bithynian and Thracian bishops graced the Council with their presence; nor were the most illustrious from Cilicia wanting, nor the chief of the Cappadocians, distinguished above all for learning and eloquence. In short, the whole of Syria and Mesopotamia, Phœnicia and Arabia, Palestine, Egypt, and Libya, with the dwellers in the Thebaid, all contributed to swell the mighty concourse of Gods ministers, followed as they were by vast numbers from every province. They were attended by an imperial escort, <a name="fr_3341"></a><a href="#fn_3341"><font size="1">3342</font></a>
  and officers of trust had also been sent from the palace itself, with instructions to heighten the splendor of the festival at the emperors expense.</p>
