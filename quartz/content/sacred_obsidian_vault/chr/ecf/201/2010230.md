 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.xii.xiii-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iii.xii.xiii-p2.1"></a>During</span> the above-mentioned persecution under Valerian, three men in Cæsarea in Palestine, being conspicuous in their confession of Christ, were adorned with divine martyrdom, becoming food for wild beasts. One of them was called Priscus, another Malchus, and the name of the third was Alexander. <a name="fr_2264"></a><a href="#fn_2264"><font size="1">2265</font></a>
  They say that these men, who lived in the country, acted at first in a cowardly manner, as if they were careless and thoughtless. For when the opportunity was given to those who longed for the prize with heavenly desire, they treated it lightly, lest they should seize the Crown of martyrdom prematurely. But having deliberated on the matter, they hastened to Cæsarea, and went before the judge and met the end we have mentioned. They relate that besides these, in the same persecution and the same city, a certain woman endured a similar conflict. But it is reported that she belonged to the sect of Marcion. <a name="fr_2265"></a><a href="#fn_2265"><font size="1">2266</font></a>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.xii.xiii-p4"></a> Marcionitic martyrs are mentioned by Eusebius in Bk. IV. chap. 15, and in <i>Martyrs of Pal.</i> chap. 10. In <i>H. E.</i> V. 16, it is stated that the Marcionites as well as the Montanists had many martyrs, but that the orthodox Christians did not acknowledge them as Christians, and would not recognize them even when they were martyred together. Of course they were all alike Christians in the eyes of the state, and hence all alike subject to persecution.</p>
