 </p><p class="c47"><a name="iii.xii.xxix-p1"></a>  <span class="c11"><a name="iii.xii.xxix-p1.1"></a>Chapter XXVIII.—</span><i>The Illustrious Bishops of that Time.</i></p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.xii.xxix-p2"></a>1. <span class="c13"><a name="iii.xii.xxix-p2.1"></a>Of</span> these, the most eminent were Firmilianus, <a name="fr_2380"></a><a href="#fn_2380"><font size="1">2381</font></a>
  bishop of Cæsarea in Cappadocia; the brothers Gregory <a name="fr_2381"></a><a href="#fn_2381"><font size="1">2382</font></a>
  and Athenodorus, pastors of the churches in Pontus; Helenus <a name="fr_2382"></a><a href="#fn_2382"><font size="1">2383</font></a>
  of the parish of Tarsus, and Nicomas <a name="fr_2383"></a><a href="#fn_2383"><font size="1">2384</font></a>
  of Iconium; moreover, Hymenæus, <a name="fr_2384"></a><a href="#fn_2384"><font size="1">2385</font></a>
  of the church of Jerusalem, and Theotecnus <a name="fr_2385"></a><a href="#fn_2385"><font size="1">2386</font></a>
  of the neighboring church of Cæsarea; and besides these Maximus, <a name="fr_2386"></a><a href="#fn_2386"><font size="1">2387</font></a>
  who presided in a distinguished manner over the brethren in Bostra. If any should count them up he could not fail to note a great many others, besides presbyters and deacons, who were at that time assembled for the same cause in the above-mentioned city. <a name="fr_2387"></a><a href="#fn_2387"><font size="1">2388</font></a>
  But <a name="page_313"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 313</font></a> <a name="iii.xii.xxix-Page_313"></a>these were the most illustrious.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.xii.xxix-p11"></a>2. When all of these assembled at different times and frequently to consider these matters, the arguments and questions were discussed at every meeting; the adherents of the Samosatian endeavoring to cover and conceal his heterodoxy, and the others striving zealously to lay bare and make manifest his heresy and blasphemy against Christ.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.xii.xxix-p12"></a>3. Meanwhile, Dionysius died in the twelfth year of the reign of Gallienus, <a name="fr_2388"></a><a href="#fn_2388"><font size="1">2389</font></a>
  having held the episcopate of Alexandria for seventeen years, and Maximus <a name="fr_2389"></a><a href="#fn_2389"><font size="1">2390</font></a>
  succeeded him.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.xii.xxix-p15"></a>4. Gallienus after a reign of fifteen years <a name="fr_2390"></a><a href="#fn_2390"><font size="1">2391</font></a>
  was succeeded by Claudius, <a name="fr_2391"></a><a href="#fn_2391"><font size="1">2392</font></a>
  who in two years delivered the government to Aurelian.</p>

He presided at the final council which deposed Paul of Samosata, according to the <i>Libellus Synodicus</i> (see Labbe, <i>Concilia,</i> I. 893, 901), and this is confirmed by the fact that in the encyclical epistle written by this synod his name stands first (see chap. 30).</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.xii.xxix-p13"></a> In both versions of the <i>Chron.</i> the death of Dionysius is put in the eleventh year of Gallienus, i.e. August, 263, to August, 264, and this, or the date given here by Eusebius (the twelfth year, August, 264, to August, 265) is undoubtedly correct. Upon the dates of his accession and death, see Bk. VI. chap. 40, note 1.</p>
 <a name="fn_2389"></a><a href="2010246.htm#fr_2389">313:2390</a> <a name="iii.xii.xxix-p13.1"></a>
 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.xii.xxix-p14"></a> Maximus had been a presbyter while Dionysius was bishop of Alexandria, and had shared with him the hardships of the Decian and Valerian persecutions (see above, chap. 11). In chap. 32, he is said to have held office eighteen years, and with this both versions of the <i>Chron.</i> agree, and there is no reason to doubt the accuracy of the report.</p>
 <a name="fn_2390"></a><a href="2010246.htm#fr_2390">313:2391</a> <a name="iii.xii.xxix-p15.1"></a>
 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.xii.xxix-p16"></a> Eusebius here, as in his <i>Chron.,</i> reckons the reign of Gallienus as beginning with the date of his association with his father in the supreme power; i.e. August, 253.</p>
 <a name="fn_2391"></a><a href="2010246.htm#fr_2391">313:2392</a> <a name="iii.xii.xxix-p16.1"></a>
 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.xii.xxix-p17"></a> Claudius became emperor in March, 268, and died of an epidemic in Sirmium some time in the year 270, when he was succeeded by Aurelian, whom he had himself appointed his successor just before his death. It is, perhaps, with this in mind that Eusebius uses the somewhat peculiar phrase, <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.xii.xxix-p17.1"></a>μεταδίδωσι τὴν ἡγεμονίαν</span></p>
