 </p><p class="c47"><a name="iv.vi.ii.xxx-p1"></a>  <span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.ii.xxx-p1.1"></a>Chapter XXX</span>.—<i>A Law granting Release from Exile, from Service in the Courts, and from the Confiscation of Property.</i></p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.ii.xxx-p2"></a>“<span class="c13"><a name="iv.vi.ii.xxx-p2.1"></a>Let</span> all therefore who have exchanged their country for a foreign land, because they would not abandon that reverence and faith toward God to which they had devoted themselves with their whole hearts, and have in consequence at different times been subject to the cruel sentence of the courts; together with any who have been enrolled in the registers of the public courts though in time past exempt from such office; let these, I say, now render thanks to God the Liberator of all, in that they are restored to their hereditary property, and their wonted tranquility. Let those also who have been despoiled of their goods, and have hitherto passed a wretched existence, mourning under the loss of all that they possessed, once more be restored to their former homes, their families, and estates, and receive with joy the bountiful kindness of God.</p>
