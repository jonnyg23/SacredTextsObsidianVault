 </p><p class="c47"><a name="iii.vi.iv-p1"></a>  <span class="c11"><a name="iii.vi.iv-p1.1"></a>Chapter IV.—</span><i>The Religion Proclaimed by Him to All Nations Was Neither New Nor Strange.</i></p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.vi.iv-p2"></a>1. <span class="c13"><a name="iii.vi.iv-p2.1"></a>But</span> that no one may suppose that his doctrine is new and strange, as if it were framed by a man of recent origin, differing in no respect from other men, let us now briefly consider this point also.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p3"></a>2. It is admitted that when in recent times the appearance of our Saviour Jesus Christ had become known to all men there immediately made its appearance a new nation; a nation confessedly not small, and not dwelling in some corner of the earth, but the most numerous and pious of all nations, <a name="fr_65"></a><a href="#fn_65"><font size="1">66</font></a>
  indestructible and unconquerable, because it always receives assistance from God. This nation, thus suddenly appearing at the time appointed by the inscrutable counsel of God, is the one which has been honored by all with the name of Christ.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p5"></a>3. One of the prophets, when he saw beforehand with the eye of the Divine Spirit that which was to be, was so astonished at it that he cried out, “Who hath heard of such things, and who hath spoken thus? Hath the earth brought forth in one day, and hath a nation been born at once?” <a name="fr_66"></a><a href="#fn_66"><font size="1">67</font></a>
  And the same prophet gives a hint also of the name by which the nation was to be called, when he says, “Those that serve me shall be called by a new name, which shall be blessed upon the earth.” <a name="fr_67"></a><a href="#fn_67"><font size="1">68</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p8"></a>4. But although it is clear that we are new and that this new name of Christians has really but recently been known among all nations, nevertheless our life and our conduct, with our doctrines of religion, have not been lately invented by us, but from the first creation of man, so to speak, have been established by the natural understanding of divinely favored men of old. That this is so we shall show in the following way.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p9"></a>5. That the Hebrew nation is not new, but is universally honored on account of its antiquity, is known to all. The books and writings of this people contain accounts of ancient men, rare indeed and few in number, but nevertheless distinguished for piety and righteousness and every other virtue. Of these, some excellent men lived before the flood, others of the sons and descendants of Noah lived after it, among them Abraham, whom the Hebrews celebrate as their own founder and forefather.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p10"></a>6. If any one should assert that all those who have enjoyed the testimony of righteousness, from Abraham himself back to the first man, were Christians in fact if not in name, he would not go beyond the truth. <a name="fr_68"></a><a href="#fn_68"><font size="1">69</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p12"></a>7. For that which the name indicates, that the Christian man, through the knowledge and the teaching of Christ, is distinguished for temperance and righteousness, for patience in life and manly virtue, and for a profession of piety toward the one and only God over all—all that was zealously practiced by them not less than by us.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p13"></a>8. They did not care about circumcision of the body, neither do we. They did not care about observing Sabbaths, nor do we. They did not avoid certain kinds of food, neither did they regard the other distinctions which Moses first delivered to their posterity to be observed as symbols; nor do Christians of the present day do such things. But they also clearly knew the very Christ of God; for it has already been shown that he appeared unto Abraham, that he imparted revelations to Isaac, that he talked with Jacob, that he held converse with Moses and with the prophets that came after.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p14"></a>9. Hence you will find those divinely favored men honored with the name of Christ, according to the passage which says of them, “Touch not my Christs, and do my prophets no harm.” <a name="fr_69"></a><a href="#fn_69"><font size="1">70</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p16"></a><a name="page_88"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 88</font></a> <a name="iii.vi.iv-Page_88"></a>10. So that it is clearly necessary to consider that religion, which has lately been preached to all nations through the teaching of Christ, the first and most ancient of all religions, and the one discovered by those divinely favored men in the age of Abraham.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p17"></a>11. If it is said that Abraham, a long time afterward, was given the command of circumcision, we reply that nevertheless before this it was declared that he had received the testimony of righteousness through faith; as the divine word says, “Abraham believed in God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.” <a name="fr_70"></a><a href="#fn_70"><font size="1">71</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p19"></a>12. And indeed unto Abraham, who was thus before his circumcision a justified man, there was given by God, who revealed himself unto him (but this was Christ himself, the word of God), a prophecy in regard to those who in coming ages should be justified in the same way as he. The prophecy was in the following words: “And in thee shall all the tribes of the earth be blessed.” <a name="fr_71"></a><a href="#fn_71"><font size="1">72</font></a>
  And again, “He shall become a nation great and numerous; and in him shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.” <a name="fr_72"></a><a href="#fn_72"><font size="1">73</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p22"></a>13. It is permissible to understand this as fulfilled in us. For he, having renounced the superstition of his fathers, and the former error of his life, and having confessed the one God over all, and having worshiped him with deeds of virtue, and not with the service of the law which was afterward given by Moses, was justified by faith in Christ, the Word of God, who appeared unto him. To him, then, who was a man of this character, it was said that all the tribes and all the nations of the earth should be blessed in him.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p23"></a>14. But that very religion of Abraham has reappeared at the present time, practiced in deeds, more efficacious than words, by Christians alone throughout the world.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.vi.iv-p24"></a>15. What then should prevent the confession that we who are of Christ practice one and the same mode of life and have one and the same religion as those divinely favored men of old? Whence it is evident that the perfect religion committed to us by the teaching of Christ is not new and strange, but, if the truth must be spoken, it is the first and the true religion. This may suffice for this subject.</p>
