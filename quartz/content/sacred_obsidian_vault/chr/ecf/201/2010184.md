 </p><p class="c47"><a name="iii.xi.xiv-p1"></a>  <span class="c11"><a name="iii.xi.xiv-p1.1"></a>Chapter XIV.—</span><i>The Scriptures mentioned by Him.</i></p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.xi.xiv-p2"></a>1. <span class="c13"><a name="iii.xi.xiv-p2.1"></a>To</span> sum up briefly, he has given in the Hypotyposes <a name="fr_1868"></a><a href="#fn_1868"><font size="1">1869</font></a>
  abridged accounts of all canonical Scripture, not omitting the disputed books, <a name="fr_1869"></a><a href="#fn_1869"><font size="1">1870</font></a>
 —I refer to Jude and the other Catholic epistles, and Barnabas <a name="fr_1870"></a><a href="#fn_1870"><font size="1">1871</font></a>
  and the so-called Apocalypse of Peter. <a name="fr_1871"></a><a href="#fn_1871"><font size="1">1872</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="iii.xi.xiv-p7"></a>2. He says that the Epistle to the Hebrews <a name="fr_1872"></a><a href="#fn_1872"><font size="1">1873</font></a>
  is the work of Paul, and that it was written to the Hebrews in the Hebrew language; but that Luke translated it carefully and published it for the Greeks, and hence the same style of expression is found in this epistle and in the Acts.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.xi.xiv-p9"></a>3. But he says that the words, Paul the Apostle, were probably not prefixed, because, in sending it to the Hebrews, who were prejudiced and suspicious of him, he wisely did not wish to repel them at the very beginning by giving his name.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.xi.xiv-p10"></a>4. Farther on he says: “But now, as the blessed presbyter said, since the Lord being the apostle of the Almighty, was sent to the Hebrews, Paul, as sent to the Gentiles, on account of his modesty did not subscribe himself an apostle of the Hebrews, through respect for the Lord, and because being a herald and apostle of the Gentiles he wrote to the Hebrews out of his superabundance.”</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.xi.xiv-p11"></a>5. Again, in the same books, Clement gives the tradition of the earliest presbyters, as to the order of the Gospels, in the following manner:</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.xi.xiv-p12"></a>6. The Gospels containing the genealogies, he says, were written first. The Gospel according to Mark <a name="fr_1873"></a><a href="#fn_1873"><font size="1">1874</font></a>
  had this occasion. As Peter had preached the Word publicly at Rome, and declared the Gospel by the Spirit, many who were present requested that Mark, who had followed him for a long time and remembered his sayings, should write them out. And having composed the Gospel he gave it to those who had requested it.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.xi.xiv-p14"></a>7. When Peter learned of this, he neither directly forbade nor encouraged it. But, last of all, John, perceiving that the external <a name="fr_1874"></a><a href="#fn_1874"><font size="1">1875</font></a>
  facts had been made plain in the Gospel, being urged by his friends, and inspired by the Spirit, composed a spiritual Gospel.” <a name="fr_1875"></a><a href="#fn_1875"><font size="1">1876</font></a>
  This is the account of Clement.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.xi.xiv-p17"></a>8. Again the above-mentioned Alexander, <a name="fr_1876"></a><a href="#fn_1876"><font size="1">1877</font></a>
  in a certain letter to Origen, refers to Clement, and at the same time to Pantænus, as being among his familiar acquaintances. He writes as follows:</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.xi.xiv-p19"></a>“For this, as thou knowest, was the will of God, that the ancestral friendship existing between us should remain unshaken; nay, rather should be warmer and stronger.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.xi.xiv-p20"></a>9. For we know well those blessed fathers who have trodden the way before us, with whom we shall soon be; <a name="fr_1877"></a><a href="#fn_1877"><font size="1">1878</font></a>
  Pantænus, the truly blessed man and master, and the holy Clement, my master and benefactor, and if there is any other like them, through whom I became acquainted with thee, the best in everything, my master and brother.” <a name="fr_1878"></a><a href="#fn_1878"><font size="1">1879</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="iii.xi.xiv-p23"></a>10. So much for these matters. But Adamantius, <a name="fr_1879"></a><a href="#fn_1879"><font size="1">1880</font></a>
 —for this also was a name of Origen,—when Zephyrinus <a name="fr_1880"></a><a href="#fn_1880"><font size="1">1881</font></a>
  was bishop of Rome, visited <a name="page_262"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 262</font></a> <a name="iii.xi.xiv-Page_262"></a>Rome, “desiring,” as he himself somewhere says, “to see the most ancient church of Rome.”</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.xi.xiv-p26"></a>11. After a short stay there he returned to Alexandria. And he performed the duties of catechetical instruction there with great zeal; Demetrius, who was bishop there at that time, urging and even entreating him to work diligently for the benefit of the brethren. <a name="fr_1881"></a><a href="#fn_1881"><font size="1">1882</font></a>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.xi.xiv-p21"></a> We see from this sentence that at the time of the writing of this epistle both Pantænus and Clement were dead. The latter was still alive when Alexander wrote to the Antiochenes (see chap. 11), i.e. about the year 211 (see note 5 on that chapter). How much longer he lived we cannot tell. The epistle referred to here must of course have been written at any rate subsequent to the year 211, and hence while Alexander was bishop of Jerusalem. The expression “with whom we shall soon be” (<span class="Greek"><a name="iii.xi.xiv-p21.1"></a>πρὸς οὕς μετ᾽ ὀλίγον ἐσόμεθα</span>) seems to imply that the epistle was written when Alexander and Origen were advanced in life, but this cannot be pressed.</p>
 <a name="fn_1878"></a><a href="2010184.htm#fr_1878">261:1879</a> <a name="iii.xi.xiv-p21.2"></a>
 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.xi.xiv-p22"></a> It is from this passage that we gather that Alexander was a student of Clements and a fellow-pupil of Origens (see chap. 8, note 6, and chap. 2, note 1). The epistle does not state this directly, but the conclusion seems sufficiently obvious.</p>
 <a name="fn_1879"></a><a href="2010184.htm#fr_1879">261:1880</a> <a name="iii.xi.xiv-p23.1"></a>
 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.xi.xiv-p24"></a> The name Adamantius (<span class="Greek"><a name="iii.xi.xiv-p24.1"></a>᾽</span><span class="Greek"><a name="iii.xi.xiv-p24.2"></a>Αδαμ€ντιος</span> from <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.xi.xiv-p24.3"></a>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><a name="iii.xi.xiv-p24.4"></a>δ€μας</span> <i>unconquerable,</i>hence <i>hard, adamantine</i>) is said by Jerome (<i>Ep. ad Paulam,</i> §3; Mignes ed. <i>Ep.</i> XXXIII.) to have been given him on account of his untiring industry, by Photius (<i>Cod.</i> 118) on account of the invincible force of his arguments, and by Epiphanius (<i>Hær.</i> LXIV. 74) to have been vainly adopted by himself. But Eusebius simple statement at this point looks rather as if <i>Adamantius</i> was a second name which belonged to Origen from the beginning, and had no reference to his character. We know that two names were very common in that age. This opinion is adopted by Tillemont, Redepenning, Westcott, and others, although many still hold the opposite view. Another name, <i>Chalcenterus,</i> given to him by Jerome in the epistle already referred to, was undoubtedly, as we can see from the context, applied to him by Jerome, because of his resemblance to Didymus of Alexandria (who bore that surname) in his immense industry as an author.</p>
 <a name="fn_1880"></a><a href="2010184.htm#fr_1880">261:1881</a> <a name="iii.xi.xiv-p24.5"></a>
 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.xi.xiv-p25"></a> On Zephyrinus, bishop of Rome, see Bk. V. chap. 28, note 5. He was bishop from about 198, or 199, to 217. This gives considerable range for the date of Origens visit to Rome, which we have no means of fixing with exactness. There is no reason for supposing that Eusebius is incorrect in putting it among the events occurring during Caracallas reign (211–217). On the other hand, it must have taken place before the year 216, for in that year Origen went to Palestine (see chap. 19, note 23) and remained there some time. Whether Origens visit was undertaken simply from the desire to see the church of Rome, as Eusebius says, or in connection with matters of business, we cannot tell.</p>
