 <p class="c1"><a name="vii.1.CCXXIX-p2"></a>(<span class="c9"><a name="vii.1.CCXXIX-p2.1"></a>a.d.</span> 429.)</p>  
 <p class="c58"><a name="vii.1.CCXXIX-p3"></a><i><span class="c9"><a name="vii.1.CCXXIX-p3.1"></a>To Darius,</span></i> <a name="fr_2993"></a><a href="#fn_2993"><font size="1">2994</font></a>
 <i><span class="c9"><a name="vii.1.CCXXIX-p4.1"></a>His Deservedly Illustrious and Very Powerful Lord and Dear Son Christ, Augustin Sends Greeting in the Lord.</span></i></p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CCXXIX-p5"></a>1. Your character and rank I have learned from my holy brothers and co-bishops, Urbanus and Novatus. The former of these became acquainted with you near Carthage, in the town of Hilari, and more recently in the town of Sicca; the latter at Sitifis. Through them it has come to pass that I cannot regard you as unknown to me. For though my bodily weakness and the chill of age do not permit me to converse with you personally, it cannot on this account be said that I have not seen you; for the conversation of Urbanus, when he kindly visited me, and the letters of Novatus, so described to me the features, not of your face but of your mind, that I have seen you, and have seen you with all the more pleasure, because I have seen not the outward appearance but the inner man. These features of your character are joyfully seen both by us, and through the mercy of God by yourself also, as in a mirror in the holy Gospel, in which it is written in words uttered by Him who is truth: “Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.” <a name="fr_2994"></a><a href="#fn_2994"><font size="1">2995</font></a>

 <p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CCXXIX-p7"></a>2. Those warriors are indeed great and worthy of singular honour, not only for their consummate bravery, but also (which is a higher praise) for their eminent fidelity, by whose labours and dangers, along with the blessing of divine protection and aid, enemies previously unsubdued are conquered, and peace obtained for the State, and the provinces reduced to subjection. But it is a higher glory still to stay war itself with a word, than to slay men with the sword, and to <a name="page_582"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 582</font></a> <a name="vii.1.CCXXIX-Page_582"></a>procure or maintain peace by peace, not by war. For those who fight, if they are good men, doubtless seek for peace; nevertheless it is through blood. Your mission, however, is to prevent the shedding of blood. Yours, therefore, is the privilege of averting that calamity which others are under the necessity of producing. Therefore, my deservedly illustrious and very powerful lord and very dear son in Christ, rejoice in this singularly great and real blessing vouchsafed to you, and enjoy it in God, to whom you owe that you are what you are, and that you undertook the accomplishment of such a work. May God “strengthen that which He hath wrought for us through you.” <a name="fr_2995"></a><a href="#fn_2995"><font size="1">2996</font></a>
  Accept this our salutation, and deign to reply. From the letter of my brother Novatus, I see that he has taken pains that your learned Excellency should become acquainted with me also through my works. If, then, you have read what he has given you, I also shall have become known to your inward perception. As far as I can judge, they will not greatly displease you if you have read them in a loving rather than a critical spirit. It is not much to ask, but it will be a great favour, if for this letter and my works you send us one letter in reply. I salute with due affection the pledge of peace, <a name="fr_2996"></a><a href="#fn_2996"><font size="1">2997</font></a>
  which through the favour of our Lord and God you have happily received.</p>
