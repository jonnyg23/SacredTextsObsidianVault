 <p class="c10"><a name="vi.XII.III-p2"></a>3. And truly this earth was invisible and formless, <a name="fr_1073"></a><a href="#fn_1073"><font size="1">1074</font></a>
  and there was I know not what profundity of the deep upon which there was no light, <a name="fr_1074"></a><a href="#fn_1074"><font size="1">1075</font></a>
  because it had no form. Therefore didst Thou command that it should be written, that darkness was upon the face of the deep; what else was it than the absence of light? <a name="fr_1075"></a><a href="#fn_1075"><font size="1">1076</font></a>
  For had there been light, where should it have been save by being above all, showing itself aloft, and enlightening? Darkness therefore was upon it, because the light above was absent; as silence is there present where sound is not. And what is it to have silence there, but not to have sound there? Hast not Thou, O Lord, taught this soul which confesseth unto Thee? Hast not Thou taught me, O Lord, that before Thou didst form and separate this formless matter, there was nothing, neither colour, nor figure, nor body, nor spirit? Yet not altogether nothing; there was a certain formlessness without any shape.</p>
