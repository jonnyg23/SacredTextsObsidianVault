 </p><p class="c41"><a name="vii.1.CXCI-p1"></a><span class="c2"><a name="vii.1.CXCI-p1.1"></a>Letter CXCI.</span></p>  
 <p class="c1"><a name="vii.1.CXCI-p2"></a>(<span class="c9"><a name="vii.1.CXCI-p2.1"></a>a.d.</span> 418.)</p>  
 <p class="c58"><a name="vii.1.CXCI-p3"></a><i><span class="c9"><a name="vii.1.CXCI-p3.1"></a>To My Venerable Lord and Pious Brother and Co-Presbyter Sixtus,</span></i> <a name="fr_2884"></a><a href="#fn_2884"><font size="1">2885</font></a>
 <i><span class="c9"><a name="vii.1.CXCI-p4.2"></a>Worthy of Being Received in the Love of Christ, Augustin Sends Greeting in the Lord.</span></i></p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CXCI-p5"></a>1. Since the arrival of the letter which, in my absence, your Grace forwarded by our holy brother the presbyter Firmus, and which I read on my return to Hippo, but not until after the bearer had departed, the present is my first opportunity <a name="page_555"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 555</font></a> <a name="vii.1.CXCI-Page_555"></a>of sending to you any reply, and it is with great pleasure that I entrust it to our very dearly beloved son, the acolyte Albinus. Your letter, addressed to Alypius and myself jointly, came at a time when we were not together, and this is the reason why you will now receive a letter from each of us, instead of one from both, in reply. For the bearer of this letter has just gone, meanwhile, from me to visit my venerable brother and co-bishop Alypius, who will write a reply for himself to your Holiness, and he has carried with him your letter, which I had already perused. As to the great joy with which that letter filled my heart, why should a man attempt to say what it is impossible to express? Indeed, I do not think that you yourself have any adequate idea of the amount of good done by your sending that letter to us; but take our word for it, for as you bear witness to your feelings, so do we bear witness to ours, declaring how profoundly we have been moved by the perfectly transparent soundness of the views declared in that letter. For if, when you sent a very short letter on the same subject to the most blessed aged Aurelius, by the acolyte Leo, we transcribed it with joyful alacrity, and read it with enthusiastic interest to all who were within our reach, as an exposition of your sentiments, both in regard to that most fatal dogma [of Pelagius], and in regard to the grace of God freely given by Him to small and great, to which that dogma is diametrically opposed; how great, think you, is the joy with which we have read this more extended statement in your writing, how great the zeal with which we take care that it be read by all to whom we have been able already or may yet be able to make it known! For what could be read or heard with greater satisfaction than so clear a defence of the grace of God against its enemies, from the mouth of one who was before this proudly claimed by these enemies as a mighty supporter of their cause? <a name="fr_2885"></a><a href="#fn_2885"><font size="1">2886</font></a>
  Or is there anything for which we ought to give more abundant thanksgivings to God, than that His grace is so ably defended by those to whom it is given, against those to whom it is not given, or by whom, when given, it is not accepted, because in the secret and just judgment of God the disposition to accept it is not given to them?</p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CXCI-p7"></a>2. Wherefore, my venerable lord, and holy brother worthy of being received in the love of Christ, although you render a most excellent service when you thus write on this subject to brethren before whom the adversaries are wont to boast themselves of your being their friend, nevertheless, there remains upon you the yet greater duty of seeing not only that those be punished with wholesome severity who dare to prate more openly their declaration of that error, most dangerously hostile to the Christian name, but also that with pastoral vigilance, on behalf of the weaker and simpler sheep of the Lord, most strenuous precautions be used against those who more covertly, indeed, and timidly, but perseveringly, and in whispers, as it were, teach this error, “creeping into houses,” as the apostle says, and doing with practised impiety all those other things which are mentioned immediately afterwards in that passage. <a name="fr_2886"></a><a href="#fn_2886"><font size="1">2887</font></a>
  Nor ought those to be overlooked who under the restraint of fear hide their sentiments under the most profound silence, yet have not ceased to cherish the same perverse opinions as before. For some of their party might be known to you before that pestilence was denounced by the most explicit condemnation of the apostolic see, whom you perceive to have now become suddenly silent; nor can it be ascertained whether they have been really cured of it, otherwise than through their not only forbearing from the utterance of these false dogmas, but also defending the truths which are opposed to their former errors with the same zeal as they used to show on the other side. These are, however, to be more gently dealt with; for what need is there for causing further terror to those whom their silence itself proves to be sufficiently terrified already? At the same time, though they should not be frightened, they should be taught; and in my opinion they may more easily, while their fear of severity assists the teacher of the truth, be so taught that by the Lords help, after they have learned to understand and love His grace, they may speak out as antagonists of the error which meanwhile they dare not confess.</p>
