 <p class="c1"><a name="vii.1.CLXXXVIII-p2"></a>(<span class="c9"><a name="vii.1.CLXXXVIII-p2.1"></a>a.d.</span> 416.)</p>  
 <p class="c40"><a name="vii.1.CLXXXVIII-p3"></a><span class="c9"><a name="vii.1.CLXXXVIII-p3.1"></a>To the Lady Juliana, Worthy to Be Honoured in Christ with the Service Due to Her Rank, Our Daughter Deservedly Distinguished, Alypius and Augustin Send Greeting in the Lord.</span></p>  
 <p><a name="vii.1.CLXXXVIII-p4"></a><span class="c9"><a name="vii.1.CLXXXVIII-p4.1"></a>Chap. I.</span></p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXXXVIII-p5"></a>1. Lady, worthy to be honoured in Christ with the service due to your rank, and daughter deservedly distinguished, it was very pleasant and agreeable to us that your letter reached us when together at Hippo, so that we might send this joint reply to you, to express our joy in hearing of your welfare, and with sincere reciprocation of your love to let you know of our welfare, in which we are sure that you take an affectionate interest. We are well aware that you are not ignorant how great Christian affection we consider due to you, and how much, both before God and among men, we are interested in you. For though we knew you, at first by letter, afterwards by personal intercourse, to be pious and Catholic, that is, true members <a name="page_549"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 549</font></a> <a name="vii.1.CLXXXVIII-Page_549"></a>of the body of Christ, nevertheless, our humble ministry also was of use to you, for when you had received the word of God from us, “you received it,” as says the apostle, “not as the word of men, but as it is in truth the word of God.” <a name="fr_2832"></a><a href="#fn_2832"><font size="1">2833</font></a>
  Through the grace and mercy of the Saviour, so great was the fruit arising from this ministery of ours in your family, that when preparations for her marriage <a name="fr_2833"></a><a href="#fn_2833"><font size="1">2834</font></a>
  were already completed, the holy Demetrias preferred the spiritual embrace of that Husband who is fairer than the sons of men, and in espousing themselves to whom virgins retain their virginity, and gain more abundant spiritual fruitfulness. We should not, however, yet have known how this exhortation of ours had been received by the faithful and noble maiden, as we departed shortly before she took on her the vow of chastity, had we not learned from the joyful announcement and reliable testimony of your letter, that this great gift of God, planted and watered indeed by means of His servants, but owing its increase to Himself, had been granted to us as labourers in His vineyard.</p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXXXVIII-p8"></a>2. Since these things are so, no one may charge us with presuming, if, on the ground of this closer spiritual relation, we manifest our solicitude for your welfare by warning you to avoid opinions opposed to the grace of God. For though the apostle commands us in preaching the word to be “instant in season and out of season,” <a name="fr_2834"></a><a href="#fn_2834"><font size="1">2835</font></a>
  yet we do not reckon you among the number of those to whom a word or a letter from us exhorting you carefully to avoid what is inconsistent with sound doctrine would seem “out of season.” Hence it was that you received our admonition in so kindly a manner, that, in the letter to which we are now replying, you say, “I thank you heartily for the pious advice which your Reverence gave me, not to lend an ear to those men who, by their mischievous writings, often corrupt our holy faith.”</p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXXXVIII-p10"></a>3. In this letter you go on to say, “But your Reverence knows that I and my household are entirely separated from persons of this description; and all our family follow so strictly the Catholic faith as never at any time to have wandered from it, or fallen into any heresy,—I speak not of the heresy of sects who have erred in a measure hardly admiting of expiation, but of those whose errors seem to be trivial.” This statement renders it more and more necessary for us, in writing to you, not to pass over in silence the conduct of those who are attempting to corrupt even those who are sound in the faith. We consider your house to be no insignificant Church of Christ, nor indeed is the error of those men trivial who think that we have of ourselves whatever righteousness, temperance, piety, chastity is in us, on the ground that God has so formed us, that beyond the revelation which He has given He imparts to us no further aid for performing by our own choice those things which by study we have ascertained to be our duty; declaring nature and knowledge to be the grace of God, and the only aid for living righteously and justly. For the possession, indeed, of a will inclined to what is good, whence proceed the life of uprightness and that love which so far excels all other gifts that God Himself is said to be love, and by which alone is fulfilled in us as far as we fulfil them, the divine law and council,—for the possession, I say, of such a will, they hold that we are not indebted to the aid of God, but affirm that we ourselves of our own will are sufficient for these things. Let it not appear to you a trifling error that men should wish to profess themselves Christians, and yet be unwilling to hear the apostle of Christ, who, having said, “The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts,” lest any one should think that he had this love through his own free will, immediately subjoined, “by the Holy Spirit who is given unto us.” <a name="fr_2835"></a><a href="#fn_2835"><font size="1">2836</font></a>
  Understand, then, how greatly and how fatally that man errs who does not acknowledge that this is the “great gift of the Saviour,” <a name="fr_2836"></a><a href="#fn_2836"><font size="1">2837</font></a>
  who, when He ascended on high, “led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.” <a name="fr_2837"></a><a href="#fn_2837"><font size="1">2838</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXXXVIII-p14"></a><span class="c9"><a name="vii.1.CLXXXVIII-p14.1"></a>Chap. II.</span></p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXXXVIII-p15"></a>4. How, then, could we so far conceal our true feelings as not to warn you, in whom we feel so deep an interest, to beware of such doctrines, after we had read a certain book addressed to the holy Demetrias? Whether this book has reached you, <a name="fr_2838"></a><a href="#fn_2838"><font size="1">2839</font></a>
  and who is its author, we are desirous to hear in your answer to this. In this book, were it lawful for such a one to read it, a virgin of Christ would read that her holiness and all her spiritual riches are to spring from no other source than herself, and thus, before she attains to the perfection of blessedness, she would learn,—which may God forbid!—to be ungrateful to God. For the words addressed to her in the said book are these:—“You have here, then, those things on account of which you are deservedly, nay more, more especially to be preferred before others; for your earthly rank and wealth are understood to be derived from your relatives, not from yourself, but your spiritual riches no one can have conferred on you but yourself; for these, then, you are justly to be praised, for these you are de<a name="page_550"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 550</font></a> <a name="vii.1.CLXXXVIII-Page_550"></a>servedly to be preferred to others, for they can exist only from yourself, and in yourself.” <a name="fr_2839"></a><a href="#fn_2839"><font size="1">2840</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXXXVIII-p18"></a>5. You see, doubtless, how dangerous is the doctrine in these words, against which you must be on your guard. For the affirmation, indeed, that these spiritual riches can exist only in yourself, is very well and truly said: that evidently is food; but the affirmation that they cannot exist except from you is unmixed poison. Far be it from any virgin of Christ willingly to listen to statements like these. Every virgin of Christ understands the innate poverty of the human heart, and therefore declines to have it adorned otherwise than by the gifts of her Spouse. Let her rather listen to the apostle when he says: “I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ. But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.” <a name="fr_2840"></a><a href="#fn_2840"><font size="1">2841</font></a>
  And therefore in regard to these spiritual riches let her listen, not to him who says: “No one can confer them on you except yourself, and they cannot exist except from you and in you;” but to him who says: “We have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.” <a name="fr_2841"></a><a href="#fn_2841"><font size="1">2842</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXXXVIII-p21"></a>6. In regard to that sacred virginal chastity, also, which does not belong to her from herself, but is the gift of God, bestowed, however, on her who is believing and willing, let her hear the same truthful and pious teacher, who when he treats of this subject says: “I would that all men were even as I myself: but every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.” <a name="fr_2842"></a><a href="#fn_2842"><font size="1">2843</font></a>
  Let her hear also Him who is the only Spouse, not only of herself, but of the whole Church, thus speaking of this chastity and purity: “All cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given;” <a name="fr_2843"></a><a href="#fn_2843"><font size="1">2844</font></a>
  that she may understand that for her possession of this so great and excellent gift, she ought rather to render thanks to our God and Lord, than to listen to the words of any one who says that she possessed it from herself,—words which we may not designate as those of a flatterer seeking to please, lest we seem to judge rashly concerning the hidden thoughts of men, but which are assuredly those of a misguided eulogist. For “every good gift and every perfect gift,” as the Apostle James says, “is from above, and cometh down from the Father of Lights;” <a name="fr_2844"></a><a href="#fn_2844"><font size="1">2845</font></a>
  from this source, therefore, cometh this holy virginity, in which you who approve of it, and rejoice in it, have been excelled by your daughter, who, coming after you in birth, has gone before you in conduct; descended from you in lineage, has risen above you in honour; following you in age, has gone beyond you in holiness; in whom also that begins to be yours which could not be in your own person. For she did not contract an earthly marriage, that she might be, not for herself only, but also for you, spiritually enriched, in a higher degree than yourself, since you, even with this addition, are inferior to her, because you contracted the marriage of which she is the offspring. These things are gifts of God, and are yours, indeed, but are not from yourselves; for you have this treasure in earthly bodies, which are still frail as the vessels of the potter, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of you. And be not surprised because we say that these things are yours, and not from you, for we speak of “daily bread” as ours, but yet add, <a name="fr_2845"></a><a href="#fn_2845"><font size="1">2846</font></a>
  “give it to us,” lest it should be thought that it was from ourselves.</p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXXXVIII-p26"></a>7. Wherefore obey the precept of Scripture, “Pray without ceasing. In everything give thanks;” <a name="fr_2846"></a><a href="#fn_2846"><font size="1">2847</font></a>
  for you pray in order that you may have constantly and increasingly these gifts, you render thanks because you have them not of yourself. For who separates you from that mass of death and perdition derived from Adam? Is it not He “who came to seek and to save that which was lost?” <a name="fr_2847"></a><a href="#fn_2847"><font size="1">2848</font></a>
  Was, then, a man, indeed, on hearing the apostles question, “Who maketh thee to differ?” to reply, “My own good will, my faith, my righteousness,” and to disregard what immediately follows? “What hast thou that thou didst not receive? Now, if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it?” <a name="fr_2848"></a><a href="#fn_2848"><font size="1">2849</font></a>
  We are unwilling, then, yea, utterly unwilling, that a consecrated virgin, when she hears or reads these words: “Your spiritual riches no one can have conferred on you; for these you are justly to be praised, for these you are deservedly to be preferred to others, for they can exist only from yourself, and in yourself,” should thus boast of her riches as if she had not received them. Let her say, indeed, “In me are Thy vows, O God, I will render praises unto Thee;” <a name="fr_2849"></a><a href="#fn_2849"><font size="1">2850</font></a>
  but since they are <i>in</i> her, not <i>from</i> her, let her remember also to say, “Lord, by Thy will Thou hast furnished strength to my beauty,” <a name="fr_2850"></a><a href="#fn_2850"><font size="1">2851</font></a>
  because, though it be from her, inasmuch as it is the acting of her own will, without which we cannot do what is good, yet we are not to say, as he said, that it is “only from her.” For our own will, unless it be aided by the grace <a name="page_551"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 551</font></a> <a name="vii.1.CLXXXVIII-Page_551"></a>of God, cannot alone be even in name good will, for, says the apostle, “it is God who worketh in us, both to will, and to do according to good will,” <a name="fr_2851"></a><a href="#fn_2851"><font size="1">2852</font></a>
 —not, as these persons think, merely by revealing knowledge, that we may know what we ought to do, but also by inspiring Christian love, that we may also by choice perform the things which by study we have learned.</p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXXXVIII-p33"></a>8. For doubtless the value of the gift of continence was known to him who said, “I perceived that no man can be continent unless God bestowed the gift.” He not only knew then how great a benefit it was, and how eagerly it ought to be coveted, but also that, unless God gave it, it could not exist; for wisdom had taught him this for he says, “This also was a point of wisdom, to know whose gift it was; and the knowledge did not suffice him, but he says, “I went to the Lord and made my supplication to Him.” <a name="fr_2852"></a><a href="#fn_2852"><font size="1">2853</font></a>
  God then aids us in this matter, not only by making us know what is to be done, but also by making us do through love what we already know through learning. No one, therefore, can possess, not only knowledge, but also continence, unless God give it to him. Whence it was that when he had knowledge he prayed that he might have continence, that it might be in him, because he knew that it was not from him; or if on account of the freedom of his will it was in a certain sense from himself, yet it was not from himself alone, because no one can be continent unless God bestow on him the gift. But he whose opinions I am censuring, in speaking of spiritual riches, among which is doubtless that bright and beautiful gift of continence, does not say that they may exist in you, and from yourself, but says that they can exist <i> only</i> from you, and in you, in such a way that, as a virgin of Christ has these things nowhere else than in herself, so it can be believed possible for her to have them from no other source than from herself, and in this way (which may a merciful God avert from her heart!) she shall so boast as if she had not received them!</p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXXXVIII-p35"></a><span class="c9"><a name="vii.1.CLXXXVIII-p35.1"></a>Chap. III.</span></p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXXXVIII-p36"></a>9. We indeed hold such an opinion concerning the training of this holy virgin, and the Christian humility in which she was nourished and brought up, as to be assured that when she read these words, if she did read, them, she would break out into lamentations, and humbly smite her breast, and perhaps burst into tears, and pray in faith to the Lord to whose service she was dedicated and by whom she was sanctified, pleading with Him that these were not her own words, but anothers, and asking that her faith might not be such as to believe that she had anything whereof to glory in herself and not in the Lord. For her glory is in herself, not in the words of another, as the apostle says: “Let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have glory (rejoicing) in himself alone, and not in another.” <a name="fr_2853"></a><a href="#fn_2853"><font size="1">2854</font></a>
  But God forbid that her glory should be in herself, and not in Him to whom the Psalmist says, “Thou art my glory, and the lifter up of mine head.” <a name="fr_2854"></a><a href="#fn_2854"><font size="1">2855</font></a>
  For her glory is then profitably in herself, when God, who is in her, is Himself her glory, from whom she has every good, by which she is good, and shall have all things by which she shall be made better, in as far as she may become better in this life, and by which she shall be made perfect when rendered so by divine grace, not by human praise. “For her soul shall be praised in the Lord,” <a name="fr_2855"></a><a href="#fn_2855"><font size="1">2856</font></a>
  “who satisfieth her desire with good things,” <a name="fr_2856"></a><a href="#fn_2856"><font size="1">2857</font></a>
  because He Himself has inspired this desire, that His virgin should not boast of any good, as if she had not received it.</p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXXXVIII-p41"></a>10. Inform us, then, in reply to this letter, whether we have judged truly in supposing these to be your daughters sentiments. For we know well that you and all your family are, and have been, worshippers of the indivisible Trinity. But human error insinuates itself in other forms than in erroneous opinions concerning the indivisible Trinity. There are other subjects also, in regard to which men fall into very dangerous errors. As, for example, that of which we have spoken in this letter at greater length, perhaps, than might have sufficed to a person of your stedfast and pure wisdom. And yet we know not to whom, except to God, and therefore to the Trinity, wrong is done by the man who denies that the good that comes from God is from God; which evil may God avert from you, as we believe He does! May God altogether forbid that the book out of which we have thought it our duty to extract some words, that they might be more easily understood, should produce any such impression, we do not say on your mind, or on that of the holy virgin your daughter, but on the mind of the least deserving of your male or female servants.</p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXXXVIII-p42"></a>11. But if you study more carefully even those words in which the writer appears to speak in favour of grace or the aid of God, you will find them so ambiguous that they may have reference either to nature or to knowledge, or to forgiveness of sins. For even in regard to that which they are forced to acknowledge, that we ought to pray that we may not enter into temptation, they may consider that the words mean that we are so far helped to it that, by our praying and knocking, the knowledge of the truth <a name="page_552"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 552</font></a> <a name="vii.1.CLXXXVIII-Page_552"></a>is so revealed to us that we may learn what it is our duty to do, not so far as that our will receives strength, whereby we may do that which we learn to be our duty; and as to their saying that it is by the grace or help of God that the Lord Christ has been set before us as an example of holy living, they interpret this so as to teach the same doctrine, affirming, namely, that we learn by His example how we ought to live, but denying that we are so aided as to do through love what we know by learning.</p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXXXVIII-p43"></a>12. Find in this book, if you can, anything in which, excepting nature and the freedom of the will (which pertains to the same nature), and the remission of sin and the revealing of doctrine, any such aid of God is acknowledged as that which he acknowledges who said: “When I perceived that no man can be continent unless God bestow the gift, and that this also is a point of wisdom to know whose gift it is, I went to the Lord, and made my supplication to Him.” <a name="fr_2857"></a><a href="#fn_2857"><font size="1">2858</font></a>
  For he did not desire to receive, in answer to his prayer, the nature in which he was made; nor was he solicitous to obtain the natural freedom of the will with which he was made; nor did he crave the remission of sins, seeing that he prayed rather for continence, that he might not sin; nor did he desire to know what he ought to do, seeing that he already confessed that he knew whose gift this continence was; but he wished to receive from the Spirit of wisdom such strength of will, such ardour of love, as should suffice for fully practising the great virtue of continence. If, therefore, you succeed in finding any such statement in that book, we will heartily thank you if, in your answer, you deign to inform us of it.</p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXXXVIII-p45"></a>13. It is impossible for us to tell how greatly we desire to find in the writings of these men, whose works are read by very many for their pungency and eloquence, the open confession of that grace which the apostle vehemently commends, who says that “God has given to every man the measure of faith,” <a name="fr_2858"></a><a href="#fn_2858"><font size="1">2859</font></a>
  “without which it is impossible to please God,” <a name="fr_2859"></a><a href="#fn_2859"><font size="1">2860</font></a>
  “by which the just live,” <a name="fr_2860"></a><a href="#fn_2860"><font size="1">2861</font></a>
  “which worketh by love,” <a name="fr_2861"></a><a href="#fn_2861"><font size="1">2862</font></a>
  before which and without which no works of any man are in any respect to be reckoned good, since “whatsoever is not of faith is sin.” <a name="fr_2862"></a><a href="#fn_2862"><font size="1">2863</font></a>
  He affirms that God distributes to every man, <a name="fr_2863"></a><a href="#fn_2863"><font size="1">2864</font></a>
  and that we receive divine assistance to live piously and justly, not only by the revelation of that knowledge which without charity “puffeth up,” <a name="fr_2864"></a><a href="#fn_2864"><font size="1">2865</font></a>
  but by our being inspired with that “love which is the fulfilling of the law,” <a name="fr_2865"></a><a href="#fn_2865"><font size="1">2866</font></a>
  and which so edifies our heart that knowledge does not puff it up. But hitherto I have failed to find any such statements in the writings of these men.</p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXXXVIII-p54"></a>14. But especially we should wish that these sentiments should be found in that book from which we have quoted the words in which the author, praising a virgin of Christ as if no one except herself could confer on her spiritual riches, and as if these could not exist except from herself, does not wish her to glory in the Lord, but to glory as if she had not received them. In this book, though it contain neither his name nor your own honoured name, he nevertheless mentions that a request had been made to him by the mother of the virgin to write to her. In a certain epistle of his, however, to which he openly attaches his name, and does not conceal the name of the sacred virgin, the same Pelagius says that he had written to her, and endeavours to prove, by appealing to the said work, that he most openly confessed the grace of God, which he is alleged to have passed over in silence, or denied. But we beg you to condescend to inform us, in your reply, whether that be the very book in which he has inserted these words about spiritual riches, and whether it has reached your Holiness.</p>
