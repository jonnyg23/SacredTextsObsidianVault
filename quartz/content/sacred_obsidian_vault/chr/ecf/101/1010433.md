 <p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CXLVI-p4"></a>I thank you very much for your consideration in making me glad by a letter from you, and informing me of your welfare. May the Lord recompense you with those blessings by the possession of which you may be good for ever, and may live eternally with Him who is eternal, my lord greatly beloved, and brother greatly longed for. Although I do not acknowledge that anything in me deserves the eulogies which the letter of your Benevolence contains concerning me, nevertheless I cannot but be grateful for the goodwill therein manifested towards one so insignificant, while suggesting at the same time that you should rather pray for me that I may be made by the Lord such as you suppose me already to be.</p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CXLVI-p5"></a>(<i>In another hand</i>) May you enjoy safety and the Lords favour, and be mindful of us! <a name="fr_2612"></a><a href="#fn_2612"><font size="1">2613</font></a>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="vii.1.CXLVI-p6"></a> Pelagius made use of this letter at the Council of Diospolis, in <span class="c9"><a name="vii.1.CXLVI-p6.1"></a>A.D.</span> 415, which compelled Augustin to vindicate himself in reference to it in his narrative of the proceedings of Pelagius.
