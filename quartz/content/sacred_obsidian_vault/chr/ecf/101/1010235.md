 <p class="c10"><a name="vi.XII.II-p2"></a>2. The weakness of my tongue confesseth unto Thy Highness, seeing that Thou madest heaven and earth. This heaven which I see, and this earth upon which I tread (from which is this earth that I carry about me), Thou hast made. But where is that heaven of heavens, <a name="fr_1071"></a><a href="#fn_1071"><font size="1">1072</font></a>
  O Lord, of which we hear in the words of the Psalm, The heaven of heavens are the Lords, but the earth hath He given to the children of men? <a name="fr_1072"></a><a href="#fn_1072"><font size="1">1073</font></a>
  Where is the heaven, which we behold not, in comparison of which all this, which we behold, is earth? For this corporeal whole, not as a whole everywhere, hath thus received its beautiful figure in these lower parts, of which the bottom is our earth; but compared with that heaven of heavens, even the heaven of our earth is but earth; yea, each of these great bodies is not absurdly called earth, as compared with that, I know not what manner of heaven, which is the Lords, not the sons of men.</p>
