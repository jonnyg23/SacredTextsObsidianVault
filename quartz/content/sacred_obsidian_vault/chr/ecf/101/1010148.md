 <p class="c10"><a name="vi.IX.V-p2"></a>13. The vintage vacation being ended, I gave the citizens of Milan notice that they might provide their scholars with another seller of words; because both of my election to serve Thee, and my inability, by reason of the difficulty of breathing and the pain in my chest, to continue the Professorship. And by letters I notified to Thy bishop, <a name="fr_750"></a><a href="#fn_750"><font size="1">751</font></a>
  the holy man Ambrose, my former errors and present resolutions, with a view to his advising me which of Thy books it was best for me to read, so that I might be readier and fitter for the reception of such great grace. He recommended Isaiah the Prophet; <a name="fr_751"></a><a href="#fn_751"><font size="1">752</font></a>

But I, not understanding the first portion of the book, and imagining the whole to be like it, laid it aside, intending to take it up hereafter, when better practised in our Lords words.</p>
