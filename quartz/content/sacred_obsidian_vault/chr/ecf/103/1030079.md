 </p><p class="c39"><a name="iv.i.vii.ii-p1"></a>  <span class="c2"><a name="iv.i.vii.ii-p1.1"></a>Chapter 2.—God the Only Unchangeable Essence.</span></p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="iv.i.vii.ii-p2"></a>3. He is, however, without doubt, a substance, or, if it be better so to call it, an essence, which the Greeks call  <span class="Greek"><a name="iv.i.vii.ii-p2.1"></a>οὐσία</span>. For as wisdom is so called from the being wise, and knowledge from knowing; so from being <a name="fr_565"></a><a href="#fn_565"><font size="1">566</font></a>
  comes that which we call essence. And who is there that is, more than He who said to His servant Moses, “I am that I am;” and, “Thus shall thou say unto the children of Israel, He who is hath sent me unto you?” <a name="fr_566"></a><a href="#fn_566"><font size="1">567</font></a>
  But other things that are called essences or substances admit of accidents, whereby a change, whether great or small, is produced in them. But there can be no accident of this kind in respect to God; and therefore He who is God is the only unchangeable substance or essence, to whom certainly <span class="c19"><a name="iv.i.vii.ii-p4.3"></a>being</span> itself, whence comes the name of essence, most especially and most truly belongs. For that which is changed does not retain its own being; and that which can be changed, although it be not actually changed, is able not to be that which it had been; and hence that which not only is not changed, but also cannot at all be changed, alone falls most truly, without difficulty or hesitation, under the category of <span class="c19"><a name="iv.i.vii.ii-p4.4"></a>being</span>.</p>
