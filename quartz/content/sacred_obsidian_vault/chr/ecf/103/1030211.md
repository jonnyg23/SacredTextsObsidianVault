 </p><p class="c39"><a name="iv.i.xvi.xii-p1"></a>  <span class="c2"><a name="iv.i.xvi.xii-p1.1"></a>Chapter 12.—The Trinity in the Mind is the Image of God, in that It Remembers, Understands, and Loves God, Which to Do is Wisdom.</span></p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="iv.i.xvi.xii-p2"></a>15. This trinity, then, of the mind is not therefore the image of God, because the mind remembers itself, and understands and loves itself; but because it can also remember, understand, and love Him by whom it was made. And in so doing it is made wise itself. But if it does not do so, even when it remembers, understands, and loves itself, then it is foolish. Let it then remember its God, after whose image it is made, and let it understand and love Him. Or to say the same thing more briefly, let it worship God, who is not made, by whom because itself was made, it is capable and can be partaker of Him; wherefore it is written, “Behold, the worship of God, that is wisdom.” <a name="fr_881"></a><a href="#fn_881"><font size="1">882</font></a>
  And then it will be wise, not by its own light, but by participation of that supreme Light; and wherein it is eternal, therein shall reign in blessedness. For this wisdom of man is so called, in that it is also of God. For then it is true wisdom; for if it is human, it is vain. Yet not so of God, as is that wherewith God is wise. For He is not wise by partaking of Himself, as the mind is by partaking of God. But as we call it the righteousness of God, not only when we speak of that by which He Himself is righteous, but also of that which He gives to man when He justifies the ungodly, which latter righteousness the apostle commending, says of some, that “not knowing the righteousness of God and going about to establish their own righteousness,they are not subject to the righteousness of God;” <a name="fr_882"></a><a href="#fn_882"><font size="1">883</font></a>
  so also it may be said of some, that not knowing the wisdom of God <a name="page_192"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 192</font></a> <a name="iv.i.xvi.xii-Page_192"></a>and going about to establish their own wisdom, they are not subject to the wisdom of God.</p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="iv.i.xvi.xii-p5"></a>16. There is, then, a nature not made, which made all other natures, great and small, and is without doubt more excellent than those which it has made, and therefore also than that of which we are speaking; <i>viz.</i> than the rational and intellectual nature, which is the mind of man, made after the image of Him who made it. And that nature, more excellent than the rest, is God. And indeed “He is not far from every one of us,” as the apostle says, who adds, “For in Him we live, and are moved, and have our being.” <a name="fr_883"></a><a href="#fn_883"><font size="1">884</font></a>
  And if this were said in respect to the body, it might be understood even of this corporeal world; for in it too in respect to the body, we live, and are moved, and have our being. And therefore it ought to be taken in a more excellent way, and one that is spiritual, not visible, in respect to the mind, which is made after His image. For what is there that is not in Him, of whom it is divinely written, “For of Him, and through Him, and in Him, are all things”? <a name="fr_884"></a><a href="#fn_884"><font size="1">885</font></a>
  If, then, all things are in Him, in whom can any possibly live that do live, or be moved that are moved, except in Him in whom they are? Yet all are not with Him in that way in which it is said to Him, “I am continually with Thee.” <a name="fr_885"></a><a href="#fn_885"><font size="1">886</font></a>
  Nor is He with all in that way in which we say, The Lord be with you. And so it is the especial wretchedness of man not to be with Him, without whom he cannot be. For, beyond a doubt, he is not without Him in whom he is; and yet if he does not remember, and understand, and love Him, he is not with Him. And when any one absolutely forgets a thing, certainly it is impossible even to remind him of it.</p>
