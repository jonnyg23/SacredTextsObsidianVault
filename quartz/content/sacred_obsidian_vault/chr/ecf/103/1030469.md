 </p><p class="c10"><a name="iv.vii.v-p1"></a>  5. The Father doeth what He will, and what He will doeth the Son. Do not imagine an Almighty Father and a not Almighty Son: it is error, blot it out within you, let it not cleave in your memory, let it not be drunk into your faith, and if haply any of you shall have drunk it in, let him vomit it up. Almighty is the Father, Almighty the Son. If Almighty begat not Almighty, He begat not very Son. For what say we, brethren, if the Father being greater begat a Son less than He? What said I, begat? Man engenders, being greater, a son being less: it is true: but that is because the one grows old, the other grows up, and by very growing attains to the form of his father. The Son of God, if He groweth not because neither can God wax old, was begotten perfect. And being begotten perfect, if He groweth not, and remained not less, He is equal. For that ye may know Almighty begotten of Almighty, hear Him Who is Truth. That which of Itself Truth saith, is true. What saith Truth? What saith the Son, Who is Truth? “Whatsoever things the Father doeth, these also the Son likewise doeth.” <a name="fr_1770"></a><a href="#fn_1770"><font size="1">1771</font></a>
  The Son is Almighty, in doing all things that He willeth to do. For if the Father doeth some things which the Son doeth not, the Son said falsely, “Whatsoever things the Father doeth, these also the Son doeth likewise.” But because the Son spake <a name="page_371"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 371</font></a> <a name="iv.vii.v-Page_371"></a>truly, believe it: “Whatsoever things the Father doeth, these also the Son doeth likewise,” and ye have believed in the Son that He is Almighty. Which word although ye said not in the Creed, yet this is it that ye expressed when ye believed in the Only Son, Himself God. Hath the Father aught that the Son hath not? This Arian heretic blasphemers say, not I. But what say I? If the Father hath aught that the Son hath not, the Son lieth in saying, “All things that the Father hath, are Mine.” <a name="fr_1771"></a><a href="#fn_1771"><font size="1">1772</font></a>
  Many and innumerable are the testimonies by which it is proved that the Son is Very Son of God the Father, and the Father God hath His Very-begotten Son God, and Father and Son is One God.</p>
