 </p><p class="c10"><a name="v.ii.ix-p1"></a>  8. “Honorable,” therefore, “is marriage in all, and the bed undefiled.” <a name="fr_1953"></a><a href="#fn_1953"><font size="1">1954</font></a>
  And this we do not so call a good, as that it is a good in comparison of fornication: otherwise there will be two evils, of which the second is worse: or fornication will also be a good, because adultery is worse: for it is worse to violate the marriage of another, than to cleave unto an harlot: and adultery will be a good, because incest is worse; for it is worse to lie with a mother than with the wife of another: and, until we arrive at those things, which, as the Apostle saith, “it is a shame even to speak of,” <a name="fr_1954"></a><a href="#fn_1954"><font size="1">1955</font></a>
  all will be good in comparison of what are worse. But who can doubt that this is false? Therefore marriage and for<a name="page_403"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 403</font></a> <a name="v.ii.ix-Page_403"></a>nication are not two evils, whereof the second is worse: but marriage and continence are two goods, whereof the second is better, even as this temporal health and sickness are not two evils, whereof the second is worse; but that health and immortality are two goods, whereof the second is better. Also knowledge and vanity are not two evils, whereof vanity is the worse: but knowledge and charity are two goods, whereof charity is the better. For “knowledge shall be destroyed,” <a name="fr_1955"></a><a href="#fn_1955"><font size="1">1956</font></a>
  saith the Apostle: and yet it is necessary for this time: but “charity shall never fail.” Thus also this mortal begetting, on account of which marriage takes place, shall be destroyed: but freedom from all sexual intercourse is both angelic exercise <a name="fr_1956"></a><a href="#fn_1956"><font size="1">1957</font></a>
  here, and continueth for ever. But as the repasts of the Just are better than the fasts of the sacrilegious, so the marriage of the faithful is to be set before the virginity of the impious. However neither in that case is repast preferred to fasting, but righteousness to sacrilege; nor in this, marriage to virginity, but faith to impiety. For for this end the righteous, when need is, take their repast, that, as good masters, they may give to their slaves, <i>i.e.,</i> their bodies, what is just and fair: but for this end the sacrilegious fast, that they may serve devils. Thus for this end the faithful are married, that they may be chastely joined unto husbands, but for this end the impious are virgins, that they may commit fornication away from the true God. As, therefore, that was good, which Martha was doing, being engaged in the ministering unto the Saints, but that better, which Mary, her sister, sitting at the feet of the Lord, and hearing His word; thus we praise the good of Susanna <a name="fr_1957"></a><a href="#fn_1957"><font size="1">1958</font></a>
  in married chastity, but yet we set before her the good of the widow Anna, <a name="fr_1958"></a><a href="#fn_1958"><font size="1">1959</font></a>
  and, much more, of the Virgin Mary. <a name="fr_1959"></a><a href="#fn_1959"><font size="1">1960</font></a>
  It was good that they were doing, who of their substance were ministering necessaries unto Christ and His disciples: but better, who left all their substance, that they might be freer to follow the same Lord. But in both these cases of good, whether what these, or whether what Martha and Mary were doing, the better could not be done, unless the other had been passed over or left. Whence we are to understand, that we are not, on this account, to think marriage an evil, because, unless there be abstinence from it, widowed chastity, or virgin purity, cannot be had. For neither on this account was what Martha was doing evil, because, unless her sister abstained from it, she could not do what was better: nor on this account is it evil to receive a just man or a prophet into ones house, because he, who wills to follow Christ unto perfection, ought not even to have a house, in order to do what is better.</p>
