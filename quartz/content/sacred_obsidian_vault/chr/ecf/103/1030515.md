 </p><p class="c10"><a name="v.i.xxxii-p1"></a>  32. But whether keenly contending, that we be not overcome, or overcoming divers times, or even with unhoped and unlooked for ease, let us give the glory unto Him Who giveth continence unto us. Let us remember that a certain just man said, “I shall never be moved:” and that it was showed him how rashly he had said this, attributing as though to his own strength, what was given to him from above. But this we have learnt from his own confession: for soon after he added, “Lord, in Thy will Thou hast given strength to my beauty; but Thou hast turned away Thy Face, and I was troubled.” <a name="fr_1930"></a><a href="#fn_1930"><font size="1">1931</font></a>
  Through a remedial Providence he was for a short time deserted by his Ruler, in order that he might not himself through deadly pride desert his Ruler. Therefore, whether here, where we engage with our faults in order to subdue and make them less, or there, as it shall be in the end, where we shall be void of every enemy, because of all infection, <a name="fr_1931"></a><a href="#fn_1931"><font size="1">1932</font></a>
  it is for our health that we are thus dealt with, in order that, “whoso glorieth, he may glory in the Lord.” <a name="fr_1932"></a><a href="#fn_1932"><font size="1">1933</font></a>
