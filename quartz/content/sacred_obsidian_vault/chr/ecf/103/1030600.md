 </p><p class="c10"><a name="v.iii.xlvii-p1"></a>  46. But this is so great, that certain understand it to be the fruit an hundred-fold. <a name="fr_2189"></a><a href="#fn_2189"><font size="1">2190</font></a>
  For the authority of the Church bears a very conspicuous witness, in which it is known to the faithful in what place the Martyrs, in what place the holy nuns deceased, are rehearsed at the Sacraments of the Altar. <a name="fr_2190"></a><a href="#fn_2190"><font size="1">2191</font></a>
  But what the meaning is of that difference of fruitfulness, let them see to it, who understand these things better than we; whether the virginal life be in fruit an hundred-fold, in sixty-fold the widowed, in thirty-fold the married; or whether the hundred-fold fruitfulness be ascribed unto martyrdom, the sixty-fold unto continence, the thirty-fold unto marriage; or whether virginity, by the addition of martyrdom, fill up the hundred-fold, but when alone be in sixty-fold, but married persons bearing thirty-fold arrive at sixty-fold, in case they shall be martyrs: or whether, what seems to me more probable, forasmuch as the gifts of Divine grace are many, and one is greater and better than another, whence the Apostle says, “But emulate ye the better gifts;” <a name="fr_2191"></a><a href="#fn_2191"><font size="1">2192</font></a>
  we are to understand that they are more in number than to allow of being distributed under those different kinds. In the first place, that we set not widowed continence either as bearing no fruit, or set it but level with the desert of married charity, or equal it unto virgin glory; or think that the Crown of Martyrdom, either established in habit of mind, although proof of trial be wanting, or in actual making trial of suffering, be added unto either one of those these chastities, without any increase of fruitfulness. Next, when we set it down that many men and women so keep virginal chastity, as that yet they do not the things which the Lord saith, “If thou willest to be perfect, go, sell all that thou hast, and give unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in Heaven: and come, follow me;” <a name="fr_2192"></a><a href="#fn_2192"><font size="1">2193</font></a>
  and dare not unite themselves to those dwelling together, among whom no one saith that any thing is his own, but all things are unto them common; <a name="fr_2193"></a><a href="#fn_2193"><font size="1">2194</font></a>
  do we think that there is no addition of fruitfulness unto the virgins of God, when they do this? or that the virgins of God are without any fruit, although they do not this? Therefore there are many gifts, and some brighter and higher than others, each than each. And at times one is fruitful in fewer gifts, but better; another in lower gifts, but more. And in what manner they be either made equal one to another, or distinguished one from another, in receiving eternal honors, who of men would dare to pronounce? whereas yet it is plain both that those differences are many, and that the better are profitable not for the present time, but for eternity. But I judge that the Lord willed to make mention of three differences <a name="page_435"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 435</font></a> <a name="v.iii.xlvii-Page_435"></a>of fruitfulness, the rest He left to such as understand. <a name="fr_2194"></a><a href="#fn_2194"><font size="1">2195</font></a>
  For also another Evangelist hath made mention only of the hundred-fold: <a name="fr_2195"></a><a href="#fn_2195"><font size="1">2196</font></a>
  we are not, therefore, are we, to think that he either rejected, or knew not of, the other two, but rather that he left them to be understood?</p>
