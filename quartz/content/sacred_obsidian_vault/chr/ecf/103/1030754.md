 </p><p class="c10"><a name="v.vii.xxiii-p1"></a>  22. There also is said at what work the Apostle wrought. “After these things,” it says, “he departed from Athens and came to Corinth; and having found a certain Jew, by name Aquila, of Pontus by birth, lately come from Italy, and Priscilla his wife, because that Claudius had ordered all Jews to depart from Rome, he came unto them, and because he was of the same craft he abode with them, doing work: for they were tent-makers.” <a name="fr_2548"></a><a href="#fn_2548"><font size="1">2549</font></a>
  This if they shall essay to interpret allegorically, they show what proficients they be in ecclesiastical learning, on which they glory that they bestow all their time. And, at the least, touching those sayings above recited, “Or I only and Barnabas, have we not power to forbear working?” and, “We have not used this power;” <a name="fr_2549"></a><a href="#fn_2549"><font size="1">2550</font></a>
  and, “When we might be burdensome to you, as Apostles of Christ,” <a name="fr_2550"></a><a href="#fn_2550"><font size="1">2551</font></a>
  and, “Night and day working that we might not burden any of you;” <a name="fr_2551"></a><a href="#fn_2551"><font size="1">2552</font></a>
  and, “The Lord hath ordained for them which preach the Gospel, of the Gospel to live; but I have used none of these things:” <a name="fr_2552"></a><a href="#fn_2552"><font size="1">2553</font></a>
  and the rest of this kind, let them either expound otherwise, or if by most clear shining light of truth they be put to it, let them understand and obey; or if to obey they be either unwilling or unable, at least let them own them which be willing, to be better, and them which be also able, to be happier men than they. For it is one thing to plead infirmity of body, either truly alleged, or falsely pretended: but another so to be deceived and so to deceive, that it shall even be thought a proof of righteousness obtaining more mightily in servants of God, if laziness have gotten power to reign among a set of ignorant men. He, namely, who shows a true infirmity of body, must be humanely dealt withal; he who pretends a false one, and cannot be convicted, must be left unto God: yet neither of them fixeth a pernicious rule; because a good servant of God both serves his manifestly infirm brother; and, when the other deceives, if he believes him because he does not think him a bad man, he does not imitate him that he may be bad; and if he believe him not; he thinks him deceitful, and does, nevertheless, not imitate him. But when a man says, “This is true righteousness, that by doing no bodily work we imitate the birds of the air, because he who shall do any such work, goes against the Gospel:” whoso being infirm in mind hears and believes this, that person, not for that he so bestows all his time, but for that he so erreth, must be mourned over.</p>
