 </p><p class="c49"><a name="x.ii.ii.xix-p1"></a>  XVIII. <i>That our irrational passions have their rise from kindred with irrational nature.</i> <a name="fr_1663"></a><a href="#fn_1663"><font size="1">1665</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c12"><a name="x.ii.ii.xix-p3"></a>1. For I think that from this beginning all our passions issue as from a spring, and pour their flood over mans life; and an evidence of my words is the kinship of passions which appears alike in ourselves and in the brutes; for it is not allowable to ascribe the first beginnings of our constitutional liability to passion to that human nature which was fashioned in the Divine likeness; but as brute life first entered into the world, and man, for the reason already mentioned, took something of their nature (I mean the mode of generation), he accordingly took at the same time a share of the other <a name="page_408"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 408</font></a> <a name="x.ii.ii.xix-Page_408"></a>attributes contemplated in that nature; for the likeness of man to God is not found in anger, nor is pleasure a mark of the superior nature; cowardice also, and boldness, and the desire of gain, and the dislike of loss, and all the like, are far removed from that stamp which indicates Divinity.</p>  
 <p class="c14"><a name="x.ii.ii.xix-p4"></a>2. These attributes, then, human nature took to itself from the side of the brutes; for those qualities with which brute life was armed for self-preservation, when transferred to human life, became passions; for the carnivorous animals are preserved by their anger, and those which breed largely by their love of pleasure; cowardice preserves the weak, fear that which is easily taken by more powerful animals, and greediness those of great bulk; and to miss anything that tends to pleasure is for the brutes a matter of pain. All these and the like affections entered mans composition by reason of the animal mode of generation.</p>  
 <p class="c14"><a name="x.ii.ii.xix-p5"></a>3. I may be allowed to describe the human image by comparison with some wonderful piece of modelling. For, as one may see in models those carved <a name="fr_1664"></a><a href="#fn_1664"><font size="1">1666</font></a>
  shapes which the artificers of such things contrive for the wonder of beholders, tracing out upon a single head two forms of faces; so man seems to me to bear a double likeness to opposite things—being moulded in the Divine element of his mind to the Divine beauty, but bearing, in the passionate impulses that arise in him, a likeness to the brute nature; while often even his reason is rendered brutish, and obscures the better element by the worse through its inclination and disposition towards what is irrational; for whenever a man drags down his mental energy to these affections, and forces his reason to become the servant of his passions, there takes place a sort of conversion of the good stamp in him into the irrational image, his whole nature being traced anew after that design, as his reason, so to say, cultivates the beginnings of his passions, and gradually multiplies them; for once it lends its co-operation to passion, it produces a plenteous and abundant crop of evils.</p>  
 <p class="c14"><a name="x.ii.ii.xix-p7"></a>4. Thus our love of pleasure took its beginning from our being made like to the irrational creation, and was increased by the transgressions of men, becoming the parent of so many varieties of sins arising from pleasure as we cannot find among the irrational animals. Thus the rising of anger in us is indeed akin to the impulse of the brutes; but it grows by the alliance of thought: for thence come malignity, envy, deceit, conspiracy, hypocrisy; all these are the result of the evil husbandry of the mind; for if the passion were divested of the aid it receives from thought, the anger that is left behind is short-lived and not sustained, like a bubble, perishing straightway as soon as it comes into being. Thus the greediness of swine introduces covetousness, and the high spirit of the horse becomes the origin of pride; and all the particular forms that proceed from the want of reason in brute nature become vice by the evil use of the mind.</p>  
 <p class="c14"><a name="x.ii.ii.xix-p8"></a>5. So, likewise, on the contrary, if reason instead assumes sway over such emotions, each of them is transmuted to a form of virtue; for anger produces courage, terror caution, fear obedience, hatred aversion from vice, the power of love the desire for what is truly beautiful; high spirit in our character raises our thought above the passions, and keeps it from bondage to what is base; yea, the great Apostle, even, praises such a form of mental elevation when he bids us constantly to “think those things that are above <a name="fr_1665"></a><a href="#fn_1665"><font size="1">1667</font></a>
 ;” and so we find that every such motion, when elevated by loftiness of mind, is conformed to the beauty of the Divine image.</p>  
 <p class="c14"><a name="x.ii.ii.xix-p10"></a>6. But the other impulse is greater, as the tendency of sin is heavy and downward; for the ruling element of our soul is more inclined to be dragged downwards by the weight of the irrational nature than is the heavy and earthy element to be exalted by the loftiness of the intellect; hence the misery that encompasses us often causes the Divine gift to be forgotten, and spreads the passions of the flesh, like some ugly mask, over the beauty of the image.</p>  
 <p class="c14"><a name="x.ii.ii.xix-p11"></a>7. Those, therefore, are in some sense excusable, who do not admit, when they look upon such cases, that the Divine form is there; yet we may behold the Divine image in men by the medium of those who have ordered their lives aright. For if the man who is subject to passion, and carnal, makes it incredible that man was adorned, as it were, with Divine beauty, surely the man of lofty virtue and pure from pollution will confirm you in the better conception of human nature.</p>  
 <p class="c14"><a name="x.ii.ii.xix-p12"></a>8. For instance (for it is better to make our argument clear by an illustration), one of those noted for wickedness—some Jechoniah, say, or some other of evil memory—has obliterated the beauty of his nature by the pollution of wickedness; yet in Moses and in men like him the form of the image was kept pure. Now where the beauty of the form has not been obscured, there is made plain the faithfulness of the saying that man is an image of God.</p>  
 <p class="c14"><a name="x.ii.ii.xix-p13"></a>9. It may be, however, that some one feels <a name="page_409"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 409</font></a> <a name="x.ii.ii.xix-Page_409"></a>shame at the fact that our life, like that of the brutes, is sustained by food, and for this reason deems man unworthy of being supposed to have been framed in the image of God; but he may expect that freedom from this function will one day be bestowed upon our nature in the life we look for; for, as the Apostle says, “the Kingdom of God is not meat and drink <a name="fr_1666"></a><a href="#fn_1666"><font size="1">1668</font></a>
 ;” and the Lord declared that “man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God <a name="fr_1667"></a><a href="#fn_1667"><font size="1">1669</font></a>
 .” Further, as the resurrection holds forth to us a life equal with the angels, and with the angels there is no food, there is sufficient ground for believing that man, who will live in like fashion with the angels, will be released from such a function.</p>
