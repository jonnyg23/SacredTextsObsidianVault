 <p class="c26"><a name="ii.iv.xxxi-p2"></a><span class="c4"><a name="ii.iv.xxxi-p2.1"></a>To Pulcheria Augusta <a name="fr_315"></a><a href="#fn_315"><font size="1">316</font></a>
 .</span></p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="ii.iv.xxxi-p4"></a>Leo to Pulcheria Augusta.</p>  
 <p class="c27"><a name="ii.iv.xxxi-p5"></a>I.  <i>He reminds Pulcheria of her former services to the Church, and suggests her interference in the Eutychian controversy.</i></p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="ii.iv.xxxi-p6"></a>How much protection the <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxxi-p6.1"></a>Lord</span> has extended to His Church through your clemency, we have often tested by many signs.  And whatever stand the strenuousness of the priesthood has made in our times against the assailers of the catholic Truth, has redounded chiefly to your glory:  seeing that, as you have learnt from the teaching of the Holy Spirit, you submit your authority in all things to Him, by whose favour and under whose protection you reign.  Wherefore, because I have ascertained from my brother and fellow-bishop Flavians report, that a certain dispute has been raised through the agency of Eutyches in the church of Constantinople against the integrity of the Christian faith (and the text of the synods minutes has shown me the exact nature of the whole matter), it is worthy of your great name that the error which in my opinion proceeds rather from ignorance than ingenuity, should be dispelled before, with the pertinacity of wrong-headedness, it gains any strength from the support of the unwise.  Because even ignorance sometimes falls into serious mistakes, and very frequently the simple-minded rush through unwariness into the devils pit:  and it is thus, I believe, that the spirit of falsehood has crept over Eutyches:  so that, whilst he imagines himself to appreciate the majesty of the Son of <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxxi-p6.2"></a>God</span> more devoutly, by denying in Him the real presence of our nature, he came to the conclusion that the whole of that Word which “became flesh” was of one and the same essence.  And greatly as Nestorius fell away from the Truth, in asserting that Christ was only born man of His mother, this man also departs no less far from the catholic path, who does not believe that our substance was brought forth from the same Virgin:  wishing it of course to be understood as belonging to His Godhead only; so that that which took the form of a slave, and was like us and of the same form <a name="fr_316"></a><a href="#fn_316"><font size="1">317</font></a>
 , was a kind of image, not the reality of our nature.</p>  
 <p class="c27"><a name="ii.iv.xxxi-p8"></a>II.  <i>Mans salvation required the union of the two natures in Christ</i>.</p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="ii.iv.xxxi-p9"></a>But it is of no avail to say that our <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxxi-p9.1"></a>Lord</span>, the Son of the blessed Virgin Mary, was true and perfect man, if He is not believed to be Man of that stock which is attributed to Him in the Gospel.  For Matthew says, “The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham <a name="fr_317"></a><a href="#fn_317"><font size="1">318</font></a>
 :”  and follows the order of His human origin, so as to bring the lines of His ancestry down to Joseph to whom the <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxxi-p10.2"></a>Lords</span> mother was espoused.  Whereas Luke going backwards step by step traces His succession to the first of the human race himself, to show that the first Adam and the last Adam were of the same nature.  No doubt the Almighty Son of <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxxi-p10.3"></a>God</span> could have appeared for the purpose  <a name="page_45"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 45</font></a> <a name="ii.iv.xxxi-Page_45"></a>of teaching, and justifying men in exactly the same way that He appeared both to patriarchs and prophets in the semblance of flesh <a name="fr_318"></a><a href="#fn_318"><font size="1">319</font></a>
 ; for instance, when He engaged in a struggle, and entered into conversation (with Jacob), or when He refused not hospitable entertainment, and even partook of the food set before Him.  But these appearances were indications of that Man whose reality it was announced by mystic predictions would be assumed from the stock of preceding patriarchs.  And the fulfilment of the mystery of our atonement, which was ordained from all eternity, was not assisted by any figures because the Holy Spirit had not yet come upon the Virgin, and the power of the Most High had not over-shadowed her:  so that “Wisdom building herself a house <a name="fr_319"></a><a href="#fn_319"><font size="1">320</font></a>
 ” within her undefiled body, “the Word became flesh;” and the form of <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxxi-p12.2"></a>God</span> and the form of a slave coming together into one person, the Creator of times was born in time; and He Himself through whom all things were made, was brought forth in the midst of all things.  For if the New Man had not been made in the likeness of sinful flesh, and taken on Him our old nature, and being consubstantial with the Father, had deigned to be consubstantial with His mother also, and being alone free from sin, had united our nature to Him the whole human race would be held in bondage beneath the Devils yoke <a name="fr_320"></a><a href="#fn_320"><font size="1">321</font></a>
 , and we should not be able to make use of the Conquerors victory, if it had been won outside our nature.</p>  
 <p class="c27"><a name="ii.iv.xxxi-p14"></a>III.  <i>From the union of the two natures flows the grace of baptism.  He makes a direct appeal to Pulcheria for her help.</i></p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="ii.iv.xxxi-p15"></a>But from Christs marvellous sharing of the two natures, the mystery of regeneration shone upon us that through the self-same spirit, through whom Christ was conceived and born, we too, who were born through the desire of the flesh, might be born again from a spiritual source:  and consequently, the Evangelist speaks of believers as those “who were born not of bloods, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxxi-p15.1"></a>God <a name="fr_321"></a><a href="#fn_321"><font size="1">322</font></a>
 </span>.”  And of this unutterable grace no one is a partaker, nor can be reckoned among the adopted sons of <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxxi-p16.2"></a>God</span>, who excludes from his faith that which is the chief means of our salvation.  Wherefore, I am much vexed and saddened that this man, who seemed before so laudably disposed towards humility, dares to make these empty and stupid attacks on the one Faith of ourselves and of our fathers.  When he saw that his ignorant notion offended the ears of catholics, he ought to have withdrawn from his opinion, and not to have so disturbed the Churchs rulers, as to deserve a sentence of condemnation:  which, of course, no one will be able to remit, if he is determined to abide by his notion.  For the moderation of the Apostolic See uses its leniency in such a way as to deal severely with the contumacious, while desiring to offer pardon to those who accept correction.  Seeing then that I possess great confidence in your lofty faith and piety, I entreat your illustrious clemency, that, as the preaching of the catholic Faith has always been aided by your holy zeal, so now, also, you will maintain its free action.  Perchance the <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxxi-p16.3"></a>Lord</span> allowed it to be thus assailed for this reason that we might discover what sort of persons lurked within the Church.  And clearly, we must not neglect to look after such, lest we be afflicted with their actual loss.</p>  
 <p class="c27"><a name="ii.iv.xxxi-p17"></a>IV.  <i>His personal presence at the council must be excused.  The question at issue is a very grave one.</i></p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="ii.iv.xxxi-p18"></a>But the most august and Christian Emperor, being anxious that the disturbances may be set at rest with all speed, has appointed too short and early a date for the council of bishops, which he wishes held at Ephesus, in fixing the first of August for the meeting:  for from the fifth of May, on which we received His Majestys letter, most of the time remaining has to be spent in making complete arrangements for the journey of such priests as are competent to represent me.  For as to the necessity of my attending the council also, which his piety suggested, even if there were any precedent for the request, it could by no means be managed now:  for the very uncertain state of things at present would not permit my absence from the people of this great city:  and the minds of the riotously-disposed might be driven to desperate deeds, if they were to think that I took occasion of ecclesiastical business to desert my country <a name="fr_322"></a><a href="#fn_322"><font size="1">323</font></a>
  and the Apostolic See.  As then you recognize that it concerns the public weal that with your merciful indulgence I should not deny myself to the affectionate prayers of my  <a name="page_46"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 46</font></a> <a name="ii.iv.xxxi-Page_46"></a>people, consider that in these my brethren, whom I have sent in my stead, I also am present with the rest who appear:  to them I have clearly and fully explained what is to be maintained in view of the satisfactory exposition of the case which has been given me by the detailed report, and by the defendants own statement to me.  For the question is not about some small portion of our Faith on which no very distinct declaration has been made:  but the foolish opposition that is raised ventures to impugn that which our <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxxi-p19.1"></a>Lord</span> desired no one of either sex in the Church to be ignorant of.  For the short but complete confession of the catholic creed which contains the twelve sentences of the twelve apostles <a name="fr_323"></a><a href="#fn_323"><font size="1">324</font></a>
  is so well furnished with the heavenly panoply, that all the opinions of heretics can receive their death-blow from that one weapon.  And if Eutyches had been content to receive that creed in its entirety with a pure and simple heart, he would at no point go astray from the decrees of the most sacred council of Nicæa, and he would understand that the holy Fathers laid this down, to the end that no mental or rhetorical ingenuity should lift itself up against the Apostolic Faith which is absolutely one.  Deign then, with your accustomed piety to do your best endeavour, that this blasphemous and foolish attack upon the one and only sacrament of mans salvation may be driven from all mens minds.  And if the man himself, who has fallen into this temptation, recover his senses, so as to condemn his own error by a written recantation, let him not be denied communion with his order <a name="fr_324"></a><a href="#fn_324"><font size="1">325</font></a>
 .  Your clemency is to know that I have written in the same strain to the holy bishop Flavian also:  that loving-kindness be not lost sight of, if the error be dispelled.  Dated 13 June in the consulship of the illustrious Asturius and Protogenes (449).</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="ii.iv.xxxi-p3"></a> This was the Emperor Theodosius the youngers sister, a woman of noted zeal in the cause of the Church:  for many years she had practically ruled the empire owing to her brothers youthfulness.  When the intrigues of Chrysaphius had brought about a quarrel between brother and sister, she retired for a time from public life.  But becoming the virgin wife of Marcian, she, through him, helped to effect the victory of the Catholic cause at the Council of Chalcedon (451).</p>
