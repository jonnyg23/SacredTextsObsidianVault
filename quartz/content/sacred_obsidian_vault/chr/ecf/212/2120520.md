 </p><p class="c27"><a name="iii.v.vi.xxxiv-p1"></a> <span class="c1"><a name="iii.v.vi.xxxiv-p1.1"></a>Epistle LIII.</span></p>  
 <p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.vi.xxxiv-p2"></a>To Virgilius, Bishop.</p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.vi.xxxiv-p3"></a>Gregory to Virgilius, Bishop of Arelate (<i>Arles</i>), Metropolitan.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.vi.xxxiv-p4"></a>Although we are confident that your Fraternity is intent on good works, and that you come forward of your own accord in causes well-pleasing to <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.xxxiv-p4.1"></a>God</span>, we nevertheless deem it advantageous to address you with fraternal charity, that, being provoked also by our letters, you may increase the solace which it becomes you voluntarily to bestow.  And accordingly we inform your Holiness that we have sent Augustine, the servant of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.xxxiv-p4.2"></a>God</span>, the bearer of these presents, with other servants of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.xxxiv-p4.3"></a>God</span>, for the winning of souls in the parts whither he is going, as he will be able himself to inform you face to face.  In these circumstances you must needs aid him with prayer and assistance, and, where need may require, afford him the support of your succour, and refresh him, as is fit, with fatherly and priestly consolation, to the end that, when he shall have obtained the succour of your Holiness, if he should succeed in winning any gain for <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.xxxiv-p4.4"></a>God</span>, as we hope he may, you too may be able to gain a reward along with him, having devoutly administered to his good works the abundance of your support.  Moreover, as to Candidus the presbyter, our common son, and the little patrimony of our Church, let your Fraternity, as being of one mind with us, study to hold both as commended to you; that so, with the help of your Holiness, something may thence accrue for the sustenance of the poor.  Inasmuch, then, as your predecessor held this patrimony for many years, and   <a name="page_204b"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 204b</font></a> <a name="iii.v.vi.xxxiv-Page_204b"></a>kept in his own hands the collected payments, let your Fraternity consider whose the moneys are, and to whom they should be paid, and restore them to us, handing them to the above-written presbyter Candidus, our son.  For it is very execrable that what has been preserved by the kings of the nations should be said to be taken away by bishops.</p>
