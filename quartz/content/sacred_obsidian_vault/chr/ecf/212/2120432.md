 <p> <a name="iii.v.iv.xi"></a>
 </p><p class="c27"><a name="iii.v.iv.xi-p1"></a> <span class="c1"><a name="iii.v.iv.xi-p1.1"></a>Epistle XI.</span></p>  
 <p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.iv.xi-p2"></a>To Maximianus, Bishop.</p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.iv.xi-p3"></a>Gregory to Maximianus, Bishop of Syracuse.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.iv.xi-p4"></a>It had indeed been committed to thy Fraternity long ago by our authority to correct in our stead any excesses or unseemly proceedings that there might be in the Church and other venerable places of Sicily <a name="fr_1533"></a><a href="#fn_1533"><font size="1">1534</font></a>
 .  But, seeing that a complaint has reached us of some things having been so far neglected, we have thought it fit that thy Fraternity should again be specially stirred up to correct them.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.iv.xi-p6"></a>For we learn that in the case of revenues of Churches that have been newly acquired the canonical disposition of their fourth parts does not prevail <a name="fr_1534"></a><a href="#fn_1534"><font size="1">1535</font></a>
 , but that the bishops of the several places distribute a fourth part of the ancient revenues only, retaining for their own use those that have been recently acquired.  Wherefore let thy Fraternity make haste actively to correct this evil custom that has crept in, so that, whether in the case of former revenues or of such as have accrued now or may accrue, the fourth parts may be dispensed according to the canonical distribution of them.  For it is unseemly that one and the same substance of the Church should be rated, as it were, under two different laws, namely, that of usurpation and that of the canons.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.iv.xi-p8"></a>Permit not presbyters, deacons, and other clerks of whatever order, who serve churches, to be abbots of monasteries; but let them either, giving up clerical duties, be advanced to the monastic order, or, if they should decide to remain in the position of abbot, let them by no means be allowed to have clerical employment.  For it is very unsuitable that, if one cannot fulfil the duties of either of these positions with diligence proportional to its importance, any one should be judged fit for both, and that so the ecclesiastical order should impede the monastic life, and in turn the rule of monasticism impede ecclesiastical utility.  Of this thing also we have taken thought to warn thy Charity; that, if any one of the bishops should depart this life, or (which <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iv.xi-p8.1"></a>God</span> forbid) should be removed for his transgressions, the hierarchs and all the chief of the clergy being assembled, and in thy presence making an inventory of the property of the Church, all that is found should be accurately described, and nothing should be taken away in kind, or in any other way whatever, from the property of the Church, as is said to have been done formerly, as though in return for the trouble of making the inventories.  For we desire all that pertains to the protection of what belongs to the poor to be so executed that in their affairs no opportunity may be left for the venality of self-interested men.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.iv.xi-p9"></a>Let visitors of churches, and their clerks who with them are at trouble in parishes that are not of their own city, receive according to thy appointment some subsidy for their labour.  For it is just that they should get payment in the places where they are found to lend their services.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.iv.xi-p10"></a>We most strongly forbid young women to be made abbesses.  Let thy Fraternity, therefore, permit no bishop to veil any but a sexagenarian virgin, whose age and character may demand this being done; that so, this as well as the above-named points being set right with the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iv.xi-p10.1"></a>Lords</span> help by the urgency of thy strict requirement, thou mayest hasten to bind up again with canonical ties the long loosened state of venerable things, and also that divine affairs may be arranged, not by the incongruous wills of men, but with adequate strictness.  The month of October, Indiction 12.</p>
