 <p class="c30"><a name="iii.iv.iv.viii-p2"></a>How the impudent and bashful are to be admonished.</p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.iv.iv.viii-p3"></a>(<i>Admonition</i> 8).  Differently to be admonished are the impudent and the bashful.  For those nothing but hard rebuke restrains from the vice of impudence; while these for the most part a modest exhortation disposes to amendment.  Those do not know that they are in fault, unless they be rebuked even by many; to these it usually suffices for their conversion that the teacher at least gently reminds them of their evil deeds.  For those one best corrects who reprehends them by direct invective; but to these greater profit ensues, if what is rebuked in them be touched, as it were, by a side stroke.  Thus the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.iv.iv.viii-p3.1"></a>Lord</span>, openly upbraiding the impudent people of the Jews, saying, <i>There is come unto thee a whores forehead; thou wouldest not blush</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#003">Jerem. iii. 3</a><a name="iii.iv.iv.viii-p3.2"></a>).  But again He revives them when ashamed, saying, <i>Thou shalt forget the confusion of thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood; for thy Maker will reign over thee</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#000">Isa. 1:0</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#004">Isa. 54:4</a><a name="iii.iv.iv.viii-p3.3"></a>).  Paul also openly upbraids the Galatians impudently sinning, when he says, <i>O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#001">Galat. iii. 1</a><a name="iii.iv.iv.viii-p3.4"></a>)?  And again, <i>Are ye so foolish, that, having begun in the Spirit, ye are now made perfect in the flesh</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#003">Gal. 3.3</a><a name="iii.iv.iv.viii-p3.5"></a>)?  But the faults of those who are ashamed he reprehends as though sympathizing with them, saying, <i>I rejoiced in the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.iv.iv.viii-p3.6"></a>Lord</span> greatly, that now at the last ye have flourished again to care for me, as indeed ye did care, for ye lacked opportunity</i>  <a name="page_29b"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 29b</font></a> <a name="iii.iv.iv.viii-Page_29b"></a>(<a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#010">Philipp. iv. 10</a><a name="iii.iv.iv.viii-p3.7"></a>); so that hard upbraiding might discover the faults of the former, and a softer address veil the negligence of the latter.</p>
