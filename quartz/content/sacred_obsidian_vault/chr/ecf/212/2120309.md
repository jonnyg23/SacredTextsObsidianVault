 <p class="c27"><a name="iii.v.i.vii-p2"></a><i>To Anastasius, Patriarch of Antioch</i> <a name="fr_1309"></a><a href="#fn_1309"><font size="1">1310</font></a>

 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.i.vii-p4"></a>Gregory to Anastasius, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.i.vii-p5"></a>I have found what your Blessedness has written to be as rest to the weary, as health to the sick, as a fountain to the thirsty, as shade to the oppressed with heat.  For those words of yours did not seem even to be expressed by the tongue of the flesh, inasmuch as you so disclosed the spiritual love which you bear me as if your soul itself were speaking.  But very hard was that which followed, in that your love enjoined me to bear earthly burdens, and that, having first loved me spiritually, you   <a name="page_77b"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 77b</font></a> <a name="iii.v.i.vii-Page_77b"></a>afterwards, loving me as I think in temporal wise, pressed me down to the ground with the burden you laid upon me; so that, losing utterly all uprightness of soul, and forfeiting the keen vision of contemplation, I may say, not in the spirit of prophecy, but from experience, <i>I am bowed down and brought low altogether</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#107">Psa. 119.107</a><a name="iii.v.i.vii-p5.1"></a> <a name="fr_1310"></a><a href="#fn_1310"><font size="1">1311</font></a>
 ).  For indeed such great burdens of business press me down that my mind can in no wise lift itself up to heavenly things.  I am tossed by the billows of a multitude of affairs, and, after the ease of my former quiet, am afflicted by the storms of a tumultuous life, so that I may truly say, <i>I am come into the depth of the sea, and the storm hath overwhelmed me</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#002">Psa. 69.2</a><a name="iii.v.i.vii-p6.1"></a> <a name="fr_1311"></a><a href="#fn_1311"><font size="1">1312</font></a>
 ).  Stretch out, therefore, the hand of your prayer to me in my danger, you that stand on the shore of virtue.  But as to your calling me the mouth and the lantern of the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.vii-p7.1"></a>Lord</span>, and alleging that I profit many, this also adds to the load of my iniquities, that, when my iniquity ought to have been chastised, I receive praises instead of chastisement.  But with what a bustle of earthly business I am distracted in this place, I cannot express in words; yet you can gather it from the shortness of this letter, in which I say so little to him who I love above all others.  Further, I apprize you that I have requested our most serene lords with all possible urgency to allow you to come to the threshold of Peter, the prince of the apostles, with your dignity restored to you, and to live here with me so long as it may please <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.vii-p7.2"></a>God</span>; to the end that, as long as I am accounted worthy of seeing you, we may relieve the weariness of our pilgrimage by speaking to each other of the heavenly country.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.v.i.vii-p3"></a> Anastasius had been threatened with deposition and exile (<span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.vii-p3.1"></a>a.d.</span> 563) by the Emperor Justinian, and the sentence had been carried into effect (<span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.vii-p3.2"></a>a.d.</span> 570) by Justinians successor, Justin II.  Notwithstanding this, Gregory after his own accession acknowledged him as the true patriarch of Antioch; and, probably owing to his intercession with the Emperor Maurice, Anastasius was restored to his patriarchal See on the death of Gregory, who had been intruded into it, <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.vii-p3.3"></a>a.d.</span> 593.  Other Epistles to, or concerning this Anastasius are I. 25, 26, 28; V. 39; VII. 27, 33; VIII. 2.</p>
