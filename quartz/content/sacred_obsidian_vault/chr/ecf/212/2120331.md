 <p class="c27"><a name="iii.v.i.xxix-p2"></a><i>To Anthemius, Subdeacon</i> <a name="fr_1338"></a><a href="#fn_1338"><font size="1">1339</font></a>

 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.i.xxix-p4"></a>Gregory to Anthemius, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.i.xxix-p5"></a>John, our brother and fellow-bishop, in a schedule sent to us by his cleric Justus, has among many other things intimated to us as follows:  that some monks of the diocese of Surrentum <a name="fr_1339"></a><a href="#fn_1339"><font size="1">1340</font></a>
  transmigrate from monastery to monastery as they please, and depart from the rule of their own abbot out of desire for a worldly life; nay even (what is known to be unlawful) that they aim severally at having property of their own.  Wherefore we command thy Experience by this present order, that no monk be henceforth allowed to migrate from monastery to monastery, and that thou permit not any one of them to have anything of his own.  But, if any one whatever should so presume, let him be sent back with adequate constraint to the monastery in which he lived at first, to be under the rule of his own abbot from which he had escaped; lest, if we allow so great an iniquity to take its course uncorrected, the souls of those that are lost be required from the souls of their superiors.  Further, if any of the clergy should chance to become monks, let it not be lawful for them to return anew to the same church in which they had formerly served, or to any other; unless one should be a monk of such a life that the bishop under whom he had formerly served should think him worthy of the priesthood, so that he may be chosen by him, and by him ordained to such place as he may think fit.  And since we have learnt that some among the monks have plunged into such great wickedness as publicly to take to themselves wives, do thou seek them out with all vigilance, and, when found, send them back with due constraint to the monasteries of which they had been monks.  But neglect not to deal also with the clergy who profess monasticism, as we have said above.  For so thou wilt be pleasing in the eyes of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.xxix-p6.1"></a>God</span>, and be found partaker of a full reward.</p>
