 <p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.v.xxix-p2"></a>To Marinianus, Bishop.</p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.v.xxix-p3"></a>Gregory to Marinianus, Bishop of Ravenna.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.v.xxix-p4"></a>Moved by the benevolence of the Apostolical See and the order of ancient custom, we have thought fit to grant the use of the pallium to thy Fraternity, who art known to have undertaken the office of government in the Church of Ravenna <a name="fr_1621"></a><a href="#fn_1621"><font size="1">1622</font></a>
 .  And remember thou to use it in no other way but in the proper Church of thy city, when the sons (i.e. <i>laity</i>) have been already dismissed, as thou art proceeding from the audience chamber <a name="fr_1622"></a><a href="#fn_1622"><font size="1">1623</font></a>
  to celebrate the sacred solemnities of mass; but, when mass is finished, thou wilt take care to lay it by again in the audience chamber.  But outside the Church, we do not allow thee to use it any more, except four times in the year, in the litanies which we named to thy predecessor John; giving thee at the same time this admonition; that, as through the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.v.xxix-p6.1"></a>Lords</span> bounty thou hast obtained from us the use of an adornment of this kind to the honour of the priestly office, so thou strive to adorn also the office undertaken by thee to the glory of Christ with probity of manners and of deeds.  For thus wilt thou be conspicuous for two adornments answering to each other, if with such a vesture of the body as this the good qualities also of thy soul agree.  For all privileges also which appear evidently to have been formerly granted to thy Church we confirm by our authority, and decree that they continue inviolate.</p>
