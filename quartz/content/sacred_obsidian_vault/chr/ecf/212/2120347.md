 <p><a name="iii.v.i.xlv-p4"></a>If with kind disposition we meet the needs of our neighbours by shewing compassion, we shall undoubtedly find the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.xlv-p4.1"></a>Lord</span> mercifully inclined to our petitions.  Now we have learnt that Pastor, who labours under exceeding weakness of sight, having a wife and two slaves, who also had formerly been with the glorious lady Jonatha, is suffering from great need.  Wherefore, we admonish thy Experience, by the writing of this present order, not to delay giving him for his sustenance three hundred <i>modii</i> of wheat, and also as many <i>modii</i> of beans, which may afterwards be charged in thy accounts.  So act, then, as both thyself to obtain the benefit of reward for thy good service, and to carry our orders into effect.  In the month of August.</p>
