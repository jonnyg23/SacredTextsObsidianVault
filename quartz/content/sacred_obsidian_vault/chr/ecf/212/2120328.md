 </p><p class="c27"><a name="iii.v.i.xxvi-p1"></a> <span class="c1"><a name="iii.v.i.xxvi-p1.1"></a>Epistle XXXVI.</span></p>  
 <p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.i.xxvi-p2"></a>To Peter the Subdeacon.</p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.i.xxvi-p3"></a>Gregory, bishop, servant of the servants of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.xxvi-p3.1"></a>God</span>, to Peter the Subdeacon.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.i.xxvi-p4"></a>The code of instructions which I gave thee on thy going to Sicily must be diligently perused, so that the greatest care may be taken concerning bishops, lest they mix themselves up in secular causes, except so far as the necessity of defending the poor compels them.  But what is inserted in the same code concerning monks or clerics ought, I think, in no respect to be varied from.  But let thy   <a name="page_86b"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 86b</font></a> <a name="iii.v.i.xxvi-Page_86b"></a>Experience observe these things with such great attention as may fulfil my desire in this regard.  Further, it has come to my ears that from the times of Antoninus, the defensor, till now, during these last ten years, many persons have endured certain acts of violence from the Roman Church, so that some publicly complain of their boundaries having been violently invaded, their slaves abstracted, and their moveables carried off by force, and not by any judicial process.  In all such cases I desire thy Experience to keep intent watch, and whatsoever during these last ten years may be found to have been taken away by violence, or retained unjustly in the name of the Church, to restore it by authority of this my order to him to whom it is found to belong; lest he who has suffered violence should be obliged to come to me, and undertake the labour of so long a journey, in which case it could not be ascertained here before me whether or not he spoke the truth.  Having regard, then, to the majesty of the Judge who is to come, restore all things that have been sinfully taken away, knowing that thou bringest great gain to me, if thou gatherest [heavenly] reward rather than riches.  But we have ascertained that what the greater part complain of is the loss of their slaves, saying that, if any mans bondman, peradventure running away from his master, has declared himself to belong to the Church, the rectors <a name="fr_1332"></a><a href="#fn_1332"><font size="1">1333</font></a>
  of the Church have at once kept him as a bondman belonging to the Church, without any trial of the case, but supporting with a high hand the word of the bondman.  This displeases me as much as it is abhorrent from the judgment of truth.  Wherefore I desire thy Experience to correct without delay whatever may be found to have been so done:  and it is also fit that any such slaves as are now kept in ecclesiastical possession, as they were taken away without trial, should be restored before trial; so that, if holy Church has any legitimate claim to them, their possessors may then be dispossessed by regular process of law.  Correct all these things irretractably, since thou wilt be truly a soldier of the blessed apostle Peter if in his causes thou keep guard over the truth, even without his receiving anything.  But, if thou seest anything that may justly be claimed as belonging to the Church, beware lest thou ever try to assert such claim by force; especially as I have established a decree under pain of anathema, that <i>tituli</i> may not ever be put by our Church on any urban or rural farm <a name="fr_1333"></a><a href="#fn_1333"><font size="1">1334</font></a>
 ; but whatever may in reason be claimed for the poor ought also to be defended by reason; lest, a good thing being done in a manner that is not good, we be convicted of injustice before Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.xxvi-p6.1"></a>God</span> even in what we justly seek.  Moreover, I pray thee, let noble laymen, and the glorious [Prætor] <a name="fr_1334"></a><a href="#fn_1334"><font size="1">1335</font></a>
  love thee for thy humility, not dread thee for thy pride.  And yet, if by any chance thou knowest them to be doing any injustice to the indigent, turn thy humility at once into exaltation, so as to be always submissive to them when they do well, and opposed to them when they do ill.  But so behave that neither thy humility be remiss nor thy authority stiff, to the end that uprightness season humility, and humility render thy very uprightness gentle.  Further, since it has been customary for bishops to assemble here for the anniversary <a name="fr_1335"></a><a href="#fn_1335"><font size="1">1336</font></a>
  of the pontiff, forbid their coming for the day of my ordination, since foolish and vain superfluity delights me not.  But if they must needs assemble, let them come for the anniversary <a name="fr_1336"></a><a href="#fn_1336"><font size="1">1337</font></a>
  of Peter, the prince of the apostles, to render thanks to him by whose bounty they are pastors.  Farewell.  Given this XVII day of the Kalends of April, in the ninth year of the Emperor Mauricius.</p>
