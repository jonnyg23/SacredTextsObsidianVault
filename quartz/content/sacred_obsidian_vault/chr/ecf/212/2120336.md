 <p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.i.xxxiv-p2"></a>To Theodorus, Duke of Sardinia.</p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.i.xxxiv-p3"></a>Gregory to Theodorus, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.i.xxxiv-p4"></a>The justice which you bear in your mind you ought to shew in the light of your deeds.  Now Juliana, abbess of the monastery of Saint Vitus which Vitula of venerable memory had once built, has intimated to us that possession of the aforesaid monastery is claimed by Donatus, your official; who, seeing himself to be fortified by your patronage, scorns to have resort to a judicial examination of the case.  But now let your Glory enjoin this same official, with the aforesaid hand-maiden of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.xxxiv-p4.1"></a>God</span>, to submit the matter to arbitration to the end that whatever may be decided as to the question in dispute by the judgment of the arbitrators may be carried into effect; so that, whatever he may find he has to lose or keep, what he does may not be done as a deed of virtue, but set down to the justice of the law.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.i.xxxiv-p5"></a>Further, Pompeiana, a religious lady, who is known to have established a monastery in her own house, has complained that the mother of her deceased son-in-law wishes to annul his will, to the end that her sons last disposition of his property may be made of none effect.  On this account we hold it necessary with paternal charity to exhort your Glory to lend yourself willingly, with due regard to justice, to pious causes, and kindly order that whatever these persons have a rightful claim to be secured to them.  Now, we beseech the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.xxxiv-p5.1"></a>Lord</span> to direct the way of your life propitiously, and grant you a prosperous administration of your dignified office.</p>
