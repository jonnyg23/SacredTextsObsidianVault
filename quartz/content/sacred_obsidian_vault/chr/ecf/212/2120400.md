 <p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.iii.xiv-p2"></a>To John, Subdeacon.</p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.iii.xiv-p3"></a>Gregory to John, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.iii.xiv-p4"></a>Inasmuch as it is manifest that the Apostolic See is, by the ordering of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iii.xiv-p4.1"></a>God</span>, set over all Churches, there is, among our manifold cares, especial demand for our attention, when our decision is awaited with a view to the consecration of a bishop.  Now on the death of Laurentius, bishop of the church of Mediolanum, the clergy reported to us that they had unanimously agreed in the election of our son Constantius, their deacon.  But, their report not having been subscribed, it becomes necessary, that we may omit nothing in the way of caution, for thee to proceed to Genua (<i>Genoa</i>), supported by the authority of this order <a name="fr_1485"></a><a href="#fn_1485"><font size="1">1486</font></a>
 .  And, inasmuch as there are many Milanese at  <a name="page_130b"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 130b</font></a> <a name="iii.v.iii.xiv-Page_130b"></a>present there under stress of barbarian ferocity, thou must call them together, and enquire into their wishes in common.  And, if no diversity of opinion separates them from the unanimity of the election—that is to say, if thou ascertainest that the desire and consent of all continues in favour of our aforesaid son, Constantius,—then thou art to cause him to be consecrated by his own bishops, as ancient usage requires, with the assent of our authority, and the help of the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iii.xiv-p5.1"></a>Lord</span>; to the end that through the observance of such custom both the Apostolic See may retain the power belonging to it, and at the same time may not diminish the rights which it has conceded to others.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.v.iii.xiv-p5"></a> The reason of John the subdeacon being directed to go to Genoa rather than to Milan may have been danger from the Lombards in approaching the latter place, as well as the fact of many of the Milanese having, for the same reason, taken refuge in Genoa.</p>
