 <p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.ii.xii-p2"></a>To John, Bishop.</p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.ii.xii-p3"></a>Gregory to John, Bishop of Prima Justiniana in Illyricum.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.ii.xii-p4"></a>It is clearly a manifest evidence of goodness that the consent of all should concur in the election of one person.  Since, then, the account which we have received from our brethren and fellow-bishops declared that you are summoned to the position of priesthood by the unanimous consent of the whole council and the will of the most serene Prince, we have rendered thanks with great exultation to Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.ii.xii-p4.1"></a>God</span> our Creator, who has made your life and actions so commendable in the past as to bring about (what is exceedingly to your credit) your approving yourself to the judgment of all.  With them we also fully agree with regard to the person of your Fraternity.  And we implore Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.ii.xii-p4.2"></a>God</span> that, as His Grace has chosen your Charity, so He would keep you in all respects under His protection.  We have sent you the pallium according to custom, and, renewing our commission, we appoint you to act as vicar of the Apostolic See, admonishing you that you so shew yourself gentle to your subjects that they may be provoked to love you rather than to fear you.  And, if perchance any fault of theirs should require notice, you will be careful so to correct their transgressions as by no means to discard paternal affection from your mind.  Be watchful and assiduous in the care of the flock committed to you, and strict in the zeal of discipline, so that the wolf lying in wait may not prevail to disturb the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.ii.xii-p4.3"></a>Lords</span> sheepfold, or have opportunity for deceit, so as to hurt the sheep.  Make haste with full purpose of heart to win souls to our <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.ii.xii-p4.4"></a>God</span>; and know that we have received the name of shepherd not for repose, but for labour.  Let us, then, shew forth in our work what our name denotes.  If we weigh with right consideration the prerogative of the priesthood, it will be to those who are diligent and do their duty well for honour, but to those who are negligent assuredly for a burden.  For, as this name, in the sight of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.ii.xii-p4.5"></a>God</span>, conducts those who labour and are assiduous for the salvation of souls to eternal glory, so in the case of the idle and sluggish it tends to punishment.  Through our tongue let the people committed to us learn that there is another life.  Let the teaching of your Fraternity be to them an acceptable spur to urge them on, and your life an example for imitation.  For your Fraternitys preaching should disclose to them what to love and what to fear, and your efficiency in this way should reap the fruit of eternal retribution.  But let your deliberate care especially constrain you never to attempt to make any unlawful ordinations; but, whenever any are promoted to the clerical order, or, it may be, to some higher rank, let them be ordained, not for bribes or entreaties, but for merit.  In no ordination let any consideration, in any way whatever, surreptitiously reach your Fraternity, lest you should be entangled (which <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.ii.xii-p4.6"></a>God</span> forbid) in the snares of simoniacal heresy.  <i>For what shall it profit a man</i>, as the Truth says, <i>if he shall gain the whole word, and lose his own soul</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#036">Mark viii. 36</a><a name="iii.v.ii.xii-p4.7"></a>)?  Hence it is necessary for us to look to <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.ii.xii-p4.8"></a>God</span> in all we do, to despise temporal and perishable things, and to direct the desire of our heart to the good things of eternity.  Your Holinesss present <a name="fr_1410"></a><a href="#fn_1410"><font size="1">1411</font></a>
  I was altogether unwilling to accept, since it were very unseemly for us to seem to have received gifts from our plundered and afflicted brethren.  But your messengers got the better of me by another argument, proffering it to one from whom your Fraternitys offerings may not be withheld <a name="fr_1411"></a><a href="#fn_1411"><font size="1">1412</font></a>
 .  For this you ought before all things to study:  how you may provide imperishable gifts to be offered to the coming judge of souls, to the end that He may have respect both to you for your profitable labour, and to us likewise for our exhortation.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.v.ii.xii-p5"></a> <i>Xenia</i>.  The term denotes, among other kinds of presents, such as were voluntarily offered to superiors, as by the people of a province to proconsuls.  Those here referred to were such as it was the custom for bishops to send to the Pope after their ordination or from time to time.  We find other instances of Gregory deprecating such presents.  “The temporal <i>Xenia</i> which you have sent us, though we are in no need of such, we have nevertheless accepted with due charity.”  (VI. 64, <i>Ad Dominicam episcopum Carthaginensem</i>.)  The word is used also for presents of all kinds.  Cf. e.g. the letter to Ethelbert (XI. 66).</p>
