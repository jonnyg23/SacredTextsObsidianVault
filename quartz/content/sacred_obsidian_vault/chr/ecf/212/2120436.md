 <p><a name="iii.v.iv.xv-p4"></a>It has reached us by the report of many that Christian slaves are detained in servitude by Jews living in the city of Luna <a name="fr_1540"></a><a href="#fn_1540"><font size="1">1541</font></a>
 ; which thing has seemed to us by so much the more offensive as the sufferance of it by thy Fraternity annoys us.  For it was thy duty, in respect of thy place, and in thy regard for the Christian religion, to leave no occasion for simple souls to serve Jewish superstition not through persuasion, but, in a manner, by right of authority.  Wherefore we exhort thy Fraternity that, according to the course laid down by the most pious laws, no Jew be allowed to retain a Christian slave in his possession.  But, if any are found in their power, let liberty be secured to them by protection under the sanction of law.  But as to any that are on the property of Jews, though they be themselves free from legal obligation, yet, since they have long been attached to the cultivation of their lands as bound by the condition of their tenure, let them continue to cultivate the farms they have been accustomed to do, rendering their payments to the aforesaid persons, and performing all things that the laws require of husbandmen or natives, except that no farther burden be imposed on them.  But, whether any one of these should wish to remain in his servitude, or any to migrate to another place, let the latter consider with himself that he will have lost his rights as a husbandman by his own rashness, though he has got rid of his servitude by force of law.  In all these things, then, we desire thee to exert thyself so wisely that neither mayest thou be a guilty pastor of a dismembered flock, nor may thy too little zeal render thee reprehensible before us.</p>
