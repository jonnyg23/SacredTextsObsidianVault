 </p><p class="c27"><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p1"></a> <span class="c1"><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p1.1"></a>Chapter I.</span></p>  
 <p class="c30"><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p2"></a>What diversity there ought to be in the art of preaching.</p>  
 <p class="c31"><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p3"></a>Differently to be admonished are these that follow:—</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p4"></a>Men and women.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p5"></a>The poor and the rich.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p6"></a>The joyful and the sad.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p7"></a>Prelates and subordinates.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p8"></a>Servants and masters.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p9"></a>The wise of this world and the dull.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p10"></a>The impudent and the bashful.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p11"></a>The forward and the fainthearted.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p12"></a>The impatient and the patient.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p13"></a>The kindly disposed and the envious.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p14"></a>The simple and the insincere.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p15"></a>The whole and the sick.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p16"></a>Those who fear scourges, and therefore live innocently; and those who have grown so hard in iniquity as not to be corrected even by scourges.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p17"></a>The too silent, and those who spend time in much speaking.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p18"></a>The slothful and the hasty.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p19"></a>The meek and the passionate.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p20"></a>The humble and the haughty.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p21"></a>The obstinate and the fickle.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p22"></a>The gluttonous and the abstinent.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p23"></a>Those who mercifully give of their own, and those who would fain seize what belongs to others.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p24"></a>Those who neither seize the things of others nor are bountiful with their own; and those who both give away the things they have, and yet cease not to seize the things of others.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p25"></a>Those that are at variance, and those that are at peace.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p26"></a>Lovers of strifes and peacemakers.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p27"></a>Those that understand not aright the words of sacred law; and those who understand them indeed aright, but speak them without humility.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p28"></a>Those who, though able to preach worthily, are afraid through excessive humility; and those whom imperfection or age debars from preaching, and yet rashness impels to it.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p29"></a>Those who prosper in what they desire in temporal matters; and those who covet indeed the things that are of the world, and yet are wearied with the toils of adversity.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p30"></a>Those who are bound by wedlock, and those who are free from the ties of wedlock.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p31"></a>Those who have had experience of carnal intercourse, and those who are ignorant of it.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p32"></a>Those who deplore sins of deed, and those who deplore sins of thought.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p33"></a>Those who bewail misdeeds, yet forsake them not; and those who forsake them, yet bewail them not.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p34"></a>Those who even praise the unlawful things they do; and those who censure what is wrong, yet avoid it not.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p35"></a>Those who are overcome by sudden passion, and those who are bound in guilt of set purpose.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p36"></a>  <a name="page_25b"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 25b</font></a> <a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-Page_25b"></a>Those who, though their unlawful deeds are trivial, yet do them frequently; and those who keep themselves from small sins, but are occasionally whelmed in graver ones.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p37"></a>Those who do not even begin what is good, and those who fail entirely to complete the good begun.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p38"></a>Those who do evil secretly and good publicly; and those who conceal the good they do, and yet in some things done publicly allow evil to be thought of them.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p39"></a>But of what profit is it for us to run through all these things collected together in a list, unless we also set forth, with all possible brevity, the modes of admonition for each?</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p40"></a>(<i>Admonition</i> 1.)  Differently, then, to be admonished are men and women; because on the former heavier injunctions, on the latter lighter are to be laid, that those may be exercised by great things, but these winningly converted by light ones.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p41"></a>(<i>Admonition</i> 2.)  Differently to be admonished are young men and old; because for the most part severity of admonition directs the former to improvement, while kind remonstrance disposes the latter to better deeds.  For it is written, <i>Rebuke not an elder, but entreat him as a father</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#001">1 Tim. v. 1</a><a name="iii.iv.iv.ii-p41.1"></a>).&amp;gt;</p>
