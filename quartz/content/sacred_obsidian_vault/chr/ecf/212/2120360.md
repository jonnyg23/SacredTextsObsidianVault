 <p><a name="iii.v.ii.v-p5"></a>If we administer safely the priestly office which we have received, without doubt both Divine assistance and the affection of our spiritual sons will not be wanting to us.  Wherefore let thy Fraternity take care to shew thyself in all things such that the testimony which the clergy, the nobility, and all the people together, of the city of Naples bears to thee may be strengthened by the increase of thy goodness.  Thou oughtest, then, so to bind thyself to continual employment in exhorting the aforesaid people that the Divine husbandman may store in his garners the fruit of thy word, which thou shalt have gathered from them by thy labours.  But till such time as we shall be able, <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.ii.v-p5.1"></a>God</span> revealing to us His will, to deliberate concerning the things which our aforesaid sons request us should be done, we grant leave for clerics to be ordained from the ranks of the laity, and also for manumissions to be solemnly celebrated before thee in the same church.  Moreover we desire thee to observe without hesitation the customs of the clerical order and of the presbyters  <a name="page_103b"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 103b</font></a> <a name="iii.v.ii.v-Page_103b"></a>of the above-named church:  and do thou also keep such diligent watch in the instruction of the same, that, abstaining from all that is unsuitable or unlawful, they may stand fast, under thy exhortations, ministering with due obedience, in the service of our <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.ii.v-p5.2"></a>God</span>.  The month of January, the tenth Indiction.</p>
