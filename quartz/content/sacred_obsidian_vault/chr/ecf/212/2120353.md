 <p><a name="iii.v.i.li-p4"></a>To those who ask for what is just it behoves us to lend a kindly ear, to the end both that the petitioners may find the remedies they hope for, and that the anxious care of a shepherd be not wanting to the Church.  And inasmuch as the church of Tanates, in which thy Fraternity was formerly adorned with sacerdotal dignity, has for its sins been so taken possession of and ruined by hostile savagery that no further hope remains of thy returning thither, we appoint thee, by authority of these presents, undisputed cardinal priest <a name="fr_1391"></a><a href="#fn_1391"><font size="1">1392</font></a>
  in the Church of Saona, which has now been long deprived of the aid of a pontiff.  Do thou therefore so arrange and order all things according to the injunctions of the canons with vigilant care in the love of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.li-p5.1"></a>God</span>, that both thy Fraternity may rejoice in having attained thy desires, and the Church of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.li-p5.2"></a>God</span> may be filled with answering joy for having received thee as Cardinal pontiff.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.v.i.li-p5"></a> Cardinal bishops, presbyters, or deacons, meant formerly such as were regularly instituted and attached to some particular see, parish, or church, which constituted their title (<i>titulas</i>).  They were then said to be <i>incardinati</i>, the act of so instituting them being called <i>incardinatio</i>.  Cf. II. 37; XIV. 7.</p>
