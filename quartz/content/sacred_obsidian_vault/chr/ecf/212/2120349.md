 </p><p class="c27"><a name="iii.v.i.xlvii-p1"></a> <span class="c1"><a name="iii.v.i.xlvii-p1.1"></a>Epistle LXXIV.</span></p>  
 <p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.i.xlvii-p2"></a>To Gennadius, Patrician and Exarch of Africa.</p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.i.xlvii-p3"></a>Gregory to Gennadius, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.i.xlvii-p4"></a>As the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.xlvii-p4.1"></a>Lord</span> hath made your Excellency to shine with the light of victories in the military wars of this life, so ought you to pose the enemies of the Church with all activity of mind and body, to the end that from both kinds of triumph your reputation may shine forth more and more, when in forensic wars, too, you firmly resist the adversaries of the Catholic Church in behalf of the Christian people, and bravely fight ecclesiastical battles as warriors of the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.xlvii-p4.2"></a>Lord</span>.  For it is known that men heretical in religion, if they have liberty allowed them to do harm (which <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.xlvii-p4.3"></a>God</span> forbid), rise strenuously against the catholic faith, to the end that they may transfuse, if they can, the poison of their heresy to the corrupting of the members of the Christian body.  For we have learnt that they are lifting up their necks against the Catholic Church, the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.xlvii-p4.4"></a>Lord</span> being opposed to them, and desire to pervert the faith of the Christian profession.  But let your Eminence suppress their attempts, and subdue their proud necks to the yoke of rectitude <a name="fr_1385"></a><a href="#fn_1385"><font size="1">1386</font></a>
 .  Moreover, order the council of catholic bishops to be admonished not to appoint their primate on the ground of his standing, without regard to the merits of his life, since before <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.xlvii-p5.2"></a>God</span> it is not the more distinguished rank, but the action of a better life, that is approved <a name="fr_1386"></a><a href="#fn_1386"><font size="1">1387</font></a>
 .  But let the primate himself live, not, as is customary, here and there in the country, but in one city according to their selection, to the end that he may be better able to bring to bear the influence of the dignity that has fallen to him in resisting the Donatists.  Moreover, if any from the Council of Numidia should desire to come to the Apostolic See, permit them to do so; and stop any who may be disposed to bring charges against their character.  Great increase of glory will accrue to your Excellency with the Creator, if through you the union of the divided churches could be restored.  For when He beholds the gifts granted by Him given back to His glory, He bestows gifts so much the more abundantly as He sees the dignity of His religion to be thereby enlarged.  Furthermore, bestowing on you, as is due, the affection of our paternal charity, we beseech the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.xlvii-p6.1"></a>Lord</span> to make your arm strong for subduing your enemies, and to sharpen your soul with zeal for the faith like the edge of a quivering sword.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.v.i.xlvii-p5"></a> The heretics (so called, though they were really rather schismatics than heretics) were the Donatists, who still lingered in Africa in spite of imperial edicts for their suppression.  What Gregory here urges the Exarch to do is to put in force the existing laws against them.  A series of imperial laws against the Donatists will be found in <i>Cod. Theod</i>. Bk. xvi. <i>tit</i>. 5, that of Honorius, <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.xlvii-p5.1"></a>a.d.</span> 414, being especially severe.</p>
 <a name="fn_1386"></a><a href="2120349.htm#fr_1386">98b:1387</a> <a name="iii.v.i.xlvii-p5.3"></a>
 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.v.i.xlvii-p6"></a> It was the immemorial custom in the provinces of Africa generally for the senior bishop of the province according to the date of his consecration to be appointed primate, instead of the bishop of the civil metropolis being such in virtue of his See, as was the rule elsewhere.  (The province of Africa proper, or Africa Proconsularis, was however an exception; for in it the bishop of Carthage was always the primate.)  Hence in Africa the designation Metropolitan was not used, but that of Primate or Senior (<i>senex</i>).  Gregory here, though allowing the old custom of movable primacies, forbids the necessary election of the senior bishop: and this in order to guard against the appointment of unfit persons.  His main motive, as appears from Epistle LXXVI., addressed to the bishops of the province of Numidia, was to preclude the elevation to the primacy of any bishop who had once been a Donatist.  For in it he allows the retention of the old African custom in all respects, save only that no bishop who had been a Donatist was ever to be appointed primate.</p>
