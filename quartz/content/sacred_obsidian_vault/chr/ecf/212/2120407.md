 <p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.iii.xxi-p2"></a>To Andrew, Bishop.</p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.iii.xxi-p3"></a>Gregory to Andrew, Bishop of Tarentum [<i>Taranto, in Calabria</i>].</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.iii.xxi-p4"></a>A man may look without alarm to the tribunal of the eternal Judge, if only, conscious of his own guilt, he strives to pacify Him by befitting penitence.  Now that thou hadst a concubine we find to be manifestly true, with regard to whom also an adverse suspicion has arisen in the minds of some.  But, since in doubtful cases judgment ought not to be absolute, we have chosen to leave the matter to thine own conscience.  If, then, after being constituted in sacred orders thou rememberest having been defiled by carnal intercourse, thou must resign the dignity of priesthood, nor presume by any means to approach its ministration, knowing that thou wilt administer it to the peril of thy soul, and without doubt have to render an account to our <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iii.xxi-p4.1"></a>God</span>, if, being conscious of this crime, thou shouldest desire to continue in the order wherein thou art, concealing the truth.  Wherefore we again exhort thee that, if thou knowest thyself to have been deceived by the craft of the ancient foe, thou hasten to overcome him, while thou mayest, by adequate penitence, lest, as we hope may not be, thou be reckoned as partner with him in the day of judgment.  If, however, thou art not conscious of this guilt, thou must needs continue in the order wherein thou art.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.iii.xxi-p5"></a>Furthermore, since, against due order, thou didst doom a woman on the Church-roll <a name="fr_1493"></a><a href="#fn_1493"><font size="1">1494</font></a>
  to be cruelly beaten with cudgels, although we do not think that she died eight months afterwards, yet, because thou hast had no regard to thy order, we therefore sentence thee to abstain for two months from the administration of mass.  Meanwhile, being suspended from thy office, it will become thee to weep for what thou hast done.  For it is very right that, now that the examples of praiseworthy priests do not provoke thee to the tranquil rectitude befitting thy position, at any rate the medicine of correction should compel thee.</p>
