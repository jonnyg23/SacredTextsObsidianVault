 <p class="c32"><a name="iv.i.iii.xxvii-p1"></a>In contempt of money there is the pattern of justice, which virtue bishops and clerics ought to aim at together with some others. A few words are added on the duty of not bringing an excommunication too quickly into force.</p>  
 <p class="c22"><a name="iv.i.iii.xxvii-p2"></a>133. <span class="sc"><a name="iv.i.iii.xxvii-p2.1"></a>To</span> come to an end; we know that contempt of riches is a form of justice, therefore we ought to avoid love of money, and strive with all our powers never to do anything against justice, but to guard it in all our deeds and actions.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.i.iii.xxvii-p3"></a>134. If we would please God, we must have love, we must be of one mind, we must follow humility, each one thinking the other higher than himself. This is true humility, when one never claims anything proudly for oneself, but thinks oneself to be the inferior. The bishop should treat the clerics and attendants, who are indeed his sons, as members of himself, and give to each one that duty for which he sees him to be fit.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.i.iii.xxvii-p4"></a>135. Not without pain is a limb of the body cut off which has become corrupt. It is treated for a long time, to see if it can be cured with various remedies. If it cannot be cured, then it is cut off by a good physician. Thus it is a good bishops desire to wish to heal the weak, to remove the spreading ulcers, to burn some parts and not to cut them off; and lastly, when they cannot be healed, to cut them off with pain to himself. Wherefore that beautiful rule of the Apostle stands forth brightly, that we should look each one, not on his own things, but on the things of others. <a name="fr_562"></a><a href="#fn_562"><font size="1">563</font></a>
  In this way it will never come about that we shall in anger give way to our own feelings, or concede more than is right in favour to our own wishes.</p>

 <a href="2100091.htm">Next: Chapter XXVIII. Mercy must be freely shown even though it brings an odium of its own. With regard to this, reference is made to the well-known story about the sacred vessels which were broken up by Ambrose to pay for the redemption of captives; and very beautiful advice is given about the right use of the gold and silver which the Church possesses. Next, after showing from the action of holy Lawrence what are the true treasures of the Church, certain rules are laid down which ought to be observed in melting down and employing for such uses the consecrated vessels of the Church.</a></center>
