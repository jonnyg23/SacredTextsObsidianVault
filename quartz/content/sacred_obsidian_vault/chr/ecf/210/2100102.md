 <p> <a name="iv.i.iv.viii"></a> </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iv.i.iv.viii-p0.1"></a>Chapter VIII.</h4>  
 <p class="c32"><a name="iv.i.iv.viii-p1"></a>That those who put what is virtuous before what is useful are acceptable to God is shown by the example of Joshua, Caleb, and the other spies.</p>  
 <p class="c22"><a name="iv.i.iv.viii-p2"></a>53. <span class="sc"><a name="iv.i.iv.viii-p2.1"></a>When</span> could our fathers ever have thrown off their servitude, unless they had believed that it was not only shameful but even useless to serve the king of Egypt?</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.i.iv.viii-p3"></a>54. Joshua, also, and Caleb, when sent to spy out the land, brought back the news that the land was indeed rich, but that it was inhabited by very fierce nations. <a name="fr_648"></a><a href="#fn_648"><font size="1">649</font></a>
  The people, terrified at the thought of war, refused to take possession of their land. Joshua and Caleb, who had been sent as spies, tried to persuade them that the land was fruitful. They thought it unseemly to give way before the heathen; they chose rather to be stoned, which is what the people threatened, than to recede from their virtuous standpoint. The others kept dissuading, the people exclaimed against it, saying they would have to fight against cruel and terrible nations; that they would fall in battle, and their wives and children would be left for a prey. <a name="fr_649"></a><a href="#fn_649"><font size="1">650</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.i.iv.viii-p6"></a>55. The anger of the Lord burst forth, <a name="fr_650"></a><a href="#fn_650"><font size="1">651</font></a>
  so that He would kill all, but at the prayer of Moses He softened His judgment and put off His vengeance, knowing that He had already sufficiently punished those who were faithless, even if He spared them meanwhile and did not slay the unbelievers. However, He said <a name="fr_651"></a><a href="#fn_651"><font size="1">652</font></a>
  they should not come to that land which they had refused, as a penalty for their unbelief; but their children and wives, who had not murmured, and who, owing to their sex and age, were guiltless, should receive the promised inheritance of that land. So the bodies of those of twenty years old and upwards fell in the desert. The punishment of the rest was put aside. But they who had gone up with Joshua, and had thought fit to dissuade the people, died forthwith of a great plague. <a name="fr_652"></a><a href="#fn_652"><font size="1">653</font></a>
  Joshua and Caleb <a name="fr_653"></a><a href="#fn_653"><font size="1">654</font></a>
  entered the land of promise together with those who were innocent by reason of age or sex.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.i.iv.viii-p11"></a>56. The better part, therefore, preferred glory to safety; the worse part safety to virtue. But the divine judgment approved those who thought virtue was above what is useful, whilst it condemned those who preferred what seemed more in accordance with safety than with what is virtuous.</p>

 <a href="2100103.htm">Next: Chapter IX. Cheating and dishonest ways of making money are utterly unfit for clerics whose duty is to serve all. They ought never to be involved in a money affair, unless it is one affecting a man's life. For them the example of David is given, that they should injure none, even when provoked; also the death of Naboth, to keep them from preferring life to virtue.</a></center>
