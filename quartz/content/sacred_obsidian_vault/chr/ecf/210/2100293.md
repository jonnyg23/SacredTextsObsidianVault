 <p> <a name="iv.vi.ii.vi"></a> </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iv.vi.ii.vi-p0.1"></a>Chapter VI.</h4>  
 <p class="c32"><a name="iv.vi.ii.vi-p1"></a>The Novatians, by excluding such from the banquet of Christ, imitate not indeed the good Samaritan, but the proud lawyer, the priest, and the Levite who are blamed in the Gospel, and are indeed worse than these.</p>  
 <p class="c22"><a name="iv.vi.ii.vi-p2"></a>27. <span class="sc"><a name="iv.vi.ii.vi-p2.1"></a>Do</span> you then, O Novatians, shut out  <a name="page_334"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 334</font></a> <a name="iv.vi.ii.vi-Page_334"></a>these? For what is it when you refuse the hope of forgiveness but to shut out? But the Samaritan did not pass by the man who had been left half dead by the robbers; he dressed his wounds with oil and wine, first pouring in oil in order to comfort them; he set the wounded man on his own beast, on which he bore all his sins; nor did the Shepherd despise His wandering sheep.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.vi.ii.vi-p3"></a>28. But you say: “Touch me not.” You who wish to justify yourselves say, “He is not our neighbour,” being more proud than that lawyer who wished to tempt Christ, for he said “Who is my neighbour?” He asked, you deny, going on like that priest, like that Levite passing by him whom you ought to have taken and tended, and not receiving them into the inn for whom Christ paid the two pence, whose neighbour Christ bids you to become that you might show mercy to him. For he is our neighbour whom not only a similar condition has joined, but whom mercy has bound to us. You make yourself strange to him through pride, in vain puffing up yourself in your carnal mind, and not holding the Head. <a name="fr_2946"></a><a href="#fn_2946"><font size="1">2947</font></a>
  For if you held the Head you would consider that you must not forsake him for whom Christ died. If you held the Head you would consider that the whole body, by joining together rather than by separating, grows unto the increase of God <a name="fr_2947"></a><a href="#fn_2947"><font size="1">2948</font></a>
  by the bond of charity and the rescue of a sinner.</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.vi.ii.vi-p6"></a>29. When, then, you take away all the fruits of repentance, what do you say but this: Let no one who is wounded enter our inn, let no one be healed in our Church? With us the sick are not cared for, we are whole, we have no need of a physician, for He Himself says: “They that are whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.”</p>
