 </p><p class="c41"><a name="xi.ii.v-p1"></a>  §5. <i>The same text further explained.</i></p>  
 <p class="c11"><a name="xi.ii.v-p2"></a>For His Only-begotten Son might, ye Arians, be called Father by His Father, yet not in the sense in which you in your error might perhaps understand it, but (while Son of the Father that begat Him) Father of the coming age (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006">Isa. ix. 6</a><a name="xi.ii.v-p2.1"></a>, LXX). For it is necessary not to leave any of your surmises open to you. Well then, He says by the prophet, A Son is born and given to us, whose government is upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Angel of Great Counsel, mighty God, Ruler, Father of the coming age (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006">Isa. ix. 6</a><a name="xi.ii.v-p2.2"></a>). The Only-begotten Son of God, then, is at once Father of the coming age, and mighty God, and Ruler. And it is shewn clearly that all things whatsoever the Father hath are His, and that as the Father gives life, the Son likewise is able to quicken whom He will. For the dead, He says, shall hear the voice of the Son, and shall live (cf. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#025">John v. 25</a><a name="xi.ii.v-p2.3"></a>), and the will and desire of Father and Son is one, since their nature also is one and indivisible. And the Arians torture themselves to no purpose, from not understanding the saying of our Saviour, All things whatsoever the Father hath are Mine. For from this passage at once the delusion of Sabellius can be upset, and it will expose the folly of our modern Jews. For this is why the Only begotten, having life in Himself as the Father has, also knows alone Who the Father is, namely, because He is in the Father and the Father in Him. For He is His Image, and consequently, because He is His Image, all that belongs to the Father is in Him. He is an exact seal, shewing in Himself the Father; living Word and true, Power, Wisdom, our Sanctification and Redemption (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#030">1 Cor. i. 30</a><a name="xi.ii.v-p2.4"></a>). For in Him we both live and move and have <a name="page_90"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 90</font></a> <a name="xi.ii.v-Page_90"></a>our being (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#028">Acts xvii. 28</a><a name="xi.ii.v-p2.5"></a>), and no man knoweth Who is the Father, save the Son, and Who is the Son, save the Father (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#022">Luke x. 22</a><a name="xi.ii.v-p2.6"></a>).</p>
