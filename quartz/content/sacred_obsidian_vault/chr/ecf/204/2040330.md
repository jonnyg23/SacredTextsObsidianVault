 <p class="c11"><a name="xix.ii.xxvii-p2"></a>Thus each surpasses the other in his own peculiar vices. But there is a common blot that attaches to them all, in that through their heresy they are enemies of Christ, and are no <a name="page_265"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 265</font></a> <a name="xix.ii.xxvii-Page_265"></a>longer called Christians <a name="fr_1507"></a><a href="#fn_1507"><font size="1">1508</font></a>
 , but Arians. They ought indeed to accuse each other of the sins they are guilty of, for they are contrary to the faith of Christ; but they rather conceal them for their own sakes. And it is no wonder, that being possessed of such a spirit, and implicated in such vices, they persecute and seek after those who follow not the same impious heresy as themselves; that they delight to destroy them, and are grieved if they fail of obtaining their desires, and think themselves injured, as I said before, when they see those alive whom they wish to perish. May they continue to be injured in such sort, that they may lose the power of inflicting injuries, and that those whom they persecute may give thanks unto the Lord, and say in the words of the twenty-sixth Psalm, The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom then shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life; of whom then shall I be afraid? When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell <a name="fr_1508"></a><a href="#fn_1508"><font size="1">1509</font></a>
 ; and again the thirtieth Psalm, Thou hast saved my soul from adversities; thou hast not shut me up into the hands of mine enemies; thou hast set my foot in a large room <a name="fr_1509"></a><a href="#fn_1509"><font size="1">1510</font></a>
  in Christ Jesus our Lord, through whom to the Father in the Holy Spirit be glory and power for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
