 <p class="c11"><a name="xix.ii.iii-p2"></a>For whom have they ever persecuted and taken, that they have not insulted and injured as they pleased? Whom have they ever sought after and found, that they have not handled in such a manner, that either he has died a miserable death, or has been ill-treated in every way? Whatever the magistrates appear to do, it is their work; and the others are merely the tools of their will and wickedness. In consequence, where is there a place that has not some memorial of their malice? Who has ever opposed them, without their conspiring against him, inventing pretexts for his ruin after the manner of Jezebel? Where is there a Church that is not at this moment lamenting the success of their plots against her Bishops? Antioch is mourning for the orthodox Confessor Eustathius <a name="fr_1396"></a><a href="#fn_1396"><font size="1">1397</font></a>
 ; Balaneæ for the most admirable Euphration <a name="fr_1397"></a><a href="#fn_1397"><font size="1">1398</font></a>
 ; Paltus and Antaradus for Kymatius <a name="fr_1398"></a><a href="#fn_1398"><font size="1">1399</font></a>
  and Carterius; Adrianople for that lover of Christ, Eutropius, and his successor Lucius, who was often loaded with chains by their means, and so perished; Ancyra mourns for Marcellus, Berrhœa <a name="fr_1399"></a><a href="#fn_1399"><font size="1">1400</font></a>
  for Cyrus <a name="fr_1400"></a><a href="#fn_1400"><font size="1">1401</font></a>
 , Gaza for Asclepas. Of all these, after inflicting many outrages, they by their intrigues procured the banishment; but for Theodulus and Olympius, Bishops of Thrace, and for us and our Presbyters, they caused diligent search to be made, to the intent that if we were discovered we should suffer capital punishment: and probably we should have so perished, had we not fled at that very time contrary to their intentions. For letters to that effect were delivered to the Proconsul Donatus against Olympius and his fellows, and to Philagrius against me. And having raised a persecution against Paul, Bishop of Constantinople, as soon as they found him, they caused him to be openly strangled <a name="fr_1401"></a><a href="#fn_1401"><font size="1">1402</font></a>
  at a place called Cucusus in Cappadocia, employing as their executioner for the purpose Philip, who was Prefect. He was a patron of their heresy, and the tool of their wicked designs.</p>
