 <p class="c11"><a name="xviii.ii.vii-p2"></a>Is it not mere madness in my accuser even to suspect me of such a thing? What, I ask again, could induce me to place confidence in this man? What trait did I perceive in his character on which I could rely? He had <a name="page_241"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 241</font></a> <a name="xviii.ii.vii-Page_241"></a>murdered his own master; he had proved faithless to his friends; he had violated his oath; he had blasphemed God, by consulting poisoners and sorcerers <a name="fr_1309"></a><a href="#fn_1309"><font size="1">1310</font></a>
  contrary to his Law. And with what conscience could I send greeting to such a man, whose madness and cruelty had afflicted not me only, but all the world around me? To be sure, I was very greatly indebted to him for his conduct, that when your departed brother had filled our churches with sacred offerings, he murdered him. For the wretch was not moved by the sight of these his gifts, nor did he stand in awe of the divine grace which had been given to him in baptism: but like an accursed and devilish spirit, he raged against him, till your blessed brother suffered martyrdom at his hands; while he, henceforth a criminal like Cain, was driven from place to place, groaning and trembling <a name="fr_1310"></a><a href="#fn_1310"><font size="1">1311</font></a>
 , to the end that he might follow the example of Judas in his death, by becoming his own executioner, and so bring upon himself a double weight of punishment in the judgment to come.</p>
