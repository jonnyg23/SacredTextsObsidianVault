 </p><p class="c41"><a name="vii.ii.iv-p1"></a>  §4. <i>Our creation and Gods Incarnation most intimately connected. As by the Word man was called from non-existence into being, and further received the grace of a divine life, so by the one fault which forfeited that life they again incurred corruption and untold sin and misery filled the world.</i></p>  
 <p class="c11"><a name="vii.ii.iv-p2"></a>You are wondering, perhaps, for what possible reason, having proposed to speak of the Incarnation of the Word, we are at present treating of the origin of mankind. But this, too, properly belongs to the aim of our treatise. 2. For in speaking of the appearance of the Saviour amongst us, we must needs speak also of the origin of men, that you may know that the reason of His coming down was because of us, and that our transgression <a name="fr_202"></a><a href="#fn_202"><font size="1">203</font></a>
  called forth the loving-kindness of the Word, that the Lord should both make haste to help us and appear among men. 3. For of His becoming Incarnate we were the object, and for our salvation He dealt so lovingly as to appear and be born even in a human body. 4. Thus, then, God has made man, and willed that he should abide in incorruption; but men, having despised and rejected the contemplation of God, and devised and contrived evil for themselves (as was said <a name="fr_203"></a><a href="#fn_203"><font size="1">204</font></a>
  in the former treatise), received the condemnation of death with which they had been threatened; and from thenceforth no longer remained as they were made, but <a name="fr_204"></a><a href="#fn_204"><font size="1">205</font></a>
  were being corrupted according to their devices; and death had the mastery over them as king <a name="fr_205"></a><a href="#fn_205"><font size="1">206</font></a>
 . For transgression of the commandment was turning them back to their natural state, so that just as they have had their being out of nothing, so also, as might be expected, they might look for corruption into nothing in the course of time. 5. For if, out of a former normal state of non-existence, they were called into being by the Presence and loving-kindness of the Word, it followed naturally that when men were bereft of the knowledge of God and were turned back to what was not (for what is evil is not, but what is good is), they should, since they derive their being from God who IS, be everlastingly bereft even of being; in other words, that they should be disintegrated and abide in death and corruption. 6. For man is by nature mortal, inasmuch as he is made out of what is not; but by reason of his likeness to Him that is (and if he still preserved this likeness by keeping Him in his knowledge) he would stay his natural corruption, and remain incorrupt; as Wisdom <a name="fr_206"></a><a href="#fn_206"><font size="1">207</font></a>
  says: “The taking heed to His laws is the assurance of immortality;” but being incorrupt, he would live henceforth as God, to which I suppose the divine Scripture refers, when it says: “I have <a name="fr_207"></a><a href="#fn_207"><font size="1">208</font></a>
  said ye are gods, and ye are all sons of the most Highest; but ye die like men, and fall as one of the princes.”</p>
