 <p class="c16"><a name="v.CVI-p2"></a>A long letter in which Jerome answers a number of questions put to him by two sojourners in Getica, Sunnias and Fretela. Diligent students of scripture, these men were at a loss to understand the frequent differences between Jeromes Latin psalter of 383 <span class="c17"><a name="v.CVI-p2.1"></a>a.d.</span> (the so-called Roman psalter) and the LXX, and accordingly sent him a long list of passages with a request for explanation. Jerome in his reply deals fully with all these and points out to his correspondents that they have been misled by their edition of the LXX. (the “common” edition) which differs widely from the critical text of Origen as given in the Hexapla and used by himself. He also expresses his joy to find that even among the Getæ the scriptures are now diligently studied. The date of the letter is about 403 <span class="c17"><a name="v.CVI-p2.2"></a>a.d.</span></p>
