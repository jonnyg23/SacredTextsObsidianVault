 </p><p class="c30"><a name="v.XXXII-p1"></a>  <span class="c1"><a name="v.XXXII-p1.1"></a>Letter XXXII. To Marcella.</span></p>  
 <p class="c16"><a name="v.XXXII-p2"></a>Jerome writes that he is busy collating Aquilas Greek version of the Old Testament with the Hebrew, inquires after Marcellas mother, and forwards the two preceding letters (XXX., XXXI.). Written at Rome in 384 <span class="c17"><a name="v.XXXII-p2.1"></a>a.d.</span></p>  
 <p class="c16"><a name="v.XXXII-p3"></a>1. There are two reasons for the shortness of this letter, one that its bearer is impatient <a name="page_46"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 46</font></a> <a name="v.XXXII-Page_46"></a>to start, and the other that I am too busy to waste time on trifles. You ask what business can be so urgent as to stop me from a chat on paper. Let me tell you, then, that for some time past I have been comparing Aquilas version <a name="fr_743"></a><a href="#fn_743"><font size="1">744</font></a>
  of the Old Testament with the scrolls of the Hebrew, to see if from hatred to Christ the synagogue has changed the text; and—to speak frankly to a friend—I have found several variations which confirm our faith. After having exactly revised the prophets, Solomon, <a name="fr_744"></a><a href="#fn_744"><font size="1">745</font></a>
  the psalter, and the books of Kings, I am now engaged on Exodus (called by the Jews, from its opening words, Eleh shemôth <a name="fr_745"></a><a href="#fn_745"><font size="1">746</font></a>
 ), and when I have finished this I shall go on to Leviticus. Now you see why I can let no claim for a letter withdraw me from my work. However, as I do not wish my friend Currentius <a name="fr_746"></a><a href="#fn_746"><font size="1">747</font></a>
  to run altogether in vain, I have tacked on to this little talk two letters <a name="fr_747"></a><a href="#fn_747"><font size="1">748</font></a>
  which I am sending to your sister Paula, and to her dear child Eustochium. Read these, and if you find them instructive or pleasant, take what I have said to them as meant for you also.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.XXXII-p9"></a>2. I hope that Albina, your mother and mine, is well. In bodily health, I mean, for I doubt not of her spiritual welfare. Pray salute her for me, and cherish her with double affection, both as a Christian and as a mother.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="v.XXXII-p4"></a> This version, made in the reign of Hadrian by a Jewish proselyte who is said by some to have been a renegade Christian, was marked by an exaggerated literalism and a close following of the Hebrew original. By the Church it was regarded with suspicion as being designedly anti-Christian. Jerome, however, here acquits Aquila of the charge brought against him.</p>
