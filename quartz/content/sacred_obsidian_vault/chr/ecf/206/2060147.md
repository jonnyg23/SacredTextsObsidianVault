 </p><p class="c30"><a name="v.CXXXVI-p1"></a>  <span class="c1"><a name="v.CXXXVI-p1.1"></a>Letter CXXXVI. From Pope Innocent to Jerome.</span></p>  
 <p class="c16"><a name="v.CXXXVI-p2"></a>Innocent expresses his sympathy with Jerome and promises to take strong measures to punish his opponents if he will bring specific charges against them. The date of the letter is <span class="c17"><a name="v.CXXXVI-p2.1"></a>a.d.</span> 417.</p>  
 <p class="c16"><a name="v.CXXXVI-p3"></a>Innocent to his most esteemed son, the presbyter Jerome.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.CXXXVI-p4"></a>The apostle <a name="fr_3884"></a><a href="#fn_3884"><font size="1">3885</font></a>
  bears witness that contention has never done good in the church; and for this reason he gives direction that heretics should be admonished once or twice in the beginning of their heresy and not subjected to a long series of rebukes. Where this rule is negligently observed, the evil to be guarded against so far from being evaded is rather intensified.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.CXXXVI-p6"></a>Your grief and lamentation have so affected us that we can neither act nor advise.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.CXXXVI-p7"></a>To begin however, we commend you for the constancy of your faith. To quote your own words spoken many times in the ears of many, a man will gladly face misrepresentation or even personal danger on behalf of the truth; if he is looking for the blessedness that is to come. We remind you of what you have yourself preached although we are sure that you need no reminder. The spectacle of these terrible evils has so thoroughly roused us that we have hastened to put forth the authority of the apostolic see to repress the plague in all its manifestations; but as your letters name no individuals and bring no specific charges, there is no one at present against whom we can proceed. But we do <a name="page_281"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 281</font></a> <a name="v.CXXXVI-Page_281"></a>all that we can; we sympathize deeply with you. And if you will lay a clear and unambiguous accusation against any persons in particular we will appoint suitable judges to try their cases; or if you, our highly esteemed son, think that it is needful for us to take yet graver and more urgent action, we shall not be slow to do so. Meantime we have written to our brother bishop John <a name="fr_3885"></a><a href="#fn_3885"><font size="1">3886</font></a>
  advising him to act more considerately, so that nothing may occur in the church committed to him which it is his duty to foresee and to prevent, and that nothing may happen which may subsequently prove a source of trouble to him.</p>
