 </p><p class="c32"><a name="v.XLV-p1"></a>  <span class="c1"><a name="v.XLV-p1.1"></a>Letter XLV. To Asella.</span></p>  
 <p class="c16"><a name="v.XLV-p2"></a>After leaving Rome for the East, Jerome writes to Asella to refute the calumnies by which he had been assailed, especially as regards his intimacy with Paula and Eustochium. Written on board ship at Ostia, in August, 385 <span class="c17"><a name="v.XLV-p2.1"></a>a.d.</span></p>  
 <p class="c16"><a name="v.XLV-p3"></a>1. Were I to think myself able to requite your kindness I should be foolish. God is able in my stead to reward a soul which is consecrated to Him. So unworthy, indeed, am I of your regard that I have never ventured to estimate its value or even to wish that it might be given me for Christs sake. Some consider me a wicked man, laden with iniquity; and such language is more than justified by my actual sins. Yet in dealing with the bad you do well to account them good. It is dangerous to judge another mans servant; <a name="fr_919"></a><a href="#fn_919"><font size="1">920</font></a>
  and to speak evil of the righteous is a sin not easily pardoned. The day will surely come <a name="page_59"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 59</font></a> <a name="v.XLV-Page_59"></a>when you and I shall mourn for others; for not a few will be in the flames.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.XLV-p5"></a>2. I am said to be an infamous turncoat, a slippery knave, one who lies and deceives others by Satanic arts. Which is the safer course, I should like to know, to invent or credit these charges against innocent persons, or to refuse to believe them, even of the guilty? Some kissed my hands, yet attacked me with the tongues of vipers; sympathy was on their lips, but malignant joy in their hearts. The Lord saw them and had them in derision, <a name="fr_920"></a><a href="#fn_920"><font size="1">921</font></a>
  reserving my poor self and them for judgment to come. One would attack my gait or my way of laughing; another would find something amiss in my looks; another would suspect the simplicity of my manner. Such is the company in which I have lived for almost three years.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.XLV-p7"></a>It often happened that I found myself surrounded with virgins, and to some of these I expounded the divine books as best I could. Our studies brought about constant intercourse, this soon ripened into intimacy, and this, in turn, produced mutual confidence. If they have ever seen anything in my conduct unbecoming a Christian let them say so. Have I taken any ones money? Have I not disdained all gifts, whether small or great? Has the chink of any ones coin been heard in my hand? <a name="fr_921"></a><a href="#fn_921"><font size="1">922</font></a>
  Has my language been equivocal, or my eye wanton? No; my sex is my one crime, and even on this score I am not assailed, save when there is a talk of Paula going to Jerusalem. Very well, then. They believed my accuser when he lied; why do they not believe him when he retracts? He is the same man now that he was then, and yet he who before declared me guilty now confesses that I am innocent. Surely a mans words under torture are more trustworthy than in moments of gayety, except, indeed, that people are prone to believe falsehoods designed to gratify their ears, or, worse still, stories which, till then uninvented, they have urged others to invent.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.XLV-p9"></a>3. Before I became acquainted with the family of the saintly Paula, all Rome resounded with my praises. Almost every one concurred in judging me worthy of the episcopate. Damasus, of blessed memory, spoke no words but mine. <a name="fr_922"></a><a href="#fn_922"><font size="1">923</font></a>
  Men called me holy, humble, eloquent.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.XLV-p11"></a>Did I ever cross the threshold of a light woman? Was I ever fascinated by silk dresses, or glowing gems, or rouged faces, or display of gold? Of all the ladies in Rome but one had power to subdue me, and that one was Paula. She mourned and fasted, she was squalid with dirt, her eyes were dim from weeping. For whole nights she would pray to the Lord for mercy, and often the rising sun found her still at her prayers. The psalms were her only songs, the Gospel her whole speech, continence her one indulgence, fasting the staple of her life. The only woman who took my fancy was one whom I had not so much as seen at table. But when I began to revere, respect, and venerate her as her conspicuous chastity deserved, all my former virtues forsook me on the spot.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.XLV-p12"></a>4. Oh! envy, that dost begin by tearing thyself! Oh! cunning malignity of Satan, that dost always persecute things holy! Of all the ladies in Rome, the only ones that caused scandal were Paula and Melanium, who, despising their wealth and deserting their children, uplifted the cross of the Lord as a standard of religion. Had they frequented the baths, or chosen to use perfumes, or taken advantage of their wealth and position as widows to enjoy life and to be independent, they would have been saluted as ladies of high rank and saintliness. As it is, of course, it is in order to appear beautiful that they put on sackcloth and ashes, and they endure fasting and filth merely to go down into the Gehenna of fire! As if they could not perish with the crowd whom the mob applauds! <a name="fr_923"></a><a href="#fn_923"><font size="1">924</font></a>
  If it were Gentiles or Jews who thus assailed their mode of life, they would at least have the consolation of failing to please only those whom Christ Himself has failed to please. But, shameful to say, it is Christians who thus neglect the care of their own households, and, disregarding the beams in their own eyes, look for motes in those of their neighbors. <a name="fr_924"></a><a href="#fn_924"><font size="1">925</font></a>
  They pull to pieces every profession of religion, and think that they have found a remedy for their own doom, if they can disprove the holiness of others, if they can detract from every one, if they can show that those who perish are many, and sinners, a great multitude.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.XLV-p15"></a>5. You bathe daily; another regards such over-niceness as defilement. You surfeit yourself on wild fowl and pride yourself on eating sturgeon; I, on the contrary, fill my belly with beans. You find pleasure in troops of laughing girls; I prefer Paula and Melanium who weep. You covet what belongs to others; they disdain what is their own. You like wines flavored with honey; they drink cold water, more delicious still. You count as lost what you cannot have, eat up, <a name="page_60"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 60</font></a> <a name="v.XLV-Page_60"></a>and devour on the moment; they believe in the Scriptures, and look for good things to come. And if they are wrong, and if the resurrection of the body on which they rely is a foolish delusion, what does it matter to you? We, on our side, look with disfavor on such a life as yours. You can fatten yourself on your good things as much as you please; I for my part prefer paleness and emaciation. You suppose that men like me are unhappy; we regard you as more unhappy still. Thus we reciprocate each others thoughts, and appear to each other mutually insane.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.XLV-p16"></a>6. I write this in haste, dear Lady Asella, as I go on board, overwhelmed with grief and tears; yet I thank my God that I am counted worthy of the worlds hatred. <a name="fr_925"></a><a href="#fn_925"><font size="1">926</font></a>
  Pray for me that, after Babylon, I may see Jerusalem once more; that Joshua, the son of Josedech, may have dominion over me, <a name="fr_926"></a><a href="#fn_926"><font size="1">927</font></a>
  and not Nebuchadnezzar, that Ezra, whose name means helper, may come and restore me to my own country. I was a fool in wishing to sing the Lords song in a strange land, <a name="fr_927"></a><a href="#fn_927"><font size="1">928</font></a>
  and in leaving Mount Sinai, to seek the help of Egypt. I forgot that the Gospel warns us <a name="fr_928"></a><a href="#fn_928"><font size="1">929</font></a>
  that he who goes down from Jerusalem immediately falls among robbers, is spoiled, is wounded, is left for dead. But, although priest and Levite may disregard me, there is still the good Samaritan who, when men said to him, “Thou art a Samaritan and hast a devil,” <a name="fr_929"></a><a href="#fn_929"><font size="1">930</font></a>
  disclaimed having a devil, but did not disclaim being a Samaritan, <a name="fr_930"></a><a href="#fn_930"><font size="1">931</font></a>
  this being the Hebrew equivalent for our word guardian. Men call me a mischief-maker, and I take the title as a recognition of my faith. For I am but a servant, and the Jews still call my master a magician. The apostle, <a name="fr_931"></a><a href="#fn_931"><font size="1">932</font></a>
  likewise, is spoken of as a deceiver. There hath no temptation taken me but such as is common to man. <a name="fr_932"></a><a href="#fn_932"><font size="1">933</font></a>
  How few distresses have I endured, I who am yet a soldier of the cross! Men have laid to my charge a crime of which I am not guilty; <a name="fr_933"></a><a href="#fn_933"><font size="1">934</font></a>
  but I know that I must enter the kingdom of heaven through evil report as well as through good. <a name="fr_934"></a><a href="#fn_934"><font size="1">935</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="v.XLV-p27"></a>7. Salute Paula and Eustochium, who, whatever the world may think, are always mine in Christ. Salute Albina, your mother, and Marcella, your sister; Marcellina also, and the holy Felicitas; and say to them all: “We must all stand before the judgment seat of Christ, <a name="fr_935"></a><a href="#fn_935"><font size="1">936</font></a>
  and there shall be revealed the principle by which each has lived.”</p>  
 <p><a name="v.XLV-p29"></a>And now, illustrious model of chastity and virginity, remember me, I beseech you, in your prayers, and by your intercessions calm the waves of the sea.</p>
