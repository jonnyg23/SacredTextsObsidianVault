 </p><p class="c30"><a name="v.CXIV-p1"></a>  <span class="c1"><a name="v.CXIV-p1.1"></a>Letter CXIV. To Theophilus.</span></p>  
 <p class="c16"><a name="v.CXIV-p2"></a>Jerome writes to Theophilus to apologize for his delay in sending Latin versions of the latters letter (CXIII.) and invective against John Chrysostom. Possibly, however, the allusion may be not to these but to some other work of Theophilus (e.g. a paschal letter.) This delay he attributes to the disturbed state of Palestine, the severity of the winter, the prevalent famine, and his own ill-health. He now sends the translations that he has made and, while he deprecates criticism on his own work, praises that of Theophilus, quoting with particular approval the directions given by this latter for the reverent care of the vessels used in celebrating the holy communion. The date of the letter is 405 <span class="c17"><a name="v.CXIV-p2.1"></a>a.d.</span></p>  
 <p class="c16"><a name="v.CXIV-p3"></a>To the most blessed pope Theophilus, Jerome.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.CXIV-p4"></a>1. My delay in sending back to your holiness your treatise translated into Latin is accounted for by the many interruptions and obstacles that I have met with. There has been a sudden raid of the Isaurians; Phœnicia and Galilee have been laid waste; Palestine has been panic-stricken, and particularly Jerusalem; we have all been engaged in making not books but walls. There has also been a severe winter and an almost unbearable famine; and these have told heavily upon me who have the charge of many brothers. Amid <a name="page_215"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 215</font></a> <a name="v.CXIV-Page_215"></a>these difficulties the work of translation went on by night, as I could save or snatch time to give to it. At last I got it done and by Lent nothing remained but to collate the fair copy with the original. However, just then a severe illness seized me and I was brought to the threshold of death, from which I have only been saved by Gods mercy and your prayers; perhaps for this very purpose that I might fulfil your behest and render with its writers elegance the charming volume which you have adorned with the scriptures fairest flowers. But bodily weakness and sorrow of heart have, I need hardly say, dulled the edge of my intellect and obstructed the free flow of my language.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.CXIV-p5"></a>2. I admire in your work its practical aim, designed as it is to instruct by the authority of scripture ignorant persons in all the churches concerning the reverence with which they must handle holy things and minister at Christs altar; and to impress upon them that the sacred chalices, veils, <a name="fr_3054"></a><a href="#fn_3054"><font size="1">3055</font></a>
  and other accessories used in the celebration of the Lords passion are not mere lifeless and senseless objects devoid of holiness, but that rather, from their association with the body and blood of the Lord, they are to be venerated with the same awe as the body and the blood themselves.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.CXIV-p7"></a>3. Take back then your book, nay mine or better still ours; for when you flatter me you will but flatter yourself. It is for you that my brain has toiled; it is for you that I have striven with the poor resources of the Latin tongue to find an equivalent for the eloquence of the Greek. I have not indeed given a word-for-word rendering, as skilled translators do, nor have I counted out the money you have given to me coin by coin; but I have given you full weight. Some words may be missing but none of the sense is lost. Moreover I have translated into Latin and prefixed to this volume the letter that you sent to me, so that all who read it may know that I have acted under the commands of your holiness, and have not rashly and over-confidently undertaken a task that is beyond my powers. Whether I have succeeded in it I must leave to your judgment. Even though you may blame my weakness, you will at least give me credit for my good intention.</p>
