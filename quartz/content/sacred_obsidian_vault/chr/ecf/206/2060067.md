 <p class="c16"><a name="v.LVI-p2"></a>Augustines first letter to Jerome (printed in his correspondence in this Library as Letter XXVIII.): through a series of accidents it was not delivered until nine years after it had been written. In it Augustine comments on Jeromes new Latin version of the O.T. and advises him in his future labours to adhere more closely to the text of the LXX. He also discusses Jeromes account (in his commentary on the epistle to the Galatians) of the quarrel between Paul and Peter at Antioch. This according to Jerome was not a real misunderstanding but only one artificially got up to put clearly before the Church the mischief of Christians conforming to the now obsolete Mosaic Law. Augustine strongly controverts this view and maintains that it is fatal to the veracity and authority claimed for scripture. Written from Hippo about the year 394 <span class="c17"><a name="v.LVI-p2.1"></a>a.d.</span></p>
