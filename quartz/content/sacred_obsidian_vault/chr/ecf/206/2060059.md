 </p><p class="c30"><a name="v.XLVIII-p1"></a>  <span class="c1"><a name="v.XLVIII-p1.1"></a>Letter XLVIII. To Pammachius.</span></p>  
 <p class="c16"><a name="v.XLVIII-p2"></a>An “apology” for the two books “against Jovinian” which Jerome had written a short time previously, and of which he had sent copies to Rome. These Pammachius and his other friends had withheld from publication, thinking that Jerome had unduly exalted virginity at the expense of marriage. He now writes to make good his position, and to do this makes copious extracts from the obnoxious treatise. The date of the letter is 393 or 394 <span class="c17"><a name="v.XLVIII-p2.1"></a>a.d.</span></p>  
 <p class="c16"><a name="v.XLVIII-p3"></a>1. Your own silence is my reason for not having written hitherto. For I feared that, if I were to write to you without first hearing from you, you would consider me not so much a conscientious as a troublesome correspondent. But, now that I have been challenged by your most delightful letter, a letter which calls upon me to defend my views by an appeal to first principles, I receive my old fellow-learner, companion, and friend with open arms, as the saying goes; and I look forward to having in you a champion of my poor writings; if, that is to say, I can first conciliate your judgment to give sentence in my favor, and can instruct my advocate in all those points on which I am assailed. For both your favorite, Cicero, and before him—in his one short treatise—Antonius, <a name="fr_1036"></a><a href="#fn_1036"><font size="1">1037</font></a>
  write to this effect, that the chief requisite for victory is to acquaint ones self carefully with the case which one has to plead.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.XLVIII-p5"></a>2. Certain persons find fault with me because in the books which I have written against Jovinian I have been excessive (so they say) in praise of virginity and in depreciation of marriage; and they affirm that to preach up chastity till no comparison is left between a wife and a virgin is equivalent to a condemnation of matrimony. If I remember aright the point of the dispute, the question at issue between myself and Jovinian is that he puts marriage on a level with virginity, while I make it inferior; he declares that there is little or no difference between the two states, I assert that there is a great deal. Finally—a result due under God to your agency—he has been condemned because he has dared to set matrimony on an equality with perpetual chastity. Or, if a virgin and a wife are to be looked on as the same, how comes it that Rome has refused to listen to this impious doctrine? A virgin owes her being to a man, but a man does not owe his to a virgin. There can be no middle course. Either my view of the matter must be embraced, or else that of Jovinian. If I am blamed for putting wed<a name="page_67"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 67</font></a> <a name="v.XLVIII-Page_67"></a>lock below virginity, he must be praised for putting the two states on a level. If, on the other hand, he is condemned for supposing them equal, his condemnation must be taken as testimony in favor of my treatise. If men of the world chafe under the notion that they occupy a position inferior to that of virgins, I wonder that clergymen and monks—who both live celibate lives—refrain from praising what they consistently practise. They cut themselves off from their wives to imitate the chastity of virgins, and yet they will have it that married women are as good as these. They should either be joined again to their wives whom they have renounced, or, if they persist in living apart from them, they will have to confess—by their lives if not by their words—that, in preferring virginity to marriage, they have chosen the better course. Am I then a mere novice in the Scriptures, reading the sacred volumes for the first time? And is the line there drawn between virginity and marriage so fine that I have been unable to observe it? I could know nothing, forsooth, of the saying, “Be not righteous overmuch!” <a name="fr_1037"></a><a href="#fn_1037"><font size="1">1038</font></a>
  Thus, while I try to protect myself on one side, I am wounded on the other; to speak more plainly still, while I close with Jovinian in hand-to-hand combat, Manichæus stabs me in the back. Have I not, I would ask, in the very forefront of my work set the following preface: <a name="fr_1038"></a><a href="#fn_1038"><font size="1">1039</font></a>
  “We are no disciples of Marcion <a name="fr_1039"></a><a href="#fn_1039"><font size="1">1040</font></a>
  or of Manichæus, <a name="fr_1040"></a><a href="#fn_1040"><font size="1">1041</font></a>
  to detract from marriage. Nor are we deceived by the error of Tatian, <a name="fr_1041"></a><a href="#fn_1041"><font size="1">1042</font></a>
  the chief of the Encratites, <a name="fr_1042"></a><a href="#fn_1042"><font size="1">1043</font></a>
  into supposing all cohabitation unclean. For he condemns and reprobates not marriage only, but foods also which God has created for us to enjoy. <a name="fr_1043"></a><a href="#fn_1043"><font size="1">1044</font></a>
  We know that in a large house there are vessels not only of silver and of gold, but of wood also and of earth. <a name="fr_1044"></a><a href="#fn_1044"><font size="1">1045</font></a>
  We know, too, that on the foundation of Christ which Paul the master builder has laid, some build up gold, silver, and precious stones; others, on the contrary, hay, wood, and stubble. <a name="fr_1045"></a><a href="#fn_1045"><font size="1">1046</font></a>
  We are not ignorant that marriage is honorable…and the bed undefiled. <a name="fr_1046"></a><a href="#fn_1046"><font size="1">1047</font></a>
  We have read the first decree of God: Be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth. <a name="fr_1047"></a><a href="#fn_1047"><font size="1">1048</font></a>
  But while we allow marriage, we prefer the virginity which springs from it. Gold is more precious than silver, but is silver on that account the less silver? Is it an insult to a tree to prefer its apples to its roots or its leaves? Is it an injury to corn to put the ear before the stalk and the blade? As apples come from the tree and grain from the straw, so virginity comes from wedlock. Yields of one hundredfold, of sixtyfold, and of thirtyfold <a name="fr_1048"></a><a href="#fn_1048"><font size="1">1049</font></a>
  may all come from one soil and from one sowing, yet they will differ widely in quantity. The yield thirtyfold signifies wedlock, for the joining together of the fingers to express that number, suggestive as it is of a loving gentle kiss or embracing, aptly represents the relation of husband and wife. The yield sixtyfold refers to widows who are placed in a position of distress and tribulation. Accordingly, they are typified by that finger which is placed under the other to express the number sixty; for, as it is extremely trying when one has once tasted pleasure to abstain from its enticements, so the reward of doing this is proportionately great. Moreover, a hundred—I ask the reader to give me his best attention—necessitates a change from the left hand to the right; but while the hand is different the fingers are the same as those which on the left hand signify married women and widows; only in this instance the circle formed by them indicates the crown of virginity.” <a name="fr_1049"></a><a href="#fn_1049"><font size="1">1050</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="v.XLVIII-p19"></a>3. Does a man who speaks thus, I would ask you, condemn marriage? If I have called virginity gold, I have spoken of marriage as silver. I have set forth that the yields an hundredfold, sixtyfold, and thirtyfold—all spring from one soil and from one sowing, although in amount they differ widely. Will any of my readers be so unfair as to judge me, not by my words, but by his own opinion? At any rate, I have dealt much more gently with marriage than most Latin and Greek writers; <a name="fr_1050"></a><a href="#fn_1050"><font size="1">1051</font></a>
  who, by referring the hundredfold yield to martyrs, the sixtyfold to virgins, and the thirtyfold to widows, show that in their opinion married persons are excluded from the good ground and from the seed of the great Father. <a name="fr_1051"></a><a href="#fn_1051"><font size="1">1052</font></a>
  But, lest it might be supposed that, though cautious at the outset, I was imprudent in the remainder of my work, have I not, after <a name="page_68"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 68</font></a> <a name="v.XLVIII-Page_68"></a>marking out the divisions of it, on coming to the actual questions immediately introduced the following: <a name="fr_1052"></a><a href="#fn_1052"><font size="1">1053</font></a>
  “I ask all of you of both sexes, at once those who are virgins and continent and those who are married or twice married, to aid my efforts with your prayers.” Jovinian is the foe of all indiscriminately, but can I condemn as Manichæan heretics persons whose prayers I need and whose assistance I entreat to help me in my work?</p>  
 <p><a name="v.XLVIII-p23"></a>4. As the brief compass of a letter does not suffer us to delay too long on a single point, let us now pass to those which remain. In explaining the testimony of the apostle, “The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband; and likewise, also, the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife,” <a name="fr_1053"></a><a href="#fn_1053"><font size="1">1054</font></a>
  we have subjoined the following: <a name="fr_1054"></a><a href="#fn_1054"><font size="1">1055</font></a>
  “The entire question relates to those who are living in wedlock, whether it is lawful for them to put away their wives, a thing which the Lord also has forbidden in the Gospel. <a name="fr_1055"></a><a href="#fn_1055"><font size="1">1056</font></a>
  Hence, also, the apostle says: It is good for a man not to touch a wife or a woman, <a name="fr_1056"></a><a href="#fn_1056"><font size="1">1057</font></a>
  as if there were danger in the contact which he who should so touch one could not escape. Accordingly, when the Egyptian woman desired to touch Joseph he flung away his cloak and fled from her hands. <a name="fr_1057"></a><a href="#fn_1057"><font size="1">1058</font></a>
  But as he who has once married a wife cannot, except by consent, abstain from intercourse with her or repudiate her, so long as she does not sin, he must render unto his wife her due, <a name="fr_1058"></a><a href="#fn_1058"><font size="1">1059</font></a>
  because he has of his own free will bound himself to render it under compulsion.” Can one who declares that it is a precept of the Lord that wives should not be put away, and that what God has joined together man must not, without consent, put asunder <a name="fr_1059"></a><a href="#fn_1059"><font size="1">1060</font></a>
 —can such an one be said to condemn marriage? Again, in the verses which follow, the apostle says: “But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.” <a name="fr_1060"></a><a href="#fn_1060"><font size="1">1061</font></a>
  In explanation of this saying we made the following remarks: <a name="fr_1061"></a><a href="#fn_1061"><font size="1">1062</font></a>
  “What I myself would wish, he says, is clear. But since there are diversities of gifts in the church, <a name="fr_1062"></a><a href="#fn_1062"><font size="1">1063</font></a>
  I allow marriage as well, that I may not appear to condemn nature. Reflect, too, that the gift of virginity is one thing, that of marriage another. For had there been one reward for married women and for virgins he would never, after giving the counsel of continence, have gone on to say: But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner and another after that. Where each class has its proper gift, there must be some distinction between the classes. I allow that marriage, as well as virginity, is the gift of God, but there is a great difference between gift and gift. Finally, the apostle himself says of one who had lived in incest and afterwards repented: Contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him and comfort him, <a name="fr_1063"></a><a href="#fn_1063"><font size="1">1064</font></a>
  and To whom ye forgive anything, I forgive also. <a name="fr_1064"></a><a href="#fn_1064"><font size="1">1065</font></a>
  And, lest we might suppose a mans gift to be but a small thing, he has added: For if I forgave anything, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the sight <a name="fr_1065"></a><a href="#fn_1065"><font size="1">1066</font></a>
  of Christ. <a name="fr_1066"></a><a href="#fn_1066"><font size="1">1067</font></a>
  The gifts of Christ are different. Hence Joseph as a type of Him had a coat of many colors. <a name="fr_1067"></a><a href="#fn_1067"><font size="1">1068</font></a>
  So in the forty-fourth psalm <a name="fr_1068"></a><a href="#fn_1068"><font size="1">1069</font></a>
  we read of the Church: Upon thy right hand did stand the queen in a vesture of gold, wrought about with divers colors. <a name="fr_1069"></a><a href="#fn_1069"><font size="1">1070</font></a>
  The apostle Peter, too, speaks (of husbands and wives) as being heirs together of the manifold grace of God. <a name="fr_1070"></a><a href="#fn_1070"><font size="1">1071</font></a>
  In Greek the expression is still more striking, the word used being <span class="Greek"><a name="v.XLVIII-p41.2"></a>ποικίλη</span>, that is, many-colored.”</p>  
 <p><a name="v.XLVIII-p42"></a>5. I ask, then, what is the meaning of mens obstinate determination to shut their eyes and to refuse to look on what is as clear as day? I have said that there are diversities of gifts in the Church, and that virginity is one gift and wedlock another. And shortly after I have used the words: “I allow marriage also to be a gift of God, but there is a great difference between gift and gift.” Can it be said that I condemn that which in the clearest terms I declare to be the gift of God? Moreover, if Joseph is taken as a type of the Lord, his coat of many colors is a type of virgins and widows, celibates and wedded. Can any one who has any part in Christs tunic be regarded as an alien? Have we not spoken of the very queen herself—that is, the Church of the Saviour—as wearing a vesture of gold wrought about with divers colors? Moreover, when I came to discuss marriage in connection with the following verses, <a name="fr_1071"></a><a href="#fn_1071"><font size="1">1072</font></a>
  I still adhered to the same view. <a name="fr_1072"></a><a href="#fn_1072"><font size="1">1073</font></a>
  “This passage,” I said, “has indeed no relation to the present controversy; for, following the decision of the Lord, the apostle teaches that a wife must not be put away saving for fornication, and <a name="page_69"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 69</font></a> <a name="v.XLVIII-Page_69"></a>that, if she has been put away, she cannot during the lifetime of her husband marry another man, or, at any rate, that she ought, if possible, to be reconciled to her husband. In another verse he speaks to the same effect: The wife is bound…as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband; <a name="fr_1073"></a><a href="#fn_1073"><font size="1">1074</font></a>
  she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord, <a name="fr_1074"></a><a href="#fn_1074"><font size="1">1075</font></a>
  that is to a Christian. Thus the apostle, while he allows a second or a third marriage in the Lord, forbids even a first with a heathen.”</p>  
 <p><a name="v.XLVIII-p47"></a>6. I ask my detractors to open their ears and to realize the fact that I have allowed second and third marriages “in the Lord.” If, then, I have not condemned second and third marriages, how can I have proscribed a first? Moreover, in the passage where I interpret the words of the apostle, “Is any man called being circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised” <a name="fr_1075"></a><a href="#fn_1075"><font size="1">1076</font></a>
  (a passage, it is true, which some most careful interpreters of Scripture refer to the circumcision and slavery of the Law), do I not in the clearest terms stand up for the marriage-tie? My words are these: <a name="fr_1076"></a><a href="#fn_1076"><font size="1">1077</font></a>
  “If any man is called in uncircumcision, let him not be circumcised. You had a wife, the apostle says, when you believed. Do not fancy your faith in Christ to be a reason for parting from her. For God hath called us in peace. <a name="fr_1077"></a><a href="#fn_1077"><font size="1">1078</font></a>
  Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing but the keeping of the commandments of God. <a name="fr_1078"></a><a href="#fn_1078"><font size="1">1079</font></a>
  Neither celibacy nor wedlock is of the slightest use without works, since even faith, the distinguishing mark of Christians, if it have not works, is said to be dead, <a name="fr_1079"></a><a href="#fn_1079"><font size="1">1080</font></a>
  and on such terms as these the virgins of Vesta or of Juno, who was constant to one <a name="fr_1080"></a><a href="#fn_1080"><font size="1">1081</font></a>
  husband, might claim to be numbered among the saints. And a little further on he says: Art thou called being a servant, care not for it; but, if thou mayest be made free, use it rather; <a name="fr_1081"></a><a href="#fn_1081"><font size="1">1082</font></a>
  that is to say, if you have a wife, and are bound to her, and render her her due, and have not power of your own body—or, to speak yet more plainly—if you are the slave of a wife, do not allow this to cause you sorrow, do not sigh over the loss of your virginity. Even if you can find pretexts for parting from her to enjoy the freedom of chastity, do not seek your own welfare at the price of anothers ruin. Keep your wife for a little, and do not try too hastily to overcome her reluctance. Wait till she follows your example. If you only have patience, your wife will some day become your sister.”</p>  
 <p><a name="v.XLVIII-p55"></a>7. In another passage we have discussed the reasons which led Paul to say: “Now concerning virgins, I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.” <a name="fr_1082"></a><a href="#fn_1082"><font size="1">1083</font></a>
  Here also, while we have extolled virginity, we have been careful to give marriage its due. <a name="fr_1083"></a><a href="#fn_1083"><font size="1">1084</font></a>
  “Had the Lord commanded virginity,” we said, “He would have seemed to condemn marriage and to do away with that seed-plot of humanity from which virginity itself springs. Had He cut away the root how could He have looked for fruit? Unless He had first laid the foundations, how could He have built the edifice or crowned it with a roof made to cover its whole extent?” If we have spoken of marriage as the root whose fruit is virginity, and if we have made wedlock the foundation on which the building or the roof of perpetual chastity is raised, which of my detractors can be so captious or so blind as to ignore the foundation on which the fabric and its roof are built, while he has before his eyes both the fabric and the roof themselves? Once more, in another place, we have brought forward the testimony of the apostle to this effect: “Art thou bound unto a wife? Seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? Seek not a wife.” <a name="fr_1084"></a><a href="#fn_1084"><font size="1">1085</font></a>
  To this we have appended the following remarks: <a name="fr_1085"></a><a href="#fn_1085"><font size="1">1086</font></a>
  “Each of us has his own sphere allotted to him. Let me have mine, and do you keep yours. If you are bound to a wife, do not put her away. If I am loosed from a wife, let me not seek a wife. Just as I do not loose marriage-ties when they are once made, so do you refrain from binding together what at present is loosed from such ties.” Yet another passage bears unmistakable testimony to the view which we have taken of virginity and of wedlock: <a name="fr_1086"></a><a href="#fn_1086"><font size="1">1087</font></a>
  “The apostle casts no snare upon us, <a name="fr_1087"></a><a href="#fn_1087"><font size="1">1088</font></a>
  nor does he compel us to be what we do not wish. He only urges us to what is honorable and seemly, inciting us earnestly to serve the Lord, to be anxious always to please Him, and to look for His will which He has prepared for us to do. We are to be like alert and armed soldiers, who immediately execute the orders given to them and perform them without that travail of mind <a name="fr_1088"></a><a href="#fn_1088"><font size="1">1089</font></a>
  which, <a name="page_70"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 70</font></a> <a name="v.XLVIII-Page_70"></a>according to the preacher, is given to the men of this world to be exercised therewith.” <a name="fr_1089"></a><a href="#fn_1089"><font size="1">1090</font></a>
  At the end, also, of our comparison of virgins and married women we have summed up the discussion thus: <a name="fr_1090"></a><a href="#fn_1090"><font size="1">1091</font></a>
  “When one thing is good and another thing is better; when that which is good has a different reward from that which is better; and when there are more rewards than one, then, obviously, there exists a diversity of gifts. The difference between marriage and virginity is as great as that between not doing evil and doing good—or, to speak more favorably still, as that between what is good and what is still better.”</p>  
 <p><a name="v.XLVIII-p65"></a>8. In the sequel we go on to speak thus: <a name="fr_1091"></a><a href="#fn_1091"><font size="1">1092</font></a>
  “The apostle, in concluding his discussion of marriage and of virginity, is careful to observe a mean course in discriminating between them, and, turning neither to the right hand nor to the left, he keeps to the Kings highway, <a name="fr_1092"></a><a href="#fn_1092"><font size="1">1093</font></a>
  and thus fulfils the injunction, Be not righteous overmuch. <a name="fr_1093"></a><a href="#fn_1093"><font size="1">1094</font></a>
  Moreover, when he goes on to compare monogamy with digamy, he puts digamy after monogamy, just as before he subordinated marriage to virginity.” Do we not clearly show by this language what is typified in the Holy Scriptures by the terms right and left, and also what we take to be the meaning of the words “Be not righteous overmuch”? We turn to the left if, following the lust of Jews and Gentiles, we burn for sexual intercourse; we turn to the right if, following the error of the Manichæans, we under a pretence of chastity entangle ourselves in the meshes of unchastity. But we keep to the Kings highway if we aspire to virginity yet refrain from condemning marriage. Can any one, moreover, be so unfair in his criticism of my poor treatise as to allege that I condemn first marriages, when he reads my opinion on second ones as follows: <a name="fr_1094"></a><a href="#fn_1094"><font size="1">1095</font></a>
  “The apostle, it is true, allows second marriages, but only to such women as are bent upon them, to such as cannot contain, <a name="fr_1095"></a><a href="#fn_1095"><font size="1">1096</font></a>
  lest when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ they marry, having condemnation because they have rejected their first faith, <a name="fr_1096"></a><a href="#fn_1096"><font size="1">1097</font></a>
  and he makes this concession because many are turned aside after Satan. <a name="fr_1097"></a><a href="#fn_1097"><font size="1">1098</font></a>
  But they will be happier if they abide as widows. To this he immediately adds his apostolical authority, after my judgment. Moreover, lest any should consider that authority, being human, to be of small weight, he goes on to say, and I think also that I have the spirit of God. <a name="fr_1098"></a><a href="#fn_1098"><font size="1">1099</font></a>
  Thus, where he urges men to continence he appeals not to human authority, but to the Spirit of God; but when he gives them permission to marry he does not mention the Spirit of God, but allows prudential considerations to turn the balance, relaxing the strictness of his code in favor of individuals according to their several needs.” Having thus brought forward proofs that second marriages are allowed by the apostle, we at once added the remarks which follow: <a name="fr_1099"></a><a href="#fn_1099"><font size="1">1100</font></a>
  “As marriage is permitted to virgins by reason of the danger of fornication, and as what in itself is not desirable is thus made excusable, so by reason of the same danger widows are permitted to marry a second time. For it is better that a woman should know one man (though he should be a second husband or a third) than that she should know several. In other words, it is preferable that she should prostitute herself to one rather than to many.” Calumny may do its worst. We have spoken here not of a first marriage, but of a second, of a third, or (if you like) of a fourth. But lest any one should apply my words (that it is better for a woman to prostitute herself to one man than to several) to a first marriage when my whole argument dealt with digamy and trigamy, I marked my own view of these practices with the words: <a name="fr_1100"></a><a href="#fn_1100"><font size="1">1101</font></a>
  “All things are lawful, but all things are not expedient. <a name="fr_1101"></a><a href="#fn_1101"><font size="1">1102</font></a>
  I do not condemn digamists nor yet trigamists, nor even, to put an extreme, case, octogamists. I will make a still greater concession: I am ready to receive even a whore-monger, if penitent. In every case where fairness is possible, fair consideration must be shown.”</p>  
 <p><a name="v.XLVIII-p77"></a>9. My calumniator should blush at his assertion that I condemn first marriages when he reads my words just now quoted: “I do not condemn digamists or trigamists, or even, to put an extreme case, octogamists.” Not to condemn is one thing, to commend is another. I may concede a practice as allowable and yet not praise it as meritorious. But if I seem severe in saying, “In every case where fairness is possible, fair consideration must be shown,” no one, I fancy, will judge me either cruel or stern who reads that the places prepared for virgins and for wedded persons are different from those prepared for trigamists, octogamists, and penitents. That Christ Himself, although in the flesh a virgin, was in the spirit a monogamist, <a name="page_71"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 71</font></a> <a name="v.XLVIII-Page_71"></a>having one wife, even the Church, <a name="fr_1102"></a><a href="#fn_1102"><font size="1">1103</font></a>
  I have shown in the latter part of my argument. <a name="fr_1103"></a><a href="#fn_1103"><font size="1">1104</font></a>
  And yet I am supposed to condemn marriage! I am said to condemn it, although I use such words as these: <a name="fr_1104"></a><a href="#fn_1104"><font size="1">1105</font></a>
  “It is an undoubted fact that the levitical priests were descended from the stock of Aaron, Eleazar, and Phinehas; and, as all these were married men, we might well be confronted with them if, led away by the error of the Encratites, we were to contend that marriage is in itself deserving of condemnation.” Here I blame Tatian, the chief of the Encratites, for his rejection of marriage, and yet I myself am said to condemn it! Once more, when I contrast virgins with widows, my own words show what my view is concerning wedlock, and set forth the threefold gradation which I propose of virgins, widows—whether in practice or in fact <a name="fr_1105"></a><a href="#fn_1105"><font size="1">1106</font></a>
 —and wedded wives. “I do not deny”—these are my words <a name="fr_1106"></a><a href="#fn_1106"><font size="1">1107</font></a>
 —“the blessedness of widows who continue such after their baptism, nor do I undervalue the merit of wives who live in chastity with their husbands; but, just as widows receive a greater reward from God than wives obedient to their husbands, they, too, must be content to see virgins preferred before themselves.”</p>  
 <p><a name="v.XLVIII-p83"></a>10. Again, when explaining the witness of the apostle to the Galatians, “By the works of the law shall no flesh be justified,” I have spoken to the following effect: “Marriages also are works of the law. And for this reason there is a curse upon such as do not produce offspring. They are permitted, it is true, even under the Gospel; but it is one thing to concede an indulgence to what is a weakness and quite another to promise a reward to what is a virtue.” See my express declaration that marriage is allowed in the Gospel, yet that those who are married cannot receive the rewards of chastity so long as they render their due one to another. If married men feel indignant at this statement, let them vent their anger not on me but on the Holy Scriptures; nay, more, upon all bishops, presbyters, and deacons, and the whole company of priests and levites, who know that they cannot offer sacrifices if they fulfil the obligations of marriage. Again, when I adduce evidence from the Apocalypse, <a name="fr_1107"></a><a href="#fn_1107"><font size="1">1108</font></a>
  is it not clear what view I take concerning virgins, widows, and wives? “These are they who sing a new song <a name="fr_1108"></a><a href="#fn_1108"><font size="1">1109</font></a>
  which no man can sing except he be a virgin. These are the first fruits unto God and unto the Lamb, <a name="fr_1109"></a><a href="#fn_1109"><font size="1">1110</font></a>
  and they are without spot. If virgins are the first fruits unto God, then widows and wives who live in continence must come after the first fruits—that is to say, in the second place and in the third.” We place widows, then, and wives in the second place and in the third, and for this we are charged by the frenzy of a heretic with condemning marriage altogether.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.XLVIII-p87"></a>11. Throughout the book I have made many remarks in a tone of great moderation on virginity, widowhood, and marriage. But for the sake of brevity, I will here adduce but one passage, and that of such a kind that no one, I think, will be found to gainsay it save some one who wishes to prove himself malicious or mad. In describing our Lords visit to the marriage at Cana in Galilee, <a name="fr_1110"></a><a href="#fn_1110"><font size="1">1111</font></a>
  after some other remarks I have added these: <a name="fr_1111"></a><a href="#fn_1111"><font size="1">1112</font></a>
  “He who went but once to a marriage has taught us that a woman should marry but once; and this fact might tell against virginity if we failed to give marriage its due place—after virginity that is, and chaste widowhood. But, as it is only heretics who condemn marriage and tread under foot the ordinance of God, we listen with gladness to every word said by our Lord in praise of marriage. For the Church does not condemn marriage, but only subordinates it. It does not reject it altogether, but regulates it, knowing (as I have said above) that in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honor and some to dishonor. If a man, therefore, purge himself…he shall be a vessel unto honor meet…and prepared unto every good work.” <a name="fr_1112"></a><a href="#fn_1112"><font size="1">1113</font></a>
  I listen with gladness, I say here, to every word said by the apostle in praise of marriage. Do I listen with gladness to the praise of marriage, and do I yet condemn marriage? The Church, I say, does not condemn wedlock, but subordinates it. Whether you like it or not, marriage is subordinated to virginity and widowhood. Even when marriage continues to fulfil its function, the Church does not condemn it, but only subordinates it; it does not reject it, but only regulates it. It is in your power, if you will, to mount the second step of chastity. <a name="fr_1113"></a><a href="#fn_1113"><font size="1">1114</font></a>
  Why are you angry if, standing on the third and lowest step, you will not make haste to go up higher?</p>  
 <p class="c27"><a name="v.XLVIII-p92"></a>12. Since, then, I have so often reminded my reader of my views; and since I have picked <a name="page_72"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 72</font></a> <a name="v.XLVIII-Page_72"></a>my way like a prudent traveller over every inch of the road, stating repeatedly that, while I receive marriage as a thing in itself admissible, I yet prefer continence, widowhood, and virginity, the wise and generous reader ought to have judged what seemed hard sayings by my general drift, and not to have charged me with putting forward inconsistent opinions in one and the same book. For who is so dull or so inexperienced in writing as to praise and to condemn one and the same object, as to destroy what he has built up, and to build up what he has destroyed; and when he has vanquished his opponent, to turn his sword, last of all against himself? Were my detractors country bred or unacquainted with the arts of rhetoric or of logic, I should pardon their want of insight; nor should I censure them for accusing me if I saw that their ignorance was in fault and not their will. As it is men of intellect who have enjoyed a liberal education make it their object less to understand me than to wound me, and for such I have this short answer, that they should correct my faults and not merely censure me for them. The lists are open, I cry; your enemy has marshalled his forces, his position is plain, and (if I may quote Virgil <a name="fr_1114"></a><a href="#fn_1114"><font size="1">1115</font></a>
 )—</p>  
 <p class="c34"><a name="v.XLVIII-p94"></a>The foeman calls you: meet him face to face.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.XLVIII-p95"></a>Such men should answer their opponent. They ought to keep within the limits of debate, and not to wield the schoolmasters rod. Their books should aim at showing in what my statements have fallen short of the truth, and in what they have exceeded it. For, although I will not listen to fault-finders, I will follow the advice of teachers. To direct the fighter how to fight when you yourself occupy a post of vantage on the wall is a kind of teaching that does not commend itself; and when you are yourself bathed in perfumes, it is unworthy to charge a bleeding soldier with cowardice. Nor in saying this do I lay myself open to a charge of boasting that while others have slept I only have entered the lists. My meaning simply is that men who have seen me wounded in this warfare may possibly be a little too cautious in their methods of fighting. I would not have you engage in an encounter in which you will have nothing to do but to protect yourself, your right hand remaining motionless while your left manages your shield. You must either strike or fall. I cannot account you a victor unless I see your opponent put to the sword.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.XLVIII-p96"></a>13. You are, no doubt, men of vast acquirements; but we too have studied in the schools, and, like you, we have learned from the precepts of Aristotle—or, rather, from those which he has derived from Gorgias—that there are different ways of speaking; and we know, among other things, that he who writes for display uses one style, and he who writes to convince, another. <a name="fr_1115"></a><a href="#fn_1115"><font size="1">1116</font></a>
  In the former case the debate is desultory; to confute the opposer, now this argument is adduced and now that. One argues as one pleases, saying one thing while one means another. To quote the proverb, “With one hand one offers bread, in the other one holds a stone.” <a name="fr_1116"></a><a href="#fn_1116"><font size="1">1117</font></a>
  In the latter case a certain frankness and openness of countenance are necessary. For it is one thing to start a problem and another to expound what is already proved. The first calls for a disputant, the second for a teacher. I stand in the thick of the fray, my life in constant danger: you who profess to teach me are a man of books. “Do not,” you say, “attack unexpectedly or wound by a side-thrust. Strike straight at your opponent. You should be ashamed to resort to feints instead of force.” As if it were not the perfection of fighting to menace one part and to strike another. Read, I beg of you, Demosthenes or Cicero, or (if you do not care for pleaders whose aim is to speak plausibly rather than truly) read Plato, Theophrastus, Xenophon, Aristotle, and the rest of those who draw their respective rills of wisdom from the Socratic fountain-head. Do they show any openness? Are they devoid of artifice? Is not every word they say filled with meaning? And does not this meaning always make for victory? Origen, Methodius, Eusebius, and Apollinaris <a name="fr_1117"></a><a href="#fn_1117"><font size="1">1118</font></a>
  write at great length against Celsus and Porphyry. <a name="fr_1118"></a><a href="#fn_1118"><font size="1">1119</font></a>
  Consider how subtle are the arguments, how insidious the engines with which they overthrow what the spirit of the devil has wrought. Sometimes, it is true, they are compelled to say not what they think but what is needful; and for this reason they employ against their opponents the assertions of the Gentiles themselves. I say nothing of the Latin authors, of Tertullian, Cyprian, Minutius, Victorinus, Lactantius, Hilary, lest I should appear not so much to be defending myself as to be assailing <a name="page_73"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 73</font></a> <a name="v.XLVIII-Page_73"></a>others. I will only mention the Apostle Paul, whose words seem to me, as often as I hear them, to be not words, but peals of thunder. Read his epistles, and especially those addressed to the Romans, to the Galatians, and to the Ephesians, in all of which he stands in the thick of the battle, and you will see how skilful and how careful he is in the proofs which he draws from the Old Testament, and how warily he cloaks the object which he has in view. His words seem simplicity itself: the expressions of a guileless and unsophisticated person—one who has no skill either to plan a dilemma or to avoid it. Still, whichever way you look, they are thunderbolts. His pleading halts, yet he carries every point which he takes up. He turns his back upon his foe only to overcome him; he simulates flight, but only that he may slay. He, then, if any one, ought to be calumniated; we should speak thus to him: “The proofs which you have used against the Jews or against other heretics bear a different meaning in their own contexts to that which they bear in your epistles. We see passages taken captive by your pen and pressed into service to win you a victory which in the volumes from which they are taken have no controversial bearing at all.” May he not reply to us in the words of the Saviour: “I have one mode of speech for those that are without and another for those that are within; the crowds hear my parables, but their interpretation is for my disciples alone”? <a name="fr_1119"></a><a href="#fn_1119"><font size="1">1120</font></a>
  The Lord puts questions to the Pharisees, but does not elucidate them. To teach a disciple is one thing; to vanquish an opponent, another. “My mystery is for me,” says the prophet; “my mystery is for me and for them that are mine.” <a name="fr_1120"></a><a href="#fn_1120"><font size="1">1121</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="v.XLVIII-p103"></a>14. You are indignant with me because I have merely silenced Jovinian and not instructed him. You, do I say? Nay, rather, they who grieve to hear him anathematized, and who impeach their own pretended orthodoxy by eulogizing in another the heresy which they hold themselves. I should have asked him, forsooth, to surrender peaceably! I had no right to disregard his struggles and to drag him against his will into the bonds of truth! I might use such language had the desire of victory induced me to say anything counter to the rule laid down in Scripture, and had I taken the line—so often adopted by strong men in controversy—of justifying the means by the result. As it is, however, I have been an exponent of the apostle rather than a dogmatist on my own account; and my function has been simply that of a commentator. Anything, therefore, which seems a hard saying should be imputed to the writer expounded by me rather than to me the expounder; unless, indeed, he spoke otherwise than he is represented to have done, and I have by an unfair interpretation wrested the plain meaning of his words. If any one charges me with this disingenuousness let him prove his charge from the Scriptures themselves.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.XLVIII-p104"></a>I have said in my book, <a name="fr_1121"></a><a href="#fn_1121"><font size="1">1122</font></a>
  “If it is good for a man not to touch a woman, then it is bad for him to touch one, for bad, and bad only, is the opposite of good. But, if though bad it is made venial, then it is allowed to prevent something which would be worse than bad,” and so on down to the commencement of the next chapter. The above is my comment upon the apostles words: “It is good for a man not to touch a woman. Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.” <a name="fr_1122"></a><a href="#fn_1122"><font size="1">1123</font></a>
  In what way does my meaning differ from that intended by the apostle? Except that where he speaks decidedly I do so with hesitation. He defines a dogma, I hazard an inquiry. He openly says: “It is good for a man not to touch a woman.” I timidly ask <i>if</i> it is good for a man not to touch one. If I thus waver, I cannot be said to speak positively. He says: “It is good not to touch.” I add what is a possible antithesis to “good.” And immediately afterwards I speak thus: <a name="fr_1123"></a><a href="#fn_1123"><font size="1">1124</font></a>
  “Notice the apostles carefulness. He does not say: It is good for a man not to have a wife, but, It is good for a man not to touch a woman; as if there is danger in the very touching of one—danger which he who touches cannot escape.” You see, therefore, that I am not expounding the law as to husbands and wives, but simply discussing the general question of sexual intercourse—how in comparison with chastity and virginity, the life of angels, “It is good for a man not to touch a woman.”</p>  
 <p><a name="v.XLVIII-p108"></a>“Vanity of vanities,” says the Preacher, “all is vanity.” <a name="fr_1124"></a><a href="#fn_1124"><font size="1">1125</font></a>
  But if all created things are good, <a name="fr_1125"></a><a href="#fn_1125"><font size="1">1126</font></a>
  as being the handiwork of a good Creator, how comes it that all things are vanity? If the earth is vanity, are the heavens vanity too?—and the angels, the thrones, the dominations, the powers, and the rest of the virtues? <a name="fr_1126"></a><a href="#fn_1126"><font size="1">1127</font></a>
  No; if things which are <a name="page_74"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 74</font></a> <a name="v.XLVIII-Page_74"></a>good in themselves as being the handiwork of a good Creator are called vanity, it is because they are compared with things which are better still. For example, compared with a lamp, a lantern is good for nothing; compared with a star, a lamp does not shine at all; the brightest star pales before the moon; put the moon beside the sun, and it no longer looks bright; compare the sun with Christ, and it is darkness. “I am that I am,” God says; <a name="fr_1127"></a><a href="#fn_1127"><font size="1">1128</font></a>
  and if you compare all created things with Him they have no existence. “Give not thy sceptre,” says Esther, “unto them that be nothing” <a name="fr_1128"></a><a href="#fn_1128"><font size="1">1129</font></a>
 —that is to say, to idols and demons. And certainly they were idols and demons to whom she prayed that she and hers might not be given over. In Job also we read how Bildad says of the wicked man: “His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and destruction as a king shall trample upon him. The companions also of him who is not shall abide in his tabernacle.” <a name="fr_1129"></a><a href="#fn_1129"><font size="1">1130</font></a>
  This evidently relates to the devil, who must be in existence, otherwise he could not be said to have companions. Still, because he is lost to God, he is said not to be.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.XLVIII-p115"></a>Now it was in a similar sense that I declared it to be a bad thing to touch a woman—I did not say a wife—because it is a good thing not to touch one. And I added: <a name="fr_1130"></a><a href="#fn_1130"><font size="1">1131</font></a>
  “I call virginity fine corn, wedlock barley, and fornication cow-dung.” Surely both corn and barley are creatures of God. But of the two multitudes miraculously supplied in the Gospel the larger was fed upon barley loaves, and the smaller on corn bread. <a name="fr_1131"></a><a href="#fn_1131"><font size="1">1132</font></a>
  “Thou, Lord,” says the psalmist, “shalt save both man and beast.” <a name="fr_1132"></a><a href="#fn_1132"><font size="1">1133</font></a>
  I have myself said the same thing in other words, when I have spoken of virginity as gold and of wedlock as silver. <a name="fr_1133"></a><a href="#fn_1133"><font size="1">1134</font></a>
  Again, in discussing <a name="fr_1134"></a><a href="#fn_1134"><font size="1">1135</font></a>
  the one hundred and forty-four thousand sealed virgins who were not defiled with women, <a name="fr_1135"></a><a href="#fn_1135"><font size="1">1136</font></a>
  I have tried to show that all who have not remained virgins are reckoned as defiled when compared with the perfect chastity of the angels and of our Lord Jesus Christ. But if any one thinks it hard or reprehensible that I have placed the same interval between virginity and wedlock as there is between fine corn and barley, let him read the book of the holy Ambrose “On Widows,” and he will find, among other statements concerning virginity and marriage, the following: <a name="fr_1136"></a><a href="#fn_1136"><font size="1">1137</font></a>
  “The apostle has not expressed his preference for marriage so unreservedly as to quench in men the aspiration after virginity; he commences with a recommendation of continence, and it is only subsequently that he stoops to mention the remedies for its opposite. And although to the strong he has pointed out the prize of their high calling, <a name="fr_1137"></a><a href="#fn_1137"><font size="1">1138</font></a>
  yet he suffers none to faint by the way; <a name="fr_1138"></a><a href="#fn_1138"><font size="1">1139</font></a>
  whilst he applauds those who lead the van, he does not despise those who bring up the rear. For he had himself learned that the Lord Jesus gave to some barley bread, lest they should faint by the way, but offered to others His own body, that they should strive to attain His kingdom;” <a name="fr_1139"></a><a href="#fn_1139"><font size="1">1140</font></a>
  and immediately afterwards: “The nuptial tie, then, is not to be avoided as a crime, but to be refused as a hard burden. For the law binds the wife to bring forth children in labor and in sorrow. Her desire is to be to her husband that he should rule over her. <a name="fr_1140"></a><a href="#fn_1140"><font size="1">1141</font></a>
  It is not the widow, then, but the bride, who is handed over to labor and sorrow in childbearing. It is not the virgin, but the married woman, who is subjected to the sway of a husband.” And in another place, “Ye are bought,” says the apostle, “with a price; <a name="fr_1141"></a><a href="#fn_1141"><font size="1">1142</font></a>
  be not therefore the servants of men.” <a name="fr_1142"></a><a href="#fn_1142"><font size="1">1143</font></a>
  You see how clearly he defines the servitude which attends the married state. And a little farther on: “If, then, even a good marriage is servitude, what must a bad one be, in which husband and wife cannot sanctify, but only mutually destroy each other?” What I have said about virginity and marriage diffusely, Ambrose has stated tersely and pointedly, compressing much meaning into a few words. Virginity is described by him as a means of recommending continence, marriage as a remedy for incontinence. And when he descends from broad principles to particular details, he significantly holds out to virgins the prize of the high calling, yet comforts the married, that they may not faint by the way. While eulogizing the one class, he does not despise the other. Marriage he compares to the barley bread set before the multitude, virginity to the body of Christ given to the disciples. There is much less difference, it seems to me, between barley and fine corn than between barley and the body of Christ. Finally, he speaks of marriage as a hard burden, to be avoided if possible, and as a badge of the most unmistakable servi<a name="page_75"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 75</font></a> <a name="v.XLVIII-Page_75"></a>tude. He makes, also, many other statements, which he has followed up at length in his three books “On Virgins.”</p>  
 <p><a name="v.XLVIII-p129"></a>15. From all which considerations it is clear that I have said nothing at all new concerning virginity and marriage, but have followed in all respects the judgment of older writers—of Ambrose, that is to say, and others who have discussed the doctrines of the Church. “And I would sooner follow them in their faults than copy the dull pedantry of the writers of to-day.” <a name="fr_1143"></a><a href="#fn_1143"><font size="1">1144</font></a>
  Let married men, if they please, swell with rage because I have said, <a name="fr_1144"></a><a href="#fn_1144"><font size="1">1145</font></a>
  “I ask you, what kind of good thing is that which forbids a man to pray, and which prevents him from receiving the body of Christ?” When I do my duty as a husband, I cannot fulfil the requirements of continence. The same apostle, in another place, commands us to pray always. <a name="fr_1145"></a><a href="#fn_1145"><font size="1">1146</font></a>
  “But if we are always to pray we must never yield to the claims of wedlock for, as often as I render her due to my wife, I incapacitate myself for prayer.” When I spoke thus it is clear that I relied on the words of the apostle: “Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to…prayer.” <a name="fr_1146"></a><a href="#fn_1146"><font size="1">1147</font></a>
  The Apostle Paul tells us that when we have intercourse with our wives we cannot pray. If, then, sexual intercourse prevents what is less important—that is, prayer—how much more does it prevent what is more important—that is, the reception of the body of Christ? Peter, too, exhorts us to continence, that our “prayers be not hindered.” <a name="fr_1147"></a><a href="#fn_1147"><font size="1">1148</font></a>
  How, I should like to know, have I sinned in all this? What have I done? How have I been in fault? If the waters of a stream are thick and muddy, it is not the river-bed which is to blame, but the source. Am I attacked because I have ventured to add to the words of the apostle these words of my own: “What kind of good thing is that which prevents a man from receiving the body of Christ?” If so, I will make answer briefly thus: Which is the more important, to pray or to receive Christs body? Surely to receive Christs body. If, then, sexual intercourse hinders the less important thing, much more does it hinder that which is the more important.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.XLVIII-p135"></a>I have said in the same treatise <a name="fr_1148"></a><a href="#fn_1148"><font size="1">1149</font></a>
  that David and they that were with him could not have lawfully eaten the shew-bread had they not made answer that for three days they had not been defiled with women <a name="fr_1149"></a><a href="#fn_1149"><font size="1">1150</font></a>
 —not, of course, with harlots, intercourse with whom was forbidden by the law, but with their own wives, to whom they were lawfully united. Moreover, when the people were about to receive the law on Mount Sinai they were commanded to keep away from their wives for three days. <a name="fr_1150"></a><a href="#fn_1150"><font size="1">1151</font></a>
  I know that at Rome it is customary for the faithful always to receive the body of Christ, a custom which I neither censure nor indorse. “Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.” <a name="fr_1151"></a><a href="#fn_1151"><font size="1">1152</font></a>
  But I appeal to the consciences of those persons who after indulging in sexual intercourse on the same day receive the communion—having first, as Persius puts it, “washed off the night in a flowing stream,” <a name="fr_1152"></a><a href="#fn_1152"><font size="1">1153</font></a>
  and I ask such why they do not presume to approach the martyrs or to enter the churches. <a name="fr_1153"></a><a href="#fn_1153"><font size="1">1154</font></a>
  Is Christ of one mind abroad and of another at home? What is unlawful in church cannot be lawful at home. Nothing is hidden from God. “The night shineth as the day” before Him. <a name="fr_1154"></a><a href="#fn_1154"><font size="1">1155</font></a>
  Let each man examine himself, and so let him approach the body of Christ. <a name="fr_1155"></a><a href="#fn_1155"><font size="1">1156</font></a>
  Not, of course, that the deferring of communion for one day or for two makes a Christian any the holier or that what I have not deserved to-day I shall deserve to-morrow or the day after. But if I grieve that I have not shared in Christs body it does help me to avoid for a little while my wifes embraces, and to prefer to wedded love the love of Christ. A hard discipline, you will say, and one not to be borne. What man of the world could bear it? He that can bear it, I reply, let him bear it; <a name="fr_1156"></a><a href="#fn_1156"><font size="1">1157</font></a>
  he that cannot must look to himself. It is my business to say, not what each man can do or will do, but what the Scriptures inculcate.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.XLVIII-p145"></a>16. Again, objection has been taken to my comments on the apostle in the following passage: <a name="fr_1157"></a><a href="#fn_1157"><font size="1">1158</font></a>
  “But lest any should suppose from the context of the words before quoted (namely, that ye may give yourselves…to prayer and come together again) that <a name="page_76"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 76</font></a> <a name="v.XLVIII-Page_76"></a>the apostle desires this consummation, and does not merely concede it to obviate a worse downfall, he immediately adds, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency. <a name="fr_1158"></a><a href="#fn_1158"><font size="1">1159</font></a>
  And come together again. What a noble indulgence the words convey! One which he blushes to speak of in plainer words, which he prefers only to Satans temptation, and which has its root in incontinence. Do we labor to expound this as a dark saying when the writer has himself explained his meaning? “I speak this,” he says, by way of permission, and not as a command. <a name="fr_1159"></a><a href="#fn_1159"><font size="1">1160</font></a>
  Do we still hesitate to speak of wedlock as a thing permitted instead of as a thing enjoined? or are we afraid that such permission will exclude second or third marriages or some other case?” What have I said here which the apostle has not said? The phrase, I suppose, “which he blushes to speak of in plainer words.” I imagine that when he says “come together,” and does not mention for what, he takes a modest way of indicating what he does not like to name openly—that is, sexual intercourse. Or is the objection to the words which follow—“which he prefers only to Satans temptation, and which has its root in incontinence”? Are they not the very words of the apostle, only differently arranged—“that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency”? Or do people cavil because I said, “Do we still hesitate to speak of wedlock as a thing permitted instead of as a thing enjoined?” If this seems a hard saying, it should be ascribed to the apostle, who says, “But I speak this by way of permission, and not as a command,” and not to me, who, except that I have rearranged their order, have changed neither the words nor their meaning.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.XLVIII-p149"></a>17. The shortness of a letter compels me to hasten on. I pass, accordingly, to the points which remain. “I say,” remarks the apostle, “to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I. But if they cannot contain, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to burn.” <a name="fr_1160"></a><a href="#fn_1160"><font size="1">1161</font></a>
  This section I have interpreted thus: <a name="fr_1161"></a><a href="#fn_1161"><font size="1">1162</font></a>
  “When he has granted to those who are married the use of wedlock, and has made clear his own wishes and concessions, he passes on to those who are unmarried or widows, and sets before them his own example. He calls them happy if they abide even as he, <a name="fr_1162"></a><a href="#fn_1162"><font size="1">1163</font></a>
  but he goes on, if they cannot contain, let them marry. He thus repeats his former language, but only to avoid fornication, and that Satan tempt you not for your incontinence. And when he says, If they cannot contain, let them marry, he gives as a reason for his words that it is better to marry than to burn. It is only good to marry, because it is bad to burn. But take away the fire of lust, and he will not say it is better to marry. For a thing is said to be better in antithesis to something which is worse, and not simply in contrast with what is admittedly good. It is as though he said, It is better to have one eye than none.” Shortly afterwards, apostrophizing the apostle, I spoke thus: <a name="fr_1163"></a><a href="#fn_1163"><font size="1">1164</font></a>
  “If marriage is good in itself, do not compare it with a conflagration, but simply say, It is good to marry. I must suspect the goodness of a thing which only becomes a lesser evil in the presence of a greater one. I, for my part, would have it not a lighter evil but a downright good.” The apostle wishes unmarried women and widows to abstain from sexual intercourse, incites them to follow his own example, and calls them happy if they abide even as he. But if they cannot contain, and are tempted to quench the fire of lust by fornication rather than by continence, it is better, he tells them, to marry than to burn. Upon which precept I have made this comment: “It is good to marry, simply because it is bad to burn,” not putting forward a view of my own, but only explaining the apostles precept, “It is better to marry than to burn;” that is, it is better to take a husband than to commit fornication. If, then, you teach that burning or fornication is good, the good will still be surpassed by what is still better. <a name="fr_1164"></a><a href="#fn_1164"><font size="1">1165</font></a>
  But if marriage is only a degree better than the evil to which it is preferred, it cannot be of that unblemished perfection and blessedness which suggest a comparison with the life of angels. Suppose I say, “It is better to be a virgin than a married woman;” in this case I have preferred to what is good what is still better. But suppose I go a step further and say, “It is better to marry than to commit fornication;” in that case I have preferred, not a better thing to a good thing, but a good thing to a bad one. There is a wide difference between the two cases; for, while virginity is related to marriage as better is to good, marriage is related to fornication as good is to bad. How, I should like to know, have I sinned in this explanation? My fixed purpose was not to bend the Scriptures to my own wishes, but simply to <a name="page_77"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 77</font></a> <a name="v.XLVIII-Page_77"></a>say what I took to be their meaning. A commentator has no business to dilate on his own views; his duty is to make plain the meaning of the author whom he professes to interpret. For, if he contradicts the writer whom he is trying to expound, he will prove to be his opponent rather than his interpreter. When I am freely expressing my own opinion, and not commenting upon the Scriptures, then any one that pleases may charge me with having spoken hardly of marriage. But if he can find no ground for such a charge, he should attribute such passages in my commentaries as appear severe or harsh to the author commented on, and not to me, who am only his interpreter.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.XLVIII-p155"></a>18. Another charge brought against me is simply intolerable! It is urged that in explaining the apostles words concerning husbands and wives, “Such shall have trouble in the flesh,” I have said: <a name="fr_1165"></a><a href="#fn_1165"><font size="1">1166</font></a>
  “We in our ignorance had supposed that in the flesh at least wedlock would have rejoicing. But if married persons are to have trouble in the flesh, the only thing in which they seemed likely to have pleasure, what motive will be left to make women marry? for, besides having trouble in spirit and soul, they will also have it even in the flesh.” <a name="fr_1166"></a><a href="#fn_1166"><font size="1">1167</font></a>
  Do I condemn marriage if I enumerate its troubles, such as the crying of infants, the death of children, the chance of abortion, domestic losses, and so forth? Whilst Damasus of holy memory was still living, I wrote a book against Helvidius “On the Perpetual Virginity of the Blessed Mary,” in which, duly to extol the bliss of virginity, I was forced to say much of the troubles of marriage. Did that excellent man—versed in Scripture as he was, and a virgin doctor of the virgin Church—find anything to censure in my discourse? Moreover, in the treatise which I addressed to Eustochium <a name="fr_1167"></a><a href="#fn_1167"><font size="1">1168</font></a>
  I used much harsher language regarding marriage, and yet no one was offended at it. Nay, every lover of chastity strained his ears to catch my eulogy of continence. Read Tertullian, read Cyprian, read Ambrose, and either accuse me with them or acquit me with them. My critics resemble the characters of Plautus. Their only wit lies in detraction; and they try to make themselves out men of learning by assailing all parties in turn. Thus they bestow their censure impartially upon myself and upon my opponent, and maintain that we are both beaten, although one or other of us must have succeeded.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.XLVIII-p159"></a>Moreover, when in discussing digamy and trigamy I have said, <a name="fr_1168"></a><a href="#fn_1168"><font size="1">1169</font></a>
  “It is better for a woman to know one man, even though he be a second husband or a third, than several; it is more tolerable for her to prostitute herself to one man than to many,” have I not immediately subjoined my reason for so saying? “The Samaritan woman in the Gospel, when she declares that her present husband is her sixth, is rebuked by the Lord on the ground that he is not her husband.” <a name="fr_1169"></a><a href="#fn_1169"><font size="1">1170</font></a>
  For my own part, I now once more freely proclaim that digamy is not condemned in the Church—no, nor yet trigamy—and that a woman may marry a fifth husband, or a sixth, or a greater number still just as lawfully as she may marry a second; but that, while such marriages are not condemned, neither are they commended. They are meant as alleviations of an unhappy lot, and in no way redound to the glory of continence. I have spoken to the same effect elsewhere. <a name="fr_1170"></a><a href="#fn_1170"><font size="1">1171</font></a>
  “When a woman marries more than once—whether she does so twice or three times matters little—she ceases to be a monogamist. All things are lawful…but all things are not expedient. <a name="fr_1171"></a><a href="#fn_1171"><font size="1">1172</font></a>
  I do not condemn digamists or trigamists, or even, to put an impossible case, octogamists. Let a woman have an eighth husband if she must; only let her cease to prostitute herself.”</p>  
 <p><a name="v.XLVIII-p164"></a>19. I will come now to the passage in which I am accused of saying that—at least according to the true Hebrew text—the words “God saw that it was good” <a name="fr_1172"></a><a href="#fn_1172"><font size="1">1173</font></a>
  are not inserted after the second day of the creation, as they are after the first, third, and remaining ones, and of adding immediately the following comment: <a name="fr_1173"></a><a href="#fn_1173"><font size="1">1174</font></a>
  “We are meant to understand that there is something not good in the number two, separating us as it does from unity, and prefiguring the marriage-tie. Just as in the account of Noahs ark all the animals that enter by twos are unclean, but those of which an uneven number is taken are clean.” <a name="fr_1174"></a><a href="#fn_1174"><font size="1">1175</font></a>
  In this statement a passing objection is made to what I have said concerning the second day, whether on the ground that the words mentioned really occur in the passage, although I say that they do not occur, or because, assuming them to occur, I have understood them in a sense different from that which the context evidently requires. As regards the non-occurrence of the words in question (viz., “God saw that it was good”), let them take not my evidence, but that of all the Jew<a name="page_78"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 78</font></a> <a name="v.XLVIII-Page_78"></a>ish and other translators—Aquila <a name="fr_1175"></a><a href="#fn_1175"><font size="1">1176</font></a>
  namely, Symmachus, <a name="fr_1176"></a><a href="#fn_1176"><font size="1">1177</font></a>
  and Theodotion. <a name="fr_1177"></a><a href="#fn_1177"><font size="1">1178</font></a>
  But if the words, although occurring in the account of the other days, do not occur in the account of this, either let them give a more plausible reason than I have done for their non-occurrence, or, failing such, let them, whether they like it or not, accept the suggestion which I have made. Furthermore, if in Noahs ark all the animals that enter by twos are unclean, whilst those of which an uneven number is taken are clean, and if there is no dispute about the accuracy of the text, let them explain if they can why it is so written. But if they cannot explain it, then, whether they will or not, they must embrace my explanation of the matter. Either produce better fare and ask me to be your guest, or else rest content with the meal that I offer you, however poor it may be. <a name="fr_1178"></a><a href="#fn_1178"><font size="1">1179</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c27"><a name="v.XLVIII-p172"></a>I must now mention the ecclesiastical writers who have dealt with this question of the odd number. They are, among the Greeks, Clement, Hippolytus, Origen, Dionysius, Eusebius, Didymus; and, among ourselves, Tertullian, Cyprian, Victorinus, Lactantius, Hilary. What Cyprian said to Fortunatus about the number seven is clear from the letter which he sent to him. <a name="fr_1179"></a><a href="#fn_1179"><font size="1">1180</font></a>
  Or perhaps I ought to bring forward the reasonings of Pythagoras, Archytas of Tarentum, and Publius Scipio in (Ciceros) sixth book “Concerning the Common Weal.” If my detractors will not listen to any of these I will make the grammar schools shout in their ears the words of Virgil:</p>  
 <p class="c27"><a name="v.XLVIII-p174"></a>Uneven numbers are the joy of God. <a name="fr_1180"></a><a href="#fn_1180"><font size="1">1181</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c27"><a name="v.XLVIII-p176"></a>20. To say, as I have done, that virginity is cleaner than wedlock, that the even numbers must give way to the odd, that the types of the Old Testament establish the truth of the Gospel: this, it appears, is a great sin subversive of the churches and intolerable to the world. The remaining points which are censured in my treatise are, I take it, of less importance, or else resolve themselves into this. I have, therefore, refrained from answering them, both that I may not exceed the limit at my disposal, and that I may not seem to distrust your intelligence, knowing as I do that you are ready to be my champion even before I ask you. With my last breath, then, I protest that neither now nor at any former time have I condemned marriage. I have merely answered an opponent without any fear that they of my own party would lay snares for me. I extol virginity to the skies, not because I myself possess it, but because, not possessing it, I admire it all the more. Surely it is a modest and ingenuous confession to praise in others that which you lack yourself. The weight of my body keeps me fixed to the ground, but do I fail to admire the flying birds or to praise the dove because, in the words of Virgil, <a name="fr_1181"></a><a href="#fn_1181"><font size="1">1182</font></a>
  it</p>  
 <p class="c34"><a name="v.XLVIII-p178"></a>Glides on its liquid path with motionless swift wings?</p>  
 <p><a name="v.XLVIII-p179"></a>Let no man deceive himself, let no man, giving ear to the voice of flattery, rush upon ruin. The first virginity man derives from his birth, the second from his second birth. <a name="fr_1182"></a><a href="#fn_1182"><font size="1">1183</font></a>
  The words are not mine; it is an old saying, “No man can serve two masters;” <a name="fr_1183"></a><a href="#fn_1183"><font size="1">1184</font></a>
  that is, the flesh and the spirit. For “the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary the one to the other,” so that we cannot do the things that we would. <a name="fr_1184"></a><a href="#fn_1184"><font size="1">1185</font></a>
  When, then, anything in my little work seems to you harsh, have regard not to my words, but to the Scripture, whence they are taken.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.XLVIII-p183"></a>21. Christ Himself is a virgin; <a name="fr_1185"></a><a href="#fn_1185"><font size="1">1186</font></a>
  and His mother is also a virgin; yea, though she is His mother, she is a virgin still. For Jesus has entered in through the closed doors, <a name="fr_1186"></a><a href="#fn_1186"><font size="1">1187</font></a>
  and in His sepulchre—a new one hewn out of the hardest rock—no man is laid either before Him or after Him. <a name="fr_1187"></a><a href="#fn_1187"><font size="1">1188</font></a>
  Mary is “a garden enclosed…a fountain sealed,” <a name="fr_1188"></a><a href="#fn_1188"><font size="1">1189</font></a>
  and from that fountain flows, according to Joel, <a name="fr_1189"></a><a href="#fn_1189"><font size="1">1190</font></a>
  the river which waters the torrent bed either <a name="fr_1190"></a><a href="#fn_1190"><font size="1">1191</font></a>
  of cords or of thorns; <a name="fr_1191"></a><a href="#fn_1191"><font size="1">1192</font></a>
  of cords being those of the sins by which we were beforetime bound, <a name="fr_1192"></a><a href="#fn_1192"><font size="1">1193</font></a>
  the thorns those which choked the seed the goodman of the house had sown. <a name="fr_1193"></a><a href="#fn_1193"><font size="1">1194</font></a>
  She is the east gate, spoken of by the prophet Ezekiel, <a name="fr_1194"></a><a href="#fn_1194"><font size="1">1195</font></a>
  always shut and always shining, and either concealing or revealing the Holy of Holies; and through her “the Sun of Righteousness,” <a name="fr_1195"></a><a href="#fn_1195"><font size="1">1196</font></a>
  our “high priest after the order of Melchizedek,” <a name="fr_1196"></a><a href="#fn_1196"><font size="1">1197</font></a>
  goes in and out. Let my critics explain to me how Jesus can have entered in through closed doors when He allowed His hands and His side to be handled, and showed that He had bones and flesh, <a name="fr_1197"></a><a href="#fn_1197"><font size="1">1198</font></a>
  thus proving that His was a true body and no <a name="page_79"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 79</font></a> <a name="v.XLVIII-Page_79"></a>mere phantom of one, and I will explain how the holy Mary can be at once a mother and a virgin. A mother before she was wedded, she remained a virgin after bearing her son. Therefore, as I was going to say, the virgin Christ and the virgin Mary have dedicated in themselves the first fruits of virginity for both sexes. <a name="fr_1198"></a><a href="#fn_1198"><font size="1">1199</font></a>
  The apostles have either been virgins or, though married, have lived celibate lives. Those persons who are chosen to be bishops, priests, and deacons are either virgins or widowers; or at least when once they have received the priesthood, are vowed to perpetual chastity. Why do we delude ourselves and feel vexed if while we are continually straining after sexual indulgence, we find the palm of chastity denied to us? We wish to fare sumptuously, and to enjoy the embraces of our wives, yet at the same time we desire to reign with Christ among virgins and widows. Shall there be but one reward, then, for hunger and for excess, for filth and for finery, for sackcloth and for silk? Lazarus, <a name="fr_1199"></a><a href="#fn_1199"><font size="1">1200</font></a>
  in his lifetime, received evil things, and the rich man, clothed in purple, fat and sleek, while he lived enjoyed the good things of the flesh but, now that they are dead, they occupy different positions. Misery has given place to satisfaction, and satisfaction to misery. And it rests with us whether we will follow Lazarus or the rich man.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="v.XLVIII-p141"></a> That what is now known as reservation of the elements was practised in the early church there is abundant evidence to show. Justin Martyr (Apol. I. 65) writes: “The deacons communicate each of those present and carry away to the absent of the blest bread and wine and water.” And those to whom the eucharist was thus taken were not bound to consume it immediately, or all at once, but might reserve a part or all for future occasions. According to Basil (Ep. 93<a name="v.XLVIII-p141.1"></a>), “in Egypt the laity for the most part had every one the communion in their own houses”—and “all those who dwell alone in the desert, when there is no priest, keep the communion at home and receive it at their own hands.” So Jerome speaks (Letter CXXV. 20) of Exuperius as “carrying the Lords body in a wicker basket, His blood in a vessel of glass.” See the article “Reservation” in Smith and Cheethams Dict. of Christian Antiquities.</p>
