 </p><p class="c26"><a name="vii.ii.v-p1"></a>  <span class="c1"><a name="vii.ii.v-p1.1"></a>Preface to the Book of Hebrew Questions.</span></p>  
 <p class="c50"><a name="vii.ii.v-p2"></a>Written <span class="c17"><a name="vii.ii.v-p2.1"></a>a.d.</span> 388. For the scope and character of this work, see Prolegomena.</p>  
 <p class="c31"><a name="vii.ii.v-p3"></a>The object of the Preface to a book is to set forth the argument of the work which follows; but I am compelled to begin by answering what has been said against me. My case is somewhat like that of Terence, who turned the scenic prologues of his plays into a defence of himself. We have a <a name="fr_5376"></a><a href="#fn_5376"><font size="1">5377</font></a>
 Luscius Lanuvinus, like the one who worried him, and who brought charges against the poet as if he had been a plunderer of the treasury. The bard of Mantua suffered in the same way; he had translated a few verses of Homer very exactly, and they said that he was nothing but a plagiarist from the ancients. But he answered them that it was no small proof of strength to wrest the club of Hercules from his hands. Why, even Tully, who stands on the pinnacle of Roman eloquence, that king of orators and glory of the Latin tongue, has actions for embezzlement <a name="fr_5377"></a><a href="#fn_5377"><font size="1">5378</font></a>
  brought against him by the Greeks. I cannot, therefore, be surprised if a poor little fellow like me is exposed to the gruntings of vile swine who trample our pearls under their feet, when some of the most learned of men, men whose glory ought to have hushed the voice of ill will, have felt the flames of envy. It is true, this happened by a kind of justice to men whose eloquence had filled with its resonance the theatres and the senate, the public assembly and the rostra; hardihood always courts detraction, and (as Horace says):</p>  
 <p class="c40"><a name="vii.ii.v-p6"></a>“The <a name="fr_5378"></a><a href="#fn_5378"><font size="1">5379</font></a>
  highest peaks invoke</p>  
 <p class="c34"><a name="vii.ii.v-p8"></a>The lightnings stroke.”</p>  
 <p class="c27"><a name="vii.ii.v-p9"></a>But I am in a corner, remote from the city and the forum, and the wranglings of crowded courts; yet, even so (as Quintilian says) ill-will has sought me out. Therefore, I beseech the reader,</p>  
 <p class="c52"><a name="vii.ii.v-p10"></a>“If <a name="fr_5379"></a><a href="#fn_5379"><font size="1">5380</font></a>
  one there be, if one,</p>  
 <p class="c28"><a name="vii.ii.v-p12"></a>Who, rapt by strong desire, these lines shall read,”</p>  
 <p><a name="vii.ii.v-p13"></a>not to expect eloquence or oratorical grace in those Books of Hebrew Questions, which I propose to write on all the sacred books; but rather, that he should himself answer my detractors for me, and tell them that a work of a new kind can claim some indulgence. I am poor and of low estate; I neither possess riches nor do I think it right to accept them if they are offered me; and, similarly, let me tell them that it is impossible for them to have the riches of Christ, that is, the knowledge of the Scriptures, and the worlds riches as well. It will be my simple aim, therefore, first, to point out the mistakes of those who suspect some fault in the Hebrew Scriptures, and, secondly, to correct the faults, which evidently teem in the Greek and Latin copies, by a reference to the original authority; and, further, to explain the etymology of things, names, and countries, when it is not apparent from the sound of the Latin words, by giving a paraphrase in the vulgar tongue. To enable the student more easily to take note of these emendations, I propose, in the first place, to set out the true <a name="fr_5380"></a><a href="#fn_5380"><font size="1">5381</font></a>
  reading itself, as I am now able to do, and then, by bringing the later readings into comparison with it, to <a name="fr_5381"></a><a href="#fn_5381"><font size="1">5382</font></a>
 indicate what has been omitted or added or altered. It is not my purpose, as snarling ill-will pretends, to convict the LXX. of error, nor do I look upon my own labour as a disparagement of theirs. The fact is that they, since their work was undertaken for King Ptolemy of Alexandria, did not choose to bring to light all the mysteries which the sacred writings contain, and especially those which give the promise of the advent of Christ, for fear that he who held the Jews in esteem because they were believed to worship one God, would come to think that they worshipped a second. But we find that the Evangelists, and even our Lord and Saviour, and the Apostle Paul, also, bring forward many citations as coming from the Old Testament which are not contained in our copies; and on these I shall dilate more fully in their proper <a name="page_487"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 487</font></a> <a name="vii.ii.v-Page_487"></a>places. But it is clear from this fact that those are the best <span class="c17"><a name="vii.ii.v-p15.1"></a>mss.</span> which most correspond with the authoritative words of the New Testament. Add to this that Josephus, who gives the story of the Seventy Translators, reports them as translating only the five books of Moses; and we also acknowledge that these are more in harmony with the Hebrew than the rest. And, further, those who afterward came into the field as translators—I mean Aquila and Symmachus and Theodotion—give a version very different from that which we use. <a name="fr_5382"></a><a href="#fn_5382"><font size="1">5383</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="vii.ii.v-p17"></a>I have but one word more to say, and it may calm my detractors. Foreign goods are to be imported only to the regions where there is a demand for them. Country people are not obliged to buy balsam, pepper, and dates. As to Origen, I say nothing. His name (if I may compare small things with great) is even more than my own the object of ill-will, because, though following the common version in his Homilies, which were spoken to common people, yet, in his Tomes, <a name="fr_5383"></a><a href="#fn_5383"><font size="1">5384</font></a>
  that is, in his fuller discussion of Scripture, he yields to the Hebrew as the truth, and, though surrounded by his own forces, occasionally seeks the foreign tongue as his ally. I will only say this about him: that I should gladly have his knowledge of the Scriptures, even if accompanied with all the ill-will which clings to his name, and that I do not care a straw for these shades and spectral ghosts, whose nature is said to be to chatter in dark corners and be a terror to babies.</p>
