 <p class="c16"><a name="v.CV-p2"></a>Jeromes answer to the foregoing. He complains that even now he has not received Augustines letter and asks him to send him a copy of it. Popular rumour, he declares, credits Augustine with a deliberate suppression of the letter in order that he may seem to win an easy victory over his opponent. Jerome next deals with Augustines denial of having made a written attack upon him and concludes by refusing for the present all discussion of points of criticism. The date of the letter is 403 <span class="c17"><a name="v.CV-p2.1"></a>a.d.</span> See Augustine, vol. i., Letter LXXII.</p>
