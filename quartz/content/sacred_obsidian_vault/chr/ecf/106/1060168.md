 <p class="c22"><a name="vi.v.lxxii-p2"></a>139. Matthew goes on as follows: “And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard His parables, they perceived that He spake of them: and when they sought to lay hands on Him, they feared the multitude, because they took Him for a prophet. And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said, The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king which made a marriage for his son, and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the 				wedding, and they would not come;” and so on, down to the words, “For many are called, but few are chosen.” <a name="fr_1162"></a><a href="#fn_1162"><font size="1">1163</font></a>
  This parable concerning the guests who were invited to the wedding is related only by Matthew. Luke also records something which resembles it. But that is really a different passage, as the order itself sufficiently indicates, although there is some similarity between the two. <a name="fr_1163"></a><a href="#fn_1163"><font size="1">1164</font></a>
  The matters introduced, however, by Matthew immediately after the parable concerning the vineyard, and the killing of the son of the head of the house,—namely, the Jews perception that this whole discourse was directed against them, and their beginning to contrive treacherous schemes against Him,—are attested likewise by Mark and Luke, who also keep the same order in inserting them. <a name="fr_1164"></a><a href="#fn_1164"><font size="1">1165</font></a>
  But after this paragraph they proceed to another subject, and immediately subjoin a passage which Matthew has also indeed introduced in due order, but only subsequently to this parable of the marriage, which he alone has put on record here.</p>
