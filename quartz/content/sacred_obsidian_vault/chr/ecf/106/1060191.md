 </p><p class="c39"><a name="vi.vi.xiii-p1"></a> <span class="c2"><a name="vi.vi.xiii-p1.1"></a>Chapter XII.—Of the Concord Preserved Among All the Four Evangelists on the Subject of the Parting of His Raiment.</span></p>  			 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vi.vi.xiii-p2"></a>39. Matthew goes on thus: “And after they crucified Him, they parted His garments, casting lots: and sitting down, they watched Him.” <a name="fr_1380"></a><a href="#fn_1380"><font size="1">1381</font></a>
  Mark reports the same incident, as follows: “And crucifying Him, they parted His garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.” <a name="fr_1381"></a><a href="#fn_1381"><font size="1">1382</font></a>
  In like manner Luke says: “And they parted His raiment, and cast lots. And the people stood beholding.” <a name="fr_1382"></a><a href="#fn_1382"><font size="1">1383</font></a>
  The occurrence is thus recorded briefly by the first three. But John gives us a more detailed narrative of the method in which the act was gone about. His version runs thus: “Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took His garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also His coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout. They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that 				the Scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my garments, and for my vesture they did cast lots.” <a name="fr_1383"></a><a href="#fn_1383"><font size="1">1384</font></a>
