 </p><p class="c39"><a name="vi.iv.xxviii-p1"></a> <span class="c2"><a name="vi.iv.xxviii-p1.1"></a>Chapter XXVIII.—Of the Predicted Rejection of Idols.</span></p>  			 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vi.iv.xxviii-p2"></a>43. It cannot be questioned that what was predicted at sundry times by His prophets is now being realized,—namely, the announcement that He would disclaim His impious people (not, indeed, the people as a whole, because even of the Israelites many have believed in Christ; for His apostles themselves belonged to that nation), and would humble every proud and injurious person, so that He should Himself alone be exalted, that is to say, alone be manifested to men as lofty 				and mighty; until idols should be cast away by those who believe, and be concealed by those who believe not; when the earth is broken by His fear, that is to say, when the men of <a name="page_95"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 95</font></a> <a name="vi.iv.xxviii-Page_95"></a>earth are subdued by fear, to wit, by fearing His law, or the law of those who, being at once believers in His name and rulers among the nations, shall interdict such sacrilegious practices.</p>  			 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vi.iv.xxviii-p3"></a>44. For these things, which I have thus briefly stated in the way of introduction, and with a view to their readier apprehension, are thus expressed by the prophet: And now, O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the Lord. For He has disclaimed His people the house of Israel, because the country was replenished, as from the beginning, with their soothsayings as with those of strangers, and many strange children were born to them. For their 				country was replenished with silver and gold, neither was there any numbering of their treasures; their land also is full of horses, neither was there any numbering of their chariots: their land also is full of the abominations of the works of their own hands, and they have worshipped that which their own fingers have made. And the mean man <a name="fr_620"></a><a href="#fn_620"><font size="1">621</font></a>
  has bowed himself, and the great man <a name="fr_621"></a><a href="#fn_621"><font size="1">622</font></a>
  has humbled himself; and I will not forgive it them. And now enter ye into the rocks, and hide yourselves in the earth from before the fear of the Lord, and from the majesty of His power, when He arises to crush the earth: for the eyes of the Lord are lofty, and man is low; and the haughtiness of men shall be humbled, and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day. For the day of the Lord of Hosts shall be upon every one that is injurious and proud, and upon every one that 				is lifted up and humbled, <a name="fr_622"></a><a href="#fn_622"><font size="1">623</font></a>
  and they shall be brought low; and upon every cedar of Lebanon of the high ones and the lifted up, <a name="fr_623"></a><a href="#fn_623"><font size="1">624</font></a>
  and upon every tree of the Lebanon of Bashan, <a name="fr_624"></a><a href="#fn_624"><font size="1">625</font></a>
  and upon every mountain, and upon every high hill, <a name="fr_625"></a><a href="#fn_625"><font size="1">626</font></a>
  and upon every ship of the sea, and upon every spectacle of the beauty of ships. And the contumely of men shall be humbled and shall fall, and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day; <a name="fr_626"></a><a href="#fn_626"><font size="1">627</font></a>
  and all things made by hands they shall hide in dens, and in holes of the rocks, and in caves of the earth, from before the fear of the Lord, and from the majesty of His power, when He arises to crush the earth: for in that day a man shall cast away the abominations of gold and silver, the vain and evil things which they made for worship, in order to go into the clefts of the solid rock, and into the holes of the rocks, from before the fear of the Lord, and from the majesty 				of His power, when He arises to break the earth in pieces. <a name="fr_627"></a><a href="#fn_627"><font size="1">628</font></a>
