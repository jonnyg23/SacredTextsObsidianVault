 </p><p class="c39"><a name="vi.iv.x-p1"></a> <span class="c2"><a name="vi.iv.x-p1.1"></a>Chapter X.—Of Some Who are Mad Enough to Suppose that the Books Were Inscribed with the Names of Peter and Paul.</span></p>  			 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vi.iv.x-p2"></a>15. Nay more, as by divine judgment, some of those who either believe, or wish to have it believed, that Christ wrote matter of that description, have even wandered so far into error as to allege that these same books bore on their front, in the form of epistolary superscription, a designation addressed to Peter and Paul. And it is quite possible that either the enemies of the name of Christ, or certain parties who thought that they might impart to this kind of 				execrable arts the weight of authority drawn from so glorious a name, may have written things of that nature under the name of Christ and the apostles. But in such most deceitful audacity they have been so utterly blinded as simply to have made themselves fitting objects for laughter, even with young people who as yet know Christian literature only in boyish fashion, and rank merely in the grade of readers.</p>  			 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vi.iv.x-p3"></a>16. For when they made up their minds to represent Christ to have written in such strain as that to His disciples, they bethought themselves of those of His followers who might best be taken for the persons to whom Christ might most readily be believed to have written, as the individuals who had kept by Him on the most familiar terms of friendship. And so Peter and Paul occurred to them, I believe, just because in many places they chanced to see these two apostles 				represented in pictures as both in company with Him. <a name="fr_549"></a><a href="#fn_549"><font size="1">550</font></a>
  For Rome, in a specially honourable and solemn manner, <a name="fr_550"></a><a href="#fn_550"><font size="1">551</font></a>
  commends the merits of Peter and of Paul, for this reason among others, namely, that they suffered [martyrdom] on the same day. Thus to fall most completely into error was the due desert of men who sought for Christ and His apostles not in the holy writings, but on painted walls. Neither <a name="page_84"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 84</font></a> <a name="vi.iv.x-Page_84"></a>is it to be wondered at, that these fiction-limners were misled by the painters. <a name="fr_551"></a><a href="#fn_551"><font size="1">552</font></a>
  For throughout the whole period during which Christ lived in our mortal flesh in fellowship with His disciples, Paul had never become His disciple. Only after His passion, after His resurrection, after His ascension, after the mission of the Holy Spirit from heaven, after many Jews had been converted and had shown marvellous faith, after the stoning of Stephen the deacon and martyr, and when Paul still bore the name Saul, and was grievously persecuting those who had become 				believers in Christ, did Christ call that man [by a voice] from heaven, and made him His disciple and apostle. <a name="fr_552"></a><a href="#fn_552"><font size="1">553</font></a>
  How, then, is it possible that Christ could have written those books which they wish to have it believed that He did write before His death, and which were addressed to Peter and Paul, as those among His disciples who had been most intimate with Him, seeing that up to that date Paul had not yet become a disciple of His at all?</p>
