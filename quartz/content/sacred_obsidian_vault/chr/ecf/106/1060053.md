 <p class="c22"><a name="v.iii.xxiii-p2"></a>77. But because this belongs to few, He now begins to speak of searching for and possessing wisdom, which is a tree of life; and certainly, in searching for and possessing, <i> i.e.</i> contemplating this wisdom, such an eye is led through all that precedes to a point where there may now be seen the narrow way and the strait gate. When, therefore, He says in continuation, “Enter ye <a name="fr_456"></a><a href="#fn_456"><font size="1">457</font></a>
  in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which <a name="page_60"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 60</font></a> <a name="v.iii.xxiii-Page_60"></a>go in thereat: because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it; <a name="fr_457"></a><a href="#fn_457"><font size="1">458</font></a>
  He does not say so for this reason, that the Lords yoke is rough, or His burden heavy; but because few are willing to bring their labours to an end, giving too little credit to Him who cries, “Come unto me, all ye that labour, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: for my yoke is easy, <a name="fr_458"></a><a href="#fn_458"><font size="1">459</font></a>
  and my burden <a name="fr_459"></a><a href="#fn_459"><font size="1">460</font></a>
  is light” <a name="fr_460"></a><a href="#fn_460"><font size="1">461</font></a>
  (hence, moreover, the sermon before us took as its starting-point the lowly and meek in heart): and this easy yoke and light burden which many spurn, few submit to; and on that account the way becomes narrow which leadeth unto life, and the gate strait by which it is entered.</p>
