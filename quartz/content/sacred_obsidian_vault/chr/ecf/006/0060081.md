    <h2 align="CENTER"><a></a> TRANSLATOR'S BIOGRAPHICAL NOTICE.</h2>  
 <p>[a.d. 270.] Eusebius<sup><a href="footnote/fn30.htm">1</a></sup> speaks of Malchion as a man accomplished in other branches of learning<sup><a href="footnote/fn30.htm#P3098_797366">2</a></sup> and well-versed in Greek letters in particular, and as holding the presidency of the Sophists' school at Antioch. Jerome says that he taught rhetoric most successfully in the same city. Nor was it only that he excelled in secular erudition; but for the earnest sincerity of his Christian faith he obtained the dignity of presbyter in the church of that place, as Eusebius also tells us. He took part in the Synod of Antioch, which Eusebius calls the final council, and which Gallandi and others call the <i>second</i>, in opposition to Pearson, who holds that there was but one council at Antioch. This synod met apparently about a.d. 269, and dealt with Paul of Samosata, who had introduced the heresy of Artemon into the church of Antioch; and Eusebius says that Malchion was the only one who, in the discussion which took place there with the arch-heretic, and which was taken down by stenographers who were present, was able to detect the subtle and crafty sentiments of the man. Paul's real opinions being thus unveiled, after he had baffled the acuteness of his ecclesiastical judges for some time, he was at length convicted; and the discussion was published, and a synodical epistle was sent on the subject to Dionysius, bishop of Rome, and to Maximus of Alexandria, and to all the provinces, which, according to Jerome (<i>De vir. illustr</i>., ch. 71), was written by Malchion, and of which we have extracts in Eusebius. </p>
