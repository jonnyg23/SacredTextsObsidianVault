    <h2 align="CENTER"><a></a> Elucidations.</h2>  
 <p>I Can do no better than follow Dupin as to the authorship of these Homilies. He thinks the style of Proclus (of Constantinople) may be detected in them, though the fourth is beyond him for eloquence, and has even been thought worthy of St. Chrysostom. It was produced after Nicaea, and probably after Ephesus, its somewhat exaggerated praises of the qeoto/ko being unusual at an earlier period. The titles of these Homilies are the work of much later editors; and interpolations probably occur frequently, by the same hands. </p>
