 <sup>81 </sup>[The incomparable beauty of our English version of this twelfth chapter of <i>Koheleth</i> is heightened not a little by comparison with this turgid metaphrase, It fails, in almost every instance, to extract the kernel of the successive <font face="SPIonic">stixoi</font> of this superlatively poetic and didactic threnode. It must have been a youthful work.] </p>

 <sup>1 </sup>Of the holy Gregory, archbishop of Neo-Caesareia, surnamed Thaumaturgus, concerning those who, in the inroad of the barbarians, ate things sacrificed to idols, or offended in certain other matters. Gallandi, iii. p. 400. [Written A.D. 258 or 262.] There are scholia in Latin by Theodorus Balsamon and Joannes Zonaras on these canons. The note of the former on the last canon may be cited:-The present saint has defined shortly five several positions for the penitent; but he has not indicated either the times appointed for their exercise, or the sins for which discipline is determined. Basil the Great, again, has handed down to us an accurate account of these things in his canonical epistles. [Elucidation II.] Yet he, too, has referred to episcopal decision the matter of recovery through penalties [i.e., to the decision of his comprovincial bishops, as in Cyprian's example. See vol. v. p. 415, Elucidation XIII.; also Elucidation I. p. 20, <i>infra</i></p>
