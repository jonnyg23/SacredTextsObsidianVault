 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.ix.xxiv-p2"></a>Then Peter, so far as he could, and as time permitted, addressed the crowds on the faith of God, and the ordinances of religion; and then added, that if any one wished to know more accurately about these things, he should come to Antioch, “where,” said he, “we have resolved to stay three months, and to teach fully the things which pertain to salvation.  For if,” said he, “men leave their country and their parents for commercial or military purposes, and do not fear to undertake long voyages, why should it be thought burdensome or difficult to leave home for three months for the sake of eternal life?”  When he had said these things, and more to the same purpose, I presented a thousand drachmas to the woman who had entertained my mother, and who had recovered her health by means of Peter, and in the presence of all committed her to the charge of a certain good man, the chief person in that town, who promised that he would <a name="page_162"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 162</font></a> <a name="vi.iii.ix.xxiv-Page_162"></a>gladly do what we demanded of him.  I also distributed a little money among some others, and among those women who were said formerly to have comforted my mother in her miseries, to whom I also expressed my thanks.  And after this we sailed, along with my mother, to Antaradus.</p>
