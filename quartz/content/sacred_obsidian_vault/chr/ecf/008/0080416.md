 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.x.x-p2"></a>Then the old man said:  “You are following it out exceedingly well.”  Then Niceta:  “Now, then, we must inquire concerning the method of the world; of which the first inquiry is divided into two parts.  For it is asked whether it has been made or not?  And if it has not been made, itself must be that Unbegotten from which all things are.  But if it has been made, concerning this again the question is divided into two parts, whether it was made by itself, or by another.  And if indeed it was made by itself, then without doubt providence is excluded.  If providence is not admitted, in vain is the mind incited to virtue, in vain justice is maintained, if there be no one to render to the just man according to his merits.  But even the soul itself will not appear to be immortal, if there be no dispensation of providence to receive it after its escape from the body.</p>
