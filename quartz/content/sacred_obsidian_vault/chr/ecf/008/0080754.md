 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.vi.lxvii-p2"></a>“It is necessary, therefore, that the Church, as a city built upon a hill, have an order approved of God, and good government.  In particular, let the bishop, as chief, be heard in the things which he speaks; and let the elders give heed that the things ordered be done.  Let the deacons, going about, look after the bodies and the souls of the brethren, and report to the bishop.  Let all the rest of the brethren bear wrong patiently; but if they wish judgment to be given concerning wrongs done to them, let them be reconciled in presence of the elders; and let the elders report the reconciliation to the bishop.</p>
