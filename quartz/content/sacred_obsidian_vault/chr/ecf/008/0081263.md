 <p class="c21"><a name="vii.xii.xi-p2"></a>And Jesus went forth out of the prætorium, and the two malefactors with Him.  And when they came to the place, they stripped Him of his clothes, and girded Him with a towel, and put a crown of thorns on Him round His head.  And they crucified Him; and at the same time also they hung up the two malefactors along with Him.  And Jesus said:  Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.  And the soldiers parted His clothes among them; and the people stood looking at Him.  And the chief priests, and the rulers with them, mocked Him, saying:  He saved others; let him save himself.  If he be the Son of God, let him come down from the cross.  And the soldiers made sport of Him, coming near and offering Him vinegar mixed with gall, and said:  Thou art the king of the Jews; save thyself. <a name="fr_1834"></a><a href="#fn_1834"><font size="1">1835</font></a>
