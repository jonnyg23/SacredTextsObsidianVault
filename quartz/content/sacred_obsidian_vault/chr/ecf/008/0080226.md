 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.v.xvi-p2"></a>To this Simon answered:  “Was not He able to make us all such that we should be good, and that we should not have it in our power to be otherwise?”  Peter answered:  “This also is an absurd question.  For if He had made us of an unchangeable nature and incapable of being moved away from good, we should not be really good, because we could not be aught else; and it would not be of our purpose that we were good; and what we did would not be ours, but of the necessity of our nature. <a name="fr_683"></a><a href="#fn_683"><font size="1">684</font></a>
   But how can that be called good which is not done of purpose?  And on this account the world required long periods, until the number of souls which were predestined to fill it should be completed, and then that visible heaven should be folded up like a scroll, and that which is higher should appear, and the souls of the blessed, being restored to their bodies, should be ushered into light; but the souls of the wicked, for their impure actions being surrounded with fiery spirit, should be plunged into the abyss of unquenchable fire, to endure punishments through eternity.  Now that these things are so, the true Prophet. has testified to us; concerning whom, if you wish to know that He is a prophet, I shall instruct you by innumerable declarations.  For of those things which were spoken by Him, even now everything that He said is being fulfilled; and those things which He spoke with respect to the future are believed to be about to be fulfilled, for faith is given to the future from those things which have already come to pass.”</p>
