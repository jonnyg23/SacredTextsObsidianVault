 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iv.lv-p2"></a>Peter answered:  “O Simon, they are wont to conceive such absurdities against God who do not read the law with the instruction of masters, but account themselves teachers, and think that they can understand the law, though he has not explained it to them who has learned of the Master. <a name="fr_664"></a><a href="#fn_664"><font size="1">665</font></a>
   Nevertheless now, that we also may seem to follow the book of the law according to your apprehension of it; inasmuch as you say that the creator of the world is shown to be both impotent and evil, how is it that you do not see that that power of yours, which you say is superior to all, fails and lies under the very same charges?  For the very same thing may be said of it, that it is either powerless, since it does not correct those things which here are done amiss; or if it can and will not, it is evil; or if it neither can nor will, then it is both impotent and imperfect.  Whence that new power of yours is not only found liable to a similar charge, but even to a worse one, if, in addition to all these things, it is believed to be, when it is not.  For He who created the world, His existence is manifest by His very operation in creating the world, as you yourself also confess.  But this power which you say that you alone know, affords no indication of itself, by which we might perceive, at least, that it is, and subsists.”</p>
