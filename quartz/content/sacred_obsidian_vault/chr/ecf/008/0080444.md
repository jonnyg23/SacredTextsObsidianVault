 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.x.xxxviii-p2"></a>To these counsels of Peter we willingly assented, saying to him that we should do nothing but what was pleasing to him.  Then said he:  “That you may therefore be exercised without danger, each of you conduct the discussion in my presence, one succeeding another, and each one elucidating his own questions.  Now, then, as Niceta discoursed sufficiently yesterday, let Aquila conduct the discussion to-day; and after Aquila, Clement; and then I, if the case shall require it, will add something.”  Meantime, while we were talking in this way, we came to the house; and the master of the house welcomed us, and led us to a certain apartment, arranged after the manner of a theatre, and beautifully built.  There we found great crowds waiting for us, who had come during the night, and amongst them the old man who had argued with us yesterday.  Therefore we entered, having Peter in the midst of us, looking about if we could see the old man anywhere; and when Peter saw him hiding in the midst of the crowd, he called him to him, saying:  “Since you possess a soul more enlightened than most, why do you hide yourself, and conceal yourself in modesty?  Rather come hither, and propound your sentiments.”</p>
