 <p class="endnote"><a name="vi.iii.xi.xxi-p3"></a> This is a literal translation of text.  If we read <i>genesi</i> for <i>genesim</i>, we get:  “nor has Venus, etc., compelled them to keep up this custom in the midst of others through the force of <i>genesis.</i>”  Eusebius reads:  “And assuredly Venus, etc., is not found in the <i>genesis</i> of all of them.”</p>
