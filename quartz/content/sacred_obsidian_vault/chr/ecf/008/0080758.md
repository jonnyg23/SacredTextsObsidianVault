 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.vi.lxxi-p2"></a>“But, brethren, there are some things that you must not wait to hear, but must consider of yourselves what is reasonable.  Zacchæus alone having given himself up wholly to labour for you, and needing sustenance, and not being able to attend to his own affairs, how can he procure necessary support?  Is it not reasonable that you are to take forethought for his living? not waiting for his asking you, for this is the part of a beggar.  But he will rather die of hunger than submit to do this.  And shall not you incur punishment, not considering that the workman is worthy of his hire?  And let no one say:  Is, then, the word sold which was freely given?  Far be it.  For if any one has the means of living, and takes anything, he sells the word; but if he who has not takes support in order to live—as the Lord also took at supper and among His friends, having nothing, though He alone is the owner of all things—he sins not.  Therefore suitably honour elders, catechists, useful deacons, widows who have lived well, orphans as children of the Church.  But wherever there is need of any provision for an emergency, contribute all together.  Be kind one to another, not shrinking from the endurance of anything whatever for your own salvation.”</p>
