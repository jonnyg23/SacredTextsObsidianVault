 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.vi.lix-p2"></a>Peter, hearing this, on the following night assembled the multitude of hearers; and as soon as they were come together, he said:  “While I am going forth to the nations which say that there are many gods, to teach and to preach that God is one, who made heaven and earth, and all things that are in them, in order that they may love Him and be saved, evil has anticipated me, and by the very law of conjunction has sent Simon before me, in order that these men, if they shall cease to say that there are many gods, disowning those upon earth that are called gods, may think that there are many gods in heaven; so that, not feeling the excellency of the monarchy, they may perish with eternal punishment.  And what is most dreadful, since true doctrine has incomparable power, he forestalls me with slanders, and persuades them to this, not even at first to receive me; lest he who is the slanderer be convicted of being himself in reality a devil, and the true doctrine be received and believed.  Therefore I must quickly catch him up, lest the false accusation, through gaining time, wholly get hold of all men.</p>
