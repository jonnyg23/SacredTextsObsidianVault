 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.iii.xx-p2"></a>Whence I, my lord James, having promised as I was ordered, have not failed to write in books by chapters the greater part of his discourses in every city, which have been already written to you, and sent by himself, as for a token; and thus I despatched them to you, <a name="fr_898"></a><a href="#fn_898"><font size="1">899</font></a>
