 <p class="c21"><a name="x.v.xi-p4"></a>Melito to his brother Onesimus, greeting:—</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="x.v.xi-p5"></a>As you have often, prompted by your regard for the word <i>of God</i>, expressed a wish to have some extracts made from the Law and the Prophets concerning the Saviour, and concerning our faith in general, and have desired, moreover, to obtain an accurate account of the Ancient Books, as regards their number and their arrangement, I have striven to the best of my ability to perform this task:  well knowing your zeal for the faith, and your eagerness to become acquainted with the Word, and especially because <i>I am assured that</i>, through your yearning after God, you esteem these things beyond all things else, engaged as you are in a struggle for eternal salvation.</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="x.v.xi-p6"></a>I accordingly proceeded to the East, and went to the very spot where <i>the things in question</i> were preached and took place; and, having made myself accurately acquainted with the books of the Old Testament, I have set them down below, and herewith send you <i>the list</i>.  Their names are as follows:—</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="x.v.xi-p7"></a>The five <i>books</i> of Moses—Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy; Joshua, <a name="fr_3622"></a><a href="#fn_3622"><font size="1">3623</font></a>
  Judges, Ruth, the four <i>books</i> of Kings, the two of Chronicles, the <i>book of the</i> Psalms of David, the Proverbs of Solomon, also called <i>the Book of</i> Wisdom, Ecclesiastes, the Song of Songs, Job, <i>the books of</i> the prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, of the twelve contained in a single book, Daniel, Ezekiel, Esdras.  From these I have made my extracts, dividing them into six books.</p>
