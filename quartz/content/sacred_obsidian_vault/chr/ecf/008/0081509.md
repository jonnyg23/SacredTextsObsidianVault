 <p class="c35"><a name="x.v.xii-p2"></a><span class="c1"><a name="x.v.xii-p2.1"></a>From the Catena on Genesis. <a name="fr_3623"></a><a href="#fn_3623"><font size="1">3624</font></a>
 </span></p> 
 <p class="c21"><a name="x.v.xii-p4"></a>In place of Isaac the just, a ram appeared for slaughter, in order that Isaac might be liberated from <i>his</i> bonds.  The slaughter of this <i>animal</i> redeemed Isaac <i>from death</i>.  In like manner, the Lord, being slain, saved us; being bound, He loosed us; being sacrificed, He redeemed us…</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="x.v.xii-p5"></a>For the Lord was a lamb, like the ram which Abraham saw caught in the bush Sabec. <a name="fr_3624"></a><a href="#fn_3624"><font size="1">3625</font></a>
   But this bush represented the cross, and that place Jerusalem, and the lamb the Lord bound for slaughter.</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="x.v.xii-p7"></a>For as a ram was He bound, says he concerning our Lord Jesus Christ, and as a lamb was He shorn, and as a sheep was He led to the slaughter, and as a lamb was He crucified; and He carried the cross <a name="fr_3625"></a><a href="#fn_3625"><font size="1">3626</font></a>
  on His shoulders when He was led up <i>to the hill</i> to be slain, as was Isaac by his father.  But Christ suffered, and Isaac did not suffer:  for he was <i>but</i> a type of Him who should suffer.  Yet, even when serving <i>only</i> for a type of Christ, he smote men with astonishment and fear.</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="x.v.xii-p9"></a>For a new mystery was presented to view,—a son led by his father to a mountain to be slain, whose feet he bound together, and laid him on the wood of the sacrifice, preparing with care <a name="fr_3626"></a><a href="#fn_3626"><font size="1">3627</font></a>
  whatever was necessary to his immolation.  Isaac on his part is silent, bound like a ram, not opening his mouth, nor uttering a sound with his voice.  For, not fearing the knife, nor quailing before the fire, nor troubled by <i>the prospect of</i> suffering, he sustained bravely <i>the character of</i> the type of the Lord.  Accordingly there lies <a name="page_760"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 760</font></a> <a name="x.v.xii-Page_760"></a>Isaac before us, with his feet bound like a ram, his father standing by, with the knife all bare in his hand, not shrinking from shedding the blood of his son.</p>
