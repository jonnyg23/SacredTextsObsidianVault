 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xvi.xiii-p2"></a>That same evening we all enjoyed the benefit of Peters instruction.  Taking occasion by what had happened to our mother, he showed us how the results of chastity are good, while those of adultery are disastrous, and naturally bring destruction on the whole race, if not speedily, at all events slowly. <a name="fr_1175"></a><a href="#fn_1175"><font size="1">1176</font></a>
   “And to such an extent,” he says, “do deeds of chastity please God, that in this life He bestows some small favour on account of it, even on those who are in error; for salvation in the other world is granted only to those who have been baptized on account of their trust <a name="fr_1176"></a><a href="#fn_1176"><font size="1">1177</font></a>
  in Him, and who act chastely and righteously.  This ye yourselves have seen in the case of your mother, that the results of chastity are in the end good.  For perhaps she would have been cut off if she had committed adultery; but God took pity on her for having behaved chastely, rescued her from the death that threatened her, and restored to her her lost children.</p>
