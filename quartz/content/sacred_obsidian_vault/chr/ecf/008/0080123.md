 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iii.lxi-p2"></a>“Then Caiaphas attempted to impugn the doctrine of Jesus, saying that He spoke vain things, for He said that the poor are blessed; <a name="fr_590"></a><a href="#fn_590"><font size="1">591</font></a>
  and promised earthly rewards; and placed the chief gift in an earthly inheritance; and promised that those who maintain righteousness shall be satisfied with meat and drink; and many things of this sort He is charged with teaching.  Thomas, in reply, proves that his accusation is frivolous; showing that the prophets, in whom Caiaphas believes, taught these things much more, and did not show in what manner these things are to be, or how they are to be understood; whereas Jesus pointed out how they are to be taken.  And when he had spoken these things, and others of like kind, Thomas also held his peace.”</p>
