 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.xii.xxxv-p2"></a>When Niceta had thus spoken, Aquila answered: <a name="fr_873"></a><a href="#fn_873"><font size="1">874</font></a>
   “Whoever he was that was the author and inventor of these things, he seems to me to have been very impious, since he covered over those things which seem to be pleasant and seemly, and made the ritual of his superstition to consist in base and shameful observances, since those things which are written according to the letter are manifestly unseemly and base; and the whole observance of their religion consists in these, that by such crimes and impieties they may teach men to imitate their gods whom <a name="page_202"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 202</font></a> <a name="vi.iii.xii.xxxv-Page_202"></a>they worship.  For in these allegories what profit can there be to them?  For although they are framed so as to be decent, yet no use is derived from them for worship, nor for amendment of morals.</p>
