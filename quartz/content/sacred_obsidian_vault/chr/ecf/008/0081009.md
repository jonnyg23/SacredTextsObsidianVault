 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xvi.iv-p2"></a>As soon as my mother had enough of sleep, she awoke, and Peter at once began first to talk to her of <i>true</i> piety, saying:  “I wish you to know, O woman, the course of life involved in our religion. <a name="fr_1161"></a><a href="#fn_1161"><font size="1">1162</font></a>
   We worship one God, who made the world which you see; and we keep His law, which has for its chief injunctions to worship Him alone, and to hallow His name, and to honour our parents, and to be chaste, and to live piously.  In addition to this, we do not live with all indiscriminately; nor do we take our food from the same table as Gentiles, inasmuch as we cannot eat along with them, because they live impurely.  But when we have persuaded them to have true thoughts, and to follow a right course of action, and have baptized them with a thrice blessed invocation, then we dwell with them.  For not even if it were our father, or mother, or wife, or child, or brother, or <a name="page_301"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 301</font></a> <a name="vi.iv.xvi.iv-Page_301"></a>any other one having a claim by nature on our affection, can we venture to take our meals with him; for our religion compels us to make a distinction.  Do not, therefore, regard it as an insult if your son does not take his food along with you, until you come to have the same opinions and adopt the same course of conduct as he follows.”</p>
