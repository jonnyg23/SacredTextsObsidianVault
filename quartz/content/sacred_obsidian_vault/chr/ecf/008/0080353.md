 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.viii.ii-p2"></a>When he had said this, as very many had already assembled in the accustomed place of the garden to hear him, Peter went forth; and having saluted the crowds in his usual manner, began to speak as follows: <a name="fr_775"></a><a href="#fn_775"><font size="1">776</font></a>
   “Since, indeed, as land neglected by the cultivator necessarily produces thorns and thistles, so your sense, by long neglect, has produced a plentiful crop of noxious opinions of things and dogmas of false science; there is need now of much care in cultivating the field of your mind, that the word of truth, which is the true and diligent husbandman of the heart, may cultivate it with continual instructions.  It is therefore your part to render obedience to it, and to lop off superfluous occupations and anxieties, lest a noxious growth choke the good seed of the word.  For it may be that a short and earnest diligence may repair a long times neglect; for the time of every ones life is uncertain, and therefore we must hasten to salvation, lest haply sudden death seize upon him who delays.</p>
