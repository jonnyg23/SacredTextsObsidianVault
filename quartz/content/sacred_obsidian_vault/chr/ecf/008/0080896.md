 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xii.xiii-p2"></a>“But some of the maleficent demons deceive in another way.  For at first they do not even show their existence, in order that care may not be taken against them; but in due time, by means of anger, love, or some other affection, they suddenly injure the body, by sword, or halter, or precipice, or something else, and at last bring to punishment the deceived souls of those who have been mixed up with them, as we said, withdrawing into the purifying fire.  But others, who are deceived in another way, do not approach us, being seduced by the instigations of maleficent demons, as if they suffered these things at the hands of the gods themselves, on account of their neglect of them, and were able to reconcile them by sacrifices, and that it is not needful to come to us, but rather to flee from and hate us.  And at the same time <a name="fr_1114"></a><a href="#fn_1114"><font size="1">1115</font></a>
  they hate and flee from those who have greater compassion for them, and who follow after them in order to do good to them.</p>
