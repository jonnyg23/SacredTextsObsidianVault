 <p class="c21"><a name="vii.x.x-p2"></a>In the time of sowing, Joseph went out to sow wheat, and Jesus followed him.  And when Joseph began to sow, Jesus stretched out His hand, and took as much wheat as He could hold in His fist, and scattered it.  Joseph therefore came at reaping-time to reap his harvest.  Jesus came also, and collected the ears which He had scattered, and they made a hundred pecks <a name="fr_1768"></a><a href="#fn_1768"><font size="1">1769</font></a>
  of the best grain; and he called the poor, and the widows, and the orphans, and distributed to them the wheat which He had made.  Joseph also took a little of the same wheat, for the blessing of Jesus to his house.</p>
