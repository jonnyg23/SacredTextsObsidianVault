 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xvi.xvii-p2"></a>“Foolish, therefore, is every husband who separates his wife from the fear of God; for she who does not fear God is not afraid of her husband.  If she fear not God, who sees what is invisible, how will she be chaste in her unseen choice? <a name="fr_1182"></a><a href="#fn_1182"><font size="1">1183</font></a>
   And how will she be chaste, who does not come to the assembly to hear chaste-making words?  And how could she obtain admonition?  And how will she be chaste without watchmen, <a name="page_304"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 304</font></a> <a name="vi.iv.xvi.xvii-Page_304"></a>if she be not informed in regard to the coming judgement of God, and if she be not fully assured that eternal punishment is the penalty for the slight pleasure?  Wherefore, on the other hand, compel her even against her will always to come to hear the chaste-making word, yea, coax her to do so.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="vi.iv.xvi.xvii-p3"></a> “In her unseen choice” means, in what course of conduct she really prefers in her heart.  This reading occurs in one <span class="c9"><a name="vi.iv.xvi.xvii-p3.1"></a>ms.</span>; in the other <span class="c9"><a name="vi.iv.xvi.xvii-p3.2"></a>ms.</span> it is corrupt.  Schwegler amended it into, How shall she be chaste towards him who does not see <i>what is invisible</i>?” and the emendation is adopted by Dressel.</p>
