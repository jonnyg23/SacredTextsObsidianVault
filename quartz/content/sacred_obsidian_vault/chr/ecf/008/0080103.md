 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iii.xli-p2"></a>“But some one perhaps may say that it is possible for any one to imitate a number; but what shall we say of the signs and miracles which He wrought?  For Moses had wrought miracles and cures in Egypt.  He also of whom he foretold that He should rise up a prophet like unto himself, though He cured every sickness and infirmity among the people, wrought innumerable miracles, and preached eternal life, was hurried by wicked men to the cross; which deed was, however, by His power turned to good.  In short, while He was suffering, all the world suffered with Him; for the sun was darkened, the mountains were torn asunder, the graves were opened, the veil of the temple was rent, <a name="fr_568"></a><a href="#fn_568"><font size="1">569</font></a>
  as in lamentation for the destruction impending over the place.  And yet, though all the world was moved, they themselves are not even now moved to the consideration of these so great things.”</p>
