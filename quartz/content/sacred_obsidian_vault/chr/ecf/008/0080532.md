 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.xii.xxiv-p2"></a>“But also the sepulchres of his sons, who are regarded amongst these <i>the Gentiles</i> as gods, are openly pointed out, one in one place, and another in another:  that of Mercury at Hermopolis; that of the Cyprian Venus at Cyprus; that of Mars in Thrace; that of Bacchus at Thebes, where he is said to have been torn in pieces; that of Hercules at Tyre, where he was burnt with fire; that of Æsculapius in Epidaurus.  And all these are spoken of, not only as men who have died, but as wicked men who have been punished for their crimes; and yet they are adored as gods by foolish men. <a name="fr_865"></a><a href="#fn_865"><font size="1">866</font></a>
