 <p class="c21"><a name="vii.x.iii-p2"></a>And, lo, the angel of the Lord met Mary, and said to her:  Take up the boy, and return into the land of the Jews, for they who sought His life are dead.  And Mary rose up with Jesus; and they proceeded into the city of Nazareth, which is among the possessions of her father.  And when Joseph went out of Egypt after the death of Herod, he kept Him in the desert until there should be quietness in Jerusalem on the part of those who were seeking the boys life.  And he gave thanks to God because He had given him understanding, and because he had found favour in the presence of the Lord God.  Amen.</p>
