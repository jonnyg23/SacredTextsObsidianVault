 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xvi.ii-p2"></a>On my saying this, Peter gave them a summary account <a name="fr_1159"></a><a href="#fn_1159"><font size="1">1160</font></a>
  of all the incidents,—how, when they had gone on before, I Clement had explained to him my descent, the journey undertaken by my mother with her twin children on the false pretext of the dream; and furthermore, the journey undertaken by my father in search of her; and then how Peter himself, after hearing this, went into the island, met with the woman, saw her begging, and asked the reason of her so doing; and then ascertained who she was, and her mode of life, and the feigned dream, and the names of her children—that is, the name borne by me, who was left with my father, and the names of the twin children who travelled along with her, and who, she supposed, had perished in the deep.</p>
