 <p class="c22"><a name="viii.iii.ii.i-p4"></a>So great trust have we received from the Lord, the Founder of this holy seat and of the apostolic church, and from the blessed Peter, chief of the apostles, that we may labour with unwearied affection <a name="fr_2704"></a><a href="#fn_2704"><font size="1">2705</font></a>
  for the universal Church which has been redeemed by the blood of Christ, and aid all who serve the Lord, and give help to all who live piously by apostolic authority.  All who will live <a name="fr_2705"></a><a href="#fn_2705"><font size="1">2706</font></a>
  piously in Christ must needs endure reproaches from the impious and aliens, and be despised as fools and madmen, that they may be made better and purer who lose the good things of time that they may gain those of eternity.  But the contempt and ridicule of those who afflict and scorn them will be cast back upon themselves, when their abundance shall change to want, and their pride to confusion.</p>
