 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.vi.xx-p2"></a>“But give heed to my first discourse of the truth.  If any one do not allow the man fashioned by the hands of God to have had the Holy Spirit of Christ, how is he not guilty of the greatest impiety in allowing another born of an impure stock to have it?  But he would act most piously, if he should not allow to another to have it, but should say that he alone has it, who has changed his forms and his names from the beginning of the world, and so reappeared again and again in the world, until coming upon his own times, and being anointed with mercy for the works of God, he shall enjoy rest for ever.  His honour it is to bear rule and lordship over all things, in air, earth, and waters.  But in addition to these, himself having made man, he had breath, the indescribable garment of the soul, that he might be able to be immortal.</p>
