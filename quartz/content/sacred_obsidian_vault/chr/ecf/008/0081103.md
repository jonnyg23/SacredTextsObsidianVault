 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xxi.viii-p2"></a>And Peter said:  “Since, at least in appearance, you have confessed that you do not understand it, reply to the question I put to you, and you will learn the meaning of the statement.  Tell me, do you maintain that the Son, whoever he be, is just, or that he is not just?”  And Simon said:  “I maintain that he is most just.”  And Peter said:  “Seeing He is just, why does He not make the revelation to all, but only to those to whom He wishes?”  And Simon said:  “Because, being just, he wishes to make the revelation only to the worthy.”  And Peter said:  “Must He not therefore know the mind of each one, in order that He may make the revelation to the worthy?”  And Simon said:  “Of course he must.”  And Peter said:  “With reason, therefore, has the work of giving the revelation been confined to Him alone, for He alone knows the mind of every one; and it has not been given to you, who are not able to understand even that which is stated by us.”</p>
