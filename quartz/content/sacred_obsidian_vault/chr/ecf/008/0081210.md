 <p class="c21"><a name="vii.v.xxxiii-p2"></a>After these things, Joseph and Mary departed thence with Jesus into the city of Nazareth; and He remained there with His parents.  And on the first of the week, when Jesus was playing with the children on the roof of a certain house, it happened that one of the children pushed another down from the roof to the ground, and he was killed.  And the parents of the dead boy, who had not seen this, cried out against Joseph and Mary, saying:  Your son has thrown our son down to the ground, and he is dead.  But Jesus was silent, and answered them nothing.  And Joseph and Mary came in haste to Jesus; and His mother asked Him, saying:  My lord, tell me if thou didst throw him down.  And immediately Jesus went down from the roof to the ground, and called the boy by his name, Zeno.  And he answered Him:  My lord.  And Jesus said to him:  Was it I that threw thee down from the roof to the ground?  And he said:  No, my lord.  And the parents of the boy who had been dead wondered, and honoured Jesus for the miracle that had been wrought.  And Joseph and Mary departed thence with Jesus to Jericho.</p>
