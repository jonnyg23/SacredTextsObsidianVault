 <p class="c21"><a name="vii.xxv.ii-p2"></a><span class="c9"><a name="vii.xxv.ii-p2.1"></a>And</span> as Paul was being led away to be beheaded at a place about three miles from the city, he was in irons.  And there were three soldiers guarding him who were of a great family.  And when they had gone out of the gate about the length of a bow-shot, there met them a God-fearing woman; and she, seeing Paul dragged along in irons, had compassion on him, and wept bitterly.  And the name of the woman was called Perpetua; and she was one-eyed.  And Paul, seeing her weeping, says to her:  Give me thy handkerchief, and when I turn back I shall give it to thee.  And she, having taken the handkerchief, gave it to him willingly.  And the soldiers laughed, and said to the woman:  Why dost thou wish, woman, to lose thy handkerchief?  Knowest thou not that he is going away to be beheaded?  And Perpetua said to them:  I adjure you by the health of Cæsar to bind his eyes with this handkerchief when you cut off his head.  Which also was done.  And they beheaded him at the place called Aquæ Salviæ, near the pine tree. And as God had willed, before the soldiers came back, the handkerchief, having on it drops of blood, was restored to the woman.  And as she was carrying it, straightway and immediately her eye was opened.</p>

  gate.  And Potentiana also underwent many torments; and at last, having made a furnace one day, they burned her.</p>
