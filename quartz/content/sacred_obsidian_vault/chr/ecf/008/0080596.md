 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.iii.vii-p2"></a>“And with respect to the presbyters, take these <i>instructions</i>.  Above all things, let them join the young betimes in marriage, anticipating the entanglements of youthful lusts.  But neither let them neglect the marriage of those who are already old; for lust is vigorous even in some old men.  Lest, therefore, fornication find a place among you, and bring upon you a very pestilence, take precaution, and search, lest at any time the fire of adultery be secretly kindled among you.  For adultery is a very terrible thing, even such that it holds the second place in respect of punishment, the first being assigned to those who are in error, even although they be chaste.  Wherefore do you, as elders of the Church, exercise the spouse of Christ to chastity (by the spouse I mean the body of the Church); for if she be apprehended to be chaste by her royal Bridegroom, she shall obtain the greatest honour; and you, as wedding guests, shall receive great commendation.  But if she be caught having sinned, she herself indeed shall be cast out; and you shall suffer punishment, if at any time her sin has been through your negligence.</p>
