 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xv.xii-p2"></a>When Peter had spoken thus, a certain one amongst us ventured to invite him, in the name of all, that next day, early in the morning, he should sail to Aradus, an island opposite, distant, I suppose, not quite thirty stadia, for the purpose of seeing two pillars of vine-wood that were there, and that were of very great girth.  Therefore the indulgent Peter consented, saying, “When you leave the boat, do not go many of you together to see the things that you desire to see; for I do not wish that the attention of the inhabitants should be turned to you.”  And so we sailed, and in short time arrived at the island.  Then landing from the boat, we went to the place where the vine-wood pillars were, and along with them we looked at several of the works of Phidias.</p>
