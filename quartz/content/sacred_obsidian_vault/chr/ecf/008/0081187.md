 <p class="c21"><a name="vii.v.x-p2"></a>And on the second day, while Mary was at the fountain to fill her pitcher, the angel of the Lord appeared to her, saying:  Blessed art thou, Mary; for in thy womb thou hast prepared an habitation for the Lord.  For, lo, the light from heaven shall come and dwell in thee, and by means of thee will shine over the whole world.</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vii.v.x-p3"></a>Again, on the third day, while she was working at the purple with her fingers, there entered a young man of ineffable beauty.  And when Mary saw him, she exceedingly feared and trembled.  And he said to her:  Hail, Mary, full of grace; the Lord is with thee:  blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb. <a name="fr_1637"></a><a href="#fn_1637"><font size="1">1638</font></a>
   And when she heard these words, she trembled, and was exceedingly afraid.  Then the angel of the Lord added:  Fear not, Mary; for thou hast found favour with God:  Behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and shalt bring forth a King, who fills not only the earth, but the heaven, and who reigns from generation to generation.</p>
