 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iv.xiv-p2"></a>“At those sayings of his Simon grew pale; but after a little, recollecting himself, he thus answered:  Do not think that I am a man of your race.  I am neither magician, nor lover <a name="page_101"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 101</font></a> <a name="vi.iii.iv.xiv-Page_101"></a>of Luna, nor son of Antonius.  For before my mother Rachel and he came together, she, still a virgin, conceived me, while it was in my power to be either small or great, and to appear as a man among men. <a name="fr_609"></a><a href="#fn_609"><font size="1">610</font></a>
   Therefore I have chosen you first as my friends, for the purpose of trying you, that I may place you first in my heavenly and unspeakable places when I shall have proved you.  Therefore I have pretended to be a man, that I might more clearly ascertain if you cherish entire affection towards me.  But when I heard that, judging him indeed to be a wretch, yet wondering at his impudence; and blushing for him, and at the same time fearing lest he should attempt some evil against us, I beckoned to Niceta to feign for a little along with me, and said to him:  Be not angry with us, corruptible men, O thou incorruptible God, but rather accept our affection, and our mind willing to know who God is; for we did not till now know who thou art, nor did we perceive that thou art he whom we were seeking.”</p>
