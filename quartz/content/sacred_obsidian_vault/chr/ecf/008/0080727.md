 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.vi.xl-p2"></a>In like manner Simon, by taking many passages from the Scriptures, seemed to show that God is subject to every infirmity.  And to this Peter said:  “Does he who is evil, and wholly wicked, love to accuse himself in the things in which he sins?  Answer me this.”  Then said Simon:  “He does not.”  Then said Peter:  “How, then, can God be evil and wicked, seeing that those evil things which have been commonly written regarding Him, have been added by His own will!”  Then said Simon:  “It may be that the charge against Him is written by another power, and not according to His choice.”  Then said Peter:  “Let us then, in the first place, inquire into this.  If, indeed, He has of His own will accused Himself, as you formerly acknowledged, then He is not wicked; but if it is done by another power, it must be inquired and investigated with all energy who hath subjected to all evils Him who alone is good.”</p>
