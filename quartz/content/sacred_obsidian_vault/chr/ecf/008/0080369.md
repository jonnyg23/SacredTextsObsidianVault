 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.ix.ii-p2"></a>“But I know that you think it sad to be separated from me for the space of at least two days.  Believe me, that in whatever degree you love me, my affection towards you is tenfold greater.  But if, by reason of our mutual affection, we will not do the things that are right and honourable, such love will appear to be unreasonable.  And therefore, without bating a little of our love, let us attend to those things which seem useful and necessary; especially since not a day can pass in which you may not be present at my discussions.  For I purpose to pass through the most noted cities of the provinces one by one, as you also know, and to reside three months in each for the sake of teaching.  Now, therefore, go before me to Laodicea, which is the nearest city, and I shall follow you after two or three days, so far as I purpose.  But you shall wait for me at the inn nearest to the gate of the city; and thence again, when we have spent a few days there, you shall go before me to more distant cities.  And this I wish you to do at every city, for the sake of avoiding envy as much as in us lies, and also that the brethren who are with us, finding lodgings prepared in the several cities by your foresight, may not seem to be vagabonds.”</p>
