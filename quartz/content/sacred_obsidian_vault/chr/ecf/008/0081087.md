 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xx.xiii-p2"></a>Simon, on hearing this, interrupted him, and said:  “I know against whom you are making these remarks; but in order that I may not spend any time in discussing subjects which I do not wish to discuss, repeating the same statements to refute you, reply to that which is concisely stated by us.  You professed that you had well understood the doctrines and deeds <a name="fr_1345"></a><a href="#fn_1345"><font size="1">1346</font></a>
  of your teacher because you saw them before you with your own eyes, <a name="fr_1346"></a><a href="#fn_1346"><font size="1">1347</font></a>
  and heard them with your <a name="page_322"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 322</font></a> <a name="vi.iv.xx.xiii-Page_322"></a>own ears, and that it is not possible for any other to have anything similar by vision or apparition.  But I shall show that this is false.  He who hears any one with his own ears, is not altogether fully assured of the truth of what is said; for his mind has to consider whether he is wrong or not, inasmuch as he is a man as far as appearance goes.  But apparition not merely presents an object to view, but inspires him who sees it with confidence, for it comes from God.  Now reply first to this.” <a name="fr_1347"></a><a href="#fn_1347"><font size="1">1348</font></a>
