 <p class="c21"><a name="vii.xii.xii-p2"></a>And it was about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over the earth until the ninth hour, the sun being darkened; and the <a name="page_421"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 421</font></a> <a name="vii.xii.xii-Page_421"></a>curtain of the temple was split in the middle.  And crying out with a loud voice, Jesus said:  Father, <span class="c9"><a name="vii.xii.xii-p2.1"></a>Baddach</span> <span class="c9"><a name="vii.xii.xii-p2.2"></a>ephkid</span> <span class="c9"><a name="vii.xii.xii-p2.3"></a>ruel</span>, which is, interpreted:  Into Thy hands I commit my spirit. <a name="fr_1836"></a><a href="#fn_1836"><font size="1">1837</font></a>
   And having said this, He gave up the ghost.  And the centurion, seeing what had happened, glorified God, and said:  This was a just man.  And all the crowds that were present at this spectacle, when they saw what had happened, beat their breasts and went away.</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vii.xii.xii-p4"></a>And the centurion reported what had happened to the procurator.  And when the procurator and his wife heard it, they were exceedingly grieved, and neither ate nor drank that day.  And Pilate sent for the Jews, and said to them:  Have you seen what has happened?  And they say:  There has been an eclipse of the sun in the usual way. <a name="fr_1837"></a><a href="#fn_1837"><font size="1">1838</font></a>
 </p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vii.xii.xii-p6"></a>And His acquaintances were standing at a distance, and the women who came with Him from Galilee, seeing these things.  And a man named Joseph, a councillor from the city of Arimathæa, who also waited for the kingdom of God, went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.  And he took it down, and wrapped it in clean linen, and placed it in a tomb hewn out of the rock, in which no one had ever lain.</p>
