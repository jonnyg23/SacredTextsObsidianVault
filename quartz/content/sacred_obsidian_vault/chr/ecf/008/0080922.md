 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xiii.xv-p2"></a>“For if you say that, after the manner of Cæsar, God has subordinate powers—those, namely, which are called gods—you do not thus go by your illustration.  For if you went by it, you must of necessity know that it is not lawful to give the name of Cæsar to another, whether he be consul, or prefect, or captain, or any one else, and that he who gives such a name shall not live, and he who takes it shall be cut off.  Thus, according to your own illustration, the name of God must not be given to another; and he who is tempted either to take or give it is destroyed.  Now, if this insult of a man induces punishment, much more they who call others gods shall be subject to eternal punishment, as insulting God.  And with good reason; because you subject to all the insult that you can the name which it was committed to you to honour, in order to His monarchy.  For <span class="c9"><a name="vi.iv.xiii.xv-p2.1"></a>God</span> is not properly His name; but you having in the meantime received it, insult what has been given you, that it may be accounted as done against the real name, according as you use that.  But you subject it to every kind of insult.</p>
