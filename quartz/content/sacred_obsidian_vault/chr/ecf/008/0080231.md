 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.v.xxi-p2"></a>But on the following day, Peter, as usual, rising before dawn, found us already awake and ready to listen; and thus began:  “I entreat you, my brethren and fellow-servants, that if any of you is not able to wake, he should not torment himself through respect to my presence, because sudden change is difficult; but if for a long time one gradually accustoms himself, that will not be distressing which comes of use.  For we had not all the same training; although in course of time we shall be able to be moulded into one habit, for they say that custom holds the place of a second nature.  But I call God to witness that I am not offended, if any one is not able to wake; but rather by this, if, when any one sleeps all through the night, he does not in the course of the day fulfil that which he omitted in the night.  For it is necessary to give heed intently and unceasingly, to the study of doctrine, that our mind may be filled with the thought of God only:  because in the mind which is filled with the thought of God, no place will be given to the wicked one.”</p>
