 <p class="c21"><a name="vii.v.xi-p2"></a>While these things were doing, Joseph was occupied with his work, house-building, in the districts by the sea-shore; for he was a carpenter.  And after nine months he came back to his house, and found Mary pregnant.  Wherefore, being in the utmost distress, he trembled and cried out, saying:  O Lord God, receive my spirit; for it is better for me to die than to live any longer.  And the virgins who were with Mary said to him:  Joseph, what art thou saying?  We know that no man has touched her; we can testify that she is still a virgin, and untouched.  We have watched over her; always has she continued with us in prayer; daily do the angels of God speak with her; daily does she receive food from the hand of the Lord.  We know not how it is possible that there can be any sin in her.  But if thou wishest us to tell thee what we suspect, nobody but the angel of the Lord <a name="fr_1638"></a><a href="#fn_1638"><font size="1">1639</font></a>
  has made her pregnant.  Then said Joseph:  Why do you mislead me, to believe that an angel of the Lord has made her pregnant?  But it is possible that some one has pretended to be an angel of the Lord, and has beguiled her.  And thus speaking, he wept, and said:  With what face shall I look at the temple of the Lord, or with what face shall I see the priests of God?  What am I to do?  And thus saying, he thought that he would flee, and send her away.</p>
