 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xxi.vii-p2"></a>And Simon said:  “I confess I have not understood what you mean by the expression, You would do as they do who know.”  And Peter said:  “If you have not understood it, then you cannot know the mind of every one; and if you are ignorant of this, then you do not know those who are worthy of the revelation.  You are not the Son, for <a name="fr_1377"></a><a href="#fn_1377"><font size="1">1378</font></a>
  the Son knows.  Wherefore He reveals <i>Him</i> to whomsoever He wishes, because they are worthy.”  And Simon said:  “Be not deceived.  I know those who are worthy, and I am not the Son.  And yet I have not understood what meaning you attach to the words, He reveals <i>Him</i> to whomsoever He wishes.  But I said that I did not understand it, not because I did not know it, but because I knew that those who were present did not understand it, in order that you may state it more distinctly, so that they may perceive what are the reasons why we are carrying on this discussion.”  And Peter said:  “I cannot state the matter more clearly:  explain what meaning you have attached to the words.”  And Simon said:  “There is no necessity why I should state your opinions.”  And Peter said:  “You evidently, Simon, do not understand it, and yet you do not wish to confess, that you may not be detected in your ignorance, and thus be proved not to be the standing Son.  For you hint this, though you do not wish to state it plainly; and, indeed, I who am not a prophet, but a disciple of the true Prophet, know well from the hints you have given what your wishes are.  For you, though you do not understand even what is distinctly said, wish to call yourself son in opposition to us.”  And Simon said:  “I will remove every pretext from you.  I confess I do not understand what can be the meaning of the statement, The Son reveals <i>Him</i> to whomsoever He wishes.  State therefore what is its meaning more distinctly.”</p>
