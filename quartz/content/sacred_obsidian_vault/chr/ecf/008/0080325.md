 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.vii.xi-p2"></a>“But that which a prophet of the Jews foretold, that He was to be waited for by the Gentiles, <a name="fr_755"></a><a href="#fn_755"><font size="1">756</font></a>
  confirms above measure the faith of truth in Him.  For if he had said that He was to be waited for by the Jews, he would not have seemed to prophesy anything extraordinary, that He whose coming had been promised for the salvation of the world should be the object of hope to the people of the same tribe with Himself, and to His own nation:  for that this would take place, would seem rather to be a matter of natural inference than one requiring the grandeur of a prophetic utterance.  But now, whereas the prophets say that all that hope which is set forth concerning the salvation of the world, and the newness of the kingdom which is to be established by Christ, and all things which are declared concerning Him are to be transferred to the Gentiles; the grandeur of the prophetic office is confirmed, not according to the sequence of things, but by an incredible fulfilment of the prophecy.  For the Jews from the beginning had understood by a most certain tradition that this man should at some time come, by whom all things should be restored; and daily meditating and looking out for His coming, when they saw Him amongst them, and accomplishing the signs and miracles, as had been written of Him, being blinded with envy, they could not recognise Him when present, in the hope of whom they rejoiced while He was absent; yet the few of us who were chosen by Him understood it.</p>
