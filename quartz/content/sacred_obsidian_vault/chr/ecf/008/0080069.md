 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iii.vii-p2"></a>At length meetings began to be held in various places in the city, and this subject to be discussed in conversation, and to be a matter of wonder who this might be who had appeared, and what message He had brought from God to men; until, about the same year, a certain man, standing in a most crowded place in the city, made proclamation to the people, saying:  “Hear me, O ye citizens of Rome.  The Son of God is now in the regions of Judæa, promising eternal life to every one who will hear Him, but upon condition that he shall regulate his actions according to the will of Him by whom He hath been sent, even of God the Father.  Wherefore turn ye from evil things to good, from things temporal to things eternal.  Acknowledge that there is one God, ruler of heaven and earth, in whose righteous sight ye unrighteous inhabit His world.  But if ye be converted, and act according to His will, then, coming to the world to come, and being made immortal, ye shall enjoy His unspeakable blessings and rewards.” <a name="fr_535"></a><a href="#fn_535"><font size="1">536</font></a>
   Now, the man who spoke these things to the people was from the regions of the East, by nation a Hebrew, by name Barnabas, who said that he himself was one of His disciples, and that he was sent for this end, that he should declare these things to those who would hear them. <a name="fr_536"></a><a href="#fn_536"><font size="1">537</font></a>
   When I heard these things, I began, with the rest of the <a name="page_79"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 79</font></a> <a name="vi.iii.iii.vii-Page_79"></a>multitude, to follow him, and to hear what he had to say.  Truly I perceived that there was nothing of dialectic artifice in the man, but that he expounded with simplicity, and without any craft of speech, such things as he had heard from the Son of God, or had seen.  For he did not confirm his assertions by the force of arguments, but produced, from the people who stood round about him, many witnesses of the sayings and marvels which he related.</p>
