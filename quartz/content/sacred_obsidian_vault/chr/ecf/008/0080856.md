 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.x.xi-p2"></a>“Were I able to cause earthquakes, and do all that I wish, I assure you I would not destroy Simon and his friends (for not to destroy men am I sent), but would make him my friend, that he might no longer, by his slanders against my preaching the truth, hinder the salvation of many.  But if you believe me, he himself is a magician; he is a slanderer; he is a minister of evil to them who know not the truth.  Therefore he has power to bring diseases on sinners, having the sinners themselves to help him in his power over them.  But I am a servant of God the Creator of all things, and a disciple of His Prophet who is at His right hand.  Wherefore I, being His apostle, preach the truth:  to serve a good man I drive away diseases, for I am His second messenger, since first the disease comes, but after that the healing.  By that evil-working magician, then, you were stricken with disease because you revolted from God.  By me, if you believe on Him ye shall be cured:  and so having had experience that He is able, you may turn to good works, and have your souls saved.”</p>
