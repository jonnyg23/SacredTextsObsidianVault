 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xiv.x-p2"></a>“But it will be said that the cases are not parallel between God and man; and I admit that they are not parallel:  for the punishment is greater to him who is guilty of impiety against the greater, and less to him who sins against the less.  As, therefore, God is greatest of all, so he who is impious against Him shall endure greater punishment, as sinning against the greater; not through His defending Himself with His own hand, but the whole creation being indignant at him, and naturally taking vengeance on him.  For to the blasphemer the sun will not give his light, nor the earth her fruits, nor the fountain its water, nor in Hades shall he who is there constituted prince give rest to the soul; since even now, while the constitution of the world subsists, the whole creation is indignant at him.  Wherefore neither do <i>the clouds</i> afford sufficient rains, nor the earth fruits, whereby many perish; yea, even the air itself, inflamed with anger, is turned to pestilential courses.  However, whatsoever good things we enjoy, He of His mercy compels the creature to our benefits.  Still, against you who dishonour the Maker of all, the whole creation is hostile.</p>
