 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xi.v-p2"></a>“For even the Hebrews who believe Moses, and do not observe the things spoken by him, are not saved, unless they observe the things that were spoken to them.  For their believing Moses was not of their own will, but of God, who said to Moses, Behold, I come to thee in a pillar of cloud, that the people may hear me speaking to thee, and may believe thee for ever. <a name="fr_1091"></a><a href="#fn_1091"><font size="1">1092</font></a>
   Since, therefore, both to the Hebrews and to those who are called from the Gentiles, believing in the teachers of truth is of God, while excellent actions are left to every one to do by his own judgment, the reward is righteously bestowed upon those who do well.  For there would have been no need of Moses, or of the coming of Jesus, if of themselves they would have understood what is reasonable.  Neither is there salvation in believing in teachers and calling them lords.</p>
