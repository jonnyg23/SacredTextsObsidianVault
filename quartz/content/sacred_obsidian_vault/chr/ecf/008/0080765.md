 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.vii.iv-p2"></a>But Bernice, being asked, said:  “These things are indeed as you have heard; and I will tell you other things respecting this same Simon, which perhaps you do not know.  For he astonishes the whole city every day, by making spectres and ghosts appear in the midst of the market-place; and when he walks abroad, statues move, and many shadows go before him, which, he says, are souls of the dead.  And many who attempted to prove him an impostor he speedily reconciled to him; and afterwards, under pretence of a banquet, having slain an ox, and given them to eat of it, he infected them with various diseases, and subjected them to demons.  And in a word, having injured many, and being supposed to be a god, he is both feared and honoured.” <a name="fr_1030"></a><a href="#fn_1030"><font size="1">1031</font></a>
