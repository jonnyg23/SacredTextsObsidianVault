 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xi.xiv-p2"></a>“For after the intercourse, being asked to show what they were before, and being no longer able to do so, on account of their being unable to do aught else after their defilement, yet wishing to please their mistresses, instead of themselves, they showed the bowels <a name="fr_1099"></a><a href="#fn_1099"><font size="1">1100</font></a>
  of the earth; I mean, the choice metals, <a name="fr_1100"></a><a href="#fn_1100"><font size="1">1101</font></a>
  gold, brass, silver, iron, and the like, with all the most precious stones.  And along with these charmed stones, they delivered the arts of the things pertaining to each, and imparted the discovery of magic, and taught astronomy, and the powers of roots, and whatever was impossible to be found out by the human mind; also the melting of gold and silver, and the like, and the various dyeing of garments.  And all things, in short, which are for the adornment and delight of women, are the discoveries of these demons bound in flesh.</p>
