 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iii.xlvi-p2"></a>“But now also I shall, by a very short representation, recall you to the recollection of all these things.  In the present life, Aaron, the first high priest, <a name="fr_578"></a><a href="#fn_578"><font size="1">579</font></a>
  was anointed with a composition of chrism, which was made after the pattern of that spiritual ointment of which we have spoken before.  He was prince of the people, and as a king received first-fruits and tribute from the people, man by man; and having undertaken the office <a name="page_90"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 90</font></a> <a name="vi.iii.iii.xlvi-Page_90"></a>of judging the people, he judged of things clean and things unclean.  But if any one else was anointed with the same ointment, as deriving virtue from it, he became either king, or prophet, or priest.  If, then, this temporal grace, compounded by men, had such efficacy, consider now how potent was that ointment extracted by God from a branch of the tree of life, when that which was made by men could confer so excellent dignities among men.  For what in the present age is more glorious than a prophet, more illustrious than a priest, more exalted than a king?”</p>
