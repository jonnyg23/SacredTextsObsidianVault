 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xiv.xxix-p2"></a>“Therefore He made use of this memorable expression, speaking the truth with respect to the hypocrites of them, not with respect to all.  For to some He said that obedience was to be rendered, because they were entrusted with the chair of Moses.  However, to the hypocrites he said, Woe to you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for ye make clean the outside of the cup and the platter, but the inside is full of filth.  Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first the inside of the cup and the platter, that their outsides may be clean also.  And truly:  for when the mind is enlightened by knowledge, the disciple is able to be good, and thereupon purity follows; for from the understanding within a good care of the body without is produced.  As from negligence with respect to the body, care of the understanding cannot be produced, so the pure man can purify both that which is without and that which is within.  And he who, purifying the things without, does it looking to the praise of men, and by the praise of those who look on, he has nothing from God.</p>
