 <p class="c21"><a name="vii.v.xiv-p2"></a>And it came to pass some little time after, that an enrolment was made according to the edict of Cæsar Augustus, that all the world was to be enrolled, each man in his native place.  This enrolment was made by Cyrinus, the governor of Syria. <a name="fr_1639"></a><a href="#fn_1639"><font size="1">1640</font></a>
   It was necessary, therefore, that Joseph should enrol with the blessed Mary in Bethlehem, because to it they belonged, being of the tribe of Judah, and of the house and family of David.  When, therefore, Joseph and the blessed Mary were going along the road which leads to Bethlehem, Mary said to Joseph:  I see two peoples before me, the one weeping, and the other rejoicing.  And Joseph answered:  Sit still on thy beast, and do not speak superfluous words.  Then there appeared before them a beautiful boy, clothed in white raiment, who said to Joseph:  Why didst thou say that the words which Mary spoke about the two peoples were superfluous?  For she saw the people of the Jews weeping, because they have departed from their God; and the people of the Gentiles rejoicing, because they have now been added and made near to the Lord, according to that which He promised to our fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob:  for the time is at hand when in the seed of Abraham all nations shall be blessed. <a name="fr_1640"></a><a href="#fn_1640"><font size="1">1641</font></a>
 </p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vii.v.xiv-p5"></a>And when he had thus said, the angel ordered the beast to stand, for the time when she should bring forth was at hand; and he commanded the blessed Mary to come down off the animal, and go into a recess under a cavern, in which there never was light, but always darkness, because the light of day could not reach it.  And when the blessed Mary had gone into it, it began to shine with as much brightness as if it were the sixth hour of the day.  The light from God so shone in the cave, that neither by day nor night was light wanting as long as the blessed Mary was there.  And there she brought forth a son, and the angels surrounded Him when He was being born.  And as soon as He was born, He stood upon His feet, and the angels adored Him, saying:  Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men of good pleasure. <a name="fr_1641"></a><a href="#fn_1641"><font size="1">1642</font></a>
   Now, when the birth of the Lord was at hand, Joseph had gone away to seek midwives.  And when he had found them, he returned to the cave, and found with Mary the infant which she had brought forth.  And Joseph said to the blessed Mary:  I have brought thee two midwives—Zelomi <a name="fr_1642"></a><a href="#fn_1642"><font size="1">1643</font></a>
  and Salome; and they are standing outside before the entrance to the cave, not daring to come in hither, because of the exceeding brightness.  And when the blessed Mary heard this, she smiled; and Joseph said to her:  Do not smile; but prudently allow them to visit thee, in case thou shouldst require them for thy cure.  Then she ordered them to enter.  And when Zelomi had come in, Salome having stayed without, Zelomi said to Mary:  Allow me to touch thee.  And when she had permitted her to make an examination, the midwife cried out with a loud voice, and said:  Lord, Lord Almighty, mercy on us!  It has never been heard or thought of, that any one should have her breasts full of milk, and that the birth of a son should show his mother to be a virgin.  But there has been no spilling of blood in his birth, no pain in bringing him forth.  A virgin has conceived, a virgin has <a name="page_375"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 375</font></a> <a name="vii.v.xiv-Page_375"></a>brought forth, and a virgin she remains.  And hearing these words, Salome said:  Allow me to handle thee, and prove whether Zelomi have spoken the truth.  And the blessed Mary allowed her to handle her.  And when she had withdrawn her hand from handling her, it dried up, and through excess of pain she began to weep bitterly, and to be in great distress, crying out, and saying:  O Lord God, Thou knowest that I have always feared Thee, and that without recompense I have cared for all the poor; I have taken nothing from the widow and the orphan, and the needy have I not sent empty away.  And, behold, I am made wretched because of mine unbelief, since without a cause I wished to try Thy virgin.</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vii.v.xiv-p8"></a>And while she was thus speaking, there stood by her a young man in shining garments, saying:  Go to the child, and adore Him, and touch Him with thy hand, and He will heal thee, because He is the Saviour of the world, and of all that hope in Him.  And she went to the child with haste, and adored Him, and touched the fringe of the cloths in which He was wrapped, and instantly her hand was cured.  And going forth, she began to cry aloud, and to tell the wonderful things which she had seen, and which she had suffered, and how she had been cured; so that many through her statements believed.</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vii.v.xiv-p9"></a>And some shepherds also affirmed that they had seen angels singing a hymn at midnight, praising and blessing the God of heaven, and saying:  There has been born the Saviour of all, who is Christ the Lord, in whom salvation shall be brought back to Israel. <a name="fr_1643"></a><a href="#fn_1643"><font size="1">1644</font></a>
 </p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vii.v.xiv-p11"></a>Moreover, a great star, larger than any that had been seen since the beginning of the world, shone over the cave from the evening till the morning.  And the prophets who were in Jerusalem said that this star pointed out the birth of Christ, who should restore the promise not only to Israel, but to all nations.</p>
