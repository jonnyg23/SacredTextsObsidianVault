 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.x.lii-p2"></a>“Observe therefore in this, as I have said, how justly divine providence comes to the help of things vitiated; that, inasmuch as evils which had derived their origin from sin were associated with the good things of God, He should assign two chiefs to these two departments. <a name="fr_824"></a><a href="#fn_824"><font size="1">825</font></a>
   And <i>accordingly</i>, to Him who rejoices in good He has appointed the ordering of good things, that He might bring those who believe <i>in Him</i> to the faith of His providence; but to him who rejoices in evil, He has given over those things which are done without order and uselessly, from which of course the faith of His providence comes into doubt; and thus a just division has been made by a just God.  Hence therefore it is, that whereas the orderly course of the stars produces faith that the world was made by the hand of a designer, on the other hand, the disturbance of the air, the pestilent breeze, the uncontrolled fire of the lightning, cast doubt upon the work of providence.  For, as we have said, every good thing has its corresponding contrary evil thing joined with it; as hail is opposite to the fertilizing showers, the corruption of mildew is associated with the gentle dew, the whirlwinds of storms are joined with the soft winds, unfruitful trees with fruitful, noxious herbs with useful, wild and destructive animals with gentle ones.  But all these things are arranged by God, because that the choice of mens will has departed from the purpose of good, and fallen away to evil.</p>
