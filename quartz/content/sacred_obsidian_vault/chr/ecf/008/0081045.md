 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xviii.v-p2"></a>And our father began to say:  “Do not suppose, my dearest Peter, that I am not thinking of the doctrines preached by you.  I was thinking of them.  But during the past night, when Clement urged me earnestly to give in my adhesion to the truth preached by you, I at last answered, Why should I? for what new commandment can any one give more than what the ancients urged us to obey?  And he, with a gentle smile, said, There is a great difference, father, between the doctrines of the true religion and those of philosophy; <a name="fr_1228"></a><a href="#fn_1228"><font size="1">1229</font></a>
  for the true religion receives its proof from prophecy, while philoso<a name="page_310"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 310</font></a> <a name="vi.iv.xviii.v-Page_310"></a>phy, furnishing us with beautiful sentences, seems to present its proofs from conjecture.  On saying this, he took an instance, and set before us the doctrine of philanthropy, <a name="fr_1229"></a><a href="#fn_1229"><font size="1">1230</font></a>
  which you had explained to him, <a name="fr_1230"></a><a href="#fn_1230"><font size="1">1231</font></a>
  which rather appeared to me to be very unjust, and I shall tell you how.  He alleged that it was right to present to him who strikes you on the one cheek the other <a name="fr_1231"></a><a href="#fn_1231"><font size="1">1232</font></a>
  also, and to give to him who takes away your cloak your tunic also, and to go two miles with him who compels you to go one, and such like.” <a name="fr_1232"></a><a href="#fn_1232"><font size="1">1233</font></a>
