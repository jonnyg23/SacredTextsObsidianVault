 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iv.xxix-p2"></a>“Thus, therefore, our Master, inviting His disciples to patience, impressed upon them that the blessing of peace was also to be preserved with the labour of patience.  But, on the other hand, He mourned over those who lived in riches and luxury, who bestowed nothing upon the poor; proving that they must render an account, because they did not pity their neighbours, even when they were in poverty, whom they ought to love as themselves.  And by such sayings as these He brought some indeed to obey Him, but others He rendered hostile.  The believers therefore, and the obedient, He charges to have peace among themselves. and says to them, Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the very sons of God. <a name="fr_621"></a><a href="#fn_621"><font size="1">622</font></a>
   But to those who not only did not believe, but set themselves in opposition to His doctrine, He proclaims the war of the word and of confutation, and says that henceforth ye shall see son separated from father, and husband from wife, and daughter from mother, and brother from brother, and daughter-in-law from mother-in-law, and a mans foes shall be they of his own house. <a name="fr_622"></a><a href="#fn_622"><font size="1">623</font></a>
   For in every house, when there begins to be a difference betwixt believer and unbeliever, there is necessarily a contest:  the unbelievers, on the one hand, fighting against the faith; and the believers on the other, confuting the old error and the vices of sins in them.”</p>
