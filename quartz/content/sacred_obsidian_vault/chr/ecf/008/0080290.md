 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.vi.xiv-p2"></a>“Hence, since so many false and erratic religions have been introduced into the world, <a name="fr_734"></a><a href="#fn_734"><font size="1">735</font></a>
  we have been sent, as good merchants, bringing unto you the worship of the true God, handed down from the fathers, and preserved; as the seeds of which we scatter these words amongst you, and place it in your choice to choose what seems to you to be right.  For if you receive those things which we bring you, you shall not <a name="page_138"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 138</font></a> <a name="vi.iii.vi.xiv-Page_138"></a>only be able yourselves to escape the incursions of the demon, but also to drive them away from others; and at the same time you shall obtain the rewards of eternal good things.  But those who shall refuse to receive those things which are spoken by us, shall be subject in the present life to diverse demons and disorders of sicknesses, and their souls after their departure from the body shall be tormented for ever.  For God is not only good, but also just; for if He were always good, and never just to render to every one according to his deeds, goodness would be found to be injustice.  For it were injustice if the impious and the pious were treated by Him alike.</p>
