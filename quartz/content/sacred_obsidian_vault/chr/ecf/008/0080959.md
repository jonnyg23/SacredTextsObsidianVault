 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xiv.xxv-p2"></a>“Wherefore come readily, as a son to a father, that God may assign ignorance as the cause of your sins.  But if after being called you will not, or delay, you shall be destroyed by the just judgment of God, not being willed, through your not willing.  And do not think, though you were more pious than all the pious that ever were, but if you be unbaptized, that you shall ever obtain hope.  For all the more, on this account, you <a name="page_290"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 290</font></a> <a name="vi.iv.xiv.xxv-Page_290"></a>shall endure the greater punishment, because you have done excellent works not excellently.  For well-doing is excellent when it is done as God has commanded.  But if you will not be baptized according to His pleasure, you serve your own will and oppose His counsel.</p>
