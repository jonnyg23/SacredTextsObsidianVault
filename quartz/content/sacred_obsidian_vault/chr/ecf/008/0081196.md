 <p class="c21"><a name="vii.v.xix-p2"></a>And having come to a certain cave, and wishing to rest in it, the blessed <a name="fr_1659"></a><a href="#fn_1659"><font size="1">1660</font></a>
  Mary dismounted from her beast, and sat down with the child Jesus in her bosom.  And there were with Joseph three boys, and with Mary a girl, going on the journey along with them.  And, lo, suddenly there came forth from the cave many dragons; and when the children saw them, they cried out in great terror.  Then Jesus went down from the bosom of His mother, and stood on His feet before the dragons; and they adored Jesus, and thereafter retired.  Then was fulfilled that which was said by David the prophet, saying:  Praise the Lord from the earth, ye dragons; ye dragons, and all ye deeps. <a name="fr_1660"></a><a href="#fn_1660"><font size="1">1661</font></a>
   And the young child Jesus, walking before them, commanded them to hurt no man.  But Mary and Joseph were very much afraid lest the child should be hurt by the dragons.  And Jesus said to them:  Do not be afraid, and do not consider me to be a little child; for I am and always have been perfect; and all the beasts of the forest must needs be tame before me.</p>
