 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xxii.iv-p2"></a>And Peter said:  “It must be so.”  And Simon:  “Therefore, if he is originated, he has been made by that very God who made all things, being either born as an animal, or sent forth substantially, and resulting from an external mixture <i>of elements</i>.  For either <a name="fr_1415"></a><a href="#fn_1415"><font size="1">1416</font></a>
  the matter, being living or lifeless, from which he was made was outside of Him, <a name="fr_1416"></a><a href="#fn_1416"><font size="1">1417</font></a>
  or he came into being through God Himself, or through his own self, or he resulted from things non-existent, or he is a mere relative thing, or he always existed.  Having thus, as I think, clearly, pointed out all the possible ways by which we may find him, in going along some one of these we must find him.  We must therefore go along each one of these in search of his origin; and when we find him who is his author, we must perceive that he is to blame.  Or how does the matter seem to you?”</p>
