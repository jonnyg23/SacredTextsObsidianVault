 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.ix.xv-p2"></a>“Then Hera, and Athena, and Aphrodite, and Eris, and the apple, and Hermes, and the judgment, and the shepherd, have some such hidden meaning as the following:—Hera is dignity; Athena, manliness; Aphrodite, pleasure; Hermes, language, which interprets (<span class="c9"><a name="vi.iv.ix.xv-p2.1"></a>hermeneutikos</span>) thought; the shepherd Paris, unreasoned and brutish passion.  Now if, in the prime of life, reason, that shepherd of the soul, is brutish, does not regard its own advantage, will have nothing to do with manliness and temperance, chooses only pleasure, and gives the prize to lust alone, bargaining that it is to receive in return from lust what may delight it,—he who thus judges incorrectly will choose pleasure to his own destruction and that of his friends.  And Eris is jealous spite; and the golden apples of the Hesperides are perhaps riches, by which occasionally even temperate persons like Hera are seduced, and manly ones like Athena are made jealous, so that they do things which do not become them, and the souls beauty like Aphrodite is destroyed under the guise of refinement.  To speak briefly, in all men riches provoke evil discord.</p>
