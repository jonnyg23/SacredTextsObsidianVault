 <p class="c21"><a name="vii.v.xlii-p2"></a>And they went away from Capernaum into the city which is called Bethlehem; and Joseph lived with Mary in his own house, and Jesus with them.  And on a certain day Joseph called to him his first-born son James, <a name="fr_1687"></a><a href="#fn_1687"><font size="1">1688</font></a>
  and sent him into the vegetable garden to gather vegetables for the purpose of making broth.  And Jesus followed His brother James into the garden; but Joseph and Mary did not know this.  And while James was collecting the vegetables, a viper suddenly came out of a hole and struck his hand, <a name="fr_1688"></a><a href="#fn_1688"><font size="1">1689</font></a>
  and he began to cry out from excessive pain.  And, becoming exhausted, he said, with a bitter cry:  Alas! alas! an accursed viper has struck my hand.  And Jesus, who was standing opposite to him, at the bitter cry ran up to James, and took hold of his hand; and all that He did was to blow on the hand of James, and cool it:  and immediately James was healed, and the serpent died.  And Joseph and Mary did not know what had been done; but at the cry of James, and the command of Jesus, they ran to the garden, and found the serpent already dead, and James quite cured.</p>
