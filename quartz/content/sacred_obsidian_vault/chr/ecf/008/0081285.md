 <p class="c21"><a name="vii.xiii.xv-p2"></a>And a few days after there came from Galilee to Jerusalem three men.  One of them was a priest, by name Phinees; the second a Levite, by name Aggai; and the third a soldier, by name Adas.  These came to the chief priests, and said to them and to the people:  Jesus, whom you crucified, we have seen in Galilee with his eleven disciples upon the Mount of Olives, teaching them, and saying, Go into all the world, and proclaim the good news; and whosoever will believe and be baptized shall be saved; but whosoever will not believe shall be condemned.  And having thus spoken, he went up into heaven. <a name="fr_1922"></a><a href="#fn_1922"><font size="1">1923</font></a>
   And both we and many others of the five hundred <a name="fr_1923"></a><a href="#fn_1923"><font size="1">1924</font></a>
  besides were looking on.</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vii.xiii.xv-p5"></a>And when the chief priests and the Jews heard these things, they said to these three:  Give glory <a name="page_433"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 433</font></a> <a name="vii.xiii.xv-Page_433"></a>to the God of Israel, and repent of these lies that you have told.  They answered:  As the God of our fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob liveth, we do not lie, but tell you the truth.  Then the high priest spoke, and they brought the old <i>covenant</i> of the Hebrews out of the temple, and he made them swear, and giving them also money, he sent them into another place, in order that they might not proclaim in Jerusalem the resurrection of Christ.</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vii.xiii.xv-p6"></a>And when these stories had been heard by all the people, the crowd came together into the temple, and there was a great commotion.  For many said:  Jesus has risen from the dead, as we hear, and why did you crucify him?  And Annas and Caiaphas said:  Do not believe, ye Jews, what the soldiers say; and do not believe that they saw an angel coming down from heaven.  For we have given money to the soldiers, in order that they should not tell such tales to any one; and thus also have the disciples of Jesus given them money, in order that they should say that Jesus has risen from the dead.</p>
