 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xxiii.xviii-p2"></a>Then Peter promised to us to restore the shape of our father, and he said to him:  “Faustus, you heard how matters stand with us.  When, therefore, the deceptive shape which invests you has been useful to us, and you have assisted us in doing what I shall tell you to do, then I shall restore to you your true form, when <a name="page_345"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 345</font></a> <a name="vi.iv.xxiii.xviii-Page_345"></a>you have first performed my commands.”  And when my father said, “I shall do everything that is in my power most willingly; only restore to my own people my own form;” Peter answered, “You yourself heard with your own ears how those who went before me came back from Antioch, and said that Simon had been there, and had strongly excited the multitudes against me by calling me a magician and a murderer, a deceiver and a juggler, to such an extent that all the people there were eager to taste my flesh.  You will do, then, as I tell you.  You will leave Clement with me, and you will go before us into Antioch with your wife, and your sons Faustinus and Faustinianus.  And some others will accompany you whom I deem capable of helping forward my design.</p>
