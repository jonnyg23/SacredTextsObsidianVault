 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xiii.vi-p2"></a>“Therefore approach with confidence to God, you who at first were made to be rulers and <a name="page_281"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 281</font></a> <a name="vi.iv.xiii.vi-Page_281"></a>lords of all things:  ye who have His image in your bodies, have in like manner the likeness of His judgment in your minds.  Since, then, by acting like irrational animals, you have lost the soul of man from your soul, becoming like swine, you are the prey of demons.  If, therefore, you receive the law of God, you become men.  For it cannot be said to irrational animals, Thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt not steal, and so forth.  Therefore do not refuse, when invited, to return to your first nobility; for it is possible, if ye be conformed to God by good works.  And being accounted to be sons by reason of your likeness to Him, you shall be reinstated as lords of all.</p>
