 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iv.xl-p2"></a>When Peter had heard this, he answered:  “Fear nothing, Simon:  for, behold, we have neither shut our ears, nor fled; but we answer with words of truth to those things which you have spoken falsely, asserting this first, that there is one God, even the God of the Jews, who is the only God, the Creator of heaven and earth, who is also the God of all those whom you call gods.  If, then, I shall show you that none is superior to Him, but that He Himself is above all, you will confess that your error is above all.” <a name="fr_638"></a><a href="#fn_638"><font size="1">639</font></a>
   Then Simon said:  “Why, indeed, though I should be unwilling to confess it, would not the hearers who stand by charge me with unwillingness to profess the things that are true?”</p>
