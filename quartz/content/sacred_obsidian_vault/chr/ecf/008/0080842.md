 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.ix.xxiv-p2"></a>“And first, then, the four original elements cannot be God, because they have a cause.  Nor can that mixing be God, nor that compounding, nor that generating, nor that globe which surrounds the visible universe; nor the dregs which flow together in Hades, nor the water which floats over them; nor the fiery substance, nor the air which extends from it to our earth.  For the four elements, if they lay outside one another, could not have been mixed together so as to generate animal life without some great artificer.  If they have always been united, even in this case they are fitted together by an artistic mind to what is requisite for the limbs and parts of animals, that they may be able to preserve their respective proportions, may have a clearly defined shape, and that all the inward parts may attain the fitting coherency.  In the same way also the positions suitable for each are determined, and that very beautifully, by the artificer mind.  To be brief, in all other things which a living creature must have, this great being of the world is in no respect wanting.</p>
