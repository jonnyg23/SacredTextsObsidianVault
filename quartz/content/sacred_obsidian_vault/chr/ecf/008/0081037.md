 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xvii.x-p2"></a>Peter seeing this, said:  “Are you Faustus, the husband of this woman, and the father of her children?”  And he said:  “I am.”  And Peter said:  “How, then, did you relate to me your own history as if it were anothers; telling <a name="page_308"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 308</font></a> <a name="vi.iv.xvii.x-Page_308"></a>me of your toils, and sorrow, and burial?”  And our father answered:  “Being of the family of Cæsar, and not wishing to be discovered, I devised the narrative in anothers name, in order that it might not be perceived who I was.  For I knew that, if I were recognised, the governors in the place would learn this, and recall me to gratify Cæsar, and would bestow upon me that former prosperity to which I had formerly bidden adieu with all the resolution I could summon.  For I could not give myself up to a luxurious life when I had pronounced the strongest condemnation on myself, because I believed that I had been the cause of death to those who were loved by me.” <a name="fr_1211"></a><a href="#fn_1211"><font size="1">1212</font></a>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="vi.iv.xvii.x-p3"></a> Lit., “Having judged the greatest things in regard to those who were loved by me, as having died.”  The text is doubtful; for the first <i>Epitome</i> has something quite different.</p>
