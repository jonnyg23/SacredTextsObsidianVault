 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xviii.ii-p2"></a>Our father said:  “But it is not the case, my very dear friend, that souls are punished in Hades, for the soul is dissolved into air as soon as it leaves the body.”  And Peter said:  “Until we convince you in regard to this point, answer me, does it not appear to you that you are not grieved as having no faith in a <i>future</i> punishment, but they who have full faith in it must be vexed in regard to you?”  And our father said:  “You speak sense.”  And Peter said:  “Why, then, will you not free them from the greatest grief they can have in regard to you by agreeing to their religion, not, I mean, through dread, but through kindly feeling, listening and judging about what is said by me, whether it be so or not? and if the truth is as we state it, then here you will enjoy life with those who are dearest to you, and in the other world you will have rest with them; but if, in examining the arguments, you show that what is stated by us is a fictitious story, <a name="fr_1221"></a><a href="#fn_1221"><font size="1">1222</font></a>
  you will thus be doing good service, for you will have your friends on your side, and you will put an end to their leaning upon false hopes, and you will free them from false fears.”</p>
