 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.vi.xlv-p2"></a>“But that He is not pleased with sacrifices, is shown by this, that those who lusted after flesh were slain as soon as they tasted it, and were consigned to a tomb, so that it was called the grave of lusts. <a name="fr_987"></a><a href="#fn_987"><font size="1">988</font></a>
   He then who at the first was displeased with the slaughtering of animals, not wishing them to be slain, did not ordain sacrifices as desiring them; nor from the beginning did He require them.  For neither are sacrifices accomplished without the slaughter of animals, nor can the first-fruits be presented.  But how is it possible for Him to abide in darkness, and smoke, and storm (for this also is written), who created a pure heaven, and created the sun to give light to all, and assigned the invariable order of their revolutions to innumerable stars?  Thus, O Simon, the handwriting of God—I mean the heaven—shows the counsels of Him who made it to be pure and stable.</p>
