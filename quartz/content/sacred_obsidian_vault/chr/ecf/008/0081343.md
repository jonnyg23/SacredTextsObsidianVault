 <p class="c21"><a name="vii.xvii.xi-p2"></a>And when the paper was finished and read through, all that heard it fell on their faces, weeping bitterly, and cruelly beating their breasts, crying out, and saying through all:  Woe to us!  Why has this happened to us wretched?  Pilate flees; Annas and Caiaphas flee; the priests and Levites flee; moreover also the people of the Jews, weeping and saying, Woe to us wretched! we have shed sacred blood upon the earth.</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vii.xvii.xi-p3"></a>For three days, therefore, and three nights, they did not taste bread and water at all; nor did any of them return to the synagogue.  But on the third day again the council was assembled, and the other paper of Leucius was read through; and it was found neither more nor less, to a single letter, than that which the writing of Karinus contained.  Then the synagogue was perplexed; and they all lamented forty days and forty nights, looking for destruction from God, and the vengeance of God.  But He, pitier affectionate and most high, did not immediately destroy them, bountifully giving them a place of repentance.  But they were not found worthy to be turned to the Lord.</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vii.xvii.xi-p4"></a>These are the testimonies of Karinus and Leucius, dearest brethren, concerning Christ the Son of God, and His holy deeds in the lower world; to whom let us all give praise and glory through immeasurable age of ages.  Amen.</p>
