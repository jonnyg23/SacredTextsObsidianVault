 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iii.lxviii-p2"></a>“These sayings of Gamaliel did not much please Caiaphas; and holding him in suspicion, as it seemed, he began to insinuate himself cunningly into the discussions:  for, smiling at what Gamaliel had said, the chief of the priests asked of James, the chief of the bishops, <a name="fr_593"></a><a href="#fn_593"><font size="1">594</font></a>
  that the discourse concerning Christ should not be drawn but from the Scriptures; that we may know, said he, whether Jesus be the very Christ or no.  Then said James, We must first inquire from what Scriptures we are especially to derive our discussion.  Then he, with difficulty, at length overcome by reason, answered, that it must be derived from the law; and afterwards he made mention also of the prophets.”</p>
