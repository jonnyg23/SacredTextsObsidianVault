 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.ix.xiv-p2"></a>Then Peter said:  “Do you think, O woman, that those who destroy themselves are set free from torments, and not rather that the souls of those who lay violent hands upon themselves are subjected to greater punishments?”  Then said she:  “I wish I were sure that souls live in the infernal regions, for I would gladly embrace the suffering of the penalty of suicide, only that I might see my darling children, if it were but for an hour.”  Then Peter:  “What thing is it so great, that effects you with so heavy sadness?  I should like to know.  For if you informed me of the cause, I might be able both to show you clearly, O woman, that souls do live in the infernal regions; and instead of the precipice or the deep sea, I might give you some remedy, that you may be able to end your life without torment.”</p>
