 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.vii.xiii-p2"></a>“Wherefore awake, and take to yourselves our Lord and God, even that Lord who is Lord both of heaven and earth, and conform yourselves to His image and likeness, as the true Prophet Himself teaches, saying, Be ye merciful, as also your heavenly Father is merciful, who makes His sun to rise upon the good and the evil, and rains upon the just and the unjust. <a name="fr_758"></a><a href="#fn_758"><font size="1">759</font></a>
   Imitate Him, therefore, and fear Him, as the commandment is given to men, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve. <a name="fr_759"></a><a href="#fn_759"><font size="1">760</font></a>
   For it is profitable to you to serve this Lord alone, that through Him knowing the one God, ye may be freed from the many whom ye vainly feared.  For he who fears not God the Creator of all, but fears those whom he himself with his own hands hath made, what does he do but make himself subject to a vain and senseless fear, and render himself more vile and abject than those very things, the fear of which he has conceived in his mind?  But rather, by the goodness of Him who inviteth you, return to your former nobleness, and by good deeds show that you bear the image of your Creator, that by contemplation of His likeness ye may be believed to be even His sons.</p>
