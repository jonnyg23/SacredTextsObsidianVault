 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.vi.x-p2"></a>“Therefore Simon, who is going to discuss in public with us to-morrow, is bold against the monarchy of God, wishing to produce many statements from these Scriptures, to the effect that there are many gods, and a certain one who is not He who made this world, but who is superior to Him; and, at the same time, he is going to offer many scriptural proofs.  But we also can easily show many passages from them that He who made the world alone is God, and that there is none other besides Him.  But if any one shall wish to speak otherwise, he also shall be able to produce proofs from them at his pleasure.  For the Scriptures say all manner of things, that no one of those who inquire ungratefully may find the truth, but simply what he wishes to find, the truth being reserved for the grateful now gratitude is to preserve our love to Him who is the cause of our being.</p>
