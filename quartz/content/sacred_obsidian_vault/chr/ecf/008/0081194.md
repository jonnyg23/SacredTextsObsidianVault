 <p class="c21"><a name="vii.v.xvii-p2"></a>And when the second year was past, <a name="fr_1651"></a><a href="#fn_1651"><font size="1">1652</font></a>
  Magi came from the east to Jerusalem, bringing great gifts.  And they made strict inquiry of the Jews, saying:  Where is the king who has been born to you? for we have seen his star in the east, and have come to worship him.  And word of this came to King Herod, and so alarmed him that he called together the scribes and the Pharisees, and the teachers of the people, asking of them where the prophets had foretold that Christ should be born.  And they said:  In Bethlehem of Judah.  For it is written:  And thou Bethelehem, in the land of Judah, art by no means the least among the princes of Judah; for out of thee shall come forth a Leader who shall <a name="page_376"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 376</font></a> <a name="vii.v.xvii-Page_376"></a>rule my people Israel. <a name="fr_1652"></a><a href="#fn_1652"><font size="1">1653</font></a>
   Then King Herod summoned the magi to him, and strictly inquired of them when the star appeared to them.  Then, sending them to Bethlehem, he said:  Go and make strict inquiry about the child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.  And while the magi were going on their way, there appeared to them the star, which was, as it were, a guide to them, going before them until they came to where the child was.  And when the magi saw the star, they rejoiced with great joy; and going into the house, they saw the child Jesus sitting in His mothers lap.  Then they opened their treasures, and presented great gifts to the blessed Mary and Joseph.  And to the child Himself they offered each of them a piece of gold. <a name="fr_1653"></a><a href="#fn_1653"><font size="1">1654</font></a>
   And likewise one gave gold, another frankincense, and the third myrrh. <a name="fr_1654"></a><a href="#fn_1654"><font size="1">1655</font></a>
   And when they were going to return to King Herod, they were warned by an angel in their sleep not to go back to Herod; and they returned to their own country by another road. <a name="fr_1655"></a><a href="#fn_1655"><font size="1">1656</font></a>
