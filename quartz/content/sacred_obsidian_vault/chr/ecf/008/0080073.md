 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iii.xi-p2"></a>At length I said to him, “Only expound to me the doctrine of that man who you say has appeared, and I will arrange your sayings in my language, and will preach the kingdom and righteousness of Almighty God; and after that, if you wish it, I shall even sail along with you, for I am extremely desirous to see Judæa, and perhaps I shall remain with you always.”  To this he answered, “If indeed you wish to see our country, and to learn those things which you desire, set sail with me even now; or, if there be anything that detains you now, I shall leave with you directions to my dwelling, so that when you please to come you may easily find me; for tomorrow I shall set out on my journey.”  When I saw him determined, I went down with him to the harbour, and carefully took from him the directions which he gave me to find his dwelling.  I told him that, but for the necessity of getting some money which was due to me, I should not at all delay, but that I should speedily follow him.  Having told him this, I commended him to the kindness of those who had charge of the ship, and returned sad; for I was possessed of the memory of the intercourse which I had had with an excellent guest and a choice friend.</p>
