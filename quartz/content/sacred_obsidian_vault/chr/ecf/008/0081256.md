 <p class="c21"><a name="vii.xii.iv-p2"></a>And Pilate, filled with rage, went outside of the prætorium, and said to them:  I take the sun to witness <a name="fr_1817"></a><a href="#fn_1817"><font size="1">1818</font></a>
  that I find no fault in this man.  The Jews answered and said to the procurator:  Unless this man were an evil-doer, we should not have delivered him to thee.  And Pilate said, Do you take him, and judge him according to your law.  The Jews said to Pilate:  It is not lawful for us to put any one to death.  Pilate said:  Has God said that you are not to put to death, but that I am?</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vii.xii.iv-p4"></a>And Pilate went again into the prætorium, and spoke to Jesus privately, and said to Him:  Art thou the king of the Jews?  Jesus answered Pilate:  Dost thou say this of thyself, or have others said it to thee of me?  Pilate answered Jesus:  Am I also a Jew? <a name="fr_1818"></a><a href="#fn_1818"><font size="1">1819</font></a>
   Thy nation and the chief priests have given thee up to me.  What hast thou done?  Jesus answered:  My kingdom is not of this world; for if my kingdom were of this world, my servants would fight in order that I should not be given up to the Jews:  but now my kingdom is not from thence.  Pilate said to Him:  Art thou then a king?  Jesus answered him:  Thou sayest that I am a king.  Because for this have I been born, and have I come, in order that every one who is of the truth might hear my voice.  Pilate says to him:  What is truth?  Jesus says to him:  Truth is from heaven.  Pilate says:  Is truth not upon earth?  Jesus says to Pilate:  Thou seest how those who speak the truth are judged by those that have the power upon earth.</p>
