 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.ix.iv-p2"></a>But when they were gone, I Clement rejoiced greatly because he had kept me with himself, and I said to him:  “I give thanks to God that you have not sent me forward with the others, for I should have died through sadness.”  Then said Peter:  “And what will happen if necessity shall demand that you be sent anywhere for the purpose of teaching?  Would you die if you were separated from me for a good purpose?  Would you not put a restraint upon yourself, to bear patiently what necessity has laid upon you?  Or do you not know that friends are always together, and are joined in memory, though they be separated bodily; as, on the other hand, some persons are near to one another in body, but are separate in mind?”</p>
