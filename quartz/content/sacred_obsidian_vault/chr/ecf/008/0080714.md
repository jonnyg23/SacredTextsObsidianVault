 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.vi.xxvii-p2"></a>“And what need is there to say more?  The male is wholly truth, the female wholly falsehood.  But he who is born of the male and the female, in some things speaks truth, in some falsehood.  For the female, surrounding the white seed of the male with her own blood, as with red fire, sustains her own weakness with the extraneous supports of bones, and, pleased with the temporary flower of flesh, and spoiling the strength of the judgment by short pleasures, leads the greater part into fornication, and thus deprives them of the coming excellent Bridegroom.  For every person is a bride, whenever, being sown with the true Prophets whole word of truth, he is enlightened in his understanding.</p>
