 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xix.iv-p2"></a>Our father answered:  “Do not compel me to agree with you without any exercise of my judgment in order that I may seem to be a <a name="page_313"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 313</font></a> <a name="vi.iv.xix.iv-Page_313"></a>truth-loving judge; but if you wish me to tell you the truth, my prepossessions are rather the side of your opinions.”  And Simon said:  “How is this the case, when you do not know what my opinions are?”  And our father said:  “It is easy to know this, and I will tell you how.  You promised that you would convict Peter of error in maintaining the unity of God; but if one undertakes to convict of error him who maintains the unity of God. it is perfectly plain that he, as being in the right, <a name="fr_1252"></a><a href="#fn_1252"><font size="1">1253</font></a>
  does not hold the same opinion.  For if he holds the same opinion as the man who is thoroughly in error, then he himself is in error; but if he gives his proofs holding opposite opinions, then he is in the right.  Not well <a name="fr_1253"></a><a href="#fn_1253"><font size="1">1254</font></a>
  then do you assert that he who maintains the unity of God is wrong, unless you believe that there are many gods.  Now I maintain that there are many gods.  Holding, therefore, the same opinion as you before the discussion, I am prepossessed rather in your favour.  For this reason you ought to have no anxiety in regard to me, but Peter ought, for I still hold opinions contrary to his.  And so after your discussion I hope that, as a truth-loving judge, who has stripped himself of his prepossessions, I shall agree to that doctrine which gains the victor.”  When my father said this, a murmur of applause burst insensibly from the multitudes because my father had thus spoken.</p>
