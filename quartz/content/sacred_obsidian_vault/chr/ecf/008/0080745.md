 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.vi.lviii-p2"></a>Therefore Simon, perceiving that Peter was driving him to use the Scriptures as Jesus taught, was unwilling that the discussion should go into the doctrine concerning God, even although Peter had changed the discussion into question and answer, as Simon himself asked.  However, the discussion occupied three days. <a name="fr_1018"></a><a href="#fn_1018"><font size="1">1019</font></a>
   And while the fourth was dawning, he set off darkling as far as Tyre of Phœnicia. <a name="fr_1019"></a><a href="#fn_1019"><font size="1">1020</font></a>
   And not many days after, some of the precursors came and said to Peter:  “Simon is doing great miracles in Tyre, and disturbing many of the people there; and by many slanders he has made you to be hated.”</p>
