 </p><p class="c24"><a name="iii.XL-p1"></a><span class="c9"><a name="iii.XL-p1.1"></a>Homily XL.</span></p>  
 <p class="c47"><a name="iii.XL-p2"></a><span class="c1"><a name="iii.XL-p2.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#009">Matt. 12:9</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#010">10</a><a name="iii.XL-p2.2"></a>.</span></p>  
 <p class="c48"><a name="iii.XL-p3"></a>“And when He was departed thence, He went into their synagogue: and, behold, a man which had his hand withered.”</p>  
 <p class="c12"><a name="iii.XL-p4"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iii.XL-p4.1"></a>Again</span> He heals on a Sabbath day, vindicating what had been done by His disciples. And the other evangelists indeed say, that He “set” the man “in the midst,” and asked them, “If it was lawful to do good on the Sabbath days.” <a name="fr_1675"></a><a href="#fn_1675"><font size="1">1676</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p class="c13"><a name="iii.XL-p6"></a>See the tender bowels of the Lord. “He set him in the midst,” that by the sight He might subdue them; that overcome by the spectacle they might cast away their wickedness, and out of a kind of shame towards the man, cease from their savage ways. But they, ungentle and inhuman, choose rather to hurt the fame of Christ, than to see this person made whole: in both ways betraying their wickedness; by their warring against Christ, and by their doing so with such contentiousness, as even to treat with despite His mercies to other men.</p>  
 <p class="c13"><a name="iii.XL-p7"></a>And while the other evangelists say, He asked the question, this one saith, it was asked of Him. “And they asked Him,” so it stands, “saying, Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath days? that they might accuse Him.” <a name="fr_1676"></a><a href="#fn_1676"><font size="1">1677</font></a>
 And it is likely that both took place. For being unholy wretches, and well assured that He would doubtless proceed to the healing, they hastened to take Him beforehand with their question, thinking in this way to hinder Him. And this is why they asked, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath days?” not for information, but that “they might accuse Him.” Yet surely the work was enough, if it were really their wish to accuse Him; but they desired to find a handle in His words too, preparing for themselves beforehand an abundance of arguments. </p>   
 <p class="c13"><a name="iii.XL-p9"></a>But He in His love towards man doth this also: He answers them, teaching His own meekness, and turning it all back upon them; and points out their inhumanity. And He “setteth” the man “in the midst;” not in fear of them, but endeavoring to profit them, and move them to pity.</p>  
 <p class="c13"><a name="iii.XL-p10"></a>But when not even so did He prevail with them, then was He grieved, it is said, and wroth with them for the hardness of their heart, and He saith,</p>  
 <p class="c13"><a name="iii.XL-p11"></a>“What man is there among you that shall have one sheep, and if this fall into a pit on the Sabbath days, will he not lay hold of it, and lift it out? How much then is a man better than a sheep? <a name="fr_1677"></a><a href="#fn_1677"><font size="1">1678</font></a>
 Wherefore it is lawful to do well <a name="fr_1678"></a><a href="#fn_1678"><font size="1">1679</font></a>
 on the Sabbath days.” <a name="fr_1679"></a><a href="#fn_1679"><font size="1">1680</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p class="c13"><a name="iii.XL-p15"></a>Thus, lest they have ground of obstinacy, and of accusing him again of transgression, He convicts them by this example. And do thou mark, I pray thee, how variously and suitably in each case, He introduces His pleas for the breaking of the sabbath. Thus, first, in the case of the blind man, <a name="fr_1680"></a><a href="#fn_1680"><font size="1">1681</font></a>
 He doth not so much as defend Himself to them, when He made the clay: and yet then also were they blaming Him; but the manner of the creation was enough to indicate the Lord and Owner <a name="fr_1681"></a><a href="#fn_1681"><font size="1">1682</font></a>
 of the law. Next, in the case of the paralytic, when he carried his bed, and they were finding fault, <a name="fr_1682"></a><a href="#fn_1682"><font size="1">1683</font></a>
 He defends Himself, now as God, and now as man; as man, when He saith, “If a man on the Sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law should not be broken;” (and He said not “that a man should be profited”); “are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the Sabbath day?” <a name="fr_1683"></a><a href="#fn_1683"><font size="1">1684</font></a>
 As God again, when He saith, “My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.” <a name="fr_1684"></a><a href="#fn_1684"><font size="1">1685</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p class="c13"><a name="iii.XL-p21"></a>But when blamed for His disciples, He said, “Have ye not read what David did, when he was an hungered, himself and they that were with him, how he entered into the house of God, and did eat the show-bread?” <a name="fr_1685"></a><a href="#fn_1685"><font size="1">1686</font></a>
 He brings forward the priests also. </p>   
 <p class="c13"><a name="iii.XL-p23"></a>And here again; “Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath days, or to do evil? <a name="fr_1686"></a><a href="#fn_1686"><font size="1">1687</font></a>
 Which of you shall have one sheep?” For He knew their love of wealth, that they were all  <a name="page_255"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 255</font></a> <a name="iii.XL-Page_255"></a>  taken up with it, rather than with love of mankind. And indeed the other evangelist saith, <a name="fr_1687"></a><a href="#fn_1687"><font size="1">1688</font></a>
 that He also looked about upon them when asking these questions, that by His very eye He might win them over; but not even so did they become better. </p>   
 <p class="c13"><a name="iii.XL-p26"></a>And yet here He speaks only; whereas elsewhere in many cases He heals by laying on of hands also. But nevertheless none of these things made them meek; rather, while the man was healed, they by his health became worse.</p>  
 <p class="c13"><a name="iii.XL-p27"></a>For His desire indeed was to cure them before him, and He tried innumerable ways of healing, both by what He did in their presence, and by what He said: but since their malady after all was incurable, He proceeded to the work. “Then saith He to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it forth, and it was restored whole, like as the other.” <a name="fr_1688"></a><a href="#fn_1688"><font size="1">1689</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p class="c13"><a name="iii.XL-p29"></a>2. What then did they? They go forth, it is said, and take counsel together to slay Him. For “the Pharisees,” saith the Scripture, “went out and held a council against Him, how they might destroy Him.” <a name="fr_1689"></a><a href="#fn_1689"><font size="1">1690</font></a>
 They had received no injury, yet they went about to slay Him. So great an evil is envy. For not against strangers only, but even against our own, is it ever warring. And Mark saith, they took this counsel with the Herodians. <a name="fr_1690"></a><a href="#fn_1690"><font size="1">1691</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p class="c13"><a name="iii.XL-p32"></a>What then doth the gentle and meek One? He withdrew, on being aware of it. “But when Jesus knew their devices, <a name="fr_1691"></a><a href="#fn_1691"><font size="1">1692</font></a>
 He withdrew Himself,” it is said, “from them.” <a name="fr_1692"></a><a href="#fn_1692"><font size="1">1693</font></a>
 Where now are they who say, miracles ought to be done? Nay, by these things He signified, that the uncandid soul is not even thereby persuaded; and He made it plain that His disciples too were blamed by them without cause. This however we should observe, that they grow fierce especially at the benefits done to their neighbors; and when they see any one delivered either from disease or from wickedness, then is the time for them to find fault, and become wild beasts. Thus did they calumniate Him, both when He was about to save the harlot, and when He was eating with publicans, and now again, when they saw the hand restored. </p>   
 <p class="c13"><a name="iii.XL-p35"></a>But do thou observe, I pray thee, how He neither desists from His tender care over the infirm, and yet allays their envy. “And great multitudes <a name="fr_1693"></a><a href="#fn_1693"><font size="1">1694</font></a>
 followed Him, and He healed them all; and He charged them that were healed, that they should make Him known to no man.” <a name="fr_1694"></a><a href="#fn_1694"><font size="1">1695</font></a>
 Because, while the multitudes everywhere both admire and follow Him, they desist not from their wickedness. </p>   
 <p class="c13"><a name="iii.XL-p38"></a>Then, lest thou shouldest be confounded at what is going on, and at their strange frenzy, He introduces the prophet also, foretelling all this. For so great was the accuracy of the prophets, that they omit not even these things, but foretell His very journeyings, and changes of place, and the intent with which He acted therein; that thou mightest learn, how they spake all by the Spirit. For if the secrets of men cannot by any art be known, much more were it impossible to learn Christs purpose, except the Spirit revealed it. <a name="fr_1695"></a><a href="#fn_1695"><font size="1">1696</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p class="c13"><a name="iii.XL-p40"></a>What then saith the prophet? Nay, it is subjoined: “That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the Prophet, saying, Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased. I will put my Spirit upon Him, and He shall show judgment to the Gentiles. He shall not strive nor cry, <a name="fr_1696"></a><a href="#fn_1696"><font size="1">1697</font></a>
 neither shall any man hear His voice in the streets. A bruised reed shall He not break, and smoking flax shall He not quench, till He send forth judgment unto victory. And in His name shall the Gentiles trust.” <a name="fr_1697"></a><a href="#fn_1697"><font size="1">1698</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p class="c13"><a name="iii.XL-p43"></a>The prophet celebrates His meekness, and His unspeakable power, and opens to the Gentiles “a great door and effectual;” he foretells also the ills that are to overtake the Jews, and signifies His unanimity with the Father. For “behold,” saith He, “my servant, whom I have chosen, my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased.” Now if He chose Him, not as an adversary doth Christ set aside the law, nor as being an enemy of the lawgiver, but as having the same mind with Him, and the same objects.</p>  
 <p class="c13"><a name="iii.XL-p44"></a>Then proclaiming His meekness, he saith, “He shall not strive nor cry.” For His desire indeed was to heal in their presence; but since they thrust Him away, not even against this did He contend.</p>  
 <p class="c13"><a name="iii.XL-p45"></a>And intimating both His might, and their weakness, he saith, “A bruised reed shall He not break.” For indeed it was easy to break them all to pieces like a reed, and not a reed merely, but one already bruised.</p>  
 <p class="c13"><a name="iii.XL-p46"></a>“And smoking flax shall He not quench.” Here he sets forth both their anger that is kindled, and His might that is able to put  <a name="page_256"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 256</font></a> <a name="iii.XL-Page_256"></a>  down their anger, and to quench it with all ease; whereby His great mildness is signified.</p>  
 <p class="c13"><a name="iii.XL-p47"></a>What then? Shall these things always be? And will He endure them perpetually, forming such frantic plots against Him? Far from it; but when He hath performed His part, then shall He execute the other purposes also. For this He declared by saying “Till He send forth judgment unto victory: and in His name shall the Gentiles trust.” As Paul likewise saith, “Having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.” <a name="fr_1698"></a><a href="#fn_1698"><font size="1">1699</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p class="c13"><a name="iii.XL-p49"></a>But what is, “when He sends forth judgment unto victory?” When He hath fulfilled all His own part, then, we are told, He will bring down upon them His vengeance also, and that a perfect vengeance. Then shall they suffer His terrors, when His trophy is gloriously set up, and the ordinances that proceed from Him have prevailed, and He hath left them no plea of contradiction, however shameless. For He is wont to call righteousness, “judgment.”</p>  
 <p class="c13"><a name="iii.XL-p50"></a>But not to this will His dispensation be confined, to the punishment of unbelievers only, but He will also win to Himself the whole world. Wherefore He added, “And in His name shall the Gentiles trust.”</p>  
 <p class="c13"><a name="iii.XL-p51"></a>Then, to inform thee that this too is according to the purpose of the Father, in the beginning the prophet had assured us of this likewise, together with what had gone before; saying, “My well-beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased.” For of the well-beloved it is quite evident that He did these things also according to the mind of the beloved. <a name="fr_1699"></a><a href="#fn_1699"><font size="1">1700</font></a>
 becoming worse than the heathens? Wherefore also I do exceedingly grieve, that we who are commanded to copy the angels, or rather the Lord of the angels, emulate the devil. For indeed there is much envy, even in the church; and more among us, than among those under authority. Wherefore we must even discourse unto ourselves. </p>   
 <p class="c13"><a name="iii.XL-p53"></a>5. Tell me then, why dost thou envy thy neighbor? Because thou seest him reaping honor, and words of good report? Then dost thou not bear in mind how much evil honors bring on the unguarded? lifting them up to pride, to vainglory, to arrogance, to contemptuousness; making them more careless? and besides these evils, they wither also lightly away. For the most grievous thing is this, that the evils arising therefrom abide immortal, but the pleasure at the moment of its appearing, is flown away. For these things then dost thou envy? tell me.</p>  
 <p class="c13"><a name="iii.XL-p54"></a>“But he hath great influence with the Ruler, and leads and drives all things which way he will, and inflicts pain on them that offend him, and benefits his flatterers, and hath much power.” These are the sayings of secular persons, and of men that are riveted to the earth. For the spiritual man nothing shall be able to hurt.</p>  
 <p class="c13"><a name="iii.XL-p55"></a>For what serious harm shall he do to him? vote him out of his office? And what of that? For if it be justly done, he is even profited; for nothing so provokes God, as for one to hold the priests office unworthily. But if unjustly, the blame again falls on the other, not on him; for he who hath suffered anything unjustly, and borne it nobly, obtains in this way the greater confidence towards God.</p>  
 <p class="c13"><a name="iii.XL-p56"></a>Let us not then aim at this, how we may be in places of power, and honor, and authority, but that we may live in virtue and self denial. For indeed places of authority persuade men to do many things which are  <a name="page_257"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 257</font></a> <a name="iii.XL-Page_257"></a>  not approved of God; and great vigor of soul is needed, in order to use authority aright. For as he that is deprived thereof, practises self restraint, whether with or against his will, so he that enjoys it is in some such condition, as if any one living with a graceful and beautiful damsel were to receive rules never to look upon her unchastely. For authority is that kind of thing. Wherefore many, even against their will, hath it induced to show insolence; it awakens wrath, and removes the bridle from the tongue, and tears off the door of the lips; fanning the soul as with a wind, and sinking the bark in the lowest depth of evils. Him then who is in so great danger dost thou admire, and sayest thou he is to be envied? Nay, how great madness is here! Consider, at any rate (besides what we have mentioned), how many enemies and accusers, and how many flatterers this person hath besieging him. Are these then, I pray thee, reasons for calling a man happy? Nay, who can say so?</p>  
 <p class="c13"><a name="iii.XL-p57"></a>“But the people,” you say, “hold high account of him.” And what is this? For the people surely is not God, to whom he is to render account: so that in naming the people, thou art speaking of nothing else than of other breakers, and rocks, and shoals, and sunken ridges. For to be in favor with the people, the more it makes a man illustrious, the greater the dangers, the cares, the despondencies it brings with it. For such an one has no power at all to take breath or stand still, having so severe a master. And why say I, “stand still and take breath”? Though such an one have never so many good works, hardly doth he enter into the kingdom. For nothing is so wont to overthrow <a name="fr_1700"></a><a href="#fn_1700"><font size="1">1701</font></a>
 men, as the honor which comes of the multitude, making them cowardly, ignoble, flatterers, hypocrites. </p>   
 <p class="c13"><a name="iii.XL-p59"></a>Why, for instance, did the Pharisees say that Christ was possessed? Was it not because they were greedy of the honor of the multitude?</p>  
 <p class="c13"><a name="iii.XL-p60"></a>And whence did the multitude pass the right judgment on Him? Was it not because this disease had no hold on them? For nothing, nothing so much tends to make men lawless and foolish, as gaping after the honor of the multitude. Nothing makes them glorious and immoveable, like despising the same.</p>  
 <p class="c13"><a name="iii.XL-p61"></a>Wherefore also great vigor of soul is needed for him who is to hold out against such an impulse, and so violent a blast. For as when things are prosperous, he prefers himself to all, so when he undergoes the contrary, he would fain bury himself alive: and this is to him both hell, and the kingdom, when he hath come to be overwhelmed by this passion.</p>  
 <p class="c13"><a name="iii.XL-p62"></a>Is all this then, I pray thee, matter of envyings, and not rather of lamentations and tears? Every one surely can see. But thou doest the same, in envying one in that kind of credit, as if a person, seeing another bound and scourged and torn by innumerable wild beasts, were to envy him his wounds and stripes. For in fact, as many men as the multitude comprises, so many bonds also, so many tyrants hath he: and, what is yet more grievous, each of these hath a different mind: and they all judge whatever comes into their heads concerning him that is a slave to them, without examining into anything; but whatever is the decision of this or that person, this they also confirm.</p>  
 <p class="c13"><a name="iii.XL-p63"></a>What manner of waves then, what tempest so grievous as this? Yea, such a one is both puffed up in a moment by the pleasure, and is under water again easily, being ever in fluctuation, in tranquillity never. Thus, before the time of the assembly, and of the contests in speaking, he is possessed with anxiety and fear; but after the assembly he is either dead with despondency, or rejoices on the contrary without measure; a worse thing than sorrow. For that pleasure is not a less evil than sorrow is plain from the effect it has on the soul; how light it makes it, and unsteady, and fluttering.</p>  
 <p class="c13"><a name="iii.XL-p64"></a>And this one may see even from those of former times. When, for instance, was David to be admired; when he rejoiced, or when he was in anguish? When, the people of the Jews? groaning and calling upon God, or exulting in the wilderness, and worshipping the calf? Wherefore Solomon too, who best of all men knew what pleasure is, saith, “It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to the house of laughter.” <a name="fr_1701"></a><a href="#fn_1701"><font size="1">1702</font></a>
 Wherefore Christ also blesses the one, saying, “Blessed are they that mourn,” <a name="fr_1702"></a><a href="#fn_1702"><font size="1">1703</font></a>
 but the other sort He bewails, saying, “Woe unto you that laugh, for ye shall weep.” <a name="fr_1703"></a><a href="#fn_1703"><font size="1">1704</font></a>
 And very fitly. For in delight the soul is more relaxed and effeminate, but in mourning it is braced up, and grows sober, and is delivered from the whole swarm of passions, and becomes higher and stronger. </p>   
 <p class="c13"><a name="iii.XL-p68"></a>Knowing then all these things, let us shun the glory that comes from the multitude, and the pleasure that springs therefrom, that we may win the real and everlasting glory; unto which may we all attain, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and might, forever and ever. Amen.</p>
