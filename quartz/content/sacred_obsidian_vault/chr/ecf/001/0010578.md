 <p> <a name="viii.iv.cxvii"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="viii.iv.cxvii-p0.1"></a>Chapter CXVII.—Malachis prophecy concerning the sacrifices of the Christians. It cannot be taken as referring to the prayers of Jews of the dispersion.</h3>  
 <p><a name="viii.iv.cxvii-p1"></a>“Accordingly, God, anticipating all the sacrifices which we offer through this name, and which Jesus the Christ enjoined us to offer, i.e., in the Eucharist of the bread and the cup, and which are presented by Christians in all places throughout the world, bears witness that they are well-pleasing to Him. But He utterly rejects those presented by you and by those priests of yours, saying, And I will not accept your sacrifices at your hands; for from the rising of the sun to its setting my name is glorified among the Gentiles (He says); but ye profane it. <a name="fr_2388"></a><a href="#fn_2388"><font size="1">2389</font></a>
  <a name="viii.iv.cxvii-p2.2"></a>Yet even now, in your love of contention, you assert that God does not accept the sacrifices of those who dwelt then in Jerusalem, and were called Israelites; but says that He is pleased with the prayers of the individuals of that nation then dispersed, and calls their prayers sacrifices. Now, that prayers and giving of thanks, when offered by worthy men, are the only perfect and well-pleasing sacrifices to God, I also admit. For such alone Christians have undertaken to offer, and in the remembrance effected by their solid and liquid food, whereby the suffering of the Son of God <a name="fr_2389"></a><a href="#fn_2389"><font size="1">2390</font></a>
  which He endured is brought to mind, whose name the high priests of your nation and your teachers have caused to be profaned and blasphemed over all the earth. But these filthy garments, which have been put by you on all who have become Christians by the name of Jesus, God shows shall be taken away from us, when He shall raise all men from the dead, and appoint some to be incorruptible, immortal, and free from sorrow in the everlasting and imperishable kingdom; but shall send others away to the everlasting punishment of fire. But as to you and your teachers deceiving yourselves when you interpret what the Scripture says as referring to  <a name="page_258"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 258</font></a> <a name="viii.iv.cxvii-Page_258"></a>  those of your nation then in dispersion, and maintain that their prayers and sacrifices offered in every place are pure and well-pleasing, learn that you are speaking falsely, and trying by all means to cheat yourselves: for, first of all, not even now does your nation extend from the rising to the setting of the sun, but there are nations among which none of your race ever dwelt. For there is not one single race of men, whether barbarians, or Greeks, or whatever they may be called, nomads, or vagrants, or herdsmen living in tents, among whom prayers and giving of thanks are not offered through the name of the crucified Jesus. <a name="fr_2390"></a><a href="#fn_2390"><font size="1">2391</font></a>
  And then, <a name="fr_2391"></a><a href="#fn_2391"><font size="1">2392</font></a>
  as the Scriptures show, at the time when Malachi wrote this, your dispersion over all the earth, which now exists, had not taken place.</p>
