 <p><a name="viii.ii.xlii-p1"></a><a name="viii.ii.xlii-p1.1"></a>But when the Spirit of prophecy speaks of things that are about to come to pass as if they had already taken place, —as may be observed even in the passages already cited by me, —that  <a name="page_177"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 177</font></a> <a name="viii.ii.xlii-Page_177"></a>  this circumstance may afford no excuse to readers [for misinterpreting them], we will make even this also quite plain.
