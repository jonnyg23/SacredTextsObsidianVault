 <p><a name="v.ii.xx-p1"></a>If Jesus Christ shall graciously permit me through your prayers, and if it be His will, I shall, in a second little work which I will write to you, make further manifest to you [the nature of] the dispensation of which I have begun [to treat], with respect to the new man, Jesus Christ, in His faith and in His love, in His suffering and in His resurrection. Especially [will I do this <a name="fr_622"></a><a href="#fn_622"><font size="1">623</font></a>
