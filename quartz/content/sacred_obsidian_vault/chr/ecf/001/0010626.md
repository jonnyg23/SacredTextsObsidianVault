 <p> <a name="viii.vi.xvi"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="viii.vi.xvi-p0.1"></a>Chapter XVI.—Testimony of the Sibyl.</h3>  
 <p><a name="viii.vi.xvi-p1"></a><a name="viii.vi.xvi-p1.1"></a><a name="viii.vi.xvi-p1.2"></a>We must also mention what the ancient and exceedingly remote Sibyl, whom Plato and Aristophanes, and others besides, mention as a prophetess, taught you in her oracular verses concerning one only God. And she speaks thus:—</p>  <blockquote><a name="viii.vi.xvi-p1.3"></a>“There is one only unbegotten God,<br>  Omnipotent, invisible, most high,<br>  All-seeing, but Himself seen by no flesh.”<br> </blockquote>  
 <p><a name="viii.vi.xvi-p2"></a>Then elsewhere thus:—</p>  <blockquote><a name="viii.vi.xvi-p2.1"></a>“But we have strayed from the Immortals ways,<br>  And worship with a dull and senseless mind<br>  Idols, the workmanship of our own hands,<br>  And images and figures of dead men.”<br> </blockquote>  
 <p><a name="viii.vi.xvi-p3"></a>And again somewhere else:—</p>  <blockquote><a name="viii.vi.xvi-p3.1"></a>“Blessed shall be those men upon the earth<br>  Who shall love the great God before all else,<br>  Blessing Him when they eat and when they drink;<br>  Trusting it, this their piety alone.<br>  Who shall abjure all shrines which they may see,<br>  All altars and vain figures of dumb stones,<br>  Worthless and stained with blood of animals,<br>  And sacrifice of the four-fooled tribes,<br>  Beholding the great glory of One God.”<br> </blockquote>  
 <p><a name="viii.vi.xvi-p4"></a>These are the Sibyls words.</p>
