 <p> <a name="ix.ii.x"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="ix.ii.x-p0.1"></a>Chapter IX.—Refutation of the impious interpretations of these heretics.</h3>  
 <p><a name="ix.ii.x-p1"></a>1. <a name="ix.ii.x-p1.1"></a><a name="ix.ii.x-p1.2"></a>You see, my friend, the method which these men employ to deceive themselves, while they abuse the Scriptures by endeavouring to support their own system out of them. For this reason, I have brought forward their modes of expressing themselves, that thus thou mightest understand the deceitfulness of their procedure, and the wickedness of their error. For, in the first place, if it had been Johns intention to set forth that Ogdoad above, he would surely have preserved the order of its production, and would doubtless have placed the primary Tetrad first as being, according to them, most venerable and would then have annexed the second, that, by the sequence of the names, the order of the Ogdoad might be exhibited, and not after so long an interval, as if forgetful for the moment and then again calling the matter to mind, he, last of all, made mention of the primary Tetrad. In the next place, if he had meant to indicate their conjunctions, he certainly would not have omitted the name of Ecclesia; while, with respect to the other conjunctions, he either would have been satisfied with the mention of the male [Æons] (since the others [like Ecclesia] might be understood), so as to preserve a uniformity throughout; or if he enumerated the conjunctions of the rest, he would also have announced the spouse of Anthropos, and would not have left us to find out her name by divination.</p>  
 <p><a name="ix.ii.x-p2"></a>2. The fallacy, then, of this exposition is manifest. For when John, proclaiming one God, the Almighty, and one Jesus Christ, the Only-begotten, by whom all things were made, declares that this was the Son of God, this the Only-begotten, this the Former of all things, this the true Light who enlighteneth every man, this the Creator of the world, this He that came to His own, this He that became flesh and dwelt among us,—these men, by a plausible kind of exposition, perverting these statements, maintain that there was another Monogenes, according to production, whom they also style Arche. They also maintain that there was another Saviour, and another Logos, the son of Monogenes, and another Christ produced for the re-establishment of the Pleroma. Thus it is that, wresting from the truth every one of the expressions which have been cited, and taking a bad advantage of the names, they have transferred them to their own system; so that, according to them, in all these terms John makes no mention of the Lord Jesus Christ. For if he has named the Father, and Charis, and Monogenes, and Aletheia, and Logos, and Zoe, and Anthropos, and Ecclesia, according to their hypothesis, he has, by thus speaking, referred to the primary Ogdoad, in which there was as yet no Jesus, and no Christ, the teacher of John. But that the apostle did not speak concerning their conjunctions, but concerning our Lord Jesus Christ, whom he also acknowledges as the Word of God, he himself has made evident. For, summing up his statements respecting the Word previously mentioned by him, he further declares, “And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.” But, according to their hypothesis, the Word did not become flesh at all, inasmuch as He never went outside of the Pleroma, but that Saviour [became flesh] who was formed by a special dispensation [out of all the Æons], and was of later date than the Word.</p>  
 <p><a name="ix.ii.x-p3"></a>3. Learn then, ye foolish men, that Jesus who suffered for us, and who dwelt among us, is Himself the Word of God. For if any other of the Æons had become flesh for our salvation, it would have been probable that the apostle spoke of another. But if the Word of the Father who descended is the same also that ascended, He, namely, the Only-begotten Son of the only God, who, according to the good pleasure of the Father, became flesh for the sake of men, the apostle certainly does not speak regarding any other, or concerning any Ogdoad, but respecting our Lord Jesus Christ. For, according to them, the Word did not originally become flesh. For they maintain that the Saviour assumed an animal body, formed in accordance with a special dispensation by an unspeakable providence, so as to become visible and palpable. But <i>flesh</i> is that which was of old formed for Adam by God out of the dust, and it is this that John has declared the Word of God became. Thus is their primary and first-begotten Ogdoad brought to nought. For, since Logos, and Monogenes, and Zoe, and Phōs, and Soter, and Christus, and the Son of God, and He who became incarnate for us, have been proved to be one and the same, the Ogdoad which they have built up at once falls to pieces. And when this is destroyed,  <a name="page_330"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 330</font></a> <a name="ix.ii.x-Page_330"></a>  their whole system sinks into ruin,—a system which they falsely dream into existence, and thus inflict injury on the Scriptures, while they build up their own hypothesis.</p>  
 <p><a name="ix.ii.x-p4"></a>4. Then, again, collecting a set of expressions and names scattered here and there [in Scripture], they twist them, as we have already said, from a natural to a non-natural sense. <a name="ix.ii.x-p4.1"></a><a name="ix.ii.x-p4.2"></a>In so doing, they act like those who bring forward any kind of hypothesis they fancy, and then endeavour to support <a name="fr_2780"></a><a href="#fn_2780"><font size="1">2781</font></a>
  them out of the poems of Homer, so that the ignorant imagine that Homer actually composed the verses bearing upon that hypothesis, which has, in fact, been but newly constructed; and many others are led so far by the regularly-formed sequence of the verses, as to doubt whether Homer may not have composed them. Of this kind <a name="fr_2781"></a><a href="#fn_2781"><font size="1">2782</font></a>
  is the following passage, where one, describing Hercules as having been sent by Eurystheus to the dog in the infernal regions, does so by means of these Homeric verses,—for there can be no objection to our citing these by way of illustration, since the same sort of attempt appears in both:—</p>  
 <p><a name="ix.ii.x-p7"></a>“Thus saying, there sent forth from his house deeply groaning.”—<i>Od.</i>, x. 76.  “The hero Hercules conversant with mighty deeds.”—<i>Od.</i>, xxi. 26. “Eurystheus, the son of Sthenelus, descended from Perseus.”—<i>Il.</i>, xix. 123. “That he might bring from Erebus the dog of gloomy Pluto.”—<i>Il.</i>, viii. 368. “And he advanced like a mountain-bred lion confident of strength.”—<i>Od.</i>, vi. 130. “Rapidly through the city, while all his friends followed.” —<i>Il.</i>, xxiv. 327. “Both maidens, and youths, and much-enduring old men.”—<i>Od.</i>, xi. 38. “Mourning for him bitterly as one going forward to death.” —<i>Il.</i>, xxiv. 328. “But Mercury and the blue-eyed Minerva conducted him.”—<i>Od.</i>, xi. 626. “For she knew the mind of her brother, how it laboured with grief.”—<i>Il.</i>, ii. 409.</p>  
 <p><a name="ix.ii.x-p8"></a>Now, what simple-minded man, I ask, would not be led away by such verses as these to think that Homer actually framed them so with reference to the subject indicated? But he who is acquainted with the Homeric writings will recognise the verses indeed, but not the subject to which they are applied, as knowing that some of them were spoken of Ulysses, others of Hercules himself, others still of Priam, and others again of Menelaus and Agamemnon. But if he takes them and restores each of them to its proper position, he at once destroys the narrative in question. In like manner he also who retains unchangeable <a name="fr_2782"></a><a href="#fn_2782"><font size="1">2783</font></a>
  in his heart the rule of the truth which he received by means of baptism, will doubtless recognise the names, the expressions, and the parables taken from the Scriptures, but will by no means acknowledge the blasphemous use which these men make of them. For, though he will acknowledge the gems, he will certainly not receive the fox instead of the likeness of the king. But when he has restored every one of the expressions quoted to its proper position, and has fitted it to the body of the truth, he will lay bare, and prove to be without any foundation, the figment of these heretics.</p>  
 <p><a name="ix.ii.x-p10"></a>5. But since what may prove a finishing-stroke <a name="fr_2783"></a><a href="#fn_2783"><font size="1">2784</font></a>
  to this exhibition is wanting, so that any one, on following out their farce to the end, may then at once append an argument which shall overthrow it, we have judged it well to point out, first of all, in what respects the very fathers of this fable differ among themselves, as if they were inspired by different spirits of error. For this very fact forms an <i>a priori</i> proof that the truth proclaimed by the Church is immoveable, <a name="fr_2784"></a><a href="#fn_2784"><font size="1">2785</font></a>
  and that the theories of these men are but a tissue of falsehoods.</p>
