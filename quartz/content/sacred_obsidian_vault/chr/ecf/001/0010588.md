 <p> <a name="viii.iv.cxxvii"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="viii.iv.cxxvii-p0.1"></a>Chapter CXXVII.—These passages of Scripture do not apply to the Father, but to the Word.</h3>  
 <p><a name="viii.iv.cxxvii-p1"></a><a name="viii.iv.cxxvii-p1.1"></a><a name="viii.iv.cxxvii-p1.2"></a>“These and other such sayings are recorded by the lawgiver and by the prophets; and I suppose that I have stated sufficiently, that wherever <a name="fr_2447"></a><a href="#fn_2447"><font size="1">2448</font></a>
  God says, God went up from Abraham, <a name="fr_2448"></a><a href="#fn_2448"><font size="1">2449</font></a>
  or, The Lord spake to Moses, <a name="fr_2449"></a><a href="#fn_2449"><font size="1">2450</font></a>
  and The Lord came down to behold the tower which the sons of men had built, <a name="fr_2450"></a><a href="#fn_2450"><font size="1">2451</font></a>
  or when God shut Noah into the ark, <a name="fr_2451"></a><a href="#fn_2451"><font size="1">2452</font></a>
  you must not imagine that the unbegotten God Himself came down or went up from any place. For the ineffable Father and Lord of all neither has come to any place, nor walks, nor sleeps, nor rises up, but remains in His own place, wherever that is, quick to behold and quick to hear, having neither eyes nor ears, but being of indescribable might; and He sees all things, and knows all things, and none of us escapes His observation; and He is not moved or confined to a spot in the whole world, for He existed before the world was made. How, then, could He talk with any one, or be seen by any one, or appear on the smallest portion of the earth, when the people at Sinai were not able to look even on the glory of Him who was sent from Him; and Moses himself could not enter into the tabernacle which he had erected, when it was filled with the glory of God; and the priest could not endure to stand before the temple when Solomon conveyed the ark into the house in Jerusalem which he had built for it? Therefore neither Abraham, nor Isaac, nor Jacob, nor any other man, saw the Father and ineffable Lord of all, and also of Christ, but [saw] Him who was according to His will His Son, being God, and the Angel because He ministered to His will; whom also it pleased Him to be born man by the Virgin; who also was fire when He conversed with Moses from the bush. Since, unless we thus comprehend the Scriptures, it must follow that the Father and Lord of all had not been in heaven when what Moses wrote took place: And the Lord rained upon Sodom fire and brimstone from the Lord out of heaven; <a name="fr_2452"></a><a href="#fn_2452"><font size="1">2453</font></a>
  and again, when it is thus said by David: Lift up your gates, ye rulers; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting gates; and the King of glory shall enter; <a name="fr_2453"></a><a href="#fn_2453"><font size="1">2454</font></a>
  and again, when He says: The Lord says to my Lord, Sit at My right hand, till I make Thine enemies Thy footstool. <a name="fr_2454"></a><a href="#fn_2454"><font size="1">2455</font></a>
