 <p> <a name="viii.iv.cxxvi"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="viii.iv.cxxvi-p0.1"></a>Chapter CXXVI.—The various names of Christ according to both natures. It is shown that He is God, and appeared to the patriarchs.</h3>  
 <p><a name="viii.iv.cxxvi-p1"></a><a name="viii.iv.cxxvi-p1.1"></a><a name="viii.iv.cxxvi-p1.2"></a><a name="viii.iv.cxxvi-p1.3"></a><a name="viii.iv.cxxvi-p1.4"></a>“But if you knew, Trypho,” continued I, “who He is that is called at one time the Angel of great counsel, <a name="fr_2438"></a><a href="#fn_2438"><font size="1">2439</font></a>
  and a Man by Ezekiel, and like the Son of man by Daniel, and a Child by Isaiah, and Christ and God to be worshipped by David, and Christ and a Stone by many, and Wisdom by Solomon, and Joseph and Judah and a Star by Moses, and the East by Zechariah, and the Suffering One and Jacob and Israel by Isaiah again, and a Rod, and Flower, and Corner-Stone, and Son of God, you would not have blasphemed Him who has now come, and been  <a name="page_263"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 263</font></a> <a name="viii.iv.cxxvi-Page_263"></a>  born, and suffered, and ascended to heaven; who shall also come again, and then your twelve tribes shall mourn. For if you had understood what has been written by the prophets, you would not have denied that He was God, Son of the only, unbegotten, unutterable God. <a name="viii.iv.cxxvi-p2.1"></a>For Moses says somewhere in Exodus the following: The Lord spoke to Moses, and said to him, I am the Lord, and I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, being their God; and my name I revealed not to them, and I established my covenant with them. <a name="fr_2439"></a><a href="#fn_2439"><font size="1">2440</font></a>
  And thus again he says, A man wrestled with Jacob, <a name="fr_2440"></a><a href="#fn_2440"><font size="1">2441</font></a>
  and asserts it was God; narrating that Jacob said, I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved. And it is recorded that he called the place where He wrestled with him, appeared to and blessed him, the Face of God (Peniel). And Moses says that God appeared also to Abraham near the oak in Mamre, when he was sitting at the door of his tent at mid-day. Then he goes on to say: And he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, three men stood before him; and when he saw them, he ran to meet them. <a name="fr_2441"></a><a href="#fn_2441"><font size="1">2442</font></a>
  After a little, one of them promises a son to Abraham: Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, and I am old? Is anything impossible with God? At the time appointed I will return, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son. And they went away from Abraham. <a name="fr_2442"></a><a href="#fn_2442"><font size="1">2443</font></a>
  Again he speaks of them thus: And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom. <a name="fr_2443"></a><a href="#fn_2443"><font size="1">2444</font></a>
  Then to Abraham He who was and is again speaks: I will not hide from Abraham, my servant, what I intend to do. ” <a name="fr_2444"></a><a href="#fn_2444"><font size="1">2445</font></a>
  And what follows in the writings of Moses I quoted and explained; “from which I have demonstrated,” I said, “that He who is described as God appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, and the other patriarchs, was appointed under the authority of the Father and Lord, and ministers to His will.” Then I went on to say what I had not said before: “And so, when the people desired to eat flesh, and Moses had lost faith in Him, who also there is called the Angel, and who promised that God would give them to satiety, He who is both God and the Angel, sent by the Father, is described as saying and doing these things. For thus the Scripture says: And the Lord said to Moses, Will the Lords hand not be sufficient? thou shall know now whether my word shall conceal thee or not. <a name="fr_2445"></a><a href="#fn_2445"><font size="1">2446</font></a>
  And again, in other words, it thus says: But the Lord spoke unto me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan: the Lord thy God, who goeth before thy face, He shall cut off the nations. <a name="fr_2446"></a><a href="#fn_2446"><font size="1">2447</font></a>
