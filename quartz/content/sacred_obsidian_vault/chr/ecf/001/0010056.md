 <p><a name="ii.ii.li-p1"></a><a name="ii.ii.li-p1.1"></a><a name="ii.ii.li-p1.2"></a>Let us therefore implore forgiveness for all those transgressions which through any [suggestion] of the adversary we have committed. And those who have been the leaders of sedition and disagreement ought to have respect <a name="fr_227"></a><a href="#fn_227"><font size="1">228</font></a>
  to the common hope. For such as live in fear and love would rather that they themselves than their neighbours should be involved in suffering. And they prefer to bear blame themselves, rather than that the concord which has been well and piously <a name="fr_228"></a><a href="#fn_228"><font size="1">229</font></a>
  handed down to us should suffer. For it is better that a man should acknowledge his transgressions than that he should harden his heart, as the hearts of those were hardened who stirred up sedition against Moses the servant of God, and whose condemnation was made manifest [unto all]. For they went down alive into Hades, and death swallowed them up. <a name="fr_229"></a><a href="#fn_229"><font size="1">230</font></a>
  Pharaoh with his army and all the princes of Egypt, and the chariots with their riders, were sunk in the depths of the Red Sea, and perished, <a name="fr_230"></a><a href="#fn_230"><font size="1">231</font></a>
  for no other reason than that their foolish hearts were hardened, after so many signs and wonders had been wrought in the land of Egypt by Moses the servant of God.</p>
