 <p><a name="ii.ii.xi-p1"></a><a name="ii.ii.xi-p1.1"></a>On account of his hospitality and godliness, Lot was saved out of Sodom when all the country round was punished by means of fire and brimstone, the Lord thus making it manifest that He does not forsake those that hope in Him, but gives up such as depart from Him to punishment and torture. <a name="fr_49"></a><a href="#fn_49"><font size="1">50</font></a>
  For Lots wife, who went forth with him, being of a different mind from himself and not continuing in agreement with him [as to the command which had been given them], was made an example of, so as to be a pillar of salt unto this day. <a name="fr_50"></a><a href="#fn_50"><font size="1">51</font></a>
  This was done that all might know that those who are of a double mind, and who distrust the power of God, bring down judgment on themselves <a name="fr_51"></a><a href="#fn_51"><font size="1">52</font></a>
  and become a sign to all succeeding generations.</p>
