 <p><a name="viii.iv.xx-p1"></a><a name="viii.iv.xx-p1.1"></a><a name="viii.iv.xx-p1.2"></a>“Moreover, you were commanded to abstain from certain kinds of food, in order that you might keep God before your eyes while you ate and drank, seeing that you were prone and very ready to depart from His knowledge, as Moses also affirms: The people ate and drank, and rose up to play. <a name="fr_1993"></a><a href="#fn_1993"><font size="1">1994</font></a>
  And again: Jacob ate, and was satisfied, and waxed fat; and he who was beloved kicked: he waxed fat, he grew thick, he was enlarged, and he forsook God who had made him. <a name="fr_1994"></a><a href="#fn_1994"><font size="1">1995</font></a>
  For it was told you by Moses in the book of Genesis, that God granted to Noah, being a just man, to eat of every animal, but not of flesh with the blood, which is <i>dead</i>.” <a name="fr_1995"></a><a href="#fn_1995"><font size="1">1996</font></a>
  And as he was ready to say, “as the green herbs,” I anticipated him: “Why do you not receive this statement, as the green herbs, in the sense in which it was given by God, to wit, that just as God has granted the herbs for sustenance to man, even so has He given the animals for the diet of flesh? But, you say, a distinction was laid down thereafter to Noah, because we do not eat certain herbs. As you interpret it, the thing is incredible. And first I shall not occupy myself with this, though able to say and to hold that every vegetable is food, and fit to be eaten. But although we discriminate between green herbs, not eating all, we refrain from eating some, not because they are common or unclean, but because they are bitter, or deadly, or thorny. But we lay hands on and take of all herbs which are sweet, very nourishing and good, whether they are marine or land plants. Thus also God by the mouth of Moses commanded you to abstain from unclean and improper <a name="fr_1996"></a><a href="#fn_1996"><font size="1">1997</font></a>
  and violent animals: when, moreover, though you were eating manna in the desert, and were seeing all those wondrous acts wrought for you by God, you made and worshipped the golden calf. <a name="fr_1997"></a><a href="#fn_1997"><font size="1">1998</font></a>
  Hence he cries continually, and justly, They are foolish children, in whom is no faith. <a name="fr_1998"></a><a href="#fn_1998"><font size="1">1999</font></a>

As we abstain from some herbs, not because they are forbidden by law, but because they are deadly; so the law of abstinence from improper and violent animals was imposed not on Noah, but on you as a yoke on account of your sins.”—<span class="upper"><a name="viii.iv.xx-p6.1"></a>Maranus</span>.</p>
