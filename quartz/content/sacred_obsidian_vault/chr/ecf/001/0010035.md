 <p> <a name="ii.ii.xxx"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="ii.ii.xxx-p0.1"></a>Chapter XXX.—Let us do those things that please God, and flee from those He hates, that we may be blessed.</h3>  
 <p><a name="ii.ii.xxx-p1"></a><a name="ii.ii.xxx-p1.1"></a><a name="ii.ii.xxx-p1.2"></a><a name="ii.ii.xxx-p1.3"></a>Seeing, therefore, that we are the portion of the Holy One, let us do all those things which pertain to holiness, avoiding all evil-speaking, all abominable and impure embraces, together with all drunkenness, seeking after change, <a name="fr_120"></a><a href="#fn_120"><font size="1">121</font></a>
  all abominable lusts, detestable adultery, and execrable pride. <a name="ii.ii.xxx-p2.1"></a>“For God,” saith [the Scripture], “resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.” <a name="fr_121"></a><a href="#fn_121"><font size="1">122</font></a>
  Let us cleave, then, to those to whom grace has been given by God. Let us clothe ourselves with concord and humility, ever exercising self-control, standing far off from all whispering and evil-speaking, being justified by our works, and not our words. For [the Scripture] saith, “He that speaketh much, shall also hear much in answer. And does he that is ready in speech deem himself righteous? Blessed is he that is born of woman, who liveth but a short time: be not given to much speaking.” <a name="fr_122"></a><a href="#fn_122"><font size="1">123</font></a>
  Let our praise be in God, and not of ourselves; for God hateth those that commend themselves. Let testimony to our good deeds be borne by others, as it was in the case of our righteous forefathers. Boldness, and arrogance, and audacity belong to those that are accursed of God; but moderation, humility, and meekness to such as are blessed by Him.</p>
