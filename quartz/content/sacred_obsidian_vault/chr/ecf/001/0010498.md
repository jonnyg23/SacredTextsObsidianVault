 <p> <a name="viii.iv.xxxvii"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="viii.iv.xxxvii-p0.1"></a>Chapter XXXVII.—The same is proved from other Psalms.</h3>  
 <p><a name="viii.iv.xxxvii-p1"></a><a name="viii.iv.xxxvii-p1.1"></a><a name="viii.iv.xxxvii-p1.2"></a><a name="viii.iv.xxxvii-p1.3"></a>“Moreover, in the diapsalm of the forty-sixth Psalm, reference is thus made to Christ: God went up with a shout, the Lord with the sound of a trumpet. Sing ye to our God, sing ye: sing to our King, sing ye; for God is King of all the earth: sing with understanding. God has ruled over the nations. God sits upon His holy throne. The rulers of the nations were assembled along with the God of Abraham, for the strong ones of God are greatly exalted on the earth. <a name="fr_2040"></a><a href="#fn_2040"><font size="1">2041</font></a>
  And in the ninety-eighth Psalm, the Holy Spirit reproaches you, and predicts Him whom you do not wish to be king to be King and Lord, both of Samuel, and of Aaron, and of Moses, and, in short, of all the others. And the words of the Psalm are these: The Lord has reigned, let the nations be angry: [it is] He who sits upon the cherubim, let the earth be shaken. The Lord is great in Zion, and He is high above all the nations. Let them confess Thy great name, for it is fearful and holy, and the honour of the King loves judgment. Thou hast prepared equity; judgment and righteousness hast Thou performed in Jacob. Exalt the Lord our God, and worship the footstool of His feet; for He is holy. Moses and Aaron among His priests, and Samuel among those who call upon His name. They called (says the Scripture) on the Lord, and He heard them. In the pillar of the cloud He spake to them; for <a name="fr_2041"></a><a href="#fn_2041"><font size="1">2042</font></a>
  they kept His testimonies, and the commandment which he gave them. O Lord our God, Thou heardest them: O God, Thou wert propitious to them, and [yet] taking vengeance on all their inventions. Exalt the Lord our God, and worship at His holy hill; for the Lord our God is holy. ” <a name="fr_2042"></a><a href="#fn_2042"><font size="1">2043</font></a>
