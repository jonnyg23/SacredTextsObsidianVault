 <p><a name="viii.vi.viii-p1"></a><a name="viii.vi.viii-p1.1"></a><a name="viii.vi.viii-p1.2"></a>Since therefore it is impossible to learn anything true concerning religion from your teachers, who by their mutual disagreement have furnished you with sufficient proof of their own ignorance, I consider it reasonable to recur to our progenitors, who both in point of time have by a great way the precedence of your teachers, and who have taught us nothing from their own private fancy, nor differed with one another, nor attempted to overturn one anothers positions, but without wrangling and contention received from God the knowledge which also they taught to us. For neither by nature nor by human conception is it possible for men to know things so great and divine, but by the gift which then descended from above upon the holy men, who had no need of rhetorical art, <a name="fr_2530"></a><a href="#fn_2530"><font size="1">2531</font></a>
  nor of uttering anything in a contentious or quarrelsome manner, but to present themselves pure <a name="fr_2531"></a><a href="#fn_2531"><font size="1">2532</font></a>
  to the energy of the Divine Spirit, in order that the divine plectrum itself, descending from heaven, and using righteous men as an instrument like a harp or lyre, might reveal to us the knowledge of things divine and heavenly. Wherefore, as if with one mouth and one tongue, they have in succession, and in harmony with one another, taught us both concerning God, and the creation of the world, and the formation of man, and concerning the immortality of the human soul, and the judgment which is to be after this life, and concerning all things which it is needful for us to know, and thus in divers times and places have afforded us the divine instruction. <a name="fr_2532"></a><a href="#fn_2532"><font size="1">2533</font></a>
