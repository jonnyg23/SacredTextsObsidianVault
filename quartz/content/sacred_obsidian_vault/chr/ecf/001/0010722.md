 <p> <a name="ix.ii.xxvi"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="ix.ii.xxvi-p0.1"></a>Chapter XXV.—Doctrines of Carpocrates.</h3>  
 <p><a name="ix.ii.xxvi-p1"></a>1. <a name="ix.ii.xxvi-p1.1"></a>Carpocrates, again, and his followers maintain that the world and the things which are therein were created by angels greatly inferior to the unbegotten Father. They also hold that Jesus was the son of Joseph, and was just like other men, with the exception that he differed from them in this respect, that inasmuch as his soul was stedfast and pure, he perfectly remembered those things which he had witnessed <a name="fr_2944"></a><a href="#fn_2944"><font size="1">2945</font></a>
  within the sphere of the unbegotten God. On this account, a power descended upon him from the Father, that by means of it he might escape from the creators of the world; and they say that it, after passing through them all, and remaining in all points free, ascended again to him, and to the powers, <a name="fr_2945"></a><a href="#fn_2945"><font size="1">2946</font></a>
  which in the same way embraced like things to itself. They further declare, that the soul of Jesus, although educated in the practices of the Jews, regarded these with contempt, and that for this reason he was endowed with faculties, by means of which he destroyed those passions which dwelt in men as a punishment [for their sins].</p>  
 <p><a name="ix.ii.xxvi-p4"></a>2. The soul, therefore, which is like that of Christ can despise those rulers who were the creators of the world, and, in like manner, receives power for accomplishing the same results. This idea has raised them to such a pitch of pride, that some of them declare themselves similar to Jesus; while others, still more mighty, maintain that they are superior to his disciples, such as Peter and Paul, and the rest of the apostles, whom they consider to be in no respect inferior to Jesus. For their souls, descending from the same sphere as his, and therefore despising in like manner the creators of the world, are deemed worthy of the same power, and again depart to the same place. But if any one shall have despised the things in this world more than he did, he thus proves himself superior to him.</p>  
 <p><a name="ix.ii.xxvi-p5"></a>3. <a name="ix.ii.xxvi-p5.1"></a>They practise also magical arts and incantations; philters, also, and love-potions; and have recourse to familiar spirits, dream-sending demons, and other abominations, declaring that they possess power to rule over, even now, the princes and formers of this world; and not only them, but also all things that are in it. These men, even as the Gentiles, have been sent forth by Satan <a name="fr_2946"></a><a href="#fn_2946"><font size="1">2947</font></a>
  to bring dishonour upon the Church, so that, in one way or another, men hearing the things which they speak, and imagining that we all are such as they, may turn away their ears from the preaching of the truth; or, again, seeing the things they practise, may speak evil of  <a name="page_351"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 351</font></a> <a name="ix.ii.xxvi-Page_351"></a>  us all, who have in fact no fellowship with them, either in doctrine or in morals, or in our daily conduct. <a name="ix.ii.xxvi-p6.1"></a>But they lead a licentious life, <a name="fr_2947"></a><a href="#fn_2947"><font size="1">2948</font></a>
  and, to conceal their impious doctrines, they abuse the name [of Christ], as a means of hiding their wickedness; so that “their condemnation is just,” <a name="fr_2948"></a><a href="#fn_2948"><font size="1">2949</font></a>
  when they receive from God a recompense suited to their works.</p>  
 <p><a name="ix.ii.xxvi-p9"></a>4. <a name="ix.ii.xxvi-p9.1"></a>So unbridled is their madness, that they declare they have in their power all things which are irreligious and impious, and are at liberty to practise them; for they maintain that things are evil or good, simply in virtue of human opinion. <a name="fr_2949"></a><a href="#fn_2949"><font size="1">2950</font></a>
  They deem it necessary, therefore, that by means of transmigration from body to body, souls should have experience of every kind of life as well as every kind of action (unless, indeed, by a single incarnation, one may be able to prevent any need for others, by once for all, and with equal completeness, doing all those things which we dare not either speak or hear of, nay, which we must not even conceive in our thoughts, nor think credible, if any such thing is mooted among those persons who are our fellow-citizens), in order that, as their writings express it, their souls, having made trial of every kind of life, may, at their departure, not be wanting in any particular. It is necessary <a name="fr_2950"></a><a href="#fn_2950"><font size="1">2951</font></a>
  to insist upon this, lest, on account of some one thing being still wanting to their deliverance, they should be compelled once more to become incarnate. They affirm that for this reason Jesus spoke the following parable:—“Whilst thou art with thine adversary in the way, give all diligence, that thou mayest be delivered from him, lest he give thee up to the judge, and the judge surrender thee to the officer, and he cast thee into prison. Verily, I say unto thee, thou shalt not go out thence until thou pay the very last farthing.” <a name="fr_2951"></a><a href="#fn_2951"><font size="1">2952</font></a>
  <a name="ix.ii.xxvi-p12.3"></a><a name="ix.ii.xxvi-p12.4"></a>They also declare the “adversary” is one of those angels who are in the world, whom they call the Devil, maintaining that he was formed for this purpose, that he might lead those souls which have perished from the world to the Supreme Ruler. They describe him also as being chief among the makers of the world, and maintain that he delivers such souls [as have been mentioned] to another angel, who ministers to him, that he may shut them up in other bodies; for they declare that the body is “the prison.” Again, they interpret these expressions, “Thou shalt not go out thence until thou pay the very last farthing,” as meaning that no one can escape from the power of those angels who made the world, but that he must pass from body to body, until he has experience of every kind of action which can be practised in this world, and when nothing is longer wanting to him, then his liberated soul should soar upwards to that God who is above the angels, the makers of the world. In this way also all souls are saved, whether their own which, guarding against all delay, participate in all sorts of actions during one incarnation, or those, again, who, by passing from body to body, are set free, on fulfilling and accomplishing what is requisite in every form of life into which they are sent, so that at length they shall no longer be [shut up] in the body.</p>  
 <p><a name="ix.ii.xxvi-p13"></a>5. And thus, if ungodly, unlawful, and forbidden actions are committed among them, I can no longer find ground for believing them to be such. <a name="fr_2952"></a><a href="#fn_2952"><font size="1">2953</font></a>
  And in their writings we read as follows, the interpretation which they give [of their views], declaring that Jesus spoke in a mystery to His disciples and apostles privately, and that they requested and obtained permission to hand down the things thus taught them, to others who should be worthy and believing. We are saved, indeed, by means of faith and love; but all other things, while in their nature indifferent, are reckoned by the opinion of men—some good and some evil, there being nothing really evil by nature.</p>  
 <p><a name="ix.ii.xxvi-p15"></a>6. <a name="ix.ii.xxvi-p15.1"></a>Others of them employ outward marks, branding their disciples inside the lobe of the right ear. From among these also arose Marcellina, who came to Rome under [the episcopate of] Anicetus, and, holding these doctrines, she led multitudes astray. They style themselves Gnostics. They also possess images, some of them painted, and others formed from different kinds of material; while they maintain that a likeness of Christ was made by Pilate at that time when Jesus lived among them. <a name="fr_2953"></a><a href="#fn_2953"><font size="1">2954</font></a>
  They crown these images, and set them up along with the images of the philosophers of the world that is to say, with the images of Pythagoras, and Plato, and Aristotle, and the rest. They have also other modes of honouring these images, after the same manner of the Gentiles.</p>
