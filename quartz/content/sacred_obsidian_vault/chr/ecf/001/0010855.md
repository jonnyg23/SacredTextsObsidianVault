 <p> <a name="ix.vii.xviii"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="ix.vii.xviii-p0.1"></a>Chapter XVII.—There is but one Lord and one God, the Father and Creator of all things, who has loved us in Christ, given us commandments, and remitted our sins; whose Son and Word Christ proved Himself to be, when He forgave our sins.</h3>  
 <p><a name="ix.vii.xviii-p1"></a>1. <a name="ix.vii.xviii-p1.1"></a><a name="ix.vii.xviii-p1.2"></a>Now this being is the Creator (<i>Demiurgus</i>), who is, in respect of His love, the Father; but in respect of His power, He is Lord; and in respect of His wisdom, our Maker and Fashioner; by transgressing whose commandment we became His enemies. And therefore in the last times the Lord has restored us into friendship through His incarnation, having become “the Mediator between God and men;” <a name="fr_4589"></a><a href="#fn_4589"><font size="1">4590</font></a>
  propitiating indeed for us the Father against whom we had sinned, and cancelling (<i>consolatus</i>) our disobedience by His own obedience; conferring also upon us the gift of communion with, and subjection to, our Maker. <a name="ix.vii.xviii-p2.2"></a><a name="ix.vii.xviii-p2.3"></a>For this reason also He has taught us to say in prayer, “And forgive us our debts;” <a name="fr_4590"></a><a href="#fn_4590"><font size="1">4591</font></a>
  since indeed He is our Father, whose debtors we were, having transgressed His commandments. But who is this Being? Is He some unknown one, and a Father who gives no commandment  <a name="page_545"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 545</font></a> <a name="ix.vii.xviii-Page_545"></a>  to any one? Or is He the God who is proclaimed in the Scriptures, to whom we were debtors, having transgressed His commandment? Now the commandment was given to man by the Word. For Adam, it is said, “heard the voice of the <span class="upper"><a name="ix.vii.xviii-p3.2"></a>Lord</span> God.” <a name="fr_4591"></a><a href="#fn_4591"><font size="1">4592</font></a>
  Rightly then does His Word say to man, “Thy sins are forgiven thee;” <a name="fr_4592"></a><a href="#fn_4592"><font size="1">4593</font></a>
  He, the same against whom we had sinned in the beginning, grants forgiveness of sins in the end. But if indeed we had disobeyed the command of any other, while it was a different being who said, “Thy sins are forgiven thee;” <a name="fr_4593"></a><a href="#fn_4593"><font size="1">4594</font></a>
  such an one is neither good, nor true, nor just. For how can he be good, who does not give from what belongs to himself? Or how can he be just, who snatches away the goods of another? And in what way can sins be truly remitted, unless that He against whom we have sinned has Himself granted remission “through the bowels of mercy of our God,” in which “He has visited us” <a name="fr_4594"></a><a href="#fn_4594"><font size="1">4595</font></a>
  through His Son?</p>  
 <p><a name="ix.vii.xviii-p8"></a>2. And therefore, when He had healed the man sick of the palsy, [the evangelist] says “The people upon seeing it glorified God, who gave such power unto men.” <a name="fr_4595"></a><a href="#fn_4595"><font size="1">4596</font></a>
  What God, then, did the bystanders glorify? Was it indeed that unknown Father invented by the heretics? And how could they glorify him who was altogether unknown to them? It is evident, therefore, that the Israelites glorified Him who has been proclaimed as God by the law and the prophets, who is also the Father of our Lord; and therefore He taught men, by the evidence of their senses through those signs which He accomplished, to give glory to God. If, however, He Himself had come from another Father, and men glorified a different Father when they beheld His miracles, He [in that case] rendered them ungrateful to that Father who had sent the gift of healing. But as the only-begotten Son had come for mans salvation from Him who is God, He did both stir up the incredulous by the miracles which He was in the habit of working, to give glory to the Father; and to the Pharisees, who did not admit the advent of His Son, and who consequently did not believe in the remission [of sins] which was conferred by Him, He said, “That ye may know that the Son of man hath power to forgive sins.” <a name="fr_4596"></a><a href="#fn_4596"><font size="1">4597</font></a>
  And when He had said this, He commanded the paralytic man to take up the pallet upon which he was lying, and go into his house. By this work of His He confounded the unbelievers, and showed that He is Himself the voice of God, by which man received commandments, which he broke, and became a sinner; for the paralysis followed as a consequence of sins.</p>  
 <p><a name="ix.vii.xviii-p11"></a>3. Therefore, by remitting sins, He did indeed heal man, while He also manifested Himself who He was. For if no one can forgive sins but God alone, while the Lord remitted them and healed men, it is plain that He was Himself the Word of God made the Son of man, receiving from the Father the power of remission of sins; since He was man, and since He was God, in order that since as man He suffered for us, so as God He might have compassion on us, and forgive us our debts, in which we were made debtors to God our Creator. And therefore David said beforehand, “Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man to whom the <span class="upper"><a name="ix.vii.xviii-p11.1"></a>Lord</span> has not imputed sin;” <a name="fr_4597"></a><a href="#fn_4597"><font size="1">4598</font></a>
  pointing out thus that remission of sins which follows upon His advent, by which “He has destroyed the handwriting” of our debt, and “fastened it to the cross;” <a name="fr_4598"></a><a href="#fn_4598"><font size="1">4599</font></a>
  so that as by means of a tree we were made debtors to God, [so also] by means of a tree we may obtain the remission of our debt.</p>  
 <p><a name="ix.vii.xviii-p14"></a>4. <a name="ix.vii.xviii-p14.1"></a>This fact has been strikingly set forth by many others, and especially through means of Elisha the prophet. For when his fellow-prophets were hewing wood for the construction of a tabernacle, and when the iron [head], shaken loose from the axe, had fallen into the Jordan and could not be found by them, upon Elishas coming to the place, and learning what had happened, he threw some wood into the water. Then, when he had done this, the iron part of the axe floated up, and they took up from the surface of the water what they had previously lost. <a name="fr_4599"></a><a href="#fn_4599"><font size="1">4600</font></a>
  By this action the prophet pointed out that the sure word of God, which we had negligently lost by means of a tree, and were not in the way of finding again, we should receive anew by the dispensation of a tree, [viz., the cross of Christ]. For that the word of God is likened to an axe, John the Baptist declares [when he says] in reference to it, “But now also is the axe laid to the root of the trees.” <a name="fr_4600"></a><a href="#fn_4600"><font size="1">4601</font></a>
  Jeremiah also says to the same purport: “The word of God cleaveth the rock as an axe.” <a name="fr_4601"></a><a href="#fn_4601"><font size="1">4602</font></a>
  This word, then, what was hidden from us, did the dispensation of the tree make manifest, as I have already remarked. For as we lost it by means of a tree, by means of a tree again was it made manifest to all, showing the height, the length, the breadth, the depth in itself; and, as a certain man among our predecessors observed, “Through the extension of the hands of a divine person, <a name="fr_4602"></a><a href="#fn_4602"><font size="1">4603</font></a>
  gathering together the two peoples to one God.”  <a name="page_546"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 546</font></a> <a name="ix.vii.xviii-Page_546"></a>  For these were two hands, because there were two peoples scattered to the ends of the earth; but there was one head in the middle, as there is but one God, who is above all, and through all, and in us all.</p>
