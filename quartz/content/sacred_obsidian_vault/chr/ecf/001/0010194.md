 <p> <a name="v.vi.vii"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="v.vi.vii-p0.1"></a>Chapter VII.—I have exhorted you to unity.</h3>  
 <p><a name="v.vi.vii-p1"></a>For though some would have deceived me according to the flesh, yet the Spirit, as being from God, is not deceived. For it knows both whence it comes and whither it goes, <a name="fr_938"></a><a href="#fn_938"><font size="1">939</font></a>
  and detects the secrets [of the heart]. For, when I was among you, I cried, I spoke with a loud voice: Give heed to the bishop, and to the presbytery and deacons. Now, some suspected me of having spoken thus, as knowing beforehand the division caused by some among you. <a name="fr_939"></a><a href="#fn_939"><font size="1">940</font></a>
  But He is my witness, for whose sake I am in bonds, that I got no intelligence from any man. <a name="fr_940"></a><a href="#fn_940"><font size="1">941</font></a>
  But the Spirit proclaimed  <a name="page_84"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 84</font></a> <a name="v.vi.vii-Page_84"></a>  these words: Do nothing without the bishop; keep your bodies <a name="fr_941"></a><a href="#fn_941"><font size="1">942</font></a>
  as the temples of God; <a name="fr_942"></a><a href="#fn_942"><font size="1">943</font></a>
  love unity; avoid divisions; be the followers of Jesus Christ, even as He is of His Father.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.vi.vii-p7"></a>For though some would have deceived me according to the flesh, yet my spirit is not deceived; for I have received it from God. For it knows both whence it comes and whither it goes, and detects the secrets [of the heart]. For when I was among you, I cried, I spoke with a loud voice—the word is not mine, but Gods—Give heed to the bishop, and to the presbytery and deacons. But if ye suspect that I spake thus, as having learned beforehand the division caused by some among you, He is my witness, for whose sake I am in bonds, that I learned nothing of it from the mouth of any man. But the Spirit made an announcement to me, saying as follows: Do nothing without the bishop; keep your bodies <a name="fr_943"></a><a href="#fn_943"><font size="1">944</font></a>
  as the temples of God; love unity; avoid divisions; be ye followers of Paul, and of the rest of the apostles, even as they also were of Christ.</p>
