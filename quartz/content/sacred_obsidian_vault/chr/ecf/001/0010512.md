 <p> <a name="viii.iv.li"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="viii.iv.li-p0.1"></a>Chapter LI.—It is proved that this prophecy has been fulfilled.</h3>  
 <p><a name="viii.iv.li-p1"></a><a name="viii.iv.li-p1.1"></a>And when I ceased, Trypho said, “All the words of the prophecy you repeat, sir, are ambiguous,  <a name="page_221"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 221</font></a> <a name="viii.iv.li-Page_221"></a>  and have no force in proving what you wish to prove.” Then I answered, <a name="viii.iv.li-p1.2"></a>“If the prophets had not ceased, so that there were no more in your nation, Trypho, after this John, it is evident that what I say in reference to Jesus Christ might be regarded perhaps as ambiguous. But if John came first calling on men to repent, and Christ, while [John] still sat by the river Jordan, having come, put an end to his prophesying and baptizing, and preached also Himself, saying that the kingdom of heaven is at hand, and that He must suffer many things from the Scribes and Pharisees, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again, and would appear again in Jerusalem, and would again eat and drink with His disciples; and foretold that in the interval between His [first and second] advent, as I previously said, <a name="fr_2108"></a><a href="#fn_2108"><font size="1">2109</font></a>
  priests and false prophets would arise in His name, which things do actually appear; then how can they be ambiguous, when you may be persuaded by the facts? Moreover, He referred to the fact that there would be no longer in your nation any prophet, and to the fact that men recognised how that the New Testament, which God formerly announced [His intention of] promulgating, was then present, i.e., Christ Himself; and in the following terms: The law and the prophets were until John the Baptist; from that time the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force. And if you can <a name="fr_2109"></a><a href="#fn_2109"><font size="1">2110</font></a>
  receive it, he is Elijah, who was to come. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. <a name="fr_2110"></a><a href="#fn_2110"><font size="1">2111</font></a>
