 <p><a name="v.xvii.vii-p1"></a><a name="v.xvii.vii-p1.1"></a>And how, again, does Christ not at all appear to thee to be of the Virgin, but to be God over all, <a name="fr_1329"></a><a href="#fn_1329"><font size="1">1330</font></a>
  and the Almighty? Say, then, who sent Him? Who was Lord over Him? And whose will did He obey? And what laws did He fulfil, since He was subject neither to the will nor power of any one? And while you deny that Christ was born, <a name="fr_1330"></a><a href="#fn_1330"><font size="1">1331</font></a>
  you affirm that the unbegotten was begotten, and that He who had no beginning  <a name="page_118"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 118</font></a> <a name="v.xvii.vii-Page_118"></a>  was nailed to the cross, by whose permission I am unable to say. But thy changeable tactics do not escape me, nor am I ignorant that thou art wont to walk with slanting and uncertain <a name="fr_1331"></a><a href="#fn_1331"><font size="1">1332</font></a>
  steps. And thou art ignorant who really was born, thou who pretendest to know everything.</p>
