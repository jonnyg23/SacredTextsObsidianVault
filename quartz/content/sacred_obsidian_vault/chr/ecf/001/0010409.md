 <p><a name="viii.ii.xxxvi-p1"></a><a name="viii.ii.xxxvi-p1.1"></a>But when you hear the utterances of the prophets spoken as it were personally, you must not suppose that they are spoken by the inspired themselves, but by the Divine Word who moves them. For sometimes He declares things that are to come to pass, in the manner of one who foretells the future; sometimes He speaks as from the person of God the Lord and Father of all; sometimes as from the person of Christ; sometimes as from the person of the people answering the Lord or His Father, just as you can see even in your own writers, one man being the writer of the whole, but introducing the persons who converse. <a name="viii.ii.xxxvi-p1.2"></a><a name="viii.ii.xxxvi-p1.3"></a><a name="viii.ii.xxxvi-p1.4"></a><a name="viii.ii.xxxvi-p1.5"></a><a name="viii.ii.xxxvi-p1.6"></a>And this the Jews who possessed the books of the prophets did not understand, and therefore did not recognise Christ even when He came, but even hate us who say that He has come, and who prove that, as was predicted, He was crucified by them.</p>
