 <p> <a name="ii.ii.xxxviii"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="ii.ii.xxxviii-p0.1"></a>Chapter XXXVIII.—Let the members of the Church submit themselves, and no one exalt himself above another.</h3>  
 <p><a name="ii.ii.xxxviii-p1"></a><a name="ii.ii.xxxviii-p1.1"></a><a name="ii.ii.xxxviii-p1.2"></a><a name="ii.ii.xxxviii-p1.3"></a>Let our whole body, then, be preserved in, Christ Jesus; and let every one be subject to his neighbour, according to the special gift <a name="fr_165"></a><a href="#fn_165"><font size="1">166</font></a>
  bestowed upon him. Let the strong not despise the weak, and let the weak show respect unto the strong. Let the rich man provide for the wants of the poor; and let the poor man bless God, because He hath given him one by whom his need may be supplied. Let the wise man display his wisdom, not by [mere] words, but through good deeds. Let the humble not bear testimony to himself, but leave witness to be borne to him by another. <a name="fr_166"></a><a href="#fn_166"><font size="1">167</font></a>
  Let him that is pure in the flesh not grow proud <a name="fr_167"></a><a href="#fn_167"><font size="1">168</font></a>
  of it, and boast, knowing that it was another who bestowed on him the gift of continence. Let us consider, then, brethren, of what matter we were made,—who and what manner of beings we came into the world, as it were out of a sepulchre, and from utter darkness. <a name="fr_168"></a><a href="#fn_168"><font size="1">169</font></a>
  He who made us and fashioned us, having prepared His bountiful gifts for us before we were born, introduced us into His world. <a name="ii.ii.xxxviii-p5.2"></a>Since, therefore, we receive all these things from Him, we ought for everything to give Him thanks; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
