 <p><a name="vii.ii.iv-p2"></a><a name="vii.ii.iv-p2.1"></a><a name="vii.ii.iv-p2.2"></a>As the elders who saw John the disciple of the Lord remembered that they had heard from him how the Lord taught in regard to those times, and said]: “The days will come in which vines shall grow, having each ten thousand branches, and in each branch ten thousand twigs, and in each true twig ten thousand shoots, and in every one of the shoots ten thousand clusters, and on every one of the clusters ten thousand grapes, and every grape when pressed will give five-and-twenty metretes of wine. And when any one of the saints shall lay hold of a cluster, another shall cry out, I am a better cluster, take me; bless the Lord through me. In like manner, [He said] that a grain of wheat would  <a name="page_154"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 154</font></a> <a name="vii.ii.iv-Page_154"></a>  produce ten thousand ears, and that every ear would have ten thousand grains, and every grain would yield ten pounds of clear, pure, fine flour; and that apples, and seeds, and grass would produce in similar proportions; and that all animals, feeding then only on the productions of the earth, would become peaceable and harmonious, and be in perfect subjection to man.” <a name="fr_1745"></a><a href="#fn_1745"><font size="1">1746</font></a>
  [Testimony is borne to these things in writing by Papias, an ancient man, who was a hearer of John and a friend of Polycarp, in the fourth of his books; for five books were composed by him. And he added, saying, “Now these things are credible to believers. <a name="vii.ii.iv-p3.1"></a>And Judas the traitor,” says he, “not believing, and asking, How shall such growths be accomplished by the Lord? the Lord said, They shall see who shall come to them. These, then, are the times mentioned by the prophet Isaiah: And the wolf shall lie, down with the lamb, etc. (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#006">Isa. xi. 6</a><a name="vii.ii.iv-p3.2"></a> ff.).”]</p>
