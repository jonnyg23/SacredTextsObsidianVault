 <p> <a name="viii.ii.xxii"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="viii.ii.xxii-p0.1"></a>Chapter XXII.—Analogies to the sonship of Christ.</h3>  
 <p><a name="viii.ii.xxii-p1"></a><a name="viii.ii.xxii-p1.1"></a><a name="viii.ii.xxii-p1.2"></a><a name="viii.ii.xxii-p1.3"></a>Moreover, the Son of God called Jesus, even if only a man by ordinary generation, yet, on account of His wisdom, is worthy to be called the Son of God; for all writers call God the Father of men and gods. And if we assert that the Word of God was born of God in a peculiar manner, different from ordinary generation, let this, as said above, be no extraordinary thing to you, who say that Mercury is the angelic word of God. <a name="viii.ii.xxii-p1.4"></a>But if any one objects that He was crucified, in this also He is on a par with those reputed sons of Jupiter of yours, who suffered as we have now enumerated. For their sufferings at death are recorded to have been not all alike, but diverse; so that not even by the peculiarity of His sufferings does He seem to be inferior to them; but, on the contrary, as we promised in the preceding part of this discourse, we will now prove Him superior— or rather have already proved Him to be so—for the superior is revealed by His actions. And if we even affirm that He was born of a virgin, accept this in common with what you accept of Perseus. And in that we say that He made whole the lame, the paralytic, and those born blind, we seem to say what is very similar to the deeds said to have been done by Æsculapius.</p>
