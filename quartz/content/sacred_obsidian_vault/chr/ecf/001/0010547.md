 <p> <a name="viii.iv.lxxxvi"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="viii.iv.lxxxvi-p0.1"></a>Chapter LXXXVI.—There are various figures in the Old Testament of the wood of the cross by which Christ reigned.</h3>  
 <p><a name="viii.iv.lxxxvi-p1"></a><a name="viii.iv.lxxxvi-p1.1"></a><a name="viii.iv.lxxxvi-p1.2"></a><a name="viii.iv.lxxxvi-p1.3"></a><a name="viii.iv.lxxxvi-p1.4"></a>And when I had quoted this, I added, “Hear, then, how this Man, of whom the Scriptures declare that He will come again in glory after His crucifixion, was symbolized both by the tree of life, which was said to have been planted in paradise, and by those events which should happen to all the just. Moses was sent with a rod to effect the redemption of the people; and with this in his hands at the head of the people, he divided the sea. By this he saw the water gushing out of the rock; and when he cast a tree into the waters of Marah, which were bitter, he made them sweet. Jacob, by putting rods into the water-troughs, caused the sheep of his uncle to conceive, so that he should obtain their young. With his rod the same Jacob boasts that he had crossed the river. He said he had seen a ladder, and the Scripture has declared that God stood above it. But that this was not the Father, we have proved from the Scriptures. And Jacob, having poured oil on a stone in the same place, is testified to by the very God who appeared to him, that he had anointed a pillar to the God who appeared to him. And that the stone symbolically proclaimed Christ, we have also proved by many Scriptures; and that the unguent, whether it was of oil, or of <i>stacte</i>, <a name="fr_2285"></a><a href="#fn_2285"><font size="1">2286</font></a>
  or of any other compounded sweet balsams, had reference to Him, we have also proved, <a name="fr_2286"></a><a href="#fn_2286"><font size="1">2287</font></a>
  inasmuch as the word says: Therefore God, even Thy God, hath anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above Thy fellows. <a name="fr_2287"></a><a href="#fn_2287"><font size="1">2288</font></a>
  For indeed all kings and anointed persons obtained from Him their share in the names of kings and anointed: just as He Himself received from the Father the titles of King, and Christ, and Priest, and Angel, and such like other titles which He bears or did bear. Aarons rod, which blossomed, declared him to be the high priest. Isaiah prophesied that a rod would come forth from the root of Jesse, [and this was] Christ. And David says that the righteous man is like the tree that is planted by the channels of waters, which should yield its fruit in its season, and whose leaf should not fade. <a name="fr_2288"></a><a href="#fn_2288"><font size="1">2289</font></a>
  Again, the righteous is said to flourish like the palm-tree. God appeared from a tree to Abraham, as it is written, near the oak in Mamre. The people found seventy willows and twelve springs after crossing the Jordan. <a name="fr_2289"></a><a href="#fn_2289"><font size="1">2290</font></a>
  David affirms that God comforted him with a rod and staff. Elisha, by casting a stick <a name="fr_2290"></a><a href="#fn_2290"><font size="1">2291</font></a>
  into the river Jordan, recovered the iron part of the axe with which the sons of the prophets had gone to cut down trees to build the house in which they wished to read and study the law and commandments of God; even as our Christ, by being crucified on the tree, and by purifying [us] with water, has redeemed us, though plunged in the direst offences which we have committed, and has made [us] a house of prayer and adoration. Moreover, it was a rod that pointed out Judah to be the father of Tamars sons by a great mystery.”</p>
