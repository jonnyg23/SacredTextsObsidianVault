 <p> <a name="viii.iv.xcvi"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="viii.iv.xcvi-p0.1"></a>Chapter XCVI.—That curse was a prediction of the things which the Jews would do.</h3>  
 <p><a name="viii.iv.xcvi-p1"></a><a name="viii.iv.xcvi-p1.1"></a><a name="viii.iv.xcvi-p1.2"></a><a name="viii.iv.xcvi-p1.3"></a>“For the statement in the law, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree, <a name="fr_2315"></a><a href="#fn_2315"><font size="1">2316</font></a>
  confirms our hope which depends on the crucified Christ, not because He who has been crucified is cursed by God, but because God foretold that which would be done by you all, and by those like to you, who do not know <a name="fr_2316"></a><a href="#fn_2316"><font size="1">2317</font></a>
  that this is He who existed before all, who is the eternal Priest of God, and King, and Christ. And you clearly see that this has come to pass. <a name="viii.iv.xcvi-p3.3"></a><a name="viii.iv.xcvi-p3.4"></a>For you curse in your synagogues all those who are called <a name="fr_2317"></a><a href="#fn_2317"><font size="1">2318</font></a>
  from Him Christians; and other nations effectively carry out the curse, putting to death those who simply confess themselves to be Christians; to all of whom we say, You are our brethren; rather recognise the truth of God. And while neither they nor you are persuaded by us, but strive earnestly to cause us to deny the name of Christ, we choose rather and submit to death, in the full assurance that all the good which God has promised through Christ He will reward us with. And in addition to all this we pray for you, that Christ may have mercy upon you. For He taught us to pray for our enemies also, saying, Love your enemies; be kind and merciful, as your heavenly Father is. <a name="fr_2318"></a><a href="#fn_2318"><font size="1">2319</font></a>
  For we see that the Almighty God is kind and merciful, causing His sun to rise on the unthankful and on the righteous, and sending rain on the holy and on the wicked; all of whom He has taught us He will judge.</p>
