 <p> <a name="ix.vii.xvi"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="ix.vii.xvi-p0.1"></a>Chapter XV.—Proofs of the resurrection from Isaiah and Ezekiel; the same God who created us will also raise us up.</h3>  
 <p><a name="ix.vii.xvi-p1"></a>1. <a name="ix.vii.xvi-p1.1"></a>Now, that He who at the beginning created man, did promise him a second birth after his dissolution into earth, Esaias thus declares: “The dead shall rise again, and they who are in the tombs shall arise, and they who are in the earth shall rejoice. For the dew which is from Thee is health to them.” <a name="fr_4574"></a><a href="#fn_4574"><font size="1">4575</font></a>
  And again: “I will comfort you, and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem: and ye shall see, and your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish as the grass; and the hand of the Lord shall be known to those who worship Him.” <a name="fr_4575"></a><a href="#fn_4575"><font size="1">4576</font></a>
  And Ezekiel speaks as follows: “And the hand of the <span class="upper"><a name="ix.vii.xvi-p3.2"></a>Lord</span> came upon me, and the <span class="upper"><a name="ix.vii.xvi-p3.3"></a>Lord</span> led me forth in the Spirit, and set me down in the midst of the plain, and this place was full of bones. And He caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there were many upon the surface of the plain very dry. And He said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I said, Lord, Thou who hast made them dost know. And He said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and thou shalt say to them, Ye dry bones, hear the word of the <span class="upper"><a name="ix.vii.xvi-p3.4"></a>Lord</span>. Thus saith the <span class="upper"><a name="ix.vii.xvi-p3.5"></a>Lord</span> to these bones, Behold, I will cause the spirit of life to come upon you, and I will lay sinews upon you, and bring up flesh again upon you, and I will stretch skin upon you, and will put my Spirit into you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am the <span class="upper"><a name="ix.vii.xvi-p3.6"></a>Lord</span>. And I prophesied as the Lord had commanded me. And it came to pass, when I was prophesying, that, behold, an earthquake, and the bones were drawn together, each one to its own articulation: and I beheld, and, lo, the sinews and flesh were produced upon them, and the skins rose upon them round about, but there was no breath in them. And He said unto me, Prophesy to the breath, son of man, and say to the breath, These things saith the <span class="upper"><a name="ix.vii.xvi-p3.7"></a>Lord</span>, Come from the four winds (<i>spiritibus</i>), and breathe upon these dead, that they may live. So I prophesied as the Lord had commanded me, and the breath entered into them; and they did live, and stood upon their feet, an exceeding great gathering.” <a name="fr_4576"></a><a href="#fn_4576"><font size="1">4577</font></a>
  And again he says, “Thus saith the <span class="upper"><a name="ix.vii.xvi-p4.2"></a>Lord</span>, Behold, I will set your graves open, and cause you to come out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel; and ye shall know that I am the <span class="upper"><a name="ix.vii.xvi-p4.3"></a>Lord</span>,  <a name="page_543"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 543</font></a> <a name="ix.vii.xvi-Page_543"></a>  when I shall open your sepulchres, that I may bring my people again out of the sepulchres: and I will put my Spirit into you, and ye shall live; and I will place you in your land, and ye shall know that I am the <span class="upper"><a name="ix.vii.xvi-p4.4"></a>Lord</span>. I have said, and I will do, saith the <span class="upper"><a name="ix.vii.xvi-p4.5"></a>Lord</span>.” <a name="fr_4577"></a><a href="#fn_4577"><font size="1">4578</font></a>
  As we at once perceive that the Creator (<i>Demiurgo</i>) is in this passage represented as vivifying our dead bodies, and promising resurrection to them, and resuscitation from their sepulchres and tombs, conferring upon them immortality also (He says, “For as the tree of life, so shall their days be” <a name="fr_4578"></a><a href="#fn_4578"><font size="1">4579</font></a>
 ), He is shown to be the only God who accomplishes these things, and as Himself the good Father, benevolently conferring life upon those who have not life from themselves.</p>  
 <p><a name="ix.vii.xvi-p7"></a>2. And for this reason did the Lord most plainly manifest Himself and the Father to His disciples, lest, forsooth, they might seek after another God besides Him who formed man, and who gave him the breath of life; and that men might not rise to such a pitch of madness as to feign another Father above the Creator. And thus also He healed by a word all the others who were in a weakly condition because of sin; to whom also He said, “Behold, thou art made whole, sin no more, lest a worse thing come upon thee:” <a name="fr_4579"></a><a href="#fn_4579"><font size="1">4580</font></a>
  pointing out by this, that, because of the sin of disobedience, infirmities have come upon men. To that man, however, who had been blind from his birth, He gave sight, not by means of a word, but by an outward action; doing this not without a purpose, or because it so happened, but that He might show forth the hand of God, that which at the beginning had moulded man. And therefore, when His disciples asked Him for what cause the man had been born blind, whether for his own or his parents fault, He replied, “Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents, but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.” <a name="fr_4580"></a><a href="#fn_4580"><font size="1">4581</font></a>
  Now the work of God is the fashioning of man. For, as the Scripture says, He made [man] by a kind of process: “And the Lord took clay from the earth, and formed man.” <a name="fr_4581"></a><a href="#fn_4581"><font size="1">4582</font></a>
  Wherefore also the Lord spat on the ground and made clay, and smeared it upon the eyes, pointing out the original fashioning [of man], how it was effected, and manifesting the hand of God to those who can understand by what [hand] man was formed out of the dust. For that which the artificer, the Word, had omitted to form in the womb, [viz., the blind mans eyes], He then supplied in public, that the works of God might be manifested in him, in order that we might not be seeking out another hand by which man was fashioned, nor another Father; knowing that this hand of God which formed us at the beginning, and which does form us in the womb, has in the last times sought us out who were lost, winning back His own, and taking up the lost sheep upon His shoulders, and with joy restoring it to the fold of life.</p>  
 <p><a name="ix.vii.xvi-p11"></a>3. Now, that the Word of God forms us in the womb, He says to Jeremiah, “Before I formed thee in the womb, I knew thee; and before thou wentest forth from the belly, I sanctified thee, and appointed thee a prophet among the nations.” <a name="fr_4582"></a><a href="#fn_4582"><font size="1">4583</font></a>
  And Paul, too, says in like manner, “But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mothers womb, that I might declare Him among the nations.” <a name="fr_4583"></a><a href="#fn_4583"><font size="1">4584</font></a>
  As, therefore, we are by the Word formed in the womb, this very same Word formed the visual power in him who had been blind from his birth; showing openly who it is that fashions us in secret, since the Word Himself had been made manifest to men: and declaring the original formation of Adam, and the manner in which he was created, and by what hand he was fashioned, indicating the whole from a part. For the Lord who formed the visual powers is He who made the whole man, carrying out the will of the Father. And inasmuch as man, with respect to that formation which, was after Adam, having fallen into transgression, needed the laver of regeneration, [the Lord] said to him [upon whom He had conferred sight], after He had smeared his eyes with the clay, “Go to Siloam, and wash;” <a name="fr_4584"></a><a href="#fn_4584"><font size="1">4585</font></a>
  thus restoring to him both [his perfect] confirmation, and that regeneration which takes place by means of the laver. And for this reason when he was washed he came seeing, that he might both know Him who had fashioned him, and that man might learn [to know] Him who has conferred upon him life.</p>  
 <p><a name="ix.vii.xvi-p15"></a>4. All the followers of Valentinus, therefore, lose their case, when they say that man was not fashioned out of this earth, but from a fluid and diffused substance. For, from the earth out of which the Lord formed eyes for that man, from the same earth it is evident that man was also fashioned at the beginning. For it were incompatible that the eyes should indeed be formed from one source and the rest of the body from another; as neither would it be compatible that one [being] fashioned the body, and another the eyes. But He, the very same who formed Adam at the beginning, with whom also the Father spake, [saying], “Let Us make man after Our image and likeness,” <a name="fr_4585"></a><a href="#fn_4585"><font size="1">4586</font></a>
  revealing Himself in these last times to men, formed visual organs (<i>visionem</i>) for him who had been blind [in  <a name="page_544"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 544</font></a> <a name="ix.vii.xvi-Page_544"></a>  that body which he had derived] from Adam. Wherefore also the Scripture, pointing out what should come to pass, says, that when Adam had hid himself because of his disobedience, the Lord came to him at eventide, called him forth, and said, “Where art thou?” <a name="fr_4586"></a><a href="#fn_4586"><font size="1">4587</font></a>
  That means that in the last times the very same Word of God came to call man, reminding him of his doings, living in which he had been hidden from the Lord. For just as at that time God spake to Adam at eventide, searching him out; so in the last times, by means of the same voice, searching out his posterity, He has visited them.</p>
