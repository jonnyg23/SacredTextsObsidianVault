 <p> <a name="v.iv.iii"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="v.iv.iii-p0.1"></a>Chapter III.—Honour the deacons, etc.</h3>  
 <p><a name="v.iv.iii-p1"></a>In like manner, let all reverence the deacons as an appointment <a name="fr_736"></a><a href="#fn_736"><font size="1">737</font></a>
  of Jesus Christ, and the bishop as Jesus Christ, who is the Son of the Father, and the presbyters as the sanhedrim of God, and assembly of the apostles. Apart from these, there is no Church. <a name="fr_737"></a><a href="#fn_737"><font size="1">738</font></a>
  Concerning all this, I am persuaded that ye are of the same opinion. For I have received the manifestation <a name="fr_738"></a><a href="#fn_738"><font size="1">739</font></a>
  of your love, and still have it with me, in your bishop, whose very appearance is highly instructive, <a name="fr_739"></a><a href="#fn_739"><font size="1">740</font></a>
  and his meekness of itself a power; whom I imagine even the ungodly must reverence, seeing they are <a name="fr_740"></a><a href="#fn_740"><font size="1">741</font></a>
  also pleased that I do not spare myself. But shall I, when permitted to write on this point, reach such a height of self-esteem, that though being a condemned <a name="fr_741"></a><a href="#fn_741"><font size="1">742</font></a>
  man, I should issue commands to you as if I were an apostle?</p>  
 <p><a name="v.iv.iii-p8"></a>And do ye reverence them as Christ Jesus, of whose place they are the keepers, even as the bishop is the representative of the Father of all things, and the presbyters are the sanhedrim of God, and assembly <a name="fr_742"></a><a href="#fn_742"><font size="1">743</font></a>
  of the apostles of Christ. Apart from these there is no elect Church, no congregation of holy ones, no assembly of saints. I am persuaded that ye also are of this opinion. For I have received the manifestation <a name="fr_743"></a><a href="#fn_743"><font size="1">744</font></a>
  of your love, and still have it with me, in your bishop, whose very appearance is highly instructive, and his meekness of itself a power; whom I imagine even the ungodly must reverence. Loving you as I do, I avoid writing in any severer strain to you, that I may not seem harsh to any, or wanting [in tenderness]. I am indeed bound for the sake of Christ, but I am not yet worthy of Christ. But when I am perfected, perhaps I shall then become so. I do not issue orders like an apostle.</p>
