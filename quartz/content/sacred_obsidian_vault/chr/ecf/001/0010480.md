 <p> <a name="viii.iv.xix"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="viii.iv.xix-p0.1"></a>Chapter XIX.—Circumcision unknown before Abraham. The law was given by Moses on account of the hardness of their hearts.</h3>  
 <p><a name="viii.iv.xix-p1"></a>“It is this about which we are at a loss, and with reason, because, while you endure such things, you do not observe all the other customs which we are now discussing.”</p>  
 <p><a name="viii.iv.xix-p2"></a><a name="viii.iv.xix-p2.1"></a><a name="viii.iv.xix-p2.2"></a>“This circumcision is not, however, necessary for all men, but for you alone, in order that, as I have already said, you may suffer these things which you now justly suffer. Nor do we receive that useless baptism of cisterns, for it has nothing to do with this baptism of life. Wherefore also God has announced that you have forsaken Him, the living fountain, and digged for yourselves broken cisterns which can hold no water. Even you, who are the circumcised according to the flesh, have need of our circumcision; but we, having the latter, do not require the former. For if it were necessary, as you suppose, God  <a name="page_204"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 204</font></a> <a name="viii.iv.xix-Page_204"></a>  would not have made Adam uncircumcised; would not have had respect to the gifts of Abel when, being uncircumcised, he offered sacrifice and would not have been pleased with the uncircumcision of Enoch, who was not found, because God had translated him. Lot, being uncircumcised, was saved from Sodom, the angels themselves and the Lord sending him out. Noah was the beginning of our race; yet, uncircumcised, along with his children he went into the ark. Melchizedek, the priest of the Most High, was uncircumcised; to whom also Abraham the first who received circumcision after the flesh, gave tithes, and he blessed him: after whose order God declared, by the mouth of David, that He would establish the everlasting priest. Therefore to you alone this circumcision was necessary, in order that the people may be no people, and the nation no nation; as also Hosea, <a name="fr_1990"></a><a href="#fn_1990"><font size="1">1991</font></a>
  one of the twelve prophets, declares. Moreover, all those righteous men already mentioned, though they kept no Sabbaths, <a name="fr_1991"></a><a href="#fn_1991"><font size="1">1992</font></a>
  were pleasing to God; and after them Abraham with all his descendants until Moses, under whom your nation appeared unrighteous and ungrateful to God, making a calf in the wilderness: wherefore God, accommodating Himself to that nation, enjoined them also to offer sacrifices, as if to His name, in order that you might not serve idols. Which precept, however, you have not observed; nay, you sacrificed your children to demons. And you were commanded to keep Sabbaths, that you might retain the memorial of God. For His word makes this announcement, saying, That ye may know that I am God who redeemed you. <a name="fr_1992"></a><a href="#fn_1992"><font size="1">1993</font></a>
