 <p><a name="v.xxv.iii-p1"></a><a name="v.xxv.iii-p1.1"></a>Wherefore, with great alacrity and joy, through his desire to suffer, he came down from Antioch to Seleucia, from which place he set sail. And after a great deal of suffering he came to Smyrna, where he disembarked with great joy, and hastened to see the holy Polycarp, [formerly] his fellow-disciple, and [now] bishop of Smyrna. For they had both, in old times, been disciples of St. John the Apostle. Being then brought to him, and having communicated to him some spiritual gifts, and glorying in his bonds, he entreated of him to labour <a name="fr_1414"></a><a href="#fn_1414"><font size="1">1415</font></a>
  along with him for the fulfilment of his desire; earnestly indeed asking this of the whole Church (for the cities and Churches of Asia had welcomed <a name="fr_1415"></a><a href="#fn_1415"><font size="1">1416</font></a>
  the holy man through their bishops, and presbyters, and deacons, all hastening to meet him, if by any means they might receive from him some <a name="fr_1416"></a><a href="#fn_1416"><font size="1">1417</font></a>
  spiritual gift), but above all, the holy Polycarp, that, by means of the wild beasts, he soon disappearing from this world, might be manifested before the face of Christ.</p>
