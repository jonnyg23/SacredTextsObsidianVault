 <p> <a name="ix.iv.xxii"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="ix.iv.xxii-p0.1"></a>Chapter XXI.—A vindication of the prophecy in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014">Isa. vii. 14</a><a name="ix.iv.xxii-p0.2"></a> against the misinterpretations of Theodotion, Aquila, the Ebionites, and the Jews. Authority of the Septuagint version. Arguments in proof that Christ was born of a virgin.</h3>  
 <p><a name="ix.iv.xxii-p1"></a>1. <a name="ix.iv.xxii-p1.1"></a><a name="ix.iv.xxii-p1.2"></a><a name="ix.iv.xxii-p1.3"></a><a name="ix.iv.xxii-p1.4"></a>God, then, was made man, and the Lord did Himself save us, giving us the token of the Virgin. But not as some allege, among those now presuming to expound the Scripture, [thus:] “Behold, a young woman shall conceive, and bring forth a son,” <a name="fr_3707"></a><a href="#fn_3707"><font size="1">3708</font></a>
  as Theodotion the Ephesian has interpreted, and Aquila of Pontus, <a name="fr_3708"></a><a href="#fn_3708"><font size="1">3709</font></a>
  both Jewish proselytes. The Ebionites, following these, assert that He was begotten by Joseph; thus destroying, as far as in them lies, such a marvellous dispensation of God, and setting aside the testimony of the prophets which proceeded from God. For truly this prediction was uttered before the removal of the people to Babylon; that is, anterior to the supremacy acquired by the Medes and Persians. But it was interpreted into Greek by the Jews themselves, much before the period of our Lords advent, that there might remain no suspicion that perchance the Jews, complying with our humour, did put this interpretation upon these words. They indeed, had they been cognizant of our future existence, and that we should use these proofs from the Scriptures, would themselves never have hesitated to burn their own Scriptures, which do declare that all other nations partake of [eternal] life, and show that they who boast themselves as being the house of Jacob and the people of Israel, are disinherited from the grace of God.</p>  
 <p><a name="ix.iv.xxii-p4"></a>2. <a name="ix.iv.xxii-p4.1"></a><a name="ix.iv.xxii-p4.2"></a>For before the Romans possessed their kingdom, <a name="fr_3709"></a><a href="#fn_3709"><font size="1">3710</font></a>
  while as yet the Macedonians held Asia, Ptolemy the son of Lagus, being anxious to adorn the library which he had founded in Alexandria, with a collection of the writings of all men, which were [works] of merit, made request to the people of Jerusalem, that they should have their Scriptures translated into the Greek language. <a name="ix.iv.xxii-p5.2"></a>And they—for at that time they were still subject to the Macedonians—sent to Ptolemy seventy of their elders, who were thoroughly skilled in the Scriptures and in both the languages, to carry out what he had desired. <a name="fr_3710"></a><a href="#fn_3710"><font size="1">3711</font></a>
  But he, wishing to test them individually, and fearing lest they might perchance, by taking counsel together, conceal the truth in the Scriptures, by their interpretation, separated them from each other, and commanded them all to write the same translation. He did this with respect to all the books. But when they came together in the same place before Ptolemy, and  <a name="page_452"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 452</font></a> <a name="ix.iv.xxii-Page_452"></a>  each of them compared his own interpretation with that of every other, God was indeed glorified, and the Scriptures were acknowledged as truly divine. For all of them read out the common translation [which they had prepared] in the very same words and the very same names, from beginning to end, so that even the Gentiles present perceived that the Scriptures had been interpreted by the inspiration of God. <a name="fr_3711"></a><a href="#fn_3711"><font size="1">3712</font></a>
  And there was nothing astonishing in God having done this,—He who, when, during the captivity of the people under Nebuchadnezzar, the Scriptures had been corrupted, and when, after seventy years, the Jews had returned to their own land, then, in the times of Artaxerxes king of the Persians, inspired Esdras the priest, of the tribe of Levi, to recast <a name="fr_3712"></a><a href="#fn_3712"><font size="1">3713</font></a>
  all the words of the former prophets, and to re-establish with the people the Mosaic legislation.</p>  
 <p><a name="ix.iv.xxii-p9"></a>3. <a name="ix.iv.xxii-p9.1"></a>Since, therefore, the Scriptures have been interpreted with such fidelity, and by the grace of God, and since from these God has prepared and formed again our faith towards His Son, and has preserved to us the unadulterated Scriptures in Egypt, where the house of Jacob flourished, fleeing from the famine in Canaan; where also our Lord was preserved when He fled from the persecution set on foot by Herod; and [since] this interpretation of these Scriptures was made prior to our Lords descent [to earth], and came into being before the Christians appeared —for our Lord was born about the forty-first year of the reign of Augustus; but Ptolemy was much earlier, under whom the Scriptures were interpreted;—[since these things are so, I say,] truly these men are proved to be impudent and presumptuous, who would now show a desire to make different translations, when we refute them out of these Scriptures, and shut them up to a belief in the advent of the Son of God. But <i>our</i> faith is stedfast, unfeigned, and the only true one, having clear proof from these Scriptures, which were interpreted in the way I have related; and the preaching of the Church is without interpolation. For the apostles, since they are of more ancient date than all these [heretics], agree with this aforesaid translation; and the translation harmonizes with the tradition of the apostles. For Peter, and John, and Matthew, and Paul, and the rest successively, as well as their followers, did set forth all prophetical [announcements], just as <a name="fr_3713"></a><a href="#fn_3713"><font size="1">3714</font></a>
  the interpretation of the elders contains them.</p>  
 <p><a name="ix.iv.xxii-p11"></a>4. <a name="ix.iv.xxii-p11.1"></a>For the one and the same Spirit of God, who proclaimed by the prophets what and of what sort the advent of the Lord should be, did by these elders give a just interpretation of what had been truly prophesied; and He did Himself, by the apostles, announce that the fulness of the times of the adoption had arrived, that the kingdom of heaven had drawn nigh, and that <i>He</i> was dwelling within those that believe on Him who was born Emmanuel of the Virgin. To this effect they testify, [saying,] that before Joseph had come together with Mary, while she therefore remained in virginity, “she was found with child of the Holy Ghost;” <a name="fr_3714"></a><a href="#fn_3714"><font size="1">3715</font></a>
  and that the angel Gabriel said unto her, “The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee; therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God;” <a name="fr_3715"></a><a href="#fn_3715"><font size="1">3716</font></a>
  and that the angel said to Joseph in a dream, “Now this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, Behold, a virgin shall be with child.” <a name="fr_3716"></a><a href="#fn_3716"><font size="1">3717</font></a>
  But the elders have thus interpreted what Esaias said: “And the Lord, moreover, said unto Ahaz, Ask for thyself a sign from the Lord thy God out of the depth below, or from the height above. And Ahaz said, I will not ask, and I will not tempt the Lord. And he said, It is not a small thing <a name="fr_3717"></a><a href="#fn_3717"><font size="1">3718</font></a>
  for you to weary men; and how does the Lord weary them? Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son; and ye shall call His name Emmanuel. Butter and honey shall He eat: before He knows or chooses out things that are evil, He shall exchange them for what is good; for before the child knows good or evil, He shall not consent to evil, that He may choose that which is good.” <a name="fr_3718"></a><a href="#fn_3718"><font size="1">3719</font></a>
  Carefully, then, has the Holy Ghost pointed out, by what has been said, His birth from a virgin, and His essence, that He is God (for the name Emmanuel indicates this). And He shows that He is a man, when He says, “Butter and honey shall He eat;” and in that He terms Him a child also, [in saying,] “before He knows good and evil;” for these are all the tokens of a human infant. But that He “will not consent to evil, that He may choose that which is good,”—this is proper to God; that by the fact, that He shall eat butter and honey, we should not understand that He is a mere man only, nor, on the other hand, from the name Emmanuel, should suspect Him to be God without flesh.</p>  
 <p><a name="ix.iv.xxii-p17"></a>5. And when He says, “Hear, O house of David,” <a name="fr_3719"></a><a href="#fn_3719"><font size="1">3720</font></a>
  He performed the part of one indicating  <a name="page_453"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 453</font></a> <a name="ix.iv.xxii-Page_453"></a>  that He whom God promised David that He would raise up from the fruit of his belly (<i>ventris</i>) an eternal King, is the same who was born of the Virgin, herself of the lineage of David. <a name="ix.iv.xxii-p18.2"></a>For on this account also, He promised that the King should be “of the fruit of his <i>belly</i>,” which was the appropriate [term to use with respect] to a virgin conceiving, and not “of the fruit of his <i>loins</i>,” nor “of the fruit of his <i>reins</i>,” which expression is appropriate to a generating man, and a woman conceiving by a man. In this promise, therefore, the Scripture excluded all virile influence; yet it certainly is not mentioned that He who was born was not from the will of man. But it has fixed and established “the fruit of the <i>belly</i>,” that it might declare the generation of Him who should be [born] from the Virgin, as Elisabeth testified when filled with the Holy Ghost, saying to Mary, “Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy belly;” <a name="fr_3720"></a><a href="#fn_3720"><font size="1">3721</font></a>
  the Holy Ghost pointing out to those willing to hear, that the promise which God had made, of raising up a King from the fruit of [Davids] belly, was fulfilled in the birth from the Virgin, that is, from Mary. Let those, therefore, who alter the passage of Isaiah thus, “Behold, a young woman shall conceive,” and who will have Him to be Josephs son, also alter the form of the promise which was given to David, when God promised him to raise up, from the fruit of his belly, the horn of Christ the King. But they did not understand, otherwise they would have presumed to alter even this passage also.</p>  
 <p><a name="ix.iv.xxii-p20"></a>6. But what Isaiah said, “From the height above, or from the depth beneath,” <a name="fr_3721"></a><a href="#fn_3721"><font size="1">3722</font></a>
  was meant to indicate, that “He who descended was the same also who ascended.” <a name="fr_3722"></a><a href="#fn_3722"><font size="1">3723</font></a>
  But in this that he said, “The Lord Himself shall give you a sign,” he declared an unlooked-for thing with regard to His generation, which could have been accomplished in no other way than by God the Lord of all, God Himself giving a sign in the house of David. For what great thing or what sign should have been in this, that a young woman conceiving by a man should bring forth,—a thing which happens to all women that produce offspring? But since an unlooked-for salvation was to be provided for men through the help of God, so also was the unlooked-for birth from a virgin accomplished; God giving this sign, but man not working it out.</p>  
 <p><a name="ix.iv.xxii-p23"></a>7. <a name="ix.iv.xxii-p23.1"></a>On this account also, Daniel, <a name="fr_3723"></a><a href="#fn_3723"><font size="1">3724</font></a>
  foreseeing His advent, said that a stone, cut out without hands, came into this world. For this is what “without hands” means, that His coming into this world was not by the operation of human hands, that is, of those men who are accustomed to stone-cutting; that is, Joseph taking no part with regard to it, but Mary alone co-operating with the pre-arranged plan. For this stone from the earth derives existence from both the power and the wisdom of God. Wherefore also Isaiah says: “Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I deposit in the foundations of Zion a stone, precious, elect, the chief, the corner-one, to be had in honour.” <a name="fr_3724"></a><a href="#fn_3724"><font size="1">3725</font></a>
  So, then, we understand that His advent in human nature was not by the will of a man, but by the will of God.</p>  
 <p><a name="ix.iv.xxii-p26"></a>8. <a name="ix.iv.xxii-p26.1"></a>Wherefore also Moses giving a type, cast his rod upon the earth, <a name="fr_3725"></a><a href="#fn_3725"><font size="1">3726</font></a>
  in order that it, by becoming flesh, might expose and swallow up all the opposition of the Egyptians, which was lifting itself up against the pre-arranged plan of God; <a name="fr_3726"></a><a href="#fn_3726"><font size="1">3727</font></a>
  that the Egyptians themselves might testify that it is the finger of God which works salvation for the people, and not the son of Joseph. For if He were the son of Joseph, how could He be greater than Solomon, or greater than Jonah, <a name="fr_3727"></a><a href="#fn_3727"><font size="1">3728</font></a>
  or greater than David, <a name="fr_3728"></a><a href="#fn_3728"><font size="1">3729</font></a>
  when He was generated from the same seed, and was a descendant of these men? And how was it that He also pronounced Peter blessed, because he acknowledged Him to be the Son of the living God? <a name="fr_3729"></a><a href="#fn_3729"><font size="1">3730</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="ix.iv.xxii-p32"></a>9. But besides, if indeed He had been the son of Joseph, He could not, according to Jeremiah, be either king or heir. For Joseph is shown to be the son of Joachim and Jechoniah, as also Matthew sets forth in his pedigree. <a name="fr_3730"></a><a href="#fn_3730"><font size="1">3731</font></a>
  But Jechoniah, and all his posterity, were disinherited from the kingdom; Jeremiah thus declaring, “As I live, saith the Lord, if Jechoniah the son of Joachim king of Judah had been made the signet of my right hand, I would pluck him thence, and deliver him into the hand of those seeking thy life.” <a name="fr_3731"></a><a href="#fn_3731"><font size="1">3732</font></a>
  And again: “Jechoniah is dishonoured as a useless vessel, for he has been cast into a land which he knew not. Earth, hear the word of the Lord: Write this man a disinherited person; for none of his seed, sitting on the throne of David, shall prosper, or be a prince in Judah.” <a name="fr_3732"></a><a href="#fn_3732"><font size="1">3733</font></a>
  And again, God speaks of Joachim his father: “Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning Joachim his father, king of Judea, There shall be from him none sitting upon the throne of David: and his dead body shall be cast out in the heat of day, and in the frost of night. And I will look upon him, and upon  <a name="page_454"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 454</font></a> <a name="ix.iv.xxii-Page_454"></a>  his sons, and will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, upon the land of Judah, all the evils that I have pronounced against them.” <a name="fr_3733"></a><a href="#fn_3733"><font size="1">3734</font></a>
  Those, therefore, who say that He was begotten of Joseph, and that they have hope in Him, do cause themselves to be disinherited from the kingdom, failing under the curse and rebuke directed against Jechoniah and his seed. Because for this reason have these things been spoken concerning Jechoniah, the [Holy] Spirit foreknowing the doctrines of the evil teachers; that they may learn that from his seed—that is, from Joseph—He was not to be born but that, according to the promise of God, from Davids belly the King eternal is raised up, who sums up all things in Himself, and has gathered into Himself the ancient formation [of man]. <a name="fr_3734"></a><a href="#fn_3734"><font size="1">3735</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="ix.iv.xxii-p38"></a>10. For as by one mans disobedience sin entered, and death obtained [a place] through sin; so also by the obedience of one man, righteousness having been introduced, shall cause life to fructify in those persons who in times past were dead. <a name="fr_3735"></a><a href="#fn_3735"><font size="1">3736</font></a>
  And as the protoplast himself Adam, had his substance from untilled and as yet virgin soil (“for God had not yet sent rain, and man had not tilled the ground” <a name="fr_3736"></a><a href="#fn_3736"><font size="1">3737</font></a>
 ), and was formed by the hand of God, that is, by the Word of God, for “all things were made by Him,” <a name="fr_3737"></a><a href="#fn_3737"><font size="1">3738</font></a>
  and the Lord took dust from the earth and formed man; so did He who is the Word, recapitulating Adam in Himself, rightly receive a birth, enabling Him to gather up Adam [into Himself], from Mary, who was as yet a virgin. If, then, the first Adam had a man for his father, and was born of human seed, it were reasonable to say that the second Adam was begotten of Joseph. But if the former was taken from the dust, and God was his Maker, it was incumbent that the latter also, making a recapitulation in Himself, should be formed as man by God, to have an analogy with the former as respects His origin. Why, then, did not God again take dust, but wrought so that the formation should be made of Mary? It was that there might not be another formation called into being, nor any other which should [require to] be saved, but that the very same formation should be summed up [in Christ as had existed in Adam], the analogy having been preserved.</p>
