 <p> <a name="viii.v.iv"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="viii.v.iv-p0.1"></a>Chapter IV.—Shameless practices of the Greeks.</h3>  
 <p><a name="viii.v.iv-p1"></a><a name="viii.v.iv-p1.1"></a><a name="viii.v.iv-p1.2"></a>And your public assemblies I have come to hate. For there are excessive banquetings, and subtle flutes which provoke to lustful movements, and useless and luxurious anointings, and crowning with garlands. With such a mass of evils do you banish shame; and ye fill your minds with them, and are carried away by intemperance, and indulge as a common practice in wicked and insane fornication. And this further I would say to you, why are you, being a Greek, indignant at your son when he imitates Jupiter, and rises against you and defrauds you of your own wife? Why do you count him your enemy, and yet worship one that is like him? And why do you blame your wife for living in unchastity, and yet honour Venus with shrines? If indeed these things had been related by others, they would have seemed to be mere slanderous accusations, and not truth. But now your own poets sing these things, and your histories noisily publish them.</p>
