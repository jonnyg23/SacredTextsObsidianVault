 <p><a name="v.xii.ii-p1"></a>For there is no other time such as this, that I should be accounted worthy of God; neither will ye, if ye be silent, [ever] be found in a better work than this. If ye let me alone, I shall be the word of God; but if ye love my flesh, again am I [only] to myself a voice. Ye cannot give me anything more precious than this, that I should be sacrificed to God, while the altar is ready; that ye may be in one concord in love, and may praise God the Father through Jesus Christ our Lord, because He has deemed a bishop worthy to be Gods, having called him from the east to the west. It is good that I should set from the world in God, that I may rise in Him to life. <a name="fr_1160"></a><a href="#fn_1160"><font size="1">1161</font></a>
