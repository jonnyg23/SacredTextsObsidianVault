 <p><a name="v.x.vi-p1"></a>Look ye to the bishop, that God also may look upon you. I will be instead of the souls of those who are subject to the bishop, and the presbyters, and the deacons; with them may I have a portion in the presence of God! Labour together with one another, act as athletes <a name="fr_1141"></a><a href="#fn_1141"><font size="1">1142</font></a>
  together, run together, suffer together, sleep together, rise together. As stewards of God, and of His household, <a name="fr_1142"></a><a href="#fn_1142"><font size="1">1143</font></a>
  and His servants, please Him and serve Him, that ye may receive from Him the wages [promised]. Let none of you be rebellious. Let your baptism be to you as armour, and faith as a spear, and love as a helmet, and patience as a panoply. Let your treasures be your good works, that ye may receive the gift of God, as is just. Let your spirit be long-suffering towards each other with meekness, even as God [is] toward you. As for me, I rejoice in you at all times.</p>
