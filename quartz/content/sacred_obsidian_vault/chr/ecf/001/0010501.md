 <p> <a name="viii.iv.xl"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="viii.iv.xl-p0.1"></a>Chapter XL.—He returns to the Mosaic laws, and proves that they were figures of the things which pertain to Christ.</h3>  
 <p><a name="viii.iv.xl-p1"></a><a name="viii.iv.xl-p1.1"></a><a name="viii.iv.xl-p1.2"></a><a name="viii.iv.xl-p1.3"></a><a name="viii.iv.xl-p1.4"></a><a name="viii.iv.xl-p1.5"></a><a name="viii.iv.xl-p1.6"></a>“The mystery, then, of the lamb which God enjoined to be sacrificed as the passover, was a type of Christ; with whose blood, in proportion to their faith in Him, they anoint their houses, i.e., themselves, who believe on Him. For that the creation which God created—to wit, Adam—was a house for the spirit which proceeded from God, you all can understand. And that  <a name="page_215"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 215</font></a> <a name="viii.iv.xl-Page_215"></a>  this injunction was temporary, I prove thus. God does not permit the lamb of the passover to be sacrificed in any other place than where His name was named; knowing that the days will come, after the suffering of Christ, when even the place in Jerusalem shall be given over to your enemies, and all the offerings, in short, shall cease; and that lamb which was commanded to be wholly roasted was a symbol of the suffering of the cross which Christ would undergo. For the lamb, <a name="fr_2054"></a><a href="#fn_2054"><font size="1">2055</font></a>
  which is roasted, is roasted and dressed up in the form of the cross. For one spit is transfixed right through from the lower parts up to the head, and one across the back, to which are attached the legs of the lamb. And the two goats which were ordered to be offered during the fast, of which one was sent away as the scape [goat], and the other sacrificed, were similarly declarative of the two appearances of Christ: the first, in which the elders of your people, and the priests, having laid hands on Him and put Him to death, sent Him away as the scape [goat]; and His second appearance, because in the same place in Jerusalem you shall recognise Him whom you have dishonoured, and who was an offering for all sinners willing to repent, and keeping the fast which Isaiah speaks of, loosening the terms <a name="fr_2055"></a><a href="#fn_2055"><font size="1">2056</font></a>
  of the violent contracts, and keeping the other precepts, likewise enumerated by him, and which I have quoted, <a name="fr_2056"></a><a href="#fn_2056"><font size="1">2057</font></a>
  which those believing in Jesus do. And further, you are aware that the offering of the two goats, which were enjoined to be sacrificed at the fast, was not permitted to take place similarly anywhere else, but only in Jerusalem.</p>
