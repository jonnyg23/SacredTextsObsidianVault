 <p> <a name="iv.iv.viii"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="iv.iv.viii-p0.1"></a>Chapter VIII.—Polycarp is brought into the city.</h3>  
 <p><a name="iv.iv.viii-p1"></a><a name="iv.iv.viii-p1.1"></a>Now, as soon as he had ceased praying, having made mention of all that had at any time come in contact with him, both small and great, illustrious and obscure, as well as the whole Catholic Church throughout the world, the time of his departure having arrived, they set him upon an ass, and conducted him into the city, the day being that of the great Sabbath. And the Irenarch Herod, accompanied by his father Nicetes (both riding in a chariot <a name="fr_438"></a><a href="#fn_438"><font size="1">439</font></a>
 ), met him, and taking him up into the chariot, they seated themselves beside him, and endeavoured to persuade him, saying, “What harm is there in saying, Lord Cæsar, <a name="fr_439"></a><a href="#fn_439"><font size="1">440</font></a>
  and in sacrificing, with the other ceremonies observed on such occasions, and so make sure of safety?” But he at first gave them no answer; and when they continued to urge him,  <a name="page_41"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 41</font></a> <a name="iv.iv.viii-Page_41"></a>  he said, “I shall not do as you advise me.” So they, having no hope of persuading him, began to speak bitter <a name="fr_440"></a><a href="#fn_440"><font size="1">441</font></a>
  words unto him, and cast him with violence out of the chariot, <a name="fr_441"></a><a href="#fn_441"><font size="1">442</font></a>
  insomuch that, in getting down from the carriage, he dislocated his leg <a name="fr_442"></a><a href="#fn_442"><font size="1">443</font></a>
  [by the fall]. But without being disturbed, <a name="fr_443"></a><a href="#fn_443"><font size="1">444</font></a>
  and as if suffering nothing, he went eagerly forward with all haste, and was conducted to the stadium, where the tumult was so great, that there was no possibility of being heard.</p>
