 <p><a name="viii.iv.ci-p1"></a><a name="viii.iv.ci-p1.1"></a><a name="viii.iv.ci-p1.2"></a>“Then what follows of the Psalm is this, in which He says: Our fathers trusted in Thee; they trusted, and Thou didst deliver them. They cried unto Thee, and were not confounded. But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people; which show that He admits them to be His fathers, who trusted in God and were saved by Him, who also were the fathers of the Virgin, by whom He was born and became man; and He foretells that He shall be saved by the same God, but boasts not in accomplishing anything through His own will or might. For when on earth He acted in the very same manner, and answered to one who addressed Him as Good Master: Why callest thou me good? One is good, my Father who is in heaven. <a name="fr_2334"></a><a href="#fn_2334"><font size="1">2335</font></a>
  But when He says, I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people, He prophesied the things which do exist, and which happen to Him. For we who believe on Him are everywhere a reproach, despised of the people; for, rejected and dishonoured by your nation, He suffered those indignities which you planned against Him. And the following: All they that see me laughed me to scorn; they spake with the lips, they shook the head: He trusted in the Lord; let Him deliver him, since he desires Him; this likewise He foretold should happen to Him. <a name="viii.iv.ci-p2.2"></a>For they that saw Him crucified shook their heads each one of them, and distorted their lips, and twisting their noses to each other, <a name="fr_2335"></a><a href="#fn_2335"><font size="1">2336</font></a>
  they spake in mockery the words which are recorded in the memoirs of His apostles: He said he was the Son of God: let him come down; let God save him.</p>
