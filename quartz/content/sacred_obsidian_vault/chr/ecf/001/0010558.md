 <p> <a name="viii.iv.xcvii"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="viii.iv.xcvii-p0.1"></a>Chapter XCVII.—Other predictions of the cross of Christ.</h3>  
 <p><a name="viii.iv.xcvii-p1"></a><a name="viii.iv.xcvii-p1.1"></a><a name="viii.iv.xcvii-p1.2"></a><a name="viii.iv.xcvii-p1.3"></a>“For it was not without design that the prophet Moses, when Hur and Aaron upheld his hands, remained in this form until evening. For indeed the Lord remained upon the tree almost until evening, and they buried Him at eventide; then on the third day He rose again. This was declared by David thus: With my voice I cried to the Lord, and He heard me out of His holy hill. I laid me down, and slept; I awaked, for the Lord sustained me. <a name="fr_2319"></a><a href="#fn_2319"><font size="1">2320</font></a>
  And Isaiah likewise mentions concerning Him the manner in which He would die, thus: I have spread out My hands unto a people disobedient, and gainsaying, that walk in a way which is not good. <a name="fr_2320"></a><a href="#fn_2320"><font size="1">2321</font></a>
  And that He would rise again, Isaiah himself said: His burial has been taken away from the midst, and I will give the rich for His death. <a name="fr_2321"></a><a href="#fn_2321"><font size="1">2322</font></a>
  And again, in other words, David in the twenty-first <a name="fr_2322"></a><a href="#fn_2322"><font size="1">2323</font></a>
  Psalm thus refers to the suffering and to the cross in a parable of mystery: They pierced my hands and my feet; they counted all my bones. They considered and gazed on me; they parted my garments among themselves, and cast lots upon my vesture. For when they crucified Him, driving in the nails, they pierced His hands and feet; and those who crucified Him parted  <a name="page_248"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 248</font></a> <a name="viii.iv.xcvii-Page_248"></a>  His garments among themselves, each casting lots for what he chose to have, and receiving according to the decision of the lot. And this very Psalm you maintain does not refer to Christ; for you are in all respects blind, and do not understand that no one in your nation who has been called King or Christ has ever had his hands or feet pierced while alive, or has died in this mysterious fashion—to wit, by the cross—save this Jesus alone.</p>
