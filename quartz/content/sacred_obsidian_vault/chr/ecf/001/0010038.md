 <p> <a name="ii.ii.xxxiii"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="ii.ii.xxxiii-p0.1"></a>Chapter XXXIII.—But let us not give up the practice of good works and love. God Himself is an example to us of good works.</h3>  
 <p><a name="ii.ii.xxxiii-p1"></a><a name="ii.ii.xxxiii-p1.1"></a><a name="ii.ii.xxxiii-p1.2"></a><a name="ii.ii.xxxiii-p1.3"></a><a name="ii.ii.xxxiii-p1.4"></a>What shall we do, then, brethren? Shall we become slothful in well-doing, and cease from the practice of love? God forbid that any such course should be followed by us! But rather let us hasten with all energy and readiness of mind to perform every good work. For the Creator and Lord of all Himself rejoices in His works. For by His infinitely great power He established the heavens, and by His incomprehensible wisdom He adorned them. He also divided the earth from the water which surrounds it, and fixed it upon the immoveable foundation of His own will. The animals also which are upon it He commanded by His own word <a name="fr_133"></a><a href="#fn_133"><font size="1">134</font></a>
  into existence. So likewise, when He had formed the sea, and the living creatures which are in it, He enclosed them [within their proper bounds] by His own power. Above all, <a name="fr_134"></a><a href="#fn_134"><font size="1">135</font></a>
  with His holy and undefiled hands He formed man, the most excellent [of His creatures], and truly great through the understanding given him— the express likeness of His own image. For  <a name="page_14"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 14</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.xxxiii-Page_14"></a>  thus says God: “Let us make man in Our image, and after Our likeness. So God made man; male and female He created them.” <a name="fr_135"></a><a href="#fn_135"><font size="1">136</font></a>
  Having thus finished all these things, He approved them, and blessed them, and said, “Increase and multiply.” <a name="fr_136"></a><a href="#fn_136"><font size="1">137</font></a>
  We see, <a name="fr_137"></a><a href="#fn_137"><font size="1">138</font></a>
  then, how all righteous men have been adorned with good works, and how the Lord Himself, adorning Himself with His works, rejoiced. Having therefore such an example, let us without delay accede to His will, and let us work the work of righteousness with our whole strength.</p>
