 <p> <a name="v.iii.viii"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="v.iii.viii-p0.1"></a>Chapter VIII.—Caution against false doctrines.</h3>  
 <p><a name="v.iii.viii-p1"></a><a name="v.iii.viii-p1.1"></a><a name="v.iii.viii-p1.2"></a><a name="v.iii.viii-p1.3"></a>Be not deceived with strange doctrines, nor with old fables, which are unprofitable. <a name="v.iii.viii-p1.4"></a>For if we still live according to the Jewish law, we acknowledge that we have not received grace. For the divinest prophets lived according to Christ Jesus. <a name="v.iii.viii-p1.5"></a><a name="v.iii.viii-p1.6"></a>On this account also they were persecuted, being inspired by His grace to fully convince the unbelieving that there is one God, who has manifested Himself by Jesus Christ His Son, who is His eternal Word, not proceeding forth from silence, <a name="fr_675"></a><a href="#fn_675"><font size="1">676</font></a>
  and who in all things pleased Him that sent Him.</p>  
 <p><a name="v.iii.viii-p3"></a><a name="v.iii.viii-p3.1"></a><a name="v.iii.viii-p3.2"></a><a name="v.iii.viii-p3.3"></a><a name="v.iii.viii-p3.4"></a>Be not deceived with strange doctrines, “nor give heed to fables and endless genealogies,” <a name="fr_676"></a><a href="#fn_676"><font size="1">677</font></a>
  and things in which the Jews make their boast. “Old things are passed away: behold, all things have become new.” <a name="fr_677"></a><a href="#fn_677"><font size="1">678</font></a>
  For if we still live according to the Jewish law, and the circumcision of the flesh, we deny that we have received grace. For the divinest prophets lived according to Jesus Christ. <a name="v.iii.viii-p5.2"></a>On this account also they were persecuted, being inspired by grace to fully convince the unbelieving that there is one God, the Almighty, who has manifested Himself by Jesus Christ His Son, who is His Word, not spoken, but essential. For He is not the voice of an articulate utterance, but a substance begotten by divine power, who has in all things pleased Him that sent Him. <a name="fr_678"></a><a href="#fn_678"><font size="1">679</font></a>
