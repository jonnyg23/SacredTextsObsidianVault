 <p> <a name="viii.viii.v"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="viii.viii.v-p0.1"></a>Chapter V.—The resurrection of the flesh is not impossible.</h3>  
 <p><a name="viii.viii.v-p1"></a><a name="viii.viii.v-p1.1"></a>But again, of those who maintain that the flesh has no resurrection, some assert that it is impossible; others that, considering how vile and despicable the flesh is, it is not fit that God should raise it; and others, that it did not at the first receive the promise. First, then, in respect of those who say that it is impossible for God to raise it, it seems to me that I should show that they are ignorant, professing as they do in word that they are believers, yet by their works proving themselves to be unbelieving, even more  <a name="page_296"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 296</font></a> <a name="viii.viii.v-Page_296"></a>  unbelieving than the unbelievers. For, seeing that all the heathen believe in their idols, and are persuaded that to them all things are possible (as even their poet Homer says, <a name="fr_2618"></a><a href="#fn_2618"><font size="1">2619</font></a>
  “The gods can do all things, and that easily;” and he added the word “easily” that he might bring out the greatness of the power of the gods), many do seem to be more unbelieving than they. For if the heathen believe in their gods, which are idols (“which have ears, and they hear not; they have eyes, and they see not” <a name="fr_2619"></a><a href="#fn_2619"><font size="1">2620</font></a>
 ), that they can do all things, though they be but devils, as saith the Scripture, “The gods of the nations are devils,” <a name="fr_2620"></a><a href="#fn_2620"><font size="1">2621</font></a>
  much more ought we, who hold the right, excellent, and true faith, to believe in our God, since also we have proofs [of His power], first in the creation of the first man, for he was made from the earth by God; and this is sufficient evidence of Gods power; and then they who observe things can see how men are generated one by another, and can marvel in a still greater degree that from a little drop of moisture so grand a living creature is formed. And certainly if this were only recorded in a promise, and not seen accomplished, this too would be much more incredible than the other; but it is rendered more credible by accomplishment. <a name="fr_2621"></a><a href="#fn_2621"><font size="1">2622</font></a>
  But even in the case of the resurrection the Saviour has shown us accomplishments, of which we will in a little speak. But now we are demonstrating that the resurrection of the flesh is possible, asking pardon of the children of the Church if we adduce arguments which seem to be secular <a name="fr_2622"></a><a href="#fn_2622"><font size="1">2623</font></a>
  and physical: <a name="fr_2623"></a><a href="#fn_2623"><font size="1">2624</font></a>
  first, because to God nothing is secular, not even the world itself, for it is His workmanship; and secondly, because we are conducting our argument so as to meet unbelievers. For if we argued with believers, it were enough to say that we believe; but now we must proceed by demonstrations. The foregoing proofs are indeed quite sufficient to evince the possibility of the resurrection of the flesh; but since these men are exceedingly unbelieving, we will further adduce a more convincing argument still, —an argument drawn not from faith, for they are not within its scope, but from their own mother unbelief,—I mean, of course, from physical reasons. For if by such arguments we prove to them that the resurrection of the flesh is possible, they are certainly worthy of great contempt if they can be persuaded neither by the deliverances of faith nor by the arguments of the world.</p>
