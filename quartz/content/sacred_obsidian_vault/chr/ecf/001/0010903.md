 <p><a name="ix.viii.xxviii-p1"></a><a name="ix.viii.xxviii-p1.1"></a>“And the man of God said, Where did it fall? And he showed him the place. And he cut down a tree, and cast it in there, and the iron floated.” <a name="fr_4842"></a><a href="#fn_4842"><font size="1">4843</font></a>
  This was a sign that souls should be borne aloft (<span class="Greek"><a name="ix.viii.xxviii-p2.2"></a>ἀναγωγῆς ψυχῶν</span>) through the instrumentality of wood, upon which He suffered who can lead those souls aloft that follow His ascension. This event was also an indication of  <a name="page_573"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 573</font></a> <a name="ix.viii.xxviii-Page_573"></a>  the fact, that when the holy soul of Christ descended [to Hades], many souls ascended and were seen in their bodies. <a name="fr_4843"></a><a href="#fn_4843"><font size="1">4844</font></a>
  For just as the wood, which is the lighter body, was submerged in the water; but the iron, the heavier one, floated: so, when the Word of God became one with flesh, by a physical and hypostatic union, the heavy and terrestrial [part], having been rendered immortal, was borne up into heaven, by the divine nature, after the resurrection.</p>
