 <p><a name="iii.ii.xxiv-p1"></a>What advantage should I gain from him who is brought on the stage by Euripides raving mad, and acting the matricide of Alcmæon; who does not even retain his natural behaviour, but with his mouth wide open goes about sword in hand, and, screaming aloud, is burned to death, habited in a robe unfit for man? Away, too, with the mythical tales of Acusilaus, and Menander, a versifier of the same class! And why should I admire the mythic piper? Why should I busy myself about the Theban Antigenides, <a name="fr_487"></a><a href="#fn_487"><font size="1">488</font></a>
  like Aristoxenus? We leave you to these worthless things; and do you either believe our doctrines, or, like us, give up yours.</p>
