 <p><a name="iv.ii.ii.xix-p1"></a>God having thus completed the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and all that are in them, on the sixth day, rested on the seventh day from all His works which He made. Then holy Scripture gives a summary in these words: “This is the book of the generation of the heavens and the earth, when they were created, in the day that the <span class="sc"><a name="iv.ii.ii.xix-p1.1"></a>Lord</span> made the heavens and the earth, and every green thing of the field, before it was made, and every herb of the field before it grew. For God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.” <a name="fr_587"></a><a href="#fn_587"><font size="1">588</font></a>
  By this He signifies to us, that the whole earth was at that time watered by a divine fountain, and had no need that man should till it; but the earth produced all things spontaneously by the command of God, that man might not be wearied by tilling it. But that the creation of man might be made plain, so that there should not seem to be an insoluble problem existing among men, since God had said, “Let Us make man;” and since His creation was not yet plainly related, Scripture teaches us, saying: “And a fountain went up out of the earth, and watered the face of the whole earth; and God made man of the dust of the earth, and breathed into his face the breath of life, and man became a living soul.” <a name="fr_588"></a><a href="#fn_588"><font size="1">589</font></a>
  Whence also by most persons the soul is called immortal. <a name="fr_589"></a><a href="#fn_589"><font size="1">590</font></a>
  And after the formation of man, God chose out for him a region among the places of the East, excellent for light, brilliant with a very bright atmosphere, [abundant] in the finest plants; and in this He placed man.</p>
