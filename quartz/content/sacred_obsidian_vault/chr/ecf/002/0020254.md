 <p><a name="vi.iii.i.iv-p1"></a>Let us, then, embracing more and more this good obedience, give ourselves to the Lord; clinging to what is surest, the cable of faith in Him, and understanding that the virtue of man and woman is the same. For if the God of both is one, the master of both is also one; one church, one temperance, one modesty; their food is common, marriage an equal yoke; respiration, sight, hearing, knowledge, hope, obedience, love all alike. And those whose life is common, have common graces and a common salvation; common to them are love and training. “For in this world,” he says, “they marry, and are given in marriage,” <a name="fr_1047"></a><a href="#fn_1047"><font size="1">1048</font></a>
  in which alone the female is distinguished from the male; “but in that world it is so no more.” There the rewards of this social and holy life, which is based on conjugal union, are laid up, not for male and female, but for man, the sexual desire which divides humanity being removed.  Common therefore, too, to men and women, is the name of man. For this reason I think the Attics called, not boys only, but girls, <span class="Greek"><a name="vi.iii.i.iv-p2.2"></a>παιδάριον</span>, using it as a word of common gender; if Menander the comic poet, in <i>Rhapizomena,</i> appears to any one a sufficient authority, who thus speaks:—</p>  <blockquote><a name="vi.iii.i.iv-p2.3"></a> “My little daughter; for by nature<br>  The child (<span class="Greek"><a name="vi.iii.i.iv-p2.6"></a>παιδάριον</span>) is most loving.<br>  </blockquote>  
 <p class="continue"><a name="vi.iii.i.iv-p3"></a><span class="Greek"><a name="vi.iii.i.iv-p3.1"></a>Ἄρνες</span>, too, the word for lambs, is a common name of simplicity for the male and female animal.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iii.i.iv-p4"></a>Now the Lord Himself will feed us as His flock forever. Amen. But without a sheperd, neither  <a name="page_212"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 212</font></a> <a name="vi.iii.i.iv-Page_212"></a>can sheep nor any other animal live, nor children without a tutor, nor domestics without a master.”</p>
