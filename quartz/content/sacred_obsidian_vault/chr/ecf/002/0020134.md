 <p> <a name="iv.ii.ii.xxxvi"></a> </p><h5 align="center"><a name="iv.ii.ii.xxxvi-p0.1"></a>Chapter XXXVI.—Prophecies of the Sibyl.</h5>  
 <p><a name="iv.ii.ii.xxxvi-p1"></a>And the Sibyl, who was a prophetess among the Greeks and the other nations, in the beginning of her prophecy, reproaches the race of men, saying:—</p>  <a name="page_109"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 109</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.ii.xxxvi-Page_109"></a>  <blockquote><a name="iv.ii.ii.xxxvi-p1.1"></a> “How are ye still so quickly lifted up,<br>  And how so thoughtless of the end of life,<br>  Ye mortal men of flesh, who are but nought?<br>  Do ye not tremble, nor fear God most high?<br>  Your Overseer, the Knower, Seer of all,<br>  Who ever keeps those whom His hand first made,<br>  Puts His sweet Spirit into all His works,<br>  And gives Him for a guide to mortal men.<br>  There is one only uncreated God,<br>  Who reigns alone, all-powerful, very great,<br>  From whom is nothing hid. He sees all things,<br>  Himself unseen by any mortal eye.<br>  Can mortal man see the immortal God,<br>  Or fleshly eyes, which shun the noontide beams,<br>  Look upon Him, who dwells beyond the heavens?<br>  Worship Him then, the self-existent God,<br>  The unbegotten Ruler of the world,<br>  Who only was from everlasting time,<br>  And shall to everlasting still abide.<br>  Of evil counsels ye shall reap the fruit,<br>  Because ye have not honoured the true God,<br>  Nor offered to Him sacred hecatombs.<br>  To those who dwell in Hades ye make gifts,<br>  And unto demons offer sacrifice.<br>  In madness and in pride ye have your walk;<br>  And leaving the right way, ye wander wide,<br>  And lose yourselves in pitfalls and in thorns.<br>  Why do ye wander thus, O foolish men?<br>  Cease your vain wanderings in the black, dark night;<br>  Why follow darkness and perpetual gloom<br>  When, see, there shines for you the blessed light?<br>  Lo, He is clear—in Him there is no spot.<br>  Turn, then, from darkness, and behold the day;<br>  Be wise, and treasure wisdom in your breasts.<br>  There is one God who sends the winds and rains,<br>  The earthquakes, and the lightnings, and the plagues,<br>  The famines, and the snow-storms, and the ice,<br>  And all the woes that visit our sad race.<br>  Nor these alone, but all things else He gives,<br>  Ruling omnipotent in heaven and earth,<br>  And self-existent from eternity.”<br>  </blockquote>  
 <p class="continue"><a name="iv.ii.ii.xxxvi-p2"></a>And regarding those [gods] that are said to have been born, she said:—</p>  <blockquote><a name="iv.ii.ii.xxxvi-p2.1"></a> “If all things that are born must also die,<br>  “God cannot be produced by mortal man.<br>  But there is only One, the All-Supreme,<br>  Who made the heavens, with all their starry host,<br>  The sun and moon; likewise the fruitful earth,<br>  With all the waves of ocean, and the hills,<br>  The fountains, and the ever flowing streams;<br>  He also made the countless multitude<br>  Of ocean creatures, and He keeps alive<br>  All creeping things, both of the earth and sea;<br>  And all the tuneful choir of birds He made,<br>  Which cleave the air with wings, and with shrill pipe<br>  Trill forth at morn their tender, clear-voiced song.<br>  Within the deep glades of the hills He placed<br>  A savage race of beasts; and unto men<br>  He made all cattle subject, making man<br>  The God-formed image, ruler over all,<br>  And putting in subjection to his sway<br>  Things many and incomprehensible.<br>  For who of mortals can know all these things?<br>  He only knows who made them at the first,<br>  He the Creator, incorruptible,<br>  Who dwells in upper air eternally;<br>  Who proffers to the good most rich rewards,<br>  And against evil and unrighteous men<br>  Rouses revenge, and wrath, and bloody wars,<br>  And pestilence, and many a tearful grief.<br>  O man exalted vainly—say why thus<br>  Hast thou so utterly destroyed thyself?<br>  Have ye no shame worshipping beasts for gods?<br>  And to believe the gods should steal your beasts,<br>  Or that they need your vessels—is it not<br>  Frenzys most profitless and foolish thought?<br>  Instead of dwelling in the golden heavens,<br>  Ye see your gods become the prey of worms,<br>  And hosts of creatures noisome and unclean.<br>  O fools! ye worship serpents, dogs, and cats,<br>  Birds, and the creeping things of earth and sea,<br>  Images made with hands, statues of stone,<br>  And heaps of rubbish by the wayside placed.<br>  All these, and many more vain things, ye serve,<br>  Worshipping things disgraceful even to name:<br>  These are the gods who lead vain men astray,<br>  From whose mouth streams of deadly poison flow.<br>  But unto Him in whom alone is life,<br>  Life, and undying, everlasting light;<br>  Who pours into mans cup of life a joy<br>  Sweeter than sweetest honey to his taste,—<br>  Unto Him bow the head, to Him alone,<br>  And walk in ways of everlasting peace.<br>  Forsaking Him, ye all have turned aside,<br>  And, in your raving folly, drained the cup<br>  Of justice quite unmixed, pure, mastering, strong;<br>  And ye will not again be sober men,<br>  Ye will not come unto a sober mind,<br>  And know your God and King, who looks on all:<br>  Therefore, upon you burning fire shall come,<br>  And ever ye shall daily burn in flames,<br>  Ashamed for ever of your useless gods.<br>  But those who worship the eternal God,<br>  They shall inherit everlasting life,<br>  Inhabiting the blooming realms of bliss,<br>  And feasting on sweet food from starry heaven.”<br>  </blockquote>  
 <p class="continue"><a name="iv.ii.ii.xxxvi-p3"></a>That these things are true, and useful, and just, and profitable to all men, is obvious. Even the poets have spoken of the punishments of the wicked.</p>
