 <p><a name="iv.ii.i.iv-p1"></a>And He is without beginning, because He is unbegotten; and He is unchangeable, because He is immortal. And he is called God [<span class="Greek"><a name="iv.ii.i.iv-p1.1"></a>Θεός</span>] on account of His having placed [<span class="Greek"><a name="iv.ii.i.iv-p1.2"></a>τεθεικέναι</span>] all things on security afforded by Himself; and on account of [<span class="Greek"><a name="iv.ii.i.iv-p1.3"></a>θέειν</span>], for <span class="Greek"><a name="iv.ii.i.iv-p1.4"></a>θέειν</span> means running, and moving, and being active, and nourishing, and foreseeing, and governing, and making all things alive. But he is Lord, because He rules over the universe; Father, because he is before all things; Fashioner and Maker, because He is creator and maker of the universe; the Highest, because of His being above all; and Almighty, because He Himself rules and embraces all. For the heights of heaven, and the depths of the abysses, and the ends of the earth, are in His hand, and there is no place of His rest. For the heavens are His work, the earth is His creation, the sea is His handiwork; man is His formation and His image; sun, moon, and stars are His elements, made for signs, and seasons, and days, and years, that they may serve and be slaves to man; and all things God has made out of things that were not <a name="fr_530"></a><a href="#fn_530"><font size="1">531</font></a>
  into things that are, in order that through His works His greatness may be known and understood.</p>
