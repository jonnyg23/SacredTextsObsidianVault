  On the <a name="vi.iv.ix-p3.2"></a>First Epistle of Peter.</h5>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p4"></a><span class="sc"><a name="vi.iv.ix-p4.1"></a>Chap. i. 3.</span> “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who by His great mercy hath regenerated us.” For if God generated us of matter, He afterwards, by progress in life, regenerated us.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p5"></a>“The Father of our Lord, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:” who, according to your faith, rises again in us; as, on the other hand, He dies in us, through the operation of our unbelief. For He said again, that the soul never returns a second time to the body in this life; and that which has become angelic does not become unrighteous or evil, so as not to have the opportunity of again sinning by the assumption of flesh; but that in the resurrection the soul <a name="fr_3713"></a><a href="#fn_3713"><font size="1">3714</font></a>
  returns to the body, and both are joined to one another according to their peculiar nature, adapting themselves, through the composition of each, by a kind of congruity like <a name="fr_3714"></a><a href="#fn_3714"><font size="1">3715</font></a>
  a building of stones.</p>  <a name="vi.iv.ix-p7.1"></a> 
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p8"></a>Besides, Peter says, <a name="fr_3715"></a><a href="#fn_3715"><font size="1">3716</font></a>
  “Ye also, as living stones, are built up a spiritual house;” meaning the place of the angelic abode, guarded in heaven <a name="fr_3716"></a><a href="#fn_3716"><font size="1">3717</font></a>
 .  “For you,” he says, “who are kept by the power of God, by faith and contemplation, to receive the end of your faith, the salvation of your souls.”</p>  <a name="vi.iv.ix-p10.1"></a> 
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p11"></a>Hence it appears that the soul is not naturally immortal; but is made immortal by the grace of God, through faith and righteousness, and by knowledge. “Of which salvation,” he says, <a name="fr_3717"></a><a href="#fn_3717"><font size="1">3718</font></a>
  “the prophets have inquired and searched diligently,” and what follows. It is declared by this that the prophets spake with wisdom, and that the Spirit of Christ was in them, according to the possession of Christ, and in subjection to Christ. For God works through archangels and kindred angels, who are called spirits of Christ.</p>  <a name="vi.iv.ix-p12.2"></a> 
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p13"></a>“Which are now,” he says, <a name="fr_3718"></a><a href="#fn_3718"><font size="1">3719</font></a>
  “reported unto you by them that have preached the Gospel unto you.” The old things which were done by the prophets and escape the observation of most, are now revealed to you by the evangelists.  “For to you,” he says, <a name="fr_3719"></a><a href="#fn_3719"><font size="1">3720</font></a>
  “they are manifested by the Holy Ghost, who was sent;” that is the Paraclete, of whom the Lord said, “If I go not away, He will not come.” <a name="fr_3720"></a><a href="#fn_3720"><font size="1">3721</font></a>
  “Unto whom,” <a name="fr_3721"></a><a href="#fn_3721"><font size="1">3722</font></a>
  it is said, “the angels desire to look;” not the apostate angels, as most suspect, but, what is a divine truth, angels who desire to obtain the advantage of that perfection.</p>  <a name="vi.iv.ix-p17.1"></a> 
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p18"></a>“By precious blood,” he says, <a name="fr_3722"></a><a href="#fn_3722"><font size="1">3723</font></a>
  “as of a lamb without blemish and without spot.” Here he touches on the ancient Levitical and sacerdotal celebrations; but means a soul pure through righteousness which is offered to God.</p>  <a name="vi.iv.ix-p19.2"></a> 
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p20"></a>“Verily foreknown before the foundation of the world.” <a name="fr_3723"></a><a href="#fn_3723"><font size="1">3724</font></a>
  Inasmuch as He was foreknown before every creature, because He was Christ.  <a name="vi.iv.ix-p21.2"></a> <a name="page_572"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 572</font></a> <a name="vi.iv.ix-Page_572"></a>“But manifested in the last times” by the generation of a body. “Being born again, not of corruptible seed.” <a name="fr_3724"></a><a href="#fn_3724"><font size="1">3725</font></a>
  The soul, then, which is produced along with the body is corruptible, as some think.</p>  <a name="vi.iv.ix-p22.2"></a> 
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p23"></a>“But the word of the Lord,” he says, <a name="fr_3725"></a><a href="#fn_3725"><font size="1">3726</font></a>
  “endureth for ever:” as well prophecy as divine doctrine.</p>  <a name="vi.iv.ix-p24.2"></a> 
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p25"></a>“But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood.” <a name="fr_3726"></a><a href="#fn_3726"><font size="1">3727</font></a>
  That we are a chosen race by the election of God is abundantly clear. He says royal, because we are called to sovereignty and belong to Christ; and priesthood on account of the oblation which is made by prayers and instructions, by which are gained the souls which are offered to God.</p>  <a name="vi.iv.ix-p26.2"></a> 
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p27"></a>“Who, when He was reviled,” he says, <a name="fr_3727"></a><a href="#fn_3727"><font size="1">3728</font></a>
  “reviled not; when He suffered, threatened not.” The Lord acted so in His goodness and patience.  “But committed Himself to him that judged Him unrighteously:” <a name="fr_3728"></a><a href="#fn_3728"><font size="1">3729</font></a>
  whether Himself, so that, regarding Himself in this way, there is a transposition. <a name="fr_3729"></a><a href="#fn_3729"><font size="1">3730</font></a>
  He indeed gave Himself up to those who judged according to an unjust law; because He was unserviceable to them, inasmuch as He was righteous: or, He committed to God those who judged unrighteously, and without cause insisted on His death, so that they might be instructed by suffering punishment.</p>  <a name="vi.iv.ix-p30.1"></a> 
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p31"></a>“For he that will love life, and see good days;” <a name="fr_3730"></a><a href="#fn_3730"><font size="1">3731</font></a>
  that is, who wishes to become eternal and immortal. And He calls the Lord life, and the days good, that is holy.</p>  <a name="vi.iv.ix-p32.2"></a> 
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p33"></a>“For the eyes of the Lord,” he says, “are upon the righteous, and His ears on their prayers:” he means the manifold inspection of the Holy Spirit. “The face of the Lord is on them that do evil;” <a name="fr_3731"></a><a href="#fn_3731"><font size="1">3732</font></a>
  that is, whether judgment, or vengeance, or manifestation.</p>  <a name="vi.iv.ix-p34.2"></a> 
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p35"></a>“But sanctify the Lord Christ,” he says, “in your hearts.” <a name="fr_3732"></a><a href="#fn_3732"><font size="1">3733</font></a>
  For so you have in the Lords prayer, “Hallowed be Thy name.” <a name="fr_3733"></a><a href="#fn_3733"><font size="1">3734</font></a>
 </p>  <a name="vi.iv.ix-p37.2"></a> 
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p38"></a>“For Christ,” he says, <a name="fr_3734"></a><a href="#fn_3734"><font size="1">3735</font></a>
  “hath once suffered for our sins, the just for the unjust, that he might present <a name="fr_3735"></a><a href="#fn_3735"><font size="1">3736</font></a>
  us to God; being put to death in the flesh, but quickened in the spirit.” He says these things, reducing them to their faith. That is, He became alive in our spirits.</p>  <a name="vi.iv.ix-p40.1"></a> 
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p41"></a>“Coming,” he says, <a name="fr_3736"></a><a href="#fn_3736"><font size="1">3737</font></a>
  “He preached to those who were once unbelieving.” They saw not His form, but they heard His voice.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p43"></a>“When the long-suffering of God” <a name="fr_3737"></a><a href="#fn_3737"><font size="1">3738</font></a>
  holds out. God is so good, as to work the result by the teaching of salvation.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p45"></a>“By the resurrection,” it is said, <a name="fr_3738"></a><a href="#fn_3738"><font size="1">3739</font></a>
  “of Jesus Christ:” that, namely, which is effected in us by faith.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p47"></a>“Angels being subjected to Him,” <a name="fr_3739"></a><a href="#fn_3739"><font size="1">3740</font></a>
  which are the first order; and “principalities” being subject, who are of the second order; and “powers” being also subject, which are said to belong to the third order.</p>  <a name="vi.iv.ix-p48.2"></a> 
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p49"></a>“Who shall give account,” he says, <a name="fr_3740"></a><a href="#fn_3740"><font size="1">3741</font></a>
  “to Him who is ready to judge the quick and the dead.”</p>  <a name="vi.iv.ix-p50.2"></a> 
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p51"></a>These are trained through previous judgments. <a name="fr_3741"></a><a href="#fn_3741"><font size="1">3742</font></a>
  Therefore he adds, “For this cause was the Gospel preached also to the dead”—to us, namely, who were at one time unbelievers. “That they might be judged according to men,” he says, <a name="fr_3742"></a><a href="#fn_3742"><font size="1">3743</font></a>
  “in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.” Because, that is, they have fallen away from faith; whilst they are still in the flesh they are judged according to preceding judgments, that they might repent. Accordingly, he also adds, saying, “That they might live according to God in the spirit.” So Paul also; for he, too, states something of this nature when he says, “Whom I have delivered to Satan, that he might live in the spirit;” <a name="fr_3743"></a><a href="#fn_3743"><font size="1">3744</font></a>
  that is, “as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.” Similarly also Paul says, “Variously, and in many ways, God of old spake to our fathers.” <a name="fr_3744"></a><a href="#fn_3744"><font size="1">3745</font></a>
 </p>  <a name="vi.iv.ix-p55.2"></a> 
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p56"></a>“Rejoice,” it is said, <a name="fr_3745"></a><a href="#fn_3745"><font size="1">3746</font></a>
  “that ye are partakers in the sufferings of Christ:” that is, if ye are righteous, ye suffer for righteousness sake, as Christ suffered for righteousness. “Happy are ye, for the Spirit of God, who is the Spirit of His glory and virtue, resteth on you.” This possessive “His” signifies also an an angelic spirit:  inasmuch as the glory of God those are, through whom, according to faith and righteousness, He is glorified, to honourable glory, according to the advancement of the saints who are brought in. “The Spirit of God on us,” may be thus understood; that is, who through faith comes on the soul, like a gracefulness of mind and beauty of soul.</p>  <a name="vi.iv.ix-p57.2"></a> 
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p58"></a>“Since,” it is said, <a name="fr_3746"></a><a href="#fn_3746"><font size="1">3747</font></a>
  “it is time for judgment beginning at the house of God.” For judgment will overtake these in the appointed persecutions.</p>  <a name="vi.iv.ix-p59.2"></a> 
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p60"></a>“But the God of all grace,” he says. <a name="fr_3747"></a><a href="#fn_3747"><font size="1">3748</font></a>
  “Of all grace,” he says, because He is good, and the giver of all good things.</p>  <a name="page_573"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 573</font></a> <a name="vi.iv.ix-Page_573"></a>  <a name="vi.iv.ix-p61.2"></a> 
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p62"></a>“Marcus, my son, saluteth you.” <a name="fr_3748"></a><a href="#fn_3748"><font size="1">3749</font></a>
  Mark, the follower of Peter, while Peter publicly preached the Gospel at Rome before some of Cæsars equites, and adduced many testimonies to Christ, in order that thereby they might be able to commit to memory what was spoken, of what was spoken by Peter, wrote entirely what is called the Gospel according to Mark. As Luke also may be recognised <a name="fr_3749"></a><a href="#fn_3749"><font size="1">3750</font></a>
  by the style, both to have composed the Acts of the Apostles, and to have translated Pauls Epistle to the Hebrews.</p>  <a name="vi.iv.ix-p64.1"></a> <h5 align="center"><a name="vi.iv.ix-p64.2"></a>II.—Comments on the Epistle of Jude.</h5>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p65"></a>Jude, who wrote the Catholic Epistle, the brother of the sons of Joseph, and very religious, whilst knowing the near relationship of the Lord, yet did not say that he himself was His brother. But what said he? <a name="fr_3750"></a><a href="#fn_3750"><font size="1">3751</font></a>
  “Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ,”—of Him as Lord; but “the brother of James.” For this is true; he was His brother, (the son) <a name="fr_3751"></a><a href="#fn_3751"><font size="1">3752</font></a>
  of Joseph. “For <a name="fr_3752"></a><a href="#fn_3752"><font size="1">3753</font></a>
  certain men have entered unawares, ungodly men, who had been of old ordained and predestined to the judgment of our God;” not that they might become impious, but that, being now impious, they were ordained to judgment. “For the Lord God,” he says, <a name="fr_3753"></a><a href="#fn_3753"><font size="1">3754</font></a>
  “who once delivered a people out of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not;” that is, that He might train them through punishment. For they were indeed punished, and they perished on account of those that are saved, until they turn to the Lord. “But the angels,” he says, <a name="fr_3754"></a><a href="#fn_3754"><font size="1">3755</font></a>
  “that kept not their own pre-eminence,” that, namely, which they received through advancement, “but left their own habitation,” meaning, that is, the heaven and the stars, became, and are called apostates. “He hath reserved these to the judgment of the great day, in chains, under darkness.” He means the place near the earth, <a name="fr_3755"></a><a href="#fn_3755"><font size="1">3756</font></a>
  that is, the dark air. Now he called “chains” the loss of the honour in which they had stood, and the lust of feeble things; since, bound by their own lust, they cannot be converted. “As Sodom and Gomorrha,” he says. <a name="fr_3756"></a><a href="#fn_3756"><font size="1">3757</font></a>
  … By which the Lord signifies that pardon had been granted; <a name="fr_3757"></a><a href="#fn_3757"><font size="1">3758</font></a>
  and that on being disciplined they had repented. “Similarly <a name="fr_3758"></a><a href="#fn_3758"><font size="1">3759</font></a>
  to the same,” he says, <a name="fr_3759"></a><a href="#fn_3759"><font size="1">3760</font></a>
  “also those dreamers,”—that is, who dream in their imagination lusts and wicked desires, regarding as good not that which is truly good, and superior to all good,—“defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of majesty,” that is, the only Lord, <a name="fr_3760"></a><a href="#fn_3760"><font size="1">3761</font></a>
  who is truly our Lord, Jesus Christ, and alone worthy of praise. They “speak evil of majesty,” that is, of the angels.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p77"></a>“When Michael, the archangel, <a name="fr_3761"></a><a href="#fn_3761"><font size="1">3762</font></a>
  disputing with the devil, debated about the body of Moses.” Here he confirms the assumption of Moses. He is here called Michael, who through an angel near to us debated with the devil.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p79"></a>“But these,” he says, <a name="fr_3762"></a><a href="#fn_3762"><font size="1">3763</font></a>
  “speak evil of those things which they know not; but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in these things they corrupt themselves.” He means that they eat, and drink, and indulge in uncleanness, and says that they do other things that are common to them with animals, devoid of reason.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p81"></a>“Woe unto them!” he says, <a name="fr_3763"></a><a href="#fn_3763"><font size="1">3764</font></a>
  “for they have gone in the way of Cain.” For so also we lie under Adams sin through similarity of sin. “Clouds,” he says, <a name="fr_3764"></a><a href="#fn_3764"><font size="1">3765</font></a>
  “without water; who do not possess in themselves the divine and fruitful word.” Wherefore, he says, “men of this kind are carried about both by winds and violent blasts.” <a name="fr_3765"></a><a href="#fn_3765"><font size="1">3766</font></a>
  “Trees,” he says, “of autumn, without fruit,”—unbelievers, that is, who bear no fruit of fidelity. “Twice dead,” he says: once, namely, when they sinned by transgressing, and a second time when delivered up to punishment, according to the predestined judgments of God; inasmuch as it is to be reckoned death, even when each one does not forthwith deserve the inheritance. “Waves,” he says, <a name="fr_3766"></a><a href="#fn_3766"><font size="1">3767</font></a>
  “of a raging sea.” By these words he signifies the life of the Gentiles, whose end is abominable ambition. <a name="fr_3767"></a><a href="#fn_3767"><font size="1">3768</font></a>
  “Wandering stars,”—that is, he means those who err and are apostates are of that kind of stars which fell from the seats of the angels—“to whom,” for their apostasy, “the blackness of darkness is reserved for ever. Enoch also, the seventh from Adam,” he says, <a name="fr_3768"></a><a href="#fn_3768"><font size="1">3769</font></a>
  “prophesied of these.” In these words he verities the prophecy.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p88"></a>“Those,” he says, <a name="fr_3769"></a><a href="#fn_3769"><font size="1">3770</font></a>
  “separating” the faithful from the unfaithful, be convicted according to their own unbelief. And again those separating from the flesh. <a name="fr_3770"></a><a href="#fn_3770"><font size="1">3771</font></a>
  He says, “Animal <a name="fr_3771"></a><a href="#fn_3771"><font size="1">3772</font></a>
  not having  <a name="page_574"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 574</font></a> <a name="vi.iv.ix-Page_574"></a>the spirit;” that is, the spirit which is by faith, which supervenes through the practice of righteousness.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p92"></a>“But ye, beloved,” he says, <a name="fr_3772"></a><a href="#fn_3772"><font size="1">3773</font></a>
  “building up yourselves on your most holy faith, in the Holy Spirit.” “But some,” he says, <a name="fr_3773"></a><a href="#fn_3773"><font size="1">3774</font></a>
  “save, plucking them from the fire;” <a name="fr_3774"></a><a href="#fn_3774"><font size="1">3775</font></a>
  “but of some have compassion in fear,” that is, teach those who fall into the fire to free themselves. “Hating,” he says, <a name="fr_3775"></a><a href="#fn_3775"><font size="1">3776</font></a>
  “that spotted garment, which is carnal:” that of the soul, namely; the spotted garment is a spirit polluternal lusts. <a name="fr_3776"></a><a href="#fn_3776"><font size="1">3777</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p98"></a>“Now to Him,” he says, <a name="fr_3777"></a><a href="#fn_3777"><font size="1">3778</font></a>
  “who is able to keep you without stumbling, and present you faultless before the presence of His glory in joy.” In the presence of His glory: he means in the presence of the angels, to be presented faultless, having become angels. <a name="fr_3778"></a><a href="#fn_3778"><font size="1">3779</font></a>
  When Daniel speaks of the people and comes into the presence of the Lord, he does not say this, because he saw God: for it is impossible that any one whose heart is not pure should see God; but he says this, that everything that the people did was in the sight of God, and was manifest to Him; that is, that nothing is hid from the Lord.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p101"></a>Now, in the Gospel according to Mark, the Lord being interrogated by the chief of the priests if He was the Christ, the Son of the blessed God, answering, said, “I am; <a name="fr_3779"></a><a href="#fn_3779"><font size="1">3780</font></a>
  and ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power.” <a name="fr_3780"></a><a href="#fn_3780"><font size="1">3781</font></a>
  But powers <a name="fr_3781"></a><a href="#fn_3781"><font size="1">3782</font></a>
  mean the holy angels. Further, when He says “at the right hand of God,” He means the self-same [beings], by reason of the equality and likeness of the angelic and holy powers, which are called by the name of God. He says, therefore, that He sits at the right hand; that is, that He rests in pre-eminent honour. In the other Gospels, however, He is said not to have replied to the high priest, on his asking if He was the Son of God. But what said He? “You say.” <a name="fr_3782"></a><a href="#fn_3782"><font size="1">3783</font></a>
  Answering sufficiently well. For had He said, It is as you understand, he would have said what was not true, not confessing Himself to be the Son of God; [for] they did not entertain this opinion of Him; but by saying “You say,” <a name="fr_3783"></a><a href="#fn_3783"><font size="1">3784</font></a>
  He spake truly. For what they had no knowledge of, but expressed in words, that he confessed to be true.</p>  <a name="vi.iv.ix-p106.1"></a> <h5 align="center"><a name="vi.iv.ix-p106.2"></a>III.—Comments on the First Epistle of John.</h5>

 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p108"></a>Following the Gospel according to John, and in accordance with it, this Epistle also contains the spiritual principle.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p109"></a>What therefore he says, “from the beginning,” the Presbyter explained to this effect, that the beginning of generation is not separated from the beginning of the Creator. For when he says, “That which was from the beginning,” he touches upon the generation without beginning of the Son, who is co-existent with the Father. There was; then, a Word importing an unbeginning eternity; as also the Word itself, that is, the Son of God, who being, by equality of substance, one with the Father, is eternal and uncreate. That He was always the Word, is signified by saying, “In the beginning was the Word.” But by the expression, “we have seen with our eyes,” he signifies the Lords presence in the flesh, “and our hands have handled,” he says, “of the Word of life.” He means not only His flesh, but the virtues of the Son, like the sunbeam which penetrates to the lowest places,—this sunbeam coming in the flesh became palpable to the disciples. It is accordingly related in traditions, that John, touching the outward body itself, sent his hand deep down into it, and that the solidity of the flesh offered no obstacle, but gave way to the hand of the disciple.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p110"></a>“And our hands have handled of the Word of life;” that is, He who came in the flesh became capable of being touched. As also,</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p111"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#002">1 John 1:2</a><a name="vi.iv.ix-p111.1"></a>. “The life was manifested.” For in the Gospel he thus speaks: “And what was made, in Him was life, and the life was the light of men.” <a name="fr_3784"></a><a href="#fn_3784"><font size="1">3785</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p113"></a>“And we show unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto you.”</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p114"></a>He signifies by the appellation of Father, that the Son also existed always, without beginning.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p115"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#005">1 John 1:5</a><a name="vi.iv.ix-p115.1"></a>. “For God,” he says, “is light.”</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p116"></a>He does not express the divine essence, but wishing to declare the majesty of God, he has applied to the Divinity what is best and most excellent in the view of men. Thus also Paul, when he speaks of “light inaccessible.” <a name="fr_3785"></a><a href="#fn_3785"><font size="1">3786</font></a>
  But John himself also in this same Epistle says, “God is love:” <a name="fr_3786"></a><a href="#fn_3786"><font size="1">3787</font></a>
  pointing out the excellences of God, that He is kind and merciful; and because He is light, makes men righteous, according to the advancement of the soul,  <a name="page_575"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 575</font></a> <a name="vi.iv.ix-Page_575"></a>through charity. God, then, who is ineffable in respect of His substance, is light.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p119"></a>“And in Him is no darkness at all,”—that is, no passion, no keeping up of evil respecting any one, [He] destroys no one, but gives salvation to all. Light moreover signifies, either the precepts of the Law, or faith, or doctrine. Darkness is the opposite of these things. Not as if there were another way; since there is only one way according to the divine precepts. For the work of God is unity. Duality and all else that exists, except unity, arises from perversity of life.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p120"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#007">1 John 1:7</a><a name="vi.iv.ix-p120.1"></a>. “And the blood of Jesus Christ His Son,” he says, “cleanses us.” For the doctrine of the Lord, which is very powerful, is called His blood.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p121"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#010">1 John 1:10</a><a name="vi.iv.ix-p121.1"></a>. “If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar, and His word is not in us.” His doctrine, that is, or word is truth.</p>  <a name="vi.iv.ix-p121.2"></a> 
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p122"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001">1 John 2:1</a><a name="vi.iv.ix-p122.1"></a>. “And if any man sin,” he says, “we have an advocate <a name="fr_3787"></a><a href="#fn_3787"><font size="1">3788</font></a>
  with the Father, Jesus Christ.” For so the Lord is an advocate with the Father for us. So also is there, an advocate, whom, after His assumption, He vouchsafed to send. For these primitive and first-created virtues are unchangeable as to substance, and along with subordinate angels and archangels, whose names they share, effect divine operations. Thus also Moses names the virtue of the angel Michael, by an angel near to himself and of lowest grade. The like also we find in the holy prophets; but to Moses an angel appeared near and at hand. Moses heard him and spoke to him manifestly, face to face. On the other prophets, through the agency of angels, an impression was made, as of beings hearing and seeing.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p124"></a>On this account also, they alone heard, and they alone saw; as also is seen in the case of Samuel. <a name="fr_3788"></a><a href="#fn_3788"><font size="1">3789</font></a>
  Elisæus also alone heard the voice by which he was called. <a name="fr_3789"></a><a href="#fn_3789"><font size="1">3790</font></a>
  If the voice had been open and common, it would have been heard by all. In this instance it was heard by him alone in whom the impression made by the angel worked.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p127"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#002">1 John 2:2</a><a name="vi.iv.ix-p127.1"></a>. “And not only for our sins,”—that is for those of the faithful,—is the Lord the propitiator, does he say, “but also for the whole world.” He, indeed, saves all; but some [He saves], converting them by punishments; others, however, who follow voluntarily [He saves] with dignity of honour; so “that every knee should bow to Him, of things in heaven, and things on earth, and things under the earth;” <a name="fr_3790"></a><a href="#fn_3790"><font size="1">3791</font></a>
  that is, angels, men, and souls that before His advent have departed from this temporal life.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p129"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#003">1 John 2:3</a><a name="vi.iv.ix-p129.1"></a>. “And by this we know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments.” For the Gnostic <a name="fr_3791"></a><a href="#fn_3791"><font size="1">3792</font></a>
  [he who knows] also does the Works which pertain to the province of virtue. But he who performs the works is not necessarily also a Gnostic. For a man may be a doer of right works, and yet not a knower of the mysteries of science. Finally, knowing that some works are performed from fear of punishment, and some on account of the promise of reward, he shows the perfection of the man gifted with knowledge, who fulfils his works by love. Further, he adds, and says:—</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p131"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#005">1 John 2:5</a><a name="vi.iv.ix-p131.1"></a>. “But whoso keepeth His word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in Him,”—by faith and love.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p132"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#007">1 John 2:7</a><a name="vi.iv.ix-p132.1"></a>. “I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment, which ye had from the beginning,”—through the Law, that is, and the prophets; where it is said, God is one. Accordingly, also, he infers, “For the old commandment is the word which ye have heard.”</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p133"></a>Again, however, he says:—</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p134"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#008">1 John 2:8</a><a name="vi.iv.ix-p134.1"></a>. “This is the commandment; for the darkness” of perversion, that is, “has passed away, and, lo, the true light hath already shone,”—that is, through faith, through knowledge, through the Covenant working in men, through prepared judgments.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p135"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#009">1 John 2:9</a><a name="vi.iv.ix-p135.1"></a>. “He that saith he is in the light,”—in the light, he means in the truth,—“and hateth,” he says, “his brother.” By his brother, he means not only his neighbour, but also the Lord. For unbelievers hate Him and do not keep His commandments. Therefore also he infers:—</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p136"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#010">1 John 2:10</a><a name="vi.iv.ix-p136.1"></a>. “He that loveth his brother abideth in the light; and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.”</p>

He then indicates the stages of advancement and progress of souls that are still located in the flesh; and calls those whose sins have been forgiven, for the Lords names sake, “little children,” for many believe on account of the name only. He styles “fathers” the perfect, “who have known what was from the beginning,” and received with understanding,—the Son, that is, of whom he said above, “that which was from the beginning.”</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p138"></a>“I write,” says he, “to you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one.” Young man strong in despising pleasures. “The wicked one” points out the eminence of the devil. “The children,” moreover, know the Father; having fled from idols and gathered together to the one God.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p139"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#015">1 John 2:15</a><a name="vi.iv.ix-p139.1"></a>. “For the world,” he says, “is in the  <a name="page_576"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 576</font></a> <a name="vi.iv.ix-Page_576"></a>wicked one.” Is not the world, and all that is in the world, called Gods creation and very good? Yes. But,</p>

He that abideth not in faith.</p>

For it is the greater love that, seeing we have no relationship to God, He nevertheless loves us and calls us His sons. “And it hath not yet appeared what we shall be;” that is, to what kind of glory we shall attain. “For if He shall be manifested,”—that is, if we are made perfect,—“we shall be like Him,” as reposing and justified, pure in virtue, “so that we may see Him” (His countenance) “as He is,” by comprehension.</p>

 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p163"></a>The second Epistle of John, which is written to Virgins, is very simple. It was written to a Babylonian lady, by name Electa, and indicates  <a name="page_577"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 577</font></a> <a name="vi.iv.ix-Page_577"></a>the election of the holy Church. He establishes in this Epistle that the following out of the faith is not without charity, and so that no one divide Jesus Christ; but only to believe that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh. For he who has the Son by apprehension in his intellect knows also the Father, and grasps with his mind intelligibly the greatness of His power working without beginning of time.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p164"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#010">2 John 10</a><a name="vi.iv.ix-p164.1"></a>. He says, “If any come unto you and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed; for he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.” He forbids us to salute such, and to receive them to our hospitality. For this is not harsh in the case of a man of this sort. But he admonishes them neither to confer nor dispute with such as are not able to handle divine things with intelligence, lest through them they be seduced from the doctrine of truth, influenced by plausible reasons. Now, I think that we are not even to pray with such, because in the prayer which is made at home, after rising from prayer, the salutation of joy is also the token of peace.</p>  <a name="vi.iv.ix-p164.2"></a> <h4 align="center"><a name="vi.iv.ix-p164.3"></a>II.—Nicetas <a name="fr_3793"></a><a href="#fn_3793"><font size="1">3794</font></a>
  Bishop of  Heraclea.</h4>  <h5 align="center"><a name="vi.iv.ix-p165.1"></a>From His Catena.</h5>  <h5 align="center"><a name="vi.iv.ix-p165.2"></a>I.—Job i. 21.</h5>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p166"></a>But Jobs words may be more elegantly understood of evil and sin thus: “Naked” was formed from the earth at the beginning, as if from a “mothers womb: naked to the earth shall I also depart;” naked, <a name="fr_3794"></a><a href="#fn_3794"><font size="1">3795</font></a>
  not of possessions, for that were a trivial and common thing, but of evil and sin, and of the unsightly shape which follows those who have led bad lives.  Obviously, all of us human beings are born naked, and again are buried naked, swathed only in grave-clothes. For God hath provided for us another life, and made the present life the way for the course which leads to it; appointing the supplies derived from what we possess merely as provisions for the way; and on our quitting this way, the wealth, consisting of the things which we possessed, journeys no farther with us. For not a single thing that we possess is properly our own: of one possession alone, that is godliness, are we properly owners. Of this, death, when it overtakes us, will not rob us; but from all else it will eject us, though against our will. For it is for the support of life that we all have received what we possess; and after enjoying merely the use of it, each one departs, obtaining from life a brief remembrance. For this is the end of all prosperity; this is the conclusion of the good things of this life. Well, then, does the infant, on opening its eyes, after issuing from the womb, immediately begin with crying, not with laughter. For it weeps, as if bewailing life, at whose hands from the outset it tastes of deadly gifts. For immediately on being born its hands and feet are swaddled; and swathed in bonds it takes the breast. O introduction to life, precursor of death! The child has but just entered on life, and straightway there is put upon it the raiment of the dead: for nature reminds those that are born of their end. Wherefore also the child, on being born, wails, as if crying plaintively to its mother. Why, O mother, didst thou bring me forth to this life, in which prolongation of life is progress to death?  Why hast thou brought me into this troubled world, in which, on being born, swaddling bands are my first experience? Why hast thou delivered me to such a life as this, in which both a pitiable youth wastes away before old age, and old age is shunned as under the doom of death?  Dreadful, O mother, is the course of life, which has death as the goal of the runner. Bitter is the road of life we travel, with the grave as the wayfarers inn. Perilous the sea of life we sail; for it has Hades as a pirate to attack us. Man alone is born in all respects naked, without a weapon or clothing born with him; not as being inferior to the other animals, but that nakedness and your bringing nothing with you may produce thought; and that thought may bring out dexterity, expel sloth, introduce the arts for the supply of our needs, and beget variety of contrivances. For, naked, man is full of contrivances, being pricked on by his necessity, as by a goad, how to escape rains, how to elude cold, how to fence off blows, how to till the earth, how to terrify wild beasts, how to subdue the more powerful of them. Wetted with rain, he contrived a roof; having suffered from cold, he invented clothing; being struck, he constructed a breastplate; bleeding his hands with the thorns in tilling the ground, he availed himself of the help of tools; in his naked state liable to become a prey to wild beasts, he discovered from his fear an art which frightened what frightened him. Nakedness begat one accomplishment after another; so that even his nakedness was a gift and a master-favour. Accordingly, Job also being made naked of wealth, possessions, of the blessing of children, of a numerous offspring, and having lost everything in a short time, uttered this grateful exclamation: “Naked came I out of the womb, naked also shall I depart thither;”—to God, that is, and to that blessed lot and rest.</p>  <a name="vi.iv.ix-p167.1"></a> <h5 align="center"><a name="vi.iv.ix-p167.2"></a>II.—From the Same.</h5>

 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p181"></a>Yes, truly, the apostles were baptised, as Clement the Stromatist relates in the fifth book of the Hypotyposes. For, in explaining the apostolic statement, “I thank God that I baptised none of you,” he says, Christ is said to have baptised Peter alone, and Peter Andrew, and Andrew John, and they James and the rest. <a name="fr_3798"></a><a href="#fn_3798"><font size="1">3799</font></a>

 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p183"></a>Now Clement, writing in the sixth book of the Hypotyposes, makes this statement. For he says that Peter and James and John, after the Saviours ascension, though pre-eminently honoured by the Lord, did not contend for glory, but made James the Just, bishop of Jerusalem.</p>  <h5 align="center"><a name="vi.iv.ix-p183.1"></a>Eusebius: Ecclesiastical History, II.  15.</h5>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p184"></a>So, then, through the visit of the divine word to them, the power of Simon was extinguished, and immediately was destroyed along with the man himself. And such a ray of godliness shone forth on the minds of Peters hearers, that they were not satisfied with the once hearing or with the unwritten teaching of the divine proclamation, but with all manner of entreaties importuned Mark, to whom the Gospel is ascribed, he being the companion of Peter, that he would leave in writing a record of the teaching which had been delivered to them verbally; and did not let the man alone till they prevailed upon him; and so to them we owe the Scripture called the “Gospel by Mark.” On learning what had been done, through the revelation of the Spirit, it is said that the apostle was delighted with the enthusiasm of the men, and sanctioned the composition for reading in the Churches. Clemens gives the narrative in the sixth book of the Hypotyposes.</p>  <h5 align="center"><a name="vi.iv.ix-p184.1"></a>Eusebius: Ibid.</h5>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p185"></a>Then, also, as the divine Scripture says, Herod, on the execution of James, seeing that what was done pleased the Jews, laid hands also on Peter; and having put him in chains, would have presently put him to death, had not an angel in a divine vision appeared to him by night, and wondrously releasing him from his bonds, sent him away to the ministry of preaching.</p>  <h5 align="center"><a name="vi.iv.ix-p185.1"></a>Eusebius: Ecclesiastical History, VI.  14.</h5>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p186"></a>And in the Hypotyposes, in a word, he has made abbreviated narratives of the whole testamentary Scripture; and has not passed over the disputed books,—I mean Jude and the rest of the Catholic Epistles and Barnabas, and what is called the Revelation of Peter. And he says that the Epistle to the Hebrews is Pauls, and was written to the Hebrews in the Hebrew language; but that Luke, having carefully translated it, gave it to the Greeks, and hence the same colouring in the expression is discoverable in this Epistle and the Acts; and that the name “Paul an Apostle” was very properly not prefixed, for, he says, that writing to the Hebrews, who were prejudiced against him and suspected, he with great wisdom did not repel them in the beginning by putting down his name.</p>  <h5 align="center"><a name="vi.iv.ix-p186.1"></a>Eusebius: Book VII.</h5>  <a name="vi.iv.ix-p186.2"></a>

Accordingly, he says, they were both led away together, and on the way the other asked James to forgive him. And he, considering a little, said, “Peace be to thee” and kissed him.

 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p199"></a>Again, in the same books Clement has set down a tradition which he had received from the elders before him, in regard to the order of the Gospels, to the following effect. He says that the Gospels containing the genealogies were written first, and that the Gospel according to Mark was composed in the following circumstances:—</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p200"></a>Peter having preached the word publicly at Rome, and by the Spirit proclaimed the Gospel, those who were present, who were numerous, entreated Mark, inasmuch as he had attended him from an early period, and remembered what had been said, to write down what had been spoken. On his composing the Gospel, he handed it to those who had made the request to him; which coming to Peters knowledge, he neither hindered nor encouraged. But John, the last of all, seeing that what was corporeal was set forth in the Gospels, on the entreaty of his intimate friends, and inspired by the Spirit, composed a spiritual Gospel.</p>  <h5 align="center"><a name="vi.iv.ix-p200.1"></a>V.—From the Book on Providence.</h5>  <h5 align="center"><a name="vi.iv.ix-p200.2"></a>S.

 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p226"></a>Suitably, therefore, to the fourteenth day, on which He also suffered, in the morning, the chief priests and the scribes, who brought Him to Pilate, did not enter the Prætorium, that they might not be defiled, but might freely eat the passover in the evening. With this precise determination of the days both the whole Scriptures agree, and the Gospels harmonize. The resurrection also attests it. He certainly rose on the third day, which fell on the first day of the weeks of harvest, on which the law prescribed that the priest should offer up the sheaf.</p>  <a name="vi.iv.ix-p226.1"></a> <h5 align="center"><a name="vi.iv.ix-p226.2"></a>Macarius Chrysocephalus: Parable of the Prodigal Son, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#000">Luke xv.</a><a name="vi.iv.ix-p226.3"></a>, Oration on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#000">Luke xv.</a><a name="vi.iv.ix-p226.4"></a>, Towards the Close.</h5>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p227"></a>1. What choral dance and high festival is held in heaven, if there is one that has become an exile and a fugitive from the life led under the Father, knowing not that those who put themselves  <a name="page_582"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 582</font></a> <a name="vi.iv.ix-Page_582"></a>far from Him shall perish; if he has squandered the gift, and substance, and inheritance of the Father; if there is one whose faith has failed, and whose hope is spent, by rushing along with the Gentiles into the same profligacy of debauchery; and then, famished and destitute, and not even filled with what the swine eat, has arisen and come to his Father!</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p228"></a>But the kind Father waits not till the son comes to Him.  For perchance he would never be able or venture to approach, did he not find Him gracious. Wherefore, when he merely wishing, when he straightway made a beginning, when he took the first step, while he was yet a great way off, He [the Father] was moved with compassion, and ran, and fell upon his neck and kissed him. And then the son, taking courage, confessed what he had done.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p229"></a>Wherefore the Father bestows on him the glory and honour that was due and meet, putting on him the best robe, the robe of immortality; and a ring, a royal signet and divine seal,—impress of consecration, signature of glory, pledge of testimony (for it is said, “He hath set to his seal that God is true,”) <a name="fr_3805"></a><a href="#fn_3805"><font size="1">3806</font></a>
  and shoes, not those perishable ones which he hath set his foot on holy ground is bidden take off, nor such as he who is sent to preach the kingdom of heaven is forbidden to put on, but such as wear not, and are suited for the journey to heaven, becoming and adorning the heavenly path, such as unwashed feet never put on, but those which are washed by our Teacher and Lord.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p231"></a>Many, truly, are the shoes of the sinful soul, by which it is bound and cramped. For each man is cramped by the cords of his own sins. Accordingly, Abraham swears to the king of Sodom, “I will not take of all that is thine, from a thread to a shoe-latchet.” <a name="fr_3806"></a><a href="#fn_3806"><font size="1">3807</font></a>
  On account of these being defiled and polluted on the earth, every kind of wrong and selfishness engrosses life. As the Lord reproves Israel by Amos, saying, “For three iniquities of Israel, yea, for four, I will not turn him back; because they have given away the righteous for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes, which tread upon the dust of the ground.” <a name="fr_3807"></a><a href="#fn_3807"><font size="1">3808</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p234"></a>2. Now the shoes which the Father bids the servant give to the repentant son who has betaken himself to Him, do not impede or drag to the earth (for the earthly tabernacle weighs down the anxious mind); but they are buoyant, and ascending, and waft to heaven, and serve as such a ladder and chariot as he requires who has turned his mind towards the Father. For, beautiful after being first beautifully adorned with all these things without, he enters into the gladness within. For “Bring out” was said by Him who had first said, “While he was yet a great way off, he ran and fell upon his neck.” For it is here <a name="fr_3808"></a><a href="#fn_3808"><font size="1">3809</font></a>
  that all the preparation for entrance to the marriage to which we are invited must be accomplished. He, then, who has been made ready to enter will say, “This my joy is fulfilled.” <a name="fr_3809"></a><a href="#fn_3809"><font size="1">3810</font></a>
  But the unlovely and unsightly man will hear, “Friend, how camest thou in here, without having a wedding garment?” <a name="fr_3810"></a><a href="#fn_3810"><font size="1">3811</font></a>
  And the fat and unctuous food,—the delicacies abundant and sufficing of the blessed,—the fatted calf is killed; which is also again spoken of as a lamb (not literally); that no one may suppose it small; but it is the great and greatest. For not small is “the Lamb of God who taketh away the sin of the world,” <a name="fr_3811"></a><a href="#fn_3811"><font size="1">3812</font></a>
  who “was led as a sheep to the slaughter,” the sacrifice full of marrow, all whose fat, according to the sacred law, was the Lords. For He was wholly devoted and consecrated to the Lord; so well grown, and to such excessive size, as to reach and extend over all, and to fill those who eat Him and feed upon Him. For He is both flesh and bread, and has given Himself as both to us to be eaten.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p239"></a>To the sons, then, who come to Him, the Father gives the calf, and it is slain and eaten. But those who do not come to Him He pursues and disinherits, and is found to be a most powerful bull. Here, by reason of His size and prowess, it is said of Him, “His glory is as that of an unicorn.” <a name="fr_3812"></a><a href="#fn_3812"><font size="1">3813</font></a>
  And the prophet Habakkuk sees Him bearing horns, and celebrates His defensive attitude—“horns in His hands.” <a name="fr_3813"></a><a href="#fn_3813"><font size="1">3814</font></a>
  Wherefore the sign shows His power and authority,—horns that pierce on both sides, or rather, on all sides, and through everything. And those who eat are so strengthened, and retain such strength from the life-giving food in them, that they themselves are stronger than their enemies, and are all but armed with the horns of a bull; as it is said, “In thee shall we butt our enemies.” <a name="fr_3814"></a><a href="#fn_3814"><font size="1">3815</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p243"></a>3. Gladness there is, and music, and dances; although the elder son, who had ever been with and ever obedient to the Father, takes it ill, when he who never had himself been dissipated or profligate sees the guilty one made happy.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p244"></a>Accordingly the Father calls him, saying, “Son, thou art ever with me.” And what greater joy and feast and festivity can be than being continually with God, standing by His side and serving Him? “And all that is mine is thine.” And blessed is the heir of God, for whom the  <a name="page_583"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 583</font></a> <a name="vi.iv.ix-Page_583"></a>Father holds possession,—the faithful, to whom the whole world of possessions belongs.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p245"></a>“It was meet that we should be glad, and rejoice; for thy brother was dead, and is alive again.” Kind Father, who givest all things life, and raisest the dead. “And was lost, and is found.” And “blessed is the man whom Thou hast chosen and accepted,” <a name="fr_3815"></a><a href="#fn_3815"><font size="1">3816</font></a>
  and whom having sought, Thou dost find. “Blessed are those whose iniquities are forgiven, whose sins are covered.” <a name="fr_3816"></a><a href="#fn_3816"><font size="1">3817</font></a>
  It is for man to repent of sins; but let this be accompanied with a change that will not be checked. For he who does not act so shall be put to shame, because he has acted not with his whole heart, but in haste.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p248"></a>And it is ours to flee to God. And let us endeavour after this ceaselessly and energetically. For He says, “Come unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” <a name="fr_3817"></a><a href="#fn_3817"><font size="1">3818</font></a>
  And prayer and confession with humility are voluntary acts. Wherefore it is enjoined, “First tell thy sins, that thou mayest be justified.” <a name="fr_3818"></a><a href="#fn_3818"><font size="1">3819</font></a>
  What afterwards we shall obtain, and what we shall be, it is not for us to judge.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p251"></a>4. Such is the strict meaning of the parable. <a name="fr_3819"></a><a href="#fn_3819"><font size="1">3820</font></a>
  The repentant son came to the pitying Father, never hoping for these things,—the best robe, and the ring, and the shoes,—or to taste the fatted calf, or to share in gladness, or enjoy music and dances; but he would have been contented with obtaining what in his own estimation he deemed himself worth. “Make me,” he had made up his mind to say, “as one of thy hired servants.” But when he saw the Fathers welcome meeting him, he did not say this, but said what he had in his mind to say first, “Father, I have sinned against Heaven, and before thee.” And so both his humility and his accusation became the cause of justification and glory. For the righteous man condemns himself in his first words. So also the publican departed justified rather than the Pharisee. The son, then, knew not either what he was to obtain, or how to take or use or put on himself the things given him; since he did not take the robe himself, and put it on. But it is said, “Put it on him.” He did not himself put the ring on his finger, but those who were bidden “Put a ring on his hand.” Nor did he put the shoes on himself, but it was they who heard, “and shoes on his feet.”</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p253"></a>And these things were perhaps incredible to him and to others, and unexpected before they took place; but gladly received and praised were the gifts with which he was presented.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p254"></a>5. The parable exhibits this thought, that the exercise of the faculty of reason has been accorded to each man. Wherefore the prodigal is introduced, demanding from his father his portion, that is, of the state of mind, endowed by reason. For the possession of reason is granted to all, in order to the pursuit of what is good, and the avoidance of what is bad. But many who are furnished by God with this make a bad use of the knowledge that has been given them, and land in the profligacy of evil practices, and wickedly waste the substance of reason,—the eye on disgraceful sights, the tongue on blasphemous words, the smell on fœtid licentious excesses of pleasures, the mouth on swinish gluttony, the hands on thefts, the feet on running into plots, the thoughts on impious counsels, the inclinations on indulgence on the love of ease, the mind on brutish pastime. They preserve nothing of the substance of reason unsquandered. Such an one, therefore, Christ represents in the parable,—as a rational creature, with his reason darkened, and asking from the Divine Being what is suitable to reason; then as obtaining from God, and making a wicked use of what had been given, and especially of the benefits of baptism, which had been vouchsafed to him; whence also He calls him a prodigal; and then, after the dissipation of what had been given him, and again his restoration by repentance, [He represents] the love of God shown to him.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p255"></a>6. For He says, “Bring hither the fatted calf, kill it, and let us eat and be merry; for this my son”—a name of nearest relationship, and significative of what is given to the faithful—“was dead and lost,”—an expression of extremest alienation; for what is more alien to the living than the lost and dead? For neither can be possessed any more. But having from the nearest relationship fallen to extremest alienation, again by repentance he returned to near relationship. For it is said, “Put on him the best robe,” which was his the moment he obtained baptism. I mean the glory of baptism, the remission of sins, and the communication of the other blessings, which he obtained immediately he had touched the font.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p256"></a>“And put a ring on his hand.” Here is the mystery of the Trinity; which is the seal impressed on those who believe.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p257"></a>“And put shoes on his feet,” for “the preparation of the Gospel of peace,” <a name="fr_3820"></a><a href="#fn_3820"><font size="1">3821</font></a>
  and the whole course that leads to good actions.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p259"></a>7. But whom Christ finds lost, after sin committed since baptism, those Novatus, enemy of God, resigns to destruction. Do not let us then reckon any fault if we repent; guarding against falling, let us, if we have fallen, retrace our steps. And while dreading to offend, let us, after offending,  <a name="page_584"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 584</font></a> <a name="vi.iv.ix-Page_584"></a>avoid despair, and be eager to be confirmed; and on sinking, let us haste to rise up again. Let us obey the Lord, who calls to us, “Come unto Me, all ye that labour, and I will give you rest.” <a name="fr_3821"></a><a href="#fn_3821"><font size="1">3822</font></a>
  Let us employ the gift of reason for actions of prudence. Let us learn now abstinence from what is wicked, that we may not be forced to learn in the future. Let us employ life as a training school for what is good; and let us be roused to the hatred of sin. Let us bear about a deep love for the Creator; let us cleave to Him with our whole heart; let us not wickedly waste the substance of reason, like the prodigal. Let us obtain the joy laid up, in which Paul exulting, exclaimed, “Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?” <a name="fr_3822"></a><a href="#fn_3822"><font size="1">3823</font></a>

  alluding to the offences of sinners under the name of crooked ways. For the straight way, and that according to nature, which is pointed out by the iota of Jesus, is His goodness, which is immoveable towards those who have obediently believed. There shall not then pass away from the law neither the iota nor the tittle; that is, neither the promise that applies to the straight in the way, nor the punishment threatened against those that diverge. For the Lord is good to the straight in the way; but “those that turn aside after their crooked ways He shall lead forth with those that work iniquity.” <a name="fr_3825"></a><a href="#fn_3825"><font size="1">3826</font></a>

  ceased to live after the flesh. How? Not by putting off the body! Far be it! For with it as His own He shall come, the Judge of all. But by divesting Himself of physical affections, such as hunger, and thirst, and sleep, and weariness. For now He has a body incapable of suffering and of injury.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p292"></a>As “after the flesh” in our case is being in the midst of sins, and being out of them is to be “not after the flesh;” so also after the flesh, in the case of Christ, was His subjection to natural affections, and not to be subject to them was not to be “after the flesh.” “But,” he says, “as He was released, so also are we.” <a name="fr_3834"></a><a href="#fn_3834"><font size="1">3835</font></a>
  Let there be no longer, he says, subjection to the influences of the flesh. Thus Clement, the fourth book of the <i>Hypotyposes.</i></p>  <h5 align="center"><a name="vi.iv.ix-p293.1"></a>14. From the Same, p. 391.</h5>  <a name="vi.iv.ix-p293.2"></a>

There are a good many various readings; but although the passage in question, as found in Cramers work, is printed in full in Mignes edition, on the alleged ground of the considerable variation from the text of Clement, the variation is not such as to make a translation of the passage as found in Cramer of any special interest or value.</p>

 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p2"></a> [M. Aurelius Cassiodorus (whose name is also Senator) was an author and public man of the sixth century, and a very voluminous writer. He would shine with a greater lustre were he not so nearly lost in the brighter light of Boëthius, his illustrious contemporary. After the death of his patron, Theodoric, he continued for a time in the public service, and in high positions, but, at seventy years of age, began another career, and for twenty years devoted himself to letters and the practice of piety in a monastery which he established in the Neopolitan kingdom, near his native Squillace. Died about <span class="sc"><a name="vi.iv.ix-p2.1"></a>a.d.</span> 560.]</p>

 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p3"></a> Comments, i.e., <i>Adumbrationes</i>.  Cassiodorus says that he had in his translation corrected what he considered erroneous in the original. So Fell states: and he is also inclined to believe that these fragments are from Clements lost work, the <span class="Greek"><a name="vi.iv.ix-p3.1"></a>Ὑποτυπώσεις</span>, of which he believes <i>The Adumbrationes</i> of Cassiodorus to be a translation.</p>

 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p6"></a> “Utramque” is the reading, which is plainly corrupt. We have conjectured “animam.” The rest of the sentence is so ungrammatical and impracticable as it stands, that it is only by taking considerable liberties with it that it is translateable at all.</p>

 <p><a name="vi.iv.ix-p7"></a> The text here has <i>like a drag-net or (sicut sagena vel)</i>, which we have omitted, being utterly incapable of divining any conceivable resemblance or analogy which a drag-net can afford for the re-union of the soul and body.  “Sagena” is either a blunder for something else which we cannot conjecture, or the sentence is here, as elsewhere, mutilated.  But it is possible that it may have been the union of the blessed to each other, and their conjunction with one another according to their affinities, which was the point handled in the original sentences, of which we have only these obscure and confusing remains. [A very good conjecture, on the strength of which the text might have been let as it stood.]</p>
