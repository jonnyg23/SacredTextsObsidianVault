 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii.xvii-p1"></a>It behoved, therefore, that he should the rather become a scholar of God in this matter of legislation, as he himself confessed that in no other way could he gain accurate information than by Gods teaching him through the law. And did not the poets Homer and Hesiod and Orpheus profess that they themselves had been instructed by Divine Providence? Moreover, it is said that among your writers there were prophets and prognosticators, and that those wrote accurately who were informed by them. How much more, then, shall <i>we</i> know the truth who are instructed by the holy prophets, who were possessed by <a name="fr_673"></a><a href="#fn_673"><font size="1">674</font></a>
