 <p> <a name="vi.iv.vi.viii"></a> </p><h5 align="center"><a name="vi.iv.vi.viii-p0.1"></a>Chapter VIII.—Philosophy is Knowledge Given by God.</h5>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.vi.viii-p1"></a>For Paul too, in the Epistles, plainly does not disparage philosophy; but deems it unworthy of the man who has attained to the elevation of the Gnostic, any more to go back to the Hellenic “philosophy,” figuratively calling it “the rudiments of this world,” <a name="fr_3304"></a><a href="#fn_3304"><font size="1">3305</font></a>
  as being most rudimentary, and a preparatory training for the truth. Wherefore also, writing to the Hebrews, who were declining again from faith to the law, he says, “Have ye not need again of one to teach you which are the first principles of the oracles of God, and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat?” <a name="fr_3305"></a><a href="#fn_3305"><font size="1">3306</font></a>
  So also to the Colossians, who were Greek converts, “Beware lest any man spoil you by philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of this world, and not after Christ,” <a name="fr_3306"></a><a href="#fn_3306"><font size="1">3307</font></a>
 —enticing them again to return to philosophy, the elementary doctrine.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.vi.viii-p5"></a>And should one say that it was through human understanding that philosophy was discovered by the Greeks, still I find the Scriptures saying that understanding is sent by God. The psalmist, accordingly, considers understanding as the greatest free gift, and beseeches, saying, “I am Thy servant; give me understanding.” <a name="fr_3307"></a><a href="#fn_3307"><font size="1">3308</font></a>
  And does not David, while asking the abundant experience of knowledge, write, “Teach me gentleness, and discipline, and knowledge: for I have believed in Thy commandments?” <a name="fr_3308"></a><a href="#fn_3308"><font size="1">3309</font></a>
  He confessed the covenants to be of the highest authority, and that they were given to the more excellent. Accordingly the psalm again says of God, “He hath not done thus to any nation; and He hath not shown His judgments to them.” <a name="fr_3309"></a><a href="#fn_3309"><font size="1">3310</font></a>
  The expression “He hath not done so” shows that <i>He hath done</i>, but not “thus.” The “thus,” then, is put comparatively, with reference to pre-eminence, which obtains in our case. The prophet might have said simply, “He hath not done,” without the “thus.”</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.vi.viii-p9"></a>Further, Peter in the Acts says, “Of a truth, I perceive that God is no respecter of persons; but in every nation he that feareth Him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted by Him.” <a name="fr_3310"></a><a href="#fn_3310"><font size="1">3311</font></a>
 </p>  <a name="page_495"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 495</font></a> <a name="vi.iv.vi.viii-Page_495"></a>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.vi.viii-p11"></a>The absence of respect of persons in God is not then in time, but from eternity. Nor had His beneficence a beginning; nor any more is it limited to places or persons. For His beneficence is not confined to parts. “Open ye the gates of righteousness,” it is said; “entering into them, I will confess to the <span class="sc"><a name="vi.iv.vi.viii-p11.1"></a>Lord</span>. This is the gate of the <span class="sc"><a name="vi.iv.vi.viii-p11.2"></a>Lord</span>. The righteous shall enter by it.” <a name="fr_3311"></a><a href="#fn_3311"><font size="1">3312</font></a>
  Explaining the prophets saying, Barnabas adds, “There being many gates open, that which is in righteousness is the gate which is in Christ, by which all who enter are blessed.” Bordering on the same meaning is also the following prophetic utterance: “The <span class="sc"><a name="vi.iv.vi.viii-p12.2"></a>Lord</span> is on many waters;” <a name="fr_3312"></a><a href="#fn_3312"><font size="1">3313</font></a>
  not the different covenants alone, but the modes of teaching, those among the Greek and those among the Barbarians, conducing to righteousness. And already clearly David, bearing testimony to the truth, sings, “Let sinners be turned into Hades, and all the nations that forget God.” <a name="fr_3313"></a><a href="#fn_3313"><font size="1">3314</font></a>
  They forget, plainly, Him whom they formerly remembered, and dismiss Him whom they knew previous to forgetting Him. There was then a dim knowledge of God also among the nations. So much for those points.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.vi.viii-p15"></a>Now the Gnostic must be erudite. And since the Greeks say that Protagoras having led the way, the opposing of one argument by another was invented, it is fitting that something be said with reference to arguments of this sort. For Scripture says, “He that says much, shall also hear in his turn.” <a name="fr_3314"></a><a href="#fn_3314"><font size="1">3315</font></a>
  And who shall understand a parable of the Lord, but the wise, the intelligent, and he that loves his Lord? Let such a man be faithful; let him be capable of uttering his knowledge; let him be wise in the discrimination of words; let him be dexterous in action; let him be pure. “The greater he seems to be, the more humble should he be,” says Clement in the Epistle to the Corinthians,—“such an one as is capable of complying with the precept, And some pluck from the fire, and on others have compassion, making a difference,” <a name="fr_3315"></a><a href="#fn_3315"><font size="1">3316</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.vi.viii-p18"></a>The pruning-hook is made, certainly, principally for pruning; but with it we separate twigs that have got intertwined, cut the thorns which grow along with the vines, which it is not very easy to reach. And all these things have a reference to pruning. Again, man is made principally for the knowledge of God; but he also measures land, practices agriculture, and philosophizes; of which pursuits, one conduces to life, another to living well, a third to the study of the things which are capable of demonstration. Further, let those who say that philosophy took its rise from the devil know this, that the Scripture says that “the devil is transformed into an angel of light.” <a name="fr_3316"></a><a href="#fn_3316"><font size="1">3317</font></a>
  When about to do what? Plainly, when about to prophesy. But if he prophesies as an angel of light, he will speak what is true. And if he prophesies what is angelical, and of the light, then he prophesies what is beneficial when he is transformed according to the likeness of the operation, though he be different with respect to the matter of apostasy. For how could he deceive any one, without drawing the lover of knowledge into fellowship, and so drawing him afterwards into falsehood? Especially he will be found to know the truth, if not so as to comprehend it, yet so as not to be unacquainted with it.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.vi.viii-p20"></a>Philosophy is not then false, though the thief and the liar speak truth, through a transformation of operation. Nor is sentence of condemnation to be pronounced ignorantly against what is said, on account of him who says it (which also is to be kept in view, in the case of those who are now alleged to prophesy); but what is said must be looked at, to see if it keep by the truth.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.vi.viii-p21"></a>And in general terms, we shall not err in alleging that all things necessary and profitable for life came to us from God, and that philosophy more especially was given to the Greeks, as a covenant peculiar to them—being, as it is, a stepping-stone to the philosophy which is according to Christ—although those who applied themselves to the philosophy of the Greeks shut their ears voluntarily to the truth, despising the voice of Barbarians, or also dreading the danger suspended over the believer, by the laws of the state.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.vi.viii-p22"></a>And as in the Barbarian philosophy, so also in the Hellenic, “tares were sown” by the proper husbandman of the tares; whence also heresies grew up among us along with the productive wheat; and those who in the Hellenic philosophy preach the impiety and voluptuousness of Epicurus, and whatever other tenets are disseminated contrary to right reason, exist among the Greeks as spurious fruits of the divinely bestowed husbandry. This voluptuous and selfish philosophy the apostle calls “the wisdom of this world;” in consequence of its teaching the things of this world and about it alone, and its consequent subjection, as far as respects ascendancy, to those who rule here. Wherefore also this fragmentary philosophy is very elementary, while truly perfect science deals with intellectual objects, which are beyond the sphere of the world, and with the objects still more spiritual than those which “eye saw not, and ear heard not, nor did it enter into the heart of men,” till the Teacher told the account of them to us;  <a name="page_496"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 496</font></a> <a name="vi.iv.vi.viii-Page_496"></a>unveiling the holy of holies; and in ascending order, things still holier than these, to those who are truly and not spuriously heirs of the Lords adoption. For we now dare aver (for here is the faith that is characterized by knowledge <a name="fr_3317"></a><a href="#fn_3317"><font size="1">3318</font></a>
 ) that such an one knows all things, and comprehends all things in the exercise of sure apprehension, respecting matters difficult for us, and really pertaining to the true gnosis <a name="fr_3318"></a><a href="#fn_3318"><font size="1">3319</font></a>
  such as were James, Peter, John, Paul, and the rest of the apostles. For prophecy is full of knowledge (<i>gnosis</i>), inasmuch as it was given by the Lord, and again explained by the Lord to the apostles. And is not knowledge (<i>gnosis</i>) an attribute of the rational soul, which trains itself for this, that by knowledge it may become entitled to immortality? For both are powers of the soul, both knowledge and impulse. And impulse is found to be a movement after an assent. For he who has an impulse towards an action, first receives the knowledge of the action, and secondly the impulse. Let us further devote our attention to this. For since learning is older than action; (for naturally, he who does what he wishes to do learns it first; and knowledge comes from learning, and impulse follows knowledge; after which comes action;) knowledge turns out the beginning and author of all rational action. So that rightly the peculiar nature of the rational soul is characterized by this alone; for in reality impulse, like knowledge, is excited by existing objects. And knowledge (<i>gnosis</i>) is essentially a contemplation of existences on the part of the soul, either of a certain thing or of certain things, and when perfected, of all together. Although some say that the wise man is persuaded that there are some things incomprehensible, in such wise as to have respecting them a kind of comprehension, inasmuch as he comprehends that things incomprehensible are incomprehensible; which is common, and pertains to those who are capable of perceiving little. For such a man affirms that there are some things incomprehensible.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iv.vi.viii-p25"></a>But that Gnostic of whom I speak, himself comprehends what seems to be incomprehensible to others; believing that nothing is incomprehensible to the Son of God, whence nothing incapable of being taught. For He who suffered out of His love for us, would have suppressed no element of knowledge requisite for our instruction. Accordingly this faith becomes sure demonstration; since truth follows what has been delivered by God. But if one desires extensive knowledge, “he knows things ancient, and conjectures things future; he understands knotty sayings, and the solutions of enigmas. The disciple of wisdom foreknows signs and omens, and the issues of seasons and of times.” <a name="fr_3319"></a><a href="#fn_3319"><font size="1">3320</font></a>
