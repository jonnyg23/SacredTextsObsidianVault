 <p> <a name="iii.ii.v"></a> </p><h5 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.v-p0.1"></a>Chapter V.—The Doctrine of the Christians as to the Creation of the World.</h5>  
 <p><a name="iii.ii.v-p1"></a>God was in the beginning; but the beginning, we have been taught, is the power of the Logos. For the Lord of the universe, who is Himself the necessary ground (<span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ii.v-p1.1"></a>ὑπόστασις</span>) of all being, inasmuch as no creature was yet in existence, was alone; but inasmuch as He was all power, Himself the necessary ground of things visible and invisible, with Him were all things; with Him, by Logos-power (<span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ii.v-p1.2"></a>διὰ λογικῆς δυνάμεως</span>), the Logos Himself also, who was in Him, subsists. <a name="fr_432"></a><a href="#fn_432"><font size="1">433</font></a>
  And by His simple will the Logos springs forth; and the Logos, not coming forth in vain, becomes the first-begotten work of the Father. Him (the Logos) we know to be the beginning of the world. But He came into being by participation, <a name="fr_433"></a><a href="#fn_433"><font size="1">434</font></a>
  not by abscission; for what is cut off is separated from the original substance, but that which comes by participation, making its choice of function, <a name="fr_434"></a><a href="#fn_434"><font size="1">435</font></a>
  does not render him deficient from whom it is taken. For just as from one torch many fires are lighted, but the light of the first torch is not lessened by the kindling of many torches, so the Logos, coming forth from the Logos-power of the Father, has not divested of the Logos-power Him who begat Him. I myself, for instance, talk, and you hear; yet, certainly, I who converse do not become destitute of speech (<span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ii.v-p4.4"></a>λόγος</span>) by the transmission of speech, but by the utterance of my voice I endeavour to reduce to order the unarranged matter in your minds. And as the Logos, <a name="fr_435"></a><a href="#fn_435"><font size="1">436</font></a>
  begotten in the beginning, begat in turn our world, having first created for Himself the necessary matter, so also I, in imitation of the Logos, being begotten again, <a name="fr_436"></a><a href="#fn_436"><font size="1">437</font></a>
  and having become possessed of the truth, am trying to reduce to order the confused matter which is kindred with myself. For matter is not, like God, without beginning, nor, as having no beginning, is of equal power with God; it is begotten, and not produced by any other being, but brought into existence by the Framer of all things alone.</p>

The sense, according to Otto, is that the Logos, having received a peculiar nature, shares in the <i>rational power</i> of the Father as a lighted torch partakes of the light of the torch from which it is kindled.
