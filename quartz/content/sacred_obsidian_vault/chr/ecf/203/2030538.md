  an African by nationality was, it is said, sufficiently learned in sacred literature, not wholly unacquainted with secular literature and zealous in ecclesiastical affairs. He wrote books <i>On internal war</i> and <i>Expositions of various causes</i> in which for the defence of his friends, he cites the ancient councils and from all of which <a name="fr_2601"></a><a href="#fn_2601"><font size="1">2602</font></a>
  he is recognized to have been a Donatist. He composed also eight <i>Rules for investigating and ascertaining the meaning of the Scriptures,</i> compressing them into one volume. He also expounded the Apocalypse of John entire, regarding nothing in it in a carnal sense, but all in a spiritual sense. In this exposition he maintained the angelical nature <a name="fr_2602"></a><a href="#fn_2602"><font size="1">2603</font></a>
  to be corporeal, moreover he doubts that there will be a reign of the righteous on earth for a thousand years after the resurrection, or that there will be two resurrections of the dead in the flesh, one of the righteous and the other of the unrighteous, but maintains that there will be one simultaneous resurrection of all, at which shall arise even the aborted and the deformed lest any living human being, however deformed, should be lost. He makes such distinction to be sure, between the two resurrections as to make the first, which he calls the apocalypse of the righteous, only to take place in the growth of the church where, justified by faith, they are raised from the dead bodies of their sins through baptism to the service of eternal life, but the second, the general resurrection of all men in the flesh. This man flourished at the same period with the above mentioned Rufinus during the reign of Theodosius and his sons.</p>
