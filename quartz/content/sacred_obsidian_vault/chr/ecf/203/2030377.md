 <p class="c31"><a name="v.ii.iii-p2"></a>The manuscripts of Jerome and Gennadius are numerous. The translator has seen 84 <span class="c14"><a name="v.ii.iii-p2.1"></a>mss.</span> of Jerome and 57 of Gennadius and has certain memoranda of at least 25 more and hints of still another score. It is certainly within bounds to say that there are more than 150 <span class="c14"><a name="v.ii.iii-p2.2"></a>mss.</span> of Jerome extant and not less than 100 of Gennadius.</p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="v.ii.iii-p3"></a>The oldest of those examined (and all the oldest of which he could learn were seen) are at Rome, Verona, Vercelli, Montpellier, Paris, Munich and Vienna.</p>
