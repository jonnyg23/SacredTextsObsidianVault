 </p><p class="c46"><a name="iv.x.xcvii-p1"></a>  <i>XCVII. To the Count Sporacius.</i> <a name="fr_1813"></a><a href="#fn_1813"><font size="1">1814</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c31"><a name="iv.x.xcvii-p3"></a>I am delighted with your excellencys letter. My pleasure has been increased by the very religious presbyter and monk Iamblichus, who has told me of your warm zeal, your earnestness in religion, and your real goodwill to me. On hearing of this as well as of the efforts of the glorious and pious lord <a name="page_286"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 286</font></a> <a name="iv.x.xcvii-Page_286"></a>Patricius <a name="fr_1814"></a><a href="#fn_1814"><font size="1">1815</font></a>
  on my behalf I give you the apostolic blessing which the blessed Onesiphorus obtained from that holy tongue; “The Lord give mercy to your house, for he oft refreshed. me and was not ashamed of my chain;” “The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day.” <a name="fr_1815"></a><a href="#fn_1815"><font size="1">1816</font></a>
  This I pray for you, even though the enemies of the truth inflict on me yet greater miseries as they suppose; for we have been taught to regard mens purpose; but be sure of this, that with true religion death to me is very pleasant, and exile to the ends of the earth. Still we are distressed at the storm of the churches, which the Lord of all is mighty to disperse.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iv.x.xcvii-p2"></a> Sporacius or Asporacius was present at Chalcedon in 451, as <i>comes domesticorum,</i> or one of the two commanders of the body guard. It was at his request that Theodoret wrote his <i>Hæreticarum fabularum compendium</i> which he dedicates “To the most magnificent and glorious lord Sporacius my Christ-loving son.” To Sporacius was also addressed the short treatise <i>“adversus Nestorium”</i> of which some editors have doubted the genuineness. The present letter may be dated in 449.</p>
