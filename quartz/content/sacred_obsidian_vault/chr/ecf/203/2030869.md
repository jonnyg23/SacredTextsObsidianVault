 </p><p class="c24"><a name="vi.xiii.xxi-p1"></a>  20. But, if it does not weary you, let the point out as briefly as possible, specific references to prophecy in the Gospels, that those who are being instructed in the first elements of the faith may have these testimonies written on their hearts, lest any doubt concerning the things which they believe should at any time take them by surprise. We are told in the Gospel that Judas, one of Christs friends and associates at table, betrayed Him. Let the show you how this is foretold in the Psalms: “He who hath eaten My bread hath lifted up his heel against Me:” <a name="fr_3303"></a><a href="#fn_3303"><font size="1">3304</font></a>
  and in another place; “My friends and My neighbours drew near and set themselves against Me:” <a name="fr_3304"></a><a href="#fn_3304"><font size="1">3305</font></a>
  and again; “His words were made softer than oil and yet be they very darts.” <a name="fr_3305"></a><a href="#fn_3305"><font size="1">3306</font></a>
  What then is meant by his words were made soft? “Judas came to Jesus and said unto Him, Hail, Master, and kissed Him.” <a name="fr_3306"></a><a href="#fn_3306"><font size="1">3307</font></a>
  Thus through the soft blandishment of a kiss he implanted the execrable dart of betrayal. On which the Lord said to him, “Judas, betrayest thou the Son of Man with a kiss?” <a name="fr_3307"></a><a href="#fn_3307"><font size="1">3308</font></a>
  You observe that He was appraised by the traitors covetousness at thirty pieces of silver. Of this also the Prophet speaks, “And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my price, or if not, forbear;” and presently, “I received from them,” he says, “thirty pieces of silver, and I cast them into the house of the Lord, into the foundry.” <a name="fr_3308"></a><a href="#fn_3308"><font size="1">3309</font></a>
  Is not this what is written in the Gospels, that Judas, “repenting of what he had done, brought back the money, and threw it down in the temple and departed?” <a name="fr_3309"></a><a href="#fn_3309"><font size="1">3310</font></a>
  Well did He call it His price, as though blaming and upbraiding. For He had done so many good works among them, He had given sight to the blind, feet to the lame, the power of walking to the palsied, life also to the dead; for all these good works they paid Him death as His price, appraised at thirty pieces of silver. It is related also in the Gospels that He was bound. This also the word of prophecy had foretold by Isaiah, saying, “Woe unto their soul, who have devised a most evil device against themselves, saying, Let us bind the just One, seeing that He is unprofitable to us.” <a name="fr_3310"></a><a href="#fn_3310"><font size="1">3311</font></a>
