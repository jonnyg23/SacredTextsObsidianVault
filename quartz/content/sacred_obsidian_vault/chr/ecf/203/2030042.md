 </p><p class="c46"><a name="iv.viii.i.xxii-p1"></a>  <span class="c12"><a name="iv.viii.i.xxii-p1.1"></a>Chapter XXI</span>.—<i>Bishops of Heretical opinions ordained in Antioch after the Banishment of St. Eustathius</i> <a name="fr_410"></a><a href="#fn_410"><font size="1">411</font></a>
 .</p>  
 <p class="c31"><a name="iv.viii.i.xxii-p3"></a><span class="c12"><a name="iv.viii.i.xxii-p3.1"></a>Eulalius</span> was first consecrated in place of Eustathius. But Eulalius surviving his elevation only a short period, it was intended that Eusebius of Palestine should be translated to this bishopric. Eusebius, however, refused the appointment, and the emperor forbade its being conferred on him. Next Euphronius was put forward, who also dying, after a lapse of only one year and a few months, the see was conferred on Flaccillus <a name="fr_411"></a><a href="#fn_411"><font size="1">412</font></a>
 . All these bishops secretly clung to the Arian heresy. Hence it was that most of those individuals, whether of the clergy or of the laity, who valued the true religion, left the churches and formed assemblies among themselves. They were called Eustathians, since it was after the banishment of Eustathius that they began to hold their meetings. The wretched woman above-mentioned was soon after attacked by a severe and protracted illness, and then avowed the imposture in which she had been engaged, and made known the whole plot, not only to two or three, but to a very large number of priests. She confessed that she had been bribed to bring this false and impudent charge, but yet that her <a name="page_58"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 58</font></a> <a name="iv.viii.i.xxii-Page_58"></a>oath was not altogether false, as a certain Eustathius, a coppersmith, was the father of the babe. Such were some of the crimes perpetrated in Antioch by this most excellent faction.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iv.viii.i.xxii-p2"></a> Socrates, H E. i. 24, says that on the deposition of Eustathius “<span class="Greek"><a name="iv.viii.i.xxii-p2.1"></a>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><a name="iv.viii.i.xxii-p2.2"></a>φεξῆς ἐπὶ ἔτη ὀκτὼ λέγεται τὸν ἐν ᾽Αντιοχεί&amp; 139· θρόνον τῆς ἐκκλησίας σχολάσαι ὀψὲ δὲ</span><span class="Greek"><a name="iv.viii.i.xxii-p2.3"></a>…</span><span class="Greek"><a name="iv.viii.i.xxii-p2.4"></a>χειροτονεῖται Εὐφρόνιος</span>.” Cf. Soz. H.E. ii. 19. There is much confusion about this succession of bishops. Jerome (Chron. ii. p. 92) gives the names of the Arian bishops thrust in succession into the place of Eustathius, as Eulalius, Eusebius, Eufronius, Placillus. “Perhaps Eulalius was put forward for the vacant see, like Eusebius, but never actually appointed.” Bp. Lightfoot, Dict. Christ. Biog. ii. 315.</p>
