 </span> of Africa, bishop of Hipporegensis, a man renowned throughout the world for learning both sacred and secular, unblemished in the faith, pure in life, wrote works so many that they cannot all be gathered. For who is there that can boast himself of having all his works, or who reads with such diligence as to read all he has written? <a name="fr_2636"></a><a href="#fn_2636"><font size="1">2637</font></a>
  As an old man even, he published fifteen books <i>On the Trinity</i> which he had begun as a young man. In which, as scripture says, brought into the chamber of the king and adorned with the manifold garment of the wisdom of God, he exhibited a church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing. In his work <i>On the incarnation of the Lord</i> also he manifested a peculiar piety. On the resurrection of the dead he wrote with equal sincerity, and left it to the less able to raise doubts respecting abortions. <a name="fr_2637"></a><a href="#fn_2637"><font size="1">2638</font></a>
