 </span> who lived at a period not far from the Apostolic age, writing a <i>History</i> of all ecclesiastical events from the passion of our Lord, down to his own period, and gathering many things useful to the reader, composed five volumes in simple style, trying to represent the style of speaking of those whose lives he treated. He says that he went to Rome in the time of Anicetus, the tenth bishop after Peter, and continued there till the time of Eleutherius, bishop of the same city, who had been formerly deacon under Anicetus. Moreover, arguing against idols, he wrote a history, showing from what error they had first arisen, and this work indicates in what age he flourished. <a name="fr_2417"></a><a href="#fn_2417"><font size="1">2418</font></a>
  He says, “They built monuments and temples to their dead as we see up to the present day, <a name="fr_2418"></a><a href="#fn_2418"><font size="1">2419</font></a>
  such as the one to Antinous, servant to the Emperor Hadrian, in whose honour also games were celebrated, and a city founded bearing his name, and a temple with priests established.” The Emperor Hadrian is said to have been enamoured of Antinous.</p>
