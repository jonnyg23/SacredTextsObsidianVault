 </p><p class="c46"><a name="iv.viii.i.xxxiii-p1"></a>  <span class="c12"><a name="iv.viii.i.xxxiii-p1.1"></a>Chapter XXXII</span>.—<i>The End of the Holy Emperor Constantine</i>.</p>  
 <p class="c31"><a name="iv.viii.i.xxxiii-p2"></a><span class="c12"><a name="iv.viii.i.xxxiii-p2.1"></a>The</span> emperor was now translated from his earthly dominions to a better kingdom <a name="fr_445"></a><a href="#fn_445"><font size="1">446</font></a>
 .</p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="iv.viii.i.xxxiii-p4"></a>The body of the emperor was enclosed in a golden coffin, and was carried to Constantinople by the governors of the provinces, the military commanders, and the other officers of state, preceded and followed by the whole army, all bitterly deploring their loss; for Constantine had been as an affectionate father to them all. The body of the emperor was allowed to remain in the palace until the arrival of his sons, and high honours were rendered to it. But these details require no description here, as a full account has been given by other writers. From their works, which are easy of access, may be learnt how greatly the Ruler of all honours His faithful servants. If any one should be tempted to unbelief, let him look at what occurs now near the tomb and the statue of Constantine <a name="fr_446"></a><a href="#fn_446"><font size="1">447</font></a>
 , and then he must admit the truth of what God has said in the Scriptures, “<i>Them that honour Me I will honour, and they that despise Me shall be lightly esteemed</i> <a name="fr_447"></a><a href="#fn_447"><font size="1">448</font></a>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iv.viii.i.xxxiii-p5"></a> Valesius explains this allusion by quoting the Arian Philostorgius (ii. 17), who says that “the statue of Constantine, standing on its porphyry column, was honoured with sacrifices, illuminations, and incense.” The accusation of idolatrous worship may be disregarded. Cf. Chron. Alex. 665, 667.</p>
