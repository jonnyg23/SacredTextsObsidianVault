 </p><p class="c46"><a name="iv.x.xiii-p1"></a>  <i>XIII. To Cyrus.</i></p>  
 <p class="c31"><a name="iv.x.xiii-p2"></a>I had heard of the island of Lesbos, and its cities Mitylene, Methymna, and the rest; but I was ignorant of the fruit of the vine cultivated in it. <a name="fr_1627"></a><a href="#fn_1627"><font size="1">1628</font></a>
  Now, thanks to your diligence, I have become acquainted with it, and I admire both its whiteness and the delicacy of its flavour. Perhaps time may even improve it, unless it turns it sour; for wine, like the body, and plants, and buildings, and other things made by hand, is damaged by time. If, as you say, it makes the drinker longlived, I am afraid it will be of little use to me, for I have no desire to live a long life, when lifes storms are so many and so hard.</p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="iv.x.xiii-p4"></a>I was however much pleased to hear of the health of the monk. Really my anxiety about him was quite distressing, and I wrongly blamed the doctors, for his complaint required the treatment they gave. I have sent you a little pot of honey which the Cilician bees make from storax flowers.</p>
