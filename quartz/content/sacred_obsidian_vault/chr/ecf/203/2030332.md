 <p class="c31"><a name="iv.x.cxliii-p2"></a>I have already addressed your reverence in another letter, and have delivered it to your much respected brethren. Now again I address your holiness. I am induced to do so both by your admirable life, and by the praiseworthy zeal which you have shewn on behalf of the apostolic faith, fearless alike of imperial power and of episcopal combination. For granted that the majority of the council consented under coercion, still they did confirm the new fangled heresy by their signatures. Your holiness, however, was shaken by none of these things, but abided by the ancient doctrines which the Lord, by means of both the prophets and the apostles, has taught the churches to hold. These decrees I pray that I may preserve, and keep to the end my faith and confession in one Father, one Son and one Holy Ghost. For the incarnation of the only begotten made no addition to the number of the Trinity. Even after the incarnation the Trinity is still a Trinity. This is the teaching I have received from the beginning; this has been my faith; in this was I baptized; this have I preached; in this have I baptized, this I continue to hold. Of them that utter a lie about the Father the Lord has said “When he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own,” <a name="fr_1991"></a><a href="#fn_1991"><font size="1">1992</font></a>
  for what is said of the teacher is appropriate to the disciples. So these men who employ lies against me speak of their own, and do not describe what is mine. I am comforted by my Masters words “Blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner <a name="page_310"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 310</font></a> <a name="iv.x.cxliii-Page_310"></a>of evil against you falsely for my sake. Rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven.” <a name="fr_1992"></a><a href="#fn_1992"><font size="1">1993</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="iv.x.cxliii-p5"></a>I entreat your piety to pray that I may not have my part among the wrong doers, but among them that suffer wrong on account of the truth of the Gospels.</p>
