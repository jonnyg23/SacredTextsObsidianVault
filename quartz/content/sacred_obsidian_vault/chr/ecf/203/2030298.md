 <p> <a name="iv.x.cix"></a>
 </p><p class="c46"><a name="iv.x.cix-p1"></a>  <i>CIX. To Eusebius, Bishop of Ancyra.</i> <a name="fr_1844"></a><a href="#fn_1844"><font size="1">1845</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c31"><a name="iv.x.cix-p3"></a>Many are the devices secretly plotted against me, and through me patched up against the faith of apostles. I am however comforted by the sufferings of the Saints, Prophets, Apostles, Martyrs, and men famous in the churches in the word of Grace; and besides these by the promises of our God and Saviour, for in this present life He has promised us nothing pleasant or delightful, but rather trouble, toil, and peril, and attacks of enemies. “In the world,” He says, “ye shall have tribulation,” <a name="fr_1845"></a><a href="#fn_1845"><font size="1">1846</font></a>
  and “if they have persecuted me they will also persecute you,” <a name="fr_1846"></a><a href="#fn_1846"><font size="1">1847</font></a>
  and “If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub how much more shall they call them of his household,” <a name="fr_1847"></a><a href="#fn_1847"><font size="1">1848</font></a>
  and “The time cometh when whosoever killeth you will think he doeth God service,” <a name="fr_1848"></a><a href="#fn_1848"><font size="1">1849</font></a>
  and “Straight is the gate and narrow the way which leadeth unto life,” <a name="fr_1849"></a><a href="#fn_1849"><font size="1">1850</font></a>
  and “When they persecute you in this city flee you into another,” <a name="fr_1850"></a><a href="#fn_1850"><font size="1">1851</font></a>
  and I might quote all similar passages. The divine Apostle too speaks in the same strain. “Yea and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution, but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.” <a name="fr_1851"></a><a href="#fn_1851"><font size="1">1852</font></a>
  These words give me the greatest comfort in this distress. As the calumnies uttered against me have probably reached your holinesss ears, I beseech your holiness to give no credence to the lies of my slanderers. I am not aware of ever having taught anyone up to the present time to believe in two sons. I have been taught to believe in one only begotten, our Lord Jesus Christ, God the Word made man. But I know the distinction between flesh and Godhead, and regard as impious all who divide our one Lord Jesus Christ into two sons, as well as those who, travelling in an opposite direction, call the Godhead and manhood of the master Christ one nature. For these exaggerations stand opposed to one another, while between them lies the way of the doctrines of the Gospel, beautified by the footprints of prophets and apostles, and of all who after them have been conspicuous for the gift of teaching. I was anxious to adduce their opinions, and to point out how they bear witness in favour of my own, but I want more words than a letter allows room for, wherefore I have written summarily what I have been taught about the incarnation of the only begotten; I send my statement to your godly excellency. <a name="fr_1852"></a><a href="#fn_1852"><font size="1">1853</font></a>
  I have written not with the object of teaching others, but of making my defence against the accusations brought against me, and of explaining my sentiments to those who are ignorant of them. After your holiness has read what I have written, if you find it in conformity with the apostolic doctrines, I hope you will confirm my opinion by what you reply—if, on the contrary, anything that I have said jars with the divine teaching, I request to be told of it by your holiness. For, though I have spent much time in teaching, I still need one to teach me. “We know,” says the divine Apostle “in part,” <a name="fr_1853"></a><a href="#fn_1853"><font size="1">1854</font></a>
  and again he says, “If any man think that he knoweth anything he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.” <a name="fr_1854"></a><a href="#fn_1854"><font size="1">1855</font></a>
  So I hope that I may hear the truth from your holiness, and that you may also give heed to the calm of the Church, and fight for the divine doctrines. It is for their sakes that the very godly bishops, making light of the difficulties of the journey, and of the winter, have set out for the imperial city, in the <a name="page_290"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 290</font></a> <a name="iv.x.cix-Page_290"></a>endeavour to bring about some end to the storm. Send them I pray you, on their way with your prayers and with your prayers too strengthen me. <a name="fr_1855"></a><a href="#fn_1855"><font size="1">1856</font></a>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iv.x.cix-p14"></a> The route of the bishops would be by land, in consequence of the dangers of the sea voyage in winter time. From Ancyra (Angora) they would follow the course of the Sangarius into Bithynia, and would cross thence via Chalcedon to Constantinople.</p>
