 <p class="c31"><a name="iv.x.cvii-p2"></a>The struggles which your piety has undergone on behalf of the apostolic doctrines are not unknown, but are frequently mentioned alike by those who have known them by experience, and by others who have heard of them from these. Continue, my dear sir, your efforts, and fight for the doctrines of the Fathers. For these I too am <a name="page_289"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 289</font></a> <a name="iv.x.cvii-Page_289"></a>buffeted in all directions and, while I receive the shock of the great waves, I beseech our Governor either to nod his head and scatter the tempest, or enable the victims of the storm by His grace to play the man.</p>
