 </p><p class="c46"><a name="iv.viii.i.xiii-p1"></a>  <span class="c12"><a name="iv.viii.i.xiii-p1.1"></a>Chapter XII</span>.—<i>Confutation of the blasphemies of the Arians of our time, from the writings of Eusebius, Bishop of Cæsarea</i>.</p>  
 <p class="c31"><a name="iv.viii.i.xiii-p2"></a><span class="c12"><a name="iv.viii.i.xiii-p2.1"></a>Eusebius</span> clearly testifies that the aforesaid term “consubstantial” is not a new one, nor the invention of the fathers assembled at the council; but that, from the very first <a name="fr_372"></a><a href="#fn_372"><font size="1">373</font></a>
  it has been handed down from father to son. He states that all those then assembled unanimously received the creed then published; and he again bears testimony to the same fact in another work, in which he highly extols the conduct of the great Constantine. He writes as follows <a name="fr_373"></a><a href="#fn_373"><font size="1">374</font></a>
 :—</p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="iv.viii.i.xiii-p5"></a>“The emperor having delivered this discourse in Latin, it was translated into Greek by an interpreter, and then he gave liberty of speech to the leaders of the council. Some at once began to bring forward complaints against their neighbours, while others had recourse to recriminations and reproaches. Each party had much to urge, and at the beginning the debate waxed very violent. The emperor patiently and attentively listened to all that was advanced, and gave full attention to what was urged by each party in turn. He calmly endeavoured to reconcile the conflicting parties; addressing them mildly in Greek, of which language he was not ignorant, in a sweet and gentle manner. Some he convinced by argument, others he put to the blush; he commended those who had spoken well, and excited all to unanimity; until, at length, he reduced them all to oneness of mind and opinion on all the disputed points, so that they all agreed to hold the same faith, and to celebrate the festival of Salvation upon the same day. What had been decided was committed to writing, and was signed by all the bishops.”</p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="iv.viii.i.xiii-p6"></a>Soon after the author thus continues the narrative:—</p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="iv.viii.i.xiii-p7"></a>“When matters had been thus arranged, the emperor gave them permission to return to their own dioceses. They returned with great joy, and have ever since continued to be of the one opinion, agreed upon in the presence of the emperor, and, though once widely separated, now united together, as it were, in one body. Constantine, rejoicing in the success of his efforts, made known these happy results by letter to those who were at a distance. He ordered large sums of money to be liberally distributed both among the inhabitants of the country and of the cities, in order that the twentieth anniversary of his reign might be celebrated with public festivities.”</p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="iv.viii.i.xiii-p8"></a>Although the Arians impiously gainsay the statements of the other fathers, yet they ought to believe what has been written by this father, whom they have been accustomed to admire. They ought, therefore, to receive his testimony to the unanimity with which the confession of faith was signed by all. But, since they impugn the opinions of their own leaders, they ought to become acquainted with the most foul and terrible manner of the death of Arius and with all their powers to flee from the impious doctrine of which he was the parent. As it is likely that the mode of his death is not known by all, I shall here relate it.</p>
