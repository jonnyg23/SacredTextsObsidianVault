 <p> <a name="iv.x.lii"></a>
 </p><p class="c46"><a name="iv.x.lii-p1"></a>  <i>LII. To Ibas, Bishop of Edessa</i>. <a name="fr_1697"></a><a href="#fn_1697"><font size="1">1698</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c31"><a name="iv.x.lii-p3"></a>It is, I think, of His providential care for our common salvation that the God of all brings on some men certain calamities, that chastisement may prove to be to them that have erred a healing remedy; to virtues athletes an encouragement to constancy; and to all who look on a beneficial exemplar. For it is natural that when we see others punished we should be filled with fear ourselves. In view of these considerations I look on the trouble of Africa as a general advantage. In the first place when I bear in mind their former prosperity and now look on their sudden overthrow, I see how variable are all human affairs, and learn a twofold lesson;—not to rejoice in felicity as though it would never come to an end, nor be distressed at calamities as hard to bear. Then I recall the memory of past errors, and tremble lest I fall into like sufferings. My main motive in now writing to you is to introduce to your holiness the very God-<a name="page_267"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 267</font></a> <a name="iv.x.lii-Page_267"></a>beloved bishop Cyprianus, <a name="fr_1698"></a><a href="#fn_1698"><font size="1">1699</font></a>
  who starting from the famous Africa is now compelled, by the savagery of the barbarians, to travel in foreign lands.</p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="iv.x.lii-p5"></a>He has brought a letter to us from the very holy bishop the lord Eusebius, <a name="fr_1699"></a><a href="#fn_1699"><font size="1">1700</font></a>
  who wisely rules the Galatians. When your piety has received him with your wonted kindness I beg you to send him with a letter to whatever pious bishops you may think fit so that while he enjoys their kindly consolation he may be the means of their receiving heavenly and lasting benefits.</p>
