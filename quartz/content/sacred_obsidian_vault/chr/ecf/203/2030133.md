 </p><p class="c46"><a name="iv.viii.iv.xxvii-p1"></a>  <span class="c12"><a name="iv.viii.iv.xxvii-p1.1"></a>Chapter XXVII</span>.—<i>Of what bishops were at this time distinguished in Asia and Pontus.</i></p>  
 <p class="c31"><a name="iv.viii.iv.xxvii-p2"></a><span class="c12"><a name="iv.viii.iv.xxvii-p2.1"></a>Among</span> the bishops were the two Gregorii, the one of Nazianzus <a name="fr_795"></a><a href="#fn_795"><font size="1">796</font></a>
  and the other of Nyssa, <a name="fr_796"></a><a href="#fn_796"><font size="1">797</font></a>
  the latter the brother and the former the friend and fellow worker of the great Basilius. These were foremost champions of piety in Cappadocia; and in front rank with them was Peter, born of the same parents with Basilius and Gregorius, who though not having received like them a foreign education, like them lived a life of brilliant distinction.</p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="iv.viii.iv.xxvii-p5"></a>In Pisidia Optimus, <a name="fr_797"></a><a href="#fn_797"><font size="1">798</font></a>
  in Lycaonia Amphilochius, <a name="fr_798"></a><a href="#fn_798"><font size="1">799</font></a>
  fought in the front rank on behalf of their fathers faith, and repelled the enemies assaults.</p>  
 <p class="c24"><a name="iv.viii.iv.xxvii-p8"></a>In the West Damasus, <a name="fr_799"></a><a href="#fn_799"><font size="1">800</font></a>
  Bishop of Rome, and Ambrosius, entrusted with the government of Milan, smote those who attacked them from afar. In conjunction with these, bishops forced to dwell in remote regions, confirmed their friends and undid their foes by writings—thus pilots able to cope with the greatness of the storm were granted by the governor of the universe. Against the violence of the foe He set in battle array the virtue of His captains, and provided means meet to ward off the troubles of these difficult times, and not only were the churches granted this kind of protection by their loving Lord, but deemed worthy of yet another kind of guidance.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iv.viii.iv.xxvii-p3"></a> Gregorius of Nazianzus (in Cappadocia, on the Halys) was so called not as bishop of Nazianzus. He was bishop successively of Sasima, “a detestable little village,”—(Carm. xi. 439–446)—and of Constantinople, and was called “Nazianzenus” because his father and namesake was bishop of that see. On his acting as bishop at Nazianzus after his withdrawal from Constantinople, vide note on page 136.</p>
