 <p class="c31"><a name="iv.viii.v.xiv-p2"></a><span class="c12"><a name="iv.viii.v.xiv-p2.1"></a>After</span> a considerable time Maximus <a name="fr_865"></a><a href="#fn_865"><font size="1">866</font></a>
  was informed of the attacks which were being made upon the loud-voiced herald of the truth, and he sent dispatches to Valentinianus charging him to put a stop to his war against true religion and exhorting him not to abandon his fathers faith. In the event of his advice being disregarded he further threatened war, and confirmed what he wrote by what he did, <a name="fr_866"></a><a href="#fn_866"><font size="1">867</font></a>
  for he mustered his forces and marched for Milan where Valentinianus was then residing. When the latter heard of his approach he fled into Illyri<a name="page_142"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 142</font></a> <a name="iv.viii.v.xiv-Page_142"></a>cum. <a name="fr_867"></a><a href="#fn_867"><font size="1">868</font></a>
  He had learnt by experience what good he had got by following his mothers advice.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iv.viii.v.xiv-p4"></a> The motives here stated seem to have had little to do with the march of Maximus over the Alps. Indeed so far from enthusiasm for Ambrose and the Ambrosian view of the faith being conspicuous in the invader, he had received the bishop at Treves as envoy from Valentinian, had refused to be diverted from his purpose, and had moreover taken offence at the objection of Ambrose to communicate with the bishops who had been concerned in the first capital punishment of a heretic—i.e. Priscillian.</p>
