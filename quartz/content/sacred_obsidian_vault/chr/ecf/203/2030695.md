 </p><p class="c24"><a name="vi.xi.iii.xi-p1"></a>  10. You chose a bad introducer. If you will take my counsel, both you and I will by preference turn to him who introduces us to the Father and who  said <a name="fr_2951"></a><a href="#fn_2951"><font size="1">2952</font></a>
  No man cometh unto the Father but by me. I lament for you, my brother, if you believe this; and if you believe it not, I still lament that you hunt through all sorts of ancient and antiquated documents for grounds for suspecting other men of perjury, while perjury, lasting and endless with all its inexplicable impiety, remains upon your own lips. Might not these words of the Apostle be rightly applied to  you: <a name="fr_2952"></a><a href="#fn_2952"><font size="1">2953</font></a>
  “Thou that art called a Jew and restest in the law, and makest thy boast in God, being instructed out of the law, and trustest that thou thyself art a leader of the blind, a light of them that sit in darkness, an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, who hast a form of knowledge and of the truth in the law: Thou therefore, that teachest others, teachest thou not thyself? Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? Thou that preachest that a man should not steal, dost thou steal? Thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege”—that is perjury? And, what comes last and most important, “The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you,” and your love of strife.</p>
