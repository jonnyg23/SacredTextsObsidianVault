 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.iv.ii-p2"></a>(Is for Amphilochius, written at the same time and in consequence of the same trouble as that which we have placed second of the letters to Cæsarius.)</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.iv.ii-p3"></a>As we know gold and stones by their look, so too we may distinguish good men from bad in the same way, and do not need a very long trial.  For I should not have needed many words in pleading for my most honourable son Amphilochius with Your Magnanimity.  I should rather have expected some strange and incredible thing to happen than that he would do anything dishonourable, or think of such a thing, in a matter of money; such a universal reputation has he as a gentleman, and as wiser than his years.  But what must he suffer?  Nothing escapes envy, for some word of blame has touched even him, a man who has fallen under accusation of crime through simplicity rather than depravity of disposition.  But do not allow it to be tolerable to you to overlook him in his vexations and trouble.  Not so, I entreat your sacred and great mind, but honour your country <a name="fr_4746"></a><a href="#fn_4746"><font size="1">4747</font></a>
  and aid his virtue, and have a respect for me who have attained to glory by and through you; and be everything to this man, adding the will to the power, for I know that there is nothing of equal power with Your Excellency.</p>
