 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.viii.iv-p2"></a>(Gregory put a collection of Basils letters with his own, and gave them the first place.  Nicobulus seems to have been surprised at this, and asked the reason.  Gregory explains as follows.)</p>  
 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.viii.iv-p3"></a>I have always preferred the Great Basil to myself, though he was of the contrary opinion; and so I do now, not less for truths sake than for friendships.  This is the reason why I have given his letters the first place and my own the second.  For I hope we two will always be coupled together; and also I would supply others with an example of modesty and submission.</p>
