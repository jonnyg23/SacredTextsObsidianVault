 <p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.iv.vi-p3"></a>Our retreat and leisure and quiet have about them something very agreeable to me; but the fact that they cut me off from your friendship and society is not so advantageous but rather the other way.  Others enjoy your Perfection, to me it would be really a great boon if I might have just that shadow of conversation which comes in a letter.  Shall I see you again?  Shall I embrace again him of whom I am so proud, and shall this be granted to the remnant of my life?  If so, all thanks to God:  if not, the best part of my life is over.  Pray remember your friend Gregory and pray for him.</p>
