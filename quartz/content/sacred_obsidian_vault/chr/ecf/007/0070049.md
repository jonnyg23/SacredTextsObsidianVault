 <p> <a name="iii.ii.ii.xix"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.ii.xix-p0.1"></a>Chap. XIX.—Of the Worship of Images and Earthly Objects.</h4>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.ii.xix-p1"></a>Whoever, therefore, is anxious to observe the obligations to which man is liable, and to maintain a regard for his nature, let him raise himself from the ground, and, with mind lifted up, let him direct his eyes to heaven: let him not seek God under his feet, nor dig up from his footprints an object of veneration, for whatever lies beneath man must necessarily be inferior to man; but let him seek it aloft, let him seek it in the highest place: for nothing can be greater than man, except that which is above man. But God is greater than man: therefore He is above, and <a name="page_68"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 68</font></a> <a name="iii.ii.ii.xix-Page_68"></a>not below; nor is He to be sought in the lowest, but rather in the highest region. Wherefore it is undoubted that there is no religion wherever there is an image. <a name="fr_357"></a><a href="#fn_357"><font size="1">358</font></a>
  For if religion consists of divine things, and there is nothing divine except in heavenly things; it follows that images are without religion, because there can be nothing heavenly in that which is made from the earth. And this, indeed, may be plain to a wise man from the very name. <a name="fr_358"></a><a href="#fn_358"><font size="1">359</font></a>
  For whatever is an imitation, that must of necessity be false; nor can anything receive the name of a true object which counterfeits the truth by deception and imitation. But if all imitation is not particularly a serious matter, but as it were a sport and jest, then there is no religion in images, but a mimicry of religion. That which is true is therefore to be preferred to all things which are false; earthly things are to be trampled upon, that we may obtain heavenly things. For this is the state of the case, that whosoever shall prostrate his soul, which has its origin from heaven, to the shades <a name="fr_359"></a><a href="#fn_359"><font size="1">360</font></a>
  beneath, and the lowest things, must fall to that place to which he has cast himself. Therefore he ought to be mindful of his nature and condition, and always to strive and aim at things above. And whoever shall do this, he will be judged altogether wise, he just, he a man: he, in short, will be judged worthy of heaven whom his Parent will recognise not as abject, nor cast down to the earth after the manner of the beasts, <a name="fr_360"></a><a href="#fn_360"><font size="1">361</font></a>
  but rather standing and upright as He made him.  </p>
