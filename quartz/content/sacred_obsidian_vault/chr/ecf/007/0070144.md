 <p> <a name="iii.ii.vi.vi"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.vi.vi-p0.1"></a>Chap. VI.—Of the Chief Good and Virtue, and or Knowledge and Righteousness.</h4>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vi.vi-p1"></a>I have said that which was the first thing, that the knowledge of good is not virtue; and secondly, I have shown what virtue is, and in what it consists. It follows that I should show this also, that the philosophers were ignorant of what is good and evil; and this briefly, because it has been almost <a name="fr_1112"></a><a href="#fn_1112"><font size="1">1113</font></a>
  made plain in the third book, when I was discussing the subject of the chief good. And because they did not know what the chief good was, they necessarily erred in the case of the other goods and evils which are not the chief; for no one can weigh these with a true judgment who does not possess the fountain itself from which they are derived. Now the source of good things is God; but of evils, he who is always the enemy of the divine name, of whom we have often spoken. From these two sources good and evil things have their origin. Those which proceed from God have this object, to procure immortality, which is the greatest good; but those which arise from the other have this office, to call man away from heavenly things and sink him in earthly things, and thus to consign him to the punishment of everlasting death, which is the greatest evil. Is it therefore doubtful but that all those were ignorant of what was good and evil, who neither knew God nor the adversary of God? Therefore they referred the end of good things to the body, and to this short life, which must be dissolved and perish: they did not advance further. But all their precepts, and all the things which they introduce as goods, adhere to the earth, and lie on the ground, since they die with the body, which is earth; for they do not tend to procure life for man, but either to the acquisition or increase of riches, honour, glory, and power, which are altogether mortal things, as much so indeed as he who has laboured to obtain them. Hence is that saying, <a name="fr_1113"></a><a href="#fn_1113"><font size="1">1114</font></a>
  “It is virtue to know the end of an object <a name="fr_1114"></a><a href="#fn_1114"><font size="1">1115</font></a>
  to be sought, and the means of procuring it;” for they enjoin by what means and by what practices property is to be sought, for they see that it is often sought unjustly. But virtue of this kind is not proposed to the wise man; for it is not virtue to seek riches, of which neither the finding nor the possession is in our power: therefore they are more easy to be gained and to be retained by the bad than by the good. Virtue, then, cannot consist in the seeking of those things in the despising of which the force and purport of virtue appears; nor will it have recourse to those very things which, with its great and lofty mind, it desires to trample upon and bruise under foot; nor is it lawful for a soul which is earnestly fixed on heavenly goods to be called away from its immortal pursuits, that it may acquire for itself these frail things. But the course <a name="fr_1115"></a><a href="#fn_1115"><font size="1">1116</font></a>
  of virtue especially consists in the acquisition of those things which neither any man, nor death itself, can take away from us. Since these things are so, that which follows is true: “It is virtue to be able to assign their value to riches:” which verse is nearly of the same meaning as the first two. But neither he nor any of the philosophers was able to know the price itself, either of what nature or what it is; for the poet, and all those whom he followed, thought that it meant to make a right use of riches,—that is, to be moderate in living, not to make costly entertainments, not to squander carelessly, not to expend property on superfluous or disgraceful objects. <a name="fr_1116"></a><a href="#fn_1116"><font size="1">1117</font></a>
    </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vi.vi-p7"></a>Some one will perhaps say, What do you say? Do you deny that this is virtue? I do not deny it indeed; for if I should deny it, I should appear to prove the opposite. But I deny that it is true virtue; because it is not that heavenly principle, but is altogether of the earth, since it produces no effect but that which remains on the earth. <a name="fr_1117"></a><a href="#fn_1117"><font size="1">1118</font></a>
  But what it is to make a right use of wealth, and what advantage is to be sought from riches, I will declare more openly when I shall begin to speak of the duty of piety. Now the other things which follow are by no means true; for to proclaim enmity against the wicked, or to undertake the defence of the good, may be common to it with the evil. For some, by a pretence of goodness, prepare the way for themselves to power, and do many things which the good are accustomed to do, and that the more readily because they do them for the sake of deceiving; and I wish that it were as easy to carry out goodness in action as it is to pretend to it. But when they have begun to attain to their purpose and their wish in reaching the highest step of power, then, truly laying aside pretence, these men discover their character; they seize upon everything, and offer violence, and lay waste; and they press upon the good themselves, whose cause they had undertaken; and they cut away the steps by which they mounted, that no one <a name="page_169"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 169</font></a> <a name="iii.ii.vi.vi-Page_169"></a>may be able to imitate them against themselves. But, however, let us suppose that this duty of defending the good belongs only to the good man. Yet to undertake it is easy, to fulfil it is difficult; because when you have committed yourself to a contest and an encounter, the victory is placed at the disposal of God, not in your own power. And for the most part the wicked are more powerful both in number and in combination than the good, so that it is not so much virtue which is necessary to overcome them as good fortune. Is any one ignorant how often the better and the juster side has been overcome? From this cause harsh tyrannies have always broken out against the citizens. All history is full of examples, but we will be content with one. <a name="iii.ii.vi.vi-p8.4"></a>Cnœus Pompeius wished to be the defender of the good, since he took up arms in defence of the commonwealth, in defence of the senate, and in defence of liberty; and yet the same man, being conquered, perished together with liberty itself, <a name="fr_1118"></a><a href="#fn_1118"><font size="1">1119</font></a>
  and being mutilated by Egyptian eunuchs, was cast forth unburied. <a name="fr_1119"></a><a href="#fn_1119"><font size="1">1120</font></a>
    </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vi.vi-p11"></a>It is not virtue, therefore, either to be the enemy of the bad or the defender of the good, because virtue cannot be subject to uncertain chances.  </p>  <blockquote><a name="iii.ii.vi.vi-p11.1"></a>   “Moreover, to reckon the interests of our country as in the first place.”<br>  </blockquote>  
 <p class="Continue"><a name="iii.ii.vi.vi-p12"></a>When the agreement of men is taken away, virtue has no existence at all; for what are the interests of our country, but the inconveniences of another state or nation?—that is, to extend the boundaries which are violently taken from others, to increase the power of the state, to improve the revenues,—all which things are not virtues, but the overthrowing of virtues: for, in the first place, the union of human society is taken away, innocence is taken away, the abstaining from the property of another is taken away; lastly, justice itself is taken away, which is unable to bear the tearing asunder of the human race, and wherever arms have glittered, must be banished and exterminated from thence. This saying of <a name="iii.ii.vi.vi-p12.1"></a>Cicero <a name="fr_1120"></a><a href="#fn_1120"><font size="1">1121</font></a>
  is true: “But they who say that regard is to be had to citizens, but that it is not to be had to foreigners, these destroy the common society of the human race; and when this is removed, beneficence, liberality, kindness, and justice are entirely <a name="fr_1121"></a><a href="#fn_1121"><font size="1">1122</font></a>
  taken away.” For how can a man be just who injures, who hates, who despoils, who puts to death? And they who strive to be serviceable to their country do all these things: for they are ignorant of what this being serviceable is, who think nothing useful, nothing advantageous, but that which can be held by the hand; and this alone cannot be held, because it may be snatched away.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vi.vi-p15"></a>Whoever, then, has gained for his country these goods—as they themselves call them—that is, who by the overthrow of cities and the destruction of nations has filled the treasury with money, has taken lands and enriched his country-men—he is extolled with praises to the heaven: in him there is said to be the greatest and perfect virtue. And this is the error not only of the people and the ignorant, but also of philosophers, who even give precepts for injustice, lest folly and wickedness should be wanting in discipline and authority. Therefore, when they are speaking of the duties relating to warfare, all that discourse is accommodated neither to justice nor to true virtue, but to this life and to civil institutions; <a name="fr_1122"></a><a href="#fn_1122"><font size="1">1123</font></a>
  and that this is not justice the matter itself declares, and <a name="iii.ii.vi.vi-p16.2"></a>Cicero has testified. <a name="fr_1123"></a><a href="#fn_1123"><font size="1">1124</font></a>
  “But we,” he says, “are not in possession of the real and life-like figure of true law and genuine justice, we have nothing but delineations and sketches; <a name="fr_1124"></a><a href="#fn_1124"><font size="1">1125</font></a>
  and I wish that we followed even these, for they are taken from the excellent copies made by nature and truth.” It is then a delineation and a sketch which they thought to be justice. But what of wisdom? does not the same man confess that it has no existence in philosophers? “Nor,” he says, <a name="fr_1125"></a><a href="#fn_1125"><font size="1">1126</font></a>
  “when <a name="iii.ii.vi.vi-p19.7"></a>Fabricius or <a name="iii.ii.vi.vi-p19.8"></a>Aristides is called just, is an example of justice sought from these as from a wise man; for none of these is wise in the sense in which we wish the truly wise to be understood. Nor were they who are esteemed and called wise, <a name="iii.ii.vi.vi-p19.9"></a>Marcus Cato and <a name="iii.ii.vi.vi-p19.10"></a>Caius Lælius, actually wise, nor those well-known seven; <a name="fr_1126"></a><a href="#fn_1126"><font size="1">1127</font></a>
  but from their constant practice of the middle duties, <a name="fr_1127"></a><a href="#fn_1127"><font size="1">1128</font></a>
  they bore a certain likeness and appearance <a name="fr_1128"></a><a href="#fn_1128"><font size="1">1129</font></a>
  of wise men.” If therefore wisdom is taken away from the philosophers by their own confession, and justice is taken away from those who are regarded as just, it follows that all those descriptions of virtue must be false, because no one can know what true virtue is but he who is just and wise. But no one is just and wise but he whom God has instructed with heavenly precepts.  </p>
