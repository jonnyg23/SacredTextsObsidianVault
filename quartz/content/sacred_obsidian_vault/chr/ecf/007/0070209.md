 <p> <a name="iii.ii.viii.xvii"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.viii.xvii-p0.1"></a>Chap. XXI.—Of the Sacred Rites of the Roman Gods.</h4>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.viii.xvii-p1"></a>But the senate also instituted other false gods of this kind,—Hope, Faith, Concord, Peace, Chastity, Piety; all of which, since they ought truly to be in the minds of men, they have falsely placed within walls. But although these have no substantial existence outside of man, nevertheless I should prefer that they should be worshipped, rather than Blight or Fever, which ought not to be consecrated, but rather to be execrated; than <a name="iii.ii.viii.xvii-p1.1"></a>Fornax, together with her sacred ovens; than <a name="iii.ii.viii.xvii-p1.2"></a>Stercutus, who first showed men to enrich the ground with manure; than the goddess <a name="iii.ii.viii.xvii-p1.3"></a>Muta, who brought forth the <a name="iii.ii.viii.xvii-p1.4"></a>Lares; than <a name="iii.ii.viii.xvii-p1.5"></a>Cumina, who presides over the cradles of infants; than <a name="iii.ii.viii.xvii-p1.6"></a>Caca, who gave information to <a name="iii.ii.viii.xvii-p1.7"></a>Hercules respecting the stealing of his cattle, that he might slay her brother. How many other monstrous and <a name="page_229"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 229</font></a> <a name="iii.ii.viii.xvii-Page_229"></a>ludicrous fictions there are, respecting which it is grievous to speak! I do not, however, wish to omit notice of <a name="iii.ii.viii.xvii-p1.8"></a>Terminus, since it is related that he did not give way even to <a name="iii.ii.viii.xvii-p1.9"></a>Jupiter, though he was an unwrought stone. They suppose that he has the custody of the boundaries, and public prayers are offered to him, that he may keep the stone of the Capitol immoveable, and preserve and extend the boundaries of the Roman empire.  </p>
