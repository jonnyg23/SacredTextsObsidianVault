 <p> <a name="iii.v.xlvi"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iii.v.xlvi-p0.1"></a>Chap. XLVI.</h4>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.v.xlvi-p1"></a>The armies thus approaching each other, seemed on the eve of a battle. Then <a name="iii.v.xlvi-p1.1"></a>Daia made this vow to <a name="iii.v.xlvi-p1.2"></a>Jupiter, that if he obtained victory he would extinguish and utterly efface the name of the Christians. And on the following night an angel of the Lord seemed to stand before <a name="iii.v.xlvi-p1.3"></a>Licinius while he was asleep, admonishing him to arise immediately, and with his whole army to put up a prayer to the Supreme God, and assuring him that by so doing he should obtain victory. <a name="iii.v.xlvi-p1.4"></a>Licinius fancied that, hearing this, he arose, and that his monitor, who was nigh him, directed how be should pray, and in what words. Awaking from sleep, he sent for one of his secretaries, and dictated these words exactly as he had heard them:—  </p>  
 <p class="Blockquote"><a name="iii.v.xlvi-p2"></a>“Supreme God, we beseech Thee; Holy God, we beseech Thee; unto Thee we commend all right; unto Thee we commend our safety; unto Thee we commend our empire. By Thee we live, by Thee we are victorious and happy. Supreme Holy God, hear our prayers; to Thee we stretch forth our arms. Hear, Holy Supreme God.”  </p>  
 <p class="Continue"><a name="iii.v.xlvi-p3"></a>Many copies were made of these words, and distributed amongst the principal commanders, who were to teach them to the soldiers under their charge. At this all men took fresh courage, in the confidence that victory bad been announced to them from heaven. <a name="iii.v.xlvi-p3.1"></a>Licinius resolved to give battle on the kalends of May; <a name="fr_1993"></a><a href="#fn_1993"><font size="1">1994</font></a>
  for precisely eight years before <a name="iii.v.xlvi-p4.1"></a>Daia had received the dignity of <span><a name="iii.v.xlvi-p4.2"></a>Cæsar</span>, and <a name="iii.v.xlvi-p4.3"></a>Licinius chose that day in hopes that <a name="iii.v.xlvi-p4.4"></a>Daia might be vanquished on the anniversary of <span><a name="iii.v.xlvi-p4.5"></a>his</span> reign, as <a name="iii.v.xlvi-p4.6"></a>Maxentius had been on <span><a name="iii.v.xlvi-p4.7"></a>his</span>. <a name="iii.v.xlvi-p4.8"></a>Daia, however, purposed to give battle earlier, to fight on the day before those kalends, <a name="fr_1994"></a><a href="#fn_1994"><font size="1">1995</font></a>
  and to triumph on the anniversary of his reign. Accounts came that <a name="iii.v.xlvi-p5.2"></a>Daia was in motion; the soldiers of <a name="iii.v.xlvi-p5.3"></a>Licinius armed themselves; and advanced. A barren and open plain, called <span><a name="iii.v.xlvi-p5.4"></a>Campus Serenus</span>, lay between the two armies. They were now in sight of one another. The soldiers of <a name="iii.v.xlvi-p5.5"></a>Licinius placed their shields on the ground, took off their helmets, and, following the example of their leaders, stretched forth their hands towards heaven. Then the emperor uttered the prayer, and they all repeated it after him. The host, doomed to speedy destruction, heard the murmur of the prayers of their adversaries. And now, the ceremony having been thrice performed, the soldiers of <a name="iii.v.xlvi-p5.6"></a>Licinius became full of courage, buckled on their helmets again, and resumed their shields. The two emperors advanced to a conference: but <a name="iii.v.xlvi-p5.7"></a>Daia could not be brought to peace; for he held <a name="iii.v.xlvi-p5.8"></a>Licinius in contempt, and imagined that the soldiers would presently abandon an emperor parsimonious in his donatives, and enter into the service of one liberal even to profusion. And indeed it was on this notion that he began the war. He looked for the voluntary surrender of the armies of <a name="iii.v.xlvi-p5.9"></a>Licinius; and, thus reinforced, he meant forthwith to have attacked <a name="iii.v.xlvi-p5.10"></a>Constantine.  </p>
