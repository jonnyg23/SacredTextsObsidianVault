 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.viii.v-p1"></a>But let us come to the philosophers, whose authority is regarded as more certain than that of the poets. <a name="iii.ii.viii.v-p1.1"></a>Plato asserts His monarchy, saying that there is but one God, by whom the world was prepared and completed with wonderful order. <a name="iii.ii.viii.v-p1.2"></a>Aristotle, his disciple, admits that there is one mind which presides over the world. <a name="iii.ii.viii.v-p1.3"></a>Antisthenes says that there is one who is God by nature, <a name="fr_1454"></a><a href="#fn_1454"><font size="1">1455</font></a>
  the governor of the whole system. It would be a long task to recount the statements which have been made respecting the Supreme God, either by <a name="iii.ii.viii.v-p2.2"></a>Thales, or by <a name="iii.ii.viii.v-p2.3"></a>Pythagoras and <a name="iii.ii.viii.v-p2.4"></a>Anaximenes before him, or afterwards by the Stoics <a name="iii.ii.viii.v-p2.5"></a>Cleanthes and <a name="iii.ii.viii.v-p2.6"></a>Chrysippus and <a name="iii.ii.viii.v-p2.7"></a>Zeno, or of our countrymen, by <a name="iii.ii.viii.v-p2.8"></a>Seneca following the Stoics, and by <a name="iii.ii.viii.v-p2.9"></a>Tullius himself, since all these attempted to define the being of God, <a name="fr_1455"></a><a href="#fn_1455"><font size="1">1456</font></a>
  and affirmed that the world is ruled by Him alone, and that He is not subject to any nature, since all nature derives its origin from Him.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.viii.v-p4"></a><a name="iii.ii.viii.v-p4.1"></a>Hermes, who, on account of his virtue and his knowledge of many arts, deserved the name of <a name="iii.ii.viii.v-p4.2"></a>Trismegistus, who preceded the philosophers in the antiquity of his doctrine, and who is reverenced by the Egyptians as a god, in asserting the majesty of the one God with infinite praises, calls Him Lord and Father, and says that He is without a name because He does not stand in need of a proper name, inasmuch as He is alone, and that He has no parents, since He exists of Himself and by Himself. In writing to his son he thus begins: To understand God is difficult, to describe Him in speech is impossible, even for one to whom it is possible to understand Him; for the perfect cannot be comprehended by the imperfect, nor the invisible by the visible.  </p>
