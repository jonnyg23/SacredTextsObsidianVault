 <p> <a name="iii.ii.i.xi"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.i.xi-p0.1"></a>Chap. X.—Of the life and actions of <a name="iii.ii.i.xi-p0.2"></a>Æsculapius, apollo, neptune, mars, castor and pollux, mercury and bacchus.</h4>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.i.xi-p1"></a>What other action worthy of divine honours, except the healing of <a name="iii.ii.i.xi-p1.1"></a>Hippolytus, did <a name="iii.ii.i.xi-p1.2"></a>Æsculapius perform, whose birth also was not without disgrace to <a name="iii.ii.i.xi-p1.3"></a>Apollo? His death was certainly more renowned, because he earned the distinction of being struck with lightning by a god. <a name="iii.ii.i.xi-p1.4"></a>Tarquitius, in a dissertation concerning illustrious men, says that he was born of uncertain parents, exposed, and found by some hunters; that he was nourished by a dog, and that, being delivered to <a name="iii.ii.i.xi-p1.5"></a>Chiron, he learned the art of medicine. He says, moreover, that he was a Messenian, but that he spent some time at <a name="iii.ii.i.xi-p1.6"></a>Epidaurus. <a name="iii.ii.i.xi-p1.7"></a>Tully also says that he was buried at Cynosuræ. What was the conduct of <a name="iii.ii.i.xi-p1.8"></a>Apollo, his father? Did he not, on account of his impassioned love, most disgracefully tend the flock of another, and build walls for <a name="iii.ii.i.xi-p1.9"></a>Laomedon, having been hired together with <a name="iii.ii.i.xi-p1.10"></a>Neptune for a reward, which could with impunity be withheld from him? And from him first the perfidious king learned to refuse <span><a name="iii.ii.i.xi-p1.11"></a>to carry out </span>whatever contract he had made with gods. And he also, while in love with a beautiful boy, offered violence to him, and while engaged in play, slew him.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.i.xi-p2"></a><a name="iii.ii.i.xi-p2.1"></a>Mars, when guilty of homicide, and set free from the charge of murder by the Athenians through favour, lest he should appear to be too fierce and savage, committed adultery with <a name="iii.ii.i.xi-p2.2"></a>Venus. <a name="iii.ii.i.xi-p2.3"></a>Castor and <a name="iii.ii.i.xi-p2.4"></a>Pollux, while they are engaged in carrying off the wives of others, ceased to be twin-brothers. For <a name="iii.ii.i.xi-p2.5"></a>Idas, being excited with jealousy on account of the injury, transfixed one<span><a name="iii.ii.i.xi-p2.6"></a> of the brothers </span>with his sword. And the poets relate that they live and die alternately: so that they are now the most wretched not only of the gods, but also of all mortals, inasmuch as they are not permitted to die once only. And yet <a name="iii.ii.i.xi-p2.7"></a>Homer, differing from the other poets, simply records that they both died. For when he represented <a name="iii.ii.i.xi-p2.8"></a>Helen as sitting by the side of <a name="iii.ii.i.xi-p2.9"></a>Priam on the walls of Troy, and recognising all the chieftains of Greece, but as looking in vain for her brothers only, he added to his speech a verse of this kind:—  </p>  <blockquote><a name="iii.ii.i.xi-p2.10"></a>   “Thus she; unconscious that in Sparta they,<br>    Their native land, beneath the sod were laid.”<br>  </blockquote>  
 <p class="Continue"><a name="iii.ii.i.xi-p3"></a>What did <a name="iii.ii.i.xi-p3.1"></a>Mercury, a thief and spendthrift, leave to contribute to his fame, except the memory of his frauds? Doubtless he was deserving of heaven, because he taught the exercises of the palæstra, and was the first who invented the lyre. <a name="fr_46"></a><a href="#fn_46"><font size="1">47</font></a>
  It is necessary that <a name="iii.ii.i.xi-p4.3"></a>Father Liber should be of chief authority, and of the first rank in the senate of the gods, because he was the only one of them all, except <a name="iii.ii.i.xi-p4.4"></a>Jupiter, who triumphed, led an army, and subdued the Indians. But that very great and unconquered Indian commander was most shamefully overpowered by love and lust. For, being conveyed to Crete with his effeminate retinue, he met with an unchaste woman on the shore; and in the confidence inspired by his <a name="page_20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 20</font></a> <a name="iii.ii.i.xi-Page_20"></a>Indian victory, he wished to give proof of his manliness, lest he should appear too effeminate. And so he took to himself in marriage that woman, the betrayer of her father, and the murderer of her brother, after that she had been deserted and repudiated by another husband; and he made her <a name="iii.ii.i.xi-p4.5"></a>Libera, and with her ascended into heaven.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.i.xi-p5"></a>What was the conduct of <a name="iii.ii.i.xi-p5.1"></a>Jupiter, the father of all these, who in the customary prayer is styled <a name="fr_47"></a><a href="#fn_47"><font size="1">48</font></a>
  Most Excellent and Great? Is he not, from his earliest childhood, proved to be impious, and almost a parricide, since he expelled his father from his kingdom, and banished him, and did not await his death though he was aged and worn out, such was his eagerness for rule? And when he had taken his fathers throne by violence and arms, he was attacked with war by the Titans, which was the beginning of evils to the human race; and when these had been overcome and lasting peace procured, he spent the rest of his life in debaucheries and adulteries. I forbear to mention the virgins whom he dishonoured. For that is wont to be judged endurable. I cannot pass by the cases of <a name="iii.ii.i.xi-p6.4"></a>Amphitryon and <a name="iii.ii.i.xi-p6.5"></a>Tyndarus, whose houses he filled to overflowing with disgrace and infamy. But he reached the height of impiety and guilt in carrying off the royal boy. For it did not appear enough to cover himself with infamy in offering violence to women, unless he also outraged his own sex. This is true adultery, which is done against nature. Whether he who committed these crimes can be called Greatest is a matter of question, undoubtedly he is not the Best; to which name corrupters, adulterers, and incestuous persons have no claim; unless it happens that we men are mistaken in terming those who do such things wicked and abandoned, and in judging them most deserving of every kind of punishment. But <a name="iii.ii.i.xi-p6.6"></a>Marcus Tullius was foolish in upbraiding <a name="iii.ii.i.xi-p6.7"></a>Caius Verres with adulteries, for <a name="iii.ii.i.xi-p6.8"></a>Jupiter, whom he worshipped, committed the same; and in upbraiding <a name="iii.ii.i.xi-p6.9"></a>Publius Clodius with incest with his sister, for he who was Best and Greatest had the same person both as sister and wife.  </p>
