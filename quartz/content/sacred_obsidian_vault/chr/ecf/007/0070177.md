 <p> <a name="iii.ii.vii.xiii"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.vii.xiii-p0.1"></a>Chap. XIII.—Of the Soul, and the Testimonies Concerning Its Eternity.</h4>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vii.xiii-p1"></a>I have made it evident, as I think, that the soul is not subject to dissolution. It remains that I bring forward witnesses by whose authority my arguments may be confirmed. And I will not now allege the testimony of the prophets, whose system and divination consist in this alone, the teaching that man was created for the worship of God, and for receiving immortality from Him; but I will rather bring forward those whom they who reject the truth cannot but believe. <a name="iii.ii.vii.xiii-p1.1"></a>Hermes, describing the nature of man, that he might show how he was made by God, introduced this statement: “And the same out of two natures—the immortal and the mortal—made one nature, that of man, making the same partly immortal, and partly mortal; and bringing this, he placed it in the midst, between that nature which was divine and immortal, and that which was mortal and changeable, that seeing all things, he may admire all things.” But some one may perhaps reckon him in the number of the philosophers, although he has been placed among the gods, and honoured by the Egyptians under the name of <a name="iii.ii.vii.xiii-p1.2"></a>Mercury, and may give no more authority to him than to <a name="iii.ii.vii.xiii-p1.3"></a>Plato or <a name="iii.ii.vii.xiii-p1.4"></a>Pythagoras. Let us therefore seek for greater testimony. A certain <a name="iii.ii.vii.xiii-p1.5"></a>Polites asked <a name="iii.ii.vii.xiii-p1.6"></a>Apollo of Miletus whether the soul remains after death or goes to dissolution; and he replied in these verses:—  </p>  <blockquote><a name="iii.ii.vii.xiii-p1.7"></a>   “As long as the soul is bound by fetters to the body, perceiving corruptible sufferings, it yields to mortal pains; but when, after the wasting of the body, it has found a very swift dissolution of mortality, it is altogether borne into the air, never growing old, and it remains always uninjured; for the first-born providence of God made this disposition.”<br>  </blockquote>  
 <p class="Continue"><a name="iii.ii.vii.xiii-p2"></a>What do the Sibylline poems say? Do they not declare that this is so, when they say that the time will come when God will judge the living and the dead?—whose authority we will hereafter bring forward. <a name="fr_1380"></a><a href="#fn_1380"><font size="1">1381</font></a>
  Therefore the opinion entertained by <a name="iii.ii.vii.xiii-p6.4"></a>Democritus, and <a name="iii.ii.vii.xiii-p6.5"></a>Epicurus, and <a name="iii.ii.vii.xiii-p6.6"></a>Dicæarchus concerning the dissolution of the soul is false; and they would not venture to speak concerning the destruction of souls, in the presence of any magician, who knew that souls are called forth from the lower regions by certain incantations, and that they are at hand, and afford themselves to be seen by human eyes, and speak, and foretell future events; and if they should thus venture, they would be overpowered by the fact itself, and by proofs presented to them. But because they did not comprehend the nature of the soul, which is so subtle that it escapes the eyes of the human mind, they said that it perishes. What of <a name="iii.ii.vii.xiii-p6.7"></a>Aristoxenus, who denied that there is any soul at all, even while it lives in the body? But as on the lyre harmonious sound, and the strain which musicians call harmony, is produced by the tightening of the strings, so he thought that the power of perception existed in bodies from the joining together of the vitals, and from the vigour of the limbs; than which nothing can be said more senseless. Truly he had his eyes uninjured, but his heart was blind, with which he did not see that he lived, and had the mind by which he had conceived that very thought. But this has happened to many philosophers, <a name="page_211"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 211</font></a> <a name="iii.ii.vii.xiii-Page_211"></a>that they did not believe in the existence of any object which is not apparent to the eyes; whereas the sight of the mind ought to be much clearer than that of the body, for perceiving those things the force and nature of which are rather felt than seen.  </p>
