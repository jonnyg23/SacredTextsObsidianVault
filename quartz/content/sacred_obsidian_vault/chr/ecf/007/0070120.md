 <p> <a name="iii.ii.v.vii"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.v.vii-p0.1"></a>Chap. VII.—Of the Coming of Jesus, and Its Fruit; And of the Virtues and Vices of that Age.</h4>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.v.vii-p1"></a>But God, as a most indulgent parent, when the last time approached, sent a messenger to bring back that old age, and justice which had been put to flight, that the human race might not be agitated by very great and perpetual errors. Therefore the appearance of that golden time returned, and justice was restored to the earth, but was assigned to a few; and this justice is nothing else than the pious and religious worship of the one God. But perhaps some may be inclined to ask, why, if this be justice, it is not given to all mankind, and the whole multitude does not agree to it. This is a matter of great disputation, why a difference was retained by God when He gave justice to the earth; and this I have shown in another place, and whenever a favourable opportunity shall occur it shall be explained. Now it is sufficient very briefly to signify it: that virtue can neither be discerned, unless it has vices opposed to it; nor be perfect, unless it is exercised by adversity. <a name="fr_974"></a><a href="#fn_974"><font size="1">975</font></a>
  For God designed that there should be this distinction between good and evil things, that we may know from that which is evil the quality of the good, and also the quality of the evil from the good; nor can the nature of the one be understood if the other is taken away. God therefore did not exclude evil, that the nature of virtue might be evident. For how could patient endurance <a name="fr_975"></a><a href="#fn_975"><font size="1">976</font></a>
  retain its meaning and name if there were nothing which we were compelled to endure? <a name="fr_976"></a><a href="#fn_976"><font size="1">977</font></a>
  How could faith devoted to its God deserve praise, unless there were some one who wished to turn us away from God? For on this account He permitted the unjust to be more powerful, that they might be able to compel to evil; and on this account to be more numerous, that virtue might be precious, because it is rare. And this very point is admirably and briefly shown by <a name="iii.ii.v.vii-p4.2"></a>Quintilian in “the muffled head.” <a name="fr_977"></a><a href="#fn_977"><font size="1">978</font></a>
  “For what virtue,” he says, “would there be in innocence, had not its rarity furnished it with praises? But because it is provided by nature that hatred, desire, and anger drive men blindly to that object to which they have applied themselves, to be free from fault appears to be beyond the power of man. Otherwise, if nature had given to all men equal affections, piety would be nothing.”  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.v.vii-p6"></a>How true this is, the necessity of the case itself teaches. For if it is virtue to resist with fortitude evils and vices, it is evident that, without evil and vice, there is no <span><a name="iii.ii.v.vii-p6.1"></a>perfected</span> virtue; and that God might render this complete and perfect, He retained that which was contrary to it, with which it might contend. For, being agitated by evils which harass it, it gains stability; and in proportion to the frequency with which <a name="page_143"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 143</font></a> <a name="iii.ii.v.vii-Page_143"></a>it is urged onward, is the firmness with which it is strengthened. This is evidently the cause which effects that, although justice is sent to men, yet it cannot be said that a golden age exists; because God has not taken away evil, that He might retain that diversity which alone preserves the mystery of a divine religion.  </p>
