 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1"></a>Maximin <a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1.1"></a>Daia was incensed at the nomination of <a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1.2"></a>Licinius to the dignity of <span><a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1.3"></a>emperor</span>, and he would no longer be called <span><a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1.4"></a>Cæsar</span>, or allow himself to be ranked as third in authority. <a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1.5"></a>Galerius, by repeated messages, besought <a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1.6"></a>Daia to yield, and to acquiesce in <span><a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1.7"></a>his</span> arrangement, to give place to age, and to reverence the grey hairs of <a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1.8"></a>Licinius. But <a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1.9"></a>Daia became more and more insolent. He urged that, as it was he who first assumed the purple, so, by possession, he had right to priority in rank; and he set at nought the entreaties and the injunctions of <a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1.10"></a>Galerius. That brute animal was stung to the quick, and bellowed when the mean creature whom he had made <span><a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1.11"></a>Cæsar</span>, in expectation of his thorough obsequiousness, forgot the great favour conferred on him, and impiously withstood the requests and will of his benefactor. <a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1.12"></a>Galerius at length, overcome by the obstinacy of <a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1.13"></a>Daia, abolished the subordinate title of <span><a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1.14"></a>Cæsar</span>, gave to himself and <a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1.15"></a>Licinius that of <span><a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1.16"></a>the Augusti</span>, and to <a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1.17"></a>Daia and <a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1.18"></a>Constantine that of <span><a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1.19"></a>sons of the Augusti</span>. <a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1.20"></a>Daia, some time after, in a letter to <a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1.21"></a>Galerius, took occasion to observe, that at the last general muster he had been saluted by his army under the title of <span><a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1.22"></a>Augustus</span>. <a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1.23"></a>Galerius, vexed and grieved at this, commanded that all the four should have the appellation of <span><a name="iii.v.xxxii-p1.24"></a>emperor</span>. <a name="fr_1984"></a><a href="#fn_1984"><font size="1">1985</font></a>
