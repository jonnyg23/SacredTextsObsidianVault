 <p> <a name="iii.ii.vii.vii"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.vii.vii-p0.1"></a>Chap. VII.—Of the Variety of Philosophers, and Their Truth.</h4>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vii.vii-p1"></a>And because the philosophers did not comprehend this main point, they were neither able to comprehend truth, although they for the most part both saw and explained those things of which the main point itself consists. But different persons brought forward all these things, and in different ways, not connecting the causes of things, nor the consequences, nor the reasons, so that they might join together and complete that main point which comprises the whole. But it is easy to show that almost the whole truth has been divided by philosophers and sects. For we do not overthrow philosophy, as the Academics are accustomed to do, whose plan was to reply to everything, which is rather to calumniate and mock; but we show that no sect was so much out of the way, and no philosopher so vain, as not to see something of the truth. <a name="fr_1338"></a><a href="#fn_1338"><font size="1">1339</font></a>
  But while they are mad with the desire of contradicting, while they defend their own arguments even though false, and overthrow those of others even though true, not only has the truth escaped from them, which they pretended that they were seeking, but they themselves lost it chiefly through their own fault. But if there had been any one to collect together the truth which was dispersed amongst individuals and scattered amongst sects, and to reduce it to a body, he assuredly would not disagree with us. But no one is able to do this, unless he has experience <a name="fr_1339"></a><a href="#fn_1339"><font size="1">1340</font></a>
  and knowledge of the truth. But to know the truth belongs to him only who has been taught by God. For he cannot in any other way reject the things which are false, or choose and approve of those which are true; but if even by chance he should effect this, he would most surely act the part of the philosopher; and though he could not defend those things by divine testimonies, yet the truth would explain itself by its own light. Wherefore the error of those is incredible, who, when they have approved of any sect, and have devoted themselves to it, condemn all others as false and vain, and arm themselves for battle, neither knowing what they ought to defend nor what to refute; and make attacks everywhere, without distinction, <a name="fr_1340"></a><a href="#fn_1340"><font size="1">1341</font></a>
  upon all things which are brought forward by those who disagree with them.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vii.vii-p5"></a>On account of these most obstinate contentions of theirs, no philosophy existed which made a nearer approach to the truth, for the whole truth has been comprised by these in separate portions. <a name="fr_1341"></a><a href="#fn_1341"><font size="1">1342</font></a>
  <a name="iii.ii.vii.vii-p6.2"></a>Plato said <a name="fr_1342"></a><a href="#fn_1342"><font size="1">1343</font></a>
  that the world was made by God: the prophets <a name="fr_1343"></a><a href="#fn_1343"><font size="1">1344</font></a>
  speak the same; and the same is apparent from the verses of the <a name="iii.ii.vii.vii-p8.3"></a>Sibyl. They therefore are in error, who have said either that all things were produced of their own accord or from an assemblage of atoms; <a name="fr_1344"></a><a href="#fn_1344"><font size="1">1345</font></a>
  since so great a world, so adorned and of such magnitude, could neither have been made nor arranged and set in order without some most skilful author, and that very arrangement by which all things are perceived to be kept together and to be governed bespeaks <a name="fr_1345"></a><a href="#fn_1345"><font size="1">1346</font></a>
  an artificer with a most skilful mind. The Stoics say that the world, and all things which are in it, were made for the sake of men: the sacred writings <a name="fr_1346"></a><a href="#fn_1346"><font size="1">1347</font></a>
  teach us the same thing. Therefore <a name="iii.ii.vii.vii-p11.4"></a>Democritus was in error, who thought that they were poured forth from the earth like worms, without any author or plan. For the reason of mans creation belongs to a divine mystery; and because he was unable to know this, he drew <a name="fr_1347"></a><a href="#fn_1347"><font size="1">1348</font></a>
  down mans life to nothing. <a name="iii.ii.vii.vii-p12.2"></a>Aristo asserted that men were born to the exercise of virtue; we are also reminded of and learn the same from the prophets. Therefore <a name="iii.ii.vii.vii-p12.3"></a>Aristippus is deceived, who made man subject to pleasure, that is, to evil, as though he were a beast. <a name="iii.ii.vii.vii-p12.4"></a>Pherecydes and <a name="iii.ii.vii.vii-p12.5"></a>Plato contended that souls were immortal; but this is a peculiar doctrine in our religion. Therefore <a name="iii.ii.vii.vii-p12.6"></a>Dicæarchus was mistaken, together with <a name="iii.ii.vii.vii-p12.7"></a>Democritus, who argued that souls perished with the body and were dissolved, <a name="iii.ii.vii.vii-p12.8"></a>Zeno the Stoic taught that there were infernal regions, and that the abodes of the good were separated from the wicked; and that the former enjoyed peaceful and delightful regions, but that the latter suffered punishment in dark places, and in dreadful abysses of mire: the prophets show the same thing. Therefore <a name="iii.ii.vii.vii-p12.9"></a>Epicurus was mistaken, who thought that that was an invention <a name="fr_1348"></a><a href="#fn_1348"><font size="1">1349</font></a>
  of the poets, and explained those punishments of the infernal regions, which are spoken of, as happening in this life. Therefore the philosophers touched upon the whole truth, and every secret of our holy religion; but when others denied it, they were unable to defend that which they had found, because the system did not agree <a name="fr_1349"></a><a href="#fn_1349"><font size="1">1350</font></a>
  with the particulars; nor were they able to reduce to a summary those things which they had perceived to be true, as we have done above.  </p>
