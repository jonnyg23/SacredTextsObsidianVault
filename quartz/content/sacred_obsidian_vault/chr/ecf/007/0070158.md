 <p> <a name="iii.ii.vi.xx"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.vi.xx-p0.1"></a>Chap. XX.—Of the Senses, and Their Pleasures in the Brutes and in Man; And of Pleasures of the Eyes, and Spectacles.</h4>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vi.xx-p1"></a>It remains that I should speak against the pleasures of the five senses, and this briefly, for the measure of the book itself now demands moderation; all of which, since they are vicious and deadly, ought to be overcome and subdued by virtue, or, as I said a little before respecting the affections, be recalled to their proper office. The other animals have no pleasure, except the one only which relates to generation. Therefore they use their senses for the necessity of their nature: they see, in order that they may seek those things which are necessary for the preservation of life; they hear one another, and distinguish one another, that they may be able to assemble together; they either discover from the smell, or perceive from the taste, the things which are useful for food; they refuse and reject the things which are useless, they measure the business of eating and drinking by the fulness of their stomach. But the foresight of the most skilful Creator gave to man pleasure without limit, and liable to fall into vice, because He set before him virtue, which might always be at variance with pleasure, as with a domestic enemy. <a name="iii.ii.vi.xx-p1.1"></a>Cicero says, in the <a name="iii.ii.vi.xx-p1.2"></a>Cato Major: <a name="fr_1229"></a><a href="#fn_1229"><font size="1">1230</font></a>
  “In truth, debaucheries, and adulteries, and disgraceful actions are excited by no other enticements than those of pleasure. And since nature or some God has given to man nothing more excellent than the mind, nothing is so hostile to this divine benefit and gift as pleasure. For when lust bears sway there is no place for temperance, nor can virtue have any existence when pleasure reigns supreme.” But, on the other hand, God gave virtue on this account, that it might subdue and conquer pleasure, and that, when it passed the boundaries assigned to it, it might restrain it within the prescribed limits, lest it should soothe and captivate man with enjoyments, render him subject to its control, and punish him with everlasting death.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vi.xx-p3"></a>The pleasure arising from the eyes is various and manifold, which is derived from the sight of objects which are pleasant in intercourse with men, or in nature or workmanship. The philosophers rightly took this away. For they say that it is much more excellent and worthy of man to look upon the heaven <a name="fr_1230"></a><a href="#fn_1230"><font size="1">1231</font></a>
  rather than carved works, and to admire this most beautiful work adorned with the lights of the stars shining through, <a name="fr_1231"></a><a href="#fn_1231"><font size="1">1232</font></a>
  as with flowers, than to admire things painted and moulded, and varied with jewels. But when they have eloquently exhorted us to despise earthly things, and have urged us to look up to the heaven, nevertheless they do not despise these public spectacles. Therefore they are both delighted with these, and are gladly present at them; though, since they are the greatest incitement to vices, and have a most powerful tendency to corrupt our minds, they ought to be taken away from us; for they not only contribute in no respect to a happy life, but even inflict the greatest injury. For he who reckons it a pleasure, that a man, though justly condemned, should be slain in his sight, pollutes his conscience as much as if he should become a spectator and a sharer of a homicide which is secretly committed. <a name="fr_1232"></a><a href="#fn_1232"><font size="1">1233</font></a>
  And yet they call these sports in which human blood is shed. So far has the feeling of humanity departed from the men, that when they destroy the lives of men, they think that they are amusing themselves with sport, being more guilty than all those whose blood-shedding they esteem a pleasure. I ask now whether they can be just and pious men, who, when they see men placed under the stroke of death, and entreating mercy, not only suffer them to be put to death, but also demand it, and give cruel and inhuman votes for their death, not being satiated with wounds nor contented with bloodshed. Moreover, they order them, even though wounded and prostrate, to be attacked again, and their caresses to he wasted <a name="fr_1233"></a><a href="#fn_1233"><font size="1">1234</font></a>
  with blows, that no one may delude them by a pretended death. They are even angry with the combatants, unless one of the two is quickly slain; and as though they thirsted for human blood, they hate delays. They demand that other and fresh combatants should be given to them, that they may satisfy their eyes <a name="page_187"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 187</font></a> <a name="iii.ii.vi.xx-Page_187"></a>as soon as possible. Being imbued with this practice, they have lost their humanity. Therefore they do not spare even the innocent, but practice upon all that which they have learned in the slaughter of the wicked. It is not therefore befitting that those who strive to keep to the path of justice should be companions and sharers in this public homicide. For when God forbids us to kill, He not only prohibits us from open violence, <a name="fr_1234"></a><a href="#fn_1234"><font size="1">1235</font></a>
  which is not even allowed by the public laws, but He warns us against the commission of those things which are esteemed lawful among men. Thus it will be neither lawful for a just man to engage in warfare, since his warfare is justice itself, nor to accuse any one of a capital charge, because it makes no difference whether you put a man to death by word, or rather by the sword, since it is the act of putting to death itself <a name="fr_1235"></a><a href="#fn_1235"><font size="1">1236</font></a>
  which is prohibited. Therefore, with regard to this precept of God, there ought to be no exception at all; but that it is always unlawful to put to death a man, whom God willed to be a sacred animal. <a name="fr_1236"></a><a href="#fn_1236"><font size="1">1237</font></a>
    </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vi.xx-p11"></a>Therefore let no one imagine that even this is allowed, to strangle <a name="fr_1237"></a><a href="#fn_1237"><font size="1">1238</font></a>
  newly-born children, which is the greatest impiety; for God breathes into their souls for life, and not for death. But men, that there may be no crime with which they may not pollute their hands, deprive souls as yet innocent and simple of the light which they themselves have not given. Can any one, indeed, expect that they would abstain from the blood of others who do not abstain even from their own? But these are without any controversy wicked and unjust. What are they whom a false piety <a name="fr_1238"></a><a href="#fn_1238"><font size="1">1239</font></a>
  compels to expose their children? Can they be considered innocent who expose their own offspring <a name="fr_1239"></a><a href="#fn_1239"><font size="1">1240</font></a>
  as a prey to dogs, and as far as it depends upon themselves, kill them in a more cruel manner than if they had strangled them? Who can doubt that he is impious who gives occasion <a name="fr_1240"></a><a href="#fn_1240"><font size="1">1241</font></a>
  for the pity of others? For, although that which he has wished should befall the child—namely, that it should be brought up—he has certainly consigned his own offspring either to servitude or to the brothel? But who does not understand, who is ignorant what things may happen, or are accustomed to happen, in the case of each sex, even through error? For this is shown by the example of Œdipus alone, confused with twofold guilt. It is therefore as wicked to expose as it is to kill. But truly parricides complain of the scantiness of their means, and allege that they have not enough for bringing up more children; as though, in truth, their means were in the power of those who possess them, or God did not daily make the rich poor, and the poor rich. Wherefore, if any one on account of poverty shall be unable to bring up children, it is better to abstain from marriage <a name="fr_1241"></a><a href="#fn_1241"><font size="1">1242</font></a>
  than with wicked hands to mar the work of God.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vi.xx-p17"></a>If, then, it is in no way permitted to commit homicide, it is not allowed us to be present at all, <a name="fr_1242"></a><a href="#fn_1242"><font size="1">1243</font></a>
  lest any bloodshed should overspread the conscience, since that blood is offered for the gratification of the people. And I am inclined to think that the corrupting influence of the stage is still more contaminating. <a name="fr_1243"></a><a href="#fn_1243"><font size="1">1244</font></a>
  For the subject of comedies are the dishonouring of virgins, or the loves of harlots; and the more eloquent they are who have composed the accounts of these disgraceful actions, the more do they persuade by the elegance of their sentiments; and harmonious and polished verses more readily remain fixed in the memory of the hearers. In like manner, the stories of the tragedians place before the eyes the parricides and incests of wicked kings, and represent tragic <a name="fr_1244"></a><a href="#fn_1244"><font size="1">1245</font></a>
  crimes. And what other effect do the immodest gestures of the players produce, but both teach and excite lusts? whose enervated bodies, rendered effeminate after the gait and dress of women, imitate <a name="fr_1245"></a><a href="#fn_1245"><font size="1">1246</font></a>
  unchaste women by their disgraceful gestures. Why should I speak of the actors of <span><a name="iii.ii.vi.xx-p21.2"></a>mimes</span>, <a name="fr_1246"></a><a href="#fn_1246"><font size="1">1247</font></a>
  who hold forth instruction in corrupting influences, who teach adulteries while they feign them, and by pretended actions train to those which are true? What can young men or virgins do, when they see that these things are practised without shame, and willingly beheld by all? They are plainly admonished of what they can do, and are inflamed with lust, which is especially excited by seeing; and every one according to his sex forms <a name="fr_1247"></a><a href="#fn_1247"><font size="1">1248</font></a>
  himself in these representations. And they approve of these things, while they laugh at them, and with vices clinging to them, they return more corrupted to their apartments; and not boys only, who ought not to be inured to vices prematurely, but also old men, whom it does not become at their age to sin. <a name="page_188"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 188</font></a> <a name="iii.ii.vi.xx-Page_188"></a>  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vi.xx-p24"></a>What else does the practice of the Circensian games contain but levity, vanity, and madness? For their souls are hurried away to mad excitement with as great impetuosity as that with which the chariot races are there carried on; so that they who come for the sake of beholding the spectacle now themselves exhibit more of a spectacle, when they begin to utter exclamations, to be thrown into transports, and to leap from their seats. Therefore all spectacles ought to be avoided, not only that no vice may settle in our breasts, which ought to be tranquil and peaceful; but that the habitual indulgence of any pleasure may not soothe and captivate us, and turn us aside from God and from good works. <a name="fr_1248"></a><a href="#fn_1248"><font size="1">1249</font></a>
  For the celebrations of the games are festivals in honour of the gods, inasmuch as they were instituted on account of their birthdays, or the dedication of new temples. And at first the huntings, which are called shows, were in honour of <a name="iii.ii.vi.xx-p25.3"></a>Saturnus, and the scenic games in honour of <a name="iii.ii.vi.xx-p25.4"></a>Liber, but the Circensian in honour of <a name="iii.ii.vi.xx-p25.5"></a>Neptune. By degrees, however, the same honour began to be paid also to the other gods, and separate games were dedicated to their names, as <a name="iii.ii.vi.xx-p25.6"></a>Sisinnius Capito teaches in his book on the games. Therefore, if any one is present at the spectacles to which men assemble for the sake of religion, he has departed from the worship of God, and has betaken himself to those deities whose birthdays and festivals he has celebrated. <a name="fr_1249"></a><a href="#fn_1249"><font size="1">1250</font></a>
