 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.v.xli-p1"></a>But the empress, an exile in some desert region of Syria, secretly informed her father <a name="iii.v.xli-p1.1"></a>Diocletian of the calamity that had befallen her. He despatched messengers to <a name="iii.v.xli-p1.2"></a>Daia, requesting that his daughter might be sent to him. He could not prevail. Again and again he entreated; yet she was not sent. At length he employed a relation of his, a military man high in power and authority, to implore <a name="iii.v.xli-p1.3"></a>Daia by the remembrance of past favours. This messenger, equally unsuccessful in his negotiation as the others, reported to <a name="iii.v.xli-p1.4"></a>Diocletian that his prayers were vain.  </p>
