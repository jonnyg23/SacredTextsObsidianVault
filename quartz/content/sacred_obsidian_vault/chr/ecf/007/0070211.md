 <p> <a name="iii.ii.viii.xix"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.viii.xix-p0.1"></a>Chap. XXIII.—Of the Gods and Sacred Rites of the Barbarians.</h4>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.viii.xix-p1"></a>We have spoken respecting the gods: now we will speak of the rites and practices of their sacred institutions. A human victim used to be immolated to the <a name="iii.ii.viii.xix-p1.1"></a>Cyprian Jupiter, as <a name="iii.ii.viii.xix-p1.2"></a>Teucer had appointed. Thus also the Tauri used to offer strangers to <a name="iii.ii.viii.xix-p1.3"></a>Diana; the <a name="iii.ii.viii.xix-p1.4"></a>Latian Jupiter also was propitiated with human blood. Also before <a name="iii.ii.viii.xix-p1.5"></a>Saturnus, men of sixty years of age, according to the oracle <a name="fr_1472"></a><a href="#fn_1472"><font size="1">1473</font></a>
  of <a name="iii.ii.viii.xix-p2.3"></a>Apollo, were thrown from a bridge into the Tiber. And the Carthaginians not only offered infants to the same <a name="iii.ii.viii.xix-p2.4"></a>Saturnus; but being conquered by the Sicilians, to make an expiation, they immolated two hundred sons of nobles. And not more mild than these are those offerings which are even now made to the Great Mother and to <a name="iii.ii.viii.xix-p2.5"></a>Bellona, in which the priests make an offering, not with the blood of others, but with their own blood; when, mutilating themselves, they cease to be men, and yet do not pass over to the women; or, cutting their shoulders, they sprinkle the loathsome altars with their own blood. But these things are cruel.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.viii.xix-p3"></a>Let us come to those which are mild. The sacred rites of <a name="iii.ii.viii.xix-p3.1"></a>Isis show nothing else than the manner in which she lost and found her little son, who is called <a name="iii.ii.viii.xix-p3.2"></a>Osiris. For first her priests and attendants, having shaved all their limbs, and beating their breasts, howl, lament, and search, imitating the manner in which his mother was affected; afterwards the boy is found by <a name="iii.ii.viii.xix-p3.3"></a>Cynocephalus. Thus the mournful rites are ended with gladness. The mystery of <a name="iii.ii.viii.xix-p3.4"></a>Ceres also resembles these, in which torches are lighted, and <a name="iii.ii.viii.xix-p3.5"></a>Proserpine is sought for through the night; and when she has been found, the whole rite is finished with congratulations and the throwing about of torches. The people of <a name="iii.ii.viii.xix-p3.6"></a>Lampsacus, offer an ass to <a name="iii.ii.viii.xix-p3.7"></a>Priapus as an appropriate victim. <a name="fr_1473"></a><a href="#fn_1473"><font size="1">1474</font></a>
  Lindus is a town of Rhodes, where sacred rites in honour of <a name="iii.ii.viii.xix-p4.2"></a>Hercules are celebrated with revilings. For when <a name="iii.ii.viii.xix-p4.3"></a>Hercules had taken away his oxen from a ploughman, and had slain them, he avenged his injury by taunts; and afterwards having been himself appointed priest, it was ordained that he himself, and other priests after him, should celebrate sacrifices with the same revilings. But the mystery of the Cretan <a name="iii.ii.viii.xix-p4.4"></a>Jupiter represents the manner in which he was withdrawn from his father, or brought up. The goat is beside him, by the teats of which <a name="iii.ii.viii.xix-p4.5"></a>Amalthea nourished the boy. The sacred rites of the mother of the gods also show the same thing. For because the Corybantes then drowned the cry of the boy by the tinkling of their helmets and the striking of their shields, a representation of this circumstance is now repeated in the sacred rites; but cymbals are beaten instead of helmets, and drums instead of shields, that <a name="iii.ii.viii.xix-p4.6"></a>Saturnus may not hear the cries of the boy.  </p>
