 <p> <a name="iii.ii.vii.xxvi"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.vii.xxvi-p0.1"></a>Chap. XXVI.—Of the Loosing of the Devil, and of the Second and Greatest Judgment.</h4>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vii.xxvi-p1"></a>We have said, a little before, that it will come to pass at the commencement of the sacred reign, that the prince of the devils will be bound by God. But he also, when the thousand years of the kingdom, that is, seven thousand <span><a name="iii.ii.vii.xxvi-p1.1"></a>of the world</span>, shall begin to be ended, will be loosed afresh, and being sent forth from prison, will go forth and assemble all the nations, which shall then be under the dominion of the righteous, that they may make war against the holy city; and there shall be collected together from all the world an innumerable company of the nations, and shall besiege and surround the city. Then the last anger of God shall come upon the nations, and shall utterly <a name="fr_1429"></a><a href="#fn_1429"><font size="1">1430</font></a>
  destroy them; and first He shall shake the earth most violently, and by its motion the mountains of Syria shall be rent, and the hills shall sink down precipitously, and the walls of all cities shall fall, and God shall cause the sun to stand, so that he set not for three days, and shall set it on fire; and excessive heat and great burning shall descend upon the hostile and impious people, and showers of brimstone, <a name="page_221"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 221</font></a> <a name="iii.ii.vii.xxvi-Page_221"></a>and hailstones, and drops of fire; and their spirits shall melt through the heat, and their bodies shall be bruised by the hail, and they shall smite one another with the sword. The mountains shall be filled with carcases, and the plains shall be covered with bones; but the people of God during those three days shall be concealed under caves of the earth, until the anger of God against the nations and the last judgment shall be ended.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vii.xxvi-p3"></a>Then the righteous shall go forth from their hiding-places, and shall find all things covered with carcases and bones. But the whole race of the wicked shall utterly perish; and there shall no longer be any nation in this world, but the nation of God alone. Then for seven continuous years the woods shall be untouched, nor shall timber be cut from the mountains, but the arms of the nations shall be burnt; and now there shall be no war, but peace and everlasting rest. But when the thousand years shall be completed, the world shall be renewed by God, and the heavens shall be folded together, and the earth shall be changed, and God shall transform men into the similitude of angels, and they shall be white as snow; and they shall always be employed in the sight of the Almighty, and shall make offerings to their Lord, and serve Him for ever. At the same time shall take place that second and public resurrection <a name="fr_1430"></a><a href="#fn_1430"><font size="1">1431</font></a>
  of all, in which the unrighteous shall be raised to everlasting punishments. These are they who have worshipped the works of their own hands, who have either been ignorant of, or have denied the Lord and Parent of the world. But their lord with his servants shall be seized and condemned to punishment, together with whom all the band of the wicked, in accordance with their deeds, shall be burnt for ever with perpetual fire in the sight of angels and the righteous.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vii.xxvi-p5"></a>This is the doctrine of the holy prophets which we Christians follow; this is our wisdom, which they who worship frail objects, or maintain an empty philosophy, deride as folly and vanity, because we are not accustomed to defend and assert it in public, since God orders us in quietness and silence to hide His secret, and to keep it within our own conscience; and not to strive with obstinate contention against those who are ignorant of the truth, and who rigorously assail God and His religion not for the sake of learning, but of censuring and jeering. For a mystery ought to be most faithfully concealed and covered, especially by us, who bear the name of faith. <a name="fr_1431"></a><a href="#fn_1431"><font size="1">1432</font></a>
  But they accuse this silence of ours, as though it were the result of an evil conscience; whence also they invent some detestable things respecting those who are holy and blameless, and willingly believe their own inventions.  </p>  <blockquote><a name="iii.ii.vii.xxvi-p6.3"></a>   The address to <a name="iii.ii.vii.xxvi-p6.5"></a>Constantine is wanting in some <span><a name="iii.ii.vii.xxvi-p6.6"></a>mss.</span> and editions, but is inserted in the text by Migne, as found in some important <span><a name="iii.ii.vii.xxvi-p6.7"></a>mss.</span>, and as in accordance with the style and spirit of <a name="iii.ii.vii.xxvi-p6.8"></a>Lactantius.<br>  </blockquote>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vii.xxvi-p7"></a>But all fictions have now been hushed, most holy Emperor, since the time when the great God raised thee up for the restoration of the house of justice, and for the protection of the human race; for while thou rulest the Roman state, we worshippers of God are no more regarded as accursed and impious. Since the truth now comes forth <a name="fr_1432"></a><a href="#fn_1432"><font size="1">1433</font></a>
  from obscurity, and is brought into light, we are not censured as unrighteous who endeavour to perform the works of righteousness. No one any longer reproaches us with the name of God. None of us, who are alone of all men religious, is any more called irreligious; since despising the images of the dead, we worship the living and true God. The providence of the supreme Deity has raised thee to the imperial dignity, that thou mightest be able with true piety to rescind the injurious decrees of others, to correct faults, to provide with a fathers clemency for the safety of men,—in short, to remove the wicked from the state, whom being cast down by pre-eminent piety, God has delivered into your hands, that it might be evident to all in what true majesty consists.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vii.xxvi-p9"></a>For they who wished to take away the worship of the heavenly and matchless <a name="fr_1433"></a><a href="#fn_1433"><font size="1">1434</font></a>
  God, that they might defend impious superstitions, lie in ruin. <a name="fr_1434"></a><a href="#fn_1434"><font size="1">1435</font></a>
  But thou, who defendest and lovest His name, excelling in virtue and prosperity, enjoyest thy immortal glories with the greatest happiness. They suffer and have suffered the punishment of their guilt. The powerful right hand of God protects thee from all dangers; He bestows on thee a quiet and tranquil reign, with the highest congratulations of all men. And not undeservedly has the Lord and Ruler of the world chosen thee in preference to all others, by whom He might renew His holy religion, since thou alone didst exist of all, who mightest afford a surpassing example of virtue and holiness: in which thou mightest not only equal, but also, which is a very great matter, excel the glory of ancient princes, whom nevertheless fame reckons among the good. They indeed perhaps by nature only resembled the righteous. For he who is ignorant of God, the Ruler of the universe, may attain to a resemblance of righteousness, but he cannot attain to righteousness itself. But thou, both by the innate sanctity of thy character, and by thy acknowledgment of the truth and of God in every action, dost fully perform <a name="fr_1435"></a><a href="#fn_1435"><font size="1">1436</font></a>
  the works of <a name="page_222"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 222</font></a> <a name="iii.ii.vii.xxvi-Page_222"></a>righteousness. <a name="fr_1436"></a><a href="#fn_1436"><font size="1">1437</font></a>
  It was therefore befitting that, in arranging the condition of the human race, the Deity should make use of thy authority and service. Whom we supplicate with daily prayers, that He may especially guard thee whom He has wished to be the guardian of the world: then that He may inspire thee with a disposition by which thou mayest always continue in the love of the divine name. For this is serviceable to all, both to thee for happiness, and to others for repose.  </p>
