 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.v.xxviii-p1"></a>After the flight of <a name="iii.v.xxviii-p1.1"></a>Galerius, <a name="iii.v.xxviii-p1.2"></a>Maximian, having returned from Gaul, held authority in common with his son; but more obedience was yielded to the young man than to the old: for <a name="iii.v.xxviii-p1.3"></a>Maxentius had most power, and had been longest in possession of it; and it was to him that <a name="iii.v.xxviii-p1.4"></a>Maximian owed on this occasion the imperial dignity. The old man was impatient at being denied the exercise of uncontrolled sovereignty, and envied his son with a childish spirit of rivalry; and therefore he began to consider how he might expel <a name="iii.v.xxviii-p1.5"></a>Maxentius and resume his ancient dominion. This appeared easy, because the soldiers who deserted <a name="iii.v.xxviii-p1.6"></a>Severus had originally served in his own army. He called an assembly of the people of Rome, and of the soldiers, as if he had been to make an harangue on the calamitous situation of public affairs. After having spoken much on that subject, he stretched his hands towards his son, charged him as author of all ills and prime cause of the calamities of the state, and then tore the purple from his shoulders. <a name="iii.v.xxviii-p1.7"></a>Maxentius, thus stripped, leaped headlong from the tribunal, and was received into the arms of the soldiers. Their rage and clamour confounded the unnatural old man, and, like another <a name="iii.v.xxviii-p1.8"></a>Tarquin the Proud, he was driven from Rome.  </p>
