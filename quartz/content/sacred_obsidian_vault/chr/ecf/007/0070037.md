 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.ii.vii-p2"></a>The foolish, therefore, err in a twofold manner: first, in preferring the elements, that is, the works of God, to God <span><a name="iii.ii.ii.vii-p2.1"></a>Himself</span>; secondly, in worshipping the figures of the elements themselves under human form. For they form the images of the sun and moon after the fashion of men; also those of fire, and earth, and sea, which they call <a name="iii.ii.ii.vii-p2.2"></a>Vulcan, <a name="iii.ii.ii.vii-p2.3"></a>Vesta, and <a name="iii.ii.ii.vii-p2.4"></a>Neptune. Nor do they openly sacrifice to the elements themselves. Men are possessed with so great a fondness for representations, <a name="fr_175"></a><a href="#fn_175"><font size="1">176</font></a>
  that those things which are true are now esteemed of less value: they are delighted, in fact, with gold, and jewels, and ivory. The beauty and brilliancy of these things dazzle their eyes, and they think that there is no religion where these do not shine. And thus, under pretence of <span><a name="iii.ii.ii.vii-p3.1"></a>worshipping</span> the gods, avarice and desire are worshipped. For they believe that the gods love whatever they themselves desire, whatever it is, on account of which thefts and robberies and murders daily rage, on account of which wars overthrow nations and cities throughout the whole world. Therefore they consecrate their spoils and plunder to the gods, who must undoubtedly be weak, and destitute of the highest excellence, if they are subject to desires. For why should we think them celestial if they long for anything from the earth, or happy if they are in want of anything, or uncorrupted if they take pleasure in those things in the pursuit of which the desire of men is not unreservedly condemned? They approach the gods, therefore not so much on account of religion, which can have no place in badly acquired and corruptible things, as that they may gaze upon <a name="fr_176"></a><a href="#fn_176"><font size="1">177</font></a>
  the gold, and view the brilliancy of polished marble or ivory, that they may survey with unwearied contemplation garments adorned with precious stones and colours, or cups studded with glittering jewels. And the more ornamented are the temples, and the more beautiful the images, so much the greater majesty are they believed to have: so entirely is their religion confined <a name="fr_177"></a><a href="#fn_177"><font size="1">178</font></a>
  to that which the desire of men admires.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.ii.vii-p6"></a>These are the religious institutions handed down to them by their ancestors, which they persist in maintaining and defending with the greatest obstinacy. Nor do they consider of what character they are; but they feel assured of their excellence and truth on this account, because the ancients have handed them down; and so great is the authority of antiquity, that it is said to be a crime to inquire into it. And thus it is everywhere believed as ascertained truth. In short, in <a name="iii.ii.ii.vii-p6.1"></a>Cicero, <a name="fr_178"></a><a href="#fn_178"><font size="1">179</font></a>
  <a name="iii.ii.ii.vii-p7.4"></a>Cotta thus speaks to <a name="iii.ii.ii.vii-p7.5"></a>Lucilius: “You know, <a name="iii.ii.ii.vii-p7.6"></a>Balbus, what is the opinion of <a name="iii.ii.ii.vii-p7.7"></a>Cotta, what the opinion of the pontiff. Now let me understand what are your sentiments: for since you are a philosopher, I ought to receive from you a reason for your religion; but in the case of our ancestors it is reasonable to believe them, though no reason is alleged by them.” If you believe, why then do you require a reason, which may have the effect of causing you not to believe? But if you require a reason, and think that the subject demands inquiry, then you do not believe; for you make inquiry with this view, that you may follow it when you have ascertained it. Behold, reason teaches you that the religious institutions of the gods are not true: what will you do? Will you prefer to follow antiquity or reason? And this, indeed, was not imparted <a name="fr_179"></a><a href="#fn_179"><font size="1">180</font></a>
  to you by another, but was found out and chosen by yourself, since you have entirely uprooted all religious systems. If you prefer reason, you must abandon the institutions and authority of our ancestors, since nothing is right but that which reason prescribes. But if piety advises you to follow your ancestors, then admit that they were foolish, who complied with religious institutions invented contrary to reason; and that you are senseless, since you worship that which you have proved to be false. But since the name of ancestors is so greatly objected to us, let us see, I pray, who those ancestors were from whose authority it is said to be impious to depart. <a name="fr_180"></a><a href="#fn_180"><font size="1">181</font></a>

 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.ii.vii-p10"></a><a name="iii.ii.ii.vii-p10.1"></a>Romulus, when he was about to found the city, called together the shepherds among whom he had grown up; and since their number appeared inadequate to the founding of the city, he established an asylum. To this all the most abandoned men flocked together indiscriminately from the neighbouring places, without any distinction of condition. Thus he brought together the people from all these; and he chose into the senate those who were oldest, and called them Fathers, by whose advice he might direct all things. And concerning this senate, <a name="iii.ii.ii.vii-p10.2"></a>Propertius the elegiac poet thus speaks:—  </p>  <blockquote><a name="iii.ii.ii.vii-p10.3"></a>   “The trumpet used to call the ancient Quirites to an assembly; <a name="fr_181"></a><a href="#fn_181"><font size="1">182</font></a>
  those hundred in the field often formed the senate. The senate-house, which now is raised aloft and shines with the well-robed senate, received the Fathers clothed in skins, rustic spirits.”<br>  </blockquote>  
 <p class="Continue"><a name="iii.ii.ii.vii-p12"></a>These are the Fathers whose decrees learned and sagacious men obey with the greatest devotion; and all posterity must judge that to be true and unchangeable which an hundred old men clothed in skins established at their will; who, however, <a name="page_51"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 51</font></a> <a name="iii.ii.ii.vii-Page_51"></a>as has been mentioned in the first book, <a name="fr_182"></a><a href="#fn_182"><font size="1">183</font></a>
  were enticed by <a name="iii.ii.ii.vii-p13.1"></a>Pompilius to believe the truth of those sacred rites which he himself delivered. Is there any reason why their authority should be so highly esteemed by posterity, since during their life no one either high or low judged them worthy of affinity? <a name="fr_183"></a><a href="#fn_183"><font size="1">184</font></a>
