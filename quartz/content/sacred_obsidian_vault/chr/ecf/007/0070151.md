 <p> <a name="iii.ii.vi.xiii"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.vi.xiii-p0.1"></a>Chap. XIII.—Of Repentance, of Mercy, and the Forgiveness of Sins.</h4>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vi.xiii-p1"></a>As often, therefore, as you are asked for aid, believe that you are tried by God, that it may be seen whether you are worthy of being heard. Examine your own conscience, and, as far as you are able, heal your wounds. Nor, however, because offences are removed by bounty, think that a licence is given you for sinning. For they are done away with, if you are bountiful to God because you have sinned; for if you sin through reliance on your bounty, they are not done away with. For God especially desires that men shall be cleansed from their sins, and therefore He commands them to repent. But to repent is nothing else than to profess and to affirm that one will sin no more. Therefore they are pardoned who unawares and incautiously glide into sin; he who sins wilfully has no pardon. Nor, however, if any one shall have been purified from all stain of sin, let him think that he may abstain from the work of bounty because he has no faults to blot out. Nay, in truth, he is then more bound to exercise justice when he is become just, so that that which he had before done for the healing of his wounds he may afterwards do for the praise and glory of virtue. To this is added, that no one can be without fault as long as he is burthened with a covering of flesh, the infirmity of which is subject to the dominion of sin in a threefold manner—in deeds, in words, and thoughts.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vi.xiii-p2"></a>By these steps justice advances to the greatest height. The first step of virtue is to abstain from evil works; the second, to abstain also from evil words; the third, to abstain even from the thoughts of evil things. He who ascends the first step is sufficiently just; he who ascends the second is now of perfect virtue, since he offends neither in deeds nor in conversation; <a name="fr_1189"></a><a href="#fn_1189"><font size="1">1190</font></a>
  he who ascends the third appears truly to have attained the likeness of God. For it is almost beyond the measure of man not even to admit to the thought <a name="fr_1190"></a><a href="#fn_1190"><font size="1">1191</font></a>
  that which is either bad in action or improper in speech. Therefore even just men, who can refrain from every unjust work, are sometimes, however, overcome by frailty itself, so that they either speak evil in anger, or, at the sight of delightful things, they desire them with silent thought. But if the condition of mortality does not suffer a man to <a name="page_179"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 179</font></a> <a name="iii.ii.vi.xiii-Page_179"></a>be pure from every stain, the faults of the flesh ought therefore to be done away with by continual bounty. For it is the single work of a man who is wise, and just, and worthy of life, to lay out his riches on justice alone; for assuredly he who is without this, although he should surpass <a name="iii.ii.vi.xiii-p4.3"></a>Crœsus or <a name="iii.ii.vi.xiii-p4.4"></a>Crassus in riches, is to be esteemed as poor, as naked, as a beggar. Therefore we must use our efforts that we may be clothed with the garment of justice and piety, of which no one may deprive us, which may furnish us with an everlasting ornament. For if the worshippers of gods adore senseless images, and bestow upon them whatever they have which is precious, though they can neither make use of them nor give thanks because they have received them, how much more just and true is it to reverence the living images of God, that you may gain the favour of the living God! For as these make use of what they have received, and give thanks, so God, in whose sight you shall have done that which is good, will both approve of it and reward your piety.  </p>
