 <p> <a name="iii.ii.vi.i"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.vi.i-p0.1"></a>Chap. I.—Of the Worship of the True God, and of Innocency, and of the Worship of False Gods.</h4>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vi.i-p1"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iii.ii.vi.i-p1.1"></a>We</span> have completed that which was the object of our undertaking, through the teaching of the Divine Spirit, and the aid of the truth itself; the cause of asserting and explaining which was imposed upon me both by conscience and faith, and by our Lord Himself, without whom nothing can be known or clearly set forth. I come now to that which is the chief and greatest part of this work—to teach in what manner or by what sacrifice God must be worshipped. For that is the duty of man, and in that one object the sum of all things and the whole course of a happy life consists, since we were fashioned and received the breath of life from Him on this account, not that we might behold the heaven and the sun, as <a name="iii.ii.vi.i-p1.2"></a>Anaxagoras supposed, but that we might with pure and uncorrupted mind worship Him who made the sun and the heaven. But although in the preceding books, as far as my moderate talent permitted, I defended the truth, yet it may especially be elucidated <a name="fr_1076"></a><a href="#fn_1076"><font size="1">1077</font></a>
  by the mode of worship itself. For that sacred and surpassing majesty requires from man nothing more than innocence alone; and if any one has presented this to God, he has sacrificed with sufficient piety and religion. But men, neglecting justice, though they are polluted by crimes and outrages of all kinds, think themselves religious if they have stained the temples and altars with the blood of victims, if they have moistened the hearths with a profusion of fragrant and old wine. Moreover, they also prepare sacred feasts and choice banquets, as though they offered to those who would taste something from them. Whatever is rarely to be viewed, whatever is precious in workmanship or in fragrance, that they judge to be pleasing to their gods, not by any reference to their divinity, of which they are ignorant, but from their own desires; nor do they understand that God is in no want of earthly resources.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vi.i-p3"></a>For they have no knowledge of anything except the earth, and they estimate good and evil things by the perception and pleasure of the body alone. And as they judge of religion according to its pleasure, so also they arrange the acts of their whole life. And since they have turned away once for all from the contemplation of the heaven, and have made that heavenly faculty the slave of the body, they give the reins to their lusts, as though they were about to bear away pleasure with themselves, which they hasten to enjoy at every moment; whereas the soul ought to employ the service of the body, and not the body to make use of the service of the soul. The same men judge riches to be the greatest good. And if they cannot obtain them by good practices, they endeavour to obtain them by evil practices; they deceive, they carry off by violence, they plunder, they lie in wait, they deny on oath; in short, they have no consideration or regard for anything, <a name="fr_1077"></a><a href="#fn_1077"><font size="1">1078</font></a>
  if only they can glitter with gold, and shine conspicuous with plate, with jewels, and with garments, can spend riches upon their greedy appetite, and always walk attended with crowds of slaves through the people compelled to give way. <a name="fr_1078"></a><a href="#fn_1078"><font size="1">1079</font></a>
  Thus devoting <a name="fr_1079"></a><a href="#fn_1079"><font size="1">1080</font></a>
  themselves to the service of pleasures, they extinguish the force and vigour of the mind; and when they especially think that they are alive, they are hastening with the greatest precipitation to death. For, as we showed in the second book, the soul is concerned with heaven, the body with the earth. <a name="fr_1080"></a><a href="#fn_1080"><font size="1">1081</font></a>
  They who neglect the goods of the soul, and seek those of the body, <a name="page_163"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 163</font></a> <a name="iii.ii.vi.i-Page_163"></a>are engaged with darkness and death, which belong to the earth and to the body, because life and light are from heaven; and they who are without this, by serving the body, are far removed from the understanding of divine things. The same blindness everywhere oppresses the wretched men; for as they know not who is the true God, so they know not what constitutes true worship.  </p>
