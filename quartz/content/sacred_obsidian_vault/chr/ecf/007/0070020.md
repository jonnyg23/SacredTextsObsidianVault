 <p> <a name="iii.ii.i.xv"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.i.xv-p0.1"></a>Chap. xiv.—what the sacred history of euhemerus and ennius teaches concerning the gods.</h4>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.i.xv-p1"></a>Now, since the sacred history differs in some degree from those things which we have related, let us open those things which are contained in the true writings, that we may not, in accusing superstitions, appear to follow and approve of the follies of the poets. These are the words of <a name="iii.ii.i.xv-p1.1"></a>Ennius: “Afterwards <a name="iii.ii.i.xv-p1.2"></a>Saturn married <a name="iii.ii.i.xv-p1.3"></a>Ops. <a name="iii.ii.i.xv-p1.4"></a>Titan, who was older <span><a name="iii.ii.i.xv-p1.5"></a>than Saturn</span>, demands the kingdom for himself. Upon this their mother <a name="iii.ii.i.xv-p1.6"></a>Vesta, and their sisters <a name="iii.ii.i.xv-p1.7"></a>Ceres and Ops, advise Saturn not to give up the kingdom to his brother. Then Titan, who was inferior in person to Saturn, on that account, and because he saw that his mother and sisters were using their endeavours that Saturn might reign, yielded the kingdom to him. He therefore made an agreement with Saturn, that if any male children should be born to him, he would not bring them up. He did so for this purpose, that the kingdom might return to his own sons. Then, when a son was first born to Saturn, they slew him. Afterwards twins were born, <a name="iii.ii.i.xv-p1.8"></a>Jupiter and <a name="iii.ii.i.xv-p1.9"></a>Juno. Upon this they present <a name="iii.ii.i.xv-p1.10"></a>Juno to the sight of Saturn, and secretly hide <a name="iii.ii.i.xv-p1.11"></a>Jupiter, and give him to Vesta to be brought up, concealing him from Saturn. Ops also brings forth <a name="iii.ii.i.xv-p1.12"></a>Neptune without the knowledge of Saturn, and secretly hides him. In the same manner Ops brings forth twins by a third birth, <a name="iii.ii.i.xv-p1.13"></a>Pluto and <a name="iii.ii.i.xv-p1.14"></a>Glauca. Pluto in Latin is <a name="iii.ii.i.xv-p1.15"></a>Dispater; others call him <a name="iii.ii.i.xv-p1.16"></a>Orcus. Upon this they show to Saturn the daughter Glauca, and conceal and hide the son Pluto. Then Glauca dies while yet young.” This is the lineage of <a name="iii.ii.i.xv-p1.17"></a>Jupiter and his brothers, <span><a name="iii.ii.i.xv-p1.18"></a>as these things are written</span>, and the relationship is handed down to us after this manner from the sacred narrative. Also shortly afterwards he introduces these things: “Then Titan, when he learned that sons were born to Saturn, and secretly brought up, secretly takes with him his sons, who are called Titans, and seizes his brother Saturn and Ops, and encloses them within a wall, and places over them a guard.”  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.i.xv-p2"></a>The truth of this history is taught by the <a name="iii.ii.i.xv-p2.1"></a>Erythræan Sibyl, who speaks almost the same things, with a few discrepancies, which do not affect the subject-matter itself. Therefore <a name="iii.ii.i.xv-p2.2"></a>Jupiter is freed from the charge of the greatest wickedness, according to which he is reported to have bound his father with fetters; for this was the deed of his uncle <a name="iii.ii.i.xv-p2.3"></a>Titan, because he, contrary to his promise and oath, had brought up male children. The rest of the history is thus put together. <span><a name="iii.ii.i.xv-p2.4"></a>It is said </span>that <a name="iii.ii.i.xv-p2.5"></a>Jupiter, when grown up, having heard that his father and mother had been surrounded with a guard and imprisoned, came with a great multitude of Cretans, and conquered <a name="iii.ii.i.xv-p2.6"></a>Titan and his sons in an engagement, and rescued his parents from imprisonment, restored the kingdom to his father, and thus returned into Crete. Then, after these things, <span><a name="iii.ii.i.xv-p2.7"></a>they say</span> that an oracle was given to <a name="iii.ii.i.xv-p2.8"></a>Saturn, bidding him to take heed lest his son should expel him from the kingdom; that he, for the sake of weakening the oracle and avoiding the danger, laid an ambush for <a name="iii.ii.i.xv-p2.9"></a>Jupiter to kill him; that <a name="iii.ii.i.xv-p2.10"></a>Jupiter, having learned the plot, claimed the kingdom for himself afresh, and banished Saturn; and that he, when he had been tossed over all lands, followed by armed men whom <a name="iii.ii.i.xv-p2.11"></a>Jupiter had sent to seize or put him to death, scarcely found a place of concealment in Italy.  </p>
