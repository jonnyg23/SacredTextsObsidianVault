 <p> <a name="iii.iii.x"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iii.iii.x-p0.1"></a>Chap. X.—Of the Origin of the World, and the Nature of Affairs, and the Providence of God.</h4>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.iii.x-p1"></a>They who do not admit that the world was made by divine providence, either say that it is composed of first principles coming together at random, or that it suddenly came into existence by nature, but hold, as <a name="iii.iii.x-p1.1"></a>Straton <a name="fr_1670"></a><a href="#fn_1670"><font size="1">1671</font></a>
  does, that nature has in itself the power of production and of diminution, but that it has neither sensibility nor figure, so that we may understand that all things were produced spontaneously, without any artificer or author. Each opinion is vain and impossible. But this happens to those who are ignorant of the truth, that they devise anything, rather than perceive that which the nature of the subject <a name="fr_1671"></a><a href="#fn_1671"><font size="1">1672</font></a>
  requires. First of all, with respect to those minute seeds, by the meeting together of which they say that the whole world came into existence, <a name="fr_1672"></a><a href="#fn_1672"><font size="1">1673</font></a>
  I ask where or whence they are. Who has seen them at any time? Who has perceived them? Who has heard them? Had none but <a name="iii.iii.x-p4.2"></a>Leucippus <a name="fr_1673"></a><a href="#fn_1673"><font size="1">1674</font></a>
  eyes? Had he alone a mind, who assuredly alone of all men was blind and senseless, since he spoke those things which no sick man could have uttered in his ravings, <a name="fr_1674"></a><a href="#fn_1674"><font size="1">1675</font></a>
  or one asleep in his dreams?  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.iii.x-p7"></a>The ancient philosophers argued that all things were made up of four elements. <a name="fr_1675"></a><a href="#fn_1675"><font size="1">1676</font></a>
  He would not admit this, lest he should appear to tread in the footsteps of others; but he held that there were other first principles of the elements themselves, which can neither be seen, nor touched, nor be perceived by any part of the body. They are so minute, he says, that there is no edge of a sword so fine that they can be cut and divided by it. From which circumstance he gave them the name of atoms. But it occurred to him, that if they all had one and the same nature, they could not make up different objects of so great a variety as we see to be present in the world. He said, therefore, that there were smooth and rough ones, and round, and angular, and hooked. How much better had it been to be silent, than to have a tongue for such miserable and empty uses! And, indeed, I fear lest he who thinks these things worthy of refutation, should appear no less to rave. Let us, however, reply as to one who says something. <a name="fr_1676"></a><a href="#fn_1676"><font size="1">1677</font></a>
  If they are soft <a name="fr_1677"></a><a href="#fn_1677"><font size="1">1678</font></a>
  and round, it is plain that they cannot lay hold of one another, so as to make some body; as, though any one should wish to bind together millet into one combination, <a name="fr_1678"></a><a href="#fn_1678"><font size="1">1679</font></a>
  the very softness of the grains would not permit them to come together into a mass. If they are rough, and angular, and hooked, so that they may be able to cohere, then they are divisible, and capable of being cut; for hooks and angles must project, <a name="fr_1679"></a><a href="#fn_1679"><font size="1">1680</font></a>
  so that they may possibly be cut off.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.iii.x-p13"></a>Therefore that which is able to be cut off and torn away, will be able both to be seen and held. “These,” he says, “flutter about with restless motions through empty space, and are carried hither and thither, just as we see little particles of dust in the sun when it has introduced its rays and light through a window. From these there arise trees and herbs, and all fruits of the earth; from these, animals, and water, and fire, and all things are produced, and are again resolved into the same elements.” This can be borne as long as the inquiry is respecting small matters. Even the world itself was made up of these. He has reached to the full extent of perfect madness: it seems impossible that anything further should be said, and yet he found something to add. “Since everything,” he says, “is infinite, and nothing can be empty, it follows of necessity that there are innumerable worlds.” What force of atoms had been so great, that masses so incalculable should be collected from such minute elements? And first of all I ask, What is the nature or origin of those seeds? For if all things are from them, whence shall we say that they themselves are? What nature supplied such an abundance of matter for the making of innumerable worlds? But let us grant that he raved with impunity concerning worlds; let us speak respecting this in which we are, and which we see. He says that all things are made from minute bodies which are incapable of division.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.iii.x-p14"></a>If this were so, no object would ever need the seed of its own kind. Birds would be born without eggs, or eggs without bringing forth; likewise the rest of the living creatures without coition: trees and the productions of the earth would not have their own seeds, which we daily handle and sow. Why does a corn-field arise from grain, and again grain from a corn-field? In short, if the meeting together and collecting <a name="page_266"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 266</font></a> <a name="iii.iii.x-Page_266"></a>of atoms would effect all things, all things would grow together in the air, since atoms flutter about through empty space. Why cannot the herb, why cannot the tree or grain, arise or be increased without earth, without roots, without moisture, without seed? From which it is evident that nothing is made up from atoms, since everything has its own peculiar and fixed nature, its own seed, its own law given from the beginning. Finally, <a name="iii.iii.x-p14.1"></a>Lucretius, as though forgetful of atoms, <a name="fr_1680"></a><a href="#fn_1680"><font size="1">1681</font></a>
  which he was maintaining, in order that he might refute those who say that all things are produced from nothing, employed these arguments, which might have weighed against himself. For he thus spoke:—  </p>  <blockquote><a name="iii.iii.x-p15.2"></a>   “If things came from nothing, any kind might be born of anything; nothing would require seed.” <a name="fr_1681"></a><a href="#fn_1681"><font size="1">1682</font></a>
  <br>  </blockquote>  
 <p class="Continue"><a name="iii.iii.x-p17"></a>Likewise afterwards:—  </p>  <blockquote><a name="iii.iii.x-p17.1"></a>   “We must admit, therefore, that nothing can come from nothing, since things require seed before they can severally be born, and be brought out into the buxom fields of air.” <a name="fr_1682"></a><a href="#fn_1682"><font size="1">1683</font></a>
  <br>  </blockquote>  
 <p class="Continue"><a name="iii.iii.x-p19"></a>Who would imagine that he had brain when he said these things, and did not see that they were contrary to one another? For that nothing is made by means of atoms, is apparent from this, that everything has a definite <a name="fr_1683"></a><a href="#fn_1683"><font size="1">1684</font></a>
  seed, unless by chance we shall believe that the nature both of fire and water is derived from atoms. Why should I say, that if materials of the greatest hardness are struck together with a violent blow, fire is struck out? Are atoms concealed in the steel, or in the flint? Who shut them in? Or why do they not leap forth spontaneously? Or how could the seeds of fire remain in a material of the greatest coldness?  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.iii.x-p21"></a>I leave the subject of the flint and steel. If you hold in the sun an orb of crystal filled with water, fire is kindled from the light which is reflected from the water, even in the most severe cold. Must we then believe that fire is contained in the water? And yet fire cannot be kindled from the sun even in summer. If you shall breathe upon wax, or if a light vapour shall touch anything—either the hard surface <a name="fr_1684"></a><a href="#fn_1684"><font size="1">1685</font></a>
  of marble or a plate of metal—water is gradually condensed by means of the most minute drops. Also from the exhalation of the earth or sea mist is formed, which either, being dispersed, moistens whatever it has covered, or being collected, is carried aloft by the wind to high mountains, and compressed into cloud, and sends down great rains. Where, then, do we say that fluids are produced? Is it in the vapour? Or in the exhalation? Or in the wind? But nothing can be formed in that which is neither touched nor seen. Why should I speak of animals, in whose bodies we see nothing formed without plan, without arrangement, without utility, without beauty, so that the most skilful and careful marking out <a name="fr_1685"></a><a href="#fn_1685"><font size="1">1686</font></a>
  of all the parts and members repels the idea of accident and chance? But let us suppose it possible that the limbs, and bones, and nerves, and blood should be made up of atoms. What of the senses, the reflection, the memory, the mind, the natural capacity: from what seeds can they be compacted?  <a name="fr_1686"></a><a href="#fn_1686"><font size="1">1687</font></a>
  He says, From the most minute. There are therefore others of greater size. How, then, are they indivisible?  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.iii.x-p25"></a>In the next place, if the things which are not seen are formed from invisible seeds, it follows that those which are seen are from visible seeds. Why, then, does no one see them? But whether any one regards the invisible parts which are in man, or the parts which can be touched, and which are visible, who does not see that both parts exist in accordance with design?  <a name="fr_1687"></a><a href="#fn_1687"><font size="1">1688</font></a>
  How, then, can bodies which meet together without design effect anything reasonable?  <a name="fr_1688"></a><a href="#fn_1688"><font size="1">1689</font></a>
  For we see that there is nothing in the whole world which has not in itself very great and wonderful design. And since this is above the sense and capacity of man, to what can it be more rightly attributed than to the divine providence? If a statue, the resemblance of man, is made by the exercise of design and art, shall we suppose that man himself is made up of fragments which come together at random? And what resemblance to the truth is there in the thing produced,  <a name="fr_1689"></a><a href="#fn_1689"><font size="1">1690</font></a>
  when the greatest and most surpassing skill <a name="fr_1690"></a><a href="#fn_1690"><font size="1">1691</font></a>
  can imitate nothing more than the mere outline and extreme lineaments <a name="fr_1691"></a><a href="#fn_1691"><font size="1">1692</font></a>
  of the body? Was the skill of man able to give to his production any motion or sensibility? I say nothing of the exercise of the sight, of hearing, and of smelling, and the wonderful uses of the other members, either those which are in sight or those which are hidden from view. What artificer could have fabricated either the heart of man, or the voice, or his very wisdom? Does any man of sound mind, therefore, think that that which man cannot do by reason and judgment, may be accomplished by a meeting together of atoms everywhere adhering to each other? You see into what foolish ravings they have fallen, while they are unwilling to assign to God the making and the care of all things  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.iii.x-p31"></a>Let us, however, concede to them that the things which are earthly are made from atoms: are the things also which are heavenly? They <a name="page_267"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 267</font></a> <a name="iii.iii.x-Page_267"></a>say that the gods are without contamination, eternal, and blessed; and they grant to them alone an exemption, so that they do not appear to be made up of a meeting together of atoms. For if the gods also had been made up of these, they would be liable to be dispersed, the seeds at length being resolved, and returning to their own nature. Therefore, if there is something which the atoms could not produce, why may we not judge in the same way of the others? But I ask why the gods did not build for themselves a dwelling-place before those first elements produced the world? It is manifest that, unless the atoms had come together and made the heaven, the gods would still be suspended through the midst of empty space. By what counsel, then, by what plan, did the atoms from a confused mass collect themselves, so that from some the earth below was formed into a globe, and the heaven stretched out above, adorned with so great a variety of constellations that nothing can be conceived more embellished? Can he, therefore, who sees such and so great objects, imagine that they were made without any design, without any providence, without any divine intelligence, but that such great and wonderful things arose out of fine and minute atoms? Does it not resemble a prodigy, that there should be any human being who might say these things, or that there should be those who might believe them—as <a name="iii.iii.x-p31.1"></a>Democritus, who was his hearer, or <a name="iii.iii.x-p31.2"></a>Epicurus, to whom all folly flowed forth from the fountain of <a name="iii.iii.x-p31.3"></a>Leucippus? But, as others say, the world was made by Nature, which is without perception and figure. <a name="fr_1692"></a><a href="#fn_1692"><font size="1">1693</font></a>
  But this is much more absurd. If Nature made the world, it must have made it by judgment and intelligence; for it is he that makes something who has either the inclination to make it, or knowledge. If nature is without perception and figure, how can that be made by it which has both perception and figure, unless by chance any one thinks that the fabric of animals, which is so delicate, could have been formed and animated by that which is without perception, or that that figure of heaven, which is prepared with such foresight for the uses of living beings, suddenly came into existence by some accident or other, without a builder, without an artificer?  <a name="fr_1693"></a><a href="#fn_1693"><font size="1">1694</font></a>
    </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.iii.x-p34"></a>“If there is anything,” says <a name="iii.iii.x-p34.1"></a>Chrysippus, “which effects those things which man, though he is endowed with reason, cannot do, that assuredly is greater, and stronger, and wiser than man.” But man cannot make heavenly things; therefore that which shall produce or has produced these things surpasses man in art, in design, in skill, and in power. Who, therefore, can it be but God? But Nature, which they suppose to be, as it were, the mother of all things, if it has not a mind, will effect nothing, will contrive nothing; for where there is no reflection there is neither motion nor efficacy. But if it uses counsel for the commencement of anything, reason for its arrangement, art for its accomplishment, energy for its consummation, and power to govern and control, why should it be called Nature rather than God? Or if a concourse of atoms, or Nature without mind, made those things which we see, I ask why it was able to make the heaven, but unable to make a city or a house?  <a name="fr_1694"></a><a href="#fn_1694"><font size="1">1695</font></a>
  Why it made mountains of marble, but did not make columns and statues? But ought not atoms to have come together to effect these things, since they leave no position untried? For concerning Nature, which has no mind, it is no wonder that it forgot to do these things. What, then, is the case? It is plain that God, when He commenced this work of the world,—than which nothing can be better arranged with respect to order, nor more befitting as to utility, nor more adorned as to beauty, nor greater as to bulk,—Himself made the things which could not be made by man; and among these also man himself, to whom He gave a portion of His own wisdom, and furnished him with reason, as much as earthly frailty was capable of receiving, that he might make for himself the things which were necessary for his own uses.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.iii.x-p36"></a>But if in the commonwealth of this world, so to speak, there is no providence which rules, no God who administers, no sense at all prevails in this nature of things. From what source therefore will it be believed that the human mind, with its skill and its intelligence, had its origin? For if the body of man was made from the ground, from which circumstance man received his name; <a name="fr_1695"></a><a href="#fn_1695"><font size="1">1696</font></a>
  it follows that the soul, which has intelligence, and is the ruler of the body, which the limbs obey as a king and commander, which can neither be looked upon nor comprehended, could not have come to man except from a wise nature. But as mind and soul govern everybody, so also does God govern the world. For it is not probable that lesser and humble things bear rule, but that greater and highest things do not bear rule. In short, <a name="iii.iii.x-p37.2"></a>Marcus Cicero, in his <a name="iii.iii.x-p37.3"></a>Tusculan Disputations, <a name="fr_1696"></a><a href="#fn_1696"><font size="1">1697</font></a>
  and in his <a name="iii.iii.x-p38.1"></a>Consolation, says: “No origin of souls can be found on earth. For there is nothing, he says, mixed and compound <a name="fr_1697"></a><a href="#fn_1697"><font size="1">1698</font></a>
  in souls, or which may appear to be produced and made up from the earth; nothing moist or airy, <a name="fr_1698"></a><a href="#fn_1698"><font size="1">1699</font></a>
  or of the nature of fire. <a name="page_268"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 268</font></a> <a name="iii.iii.x-Page_268"></a>For in these natures there is nothing which has the force of memory, of mind and reflection, which both retains the past and foresees the future, and is able to comprise the present; which things alone are divine. For no source will ever be found from which they are able to come to man, unless it be from God.” Since, therefore, with the exception of two or three vain calumniators, it is agreed upon that the world is governed by providence, as also it was made, and there is no one who ventures to prefer the opinion of Diagoras and Theodorus, or the empty fiction of Leucippus, or the levity of <a name="iii.iii.x-p40.2"></a>Democritus and <a name="iii.iii.x-p40.3"></a>Epicurus, either to the authority of those seven ancient men who were called wise, <a name="fr_1699"></a><a href="#fn_1699"><font size="1">1700</font></a>
  or to that of <a name="iii.iii.x-p41.4"></a>Pythagoras or of <a name="iii.iii.x-p41.5"></a>Socrates or <a name="iii.iii.x-p41.6"></a>Plato, and the other philosophers who judged that there is a providence; therefore that opinion also is false, by which they think that religion was instituted by wise men for the sake of terror and fear, in order that ignorant men might abstain from sins.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.iii.x-p42"></a>But if this is true, it follows that we are derided by the wise men of old. But if they invented religion for the sake of deceiving us, and moreover of deceiving the whole human race, therefore they were not wise, because falsehood is not consistent with the character of the wise man. But grant that they were wise; what great success in falsehood was it, that they were able to deceive not only the unlearned, but <a name="iii.iii.x-p42.1"></a>Plato also, and <a name="iii.iii.x-p42.2"></a>Socrates, and so easily to delude <a name="iii.iii.x-p42.3"></a>Pythagoras, <a name="iii.iii.x-p42.4"></a>Zeno, and <a name="iii.iii.x-p42.5"></a>Aristotle, the chiefs of the greatest sects? There is therefore a divine providence, as those men whom I have named perceived, by the energy and power of which all things which we see were both made and are governed. For so vast a system of things <a name="fr_1700"></a><a href="#fn_1700"><font size="1">1701</font></a>
  such arrangement and such regularity in preserving the settled orders and times, could neither at first have arisen without a provident artificer, or have existed so many ages without a powerful inhabitant, or have been perpetually governed without a skilful and intelligent <a name="fr_1701"></a><a href="#fn_1701"><font size="1">1702</font></a>
  ruler; and reason itself declares this. For whatever exists which has reason, must have arisen from reason. Now reason is the part of an intelligent and wise nature; but a wise and intelligent nature can be nothing else than God. Now the world, since it has reason, by which it is both governed and kept together, was therefore made by God. But if God is the maker and ruler of the world, then religion is rightly and truly established; for honour and worship are due to the author and common parent of all things.  </p>
