 <p class="c10"><a name="iv.x.v-p2"></a>For we Catholic Christians worship God, from whom are all good things whether great or small; from whom is all measure great or small; from whom is all form great or small; from whom is all order great or small.  For all things in proportion as they are better measured, formed, and ordered, are assuredly good in a higher degree; but in proportion as they are measured, formed, and ordered in an inferior degree, are they the less good.  These three things, therefore, measure, form, and order,—not to speak of innumerable other things that are shown to pertain to these three,—these three things, therefore, measure, form, order, are as it were generic goods in things made by God, whether in spirit or in body.  God is, therefore, above every measure of the creature, above every form, above every order, nor is He above by local spaces, but by ineffable and singular potency, from whom is every measure, every form, every order.  These three things, where they are great, are great goods, where they are small, are small goods; where they are absent, there is no good.  And again where these things are great, there are great natures, where they are small, there are small natures, where they are absent, there is no nature.  Therefore all nature is good.</p>
