 <p class="c10"><a name="iv.x.viii-p2"></a>But if corruption take away all measure, all form, all order from corruptible things, no nature will remain.  And consequently every nature which cannot be corrupted is the highest good, as is God.  But every nature that can be corrupted is also itself some good; for corruption cannot injure it, except by taking away from or diminishing that which is good.</p>
