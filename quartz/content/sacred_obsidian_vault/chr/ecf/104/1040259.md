  who associates with the congregation of the saints in carnal obstinacy.  Yet we ought to despair of no man, whether he be one who shows himself to be of this nature within the pale of the Church, or whether he more openly opposes it from without.  But the spiritual, or those who are steadily advancing with pious exertion towards this end, do not stray without the pale; since even when, by some perversity or necessity among men, they seem to be driven forth, they are more   approved than if they had remained within, since they are in no degree roused to contend against the Church, but remain rooted in the strongest foundation of Christian charity on the solid rock of unity.  For hereunto belongs what is said in the sacrifice of Abraham:  "But the birds divided he not." <a name="fr_1195"></a><a href="#fn_1195"><font size="1">1196</font></a>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="v.iv.iii.xvii-p2"></a> In the <i>Retractations</i>, ii. 18, Augustin notes on this passage, that wherever he uses this quotation from the Epistle to the Ephesians, he means it to be understood of the progress of the Church towards this condition, and not of her success in its attainment; for at present the infirmities and ignorance of her members give ground enough for the whole Church joining daily in the petition, "Forgive us our debts."</p>
