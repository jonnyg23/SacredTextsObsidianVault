 </p><p class="c41"><a name="v.iv.viii.xi-p1"></a> <span class="c11"><a name="v.iv.viii.xi-p1.1"></a>Chapter 11.—</span>16.  Novatus of Thamugadis <a name="fr_1607"></a><a href="#fn_1607"><font size="1">1608</font></a>
  said:  "Though we know that all Scripture gives its testimony respecting saving baptism, yet we ought to express our belief that heretics and schismatics, coming to the Church with the semblance of having been baptized, ought to be baptized in the unfailing fountain; and that therefore, according to the testimony of the Scriptures, and according to the decree of those most holy men, our colleagues, <a name="fr_1608"></a><a href="#fn_1608"><font size="1">1609</font></a>
  all schismatics and heretics who are converted to the Church ought to be baptized; and that, moreover, all that seemed to have received ordination should be admitted as simple laymen."</p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="v.iv.viii.xi-p4"></a>17.  Novatus of Thamugadis has stated what he has done, but he has brought forward no proofs by which to show that he ought to have acted as he did.  For he has made mention of the testimony of the Scriptures, and the decree of his colleagues, but he has not adduced out of them anything which we could consider.</p>
