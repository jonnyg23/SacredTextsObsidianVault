 <p class="c10"><a name="iv.x.xxx-p2"></a>But when we hear:  "All things are from Him, and through Him, and in Him," we ought assuredly to understand all natures which naturally exist.  For sins, which do not preserve but vitiate nature, are not from Him; which sins, Holy Scripture in many ways testifies, are from the will of those sinning, especially in the passage where the apostle says:  "But dost thou suppose this, O man, that judgest those who do such things, and doest them, that thou shall escape the judgment of God?  Or dost thou despise the riches of His goodness, and patience, and long-suffering, not knowing that the patience of God leadeth thee to repentance?  But according to the hardness of thy heart and thy impenitent heart, thou treasurest up for thyself wrath against the day of wrath and of the revelation of the just judgment of God, who will render unto every one according to his works." <a name="fr_1108"></a><a href="#fn_1108"><font size="1">1109</font></a>
