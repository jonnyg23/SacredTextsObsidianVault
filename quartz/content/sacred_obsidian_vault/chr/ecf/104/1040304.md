 </p><p class="c41"><a name="v.iv.vi.vi-p1"></a> <span class="c11"><a name="v.iv.vi.vi-p1.1"></a>Chapter 6.—</span>9.  But as regards his saying, "Nor let any one affirm that what they have received from the apostles, that they follow; for the apostles handed down only one Church and one baptism, and that appointed only in the same Church:" <a name="fr_1365"></a><a href="#fn_1365"><font size="1">1366</font></a>
   this does not so much move me to venture to condemn the baptism of Christ when found amongst heretics (just as it is necessary to recognize the gospel itself when I find it with them, though I abominate their error), as it warns me that there were some even in the times of the holy Cyprian who traced to the authority of the apostles that custom against which the African Councils were held, and in respect of which he himself said a little above, "In vain do those who are   beaten by reason oppose to us the authority of custom."  Nor do I find the reason why the same Cyprian found this very custom, which after his time was confirmed by nothing less than a plenary Council of the whole world, already so strong before his time, that when with all his learning he sought an authority worth following for changing it, he found nothing but a Council of Agrippinus held in Africa a very few years before his own time.  And seeing that this was not enough for him, as against   the custom of the whole world, he laid hold on these reasons which we just now, considering them with great care, and being confirmed by the antiquity of the custom itself, and by the subsequent authority of a plenary Council, found to be truth-like rather than true; which, however, seemed to him true, as he toiled in a question of the greatest obscurity, and was in doubt about the remission of sins,—whether it could fail to be given in the baptism of Christ, and whether it could be given among   heretics.  In which matter, if an imperfect revelation of the truth was given to Cyprian, that the greatness of his love in not deserting the unity of the Church might be made manifest, there is yet not any reason why any one should venture to claim superiority over the strong defenses and excellence of his virtues, and the abundance of graces which were found in him, merely because, with the instruction derived from the strength of a general Council, he sees something which Cyprian did not   see, because the Church had not yet held a plenary Council on the matter.  Just as no one is so insane as to set himself up as surpassing the merits of the Apostle Peter, because, taught by the epistles of the Apostle Paul, and confirmed by the custom of the Church herself, he does not compel the Gentiles to judaize, as Peter once had done. <a name="fr_1366"></a><a href="#fn_1366"><font size="1">1367</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c10"><a name="v.iv.vi.vi-p4"></a>10.  We do not then "find that any one, after being baptized among heretics, was afterwards admitted by the apostles with the same baptism, and communicated;" <a name="fr_1367"></a><a href="#fn_1367"><font size="1">1368</font></a>
  but neither do we find this, that any one coming from the society of heretics, who had been baptized among them, was baptized anew by the apostles.  But this custom, which even then those who looked back to past ages could not find to have been invented by men of a later time, is rightly believed to have been handed down from the apostles.  And there are many other things of the same kind, which it would be tedious to recount.  Wherefore, if they had something to say for   themselves to whom Cyprian, wishing to persuade them of the truth of his own view, says, "Let no one say, What we have received from the apostles, that we follow," with how much more force we now say, What the custom of the Church has always held, what this argument has failed to prove false, and what a plenary Council has confirmed, this we follow!  To this we may add that it may also be said, after a careful inquiry into the reasoning on both sides of the discussion, and into the   evidence <a name="page_451"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 451</font></a> <a name="v.iv.vi.vi-Page_451"></a>of Scripture, What truth has declared, that we follow.</p>
