  <a name="page_435"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 435</font></a> <a name="v.iv.iv.xv-Page_435"></a>whither are ye going, ye wretched men?  What are ye doing?  You are bound to fly even from yourselves, because you have advanced beyond the position where he abode.  But if neither his own sins nor those of others could stand in his way, on account of the abundance of his charity and his love of brotherly kindness and the bond of peace, do you return to us, where you will find much less hindrance in the way of either us or you from the fictions which   your party have invented.</p>
