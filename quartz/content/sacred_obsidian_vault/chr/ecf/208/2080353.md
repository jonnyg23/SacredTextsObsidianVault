 <p class="c20"><a name="ix.cclxxxi-p4"></a>I <span class="c14"><a name="ix.cclxxxi-p4.1"></a>feel</span> my boldness in pressing my suit by letter upon a man in your position; still the honour that you have paid me in the past has banished all my scruples.  Accordingly I write with confidence.</p>  
 <p class="c21"><a name="ix.cclxxxi-p5"></a>My plea is for a relative of mine, a man worthy of respect for his integrity.  He is the bearer of this letter, and he stands to me in the place of a son.  Your favour is all that he requires for the fulfilment of his wishes.  Deign therefore to receive, at the hands of the aforesaid bearer, my letter in furtherance of his plea.  I pray you to give him an opportunity of explaining his affairs at an interview with those in a position to help him.  So by your direction shall he quickly obtain his desires; while I shall have occasion for boasting that by Gods favour I have found a champion who regards the entreaties of my friends as personal claims to his protection.</p>
