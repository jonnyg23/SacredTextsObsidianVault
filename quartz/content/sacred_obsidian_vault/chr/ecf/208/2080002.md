 <p class="c2"><a name="iii-p2"></a> ————————————</p>  
 <p class="c20"><a name="iii-p3"></a><span class="c14"><a name="iii-p3.1"></a>This</span> translation of a portion of the works of St. Basil was originally begun under the editorial supervision of Dr. Wace.  It was first announced that the translation would comprise the <i>De Spiritu Sancto</i> and <i>Select Letters</i>, but it was ultimately arranged with Dr. Wace that a volume of the series should be devoted to St. Basil, containing, as well as the <i>De Spiritu Sancto</i>, the whole of the <i>Letters</i>, and the <i>Hexæmeron</i>.  The <i>De Spiritu Sancto</i> has already appeared in an English form, as have portions of the <i>Letters</i>, but I am not aware of an English translation of the <i>Hexæmeron</i>, or of all the <i>Letters</i>.  The <i>De Spiritu Sancto</i> was presumably selected for publication as being at once the most famous, as it is among the most valuable, of the extant works of this Father.  The <i>Letters</i> comprise short theological treatises and contain passages of historical and varied biographical interest, as well as valuable specimens of spiritual and consolatory exhortation.  The <i>Hexæmeron</i> was added as being the most noted and popular of St. Basils compositions in older days, and as illustrating his exegetic method and skill, and his power as an extempore preacher.</p>  
 <p class="c21"><a name="iii-p4"></a>The edition used has been that of the Benedictine editors as issued by Migne, with the aid, in the case of the <i>De Spiritu Sancto</i>, of that published by Rev. C. F. H. Johnston.</p>  
 <p class="c21"><a name="iii-p5"></a>The editorship of Dr. Wace terminated during the progress of the work, but I am indebted to him, and very gratefully acknowledge the obligation, for valuable counsel and suggestions.  I also desire to record my thanks to the Rev. C. Hole, Lecturer in Ecclesiastical History at Kings College, London, and to Mr. Reginald Geare, Head Master of the Grammar School, Bishops Stortford, to the former for help in the revision of proof-sheets and important suggestions, and to the latter for aid in the translation of several of the <i>Letters</i>.</p>  
 <p class="c21"><a name="iii-p6"></a>The works consulted in the process of translation and attempted illustration are sufficiently indicated in the notes.</p>
