 <p class="c20"><a name="ix.cclxxiv-p4"></a><span class="c14"><a name="ix.cclxxiv-p4.1"></a>I am</span> sure that your excellency loves me well enough to regard all that concerns me as concerning you.  Therefore I commend to your great kindness and high consideration my very reverend brother Hera, whom I do not merely call brother by any conventional phrase, but because of his boundless affection.  I beseech you to regard him as though he were nearly connected with yourself, and, so far as you can, to give him your protection in the matters in which he requires your generous and thoughtful aid.  I shall then have this one more kindness to reckon in addition to the many which I have already received at your hands.</p>
