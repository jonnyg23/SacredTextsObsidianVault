  I have known you as well, and I have been as completely captured by you, as though I had long lived with you and had practical experience of your excellent qualities.  For he did not cease telling me about you, mentioning one by one your magnanimity, your exalted sentiments, your mild manners, your skill in business, intelligence, dignity tempered by cheerfulness, and eloquence.  All the other points that he enumerated in his long conversation with me it is impossible for me to write to you, without extending my letter beyond all reasonable bounds.  How can I fail to love such a man?  How could I put such restraint upon myself as not loudly to proclaim what I feel?  Accept then, most excellent Sir, the greeting which I send you, for it is inspired by true and unfeigned friendship.  I abhor all servile compliment.  Pray keep me enrolled in the list of your friends, and, by frequently writing to me, bring yourself before me and comfort me in your absence.</p>
