 <p class="c20"><a name="ix.lxix-p4"></a><span class="c14"><a name="ix.lxix-p4.1"></a>I wished</span> to detain the reverend brother Dorotheus, the deacon, so long at my side, with the object of keeping him until the end of the negociations, and so by him acquainting your excellency with every detail.  But day after day went by; the delay was becoming protracted; now, the moment that some plan, so far as is possible in my difficulties, has occurred to me concerning the course to be taken, I send him to approach your holiness, to make a personal report to you on all the circumstances, and show you my memorandum, to the end that, if what has occurred to me seems to you to be likely to be of service, your excellency may urge on its accomplishment.  To be brief, the opinion has prevailed that it is best for this our brother Dorotheus to travel to Rome, to move some of the Italians to undertake a voyage by sea to visit us, that they may avoid all who would put difficulties in their way.  My reason for this course is that I see that those, who are all powerful with the Emperor, are neither willing nor able to make any suggestion to him about the <a name="page_165"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 165</font></a> <a name="ix.lxix-Page_165"></a>exiled, but only count it so much to the good that they see no worse thing befalling the Churches.  If, then, my plan seems good also to your prudence, you will be good enough both to indite letters and dictate memoranda as to the points on which he must enlarge, and as to whom he had better address himself.  And so that your despatches may have weight and authority, you will add all those who share your sentiments, even though they are not on the spot.  Here all is uncertain; Euippius <a name="fr_2244"></a><a href="#fn_2244"><font size="1">2245</font></a>
  has arrived, but so far has made no sign.  However, he and those who think with him from the Armenian Tetrapolis and Cilicia are threatening a tumultuous meeting.</p>
