 </p><p class="c10"><a name="ii.LXXIX-p1"></a> <a name="ii.LXXIX-p1.1"></a><span class="c20"><a name="ii.LXXIX-p1.2"></a>Psalm LXXIX. <a name="fr_3666"></a><a href="#fn_3666"><font size="1">3667</font></a>
 </span></p>  
 <p class="c26"><a name="ii.LXXIX-p3"></a>1. Over the title of this Psalm, being so short and so simple, I think we need not tarry. But the prophecy which here we read sent before, we know to be evidently fulfilled. For when these things were being sung in the times of King David, nothing of such sort, by the hostility of the Gentiles, as yet had befallen the city Jerusalem, nor the Temple of God, which as yet was not even builded. For that after the death of David his son Salomon made a temple to God,  who is ignorant? That is spoken of therefore as though past, which in the Spirit was seen to be future.</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXXIX-p4"></a>“O God, the Gentiles have come into Thine inheritance” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#001">Psa. 79.1</a><a name="ii.LXXIX-p4.1"></a>). Under which form of expression other things which were to come to pass, are spoken of as having been done. Nor must this be wondered at, that these words are being spoken to God. For they are not being represented to Him not knowing, by whose revelation they are foreknown; but the soul is speaking with God with that affection of godliness, of which God knoweth. <a name="fr_3667"></a><a href="#fn_3667"><font size="1">3668</font></a>
  For even the things which Angels proclaim to men, they proclaim to them that know them not; but the things which they proclaim to God, they proclaim to Him knowing, when they offer our prayers, and in ineffable manner consult the eternal Truth respecting their actions, as an immutable law. And therefore this man of God is saying to God that which he is to learn of God, like a scholar to a master, not ignorant but judging; and so either approving what he hath taught, or  censuring what he hath not taught: especially because under the appearance of one praying, the Prophet is transforming into himself those who should be at the time when these things were to come to pass. <a name="fr_3668"></a><a href="#fn_3668"><font size="1">3669</font></a>
  But in praying it is customary to declare those things to God which He hath done in taking vengeance, and for a petition to be added, that henceforth He should pity and spare. In this way here also by him the judgments are spoken of by whom they are foretold, as if they were being spoken of by those whom they befell, and the very lamentation and prayer is a prophecy.</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXXIX-p7"></a>2. “They have defiled Thy holy Temple, they have made Jerusalem for a keeping of apples.” “They have made the dead bodies of Thy servants morsels for the fowls of heaven, the fleshes of Thy saints for the beasts of the earth” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#002">Psa. 79.2</a><a name="ii.LXXIX-p7.1"></a>). “They have poured forth their blood like water in the circuit of Jerusalem, and there was no one to bury them” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#003">Psa. 79.3</a><a name="ii.LXXIX-p7.2"></a>). If in this  prophecy any one of us shall have thought that there must be understood that laying waste of Jerusalem, which was made by Titus the Roman Emperor, when already the Lord Jesus Christ, after His Resurrection and <a name="page_381"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 381</font></a> <a name="ii.LXXIX-Page_381"></a>Ascension, was being preached among the Gentiles, it doth not occur to me how that people could now have been called the inheritance of God, as not holding to Christ, whom having rejected and slain, that people became reprobate, which not even after His Resurrection  would believe in Him, and even killed His Martyrs. For out of that people Israel whosoever have believed in Christ; to whom the offer of Christ was made, and in a manner the healthful and fruitful fulfilment of the promise; concerning whom even the Lord Himself saith, “I am not sent but to the sheep which have been lost of the house of Israel,” <a name="fr_3669"></a><a href="#fn_3669"><font size="1">3670</font></a>
  the same are they that out of them are the sons of promise; the same are counted for a seed; <a name="fr_3670"></a><a href="#fn_3670"><font size="1">3671</font></a>
  the same do belong to the inheritance of God. From hence are Joseph that just man, and the Virgin Mary who bore Christ: <a name="fr_3671"></a><a href="#fn_3671"><font size="1">3672</font></a>
  hence John Baptist the friend of the Bridegroom, and his parents Zacharias and Elisabeth: <a name="fr_3672"></a><a href="#fn_3672"><font size="1">3673</font></a>
  hence Symeon the old, <a name="fr_3673"></a><a href="#fn_3673"><font size="1">3674</font></a>
  and Anna the widow, who heard not Christ speaking by the sense of the body; but while yet an infant not speaking, by the Spirit perceived Him: hence the blessed Apostles: hence Nathanael, in whom guile was not: <a name="fr_3674"></a><a href="#fn_3674"><font size="1">3675</font></a>
  hence the other Joseph, who himself too looked for the kingdom of God: <a name="fr_3675"></a><a href="#fn_3675"><font size="1">3676</font></a>
  hence that so great multitude who went before and followed after His beast, saying, “Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord:” <a name="fr_3676"></a><a href="#fn_3676"><font size="1">3677</font></a>
  among whom was also that company of children, in whom He declared to have been fulfilled, “Out of the mouth of infants and sucklings Thou hast perfected praise.” <a name="fr_3677"></a><a href="#fn_3677"><font size="1">3678</font></a>
  Hence also were those after His resurrection, of whom on one day three and on another five thousand were baptized, <a name="fr_3678"></a><a href="#fn_3678"><font size="1">3679</font></a>
  welded into one soul and one heart by the fire of love; of whom no one spoke of anything as his own, but to them all things were common. <a name="fr_3679"></a><a href="#fn_3679"><font size="1">3680</font></a>
  Hence the holy deacons, of whom Stephen was crowned with martyrdom before the Apostles. <a name="fr_3680"></a><a href="#fn_3680"><font size="1">3681</font></a>
  Hence so many Churches of Judæa, which were in Christ, unto whom Paul was unknown by face, <a name="fr_3681"></a><a href="#fn_3681"><font size="1">3682</font></a>
  but known for an infamous ferocity, and more known for Christs most merciful grace. Hence even he, according to the prophecy sent before concerning him, “a wolf ravening, in the morning carrying off, and in the evening dividing morsels;” <a name="fr_3682"></a><a href="#fn_3682"><font size="1">3683</font></a>
  that is, first as persecutor carrying off unto death, afterwards as a preacher feeding unto life. These are they that are out of that people the inheritance of God.…So then even at this time a remnant through election of Grace have been saved. This remnant out of that nation doth belong to the inheritance <a name="fr_3683"></a><a href="#fn_3683"><font size="1">3684</font></a>
  of God: not those concerning whom a little below he saith, “But the rest have been blinded.” For thus he saith. “What then? That which Israel sought, this he hath not obtained: but the election hath obtained it: but the rest have been blinded.” <a name="fr_3684"></a><a href="#fn_3684"><font size="1">3685</font></a>
  This election then, this remnant, that people of God, which God hath not cast off, is called His inheritance. But in that Israel, which hath not obtained this, in the rest that were blinded, there was no longer an inheritance of God, in reference to whom it is possible that there should be spoken, after the glorification of Christ in the Heavens, in the time of Titus the Emperor, “O God, there have come the Gentiles unto Thine inheritance,” and the other things which  in this Psalm seem to have been foretold concerning the destruction of both the temple and city belonging to that people.</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXXIX-p24"></a>3. Furthermore herein we ought either to perceive those things which were done by other enemies, before Christ had come in the flesh: at that time when there were even the holy prophets, when the carrying away into Babylon took place, <a name="fr_3685"></a><a href="#fn_3685"><font size="1">3686</font></a>
  and that nation was grievously afflicted, and at the time when under Antiochus also the Maccabees, having endured horrible sufferings, were most gloriously crowned. <a name="fr_3686"></a><a href="#fn_3686"><font size="1">3687</font></a>
  Or certainly if after the Resurrection and Ascension of the Lord the inheritance of God must be understood to be here spoken of; such things must be understood herein, as at the hands of worshippers of idols, and enemies of the name of Christ, His Church, in such a multitude of martyrs, endured.…This Church then, this inheritance of God, out of circumcision and uncircumcision hath been congregated, that is, out of the people of Israel, and out of the rest of the nations,  by means of the Stone which the builders rejected, and which hath become for the Head of the corner, <a name="fr_3687"></a><a href="#fn_3687"><font size="1">3688</font></a>
  in which corner as it were two walls coming from different quarters were united. “For Himself is our peace, who hath made both one, that He might build two into Himself, making peace, and might unite together <a name="fr_3688"></a><a href="#fn_3688"><font size="1">3689</font></a>
  both in one Body unto God: <a name="fr_3689"></a><a href="#fn_3689"><font size="1">3690</font></a>
  in which Body we are sons of God, “crying, Abba Father.” <a name="fr_3690"></a><a href="#fn_3690"><font size="1">3691</font></a>
  Abba, on account of their language; Father, on account of ours. For Abba is the same as Father.…</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXXIX-p31"></a>4. But now in that which followeth, “they have made Jerusalem for a keeping of apples;” even the Church herself is rightly understood under this name, even the free Jerusalem our mother, <a name="fr_3691"></a><a href="#fn_3691"><font size="1">3692</font></a>
  concerning whom hath been written, “many more are the sons of the forsaken, than <a name="page_382"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 382</font></a> <a name="ii.LXXIX-Page_382"></a>of her that hath the husband.” <a name="fr_3692"></a><a href="#fn_3692"><font size="1">3693</font></a>
  The expression, “for a keeping of apples,” I think must be understood of the desertion which the wasting of persecution hath effected: that is, like a keeping of apples; for the keeping of apples is abandoned, when the apples have passed away. And certes when through the persecuting Gentiles the Church seemed to be forsaken, unto the celestial table, like as it were many and exceeding sweet apples from the garden of the Lord, the spirits of the martyrs did pass  away.</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXXIX-p34"></a>5. “They have made,” he saith, “the dead bodies of Thy servants morsels for the fowls of heaven, the fleshes of Thy saints for the beasts of the earth” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#002">Psa. 79.2</a><a name="ii.LXXIX-p34.1"></a>). The expression, “dead bodies,” hath been repeated in “fleshes:” and the expression, “of Thy servants,” hath been repeated in, “of Thy saints.” This only hath been varied, “to the fowls of heaven, and to the beasts of the earth.”  Better have they interpreted who have written “dead,” than as some have it, “mortal.” For “dead” is only said of those that have died; but mortal is a term applied even to living bodies. When then, as I have said, to their Husbandman the spirits of martyrs like apples had passed away, their dead bodies and their fleshes they set before the fowls of heaven and the beasts of the earth: as if any part of them could be lost to the resurrection, whereas out of the hidden recesses  of the natural world He will renew the whole, by whom even our hairs have been numbered. <a name="fr_3693"></a><a href="#fn_3693"><font size="1">3694</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXXIX-p36"></a>6. “They have poured forth their blood like water,” that is, abundantly and wantonly, “in the circuit of Jerusalem” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#003">Psa. 79.3</a><a name="ii.LXXIX-p36.1"></a>). If we herein understand the earthly city Jerusalem, we perceive the shedding of their blood in the circuit thereof, whom the enemy could find outside the walls. But if we understand it of that Jerusalem, concerning whom hath been said, “many more are the sons of her that was forsaken, than of her that hath the husband,” <a name="fr_3694"></a><a href="#fn_3694"><font size="1">3695</font></a>
  the circuit thereof is throughout the universal earth. For in that lesson of the Prophet, wherein is written, “many more are the sons of her that was forsaken, than of her that hath the husband:” a little after unto the same is said, “and He that hath delivered thee, shall be called the God of Israel of the universal earth.” <a name="fr_3695"></a><a href="#fn_3695"><font size="1">3696</font></a>
  The circuit then of this Jerusalem in this Psalm must be understood as followeth: so far as at that time the Church had been expanded, bearing fruit, and growing in the universal world, when in every part thereof persecution was raging, and was making havoc of the Martyrs, whose blood was being shed like water, to the great gain of the celestial treasuries. But as to that which hath been added, “and there was no one to bury:” it either ought not to seem to be an  incredible thing that there should have been so great a panic in some places, that not any buriers at all of holy bodies came forward: or certes that unburied corpses in many places might lie long time, until being by the religious in a manner stolen <a name="fr_3696"></a><a href="#fn_3696"><font size="1">3697</font></a>
  they were buried.</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXXIX-p40"></a>7. “We have become,” he saith, “a reproach to our neighbours” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#004">Psa. 79.4</a><a name="ii.LXXIX-p40.1"></a>). Therefore precious not in the sight of men, from whom this reproach was, but “precious <a name="fr_3697"></a><a href="#fn_3697"><font size="1">3698</font></a>
  in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints.” <a name="fr_3698"></a><a href="#fn_3698"><font size="1">3699</font></a>
  “A scoffing and derision:” or, as some have interpreted it, “a mockery to them that are in our circuit.” It is a repetition of the former sentence. For that which above hath been called, “a reproach,” the same hath been repeated in, “a scoffing and derision:” and that which above hath been said in, “to our neighbours,” the same hath been repeated in, “to them that are in our circuit.” Moreover, in reference to the earthly Jerusalem, the  neighbours, and those in the circuit of that nation, are certainly understood to be other nations. But in reference to the free Jerusalem our mother, <a name="fr_3699"></a><a href="#fn_3699"><font size="1">3700</font></a>
  there are neighbours even in the circuit of her, among whom, being her enemies, the Church dwelleth in the circuit of the round world.</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXXIX-p44"></a>8. In the second place now giving utterance to an evident prayer, whence it may be perceived that the calling to remembrance of former affliction is not by way of information but prayer; “How long,” he saith, “O Lord, wilt Thou be angry, unto the end? shall Thy jealousy burn like fire?” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#005">Psa. 79.5</a><a name="ii.LXXIX-p44.1"></a>). He is evidently asking God not to be angry unto the end, that is, that this so great oppression and tribulation and  devastation may not continue even unto the end; but that He moderate His chastening, according to that which is said in another Psalm, “Thou shalt feed us with the bread of tears, and Thou shalt give us to drink of tears in measure.” <a name="fr_3700"></a><a href="#fn_3700"><font size="1">3701</font></a>
  For the, “how long, O Lord, wilt Thou be angry, unto the end?” hath been spoken in the same sense as if it had been said, Be not, O Lord, angry unto the end. And in that which followeth, “shall Thy jealousy burn like fire?” both words must be understood, both, “how long,” and, “unto the end:” just as if there had been said, how long shall there burn like fire Thy jealousy unto the end? For these two words must be understood in the same manner as that  word which was used a little higher up, namely, “they have made.” For while the former sentence hath, “they have made the dead bodies of Thy servants morsels for the fowls of heaven:” <a name="fr_3701"></a><a href="#fn_3701"><font size="1">3702</font></a>
  this <a name="page_383"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 383</font></a> <a name="ii.LXXIX-Page_383"></a>word the latter sentence hath not, wherein is said, “the fleshes of Thy saints for the beasts of the earth;” but there is surely understood what the former hath, namely, “they have made.”</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXXIX-p47"></a>Moreover, the anger and jealousy of God <a name="fr_3702"></a><a href="#fn_3702"><font size="1">3703</font></a>
  are not emotions of God; as some do charge upon the Scriptures which they do not understand: <a name="fr_3703"></a><a href="#fn_3703"><font size="1">3704</font></a>
  but under the name of anger is to be understood the avenging of iniquity; under the name of jealousy, the exaction of chastity; that the soul may not despise the law of her Lord, and perish by departing in fornication from the Lord. These then in their actual operation in mens affliction are violent; but in the disposal of God they are calm, unto whom hath been said, “But Thou, O Lord of virtues, with calmness dost judge.” <a name="fr_3704"></a><a href="#fn_3704"><font size="1">3705</font></a>
  But it is clearly enough shown by these words, that for sins these tribulations do befall men, though they be faithful: although hence may bloom the Martyrs glory by occasion of their patience, and the yoke of discipline godly endured as the scourge of the Lord. Of this the Maccabees amid sharp tortures, <a name="fr_3705"></a><a href="#fn_3705"><font size="1">3706</font></a>
  of this the three men amid flames innocuous, <a name="fr_3706"></a><a href="#fn_3706"><font size="1">3707</font></a>
  of this the holy Prophets in captivity, do testify. For although paternal correction most bravely and most godly they endure, yet they do not hide the fact, that these things have befallen them for the deservings of their sins. <a name="fr_3707"></a><a href="#fn_3707"><font size="1">3708</font></a>
 …</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXXIX-p54"></a>9. But that which he addeth, “Pour forth Thine anger upon the nations which have not known Thee, and upon the kingdoms which have not called upon Thy name” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#006">Psa. 79.6</a><a name="ii.LXXIX-p54.1"></a>); this too is a prophecy, not a wish. Not in the imprecation of malevolence are these words spoken, but foreseen by the Spirit they are predicted: just as in the case of Judas the traitor, the evil things which were to befall him have been so prophesied  as if they were wished. For in like manner as the prophet doth not command Christ, though in the imperative mood he giveth utterance to what he saith, “Gird Thou Thy sword about Thy thigh, O Most Mighty: in Thy beauty and in Thy goodliness, both go on, and prosperously proceed, and reign:” <a name="fr_3708"></a><a href="#fn_3708"><font size="1">3709</font></a>
  so he doth not wish, but doth prophesy, who saith, “Pour forth Thine anger upon the nations which have not known Thee.” Which in his usual way he repeateth, saying, “And upon the kingdoms which have not called upon Thy name.” For nations have been repeated in kingdoms: and that they have not known Him, hath been repeated in this, that they have not called upon His name. How then must be understood, what the Lord saith in the Gospel   <a name="fr_3709"></a><a href="#fn_3709"><font size="1">3710</font></a>
  concerning stripes, “the many and the few”? if greater the anger of God is against the nations, which have not known the Lord? For in this which he saith, “Pour forth Thine anger,” with this word he hath clearly enough pointed out, how great anger he hath willed that there should be understood. Whence afterwards he saith, “Render to our neighbours seven times as much.” <a name="fr_3710"></a><a href="#fn_3710"><font size="1">3711</font></a>
  Is it not that there is a great difference between servants, who, though they know not the will of their Lord, do yet call upon His name, and those that are aliens from the family of so great a Master, who are so ignorant of God, as that they do not even call upon God? For in place of Him they call upon either idols or demons, or any creature they choose; not the Creator, who is blessed for ever. For those persons, concerning whom he is prophesying this, he doth not even  intimate to be so ignorant of the will of their God, as that still they fear the Lord Himself; but so ignorant of the Lord Himself, that they do not even call upon Him, and that they stand forth as enemies of His name. There is a great difference then between servants not knowing the will of their God, and yet living in His family and in His house, and enemies not only setting the will against knowing the Lord Himself, but also not calling upon His name, and even in His servants fighting  against it.</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXXIX-p58"></a>10. Lastly, there followeth, “For they have eaten up Jacob, and his place they have made desolate” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#007">Psa. 79.7</a><a name="ii.LXXIX-p58.1"></a>).…How we should view “the place” of Jacob, must be understood. For rather the place of Jacob may be supposed to be that city, wherein was also the Temple, whither-unto the whole of that nation for the purpose of sacrifice and worship, and to celebrate the Passover, the Lord had commanded to assemble. For  if the assemblies of Christians, letted and suppressed by persecutors, has been what the Prophet would have to be understood, it would seem that he should have said, places made desolate, not place. Still we may take the singular number as put for the plural number; as dress for clothes, soldiery for soldiers, cattle for beasts: for many words are usually spoken in this manner, and not only in the mouths of vulgar speakers, but even in the eloquence of the most approved authorities. Nor  to divine Scripture herself is this form of speech foreign. For even she hath put frog for frogs, locust for locusts, <a name="fr_3711"></a><a href="#fn_3711"><font size="1">3712</font></a>
  and countless expressions of the like kind. But that which hath been said, “They have eaten up Jacob,” the same is well understood, in that many men into their own evil-minded body, that is, into their own society, they have constrained to pass.</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXXIX-p60"></a>11. …He subjoineth, “Remember not our iniquities of old” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#008">Psa. 79.8</a><a name="ii.LXXIX-p60.1"></a>). He saith not by<a name="page_384"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 384</font></a> <a name="ii.LXXIX-Page_384"></a>gone, which might have even been recent; but “of old,” that is, coming from parents. For to such iniquities judgment, not correction, is <a name="fr_3712"></a><a href="#fn_3712"><font size="1">3713</font></a>
  owing. “Speedily let Thy mercies anticipate us.” Anticipate, that is, at Thy judgment. For “mercy exalteth above in judgment.” <a name="fr_3713"></a><a href="#fn_3713"><font size="1">3714</font></a>
  Now there is “judgment without mercy,” but to him that hath not showed mercy. But whereas he addeth, “for we have become exceeding poor:” unto this end he willeth that the mercies of God should be understood to anticipate us; that our own poverty, that is, weakness, by Him having mercy, should be aided to do His commandments, that we may not come to His judgment to be condemned.</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXXIX-p63"></a>12. Therefore there followeth, “Help us, O God, our healing <a name="fr_3714"></a><a href="#fn_3714"><font size="1">3715</font></a>
  One” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#009">Psa. 79.9</a><a name="ii.LXXIX-p64.1"></a>). By this word which he saith, “our healing One,” he doth sufficiently explain what sort of poverty he hath willed to be understood, in that which he had said, “for we have become exceeding poor.” For it is that very sickness, to which a healer is necessary. But while he would have us to be aided, he is neither ungrateful to grace, nor doth he take away free-will. For he that is aided, doth  also of himself something. He hath added also, “for the glory of Thy Name, O Lord, deliver us:” in order that he who glorieth, not in himself, but in the Lord may glory. <a name="fr_3715"></a><a href="#fn_3715"><font size="1">3716</font></a>
  “And merciful be Thou,” he saith, “to our sins for Thy Names sake:” not for our sake. For what else do our sins deserve, but due and condign punishments? But “merciful be Thou to our sins, for Thy Names sake.” Thus then Thou dost deliver us, that is, dost rescue us from evil things, while Thou dost both aid us to do justice, and art merciful to our sins, without which in this life we are not. For “in Thy sight shall no man living be  justified.”  <a name="fr_3716"></a><a href="#fn_3716"><font size="1">3717</font></a>
  But sin is iniquity. <a name="fr_3717"></a><a href="#fn_3717"><font size="1">3718</font></a>
  And “if Thou shalt have marked iniquities, who shall stand?” <a name="fr_3718"></a><a href="#fn_3718"><font size="1">3719</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXXIX-p69"></a>13. But that which he addeth, “lest at any time they should say among the Gentiles, Where is their God?” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#010">Psa. 79.10</a><a name="ii.LXXIX-p69.1"></a>) must be taken as rather for the Gentiles themselves. For to a bad end they come that have despaired of the true God, thinking that either He is not, or doth not help His own, and is not merciful to them. But this which followeth, “and that there may be known among the nations before our eyes the  vengeance of the blood of Thy servants which hath been shed:” is either to be understood as of the time, when they believe in the true God that used to persecute His inheritance; because even that is vengeance, whereby is slain the fierce iniquity of them by the sword of the Word of God, concerning which hath been said, “Gird Thou Thy sword:” <a name="fr_3719"></a><a href="#fn_3719"><font size="1">3720</font></a>
  or when obstinate enemies at the last are punished. For the corporal ills which they suffer in this world, they may have in common with good men. There is also another kind of vengeance; that wherein the Churchs enlargement and fruitfulness in this world after so great persecutions, wherein they supposed she would utterly perish, the sinner and unbeliever and enemy seeth, and is angry; “with his teeth he shall gnash, and shall pine away.”   <a name="fr_3720"></a><a href="#fn_3720"><font size="1">3721</font></a>
  For who would dare to deny that even this is a most heavy punishment? But I know not whether that which he saith, “before our eyes,” is taken with sufficient elegance, if by this sort of punishment we understand that which is done in the inmost recesses of the heart, and doth torment even those who blandly smile at us, while by us there cannot be seen what they suffer in the inner man. But the fact, that whether in them believing their iniquity is slain, or whether  the last punishment is rendered to them persevering in their naughtiness, without difficulty of doubtfulness is understood in the saying, “that there may be known before our eyes vengeance among the nations.”</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXXIX-p72"></a>14. And this indeed, as we have said, is a prophecy, not a wish.…And the Lord in the Gospel <a name="fr_3721"></a><a href="#fn_3721"><font size="1">3722</font></a>
  hath set before us the widow for an example, who longing to be avenged, did intercede with the unjust judge, who at length heard her, not as being guided by justice, but overcome with weariness: but this the Lord hath set before us, to show that much more the just God will speedily make the judgment of His elect, who cry unto Him day and night. Thence is also that cry of the Martyrs under the altar of God, <a name="fr_3722"></a><a href="#fn_3722"><font size="1">3723</font></a>
  that they may be avenged in the judgment of God. Where then is the, “Love your enemies, do good unto them that hate you, and pray for them that persecute you”? <a name="fr_3723"></a><a href="#fn_3723"><font size="1">3724</font></a>
  Where is also the, “Not rendering evil for evil, nor cursing for cursing:” <a name="fr_3724"></a><a href="#fn_3724"><font size="1">3725</font></a>
  and, “unto no man rendering evil for evil”? <a name="fr_3725"></a><a href="#fn_3725"><font size="1">3726</font></a>
 …For when the Lord was exhorting us to love enemies, He set before us the example of our Father, who is in Heaven, “who maketh His sun to rise upon good men and evil men, and raineth upon just men and unjust men:” <a name="fr_3726"></a><a href="#fn_3726"><font size="1">3727</font></a>
  doth He yet therefore not chasten even by temporal correction, or not condemn at the last the obstinately hardened? Let therefore an enemy be so loved as that the Lords justice whereby he is punished displease us not, and let the justice whereby he is punished so please us, as that the joy is not at his evil but at the good Judge. But a malevolent soul is sorrowful, if his enemy by being corrected shall have escaped punishment: and <a name="page_385"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 385</font></a> <a name="ii.LXXIX-Page_385"></a>when he  seeth him punished, he is so glad that he is avenged, that he is not delighted with the justice of God, whom he loveth not, but with the misery of that man whom he hateth: and when he leaveth judgment to God, he hopeth that God will hurt more than he could hurt: and when he giveth food to his hungering enemy, and drink to him thirsty, he hath an evil-minded sense of that which is written, “For thus doing thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head.” <a name="fr_3727"></a><a href="#fn_3727"><font size="1">3728</font></a>
 …In such sort then under the appearance of one asking in this Psalm, future vengeance on the ungodly is prophesied of, as that we are to understand that holy men of God have loved their enemies, and have wished no one anything but good, which is godliness in this world, everlasting life in that to come; but in the punishments of evil men, they have taken pleasure not in the ills of them, but in Gods good judgments; and wheresoever in the holy Scriptures we read of their  hatreds against men, they were the hatreds of vices, which every man must needs hate in himself, if he loveth himself.</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXXIX-p80"></a>15. But now in that which followeth, “Let there come in before Thy sight,” or, as some copies have it, “In Thy sight, the groans of the fettered:” not easily doth any one discover that the Saints were thrown into fetters by persecutors; and if this doth happen amid so great and manifold a variety of punishments, so rarely it doth happen, that it must not be believed that the prophet had chosen to allude to this especially in this verse. But, in fact,  the fetters are the infirmity and the corruptibleness of the body, which do weigh down the soul. For by means of the frailty thereof, as a kind of material for certain pains and troubles, the persecutor might constrain her unto ungodliness. From these fetters the Apostle was longing to be unbound, and to be with Christ; <a name="fr_3728"></a><a href="#fn_3728"><font size="1">3729</font></a>
  but to abide in the flesh was necessary for their sakes unto whom he was ministering the Gospel. Until then this corruptible put on incorruption, and this mortal put on immortality, <a name="fr_3729"></a><a href="#fn_3729"><font size="1">3730</font></a>
  like as it were with fetters, the weak flesh doth let the willing spirit. <a name="fr_3730"></a><a href="#fn_3730"><font size="1">3731</font></a>
  These fetters then not any do feel, but they that in themselves do groan being burthened, desiring to be clothed upon with the tabernacle which is from Heaven; <a name="fr_3731"></a><a href="#fn_3731"><font size="1">3732</font></a>
  because both death is a terror, and mortal life is sorrow. In behalf of these men groaning the Prophet doth redouble his groaning, that their groaning may “come in in the sight of the Lord.” They also may be understood to be fettered, who are enchained with the precepts of wisdom, the which being patiently supported are turned into ornaments: whence it hath been written, “Put thy feet into her fetters.” <a name="fr_3732"></a><a href="#fn_3732"><font size="1">3733</font></a>
  “According to the greatness,” he saith, “of Thy arm, receive Thou unto adoption the sons of them that are put to death:” <a name="fr_3733"></a><a href="#fn_3733"><font size="1">3734</font></a>
  or, as is read in some copies, “Possess Thou sons by the death of the punished.” <a name="fr_3734"></a><a href="#fn_3734"><font size="1">3735</font></a>
  Wherein the Scripture seemeth to me to have sufficiently shown, what hath been the groan of the fettered, who for the name of Christ endured most grievous persecutions, which in this Psalm are most clearly prophesied. For being beset with divers sufferings, they used to pray for the Church, that their blood might not be without fruit to posterity; in order that the Lords harvest might more abundantly flourish by the very means whereby enemies thought that she would  perish. For “sons of them that were put to death” he hath called them who were not only not terrified by the sufferings of those that went before, but in Him for whose name they knew them to have suffered, being inflamed with their glory which did inspire them to the like, in most ample hosts they believed. Therefore he hath said, “According to the greatness of Thine arm.” For so great a wonder followed in the case of Christian peoples, as they, who thought they would prevail  aught by persecuting her, no wise believed would follow.</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXXIX-p88"></a>16. “Render,” he saith, “to our neighbours seven times so much into their bosoms” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#013">Psa. 79.13</a><a name="ii.LXXIX-p88.1"></a>). Not any evil things he is wishing, but things just he is foretelling and prophesying as to come. But in the number seven, that is, in sevenfold retribution, he would have the completeness of the punishment to be perceived, for with this number fulness is wont to be signified. Whence also there is this saying for the  good, “He shall receive in this world seven times as much:” <a name="fr_3735"></a><a href="#fn_3735"><font size="1">3736</font></a>
  which hath been put for all. “As if having nothing, and possessing all things.” <a name="fr_3736"></a><a href="#fn_3736"><font size="1">3737</font></a>
  Of neighbours he is speaking, because amongst them dwelleth the Church even unto the day of severing: for not now is made the corporal separation. “Into their bosoms,” he saith, as being now in secret, so that the vengeance which is now being executed in secret in this life, hereafter may be known among the nations before our eyes. For when a man is given over to a reprobate mind, in his inward bosom he is receiving what he deserveth of future punishments.  “Their reproach wherewith they have reproached Thee, O Lord.” This do Thou render to them sevenfold into their bosoms, that is, in return for this reproach, most fully do Thou rebuke them in their secret places. For in this they have reproached Thy Name, thinking to efface Thee from the earth in Thy servants.</p>  
 <p><a name="ii.LXXIX-p91"></a><a name="page_386"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 386</font></a> <a name="ii.LXXIX-Page_386"></a>17. “But we Thy people” (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#014">Psa. 79.14</a><a name="ii.LXXIX-p91.1"></a>), must be taken generally of all the race of godly and true Christians. “We,” then, whom they thought they had power to destroy, “Thy people, and the sheep of thy flock:” in order that he that glorieth may glory in the Lord, <a name="fr_3737"></a><a href="#fn_3737"><font size="1">3738</font></a>
  “will confess to Thee for an age.” But some copies have it, “will confess to Thee for everlasting.” Out of a Greek ambiguity this diversity hath arisen. For that which the Greek hath, <span class="Greek"><a name="ii.LXXIX-p92.2"></a>εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα</span>, may be interpreted both by “for everlasting,” and “for an age;” but according to the context we must understand which is the better interpretation. The sense then of this passage seemeth to me to show,  that we ought to say “for an age,” that is, even unto the end of time. But the following verse after the manner of the Scriptures, and especially of the Psalms, is a repetition of the former with the order changed, putting that before which in the former case was after, and that after which in the former case was before. For whereas in the former case there had been said, “we will confess to Thee,” instead of the same herein hath been said, “We will proclaim Thy praise.” And  so whereas in the former case there had been said, “for an age,” instead of the same herein hath been said, “for generation and generation.” For this repetition of generation doth signify perpetuity: or, as some understand it, it is because there are two generations, an old and a new.…But in many places of holy Scriptures we have already made known to you that confession is also put for praise: as in this passage it is, “These words ye shall say in confession, That the  works of the Lord are very good.”  <a name="fr_3738"></a><a href="#fn_3738"><font size="1">3739</font></a>
  And especially that which the Saviour Himself saith, who had not any sin at all, which by repentance to confess: “I confess to Thee, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes.” <a name="fr_3739"></a><a href="#fn_3739"><font size="1">3740</font></a>
  I have said this, in order that it may be more clearly perceived how in the expression, “We will proclaim Thy praise,” the same hath been repeated as had been said higher up, “We will confess to Thee.”</p>
