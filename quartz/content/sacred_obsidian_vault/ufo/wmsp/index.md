 <p>This is a UFO contactee account by two
 sisters from the Midwest US in the late 1950s.
 The Mitchell sisters, Helen and Betty,
 are approached by space aliens, who can pass for human beings,
 in (of all places) a coffee shop in St. Louis, Missouri.
 On a second encounter (again in the coffee shop)
 they are given a schematic for a communicator,
 which they build, and through it they receive messages
 from the Space People from Mars and Venus.
 Unlike the more aggressive aliens of later decades,
 they wait until the third date to take Helen 
 on a ride to the mothership.
 There she learns that the aliens have
 one-piece uniforms that 'feel like satin,'
 speak a Universal Language, and play a game like shuffleboard when off-duty.
 </p>
 <p>
 After Helen returns, the Space People transmit an urgent message
 that nuclear weapons testing must be ended, otherwise
 our civilization will go the way of Atlantis.
 One thinks that they would have mentioned this earlier when she
 was on the mothership.
 And why deliver this rather important message 
 to the Mitchell sisters of Saint Louis, Missouri?
 Why not the United Nations or President Eisenhower?
 Other ideas that the Space Brothers tell the sisters to spread
 are vegetarianism and the need for educational TV.
 Nuclear test ban? Educational TV?
 Apparently the Space People are (gasp) <i>liberals</i>.
 </p>
 <p>
 This yarn was apparently good enough for the Mitchell sisters
 to make the rounds of the UFO conventions, although
 nowadays it would make all but the most gullible
 enthusiast laugh out loud.
 Nonetheless, the naive charm of this little relic of a simpler time
 makes it an irresistible read.
