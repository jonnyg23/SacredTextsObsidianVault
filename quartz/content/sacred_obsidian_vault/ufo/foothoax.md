 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 BIGFOOT HOAX GIVING SANTILLI "ALIEN AUTOPSY" A GOOD RUN FOR THE "FILM HOAX
 AWARD."
 
 By Rob McConnell,
 Publisher,
 THE 'X' CHRONICLES.
 
 St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada.
 
 Wednesday, May 15, 1996.
 
 The infamous BigFoot photograph/film by Roger Patterson which was allegedly
 filmed in 1967 has been uncovered as a hoax.
 
 Harry Kemball, Director and Screenwriter at Golden Eagle Productions told
 THE 'X' CHRONICLES researchers that he was at the CanWest 16mm Film Editing
 Room in 1967 when Roger Patterson and his friends put together his BigFoot
 Hoax on 16mm film.
 
 According to Kemball thay all laughed and joked about the rental of the
 Gorilla Costume and the construction of the Big Feets.
 
 One of Kemballs' extra tall buddies played the role of BigFoot.
 
 Patterson and his crew carefully chose muddy ground so that the foot prints
 would expand.
 
 The film crew carefully shot it on 16mm Kodak EF High Speed Color Positive
 film stock and when the film is force processed in "Hot Soup" - the film
 grain is enlarged to add to the sense of mystery.
 
 They added a shaky camera zoom with the right amount of "out of focus" to
 complete the deception.
 
 Kemball, who is a graduate in comparative anatomy studies states, "this
 creature does not and never has existed."
 
 The 'X' Chronicles is in possession of a signed statement by Kemball to the
 statements contained in this release.
 
 A pcx photo is available upon request.
