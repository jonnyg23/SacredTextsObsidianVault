 <h1 align="CENTER">APPENDIX VII</h1>
 <p>Treatise on the Hexagrams taken promiscuously, according to the opposition or diversity of their meaning.</p>
 <p>This last of the Appendixes is touched on very briefly in the concluding paragraph of the Introduction, <a href="icintr03.htm#page_55">p. 55</a>. It is stated there to be in rhyme, and I have endeavoured to give a similar form to the following version of it. The rhymes and length of the lines in the original, however, are very irregular, and I found it impossible to reproduce that irregularity in English.</p>
 <p>1, 2. Strength in <i>Kh</i>ien, weakness in Khwăn we find.</p>
 <p>8, 7. Pî shows us joy, and Sze the anxious mind.</p>
 <p>19, 20. Lin gives, Kwân seeks;--such are the several themes</p>
 <p>Their different figures were to teach designed.</p>
 <p>3. <i>K</i>un manifests itself, yet keeps its place;</p>
 <p>4. 'Mid darkness still, to light Măng sets its face.</p>
 <p>51, 52. <i>K</i>ăn starts; Kăn stops. In Sun and Yî are seen</p>
 <p>41, 42. How fulness and decay their course begin.</p>
 <p>26. Tâ <i>Kh</i>û keeps still, and waits the proper time.</p>
 <p>25. Wû Wang sets forth how evil springs from crime.</p>
 <p><a name="page_442"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 442</font></a></p>
 <p>45, 46. Good men in Žhui collect; in Shang they rise:</p>
 <p>15, 16. <i>Kh</i>ien itself, Yü others doth despise.</p>
 <p>21, 22. Shih Ho takes eating for its theme; and Pî</p>
 <p>Takes what is plain, from ornament quite free.</p>
 <p>58, 57. Tui shows its scope, but Sun's we do not see.</p>
 <p>17, 18. Sui quits the old; Kû makes a new decree.</p>
 <p>23. We see in Po its subject worn away;</p>
 <p>24. And Fû shows its recovering from decay.</p>
 <p>35. Above in Žin the sun shines clear and bright;</p>
 <p>36. But in Ming Î 'tis hidden from the sight.</p>
 <p>48,47. Progress in Žing in Khwăn encounters blight.</p>
 <p>31. Effect quick answering cause in Hsien appears;</p>
 <p>32. While Hăng denotes continuance for years.</p>
 <p>59,60. Hwân scatters; but Žieh its code of rules uprears.</p>
 <p>40. Relief and ease with <i>K</i>ieh are sure to come;</p>
 <p>41. Hard toil and danger have in <i>K</i>ien their home.</p>
 <p>38. Khwei looks on others as beyond its care;</p>
 <p>37. Kiâ <i>Z</i>ăn all includes within its sphere.</p>
 <p><a name="page_443"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 443</font></a></p>
 <p>12, 11. While Phî and Thâi their different scopes prefer,</p>
 <p>34, 33. Tâ <i>K</i>wang stops here as right; withdraws Thun there.</p>
 <p>14. Tâ Yû adhering multitudes can show;</p>
 <p>13. Thung <i>Z</i>ăn reflects their warm affection's glow.</p>
 <p>50, 51. Ting takes what's new; the old is left by Ko.</p>
 <p>61, 62. Sincere is <i>K</i>ung Fû; but exceeds, Hsiâo Kwo.</p>
 <p>55, 56. Făng tells of trouble; Lü can boast few friends.</p>
 <p>30, 29. Fire mounts in Lî; water in Khân descends.</p>
 <p>9. Hsiâo <i>Kh</i>û with few 'gainst many foes contends.</p>
 <p>10. Movement in Lî, unresting, never ends.</p>
 <p>5. Hsü shows its subject making no advance:</p>
 <p>6. In Sung we seek in vain a friendly glance;</p>
 <p>28. And Tâ Kwo's overthrown with sad mischance.</p>
 <p>44. Kâu shows a meeting, where the many strong</p>
 <p>Are met by one that's weak, yet struggles long.</p>
 <p>53. In <i>K</i>ien we see a bride who will delay</p>
 <p>To move until the bridegroom takes his way.</p>
 <p>27. Body and mind are nourished right in Î;</p>
 <p>63. All things are well established in Kî Žî.</p>
 <p><a name="page_444"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 444</font></a></p>
 <p>54. Kwei Mei reveals how ends the virgin life;</p>
 <p>64. Wei Žî how fails the youth (to get a wife).</p>
 <p>43. The strong disperse the weak; Kwâi teaches so.</p>
 <p>Prospers the good man's way; to grief all small men go.</p>
