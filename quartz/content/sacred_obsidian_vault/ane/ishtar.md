 DESCENT OF THE GODDESS ISHTAR INTO THE LOWER WORLD<br>
 [From The Civilization of Babylonia and Assyria, M. Jastrow, 1915]<br>
 </h3></center>
 <br>
 To the land of no return, the land of darkness,<br>
 Ishtar, the daughter of Sin directed her thought,<br>
 Directed her thought, Ishtar, the daughter of Sin,<br>
 To the house of shadows, the dwelling, of Irkalla,<br>
 To the house without exit for him who enters therein,<br>
 To the road, whence there is no turning,<br>
 To the house without light for him who enters therein,<br>
 The place where dust is their nourishment, clay their food.'<br>
 They have no light, in darkness they dwell.<br>
 Clothed like birds, with wings as garments,<br>
 Over door and bolt, dust has gathered.<br>
 Ishtar on arriving at the gate of the land of no return,<br>
 To the gatekeeper thus addressed herself:<br>
 <br>
 "Gatekeeper, ho, open thy gate!<br>
 Open thy gate that I may enter!<br>
 If thou openest not the gate to let me enter,<br>
 I will break the door, I will wrench the lock,<br>
 I will smash the door-posts, I will force the doors.<br>
 I will bring up the dead to eat the living.<br>
 And the dead will outnumber the living."<br>
 The gatekeeper opened his mouth and spoke,<br>
 Spoke to the lady Ishtar:<br>
 "Desist, O lady, do not destroy it.<br>
 I will go and announce thy name to my queen Ereshkigal."<br>
 The gatekeeper entered and spoke to Ereshkigal:<br>
 "Ho! here is thy sister, Ishtar ...<br>
 Hostility of the great powers ...<br>
 When Ereshkigal heard this,<br>
 As when one hews down a tamarisk she trembled,<br>
 As when one cuts a reed, she shook:<br>
 "What has moved her heart [seat of the intellect] what has stirred her liver [seat of the emotions]?<br>
 Ho there, does this one wish to dwell with me?<br>
 To eat clay as food, to drink dust as wine?<br>
 I weep for the men who have left their wives.<br>
 I weep for the wives torn from the embrace of their husbands;<br>
 For the little ones cut off before their time.<br>
 Go, gatekeeper, open thy gate for her,<br>
 Deal with her according to the ancient decree."<br>
 The gatekeeper went and opened his gate to her:<br>
 Enter, O lady, let Cuthah greet thee.<br>
 <br>
 Let the palace of the land of no return rejoice at thy presence!<br>
 <br>
 He bade her enter the first gate, which he opened wide, and took the large crown off her head:<br>
 "Why, O gatekeeper, dost thou remove the large crown off my head?"<br>
 "Enter, O lady, such are the decrees of Ereshkigal."<br>
 The second gate he bade her enter, opening it wide, and removed her earrings:<br>
 "Why, O gatekeeper, dost thou remove my earrings?"<br>
 "Enter, O lady, for such are the decrees of Ereshkigal."<br>
 The third gate he bade her enter, opened it wide, and removed her necklace:<br>
 "Why, O gatekeeper, dost thou remove my necklace? "<br>
 "Enter, O lady, for such are the decrees of Ereshkigal."<br>
 The fourth gate he bade her enter, opened it wide, and removed the ornaments of her breast:<br>
 "Why, O gatekeeper, dost thou remove the ornaments of my breast?  "<br>
 "Enter, O lady, for such are the decrees of Ereshkigal."<br>
 The fifth gate he bade her enter, opened it wide, and removed the girdle of her body studded with birthstones.<br>
 "Why, O gatekeeper, dost thou remove the girdle of my body, studded with birth-stones?"<br>
 "Enter, O lady, for such are the decrees of Ereshkigal."<br>
 The sixth gate, he bade her enter, opened it wide, and removed the spangles off her hands and feet.<br>
 "Why, O gatekeeper, dost thou remove the spangles off my hands and feet?"<br>
 "Enter, O lady, for thus are the decrees of Ereiihkigal."<br>
 The seventh gate he bade her enter, opened it wide, and removed her loin-cloth.<br>
 "Why, O gatekeeper, dost thou remove my loin-cloth ?"<br>
 "Enter, O lady, for such are the decrees of Ereshkigal."<br>
 Now when Ishtar had gone down into the land of no return,<br>
 Ereshkigal saw her and was angered at her presence.<br>
 Ishtar, without reflection, threw herself at her [in a rage].<br>
 Ereshkigal opened her mouth and spoke,<br>
 To Namtar, her messenger, she addressed herself:<br>
 "Go Namtar, imprison her in my palace.<br>
 Send against her sixty disease, to punish Ishtar.<br>
 Eye-disease against her eyes,<br>
 Disease of the side against her side,<br>
 Foot-disease against her foot,<br>
 Heart-disease against her heart,<br>
 Head-disease against her head,<br>
 Against her whole being, against her entire body."<br>
 After the lady Ishtar had gone down into the land of no return,<br>
 The bull did not mount the cow, the ass approached not the she-ass,<br>
 To the maid in the street, no man drew near<br>
 The man slept in his apartment,<br>
 The maid slept by herself.<br>
 <br>
 [The second half of the poem, the reverse of the tablet, continues is follows:]<br>
 <br>
 The countenance of Papsukal, the messenger of the great gods, fell, his face was troubled.<br>
 In mourning garb he was clothed, in soiled garments clad.<br>
 Shamash [the sun-god] went to Sin [the moon-god], his father, weeping,<br>
 In the presence of Ea, the King, he went with flowing tears.<br>
 "Ishtar has descended into the earth and has not come up.  The bull does not mount the cow, the ass does not approach the she-ass.<br>
 The man does not approach the maid in the street,<br>
 The man sleeps in his apartment,<br>
 The maid sleeps by herself."<br>
 Ea, in the wisdom of his heart, formed a being,<br>
 He formed Asu-shu-namir the eunuch.<br>
 Go, Asu-shu-namir, to the land of no return direct thy face!<br>
 The seven gates of the land without return be opened before thee,<br>
 May Eresbkigal at sight of thee rejoice!<br>
 After her heart has been assuaged, her liver quieted,<br>
 Invoke against her the name of the great gods,<br>
 Raise thy head    direct thy attention to the khalziku skin.<br>
 "Come, lady, let them give me the khalziku skin, that I may drink water out of it."<br>
 When Ereshkigal heard this, she struck her side, bit her finger,<br>
 Thou hast expressed a wish that can not be granted.<br>
 Go, Asu-sbu-iaamir, I curse thee with a great curse,<br>
 The sweepings of the gutters of the city be thy food,<br>
 The drains of the city be thy drink,<br>
 The shadow of the wall be thy abode,<br>
 The thresholds be thy dwelling-place;<br>
 Drunkard and sot strike thy cheek!"<br>
 Ereshkigal opened her mouth and spoke,<br>
 To Namtar, her messenger, she addressed herself.<br>
 "Go, Namtar, knock at the strong palace,<br>
 Strike the threshold of precious stones,<br>
 Bring out the Anunnaki, seat them on golden thrones.<br>
 Sprinkle Ishtar with the waters of life and take her out of my presence.<br>
 Namtar went, knocked at the strong palace,<br>
 Tapped on the threshold of precious stones.<br>
 He brought out the Anunnaki and placed them on golden thrones,<br>
 He sprinkled Ishtar with the waters of life and took hold of her.<br>
 Through the first gate he led her out and returned to her her loin-cloth.<br>
 Through the second gate he led her out and returned to her the spangles of her hands and feet<br>
 Through the third gate he led her out and returned to her the girdle of her body, studded with birth-stones.<br>
 Through the fourth gate he led her out and returned to her the ornaments of her breast.<br>
 Through the fifth gate he led her out and returned to her her necklace.<br>
 Through the sixth gate he led her out and returned her earrings.<br>
 Through the seventh gate he led her out and returned to her the large crown for her head.<br>
 <br>
 [The following lines are in the form of an address -apparently to some one who has sought release for a dear one from the portals of the lower world.]<br>
 <br>
 "If she (Ishtar) will not grant thee her release,<br>
 To Tammuz, the lover of her youth,<br>
 Pour out pure waters, pour out fine oil;<br>
 With a festival garment deck him that he may play on the flute of lapis lazuli,<br>
 That the votaries may cheer his liver. [his spirit]<br>
 Belili [sister of Tammuz] had gathered the treasure,<br>
 With precious stones filled her bosom.<br>
 When Belili heard the lament of her brother, she dropped her treasure,<br>
 She scattered the precious stones before her,<br>
 "Oh, my only brother, do not let me perish!<br>
 On the day when Tammuz plays for me on the flute of lapis lazuli, playing it for me with the porphyry ring.<br>
 Together with him, play ye for me, ye weepers and lamenting women!<br>
 That the dead may rise up and inhale the incense."<br>
