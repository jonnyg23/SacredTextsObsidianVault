 <p><a name="fn_137"></a><a href="eog13.htm#fr_150">54:1</a> A difficult passage, capable of other interpretations. But if this is the correct one, Uta-Napishtim is mocking the "strong man" who seeks eternal life, with the tally of the number of hours (or days?) he sleeps, unable even to stay awake.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_138"></a><a href="eog13.htm#fr_151">54:2</a> As before "Unto him, unto Uta-Napishtim."</p>
