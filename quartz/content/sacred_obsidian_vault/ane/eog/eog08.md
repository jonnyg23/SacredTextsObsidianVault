 <p><a name="fn_78"></a><a href="eog08.htm#fr_86">33:3</a> The Roller, a brightly coloured bird which lives in the palm groves of Southern Babylonia, uttering a hoarse cry which may be identified with <i>kappi</i>. During the breeding season it has a curious irregular flight which probably gave rise to the legend of the broken wing.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_79"></a><a href="eog08.htm#fr_87">33:4</a> The force of the tense of the last verb appears to demand this form of translation.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_80"></a><a href="eog08.htm#fr_88">33:5</a> This, the invitation of Ishtar, (two words) is omitted.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_81"></a><a href="eog08.htm#fr_89">34:1</a> The reply of Ishullanu is difficult. when the goddess falls in love with him, he refuses, saying in contempt that his mother's baking is enough for him, and, as for the cold, the reeds provide him with ample covering.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_87"></a><a href="eog08.htm#fr_95">34:7</a> It is usual to restore this passage from the Legend of the descent of Ishtar to Hades where she, outside the door, threatens to break it down and release the ghosts, who shall then be more numerous than the living. The incident of the creation of the Bull is found on a Semitic fragment from Boghaz Keui (<i>Keils. Boghazk</i>. iv. 12, <i>p</i>. 12): the Bull is to be a young steer of six months, but there is little else that is new. This is the other part of the tablet quoted in the note to the Sixth Tablet, <i>l</i>. 20.</p>
