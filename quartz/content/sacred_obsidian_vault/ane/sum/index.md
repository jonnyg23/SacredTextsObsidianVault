 <p>The Sumerians were a non-Semitic, non-Indo-European people who 
 lived in southern Babylonia from 4000-3000 B.C.E. They invented
 cunieform writing, and their spiritual beliefs influenced
 all successive Near Eastern religions, including Judaism,
 Christianity and Islam.
 They produced an extensive body of literature, among the oldest in the
 world.
 Samuel Noah Kramer spent most of his life studying this literature,
 by piecing together clay tablets in far-flung museums.
 This short work gives translations or summaries of the most important
 Sumerian myths.
