 <h3 align="CENTER">MUA'S ANSWER</h3>
 <p>Sweet Mua lifts her eyes toward the heights<br>
 That glow afar beneath the softened lights<br>
 That rest upon the mountain's crystalline.<br>
 And see! they change their hues incarnadine<br>
 To gold, and emerald, and opaline;<br>
 Swift changing to a softened festucine<br>
 Before the eye. And thus they change their hues<br>
 To please the sight of every soul that views<br>
 Them in that Land; but she heeds not the skies,<br>
 Or glorious splendor of her home; her eves<br>
 Have that far look of spirits viewing men<br>
 On earth, from the invisible mane,<br>
 That erstwhile rests upon the mortal eye,--<br>
 A longing for that home beyond the sky;</p>
 <p><a name="page_155"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 155</font></a></p>
 <p>A yearning for that bliss that love imparts,<br>
 Where pain and sorrow reach no mortal hearts.</p>
 <p>A light now breaks across her beauteous face;<br>
 She, turning, says to him with Heavenly grace:</p>
 <p>"Dear Izdubar, thou knowest how I love<br>
 Thee, how my heart my love doth daily prove;<br>
 And, oh, I cannot let thee go alone.<br>
 I know not what awaits each soul there gone.<br>
 Our spirits often leave this glorious land,<br>
 Invisible return on earth, and stand<br>
 Amidst its flowerets, 'neath its glorious skies.<br>
 Thou knowest every spirit here oft flies<br>
 From earth, but none its secrets to us tell,<br>
 Lest some dark sorrow might here work its spell.<br>
 And, oh, I could not see dark suffering, woe<br>
 There spread, with power none to stop its flow!</p>
 <p>I saw thee coming to us struck with fire,<br>
 Oh, how to aid thee did my heart desire!<br>
 Our tablets tell us how dread sorrow spreads<br>
 Upon that world and mars its glowing meads.<br>
 But, oh, so happy am I, here to know<br>
 That they with us here end all sorrow, woe.<br>
 O precious Izdubar! its sights would strike<br>
 Me there with sadness, and my heart would break!<br>
 And yet I learn that it is glorious, sweet!<br>
 To there enjoy its happiness,--so fleet<br>
 It speeds to sorrowing hearts to turn their tears<br>
 To joy! How sweet to them when it appears,<br>
 And sends a gleam of Heaven through their lives!</p>
 <p>No! no! dear heart! I cannot go! It grieves<br>
 Thee! come, my dear one! quick to us return;<br>
 We here again will pair our love, and learn<br>
 How sweet it is to meet with joy again;<br>
 How happy will sweet love come to us then!"</p>
 <p>She rests her head upon his breast, and lifts<br>
 Her face for Love's sweet kiss, and from them drifts<font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> </p>
 <p><a name="page_156"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 156</font></a></p>
 <p>A halo o'er the shining gesdin-trees<br>
 And spreads around them Heaven's holy rays.<br>
 He <a href="errata.htm#1">kisses</a> her sweet lips, and brow, and eyes,<br>
 Then turns his gaze toward the glowing skies:</p>
 <p>"I bless thee, for thy sweetest spirit here!<br>
 I bless this glorious land, that brings me near<br>
 To one that wafts sweet Heaven in my heart;<br>
 From thy dear plains how can my soul depart?<br>
 O Mua, Mua! how my heart now sings!<br>
 Thy love is sweeter than all earthly things!<br>
 I would I were not crowned a king!--away<br>
 From this bright land--here would I ever stay!<br>
 As thou hast said, I soon will here return;<br>
 The earth cannot withhold me from this bourne,<br>
 And soon my time allotted there will end,<br>
 And hitherward how happy I will wend!"</p>
 <p>"And when thou goest, how my love shall there<br>
 Guard thee, and keep thy heart with Mua here.<br>
 Another kiss!"<br>
                   Her form doth disappear<br>
 Within the garden, gliding through the air.<br>
 He seats himself upon a couch and rests<br>
 His head upon his hand, and thought invests<br>
 Him round. His memory returns again<br>
 To Erech's throne, and all the haunts of men.<br>
 He rises, turns his footsteps to the halls,<br>
 And thoughtful disappears within its walls.</p>
