 <h3 align="CENTER">IZDUBAR ENTERS HADES--THE SONG OF THE DALKHI IN THE CAVERN OF HORRORS--THE KING PASSES THROUGH HADES TO THE GARDEN OF THE GODS, AND SEES THE WONDERFUL FOUNTAIN OF LIFE'S WATERS</h3>
 <p>In a weird passage to the Under-World,<br>
 Where demon shades sit with their pinions furled<br>
 Along the cavern's walls with poisonous breath,<br>
 In rows here mark the labyrinths of Death.<br>
 The King with torch upraised, the pathway finds,<br>
 Along the way of mortal souls he winds,<br>
 Where shades sepulchral, soundless rise amid<br>
 Dark gulfs that yawn, and in the blackness hide<br>
 Their depths beneath the waves of gloomy lakes<br>
 And streams that sleep beneath the sulphurous flakes<br>
 That drift o'er waters bottomless, and chasms;<br>
 Where moveless depths receive Life's dying spasms.</p>
 <p><a name="page_127"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 127</font></a></p>
 <p>Here Silence sits supreme on a drear throne<br>
 Of ebon hue, and joyless reigns alone<br>
 O'er a wide waste of blackness,--solitude<br>
 Black, at her feet, there sleeps the awful flood<br>
 Of mystery which grasps all mortal souls,<br>
 Where grisly horrors sit with crests of ghouls,<br>
 And hateless welcome with their eyes of fire<br>
 Each soul;--remorseless lead to terrors dire;<br>
 And ever, ever crown the god of Fate;<br>
 And there, upon her ebon throne she sate<br>
 The awful fiend, dark goddess Mam-mitu,<br>
 Who reigns through all these realms of La-Atzu. <a name="fr_257"></a><a href="#fn_254"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>
 <p>But hark! what are these sounds within the gloom?<br>
 And see! long lines of torches nearer come!<br>
 And now within a recess they have gone;<br>
 The King must pass their door! perhaps some one<br>
 Of them may see him! turn the hags of gloom<br>
 Upon him, as he goes by yonder room!<br>
 He nearer comes, and peers within; and see!<br>
 A greenish glare fills all the cave! and he<br>
 Beholds a blaze beneath a cauldron there;<br>
 Coiled, yonder lie the Dragons of Despair;<br>
 And lo! from every recess springs a form<br>
 Of shapeless horror! now with dread alarm<br>
 He sees the flitting forms wild whirling there,<br>
 And awful wailings come of wild despair:<br>
 But hark! the <i>dal-khis'</i> song rings on the air!<br>
 With groans and cries they shriek their mad despair.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Oh, fling on earth, ye demons dark,<br>
   Your madness, hate, and fell despair,<br>
 And fling your darts at each we mark,<br>
   That we may welcome victims here.</p>
 <p>Then sing your song of hate, ye fiends,<br>
   And hurl your pestilential breath,<br>
 Till every soul before us bends,<br>
   And worship here the god of Death.</p>
 <p> </p></dir>

 <p>In error still for e'er and aye,<br>
   They see not, hear not many things;<br>
 The unseen forces do not weigh,<br>
   And each an unknown mystery brings.</p>
 <p>In error still for e'er and aye,<br>
   They delve for phantom shapes that ride<br>
 Across their minds alone,--and they<br>
   But mock the folly of man's pride.</p>
 <p>In error still for e'er and aye!<br>
   They learn but little all their lives,<br>
 And Wisdom ever wings her way,<br>
   Evading ever,--while man strives!</p>
 <p>But hark! another song rings through the gloom,<br>
   And, oh, how sweet the music far doth come!<br>
 Oh, hear it, all ye souls in your despair,<br>
   For joy it brings to sorrowing ones e'en here!</p>
 <p>"There is a Deep Unknown beyond,<br>
   That all things hidden well doth weigh!<br>
 On man's blind vision rests the bond<br>
   Of error still for e'er and aye!</p>
 <p>But to the mighty gods, oh, turn<br>
   For truth to lead you on your way,<br>
 And wisdom from their tablets learn,<br>
   And ever hope for e'er and aye!"</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>And see! the hags disperse within the gloom,<br>
 As those sweet sounds resound within the room;<br>
 And now a glorious light doth shine around,<br>
 Their rays of peace glide o'er the gloomy ground.<br>
 And lo! 'tis Papsukul, our god of Hope,--<br>
 With cheerful face comes down the fearful slope<br>
 Of rugged crags, and blithely strides to where<br>
 Our hero stands, amid the poisonous air,<br>
 And says:<br>
              "Behold, my King, that glorious Light<br>
 That shines beyond! and eye no more this sight<font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> </p>
 <p><a name="page_129"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 129</font></a></p>
 <p>Of dreariness, that only brings despair,<br>
 For phantasy of madness reigneth here!"<br>
 The King in wonder carefully now eyes<br>
 The messenger divine with great surprise,<br>
 And says:<br>
              "But why, thou god of Hope, do I<br>
 Thus find thee in these realms of agony?<br>
 This World around me banishes thy feet<br>
 From paths that welcome here the god of Fate<br>
 And blank despair, and loss irreparable.<br>
 Why comest thou to woe immeasurable?"</p>
 <p>"You err, my King, for hope oft rules despair;<br>
 I ofttimes come to reign with darkness here;<br>
 When I am gone, the god of Fate doth reign;<br>
 When I return, I soothe these souls again."<br>
 "So thus you visit all these realms of woe,<br>
 To torture them with hopes they ne'er can know?<br>
 Avaunt! If this thy mission is on Earth<br>
 Or Hell, thou leavest after thee but dearth!"<br>
 "Not so, my King! behold yon glorious sphere,<br>
 Where gods at last take all these souls from here!<br>
 Adieu! thou soon shalt see the World of Light,<br>
 Where joy alone these souls will e'er delight."</p>
 <p>The god now vanishes away from sight,<br>
 The hero turns his face toward the light;<br>
 Nine <i>kaspu</i> walks, till weird the rays now gleam,<br>
 As <i>zi-mu-ri</i> behind the shadows stream.<br>
 He sees beyond, umbrageous grots and caves,<br>
 Where odorous plants entwine their glistening leaves.<br>
 And lo! the trees bright flashing gems here bear!<br>
 And trailing vines and flowers do now appear,<br>
 That spread before his eyes a welcome sight,<br>
 Like a sweet dream of some mild summer night.<br>
 But, oh! his path leads o'er that awful stream,<br>
 Across a dizzy arch 'mid sulphurous steam<br>
 That covers all the grimy bridge with slime.<br>
 He stands perplexed beside the waters grime,<br>
 Which sluggish move adown the limbo black,<br>
 With murky waves that writhe demoniac,--<font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> </p>
 <p><a name="page_130"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 130</font></a></p>
 <p>As ebon serpents curling through the gloom<br>
 And burl their inky crests, that silent come<br>
 Toward the yawning gulf, a tide of hate;<br>
 And sweep their dingy waters to Realms of Fate.</p>
 <p>He cautious climbs the slippery walls of gloom,<br>
 And dares not look beneath, lest Fate should come;<br>
 He enters now the stifling clouds that creep<br>
 Around the causeway, while its shadows sleep<br>
 Upon the stream that sullen moves below,--</p>
 <p>He slips!--and drops his torch! it far doth glow<br>
 Beneath him on the rocks! Alas, in vain<br>
 He seeks a path to bring it back again.<br>
 It moves! snatched by a <i>dal-khu's</i> hand it flies<br>
 Away within the gloom, then falling dies<br>
 Within those waters black with a loud hiss<br>
 That breaks the silence of that dread abyss.</p>
 <p>He turns again, amid the darkness gropes,<br>
 And careful climbs the cragged, slimy slopes,<br>
 And now he sees, oh, joy! the light beyond!<br>
 He springs! he flies along the glowing ground,<br>
 And joyous dashes through the waving green<br>
 That lustrous meets his sight with rays serene,<br>
 Where trees pure amber from their trunks distil,<br>
 Where sweet perfumes the groves and arbors fill,<br>
 Where zephyrs murmur odors from the trees,<br>
 And sweep across the flowers, carrying bees<br>
 With honey laden for their nectar store;<br>
 Where humming sun-birds upward flitting soar<br>
 O'er groves that bear rich jewels as their fruit,<br>
 That sparkling tingle from each youngling shoot,<br>
 And fill the garden with a glorious blaze<br>
 Of chastened light and tender thrilling rays.<br>
 He glides through that enchanted mystic world,<br>
 O'er streams with beds of gold that sweetly twirled<br>
 With woven splendor 'neath the blaze of gems<br>
 That crown each tree with glistening diadems.<br>
 The sounds of streams are weft with breezes, chant<br>
 Their arias with trembling leaves,--the haunt<font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> </p>
 <p><a name="page_131"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 131</font></a></p>
 <p>Of gods! O how the tinkling chorus rings!<br>
 With rhythms of the unseen rustling wings<br>
 Of souls that hover here where joy redeems<br>
 Them with a happiness that ever gleams.</p>
 <p>The hero stands upon a damasked bed<br>
 Of flowers that glow beneath his welcome tread,<br>
 And softly sink with 'luring odors round,<br>
 And beckon him to them upon the ground.<br>
 Amid rare pinks and violets he lies,<br>
 And one sweet pink low bending near, he eyes.<br>
 With tender petals thrilling on its stem,<br>
 It lifts its fragrant face and says to him,<br>
 "Dear King, wilt thou love me as I do thee?<br>
 We love mankind, and when a mortal see<br>
 We give our fragrance to them with our love,<br>
 Their love for us our inmost heart doth move."<br>
 The King leans down his head, it kissing, says,<br>
 "Sweet beauty, I love thee? with thy sweet face?<br>
 My heart is filled with love for all thy kind.<br>
 I would that every heart thy love should find."<br>
 The fragrant floweret thrills with tenderness,<br>
 With richer fragrance answers his caress.<br>
 He kisses it again and lifts his eyes,<br>
 And rises from the ground with glad surprise.</p>
 <p>And see! the glorious spirits clustering round!<br>
 They welcome him with sweet melodious sound.<br>
 We hear their golden instruments of praise,<br>
 As they around him whirl a threading maze;<br>
 In great delight he views their beckoning arms,<br>
 And lustrous eyes, and perfect, moving forms.<br>
 And see! he seizes one bright, charming girl,<br>
 As the enchanting ring doth nearer whirl;<br>
 He grasps her in his arms, and she doth yield<br>
 The treasure of her lips, where sweets distilled<br>
 Give him a joy without a taint of guilt.<br>
 It thrills his heart-strings till his soul doth melt,<br>
 A kiss of chastity, and love, and fire,<br>
 A joy that few can dare to here aspire.</p>
 <p><a name="page_132"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 132</font></a></p>
 <p>The beauteous spirit has her joy, and flees<br>
 With all her sister spirits 'neath the trees.<br>
 And lo! the <i>gesdin</i> <a name="fr_258"></a><a href="#fn_255"><font size="1">1</font></a> shining stands,<br>
 With crystal branches in the golden sands,<br>
 In this immortal garden stands the tree,<br>
 With trunk of gold, and beautiful to see.<br>
 Beside a sacred fount the tree is placed,<br>
 With emeralds and unknown gems is graced,<br>
 Thus stands, the prince of emeralds, <a name="fr_259"></a><a href="#fn_256"><font size="1">2</font></a> Elam's tree,<br>
 As once it stood, gave Immortality<br>
 To man, and bearing fruit, there sacred grew,<br>
 Till Heaven claimed again Fair Eridu. <a name="fr_260"></a><a href="#fn_257"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>
 <p>The hero now the wondrous fountain eyes;<br>
 Its beryl base to ruby stem doth rise,<br>
 To emerald and sapphire bands that glow,<br>
 Where the bright curvings graceful outward flow;<br>
 Around the fountain to its widest part,<br>
 The wondrous lazite bands now curling start<br>
 And mingle with bright amethyst that glows,<br>
 To a broad diamond band,--contracting grows<br>
 To <i>uk-ni</i> stone, turquoise, and clustering pearls,<br>
 Inlaid with gold in many curious curls<br>
 Of twining vines and tendrils bearing birds,<br>
 Among the leaves and blooming flowers, that words<br>
 May not reveal, such loveliness in art,<br>
 With fancies spirit hands can only start<br>
 From plastic elements before the eye,<br>
 And mingle there the charms of empery.<br>
 Beneath two diamond doves that shining glow<br>
 Upon the summit, the bright waters flow,<br>
 With aromatic splendors to the skies,<br>
 While glistening colors of the rainbow rise.</p>
 <p>Here ends the tablet, <a name="fr_261"></a><a href="#fn_258"><font size="1">4</font></a> "When the hero viewed<br>
 The fountain which within the garden stood."</p>
