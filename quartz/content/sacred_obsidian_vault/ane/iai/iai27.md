 <h3 align="CENTER">THE KING'S ANSWER AND ISHTAR'S RAGE</h3>
 <p>Amazed the sovereign sat upon his throne;<br>
 And while she wooed, his heart was turned to stone;<br>
 In scorn replied:<br>
                    "Rise Ishtar, Heaven's high queen,<br>
 Though all thy wealth, possessions I had seen<br>
 Now piled before me, all in gems and gold,<br>
 Of all the wealth of Heaven there heaped of old,<br>
 I nakedness and famine would prefer<br>
 To all the wealth divine thou canst confer.<br>
 What carest thou for earthly royalty?<br>
 The cup of poison shall thy lovers see.<br>
 Thou sawest me within a haunt away<br>
 From men. I lingered on that direful day,<br>
 And took thee for a beauteous <i>zi-re-mu</i> <a name="fr_216"></a><a href="#fn_214"><font size="1">1</font></a><br>
 Or <i>zi-ar-i-a</i> or a <i>zi-lit-tu</i>, <a name="fr_217"></a><a href="#fn_215"><font size="1">2</font></a><br>
 And thou didst cause to enter love divine.<br>
 As <i>zi-cur-un-i</i>, spirit of the wine,<br>
 Thou didst deceive me with thine arts refined,<br>
 And love escaped upon the passing wind.<br>
 Then to my palace come, and me there seek;<br>
 Didst place thy mouth upon my lips, and wake<br>
 Within my breast a dream of love and fire,<br>
 Till I awoke and checked thy wild desire;<br>
 Thou earnest with the form of spirits fair,<br>
 Didst hover o'er me in my chamber there.<br>
 Thy godly fragrance from the skies above,<br>
 A sign did carry of the Queen of Love:<br>
 I woke, and thou didst vanish, then didst stand</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_82"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 82</font></a></p>
 <p>As mine own servant in my palace grand.<br>
 Then as a skulking foe, a mystic spell<br>
 Didst weave, and scorch me with the fires of hell<br>
 While I was wrapped in sleep. Again I woke,<br>
 I saw around me <i>dal-khi</i>, sulphurous smoke,<br>
 Which thou didst send around my royal bed;<br>
 And I believed that I was with the dead,<br>
 With <i>dal-khi</i> gloating over me in hell.<br>
 My <i>su-khu-li</i> then sought thy presence fell.<br>
 Forever may thy wooing cease! for love<br>
 Hath fled, may godly praises never move<br>
 Upon the lips of holy gods, or men,--<br>
 Of thee, the god of Love ne'er speak again!<br>
 I loved thee once; with love my heart inflamed<br>
 Once sought thee, but my troubles I have blamed<br>
 Upon thee, for the dreams which thou didst send.<br>
 Go! rest thy heart; and to thy pleasures wend!</p>
 <p>For Tammuz of thy youth thy heart once wailed,<br>
 For years his weary form thy love assailed;<br>
 Allala next, the eagle, lovest, tore<br>
 His wings. No longer could he joyful soar<br>
 And float above the forest to the sky.<br>
 Thou leavest him with fluttering wings to die.<br>
 A lusty lion thou didst love, his might<br>
 Destroyed, and plucked his claws in fierce delight,<br>
 By sevens plucked, nor heard his piteous cry.<br>
 A glorious war-steed next thy love didst try,<br>
 Who yielded to thee, till his strength was gone:<br>
 For seven <i>kaspu</i> <a name="fr_218"></a><a href="#fn_216"><font size="1">3</font></a> thou didst ride upon<br>
 Him without ceasing, gave no food nor drink,<br>
 Till he beneath thee to the earth did sink,<br>
 And to his mistress, Sil-i-li, the steed<br>
 Returned with broken spirit, drooping head.<br>
 Thou lovest Tabulu, the shepherd king,<br>
 And from his love continuous didst wring<br>
 <i>Sem-uk-ki</i>, <a name="fr_219"></a><a href="#fn_217"><font size="1">4</font></a> till he to appease thy love,<br>
 The mighty gods of heaven then sought to move<font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_83"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 83</font></a></p>
 <p>To pity with his daily offerings.<br>
 Beneath thy wand upon the ground he springs,<br>
 Transformed to a hyena; then was driven<br>
 From his own city--by his dogs was riven.<br>
 Next Is-ul-lan-u lov'st, uncouth, and rude,<br>
 Thy father's laborer, who subject stood<br>
 To thee, and daily scoured thy vessels bright:<br>
 His eyes from him were torn, before thy sight.<br>
 And chained before thee, there thy lover stood,<br>
 With deadly poison placed within his food.<br>
 Thou sayst:<br>
                "O Isullanu, stretch thy hand!<br>
 The food partake, that doth before thee stand!<br>
 Then with thy hand didst offer him the food.<br>
 He said: 'What askest thou? It is not good!<br>
 I will not eat the poison thus prepared.'<br>
 Thy godly wand him from thy presence cleared,<br>
 Transformed him to a pillar far away.<br>
 And for my love Queen Ishtar comes this day?<br>
 As thou hast done with others, would thy love<br>
 Return to me, thine actions all doth prove."</p>
 <p>The queen in fury from his presence turned,<br>
 In speechless rage the palace halls she spurned;<br>
 And proudly from the earth swept to the skies;<br>
 Her godly train in terror quickly flies.</p>
