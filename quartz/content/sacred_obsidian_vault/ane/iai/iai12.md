 <h3 align="CENTER">EXPEDITION OF ZAIDU IN SEARCH OF THE SEER</h3>
 <p>Prince Zaidu on his steed now hastes away,<br>
 Upon the plains he travelled all that day;<br>
 Next morn the Za-Gabri he slow ascends,<br>
 Along the mountain sides the horseman wends<br>
 Beneath the Eri-ni, <a name="fr_117"></a><a href="#fn_117"><font size="1">1</font></a> and cliffs, and sees<br>
 The plains and mountains o'er the misty trees<br>
 From the wild summit, and old Khar-sak glow<br>
 Above them all with its twin crests of snow.<br>
 He plunges in the wild to seek the cave;<br>
 Three days unceasing sought young Zaidu brave,<font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_39"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 39</font></a></p>
 <p>And now at last within the glen he rode,<br>
 And near approached Heabani's wild abode.<br>
 At last he sees the seer before his home,<br>
 And with his monster <a name="fr_118"></a><a href="#fn_118"><font size="1">2</font></a> now toward him come,<br>
 That walked subdued beside the hermit seer,<br>
 Thus they upon the rocks above appear.</p>
 <p>"Why art thou here in warrior's array?<br>
 The hermit cries. "I know thee not! away!"</p>
 <p>"O holy seer, 'tis Zaidu, from our Sar!<br>
 The king of Erech, chieftain Izdubar."</p>
 <p>"What seekest thou within my mountain lair?"<br>
 Heabani angry cried. "What brings thee here?"</p>
 <p>"For thee! if true Heabani is thy name;<br>
 I seek the hermit seer of wondrous fame.<br>
 My king doth offer thee rich gifts of state,<br>
 And sent me to thee here to make thee great.<br>
 No empty honors do I seek, which void<br>
 Of all true happiness, all men have cloyed.<br>
 Return then to thy haunts of pleasure, pain,<br>
 For thy king's embassy is all in vain."<br>
 The seer returns within his lonely cave<br>
 And leaves the prince alone the beast to brave.<br>
 At last it slinks away within the gloom;<br>
 No more from their wild home doth either come,<br>
 Three days Prince Zaidu watches the dark lair,<br>
 But now his courage turns to blank despair:<br>
 The seer hath changed his mind since Samas sought<br>
 To urge him forth to leave his lonely lot.<br>
 The prince the mountain precipice now climbs,<br>
 And peers within while clinging to the limbs<br>
 Of stunted oaks, and views the mountain lair;<br>
 But all in vain his calls ring on the air.<br>
 Then mounting wearily his steed he turns<br>
 Away, and unsuccessful thus returns.</p>
