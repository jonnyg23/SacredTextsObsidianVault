 <h3 align="CENTER">ISHTAR'S DESCENT TO HADES--HER FEARFUL RECEPTION</h3>
 <p>To Hades' darkened land, whence none return,<br>
 Queen Ishtar, Sin's great daughter, now doth turn;<br>
 Inclined her ear and listened through the void<br>
 That lay beneath of every path devoid,<br>
 The home of darkness, of the Under-World,<br>
 Where god Ir-kal-la <a name="fr_233"></a><a href="#fn_231"><font size="1">1</font></a> from the heights was hurled.<br>
 The land and road from whence is no return,<br>
 Where light no entrance hath to that dark bourne;<br>
 Where dust to dust returns, devouring clods;<br>
 Where light dwells not in Tsil-lat-tus abodes;<br>
 Where sable ravens hovering rule the air;<br>
 O'er doors and bolts dust reigneth with despair.<br>
 Before the gates of gloom the Queen now stands,<br>
 And to the keeper Ishtar thus commands:<br>
 "O keeper of the waters! open wide<br>
 Thy gate, that I through these dark walls may glide;<br>
 But if thou open'st not the gate for me,<br>
 That I may enter, shattered thou shalt see<br>
 The doors and bolts before thee lying prone,<br>
 And from the dust shall rise each skeleton,<br>
 With fleshless jaws devour all men with thee,<br>
 Till death shall triumph o'er mortality."<br>
 The keeper to the Princess Ishtar said:<br>
 "Withhold thy speech! or Allat's fury dread!<br>
 To her I go to bid thee welcome here."<br>
 To Allat then the keeper doth appear:<br>
 "Thy sister Ishtar the dark waters seeks--<br>
 The Queen of Heaven," thus Allat's fury breaks.<br>
 "So like an herb uprooted comes this Queen,<br>
 To sting me as an asp doth Ishtar mean?<br>
 What can her presence bring to me but hate?<br>
 Doth Heaven's Queen thus come infuriate?"<br>
 And Ishtar thus replies: "The fount I seek,</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_92"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 92</font></a></p>
 <p>Where I with Tammuz, my first love, may speak;<br>
 And drink its waters, as sweet nectar-wines,<br>
 Weep o'er my husband, who in death reclines;<br>
 My loss as wife with handmaids I deplore,<br>
 O'er my dear Tammuz let my teardrops pour."<br>
 And Allat said, "Go! keeper, open wide<br>
 The gates to her! she hath me once defied;<br>
 Bewitch her as commanded by our laws."<br>
 To her thus Hades opened wide its jaws.</p>
 <p>"Within, O goddess! Cutha thee receives!<br>
 Thus Hades' palace its first greeting gives."<br>
 He seized her, and her crown aside was thrown.<br>
 "O why, thou keeper, dost thou seize my crown?<br>
 "Within, O goddess! Allat thee receives!<br>
 'Tis thus to thee our Queen her welcome gives."<br>
 Within the next gate he her earrings takes,<br>
 And goddess Ishtar now with fury shakes,<br>
 "Then why, thou slave, mine earrings take away?"<br>
 "Thus entrance, goddess, Allat bids this day."<br>
 At the third gate her necklace next he takes,<br>
 And now in fear before him Ishtar quakes.<br>
 "And wilt thou take from me my gems away?"<br>
 "Thus entrance, goddess, Allat bids this day."<br>
 And thus he strips the goddess at each gate,<br>
 Of ornaments upon her breast and feet<br>
 And arms; her bracelets, girdle from her waist,<br>
 Her robe next took, and flung the Queen undrest<br>
 Within a cell of that dark solitude.<br>
 At last, before Queen Ishtar Allat stood,<br>
 When she had long remained within the walls<br>
 And Allat mocked her till Queen Ishtar falls<br>
 Humiliated on the floor in woe;<br>
 Then turning wildly, cursed her ancient foe.<br>
 Queen Allat furious to her servant cries:<br>
 "Go! Naintar! with disease strike blind her eyes!<br>
 And strike her side! her breast and head and feet;<br>
 With foul disease her strike, within the gate!"</p>
