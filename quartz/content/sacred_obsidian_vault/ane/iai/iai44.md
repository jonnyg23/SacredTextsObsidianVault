 <h3 align="CENTER">THE KING'S ADVENTURE AT THE GATE OF THE GARDEN OF THE GODS WITH THE TWO MAIDENS--ONE OF THEM LEADS HIM INTO THE HAPPY HALLS--SONGS OF THE SABITU AND ZI-SI.</h3>
 <p>A gate half opened shows the silvery sea<br>
 Yet distant shining lambent on his way.<br>
 And now he sees young Siduri, <a name="fr_262"></a><a href="#fn_259"><font size="1">1</font></a> whose breast<br>
 Infuses life; all nature she hath blest,<br>
 Whose lips are flames, her arms are walls of fire,<br>
 Whose love yields pleasures that can never tire,<br>
 She to the souls who joy on earth here miss,<br>
 Grants them above a holier, purer bliss.<br>
 The maiden sits within a holy shrine<br>
 Beside the gate with lustrous eyes divine,<br>
 And beckons to the King, who nearer comes,<br>
 And near her glows the Happy Palace domes.</p>
 <p>And lo! 'tis she his lips have fondly kissed<br>
 Within the garden, when like fleeing mist<br>
 She disappeared with the bright spirit Seven, <a name="fr_263"></a><a href="#fn_260"><font size="1">2</font></a><br>
 The Sabit, who oft glide from earth to Heaven.<br>
 And lo I one of the Seven, Sabitu,<br>
 Emerging from the gate doth jealous view<br>
 The coming hero who hath kissed her mate,<br>
 She angry springs within to close the gate,<br>
 And bars it, enters then the inner halls,<br>
 And Izdubar to her now loudly calls,<br>
 "O Sabitu! what see-est thou, my maid?<br>
 Of Izdubar is Sabitu afraid?<br>
 Thy gate thou barrest thus before my face.<br>
 Quick, open for me! or I'll force the brass!"<br>
 The maid now frightened opens wide the door.</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_134"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 134</font></a></p>
 <p>The Sar and Siduri now tread the floor<br>
 Of the bright palace where sweet joy doth reign.<br>
 Through crystal halls 'neath golden roofs the twain<br>
 Next go within a lofty ceilinged hall,<br>
 With shining pearlèd columns, golden wall,<br>
 And purple silken hangings at each door,<br>
 With precious gems inlaid upon the floor;<br>
 Where couches grand are spread for one to rest<br>
 Beneath the softened rays that sweet invest<br>
 The senses with a thrill of happiness;<br>
 Where Siduri with joy all souls doth bless.<br>
 The maid sits on a couch and turns her face<br>
 Toward the King with that immortal grace<br>
 That love to gods and men will e'er bestow.<br>
 Their eyes now mingling with a happy glow,<br>
 The maiden sweetly says: "Where wouldst thou go?<br>
 Within these Happy Halls we joy but know,<br>
 And if thou wilt, my King, my heart is thine!<br>
 Our love will ever bring us bliss divine."</p>
 <p>"Alas, my maid, thy love to me is dear,<br>
 And sad am I that I must go from here.<br>
 I came from Erech by advice from one<br>
 I loved more than thou canst e'er know, but gone<br>
 From me is my Heabani, faithful seer.<br>
 Across a desert waste have I come here,<br>
 And he has there to dust returned,--to dust--<br>
 O how the love of my friend I did trust!<br>
 I would that we had never started here,<br>
 I now must find the great immortal seer."</p>
 <p>The maiden turns her glowing eyes on him,<br>
 Replies: "My King, thou knowest joy may gleam,<br>
 Take courage, weary heart, and sing a song!<br>
 The hour of sorrow can never be long;<br>
 The day will break, and flood thy soul with joy,<br>
 And happiness thy heart will then employ!<br>
 Each day must end with all its sorrow, woe,<br>
 Oh, sing with me, dear heart! I love thee so!"<br>
 And lo! the curtains flung aside, now comes</p>
 <p><a name="page_135"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 135</font></a></p>
 <p>The joyous Sabitu from yonder rooms,<br>
 And gathering round, a song they gayly sing,<br>
 Oh, how with music the bright walls now ring!<br>
 If evil thou hast done, my King,</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>        Oh, pray! oh, pray!<br>
 And to the gods thy offerings bring,<br>
         And pray! and pray!<br>
 The sea is roaring at thy feet,<br>
 The storms are coming, rain and sleet;<br>
         To all the gods,<br>
 Oh, pray to them I oh, pray!</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <i></i><p align="CENTER">Chorus</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>        To all the gods,<br>
 Oh, pray to them! oh, pray!</p>
 <p>Thy city we will bless, O Sar!<br>
         With joy, with joy!<br>
 And prosper thee in peace and war<br>
         With joy, with joy!<br>
 And bless thee every day and night,<br>
 Thy kingly robes keep pure and bright;<br>
         Give thee bright dreams,<br>
 O glorious king of war!</p></dir>

 <dir>
 
 <p>        Give thee bright dreams,<br>
 O glorious king of war!</p>
 <p>And if thy hand would slay thy foes<br>
         In war, in war!<br>
 With thee returning victory goes<br>
         In war, in war!<br>
 We grant thee victory, my King;<br>
 Like marshes swept by storms, we bring<br>
         Our power to thee<br>
 With victory in war!</p></dir>

 We'll go with thee in every place,<br>
         With thee, with thee!<br>
 To Hea's halls and glorious throne,<br>
 Where he unrivalled reigns alone,<br>
         To Hea go<br>
 Upon his throne of snow.</p></dir>

 <p>        To Hea go<br>
 Upon his throne of snow.</p>
 <p>And if thine anger rules thy heart<br>
         As fire, as fire!<br>
 And thou against thy foes would start<br>
         With ire, with ire!<br>
 Against thy foes thy heart be hard,<br>
 And all their land with fire be scarred,<br>
         Destroy thy foes!<br>
 Destroy them in thine ire!</p></dir>

 <p>        Destroy thy foes!<br>
 Destroy them in thine ire!</p></dir>

 <p>And lo! young Siduri hath disappeared,<br>
 And with the Zisi crowned she now appeared;<br>
 The corn-gods in a crescent round their queen,<br>
 She waves before the king her Nusku <a name="fr_264"></a><a href="#fn_261"><font size="1">3</font></a> green,<br>
 And sings with her sweet voice a joyful lay,<br>
 And all the Zisi join the chorus gay:</p>

 <p>The singing spirits from them fled, and he<br>
 Alone stood thinking by young Siduri.</p>
 <p>The King leaned on his bow, and eyed the maid,<br>
 A happy look came in his eyes,--and fled,<br>
 For lo! the curtain quick aside is pushed,<br>
 And Sabitu within upon them rushed.<br>
 She stately glides across the shining floor,<br>
 And eyes them both, then turns toward the door.<br>
 But Izdubar is equal to the task,<br>
 With grace now smiling, of the maid doth ask:<br>
 "O Sabitu! wouldst thou tell me the way<br>
 To Khasisadra? for I go this day.<br>
 If I the sea may cross, how shall I go?<br>
 Or through the desert? thou the path mayst know."<br>
 The maiden startled looks upon his face,<br>
 And thus she answers him with queenly grace:<br>
 "So soon must go? Thou canst not cross the sea,<br>
 For thou wilt perish in the waves that way.<br>
 Great Samas once the way of me did ask,<br>
 And I forbade him, but the mighty task<br>
 He undertook, and crossed the mighty deep,<br>
 Where Death's dark waters lie in wait asleep:<br>
 His mighty car of gold swept through the skies,<br>
 With fiery chargers now he daily flies.<br>
 When I approach thee, thou from me wouldst flee?<br>
 But if thou must so soon thus go, the sea<br>
 Perhaps thou too canst cross, if thou wilt 'void<br>
 Death's waters, which relentless ever glide.<br>
 But Izdubar, Ur-Hea, here hath come!<br>
 The boatman of the seer, who to his home<br>
 Returns. He with an axe in yonder woods<br>
 A vessel builds to cross the raging floods.<br>
 If thou desirest not to cross with him,<br>
 We here will welcome thee through endless time;<br>
 But if thou goest, may they see thy face<br>
 Thou seekest,--welcome thee, and thy heart bless."</p>
