 <h3 align="CENTER">THE KING IS CURED BY THE INCANTATIONS OF KHASISADRA AND HE BECOMES IMMORTAL</h3>
 <p>When Izdubar awakes, they lead the way<br>
 To the bright fount beside the jasper sea.<br>
 The seer, with Mua and Ur-Hea, stands<br>
 Beside the King, who holily lifts his hands<br>
 Above an altar where the glowing rays<br>
 Of sacred flames are curling; thus he prays:</p>
 <p>"Ye glorious stars that shine on high,<br>
 Remember me! Oh, hear my cry,<br>
 Su-ku-nu, <a name="fr_281"></a><a href="#fn_278"><font size="1">1</font></a> bright Star of the West!<br>
 Dil-gan, my patron star, oh, shine!<br>
 O Mar-bu-du, whose rays invest<br>
 Dear Nipur <a name="fr_282"></a><a href="#fn_279"><font size="1">2</font></a> with thy light divine,<br>
 The flames that shines, upon the Waste!<br>
 O Papsukul, thou Star of Hope,<br>
 Sweet god of bliss, to me, oh, haste,<br>
 Before I faint and lifeless drop!<br>
 O Adar <a name="fr_283"></a><a href="#fn_280"><font size="1">3</font></a> Star of Ninazu,<br>
 Be kind! O Ra-di-tar-tu-khu.<br>
 Sweet U-tu-ca-ga-bu, <a name="fr_284"></a><a href="#fn_281"><font size="1">4</font></a> dear Star<br>
 With thy pure face that shines afar!</p>
 <p>Oh, pardon me! each glorious Star!<br>
 Za-ma-ma, <a name="fr_285"></a><a href="#fn_282"><font size="1">5</font></a> hear me! O Za-ma-ma!<br>
 Ca-ca-ma u Ca-ca-ma." <a name="fr_286"></a><a href="#fn_283"><font size="1">6</font></a></p>
 <p> <a name="fr_287"></a><a href="#fn_284"><font size="1">7</font></a> Remember him! O dear Za-ma-ma!<br>
 Ca-ca-ma u Ca-ca-ma."</p>

 <p>As Izdubar doth end his holy prayer<br>
 He kneels, and they now bear his body where<br>
 A snowy couch doth rest beneath a shrine<br>
 That stands near by the glowing fount divine,<br>
 And Khasisadra lifts his holy hands,<br>
 His incantation chants, and o'er him stands.</p>
 <p>"O Bel, Lord of An-nu-na-ci,<br>
 O Nina, Hea's daughter! Zi! <a name="fr_288"></a><a href="#fn_285"><font size="1">8</font></a><br>
 This Incantation aid,<br>
 Remember us, Remember!</p>
 <p> <a name="fr_289"></a><a href="#fn_286"><font size="1">9</font></a> Ye tempests of High Heaven, be still!<br>
 Ye raging lightnings, oh, he calm!<br>
 From this brave man his strength is gone,<br>
 Before thee see him lying ill!<br>
 Oh, fill with strength his feeble frame,<br>
 O Ishtar, shine from thy bright throne!<br>
 From him thine anger turn away,<br>
 Come from thy glowing mountains, come!<br>
 From paths untrod by man, oh, haste!<br>
 And bid this man arise this day.<br>
 With strength divine as Heaven's dome,<br>
 His form make pure and bright and chaste!<br>
 The evil curse, oh, drive away!</p>
 <p>Go! A-sac-cu-kab-bi-lu, <a name="fr_290"></a><a href="#fn_287"><font size="1">10</font></a> go!<br>
 O Nam-ta-ru-lim-nu, <a name="fr_291"></a><a href="#fn_288"><font size="1">1</font></a> oh, fly!<br>
 U-tuc-cu-lim-nu <a name="fr_292"></a><a href="#fn_289"><font size="1">2</font></a> from him flow!<br>
 A-lu-u-lim-nu, <a name="fr_293"></a><a href="#fn_290"><font size="1">3</font></a> hence! away!<br>
 E-ci-mu-lim-nu, <a name="fr_294"></a><a href="#fn_291"><font size="1">4</font></a> go! thou fiend!<br>
 Fly, Gal-lu-u-lim-nu, <a name="fr_295"></a><a href="#fn_292"><font size="1">5</font></a> afar!<br>
 Fly from his head! his life! I send<br>
 Thee, fiend! depart from Izdubar!<br>
 Go from his forehead, breast, and heart,<br>
 And feet! Avaunt! thou fiend! depart!</p>

 <p>Oh, from the Curse, Thou Spirit High!<br>
 And Spirit of the Earth, come nigh!<br>
 Protect him, may his spirit fly!<br>
 O Spirit of the Lord of Lands,<br>
 And Goddess of the Earthly Lands,<br>
 Protect him! raise with strength his hands!</p>
 <p>Oh, make him as the Holy Gods,<br>
 His body, limbs, like thine Abodes,<br>
 And like the Heavens may he shine!<br>
 And like the Earth with rays divine!<br>
 Quick! with the khis-ib-ta <a name="fr_296"></a><a href="#fn_293"><font size="1">6</font></a> to bring<br>
 High Heaven's Charm--bind round his brow!<br>
 The sis-bu <a name="fr_297"></a><a href="#fn_294"><font size="1">7</font></a> place around his hands!<br>
 And let the sab-u-sat <a name="fr_298"></a><a href="#fn_295"><font size="1">8</font></a> bright cling!<br>
 The mus-u-kat <a name="fr_299"></a><a href="#fn_296"><font size="1">9</font></a> lay round him now,<br>
 And wrap his feet with rad-bat-bands, <a name="fr_300"></a><a href="#fn_297"><font size="1">10</font></a><br>
 And open now his zik-a-man <a name="fr_301"></a><a href="#fn_298"><font size="1">1</font></a><br>
 The sis-bu cover, and his hands<br>
 The bas-sat <a name="fr_302"></a><a href="#fn_299"><font size="1">2</font></a> place around his form!<br>
 From baldness and disease, this man<br>
 Cleanse, make him whole, head, feet, and hands!</p>
 <p>O Purity, breathe thy sweet charm!</p>
 <p>Restore his health and make his skin<br>
 Shine beautifully, beard and hair<br>
 Restore! make strong with might his loins!<br>
 And may his body glorious shine<br>
 As the bright gods!--</p>
 <p>                         Ye winds him bear!<br>
 Immortal flesh to his soul joins!</p>

 <p>Thou Spirit of this man! arise!<br>
 Come forth with joy! Come to the skies!"</p>
 <p>And lo! his leprosy has fled away!<br>
 He stands immortal,--purged! released from clay!</p>
