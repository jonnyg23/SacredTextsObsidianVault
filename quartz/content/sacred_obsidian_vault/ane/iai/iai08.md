 <h3 align="CENTER">ISHTAR'S MIDNIGHT COURTSHIP IN THE PALACE OF IZDUBAR.</h3>
 <p>As Samas' car sank in the glowing west,<br>
 And Sin the moon-god forth had come full drest<br>
 For starry dance across the glistening skies,<br>
 The sound of work for man on earth now dies,<br>
 And all betake themselves to sweet repose.<br>
 The silver light of Sin above bright flows,<br>
 And floods the figures on the painted walls,<br>
 O'er sculptured lions, softly, lightly falls;<br>
 Like grim and silent watch-dogs at the door<br>
 They stand; in marble check their leaping roar.<br>
 The King within his chamber went his way,<br>
 Upon his golden jewelled couch he lay.<br>
 The silken scarlet canopy was hung<br>
 In graceful drapery and loosely clung</p>
 <p><a name="page_27"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 27</font></a></p>
 <p>Around his couch, and purple damask cloths<br>
 Embroidered with rare skill, preserved from moths<br>
 By rich perfumes, to the carved lintel clung<br>
 In graceful folds; thus o'er the entrance hung.</p>
 <p>Queen Ishtar softly comes, and o'er his dreams<br>
 A mystic spell she draws, until it seems<br>
 While half awake he lies, that she is yet<br>
 Close nestling in his arms, as he had met<br>
 Her in the wood, and with her there reclined,<br>
 While her soft arms around him were entwined.<br>
 Thus while he sleeps she hovers o'er his bed<br>
 With throbbing heart, and close inclines her head<br>
 Until her lips near touch the sleeping King's,<br>
 But daring not to kiss.<br>
                           She love thus brings,<br>
 All through his dreams; until one misty night,<br>
 While be yet restless tossed, the lovely sprite<br>
 Sunk him to deeper sleep with her soft lyre<br>
 While hanging o'er his couch consumed with fire<br>
 That nestling around her heart-strings fiercely burned<br>
 Until at last lulled by the strain he turned<br>
 Upon his couch at rest, and she now lay<br>
 Beside him closely, when she heard him say:<br>
 "My love thou art, but canst not be!" No more<br>
 He murmurs, then inflamed she sought the door.<br>
 "Perchance the <i>su-khu-li</i> <a name="fr_73"></a><a href="#fn_73"><font size="1">1</font></a> sleep not!" she said;<br>
 And satisfied, turned where her lover laid;<br>
 And to his royal couch she crept again;<br>
 Her bliss will have despite of gods and men.<br>
 Her hot and burning lips cannot resist<br>
 The tempting treasure lying there, nor missed<br>
 Shall be the dearest joys of love from her<br>
 Who rules all hearts in Heaven, earth, and air.<br>
 Her right divine that blessing sweet to take,<br>
 She will assert, her burning thirst to slake.</p>
 <p>His couch the Heavenly Queen of Love now graces,<br>
 And on his breast her glorious head she places;<font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_28"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 28</font></a></p>
 <p>Embracing him, she softly through her lips<br>
 And his, the sweetest earthly nectar sips,<br>
 While he in sleep lies murmuring of love,<br>
 And she in blissful ecstasy doth move.<br>
 Her lips to his, she wildly places there,<br>
 Until to him it seems a fond nightmare.</p>
 <p>And thus, against his will, she fondly takes<br>
 What he her shall deny when he awakes,<br>
 The stolen kisses both the lovers thrill:<br>
 Unquenched her warm desire would kiss him still,<br>
 But his hot blood now warms him in his dream<br>
 Which is much more to him than it doth seem;<br>
 And clasping her within convulsing arms,<br>
 Receives a thrill that all his nerves alarms,<br>
 And wakes him from the dreams she had instilled.<br>
 "What means this fantasy that hath me filled,<br>
 And spirit form that o'er my pillow leans;<br>
 I wonder what this fragrant incense means?<br>
 Oh, tush! 'tis but an idle, wildering dream,<br>
 But how delightful, joyous it did seem!<br>
 Her beauteous form it had, its breath perfume;<br>
 Do spirit forms such loveliness assume?"</p>
 <p>The goddess yet dares not her form reveal,<br>
 And quickly she herself doth now conceal<br>
 Behind the damask curtains at the door.<br>
 When he awoke, sprang to the chamber floor,<br>
 As his own maid the queen herself transforms,<br>
 Says entering in haste:<br>
                           "What wild alarms<br>
 Thee, Sar?" and then demure awaits reply,<br>
 In doubt to hear or to his bosom fly.<br>
 "My maid art thou? 'Tis well, for I have dreamed<br>
 Of spirits, as a Zi-ru fair it seemed."</p>
