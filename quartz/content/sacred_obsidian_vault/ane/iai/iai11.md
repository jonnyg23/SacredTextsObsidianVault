 <h3 align="CENTER">HEABANI, THE HERMIT SEER</h3>
 <p>Before a cave within the Gab-ri <a name="fr_114"></a><a href="#fn_114"><font size="1">1b</font></a> wild,<br>
 A seer is resting on a rock; exiled<br>
 By his own will from all the haunts of men,<br>
 Beside a pool, within a rocky glen<br>
 He sits; a turban rests upon his brow,<br>
 And meets the lengthened beard of whitest snow.<br>
 This morn an omen comes before his eyes,<br>
 And him disturbs with a wild eagle's cries<br>
 That fierce attacks a fox before his cave;<br>
 For he of beasts is the most cunning knave;</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_37"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 37</font></a></p>
 <p>In wait upon the ground the fox hath lain<br>
 To lure the bird, which flying deems him slain.<br>
 He fiercely seizes it, as swooping down,<br>
 The bird with its sly quarry would have flown;<br>
 But the <i>a-si</i> <a name="fr_115"></a><a href="#fn_115"><font size="1">2</font></a> quick seized it by the throat,<br>
 While the wide wings with frantic fury smote<br>
 The beast, and the sharp talons deeply tore<br>
 Its foe--both greedy for the other's gore.</p>
 <p>And lo! a voice from yonder sky resounds;<br>
 Heabani to his feet now quickly bounds,<br>
 And bowing, listens to the voice that comes<br>
 In gentleness; upon the winds it roams<br>
 From yon blue heights like sighing of the trees;<br>
 The seer in reverence upon his knees<br>
 Now holy bares his head in Samas' rays,<br>
 While the soft voice to him thus gently says:<br>
 "A messenger, Heabani, soon shall come<br>
 With offers rich, to leave thy lonely home.<br>
 This eagle sought its food and found a snare,<br>
 The messenger will come from Izdubar,<br>
 To learn from thee the meaning of his dream<br>
 Which goddess Ishtar sent,--a snare for him.<br>
 Then to the messenger prove not a snare,<br>
 As yonder <i>a-si</i> doth the eagle tear."</p>
 <p>The seer in fury tore his beard of snow<br>
 And cried--<br>
               "Alas! my days shall end in woe<br>
 Within these wilds my happiness is mine,<br>
 No other joys I seek, my god divine;<br>
 I would upon these rocks lie down to die,<br>
 Upon my back here sleep eternally."<br>
 And Samas urging, to him thus replied:<br>
 "Heabani, hast thou not some manly pride?<br>
 And thinkest thou no joy thou here wilt lose?<br>
 The lovely Sam-kha-tu <a name="fr_116"></a><a href="#fn_116"><font size="1">3</font></a> the seer may choose.<br>
 Arrayed in trappings of divinity<br>
 And the insignia of royalty,</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_38"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 38</font></a></p>
 <p>Heabani then in Erech shall be great,<br>
 And live in happiness and royal state;<br>
 And Izdubar shall hearken, and incline<br>
 His heart in warmest friendship, and recline<br>
 With thee upon a couch of luxury,<br>
 And seat thee on a throne of royalty,<br>
 On his left hand, a crown shall grace thy brow.<br>
 Kings of the earth shall to thee subject bow<br>
 And kiss thy feet, and Izdubar shall give<br>
 Thee wealth, and thou in luxury shalt live.<br>
 In silence Erech's men shall bow to thee,<br>
 In royal raiment thou shalt happy be."<br>
 Heabani listened to the words that came<br>
 From Samas, and his brow was lit with shame<br>
 To hear the god of war urge him to go<br>
 To earthly happiness--mayhap to woe;<br>
 But he within his cave now listless turns<br>
 When Samas ceased; then to his rock returns,<br>
 And seats himself with calmness on his brow;<br>
 His thoughts in happy memories now flow,<br>
 And he recalls the blissful days of yore<br>
 When he as seer lived on Euphrates' shore,<br>
 As the queen's bard oft tuned a festive lay,<br>
 While soft-eyed maidens dance and cymbals play.</p>
