 <h3 align="CENTER">CORONATION OF IZDUBAR</h3>
 <p>A crowd of maidens led a glorious van;<br>
 With roses laden the fair heralds ran,<br>
 With silver-throated music chant the throng,<br>
 And sweetly sang the coronation song:<br>
 And now we see the gorgeous cavalcade,<br>
 Within the walls in Accad's grand parade<br>
 They pass, led by the maidens crowned with flowers,<br>
 Who strew the path with fragrance;--to the towers<br>
 And walls and pillars of each door bright cling<br>
 The garlands. Hear the maidens joyful sing!</p>
 <p>"Oh, shout the cry! Accadians, joyful sing<br>
 For our Deliverer! Oh, crown him King!<br>
 Then strew his path with garlands, tulips, rose,<br>
 And wave his banners as he onward goes;<br>
 Our mighty Nin-rad comes, oh, raise the cry!<br>
 We crown Tar-u-ma-ni iz-zu sar-ri!</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Away to Samas' temple grand, away!<br>
   For Accad crowns him, crowns him there!<br>
 He is our chosen Sar <a name="fr_49"></a><a href="#fn_49"><font size="1">1</font></a> this glorious day,<br>
   Oh, send the Khanga <a name="fr_50"></a><a href="#fn_50"><font size="1">2</font></a> through the air!</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>Then chant the chorus, all ye hosts above!<br>
 O daughters, mothers, sing for him we love!<br>
 His glory who can sing, who brings us joy?<br>
 For hope and gladness all our hearts employ.<br>
 He comes, our hope and strength in every war:<br>
 We crown him as our king, our Izdubar!</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Away to Samas' temple grand, away!<br>
   For Accad crowns him, crowns him there!<br>
 He is our chosen Sar this glorious day,<br>
   Oh, send the Khanga through the air!</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>Toward the temple filed the long parade,<br>
 The nobles led while Accad's music played;</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_18"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 18</font></a></p>
 <p>The harps and timbrels, barsoms, drums and flutes<br>
 Unite with trumpets and the silver lutes.<br>
 Surrounded by his chieftains rides the Sar<br>
 In purple robes upon his brazen car.<br>
 Bedecked with garlands, steeds of whitest snow<br>
 The chariot draw in state with movement slow,<br>
 Each steed led by a <i>kisib</i>, nobleman,<br>
 A score of beauteous horses linked in span.<br>
 The army follows with their nodding plumes,<br>
 And burnished armor, trumpets, rolling drums,<br>
 And glistening spears enwreathed with fragrant flowers,<br>
 While scarfs are waving from the crowded towers.,<br>
 And shouts of joy their welcome loud proclaim,<br>
 And from each lip resounds their monarch's name.</p>
 <p>And now before the holy temple stands<br>
 The chariot, in silence cease the bands.<br>
 Around an altar stand the waiting priests,<br>
 And held by them, the sacrificial beasts.<br>
 The hero from his chair descends,<br>
 And bowing to the priests, he lowly bends<br>
 Before the sacred altar of the Sun,<br>
 And prays to Samas, Accad's Holy One.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p> <a name="fr_51"></a><a href="#fn_51"><font size="1">3</font></a>"O Samas, I invoke thee, throned on high!<br>
   Within the cedars' shadow bright thou art,<br>
 Thy footing rests upon immensity;<br>
   All nations eagerly would seek thy heart.<br>
 Their eyes have turned toward thee, O our Friend!<br>
   Whose brilliant light illuminates all lands,<br>
 Before thy coming all the nations bend,<br>
   Oh, gather every people with thy hands!<br>
 For thou, O Samas, knowest boundaries<br>
   Of every kingdom, falsehood dost destroy,<br>
 And every evil thought from sorceries<br>
   Of wonders omens, dreams that do annoy,<br>
 And evil apparitions, thou dost turn<br>
   To happy issue; malice, dark designs;</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_19"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 19</font></a></p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>And men and countries in thy might o'erturn,<br>
   And sorcery that every soul maligns.<br>
 Oh, in thy presence refuge let me find!<br>
   From those who spells invoke against thy King,<br>
 Protect one! and my heart within thine, oh, bind!<br>
    <a name="fr_52"></a><a href="#fn_52"><font size="1">4</font></a> Thy breath within mine inmost soul, oh, bring!<br>
 That I with thee, O Samas, may rejoice.<br>
   And may the gods who me created, take<br>
 Thy hands and lead me, make thy will my choice,<br>
    <a name="fr_53"></a><a href="#fn_53"><font size="1">5</font></a> Direct my breath, my hands, and of me make<br>
 They servant, Lord of light of legions vast,<br>
   O Judge, thy glory hath all things surpassed!"</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>The King then rises, takes the sacred glass, <a name="fr_54"></a><a href="#fn_54"><font size="1">6</font></a><br>
 And holds it in the sun before the mass<br>
 Of waiting fuel on the altar piled.<br>
 The centring rays--the fuel glowing gild<br>
 With a round spot of fire and quickly. spring<br>
 Above the altar curling, while they sing!</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p> <a name="fr_55"></a><a href="#fn_55"><font size="1">7</font></a> "Oh, to the desert places may it fly,<br>
   This incantation holy!<br>
 O spirit of the heavens, us this day<br>
   Remember, oh, remember!<br>
 O spirit of the earth, to thee we pray,<br>
   Remember! Us remember!</p>
 <p>"O God of Fire! a lofty prince doth stand,<br>
   A warrior, and son of the blue sea,<br>
 Before the God of Fire in thine own land,<br>
   Before thy holy fires that from us free<br>
 Dread Darkness, where dark Nuk-khu reigns.<br>
   Our prince, as monarch we proclaim,<br>
 His destiny thy power maintains,<br>
   Oh, crown his glory with wide fame!</p>
 <p>"With bronze and metal thou dost bless<br>
   All men, and givest silver, gold.</p></dir>

 <p>The goddess with the hornèd face<br>
   Did bless us with thee from of old.<br>
 From dross thy fires change gold to purity;<br>
   Oh, bless our fire-king, round him shine<br>
 With Heaven's vast sublimity!<br>
   And like the earth with rays divine,<br>
   As the bright walls of Heaven's shrine."</p>
