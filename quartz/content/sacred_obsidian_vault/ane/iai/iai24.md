 <h3 align="CENTER">EXPEDITION AGAINST KHUMBABA, AND BATTLE IN THE BLACK FOREST</h3>
 <p>At early dawn the shining ranks are massed,<br>
 And Erech echoes with the trumpet's blast;<br>
 The chosen men of Erech are in line,<br>
 And Ishtar in her car above doth shine.<br>
 The blazing standards high with shouts are raised,<br>
 As Samas' car above grand Sumir blazed.<font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> </p>
 <p><a name="page_73"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 73</font></a></p>
 <p>The march they sound at Izdubar's command,<br>
 And thus they start for King Khumbaba's land;<br>
 The gods in bright array above them shine,<br>
 By Ishtar led, with Samas, moon-god Sin,<br>
 On either sidle with Merodac and Bel,<br>
 And Ninip, Nergal, Nusku with his spell,<br>
 The sixty gods on chargers of the skies,<br>
 And Ishtar's chariot before them flies.</p>
 <p>Across Cazina's desert far have come,<br>
 The armies now have neared Khumbaba's home;<br>
 Beneath grand forests of tall cedar, pine,<br>
 And the dark shades near Khar-sak's brow divine.<br>
 A brazen gate before them high appeared,<br>
 And massive walls which their great foe had reared;<br>
 The mighty gates on heavy pivots hung,<br>
 They broke, and on their brazen hinges swung<br>
 With clanging roars against the solid wall,<br>
 And sent through all the wilds a clarion call.<br>
 Within his halls Khumbaba is enthroned,<br>
 In grand Tul-Khumba's walls by forests zoned<br>
 With her bright palaces and templed shrines,<br>
 The sanctuaries of the gods, where pines<br>
 Sigh on the wafting winds their rich perfumes;<br>
 Where Elam's god with sullen thunder dooms<br>
 From Kharsak's brow the wailing nation's round,<br>
 And Elam's; hosts obey the awful sound.<br>
 The giant here his castled city old<br>
 Had strengthened, wrung his tributes, silver, gold;<br>
 His palace ceiling with pure silver shines,<br>
 And on his throne of gold from Magan's <a name="fr_205"></a><a href="#fn_203"><font size="1">1</font></a> mines<br>
 In all his pride the conqueror exults,<br>
 With wealth has filled his massive iron vaults.<br>
 Oft from his marble towers the plains surveys,<br>
 And sees his foes' most ancient cities blaze;<br>
 While his <i>pa-te-si</i> lead his allied hosts,<br>
 And o'er his famous victories he boasts.</p>
 <p>With Rimsin he allied when Erech fell,<br>
 The King of Sarsa, whose great citadel<font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_74"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 74</font></a></p>
 <p>Was stormed by Nammurabi the great Sar,<br>
 Ninrad of Erech, our King Izdubar.<br>
 Khumbaba's ally was by him o'erthrown,<br>
 And thus appeared to take Khumbaba's throne.<br>
 And now within his palace came a sound<br>
 That roared through all the forest, shook the ground:<br>
 "Our foes! our foes! the gate! hear how it rings!"<br>
 And from his throne the giant furious springs:<br>
 "Ho! vassals! sound the trump! 'tis Izdubar,<br>
 To arms! our foes are on us from afar!"<br>
 His weapons seizes, drives his men in fear<br>
 Before him with his massive sword and spear,<br>
 And as a tempest from his lips he pours<br>
 His orders, while his warrior steed he spurs<br>
 Along his serried lines of bristling spears;<br>
 Among the pines the army disappears.</p>
 <p>The men of Accad now in squadrons form,<br>
 Arrayed to take Khumbaba's towers by storm;<br>
 While Izdubar the forest black surveyed<br>
 Of pines and cedars thickly grown, and made<br>
 A reconnoitre of his hidden foe.<br>
 The road was straight; afar the turrets glow<br>
 With Samas' light, and all the gods arrayed,<br>
 Ride o'er the pines and flash through their dark shade.<br>
 The glorious blaze of Accad's glistening spears<br>
 One <i>kaspu</i> pass, and now the foe appears;<br>
 Beneath the deepest shadows of the pines<br>
 Khumbaba stands with solid battle lines<br>
 Before the marching host of Izdubar.<br>
 The forest echoes with the shouts of war,<br>
 As they sweep on with ringing battle cries,<br>
 Now loudly echoed from the woods and skies:<br>
 "<i>Kar-ro</i>! <i>kar-ra</i>! <a name="fr_206"></a><a href="#fn_204"><font size="1">2</font></a> we follow Izdubar!"<br>
 And through the forests fly the bolts of war.</p>
 <p>The foe beheld the gods in wrath above<br>
 And Accad's charging lines toward them move,<br>
 But bravely stand to meet the onset fierce,<br>
 Their mailed armor, shields, no arrows pierce.</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_75"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 75</font></a></p>
 <p>And now in direst conflict meet the mass,<br>
 And furious still meets ringing bronze and brass,<br>
 Khumbaba on his mighty steed of war,<br>
 Above the ranks towers high a giant Sar,<br>
 And sweeps the men of Accad with his blade,<br>
 Till to his breast a heap of corpses made,<br>
 And fiercely urged his men to fight, to die;<br>
 And Izdubar, with helmet towering high,<br>
 His men has led with fury on the foe,<br>
 And massacres each man with one fell blow,<br>
 Who dares to stand in front with sword or spear,<br>
 And fighting by him stands his valiant seer.<br>
 The gods now rushing from the gleaming sky,<br>
 With blazing weapons carry victory;<br>
 The foe no longer stand before the sight,<br>
 And shouting fly away in wild affright.<br>
 Their monarch turned and slowly rode away;<br>
 And Accad's hosts his men pursue and slay,<br>
 Until the forest deep resounds with cries.<br>
 To save himself each man in terror flies.</p>
