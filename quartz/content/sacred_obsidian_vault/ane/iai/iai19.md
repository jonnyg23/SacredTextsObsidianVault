 <h3 align="CENTER">IZDUBAR SLAYS THE MIDANNU IN THE FESTIVE HALL, AND HEABANI DECLARES HIM TO BE A GOD</h3>
 <p>The guests are seated round the festal board;<br>
 Heabani takes his seat beside his lord.<br>
 The choicest viands of the wealthy plain<br>
 Before them placed and fishes of the main,<br>
 With wines and cordials, juices rich and rare<br>
 The chieftains all enjoy--the royal fare.<br>
 This day, with Izdubar they laugh and joke<br>
 'Mid courtesies and mirth, and oft provoke<br>
 The ringing merry laughter through the halls.<br>
 When all are satisfied within the walls,<br>
 Their fill have eaten of the royal fare,<br>
 With wine they banish from them every care.</p>
 <p>The Su-khu-li <a name="fr_166"></a><a href="#fn_166"><font size="1">1</font></a> with tinkling bells proclaim,<br>
 "Our Sar would speak! Our king of mighty fame."<br>
 Who says: "My chieftains, lords, our seer requests<br>
 A test of strength before assembled guests;<br>
 Unarmed requires your Sar-dan-nu to slay<br>
 The Mid-an-nu <a name="fr_167"></a><a href="#fn_167"><font size="1">2</font></a> which he hath brought to-day.<br>
 So stand aside, my friends, behold the test!<br>
 Your Sar will satisfy his seer and guest."<br>
 The monster now is brought before the king,<br>
 Heabani him unchains to let him spring<br>
 Upon the giant king. His chieftains stand<br>
 In terror looking at their monarch grand,<br>
 Who smiling stands, his eyes on the beast fixed;<br>
 While they in wildest terror are transfixed.</p>

 <p>Heabani claps his hands towards the king,<br>
 And the wild beast upon his form doth spring.<br>
 The giant grasps its throat in high mid-air,<br>
  <a name="fr_168"></a><a href="#fn_168"><font size="1">3</font></a> And holds it 'neath his arm without a fear.<br>
 With sullen choking roars it struggling dies,<br>
 While shouts of joy from all the guests arise.<br>
 The mighty deed of strength the seer appals,<br>
 And at the feet of Izdubar he falls:<br>
 "Immortal king! illustrious of men!<br>
 Thy glorious strength reveals the gods again<br>
 On earth. To thee I bow in reverent fear,<br>
 A god returned thou art! O Erech, hear!<br>
 Of kingdoms thou art blessed with grandest fame,<br>
 That thou among thy kings a god can name."<br>
 Again they gathered round the festal board,<br>
 And joy and revelry they soon restored.<br>
 The revels high are raised o'er sparkling wine;<br>
 Through all the night they praise their king divine.</p>
