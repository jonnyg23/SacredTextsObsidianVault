 <h3 align="CENTER">IZDUBAR FALLS IN LOVE WITH ISHTAR, THE QUEEN OF LOVE</h3>
 <p>The hour has come when Izdubar will seek<br>
 The cool enchantment of the cove, and slake<br>
 His thirst with its sweet waters bubbling pure,<br>
 Where Love has spread for him her sweetest lure,<br>
 The maids expectant listening, watch and wait<br>
 His coming; oft in ecstacies they prate<br>
 O'er his surprise, and softly sport and splash<br>
 The limpid waves around, that glowing flash<br>
 Like heaps of snowy pearls flung to the light<br>
 By Hea's <a name="fr_67"></a><a href="#fn_67"><font size="1">1</font></a> hands, his Zir-ri <a name="fr_68"></a><a href="#fn_68"><font size="1">2</font></a> to delight.<br>
 And now upon the rock each maid reclines,<br>
 While Ishtar's form beneath them brightly shines;<br>
 Beside the fountain stands the lovely god,<br>
 The graceful sovereign of Love's sweet abode.</p>
 <p>"He comes; the shrubs of yonder jasmine near<br>
 Are rustling, oh, he comes! my Izdubar!"<br>
 And thus her love she greets: "Why art thou here?<br>
 Thou lovely mortal! king art thou, or seer?<br>
 We reck not which, and welcome give to thee;<br>
 Wouldst thou here sport with us within the sea?"<br>
 And then, as if her loveliness forgot,<br>
 She quickly grasped her golden locks and wrought<br>
 Them round her form of symmetry with grace<br>
 That well became a god, while o'er her face<br>
 Of sweetest beauty blushes were o'erspread;<br>
 "Thou see-est only Nature's robe," she said.<br>
 "'Tis all I wish while sporting with my maids,<br>
 And all alone no care have we for jades;<br>
 And if with thee we can in truth confide,<br>
 We here from all the world may cosey hide."<br>
 She hurls a glance toward him, smiling naïve,<br>
 Then bounding from the rock, peeps from a wave;<br>
 The waters fondling her surround, embrace<br>
 Her charms; and now emerging with rare grace,</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_24"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 24</font></a></p>
 <p>She turning says:<br>
                      "Make haste, my hearts!<br>
 Come forth! attend your queen!" and then she parts<br>
 The azure waves, to where, in dumb surprise,<br>
 The King enchanted stands, and fondly eyes<br>
 The Queen divine, while fascinating thrills<br>
 Sweep wildly through his breast; as fragrance fills<br>
 The rose-tree groves, or gardens of the gods,<br>
 Or breezes odorous from the Blest Abodes.<br>
 A longing, rising, fills his inmost soul<br>
 For this sweet queen who offers him a goal<br>
 His stormy life has never known, since he,<br>
 His loved one lost beneath the raging sea;<br>
 And all his calm resolves to seek no more<br>
 A joy which passed and left his heart forlore,<br>
 Are breaking, vanishing beneath her charms,<br>
 Dissolving as the mists, when sunlight warms<br>
 The earth, then scorching drinks the rising dews;<br>
 Till he at last no longer can refuse,<br>
 And love directs while he the goddess greets:<br>
 "Such wondrous beauty here no mortal meets;<br>
 But come, thou Zir-ru, <a name="fr_69"></a><a href="#fn_69"><font size="1">3</font></a> with me sweetly rest;<br>
 Primroses, gentians, with their charms invest<br>
 My mossy couch, with odorous citron-trees<br>
 And feathery palms above; and I will please<br>
 Thee with a mortal's love thou hast not known;<br>
 In pure love mingling let our spirits run,<br>
 For earthly joys are sweeter than above,<br>
 That rarest gift, the honeyed kiss of love<br>
 On earth, is sweeter bliss than gods enjoy;<br>
 Their shadowy forms with love cannot employ<br>
 Such pleasure as a mortal's sweet caress.<br>
 Come, Zi-ru, and thy spirit I will bless;<br>
 The Mandrake <a name="fr_70"></a><a href="#fn_70"><font size="1">4</font></a> ripened golden, glows around;<br>
 The fruit of Love is fragrant on the ground."</p>
 <p>Amid the Dud'im <a name="fr_71"></a><a href="#fn_71"><font size="1">5</font></a> plants he now reclines,<br>
 And to his welcome fate himself resigns;</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_25"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 25</font></a></p>
 <p>The lovely queen beside him now doth lay,<br>
 And leads his soul along the blissful way<br>
 That comes to every heart that longs for love,<br>
 When purest joy doth bless us from above;<br>
 From her soft liquid eyes the love-light speaks,<br>
 And her warm hands she lays in his, and wakes<br>
 Beneath her touch a thrill of wild desire,<br>
 Until his blood now seems like molten fire.<br>
 Her eyes half closed begat a passion wild,<br>
 With her warm breast, her loves hath beguiled;<br>
 She nearer creeps with hot and balmy breath,<br>
 And trembling form aglow, and to him saith:<br>
 "My lips are burning for a kiss, my love!"<br>
 A prize like this, a heart of stone would move,<br>
 And he his arms around her fondly placed<br>
 Till she reclined upon his breast, embraced,<br>
 Their lips in one long thrilling rapture meet.<br>
 But hark! what are these strains above so sweet<br>
 That float around, above, their love surround?<br>
 An-nu-na-ci <a name="fr_72"></a><a href="#fn_72"><font size="1">6</font></a> from forests, mounts around,<br>
 And from the streams and lakes, and ocean, trees,<br>
 And all that haunt the godly place, to please<br>
 The lovers, softly chant and dance around<br>
 To cymbals, lyres until the rocks resound,<br>
 Of goddess Ishtar chant, and Izdubar,<br>
 The Queen of Love wed to the King of War.<br>
 And he alarmed starts up and springs away,<br>
 And furious cries, to Ishtar's wild dismay:</p>
 <p>"What meanest thou, thou wanton brazen thing?<br>
 Wouldst thou on me the direst curses bring?"<br>
 And lo! the goddess is transformed! the crown<br>
 Of her own silver skies shines like the sun,<br>
 And o'er her dazzling robes a halo falls;<br>
 Her stately form with glory him appals,<br>
 For Heaven's dazzling splendor o'er her flows,<br>
 With rays celestial; o'er her brow there glows<br>
 A single star.</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_26"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 26</font></a></p>
 <p>               "Have I embraced a god?"<br>
 He horrified now cries; and she doth nod<br>
 Assent.<br>
          "But, oh I wilt thou thy queen forgive?<br>
 I love thee! stay! oh, stay! my heart you grieve!<br>
 He springs beyond the mystic circling ring,<br>
 And from their sight thus glides the angry King.<br>
 Beneath the wood himself he doth disguise<br>
 In tattered garments, on his steed he flies;<br>
 And when he comes in sight of Erech's gate,<br>
 His beggar's mantle throws aside; in state<br>
 Again enrobed, composed his anxious face,<br>
 Through Erech's gates he rides with kingly grace;<br>
 O'er his adventure thus the King reflects:<br>
 "Alas my folly leads, my life directs!<br>
 'Tis true, the goddess hath seductive charms,<br>
 E'en yet I feel her warm embracing arms.<br>
 Enough! her love from me I'll drive away;<br>
 Alas! for me, is this unfruitful day!"</p>
