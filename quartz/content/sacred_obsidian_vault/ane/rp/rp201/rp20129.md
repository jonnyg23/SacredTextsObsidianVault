 <p><a name="fn_251"></a><a href="rp20129.htm#fr_252">118:3</a> The <i>Pate’sis</i>, or high-priests of Assur, preceded the kings of Assyria, of whom the first is stated to have been Bel-kapkapu. As Samas-Rimmon, the high-priest, flourished 701 years before Tiglath-Pileser, his date would be about B.C. 1830. In Babylonia the high-priests were subject to a suzerain king; it is therefore probable that the high-priests of Assur also admitted the supremacy of a supreme monarch who may have ruled in Babylonia. Bricks have been found on the site of Ur in Babylonia bearing the name of Isme-Dagon, "king of Sumer and Accad," but he must <a name="page_119"><font size="1" color="green">p. 119</font></a> have lived at a much earlier period than Samas-Rimmon, whose Babylonian contemporary was Gul-kisar.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_252"></a><a href="rp20129.htm#fr_253">119:1</a> Another mode of spelling Nahri.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_253"></a><a href="rp20129.htm#fr_254">119:2</a> Literally "have not laid down my side at the work."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_254"></a><a href="rp20129.htm#fr_255">120:1</a> Thereby turning them into Beth-els or consecrated stones. Cf. Gen. xxviii. 18.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_255"></a><a href="rp20129.htm#fr_256">121:1</a> "Of sheep-breeding," a name of Sivan or May, according to W.A.I., v 43, 14.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_256"></a><a href="rp20129.htm#fr_257">121:2</a> Literally " the mighty men," like the <i>Gibborim</i> of the Old Testament; cf. 2 Sam. xxiii. 8. Assyrian chronology was reckoned according to the eponyms, officers who gave their name to each year of the king's reign. As the inscription of Rimmon-nirari I, who preceded Tiglath-Pileser I by about two hundred years, is dated in the eponymy of Shalman-garradu ("the god Solomon is a hero"), accurate chronology in Assyria went back to an early period.</p>
