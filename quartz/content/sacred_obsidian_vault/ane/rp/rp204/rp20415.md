 <p>1. Shalmaneser, the great king, the powerful king, the king of hosts, [the king of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Assyria</span>] …</p>  
 <p>2. the pitiless one, who subjugates the rebellious … [who a rival]</p>  
 <p>3. has not. The great, the incomparable, the heroic one, … [clothed]</p>  
 <p>4. with splendour, who fears not opposition; [who from the rising of the sun]</p>  
 <p>5. to the setting of the sun commands …</p>  
 <p>6. is powerful. In those days, through the great lord, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Merodach</span> …</p>  <h4 align="center">COLUMN II</h4>  
 <p>1. … [After that the gods] had placed in my hands the insignia of mankind, with the help of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Assur</span>, the great lord, my lord, and of the god who loves my priesthood, [I trod] the summits of all mountain-ranges</p>  
 <p>2. to the extremities of them all, [as far as] the sea of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Nairi</span> and the sea of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Zamua-sa-Bittani</span> <a name="fr_345"></a><a href="#fn_343"><font size="1">1</font></a> and the great sea of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Syria</span>. The country of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Hittites</span>, to its very extremities, like a mound</p>  
 <p>3. swept by the wind, I ravaged … I spread over the country of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Hittites</span> the [terror] of the glory of my sovereignty. In my passage from the sea <a name="fr_346"></a><a href="#fn_344"><font size="1">2</font></a> I</p>

 <p>4. … I marched [to] the great [sea]; I purified my weapons in the waters; I offered sacrifices to my gods; I received the tribute of all the kings of the shores of the sea.</p>  
 <p>5. … I erected [an image of my majesty beside] the sea; I wrote upon it; I set it up overlooking the sea. From the country of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Enzite</span> to the country of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dayaeni</span>, from the country of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dayaeni</span> to</p>  
 <p>6. [the country of] … I possessed myself [of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Arzashkun</span>, the royal city of Ara]me, of the land of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ararat</span>, I threw (it) down, dug (it) up and burnt (it) with fire. While I was staying in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Arzashkun</span>, Arame, of the country of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ararat</span>, to the multitude of his forces</p>  <h4 align="center">COLUMN III</h4>  
 <p>1. trusted and gathered all his troops; to give combat and battle he came against me. I utterly defeated him; I cut his fighting-men to pieces. I slew with weapons 3000 of his soldiers. With the bodies of his warriors</p>  
 <p>2. I filled the broad plain; I took from him his engines of war, his royal treasures (and) numerous war-material. To save his life he ascended an inaccessible mountain. Like <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Hadad</span> <a name="fr_348"></a><a href="#fn_346"><font size="1">2</font></a> I overthrew the widespread land of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Qute</span>. <a name="fr_349"></a><a href="#fn_347"><font size="1">3</font></a> From the city of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Arzashkun</span> to the country of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Guzan</span>,</p>  
 <p>3. from the country of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Guzan</span> to the country of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Khupushkia</span>, like the stormy Air-god I roared upon them. I displayed over the country of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ararat</span> the splendour of my sovereignty. Akhuni the son of Adini,</p>

 <p>who, with the permission of the kings my fathers, power and strength</p>  
 <p>4. had acquired, (whom) at the beginning of my reign I had shut up in his city, whose crops I had gathered, whose plantations I had cut down, to save (his) life had crossed the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Euphrates</span> (and) the city of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Shitamrat</span>, a mountain-peak which hangs from the sky like a cloud, for</p>  
 <p>5. his stronghold had taken. For the second time <a name="fr_350"></a><a href="#fn_348"><font size="1">1</font></a> I pursued after him; the mountain-peak I besieged. My soldiers swooped upon them like birds of prey. <a name="fr_351"></a><a href="#fn_349"><font size="1">2</font></a> I captured 17,500 of his troops. Akhuni with his troops, his gods, his chariots</p>  
 <p>6. (and) his horses, I caused to be brought before me; I carried (them) to my city of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Assur</span> [and settled them among the people of my own land.]</p>  <h4 align="center">COLUMN IV</h4>  
 <p>1. In the eponymy of Samas-bel-utsur, <a name="fr_352"></a><a href="#fn_350"><font size="1">3</font></a> in the time of Merodach-sum-iddin the king of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Babylonia</span>, <a name="fr_353"></a><a href="#fn_351"><font size="1">4</font></a> Merodach-bel-usâte his brother revolted against him. They divided the country into (two) factions. Merodach-sum-iddin to ask help to Shalmaneser sent</p>  
 <p>2. his ambassador. Shalmaneser, the impetuous chief, whose trust is <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Adar</span>, <a name="fr_354"></a><a href="#fn_352"><font size="1">5</font></a> took the road; he gave the order to march against <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Akkad</span>. <a name="fr_355"></a><a href="#fn_353"><font size="1">6</font></a> I approached the city of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Zaban</span>; <a name="fr_356"></a><a href="#fn_354"><font size="1">7</font></a> victims before <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Hadad</span> <a name="fr_357"></a><a href="#fn_355"><font size="1">8</font></a> my lord</p>  
 <p>3. I sacrificed. I departed from <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Zaban</span>; to the city of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mê-Turnat</span> I approached; <a name="fr_358"></a><a href="#fn_356"><font size="1">9</font></a> the city I besieged,</p>

 <p>4. I approached. Merodach-bel-usâte, the lame king, ignorant how to conduct himself, came forth against me to offer combat and battle. I utterly defeated him; his fighting-men I slew; in his city I shut him up. His crops</p>  
 <p>5. I gathered in; his plantations I cut; his river I dammed up. In a second expedition, in the eponymy of Bel-bunâya, <a name="fr_360"></a><a href="#fn_358"><font size="1">2</font></a> on the 10th day of the month Nisan, I departed from <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Nineveh</span>. The Upper <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Zab</span></p>  
 <p>6. and the Lower (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Zab</span>) I crossed. To the city of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lakhiru</span> I approached. The city I besieged, I captured. Its fighting-men I slew, its spoil I carried away. From the city of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lakhiru</span></p>  <h4 align="center">COLUMN V</h4>  
 <p>1. I departed. To the city of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Gan[na]nate</span> I approached. Merodach-bel-usâte came forth like a fox from his hole; towards the mountains of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Yasubi</span> he set his face. The city of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Arman</span></p>  
 <p>2. he took for his stronghold. The city of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Gannanate</span> I captured; its fighting-men I slew, its spoil I carried away. I ascended the mountains after him. In the city of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Arman</span> I shut him up; the city I besieged, I took. His fighting-men</p>  
 <p>3. I slew, his spoil I carried away. I put Merodach-bel-usâte to death with weapons. Of the miserable soldiers who (were) with him not one did I leave. When Merodach-sum-iddin had conquered his enemies, [and] Shalmaneser</p>  
 <p>4. the powerful king had fulfilled the desire of his heart, he exalted thee, O great lord <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Merodach</span>! Shalmaneser the king of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Assyria</span> ordered the march to <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Babylon</span>; he arrived at <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kutha</span>, <a name="fr_361"></a><a href="#fn_359"><font size="1">3</font></a> the city of the warrior of the gods <a name="fr_362"></a><a href="#fn_360"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>

Their propitiatory sacrifices (and) pure offerings on <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ê-Sagil</span></p>  <h4 align="center">COLUMN VI</h4>

 <p>3. the gods his lords he directed reverently his path. Strong oxen (and) fat sheep he gave in abundance. He visited all the shrines <a name="fr_369"></a><a href="#fn_363"><font size="1">3</font></a> in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Borsippa</span> and <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ê-Zida</span>; each time</p>  
 <p>4. he offered <i>libations</i> (?). For the men of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Babylon</span> and <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Borsippa</span>, the vassals of the great gods, he made a feast, and gave them food (and) wine; with embroidered robes he clothed (them); with presents</p>  
 <p>5. he endowed them. After that the great gods had favourably regarded Shalmaneser, the powerful king,</p>

His numerous soldiers I slew; their rich spoil, their oxen (and) their sheep, I carried away. The city I threw down, dug up (and) burned with fire. From the city of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Baqani</span> I departed; the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Euphrates</span> hard by it I crossed.
