 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The</span> following inscription was discovered by Sir A. H. Layard on a stone under the altar of the church of Surk Sahak at Van, and though the beginning and end of it are lost it supplements the great historical inscription of Argistis on the rock of Van, and is therefore given here. It was published by myself for the first time in my Memoir on the "Cuneiform Inscriptions of Van" in the <i>Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society</i>, xiv. 4. The translation of it I offered there can now be improved in several particulars. The inscription is numbered XLV in my Memoir.</p>
