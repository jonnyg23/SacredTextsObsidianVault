 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Precepts</span> of the prefect the feudal lord <a name="fr_71"></a><a href="#fn_71"><font size="1">1</font></a> Ptah-hotep, under the majesty of the king of the South and North, Assa, living eternally for ever.</p>  <h4 align="center">I</h4>  
 <p>The prefect, the feudal lord Ptah-hotep says: O God with the two crocodiles, <a name="fr_72"></a><a href="#fn_72"><font size="1">2</font></a> my lord, the progress of age changes into senility. Decay falls [upon man] and decline takes the place of youth. <a name="fr_73"></a><a href="#fn_73"><font size="1">3</font></a> A vexation weighs upon him every day; sight fails, the ear becomes deaf; his strength dissolves without ceasing. <a name="fr_74"></a><a href="#fn_74"><font size="1">4</font></a> The mouth is silent, speech fails him; the mind <a name="fr_75"></a><a href="#fn_75"><font size="1">5</font></a> decays, remembering not the day before. The whole body <a name="fr_76"></a><a href="#fn_76"><font size="1">6</font></a> suffers. That which is good</p>

 <p>becomes <a name="fr_77"></a><a href="#fn_77"><font size="1">1</font></a> evil; taste completely disappears. Old age makes a man altogether miserable; the nose is stopped up, breathing no more from exhaustion. <a name="fr_78"></a><a href="#fn_78"><font size="1">2</font></a> Standing or sitting there is here a condition (?) of … <a name="fr_79"></a><a href="#fn_79"><font size="1">3</font></a> Who will cause me to have authority to speak? <a name="fr_80"></a><a href="#fn_80"><font size="1">4</font></a> that I may declare to him the words of those who have heard the counsels of former days? And the counsels heard of the gods, who (will give me authority to declare them?) Cause that it be so and that evil be removed from those that are enlightened; send the double … <a name="fr_81"></a><a href="#fn_81"><font size="1">5</font></a></p>  
 <p>The majesty of this god says: Instruct him in the sayings of former days. It is this which constitutes the merit of the children of the great. All that which makes the soul equal penetrates him who hears it, and that which it says produces no satiety.</p>  <h4 align="center">II</h4>  
 <p>Beginning of the arrangement of the good saying(s), <a name="fr_82"></a><a href="#fn_82"><font size="1">6</font></a> spoken by the noble lord, the divine father, beloved of God, the son of the king, the first-born of his race, <a name="fr_83"></a><a href="#fn_83"><font size="1">7</font></a> the prefect (and) feudal lord Ptah-hotep, so as to instruct the ignorant in the knowledge of the arguments of the good saying(s). It is profitable for him who hears them, it is a loss to him who shall transgress them.</p>  
 <p>He says to his son: Be not arrogant because of that which thou knowest; deal with the ignorant as with the learned; for the barriers of art are not closed, no artist being in possession of the perfection to which he should aspire. <a name="fr_84"></a><a href="#fn_84"><font size="1">8</font></a> [But] good word(s) are more difficult to find than</p>

 <p>If thou findest a disputant while he is hot, <a name="fr_87"></a><a href="#fn_87"><font size="1">3</font></a> and if he is superior to thee in ability, lower the hands, bend the back, do not get into a passion with him. As he will not let thee destroy his words, it is utterly wrong to interrupt him; that proclaims that thou art incapable of keeping thyself calm, when thou art contradicted. <a name="fr_88"></a><a href="#fn_88"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>  
 <p>If then thou hast to do with a disputant while he is hot, imitate one who does not stir. <a name="fr_89"></a><a href="#fn_89"><font size="1">5</font></a> Thou hast the advantage over him if thou keepest silence when he is uttering evil words. "The better (of the two) is he who is impassive," say the bystanders, and thou art right in the opinion of the great.</p>  <h4 align="center">IV</h4>  
 <p>If <a name="fr_90"></a><a href="#fn_90"><font size="1">6</font></a> thou findest a disputant while he is hot, do not despise him, because thou art not of the same opinion. <a name="fr_91"></a><a href="#fn_91"><font size="1">7</font></a> Be not angry against him when he is wrong; away with such a thing. He fights against himself; require him not [further] to flatter thy feelings. <a name="fr_92"></a><a href="#fn_92"><font size="1">8</font></a> Do not amuse thyself with the spectacle which thou hast before thee; it is odious, [it is] mean, [it is the part] of a despicable soul [so to do].</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> As soon as thou lettest thyself be moved by thy feelings, combat this [desire] as a thing that is reproved by the great.</p>  <h4 align="center">V</h4>  
 <p>If thou hast, as leader, to decide on the conduct of a great number of men, seek the most perfect manner (of doing so) that thy [own] conduct may be without reproach. Justice is great, invariable and assured; it has not been disturbed since the age of Osiris. To throw obstacles in the way of the laws, is to [open] the way before violence. Shall that which is below gain the upper hand, if the unjust does not attain to the place of justice? <a name="fr_93"></a><a href="#fn_93"><font size="1">1</font></a> even he who says: I take for myself, of my own free-will; <a name="fr_94"></a><a href="#fn_94"><font size="1">2</font></a> but says not: I take by [virtue of] my authority. <a name="fr_95"></a><a href="#fn_95"><font size="1">3</font></a> The limitations of justice are invariable; such is the instruction which every man receives from his father.</p>  <h4 align="center">VI</h4>  
 <p>[Inspire not men with fear, [else] God will fight against thee] in the same manner. If any one asserts that he lives by such means, [God] will take away the bread from his mouth; if any one asserts that he enriches himself [thereby], [God] says: I may take [these riches] to myself. If any one asserts that he beats others, [God] will end by reducing him to impotence. Let no one inspire men with fear, this is the will of God. Let one provide sustenance for [them] in the lap of peace; it will [then] be that they will freely give [what has been torn from them by terror].</p>  <h4 align="center">VII</h4>  
 <p>If thou art among the persons seated [at meat] in the house of a greater man than thyself, <a name="fr_96"></a><a href="#fn_96"><font size="1">4</font></a> take that which he</p>

 <p>gives [thee], bowing to the ground. <a name="fr_97"></a><a href="#fn_97"><font size="1">1</font></a> Regard that which is [placed] before thee, [but] point not at it; regard it not <a name="fr_98"></a><a href="#fn_98"><font size="1">2</font></a> frequently; he is a blameworthy person who departs from this rule. Speak not to [the great man] more than he requires, for one knows not what may be displeasing [to him]. <a name="fr_99"></a><a href="#fn_99"><font size="1">3</font></a> Speak when he invites thee and thy word will be pleasing. <a name="fr_100"></a><a href="#fn_100"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>  
 <p>As for the great man who has plenty of means of existence his conduct is as he himself wishes. He does that which pleases him; if he desires to repose, he realises his [intention]. The great man stretching forth his hand does that to which [other] men do not attain. [But] as the means of existence are under the will of God, one cannot rebel against it.</p>  <h4 align="center">VIII</h4>  
 <p>If thou art one of those who bring the messages of one great man to another, conform thyself exactly to that wherewith he has charged thee; perform for him the commission as he hath enjoined thee. Beware of altering in speaking the offensive words which one great person addresses to another; he who perverts the truthfulness of his way, in order to repeat only what produces pleasure in the words of every man, great or small, is a detestable person.</p>  <h4 align="center">IX</h4>  
 <p>If thou art an agriculturist, gather the crops (?) in the field which the great God has given thee, fill not thy mouth in the house of thy neighbours; <a name="fr_101"></a><a href="#fn_101"><font size="1">5</font></a> it is better to make oneself dreaded by the possessor. <a name="fr_102"></a><a href="#fn_102"><font size="1">6</font></a> As for him who, master of his own way of acting, being all-powerful, <a name="fr_103"></a><a href="#fn_103"><font size="1">7</font></a> seizes [the goods of</p>

 <p>If thou abasest thyself <a name="fr_105"></a><a href="#fn_105"><font size="1">2</font></a> in obeying a superior, thy conduct is entirely good before God. Knowing who ought to obey and who ought to command, do not lift up thy heart against him. As thou knowest that in him is authority, be respectful towards him as belonging to him. Fortune comes only at her own good-will, and her caprice only is her law; as for him who … <a name="fr_106"></a><a href="#fn_106"><font size="1">3</font></a> God, who has created his superiority, turns himself from him and he is overthrown.</p>  <h4 align="center">XI</h4>  
 <p>Be active, <a name="fr_107"></a><a href="#fn_107"><font size="1">4</font></a> during the time of thy existence, doing more than is commanded. Do not spoil the time of thy activity; he is a blameworthy person who makes a bad use of his moments. Do not lose the daily opportunity of increasing that which thy house possesses. Activity produces riches and riches do not endure when it slackens.</p>  <h4 align="center">XII</h4>  
 <p>If thou art a wise man, bring up a son who shall be pleasing <a name="fr_108"></a><a href="#fn_108"><font size="1">5</font></a> to God. If he conforms his conduct to thy way and occupies himself with thy affairs as is right, do to him all the good thou canst; he is thy son, a [person] attached [to thee] whom thine own self hath begotten.

 <p>If thou art [employed] in the <i>larit</i>, stand or sit rather than walk about. Lay down rules for thyself from the first: not to absent thyself even when weariness overtakes thee. Keep an eye on him who enters announcing that what he asks is secret; <a name="fr_112"></a><a href="#fn_112"><font size="1">4</font></a> what is entrusted to thee <a name="fr_113"></a><a href="#fn_113"><font size="1">5</font></a> is above appreciation and all contrary argument is a matter to be rejected. He is a god who penetrates into a place where no relaxation [of the rules] is made for the privileged.</p>  <h4 align="center">XIV</h4>  
 <p>If thou art with people who display for thee an extreme affection, [saying]: "Aspiration of my heart, aspiration of my heart, where there is no remedy! That which is said in thy <a name="fr_114"></a><a href="#fn_114"><font size="1">6</font></a> heart, let it be realised by springing up spontaneously. Sovereign master, I give myself to thy opinion.

 <p>Declare thy line of conduct without reticence; give thy opinion in the council of thy lord; while there are people who turn back upon their own [words] when they speak, so as not to offend him who has put forward a statement, and answer not in this fashion: <a name="fr_120"></a><a href="#fn_120"><font size="1">6</font></a> "He is the great man who will recognise the error of another; and when he shall raise his voice to oppose the other <a name="fr_121"></a><a href="#fn_121"><font size="1">7</font></a> about it he will keep silence after what I have said." <a name="fr_122"></a><a href="#fn_122"><font size="1">8</font></a></p>  <h4 align="center">XVI</h4>  
 <p>If thou art a leader, setting forward thy plans <a name="fr_123"></a><a href="#fn_123"><font size="1">9</font></a> according to that which thou decidest, perform perfect actions which posterity may remember, without letting the words prevail [with thee] which multiply flattery, [which] excite pride and produce vanity.</p>  <h4 align="center">XVII</h4>  
 <p>If thou art a leader of peace, listen to the discourse of the petitioner. Be not abrupt with him; that would trouble him. Say not to him: "Thou hast [already] recounted this." Indulgence will encourage him to accomplish the</p>

As for being abrupt with the complainant because he described what passed when the injury was done, instead of complaining of the injury itself, <a name="fr_124"></a><a href="#fn_124"><font size="1">1</font></a> let it not be! The way to obtain a clear explanation is to listen with kindness. <a name="fr_125"></a><a href="#fn_125"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>  <h4 align="center">XVIII</h4>  
 <p>If thou desirest to excite respect within [the house] thou enterest, for example [the house] of a superior, a friend <a name="fr_126"></a><a href="#fn_126"><font size="1">3</font></a> or any person of consideration, [in short] everywhere where thou enterest, keep thyself from making advances to a woman, for there is nothing good in so doing. There is no prudence in taking part in it, and thousands of men destroy themselves in order to enjoy a moment, brief as a dream, while they gain death, so as to know it. It is a villainous <i>intention</i> (?), that of a man who [thus] excites himself (?); if he goes on to carry it out, his mind abandons him. For as for him who is without repugnance for such an [act], there is no good sense at all in him.</p>  <h4 align="center">XIX</h4>  
 <p>If thou desirest <a name="fr_127"></a><a href="#fn_127"><font size="1">4</font></a> that thy conduct should be good and preserved from all evil, keep thyself from [every] attack of bad humour. <a name="fr_128"></a><a href="#fn_128"><font size="1">5</font></a> It is a fatal malady which leads to discord, and there is no longer any existence for him who gives way to it. <a name="fr_129"></a><a href="#fn_129"><font size="1">6</font></a> For it [introduces] <i>discord</i> (?) between fathers and mothers, as well as between brothers and sisters; <a name="fr_130"></a><a href="#fn_130"><font size="1">7</font></a> it causes the wife [and] the husband to hate each other; it contains all kinds of wickedness, it embodies all kinds of wrong. <a name="fr_131"></a><a href="#fn_131"><font size="1">8</font></a> When a man has established his just equilibrium and walks in this path, there where he makes his dwelling, there is no room <a name="fr_132"></a><a href="#fn_132"><font size="1">9</font></a> for bad humour.</p>

Be not of an irritable temper in regard to thy neighbours; better is a compliment to that which displeases than rudeness.

It is that which fixes her in thy house; if thou repellest her, it is an <i>abyss</i> (?).

 <p>Do not repeat any extravagance of language; do not listen to it; it is a thing which has escaped from a hasty mouth. If it is repeated, look, without hearing it, towards the earth; say nothing in regard to it. Cause him who speaks to thee to know what is just, even him who provokes to injustice; <a name="fr_140"></a><a href="#fn_140"><font size="1">2</font></a> cause that [which is just] to be done, cause it to triumph.

 <p>If thou art a wise man, sitting in the council of thy lord, direct thy thought towards that which is wise. Be silent rather than scatter thy words. When thou speakest, know that which can be brought against thee. To speak in the council is an art, and speech is criticised more than any [other] labour; it is contradiction which puts it to the proof. <a name="fr_142"></a><a href="#fn_142"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>  <h4 align="center">XXV</h4>

Do not let thy orders remain unsaid and cause thy answers to penetrate; but speak without heat, assume a serious countenance.

The advantage of his son is to do that which is just without deceiving himself.</p>  <h4 align="center">XXXIX</h4>  
 <p>To attend [therefore] profits the son of him who has attended. To attend <a name="fr_182"></a><a href="#fn_182"><font size="1">3</font></a> is the result of the fact that one has attended. A [teachable] auditor is formed, because I have attended. Good when he has attended, good when he speaks, <a name="fr_183"></a><a href="#fn_183"><font size="1">4</font></a> he who has attended has profited, and it is profitable to attend to him who has attended. To attend is worth more than anything [else], for it produces love, the good thing that is twice good. The son who accepts the instruction of his father will grow old on that account. <a name="fr_184"></a><a href="#fn_184"><font size="1">5</font></a></p>  
 <p>What God loves is that one should attend; if one attends not, it is abhorrent to God. The heart makes itself its own master when it attends and when it does not attend; [but] if it attends, then his heart is a beneficent [master] to a man. <a name="fr_185"></a><a href="#fn_185"><font size="1">6</font></a> In attending to instruction, a man loves what he attends to, and to do that which is prescribed is pleasant. When a son attends to his father, it is a twofold joy [for both]; when [wise] things are prescribed to him, the son is gentle towards [his] master. Attending to him who has attended when such [things] have been prescribed to him, he engraves upon [his] heart that which is approved by his father; and the recollection of it is preserved in the mouth of the living who exist upon this earth.</p>  <h4 align="center">XL</h4>

 <p>man whose wisdom <a name="fr_186"></a><a href="#fn_186"><font size="1">1</font></a> is agreeable to the great. Let him direct his mouth <a name="fr_187"></a><a href="#fn_187"><font size="1">2</font></a> according to that which has been said to him; in the docility of a son is discovered his wisdom. His conduct is perfect, while error carries away the unteachable. <a name="fr_188"></a><a href="#fn_188"><font size="1">3</font></a> To-morrow knowledge will support him, while the ignorant will be destroyed.</p>  <h4 align="center">XLI</h4>  
 <p>As for the man without experience who listens not, he effects nothing whatsoever. He sees knowledge in ignorance, profit in loss; he commits all kinds of error, always accordingly choosing the contrary of what is praiseworthy. He lives on that which is mortal, in this fashion. His food are evil words whereat he is filled with astonishment. That which the great know to be mortal he lives upon every day, flying from that which would be profitable to him, <a name="fr_189"></a><a href="#fn_189"><font size="1">4</font></a> because of the multitude of errors which present themselves before him every day.</p>  <h4 align="center">XLII</h4>  
 <p>A son who attends is like a follower of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Horus</span>; he is happy after having attended. He becomes great, he arrives at dignity, he gives the same lesson to his children. Let none innovate upon the precepts of his father; let the same precepts form his lessons to his children. "Verily," will his children say to him, "to accomplish <a name="fr_190"></a><a href="#fn_190"><font size="1">5</font></a> what thou sayest works marvels."</p>  
 <p>Cause [therefore] that to flourish which is just, in order to nourish thy children [with it]. If the teachers allow themselves to be led towards evil principles verily the people who understand them not will speak accordingly, <a name="fr_191"></a><a href="#fn_191"><font size="1">6</font></a> and that being said to those who are docile, they will act accordingly. Then all the world considers them [as masters] and they inspire confidence in the public; but their glory endures not so long as would please them.

Attend [if] thou wishest to dwell in the mouth of those who shall attend to thy words, when thou hast entered upon the office of master, that thy words may be upon our lips … and that there may be a chair from which to deliver thy arguments. <a name="fr_193"></a><a href="#fn_193"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>  <h4 align="center">XLIII</h4>  
 <p>Let thy thoughts be abundant [but] let thy mouth be under restraint, and thou shalt argue with the great. Put thyself in unison with the ways of thy master; cause him to say: "He is my son," so that <a name="fr_194"></a><a href="#fn_194"><font size="1">3</font></a> those who shall hear it shall say: "Praise be to [her who] has borne him to him!" Apply thyself while thou speakest; speak [only] of perfect things; and let the great who shall hear thee say: "Twice good [is] that which issues from his mouth! "</p>  <h4 align="center">XLIV</h4>  
 <p>Do that which thy master bids thee. Twice good is the precept of our <a name="fr_195"></a><a href="#fn_195"><font size="1">4</font></a> father, from whom we have issued, from his flesh. What he tells us, let it be [fixed in our] heart; to satisfy him greatly let us do for him more than he has prescribed. Verily a good son is one of the gifts of God, [a son] who does [even] better than he has been told [to do]. <a name="fr_196"></a><a href="#fn_196"><font size="1">5</font></a> For his master he does what is satisfactory, putting himself with all his heart on the part [of right]. <a name="fr_197"></a><a href="#fn_197"><font size="1">6</font></a></p>

But it is Osiris reborn and regaining, after decline and death, rejuvenescence and vigour. Chabas (<i>Zeitschrift</i>, 1868, p. 10s), studying the stelæ of Horus standing on the crocodiles, and noticing that this god is named "the aged who becomes young in his hour, the old man who becomes a child," very justly recalls the passage of the <i>Papyrus Prisse</i> where Ptah-hotep invokes the aid of the god with the two crocodiles against the evils of old age.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_73"></a><a href="rp20306.htm#fr_73">16:3</a> Literally "comes upon newness." Doubtful translation; but I believe with Chabas that <i>mau</i> expresses here the idea of "flourishing" or "brilliant youth" (as in the Book of the Dead, eh. 87, line 2). <i>Ahu</i> seems to be the contrary of <i>mau</i>, so I render it "decline."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_74"></a><a href="rp20306.htm#fr_74">16:4</a> We must read <i>an urd</i> and take no account of the <i>het</i> which follows and has been erroneously added by the scribe, accustomed to write the name of the god Urd-het.

 <p><a name="fn_103"></a><a href="rp20306.htm#fr_103">20:7</a> Literally "for the master of the manner of acting as master of the things." The author means the powerful man who abuses his power in order to plunder openly and to place himself above the laws.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_104"></a><a href="rp20306.htm#fr_104">21:1</a> This inversion of the words may be attributed to the exigencies of the rhythm.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_105"></a><a href="rp20306.htm#fr_105">21:2</a> Or perhaps "if thou doest evil."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_106"></a><a href="rp20306.htm#fr_106">21:3</a> I have not ventured to translate this passage, because a study of the rhythm leads me to suppose that some words are omitted. I believe that half a verse is lost.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_107"></a><a href="rp20306.htm#fr_107">21:4</a> I translate <i>shes ab</i> "activity" because the sense seems to require it. The translation is necessarily conjectural.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_108"></a><a href="rp20306.htm#fr_108">21:5</a> Translation doubtful.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_109"></a><a href="rp20306.htm#fr_109">22:1</a> Or "thy counsels."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_110"></a><a href="rp20306.htm#fr_110">22:2</a> Literally "Strike him on the mouth according to that which it is, such as it behaves itself, in consequence." It is probable that there is here a sort of play upon the words, and that the sense is "strike directly against a bad direction." The sequel seems to state that with disobedient subordinates it is necessary to give precise and positive orders without consideration.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_111"></a><a href="rp20306.htm#fr_111">22:3</a> Literally "throw, on account of the 'they act ill,' the order:"<i> Papyrus Prisse</i>, pl. viii.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_112"></a><a href="rp20306.htm#fr_112">22:4</a> Literally "the <i>usekh</i> is the place of that which he demands." The <i>usekh</i> was the hall in the centre of a building, and consequently protected from intruders. A "communication <i>usekh</i>" would accordingly be a secret communication.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_113"></a><a href="rp20306.htm#fr_113">22:5</a> Literally "the <i>larit</i>, the guardianship of the <i>larit</i>."</p>

 <p><a name="fn_143"></a><a href="rp20306.htm#fr_143">26:5</a> <i>Papyrus Prisse</i>, pl. xii.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_144"></a><a href="rp20306.htm#fr_144">27:1</a> I do not know whether this is the precise rendering, but the object of the chapter is clear. It is necessary to be moderate in everything; excess of work is to be avoided like excess of pleasure.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_145"></a><a href="rp20306.htm#fr_145">27:2</a> "Let not a great man be diverted from his hour."</p>

 <p><a name="fn_148"></a><a href="rp20306.htm#fr_148">27:5</a> Literally "teach the great man that one may honour him, that one may do him honour."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_149"></a><a href="rp20306.htm#fr_149">27:6</a> This probably means: if thou collectest the taxes in the provinces for the governor.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_150"></a><a href="rp20306.htm#fr_150">27:7</a> The word also signifies "offerings."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_151"></a><a href="rp20306.htm#fr_151">27:8</a> "With the consideration, thou lovest that it lives." The taxes levied by the government pay for the maintenance of its officers, who thereby maintain their position.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_161"></a><a href="rp20306.htm#fr_161">29:1</a> "In vexations a governor in quality of superior, one lives a time of distaste for him."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_162"></a><a href="rp20306.htm#fr_162">29:2</a> The text here seems faulty, some words being wanting as regards both rhythm and sense.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_163"></a><a href="rp20306.htm#fr_163">29:3</a> <i>Papyrus Prisse</i>, pl. xiv.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_164"></a><a href="rp20306.htm#fr_164">29:4</a> Literally "being one who knows that …"</p>
 <p><a name="fn_165"></a><a href="rp20306.htm#fr_165">29:5</a> Literally "in order that it may not be his turn not to come, [and] that one does not steal away to the profit of that same."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_166"></a><a href="rp20306.htm#fr_166">30:1</a> Literally "the loaves of communion," probably the part which each had to contribute from the crops. It is possible, however, that the reference is to distributions of food by the authorities; the malcontents would then be those who find that too little is given to them instead of contributors who think that too much is required from them. But I prefer the first explanation, since the verb an means "to bring" rather than "to carry away."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_167"></a><a href="rp20306.htm#fr_167">30:2</a> <i>Papyrus Prisse</i>, pl. xv.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_168"></a><a href="rp20306.htm#fr_168">30:3</a> "It is the making known the emptiness of his stomach."</p>

 <p><a name="fn_170"></a><a href="rp20306.htm#fr_170">30:5</a> "Being her contentment, she appreciates the work."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_171"></a><a href="rp20306.htm#fr_171">31:1</a> The author has concluded his exposition of the wisdom of the ancients. He now speaks in his own name, and while eulogising the doctrines he has repeated, notices with satisfaction the perfect form he has given to them to prevent them from being effaced from the memory of men and to preserve them from alteration. Their rhythmic form allows neither omissions nor variations.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_172"></a><a href="rp20306.htm#fr_172">31:2</a> That is to cause truth and justice to reign.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_173"></a><a href="rp20306.htm#fr_173">31:3</a> I do not think that a clearer statement can be found of the existence of a poetical language, rhythmically arranged, among the ancient Egyptians.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_174"></a><a href="rp20306.htm#fr_174">31:4</a> "The great will speak above; it is by explaining to a man the word." It therefore appears that the Precepts of Ptah-hotep were intended to be commented on by professors, and that there were schools of philosophy.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_175"></a><a href="rp20306.htm#fr_175">31:5</a> <i>Abuu</i>, "artist," or "master-workman." Perhaps something analogous to the degree of <i>magister artium</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_176"></a><a href="rp20306.htm#fr_176">31:6</a> "Being produced a good time by being at the head." The reference is possibly to a competitive examination among the students in order to obtain a public post.</p>
