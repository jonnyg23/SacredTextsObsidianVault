 <p>"This little volume is indispensable to the Bible reader who wishes to have in small compass an account of ancient manuscripts and early versions. It supplies a felt need."—<i>The Christian</i>.</p>  
 <p>"We have seldom met with a better written digest of the history of our English Bible. It might honestly have been presented to the public as a five-shilling volume."—<i>Sword and Trowel</i>.</p>  
 <p>"In these pages a flood of light is thrown on the sources of our English version, most valuable in answer to questions raised by the new revision."—<i>Word and Work</i>.</p>  
 <p>"This volume is partly historical, partly. bibliographical, and partly critical. Anybody can understand it, and everybody would be better for the thoughtful study of it."—<i>Christian Advocate</i>.</p>  
 <p>"Gives an excellent and comprehensive account for popular reading of the ancient manuscripts of the Bible."—<i>The Christian World</i>.</p>  
 <p>"It ought to find its way into our Training Colleges, Bible Classes, and Upper Classes in Schools."—<i>Ecclesiastical Gazette</i>.</p>  
 <p>"This little book deserves the attention of the large number of professing Christians who cannot devote the time to the larger histories of our English Bible."—<i>Presbyterian Churchman</i>.</p>  
 <p>"The book is a fine study of the history of the Bible, and should be read attentively and with profit."—<i>Publishers’ Circular</i>.</p>

 <p>It is not too much to say that this is a book that should be put into the hands, or better still, into the head of every Sunday School teacher and scholar. There is another excellent little book by the same author, "How we got our Bible," of which we may say the same thing.—<i>Oxford Journal</i>, April 5.</p>  
 <p><i>From</i> Right Hon. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">W. E. Gladstone</span>.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">I find the work itself most interesting. I have rarely seen the faculty of lucid exposition more conspicuously displayed.</div>  
 <p><i>From the Professor of Hebrew, Trinity College, Cambridge</i>.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">A very readable and attractive account of a subject on which I fear very general ignorance prevails.</div>  
 <p>A thoroughly excellent book is Mr. J. Paterson Smyth's <i>Old Documents and the New Bible</i>. … The history of the Bible is a subject on which nearly equal ignorance and curiosity prevail among the people, and Mr. Smyth's book meets a real want.—<i>Scottish Leader</i>, April 10.</p>  
 <p>…… It is a long time since we have come across a book which so thoroughly combined pleasure with profit as the volume now under description. It is small praise to say that there is not a dull page in it. Of the driest and most unpromising of materials he has constructed a book that anyone can understand, and that most readers will find to contain not only information but amusement. It is a perfect model of what such a book ought to be.—<i>The Bookseller</i>, April 5.</p>  
 <p>From Rev. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">W. Alexander</span>, D.D., Bishop of Derry.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Truly "The Old Documents and the New Bible" is <i>delightful</i> reading. It is pellucidly arranged and written, sometimes witty, sometimes pathetic in a high degree. A most instructive book.</div>  
 <p>It contains a first and easy, yet capital and most indispensable lesson in Biblical criticism, for the understanding of which no long and laborious preliminary studies are necessary. There is scholarship enough in it to make it exceedingly valuable to the young divinity student.—<i>Church Review</i>, May 2.</p>  
 <p>This little volume is an admirable piece of work by a writer who is evidently thoroughly master of his subject—<i>Glasgow Herald</i>, April 4.</p>  
 <p>From Rev. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Wm. Sanday</span>, <i>Professor of Exegesis, Exeter College, Oxford</i>.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Much impressed by the range of knowledge it displays, and by the vigour and clearness with which the subject is presented.</div>
