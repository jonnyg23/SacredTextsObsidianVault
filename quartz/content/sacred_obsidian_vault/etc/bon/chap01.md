   <p align="center">THE BOOK OF NOODLES.<br>
   CHAPTER I.<br>
    ANCIENT GRECIAN NOODLES.</p>
 
   <p>"<img border="0" src="images/image004.png" width="97" height="97" alt="O">LD as the days of Hierokles!" is the
   exclamation of the "classical" reader on hearing a well-worn jest; while, on the like occasion, that of the
   "genera " reader--a comprehensive term, which, doubtless, signifies one who knows "small Latin and
   less Greek"--is, that it is "a Joe Miller; "both implying that the critic is too deeply versed in
   <i>joke-ology</i> to be imposed upon, to have an old jest palmed on him as new, or as one made by a living wit. That
   the so-called jests of Hierokles are <i>old</i> there can be no doubt whatever; that they were collected by the
   Alexandrian sage of that name is more than doubtful; while it is certain that several of them are much older than the
   time in which he flourished, namely, the fifth century: it is very possible that some</p>
 
   <p><font color="#0000FF"><a name="p.2">p.2</a></font></p>
 
   <p>may date even as far back as the days of the ancient Egyptians! It is perhaps hardly necessary to say that honest
   Joseph Miller, the comedian, was not the compiler of the celebrated jest-book with which his name is associated; that
   it was, in fact, simply a bookseller's trick to entitle a heterogeneous collection of jokes, "quips, and
   cranks, and quiddities," <i>Joe Miller's Jests; or, The Wits Vade Mecum.</i> And when one speaks of a jest
   as being "a Joe Miller," he should only mean that it is "familiar as household words," not that
   it is of contemptible antiquity, albeit many of the jokes in "Joe Miller " are, at least, "as old as
   Hierokles," such, for instance, as that of the man who trained his horse to live on a straw <i>per diem,</i>
   when it suddenly died, or that of him who had a house to sell and carried about a brick as a specimen of it.</p>
 
   <p>The collection of facetiæ ascribed to Hierokles, by whomsoever it was made, is composed of very short anecdotes of
   the sayings and doings of pedants, who are represented as noodles, or simpletons. In their existing form they may not
   perhaps be of much earlier date than the ninth century. They seem to have come into the popular facetiæ of Europe
   through the churchmen of the Middle Ages, and, after having circulated</p>
 
   <p><a name="p.3"><font size="3" color="#0000FF">p.3</font></a></p>
 
   <p>long orally, passed into literature, whence, like other kinds of tales, they once more returned to the people. We
   find in them the indirect originals of some of the bulls and blunders which have in modern times been credited to
   Irishmen and Scotch Highlanders, and the germs also, perhaps, of some stories of the Gothamite type: as brave men
   lived before Agamemnon, so, too, the race of Gothamites can boast of a very ancient pedigree! By far the greater
   number of them, however, seem now pithless and pointless, whatever they may have been considered in ancient days,
   when, perhaps, folk found food for mirth in things which utterly fail to tickle our "sense of humour" in
   these double-distilled days. Of the <font face="Palatino Linotype">Ἀστεῖα</font>, or
   facetiæ, of Hierokles, twenty-eight only are appended to his Commentary on Pythagoras and the fragments of his other
   works edited, with Latin translations, by Needham, and published at Cambridge in 1709. A much larger collection,
   together with other Greek jests--of the people of Abdera, Sidonia, Cumæ, etc.-- has been edited by Eberhard, under
   the title of <i>Philogelos Hieraclis el Philagrii Facetiœ</i> which was published at Berlin in 1869.</p>
 
   <p>In attempting to classify the best of these relics of ancient wit--or witlessness, rather--it is often difficult
   to decide whether</p>
 
   <p><font color="#0000FF"><a name="p.4">p.<font size="3">4</font></a></font></p>
 
   <p>a particular jest is of the Hibernian bull, or blunder, genus or an example of that droll stupidity which is the
   characteristic of noodles or simpletons. In the latter class, however, one need not hesitate to place the story of
   the men of Cumæ, who were expecting shortly to be visited by a very eminent man, and having but one bath in the town,
   they filled it afresh, and placed an open grating in the middle, in order that half the water should be kept clean
   for his sole use.</p>
 
   <p>But we at once recognise our conventional Irishman in the pedant who, on going abroad, was asked by a friend to
   buy him two slave-boys of fifteen years each, and replied, "If I cannot find such a pair, I will bring you one
   of thirty years;" and in the fellow who was quarrelling with his father, and said to him, "Don't you
   know how much injury you have done me? Why, had you not been born, I should have inherited my grandfather's
   estate;" also in the pedant who heard that a raven lived two hundred years, and bought one that he should
   ascertain the fact for himself.</p>
 
   <p>Among Grecian Gothamites, again, was the hunter who was constantly disturbed by dreams of a boar pursuing him, and
   procured dogs to sleep with him. Another, surely, was the man of Cumæ who wished to sell some clothes he had stolen,
   and smeared them with</p>
 
   <p><a name="p.5"><font size="3" color="#0000FF">p.5</font></a></p>
 
   <p>pitch, so that they should not be recognised by the owner. They were Gothamites, too, those men of Abdera who
   punished a runaway ass for having got into the gymnasium and upset the olive oil. Having brought all the asses of the
   town together, as a caution, they flogged the delinquent ass before his fellows.</p>
 
   <p>Some of the jests of Hierokles may be considered either as witticisms or witless sayings of noodles; for example,
   the story of the man who recovered his health though the doctor had sworn he could not live, and afterwards, being
   asked by his friends why he seemed to avoid the doctor whenever they were both likely to meet, he replied, "He
   told me I should not live, and now I am ashamed to be alive;" or that of the pedant who said to the doctor,
   "Pardon me for not having been sick so long;" or this, "I dreamt that I saw and spoke to you last
   night:" quoth the other, "By the gods, I was so busy, I did not hear you."</p>
 
   <p>But our friend the Gothamite reappears in the pedant who saw some sparrows on a tree, and went quietly under it,
   stretched out his robe, and shook the tree, expecting to catch the sparrows as they fell, like ripe fruit again, in
   the pedant who lay down to sleep, and, finding he had no pillow, bade his servant place a jar under his head, after
   stuffing it</p>
 
   <p><a name="p.6"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#0000FF">p.6</font></a></p>
 
   <p><font face="Times New Roman">full of feathers to render it soft; again, in the cross-grained fellow who had some
   honey for sale, and a man coming up to him and inquiring the price, he upset the jar, and then replied, "You may
   shed my heart's blood like that before I tell such as you;" and again, in the man of Abdera who tried to
   hang himself, when the rope broke, and he hurt his head; but after having the wound dressed by the doctor, he went
   and accomplished his purpose. And we seem to have a trace of them in the story of the pedant who dreamt that a nail
   had pierced his foot, and in the morning he bound it up; when he told a friend of his mishap, he said, "Why do
   you sleep barefooted?"</font></p>
 
   <p>The following jest is spread--<i>mutatis mutandis</i>--over all Europe: A pedant, a bald man, and a barber, making
   a journey in company, agreed to watch in turn during the night. It was the barber's watch first. He propped up
   the sleeping pedant, and shaved his head, and when his time came, awoke him. When the pedant felt his head bare,
   "What a fool is this barber," he cried, "for he has roused the bald man instead of me!"</p>
 
   <p>A variant of this story is related of a raw Highlander, fresh from the heather, who put up at an inn in Perth, and
   shared his bed with a negro. Some coffee-room jokers hav-</p>
 
   <p><a name="p.7"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#0000FF">p.7</font></a></p>
 
   <p><font face="Times New Roman">ing blackened his face during the night, when he was called, as he had desired, very
   early next morning, and got up, he saw the reflection of his face in the mirror, and exclaimed in a rage, "Tuts,
   tuts! The silly body has waukened the wrang man."</font></p>
 
   <p>In connection with these two stories may be cited the following, from a Persian jest-book: A poor wrestler, who
   had passed all his life in forests, resolved to try his fortune in a great city, and as he drew near it he observed
   with wonder the crowds on the road, and thought, "I shall certainly not be able to know myself among so many
   people if I have not something about me that the others have not." So he tied a pumpkin to his right leg and,
   thus decorated, entered the town. A young wag, perceiving the simpleton, made friends with him, and induced him to
   spend the night at his house. While he was asleep, the joker removed the pumpkin from his leg and tied it to his own,
   and then lay down again. In the morning, when the poor fellow awoke and found the pumpkin on his companion's leg,
   he called to him, "Hey! get up, for I am perplexed in my mind. Who am I, and who are you? If I am myself, why is
   the pumpkin on your leg? And if you are yourself, why is the pumpkin not on my leg?" Modern counterparts of the
   following jest</p>
 
   <p><a name="p.8"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#0000FF">p.8</font></a></p>
 
   <p><font face="Times New Roman">are not far to seek: Quoth a man to a pedant, "The slave I bought of you has
   died." Rejoined the other, "By the gods, I do assure you that he never once played me such a trick while I
   had him." The old Greek pedant is transformed into an Irishman, in our collections of facetiæ, who applied to a
   farmer for work. "I'll have nothing to do with you," said the farmer, "for the last five Irishmen
   I had all died on my hands." Quoth Pat, "Sure, sir, I can bring you characters from half a dozen gentlemen
   I've worked for that I never did such a thing." And the jest is thus told in an old translation of <i>Les
   Contes Facetieux de Sieur Gaulard:</i> "Speaking of one of his Horses which broake his Neck at the descent of a
   Rock, he said, Truly it was one of the handsomest and best Curtails in all the Country; he neuer shewed me such a
   trick before in all his life."[1]</font></p>
 
   <p>Equally familiar is the jest of the pedant who was looking out for a place to prepare a tomb</p>
 
   <p><font color="#008000">[1] Etienne Tabourot, the author of this amusing little book, who was born at Dijon in 1549
   and died in 1590, is said to have written the tales in ridicule of the inhabitants of Franche Comte, who were then
   the subjects of Spain, and reputed to be stupid and illiterate. From a manuscript translation, entitled
   <i>Bizarrures; or, The Pleasant and Witlesse and Simple Speeches of the Lord Gaulard of Burgundy,</i> 
   purporting to be made by</font></p>
 
   <p><a name="p.9"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#0000FF">p.9</font></a></p>
 
   <p><font face="Times New Roman">for himself, and on a friend indicating what he thought to be a suitable spot,
   "Very true," said the pedant, "but it is unhealthy." And we have the prototype of a modern
   "Irish" story in the following: A pedant sealed a jar of wine, and his slaves perforated it below and drew
   off some of the liquor. He was astonished to find his wine disappear while the seal remained intact. A friend, to
   whom he had communicated the affair, advised him to look and ascertain if the liquor had not been drawn off from
   below. "Why, you fool," said he, "it is not the lower, but the upper, portion that is going
   off."</font></p>
 
   <p>It was a Greek pedant who stood before a mirror and shut his eyes that he might know how he looked when asleep--a
   jest which reappears in Taylor's <i>Wit and Mirth</i> in this form: "A wealthy monsieur in France (hauing
   profound reuenues and a shallow braine) was told by his man that he did continually gape</p>
 
   <p><font color="#008000">"J.B., of Charterhouse," probably about the year 
   1660, in the possession of Mr. Frederick William Cosens, London, fifty copies, 
   edited, with a preface, by "A.S." (Alexander Smith), were printed at Glasgow 
   in 1884. I am indebted to the courtesy of my friend Mr. F.T. Barrett, 
   Librarian of the Mitchell Library, Glasgow, for directing my attention to this 
   curious work, a copy of which is among the treasures of that already important 
   institution.</font></p>

   <p><font face="Times New Roman">in his sleepe, at which he was angry with his man, saying he would not belieue it.
   His man verified it to be true; his master said that he would neuer belieue any that told him so, except (quoth hee)
   I chance to see it with mine owne eyes; and therefore I will have a great Looking glasse at my bed's feet for the
   purpose to try whether thou art a lying knaue or not."[1]</font></p>
 
   <p>Not unlike some of our "Joe Millers" is the following: A citizen of Cumæ, on an ass, passed by an
   orchard, and seeing a branch of a fig-tree loaded with delicious fruit, he laid hold of it, but the ass went on,
   leaving him</p>
 
   <p><font color="#008000">[1] "<i>Wit and Mirth.</i> Chargeably collected out of Taverns, Ordinaries, Innes,
   Bowling-greenes and Allyes, Alehouses, Tobacco-shops, Highwayes, and Water-passages. Made up and fashioned into
   Clinches, Bulls, Quirkes, Yerkes, Quips, and Jerkes. Apothegmatically bundled vp and garbled at the request of John
   Garrett's Ghost." (1635)--such is the elaborate title of the collection of jests made by John Taylor, the
   Water Poet, which owes very little to preceding English jest-books. The above story had, however, been told
   previously in the <i>Bizarrures</i> of the Sieur Gaulard: "His cousine Dantressesa reproued him one day that she
   had found him sleeping in an ill posture with his mouth open, to order which for the tyme to come he commanded his
   seruant to hang a looking glasse upon the curtaine at his Bed's feet, that he might henceforth see if he had a
   good posture in his sleep."</font></p>

   <p><font face="Times New Roman">suspended. Just then the gardener came up and asked him what he did there. The man
   replied, "I fell off the ass."--An analogue to this drollery is found in an Indian story-book, entitled
   <i>Kath</i></font><i><font face="Times New Roman">á</font> <font face="Times New Roman">Manjarí:</font></i>
   <font face="Times New Roman">One day a thief climbed up a cocoa-nut tree in a garden to steal the fruit. The gardener
   heard the noise, and while he was running from his house, giving the alarm, the thief hastily descended from the
   tree. "Why were you up that tree?" asked the gardener. The thief replied, "My brother, I went up to
   gather grass for my calf." "Ha! ha! is there grass, then, on a cocoa-nut tree?" said the gardener.
   "No," quoth the thief; "but I did not know; therefore I came down again."--And we have a variant
   of this in the Turkish jest of the fellow who went into a garden and pulled up carrots, turnips, and other kinds of
   vegetables, some of which he put into a sack, and some into his bosom. The gardener, coming suddenly on the spot,
   laid hold of him, and said, "What are you seeking here?" The simpleton replied, "For some days past a
   great wind has been blowing, and that wind blew me hither." "But who pulled up these vegetables?"
   "As the wind blew very violently, it cast me here and there; and whatever I laid hold of in the hope of saving
   myself remained in my hands." "Ah," said the gardener,</font></p>
 
   <p><font color="#0000FF"><a name="p.12"><font size="3">p.</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">12</font></a></font></p>
 
   <p><font face="Times New Roman">"but who filled this sack with them?" "Well, that is the very question
   I was about to ask myself when you came up."</font></p>
 
   <p>The propensity with which Irishmen are credited of making ludicrous bulls is said to have its origin, not from any
   lack of intelligence, but rather in the fancy of that lively race, which often does not wait for expression until the
   ideas have taken proper verbal form. Be this as it may, a considerable portion of the bulls popularly ascribed to
   Irishmen are certainly "old as the jests of Hierokles," and are, moreover, current throughout Europe. Thus
   in Hierokles we read that one of twin-brothers having recently died, a pedant, meeting the survivor, asked him
   whether it was he or his brother who had deceased.--Taylor has this in his <i>Wit and Mirth,</i> and he probably
   heard it from some one who had read the facetious tales of the Sieur Gaulard: "A nobleman of France (as he was
   riding) met with a yeoman of the Country, to whom he said, My friend, I should know thee. I doe remember I haue often
   seene thee. My good Lord, said the countriman, I am one of your Honers poore tenants, and my name is T.J. I remember
   better now (said my Lord); there were two brothers of you, but one is dead; I pray, which of you doth remaine
   aliue?"--Mr. W. Carew Hazlitt, in the notes to his edition</p>
 
   <p><a name="p.13"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#0000FF">p.13</font></a></p>
 
   <p><font face="Times New Roman">of Taylor's collection (<i>Shakespeare Jest Books,</i> Third Series), cites a
   Scotch parallel from <i>The Laird of Logan:</i> "As the Paisley steamer came alongside the quay[1] at the city
   of the Seestus,[2] a denizen of St. Mirren's hailed one of the passengers: 'Jock! Jock! distu hear, man? Is
   that you or your brother?'" And to the same point is the old nursery rhyme,--</font></p>
 
   <blockquote>
     <p>"Ho, Master Teague, what is your story?<br>
      I went to the wood, and killed a tory;[3]<br>
      I went to the wood, and killed another:<br>
      "Was it the same, or was it his brother?"[4]</p>
   </blockquote>
 
   <p>We meet with a very old acquaintance in the pedant who lost a book and sought for it many days in vain, till one
   day he chanced to be eating lettuces, when, turning a corner, he saw it on the ground. Afterwards meeting a friend
   who was lamenting the loss of his girdle, he said to him, "Don't grieve; buy some lettuces; eat them at a
   corner; turn</p>
 
   <p><font color="#008000">[1] Only a Liliputian steamer could go up the "river" Cart!</font></p>
 
   <p><font color="#008000">[2] "Seestu" is a nickname for Paisley, the good folks of that busy town being in
   the habit of frequently interjecting, "Seestu?"--<i>i.e.,</i> "Seest thou? "--in their familiar
   colloquies.</font></p>
 
   <p><font color="#008000">[3] "Tory" is said to be the Erse term for a robber.</font></p>

   <p><font face="Times New Roman">round it, go a little way on, and you will find your girdle." But is there
   anything like this in "Joe Miller"?--Two lazy fellows were sleeping together, when a thief came, and
   drawing down the coverlet made off with it. One of them was aware of the theft, and said to the other, "Get up,
   and run after the man that has stolen our coverlet." "You blockhead," replied his companion,
   "wait till he comes back to steal the bolster, and we two will master him." And has "Joe" got
   this one?--A pedant's little boy having died, many friends came to the funeral, on seeing whom he said, "I
   am ashamed to bring out so small a boy to so great a crowd."</font></p>
 
   <p>An epigram in the <i>Anthologia</i> may find a place among noodle stories:</p>
 
   <blockquote>
     <p>"A blockhead, bit by fleas, put out the light,<br>
      And, chuckling, cried, 'Now you can't see to<br>
      bite!'"</p>
   </blockquote>
 
   <p>This ancient jest has been somewhat improved in later times. Two Irishmen in the East Indies, being sorely
   pestered with mosquitoes, kept their light burning in hopes of scaring them off, but finding this did not answer, one
   suggested they should extinguish the light and thus puzzle their tormentors to find them, which was done. Presently
   the other, observing the light of a firefly in the</p>
 
   <p><a name="p.15"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#0000FF">p.15</font></a></p>
 
   <p><font face="Times New Roman">room, called to his bedfellow, "Arrah, Mike, sure your plan's no good, for,
   bedad, here's one of them looking for us wid a lantern!"</font></p>
 
   <p>Our specimens may be now concluded with what is probably the best of the old Greek jokes. The father of a man of
   Cumæ having died at Alexandria, the son dutifully took the body to the embalmers. When he returned at the appointed
   time to fetch it away, there happened to be a number of bodies in the same place, so he was asked if his father had
   any peculiarity by which his body might be recognised, and the wittol replied, "He had a cough."</p>
