 <h1 align="CENTER">XVII. THE HORSE-SHOE AS A SYMBOL ON TAVERN SIGN-BOARDS</h1>
 <p>The horse-shoe, associated usually with some other symbol, is not infrequently seen displayed on the signs of British taverns. There is a well-known hostelry bearing this sign and name on Tottenham Court Road in London. To quote from "The History of Signboards," by Jacob Larwood and John Camden Hot ten:--</p>
 <p>The Three Horse-shoes are not uncommon, and the single shoe may be met with in many combinations, arising from the old belief in its lucky influences. Thus the Horse and Horse-Shoe was the sign of William Warden at Dover, as appears from his token. The Sun and Horse-Shoe is still a public-house sign in Great Tichfield Street, and the Magpie and Horse-Shoe may be seen carved in Fetter Lane; the magpie is perched within the horse-shoe, a bunch of grapes being suspended from it. The Horns and Horse-shoe is represented on the token of William Grainge, in Gutter Lane, 1666, a horse-shoe within a pair of antlers. The Hoop and Horseshoe on Tower Hill was formerly called the Horse-shoe.</p>
 <p>Miller Christy, in his book "The Trade Signs of Essex," says that horse-shoe signs probably owe their origin partly to the fact that this symbol appears on the arms of the Farriers' Company, and partly to the old practice of fastening a horse-shoe upon the stable-door or elsewhere as a witch-scarer. In the county of Essex the horse-shoe may be seen upon the signs of beerhouses at Great Parndon, Braintree, Waltham Abbey, and High Ongar.</p>
 <p>There was formerly more than one noted inn in London known as the Half-Moon, and a street of that name, leading from Piccadilly, is well known. The name and symbol of the full moon, however, seldom appear on sign-boards. Butler asks in "Hudibras:"--</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Tell me, but what's the nat'ral cause,<br>
 Why on a sign no painter draws<br>
 The full moon, but the half?</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>The reason is doubtless because of the favorable auspices associated from time immemorial with the crescent moon.</p>
 <p>One need hardly accept as plausible the explanation sometimes offered, namely, that the half-moon tavern symbol is a silent invitation to eat and drink to one's full capacity; a hint, as it were, to follow the crescent moon's example and "get full."</p>
