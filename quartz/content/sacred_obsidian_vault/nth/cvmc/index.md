 <i>And with all the [world crises] going on today, it's no wonder that
 a lot of people are beginning to feel like a Christian Scientist
 with appendicitis</i>--Tom Leher, <i>That Was The Year That Was</i>
 </dir>
 <p>
 A lot of the theories floated by progressive thinkers at the turn of the 20th
 century have today been consigned to the dust bin of history.
 Some have, however, entered the mainstream.
 For instance, the 'Mind Cure,' essentially New Thought/Christian Science
 without the mystical and religious entanglements, is not so far off
 from what is now termed mind-body
 medicine.
 This long-out-of-print book is a succinct and very
 clearly written exposition of the Mind Cure.
 The Mind Cure acknowledges the active role that the patient's mental
 state can take in resolving health problems, while not disregarding
 orthodox western medicine.
 Much of the advice in this book would today probably be
 regarded by many medical professionals as sensible,
 and at the very least, not harmful.
 Nonetheless, please observe the caveat in the
 site <a href="../../tos.htm">terms of service</a> about 'medical advice,'
 and consult with a doctor before using any of the treatments in this text.

 Another progressive reform used in this book, 'simplified spelling'
 (e.g. <i>tho,</i> <i>fixt,</i> <i>possest</i>) has not fared as well in the interim.
 As usual, I have left original spelling intact except where it is
 an actual typographical error, in which case it is corrected and
 linked to the <a href="errata.htm">errata page</a>.
