 <p></p>  <h3 align="center">HEALTH</h3>  
 <p>When man is harmonious and happy he is healthy! All sickness comes from sin or violation of Spiritual Law.</p>  
 <p>Jesus Christ said: "Be thou healed, your sins are forgiven."</p>  
 <p>Resentment, ill-will, hate, fear, etc., etc., tear down the cells of the body and poison the blood. (See <i>The Game of Life and How to Play It</i>.)</p>  
 <p>Accidents, old age and death itself, come from holding wrong mental pictures.</p>  
 <p>When man sees himself as God sees him, he will become a radiant being, timeless, birthless and deathless, for "God made man in His likeness and in His image." </p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  <h4 align="center">AFFIRMATIONS</h4>  
 <p>I deny fatigue, for there is nothing to tire me. I live in the Kingdom of eternal joy and absorbing interests.</p>  
 <p>My body is "the body electric," timeless and tireless, birthless and deathless.</p>  
 <p>Time and space are obliterated!</p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>I live in the wonderful now, birthless and deathless!</p>  
 <p>I am one with <i>The One!</i> </p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>Thou in me art:</p>  
 <p></p><dir>Eternal joy.<br> Eternal youth.<br> Eternal wealth.<br> Eternal health.<br> Eternal love.<br> Eternal life.</dir>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>I am a Spiritual Beingmy body is perfect, made in His likeness and image.</p>  
 <p>The Light of the Christ now streams through every cell. I give thanks for my radiant health.</p>
