 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Your Word is Your Wand</i>, by Florence Scovel Shinn, [1928], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  
 <p></p>  <h3 align="center">PROSPERITY</h3>  
 <p align="center">(See also <i>The Game of Life and How to Play I</i>t.)</p>  
 <p>Man comes into the world financed by God, with all that he desires or requires already on his pathway.</p>  
 <p>This supply is released through faith and the <i>Spoken Word</i>.</p>  
 <p>"If thou canst believe, all things are possible."</p>  
 <p>For example: A woman came to me one day, to tell me of her experience in using an affirmation she had read in my book, <i>The Game of Life and How to Play It</i>.</p>  
 <p>She was without experience but desired a good position on the stage. She took the affirmation: "Infinite Spirit, open the way for my great abundance. I am an irresistible magnet for all that belongs to me by Divine Right."</p>  
 <p>She was given a very important part in a successful opera.</p>  
 <p>She said: "It was a miracle, due to that affirmation, which I repeated hundreds of times." </p>  <h4 align="center">AFFIRMATIONS</h4>  
 <p>I now draw from the abundance of the spheres my immediate and endless supply.</p>  
 <p>All channels are free!</p>  
 <p>All doors are open!</p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>I now release the gold-mine within me. I am linked with an endless golden stream of prosperity which comes to me under grace in perfect ways.</p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>Goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I shall dwell in the house of abundance forever.</p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>My God is a God of plenty and I now receive all that I desire or require, and more.</p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>All that is mine by Divine Right is now released and reaches me in great avalanches of abundance, under grace in miraculous ways.</p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>My supply is endless, inexhaustible and immediate and comes to me under grace in perfect ways. </p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>All channels are free and all doors fly open for my immediate and endless, Divinely Designed supply.</p>  
 <p>My ships come in over a calm sea, under grace in perfect ways.</p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>I give thanks that the millions which are mine by Divine Right, now pour in and pile up under grace in perfect ways.</p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>Unexpected doors fly open, unexpected channels are free, and endless avalanches of abundance are poured out upon me, under grace in perfect ways.</p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>I spend money under direct inspiration wisely and fearlessly, knowing my supply is endless and immediate.</p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>I am fearless in letting money go out, knowing God is my immediate and endless supply.</p>
