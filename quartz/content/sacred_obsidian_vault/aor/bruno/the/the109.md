 <p>O LOVELY, graceful nymphs of England!<br> Not in repugnance nor in scorn,<br> Our spirit holds you, Nor would our pen abase you<br> More than it must--to call you feminine!<br> Exemption I am sure you would not claim<br> Being subject to the common influence;<br> Shining on earth as do the stars in heaven.<br> Your sov'reign beauty, ladies, our austerity<br> Cannot depreciate, nor would do so,<br> For we have not in view a superhuman kind.<br> Such poison, <a name="fr_7"></a><a href="#fn_7"><font size="1">1</font></a> therefore, far from you be set,<br> For here we see the one, the great Diana,<br> Who is to you as sun amongst the stars.<br> Wit, words, learning and art,<br> And whatsoe'er is mine of scribbling faculty,<br> I humbly place before you.</p>
