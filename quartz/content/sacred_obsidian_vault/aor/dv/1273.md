 Some flames had already lasted in the furnace of a glass-blower,
 when they saw a candle approaching in a beautiful and glittering
 candlestick. With ardent longing they strove to reach it; and one of
 them, quitting its natural course, writhed up to an unburnt brand on
 which it fed and passed at the opposite end out by a narrow chink to
 the candle which was near. It flung itself upon it, and with fierce
 jealousy and greediness it devoured it, having reduced it almost to
 death, and, wishing to procure the prolongation of its life, it
 tried to return to the furnace whence it had come. But in vain, for
 it was compelled to die, the wood perishing together with the
 candle, being at last converted, with lamentation and repentance,
 into foul smoke, while leaving all its sisters in brilliant and
 enduring life and beauty.
