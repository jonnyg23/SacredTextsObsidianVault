 <p>
 An object of equal breadth and colour throughout, seen against a
 background of various colours will appear unequal in breadth.
 </p><p>
 And if an object of equal breadth throughout, but of various
 colours, is seen against a background of uniform colour, that object
 will appear of various breadth. And the more the colours of the
 background or of the object seen against the ground vary, the
 greater will the apparent variations in the breadth be though the
 objects seen against the ground be of equal breadth [throughout].
