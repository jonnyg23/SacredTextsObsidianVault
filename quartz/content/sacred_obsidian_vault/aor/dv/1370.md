 <p><a name="fn_391"></a><a href="1370.htm#fr_391">415:697</a> : While the letters in the MS. notes of 1473 and 1478 are
 very ornate, this note and the texts on anatomy on the same sheet
 (for instance No. 805) are in the same simple hand as we see on
 <a href="pl116.htm#img_pl116">Pl. CXVI</a> and CXIX. No 1370 is the only dated note of the years between
 1480 and 1489, and the characters are in all essential points
 identical with those that we see in the latest manuscripts written
 in France (compare the facsimiles on <a href="pl115.htm#img_pl115">Pl. CXV</a> and p. 254), so that it
 is hardly possible to determine exactly the date of a manuscript
 from the style of the handwriting, if it does not betray the
 peculiarities of style as displayed in the few notes dated previous
 to l480.--Compare the facsimile of the manuscripts 1479 on <a href="dv20958.htm#img_pl062">Pl. LXII</a>,
 No. 2; No. 664, note, Vol. I p. 346. This shows already a marked
 simplicity as compared with the calligraphy of 1478.
 </p><p>
 The text No. 720 belongs to the year 1490; No. 1510 to the year
 1492; No. 1459, No. 1384 and No. 1460 to the year 1493; No. 1463,
 No. 1517, No. 1024, 1025 and 1461 to the year 1494; Nos. 1523 and
