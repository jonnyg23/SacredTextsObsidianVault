 </p><h3 align="CENTER">FOR MAKING A CLEAN STABLE.</h3>
 <p>
 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> On the dispositions of a stable.</font></span>The manner in which one must arrange a stable. You must first divide
 its width in 3 parts, its depth matters not; and let these 3
 divisions be equal and 6 braccia broad for each part and 10 high,
 and the middle part shall be for the use of the stablemasters; the 2
 side ones for the horses, each of which must be 6 braccia in width
 and 6 in length, and be half a braccio higher at the head than
 behind. Let the manger be at 2 braccia from the ground, to the
 bottom of the rack, 3 braccia, and the top of it 4 braccia. Now, in
 order to attain to what I promise, that is to make this place,
 contrary to the general custom, clean and neat: as to the upper part
 of the stable, i. e. where the hay is, that part must have at its
 outer end a window 6 braccia high and 6 broad, through which by
 simple means the hay is brought up to the loft, as is shown by the
 machine <i>E</i>; and let this be erected in a place 6 braccia wide, and
 as long as the stable, as seen at <i>k p</i>. The other two parts, which
 are on either side of this, are again divided; those nearest to the
 hay-loft are 4 braccia, <i>p s</i>, and only for the use and circulation
 of the servants belonging to the stable; the other two which reach
 to the outer walls are 2 braccia, as seen at <i>s k</i>, and these are
 made for the purpose of giving hay to the mangers, by means of
 funnels, narrow at the top and wide over the manger, in order that
 the hay should not choke them. They must be well plastered and clean
 and are represented at 4 <i>f s</i>. As to the giving the horses water,
 the troughs must be of stone and above them [cisterns of] water. The
 mangers may be opened as boxes are uncovered by raising the lids.
