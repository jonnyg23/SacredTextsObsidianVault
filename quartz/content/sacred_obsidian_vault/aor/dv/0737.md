 </p><h3 align="CENTER">HOW CASTS OUGHT TO BE POLISHED.</h3>
 <p>
 Make a bunch of iron wire as thick as thread, and scrub them with
 [this and] water; hold a bowl underneath that it may not make a mud
 below.
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">HOW TO REMOVE THE ROUGH EDGES FROM BRONZE.</h3>
 <p>
 Make an iron rod, after the manner of a large chisel, and with this
 rub over those seams on the bronze which remain on the casts of the
 guns, and which are caused by the joins in the mould; but make the
 tool heavy enough, and let the strokes be long and broad.
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">TO FACILITATE MELTING.</h3>
 <p>
 First alloy part of the metal in the crucible, then put it in the
 furnace, and this being in a molten state will assist in beginning
 to melt the copper.
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">TO PREVENT THE COPPER COOLING IN THE FURNACE.</h3>
 <p>
 When the copper cools in the furnace, be ready, as soon as you
 perceive it, to cut it with a long stick while it is still in a
 paste; or if it is quite cold cut it as lead is cut with broad and
 large chisels.

 </p><h3 align="CENTER">IF YOU HAVE TO MAKE A LARGE CAST.</h3>
 <p>
 If you have to make a cast of a hundred thousand pounds do it with
 two furnaces and with 2000 pounds in each, or as much as 3000 pounds
 at most.
