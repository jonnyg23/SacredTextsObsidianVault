 </p><h3 align="CENTER">HOW THE MIRROR IS THE MASTER [AND GUIDE] OF PAINTERS.</h3>
 <p>
 When you want to see if your picture corresponds throughout with the
 objects you have drawn from nature, take a mirror and look in that
 at the reflection of the real things, and compare the reflected
 image with your picture, and consider whether the subject of the two
 images duly corresponds in both, particularly studying the mirror.
 You should take the mirror for your guide--that is to say a flat
 mirror--because on its surface the objects appear in many respects
 as in a painting. Thus you see, in a painting done on a flat
 surface, objects which appear in relief, and in the mirror--also a
 flat surface--they look the same. The picture has one plane surface
 and the same with the mirror. The picture is intangible, in so far
 as that which appears round and prominent

 <p>cannot be grasped in the
 hands; and it is the same with the mirror. And since you can see
 that the mirror, by means of outlines, shadows and lights, makes
 objects appear in relief, you, who have in your colours far stronger
 lights and shades than those in the mirror, can certainly, if you
 compose your picture well, make that also look like a natural scene
 reflected in a large mirror.

 <p><a name="fn_256"></a><a href="0529.htm#fr_256">265:254</a> : I understand the concluding lines of this passage as
 follows: If you draw the upper half a figure on a large sheet of
 paper laid out on the floor of a room (<i>sala be piana</i>) to the same
 scale (<i>con le sue vere grosseze</i>) as the lower half, already drawn
 upon the wall (lines 10, 11)you must then reduce them on a '<i>pariete
 di rilievo</i>,' a curved vertical plane which serves as a model to
 reproduce the form of the vault.</p>
