 If a man 2 braccia high is too small, one of four is too tall, the
 medium being what is admirable. Between 2 and 4 comes 3; therefore
 take a man of 3 braccia in height and measure him by the rule I will
 give you. If you tell me that I may be mistaken, and judge a man to
 be well proportioned who does not conform to this division, I answer
 that you must look at many men of 3 braccia, and out of the larger
 number who are alike in their limbs choose one of those who are most
 graceful and take your measurements. The length of the hand is 1/3
 of a braccio [8 inches] and this is found 9 times in man. And the
 face  <a name="fr_134"></a><a href="#fn_134"><font size="1">132</font></a>
  is the same, and from
 the pit of the throat to the shoulder, and from the shoulder to the
 nipple, and from one nipple to the other, and from each nipple to
 the pit of the throat.
