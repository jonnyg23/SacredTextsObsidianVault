 </p><h3 align="CENTER">PEACE.</h3>
 <p>
 We read of the beaver that when it is pursued, knowing that it is
 for the virtue [contained] in its medicinal testicles and not being
 able to escape, it stops; and to be at peace with its pursuers, it
 bites off its testicles with its sharp teeth, and leaves them to its
 enemies.
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">RAGE.</h3>
 <p>
 It is said of the bear that when it goes to the haunts of bees to
 take their honey, the bees having begun to sting him he leaves the
 honey and rushes to revenge himself. And as he seeks to be revenged
 on all those that sting him, he is revenged on none; in such wise
 that his rage is turned to madness, and he flings himself on the
 ground, vainly exasperating, by his hands and feet, the foes against
 which he is defending himself.
