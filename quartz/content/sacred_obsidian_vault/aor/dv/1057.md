 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> The Alps (1057-1062).</font></span>At Monbracco, above Saluzzo,--a mile above the Certosa, at the foot
 of Monte Viso, there is a quarry of flakey stone, which is as white
 as Carrara marble, without a spot, and as hard as porphyry or even
 harder; of which my worthy gossip, Master Benedetto the sculptor,
 has promised to give me a small slab, for the colours, the second
 day of January 1511.

 <p><a name="fn_242"></a><a href="1057.htm#fr_242">245:576</a>  9. 10.: <i>Maestro Benedetto scultore</i>; probably some native
 of Northern Italy acquainted with the place here described. Hardly
 the Florentine sculptor Benedetto da Majano. Amoretti had published
 this passage, and M. Ravaisson who gave a French translation of it
 in the <i>Gazette des Beaux Arts</i> (1881, pag. 528), remarks as
 follows: <i>Le maitre sculpteur que Leonard appelle son "compare" ne
 serait-il pas Benedetto da Majano, un de ceux qui jugerent avec lui
 de la place a donner au David de Michel-Ange, et de qui le Louvre a
 acquis recemment un buste d'apres Philippe Strozzi?</i> To this it may
 be objected that Benedetto da Majano had already lain in his grave
 fourteen years, in the year 1511, when he is supposed to have given
 the promise to Leonardo. The colours may have been given to the
 sculptor Benedetto and the stone may have been in payment for them.
 &gt;From the description of the stone here given we may conclude that it
 is repeated from hearsay of the sculptor's account of it. I do not
 understand how, from this observation, it is possible to conclude
 that Leonardo was on the spot.</p>
