 <p>
 If you wish to draw a figure or any other object to look 24 braccia
 high you must do it in this way. First, on the surface <i>m r</i> draw
 half the man you wish to represent; then the other half; then put on
 the vault <i>m n</i> [the rest of] the figure spoken of above; first set
 out the vertical plane on the floor of a room of the same shape as
 the wall with the coved part on which you are to paint your figure.
 Then, behind it, draw a figure set out in profile of whatever size
 you please, and draw lines from it to the point <i>f</i> and, as these
 lines cut <i>m n</i> on the vertical plane, so will the figure come on
 the wall, of which the vertical plane gives a likeness, and you will
 have all the [relative] heights and prominences of the figure. And
 the breadth or thickness which are on the upright wall <i>m n</i> are to
 be drawn in their proper form, since, as the wall recedes the figure
 will be foreshortened by itself; but [that part of] the figure which
 goes into the cove you must foreshorten, as if it were standing
 upright; this diminution you must set out on a flat floor and there
 must stand the figure which is to be transferred from the vertical
 plane <i>r n</i> <a name="fr_253"></a><a href="#fn_253"><font size="1">251</font></a>
  in its real
 size and reduce it once more on a vertical plane; and this will be a
 good method  <a name="fr_254"></a><a href="#fn_254"><font size="1">252</font></a>
 .

 <p><a name="fn_253"></a><a href="0526.htm#fr_253">263:251</a>  17: <i>che leverai dalla pariete r n</i>. The
 letters refer to the larger sketch, No. 3 on <a href="pl031.htm#img_pl031">Pl. XXXI</a>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_254"></a><a href="0526.htm#fr_254">263:252</a>  18: Leonardo here says nothing as to how the
 image foreshortened by perspective and thus produced on the vertical
 plane is to be transferred to the wall; but from what is said in
 Nos. 525 and 523 we may conclude that he was familiar with the
 process of casting the enlarged shadow of a squaring net on the
 surface of a wall to guide him in drawing the figure.

 <i>Pariete di rilieuo; "sur une parai en relief"</i> (RAVAISSON). <i>"Auf
 einer Schnittlinie zum Aufrichten"</i> (LUDWIG). The explanation of
 this puzzling expression must be sought in No. 545, lines 15-17.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_255"></a><a href="0526.htm#fr_255">263:253</a> : See <a href="pl031.htm#img_pl031">Pl. XXXI</a>. 3. The second sketch, which in the plate is
 incomplete, is here reproduced and completed from the original to
 illustrate the text. In the original the larger diagram is placed
 between lines 5 and 6.

 1. 2. C. A. 157a; 463a has the similar heading: '<i>del cressciere
 della figura</i>', and the text begins: "<i>Se voli fare 1a figura
 grande</i> b c" but here it breaks off. The translation here given
 renders the meaning of the passage as I think it must be understood.
 The MS. is perfectly legible and the construction of the sentence is
 simple and clear; difficulties can only arise from the very fullness
 of the meaning, particularly towards the end of the passage.</p>
