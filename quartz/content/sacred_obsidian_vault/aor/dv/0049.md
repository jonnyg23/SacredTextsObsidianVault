 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> The nature of the outline.</font></span>The boundaries of bodies are the least of all things. The
 proposition is proved to be true, because the boundary of a thing is
 a surface, which is not part of the body contained within that
 surface; nor is it part of the air surrounding that body, but is the
 medium interposted between the air and the body, as is proved in its
 place. But the lateral boundaries of these bodies is the line
 forming the boundary of the surface, which line is of invisible
 thickness. Wherefore O painter! do not surround your bodies with
 lines, and above all when representing objects smaller than nature;
 for not only will their external outlines become indistinct, but
 their parts will be invisible from distance.
