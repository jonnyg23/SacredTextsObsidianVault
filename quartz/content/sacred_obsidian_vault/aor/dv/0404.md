 The tips of the boughs of plants [and trees], unless they are borne
 down by the weight of their fruits, turn towards the sky as much as
 possible.
 </p><p>
 The upper side of their leaves is turned towards the sky that it may
 receive the nourishment of the dew which falls at night.
 </p><p>
 The sun gives spirit and life to plants and the earth nourishes them
 with moisture. [9] With regard to this I made the experiment of
 leaving only one small root on a gourd and this I kept nourished
 with water, and the gourd brought to perfection all the fruits it
 could produce, which were about 60 gourds of the long kind, andi set
 my mind diligently [to consider] this vitality and perceived that
 the dews of night were what supplied it abundantly with moisture
 through the insertion of its large leaves and gave nourishment to
 the plant and its offspring--or the seeds which its offspring had
 to produce--[21].
 </p><p>
 The rule of the leaves produced on the last shoot of the year will
 be that they will grow in a contrary direction on the twin branches;
 that is, that the insertion of the leaves turns round each branch in
 such a

 <p>way, as that the sixth leaf above is produced over the sixth
 leaf below, and the way they turn is that if one turns towards its
 companion to the right, the other turns to the left, the leaf
 serving as the nourishing breast for the shoot or fruit which grows
 the following year.
