 The clouds do not show their rounded forms excepting on the sides
 which face the sun; on the others the roundness is imperceptible
 because they are in the shade.  <a name="fr_233"></a><a href="#fn_233"><font size="1">231</font></a>

 If the sun is in the East and the clouds in the West, the eye placed
 between the sun and the clouds sees the edges of the rounded forms
 composing these clouds as dark, and the portions which are
 surrounded by this dark [edge] are light. And this occurs because
 the edges of the rounded forms of these clouds are turned towards
 the upper or lateral sky, which is reflected in them.

 Both the cloud and the tree display no roundness at all on their
 shaded side.
