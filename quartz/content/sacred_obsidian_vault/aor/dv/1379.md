 <p><a name="fn_400"></a><a href="1379.htm#fr_400">421:706</a>  2: <i>Libro di
 Vitolone</i> see No. 1506 note.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_401"></a><a href="1379.htm#fr_401">421:707</a> : 7 and fol. It would seem from the text that Leonardo
 intended to have instructions in painting on paper. It is hardly
 necessary to point out that the Art of illuminating was quite
 separate from that of painting.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_402"></a><a href="1379.htm#fr_402">421:708</a> : The mysterious looking words, quite
 distinctly written, in line 1: <i>ingol, amor a, ilopan a</i> and
 on line 2: <i>enoiganod al</i> are obviously in cipher and the solution
 is a simple one; by reading them backwards we find for <i>ingol</i>: logni-probably <i>longi</i>,
 evidently the name of a person; for <i>amor a</i>: <i>a Roma</i>, for <i>ilopan
 a</i>: <i>a Napoli</i>. Leonardo has done the same in two passages treating
 on some secrets of his art Nos. 641 and 729, the only other places
 in which we find this cipher employed; we may therefore conclude
 that it was for the sake of secrecy that he used it.
 </p><p>
 There can be no doubt, from the tenor of this passage, that Leonardo
 projected a secret excursion to Naples. Nothing has hitherto been
 known of this journey, but the significance of the passage will be
 easily understood by a reference to the following notes, from which
 we may infer that Leonardo really had at the time plans for
 travelling further than Naples. From lines 3, 4 and 7 it is evident
 that he purposed, after selling every thing that was not easily
 portable, to leave a chest in the care of his relations at Vinci.
 His luggage was to be packed into two trunks especially adapted for
 transport by mules. The exact meaning of many sentences in the
 following notes must necessarily remain obscure. These brief remarks
 on small and irrelevant affairs and so forth are however of no
 historical value. The notes referring to the preparations for his
 journey are more intelligible.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_403"></a><a href="1379.htm#fr_403">422:709</a>  11. 'De Ponderibus'. A large number of Leonardo's
 notes bear this superscription. Compare No. 1436, 3.</p>
