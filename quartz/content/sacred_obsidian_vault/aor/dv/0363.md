 O Anatomical Painter! beware lest the too strong indication of the
 bones, sinews and muscles, be the cause of your becoming wooden in
 your painting by your wish to make your nude figures display all
 their feeling. Therefore, in endeavouring to remedy this, look in
 what manner the muscles clothe or cover their bones in old or lean
 persons; and besides this, observe the rule as to how these same
 muscles fill up the spaces of the surface that extend between them,
 which are the muscles which never lose their prominence in any
 amount of fatness; and which too are the muscles of which the
 attachments are lost to sight in the very least plumpness. And in
 many cases several muscles look like one single muscle in the
 increase of fat; and in many cases, in growing lean or old, one
 single muscle divides into several muscles. And in this treatise,
 each in its place, all their peculiarities will be explained--and
 particularly as to the spaces between the joints of each limb &amp;c

 <p>Again, do not fail [to observe] the variations in the forms of the
 above mentioned muscles, round and about the joints of the limbs of
 any animal, as caused by the diversity of the motions of each limb;
 for on some side of those joints the prominence of these muscles is
 wholly lost in the increase or diminution of the flesh of which
 these muscles are composed, &amp;c

 <p><a name="fn_180"></a><a href="0363.htm#fr_180">191:178</a> : DE ROSSI remarks on this chapter, in the Roman edition of
 the Trattato, p. 504: "<i>Non in questo luogo solo, ma in altri ancora
 osserverà il lettore, che Lionardo va fungendo quelli che fanno
 abuso della loro dottrina anatomica, e sicuramente con ciò ha in
 mira il suo rivale Bonarroti, che di anatomia facea tanta pompa</i>."
 Note, that Leonardo wrote this passage in Rome, probably under the
 immediate impression of MICHAELANGELO'S paintings in the Sistine
 Chapel and of RAPHAEL'S Isaiah in Sant' Agostino.</p>
