 <p>
 The lover is moved by the beloved object as the senses are by
 sensible objects; and they unite and become one and the same thing.
 The work is the first thing born of this union; if the thing loved
 is base the lover becomes base.
 </p><p>
 When the thing taken into union is perfectly adapted to that which
 receives it, the result is delight and pleasure and satisfaction.
 </p><p>
 When that which loves is united to the thing beloved it can rest
 there; when the burden is laid down it finds rest there.
