 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF A MIXTURE OF NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL PERSPECTIVE.</h3>
 <p>
 This diagram distinguishes natural from artificial perspective. But
 before proceeding any farther I will define what is natural and what
 is artificial perspective. Natural perspective says that the more
 remote of a series of
 </p><p align="CENTER"><a name="img_v106400"></a>
 <img src="img/v106400.jpg"></p>
 <p>objects of equal size will look the smaller,
 and conversely, the nearer will look the larger and the apparent
 size will diminish in proportion to the distance. But in artificial
 perspective when objects of unequal size are placed at various
 distances, the smallest is nearer to the eye than the largest and
 the greatest distance looks as though it were the least of all; and
 the cause of this is the plane on which the objects are represented;
 and which is at unequal distances from the eye throughout its
 length. And this diminution
 </p><p><a name="page_65"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 65</font></a></p>
 <p>of the plane is natural, but the
 perspective shown upon it is artificial since it nowhere agrees with
 the true diminution of the said plane. Whence it follows, that when
 the eye is somewhat removed from the [station point of the]
 perspective that it has been gazing at, all the objects represented
 look monstrous, and this does not occur in natural perspective,
 which has been defined above. Let us say then, that the square <i>a b
 c d</i> figured above is foreshortened being seen by the eye situated
 in the centre of the side which is in front. But a mixture of
 artificial and natural perspective will be seen in this tetragon
 called <i>el main</i>  <a name="fr_54"></a><a href="#fn_54"><font size="1">52</font></a>
 , that is to say <i>e f g h</i> which must appear to the eye of
 the spectator to be equal to <i>a b c d</i> so long as the eye remains in
 its first position between <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>. And this will be seen to
 have a good effect, because the natural perspective of the plane
 will conceal the defects which would [otherwise] seem monstrous.

 the original; the meaning and derivation of the word are equally
 doubtful.</p>
