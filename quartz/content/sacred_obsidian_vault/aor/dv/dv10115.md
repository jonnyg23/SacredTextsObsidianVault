 <i>Linear Perspective cannot be immediately followed by either the</i>
 "prospettiva de' perdimenti" <i>or the</i> "prospettiva de' colori" <i>or
 the aerial perspective; since these branches of the subject
 presuppose a knowledge of the principles of Light and Shade. No
 apology, therefore, is here needed for placing these immediately
 after Linear Perspective.</i>

 <i>We have various plans suggested by Leonardo for the arrangement of
 the mass of materials treating of this subject. Among these I have
 given the preference to a scheme propounded in No.</i> III, <i>because,
 in all probability, we have here a final and definite purpose
 expressed. Several authors have expressed it as their opinion that
 the Paris Manuscript</i> C <i>is a complete and finished treatise on
 Light and Shade. Certainly, the Principles of Light and Shade form
 by far the larger portion of this MS. which consists of two separate
 parts; still, the materials are far from being finally arranged. It
 is also evident that he here investigates the subject from the point
 of view of the Physicist rather than from that of the Painter.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>The plan of a scheme of arrangement suggested in No.</i> III <i>and
 adopted by me has been strictly adhered to for the first four Books.
 For the three last, however, few materials have come down to us; and
 it must be admitted that these three Books would find a far more
 appropriate place in a work on Physics than in a treatise on
 Painting. For this reason I have collected in Book V all the
 chapters on Reflections, and in Book VI I have put together and
 arranged all the sections of MS.</i> C <i>that belong to the book on
 Painting, so far as they relate to Light and Shade, while the
 sections of the same MS. which treat of the</i> "Prospettiva de'
 perdimenti" <i>have, of course, been excluded from the series on Light
 and Shade.</i>

 variations in Dozio's pamphlet <i>Degli scritti e disegni di Leonardo
 da Vinci</i>, Milan 1871, pp. 30--31. Dozio did not transcribe it from
 the original MS. which seems to have remained unknown to him, but
 from an old copy (MS. H. 227 in the Ambrosian Library).</p>
