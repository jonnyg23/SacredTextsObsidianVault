 <p>
 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> The apparent size of objects defined by calculation (99-105)</font></span>Linear Perspective deals with the action of the lines of sight, in
 proving by measurement how much smaller is a second object than the
 first, and how much the third is smaller than the second; and so on
 by degrees to the end of things visible. I find by experience that
 if a second object is as far beyond the first as the first is from
 the eye, although they are of the same size, the second will seem
 half the size of the first and if the third object is of the same
 size as the 2nd, and the 3rd is as far beyond the second as the 2nd
 from the first, it will appear of half the size of the second; and
 so on by degrees, at equal distances, the next farthest will be half
 the size of the former object. So long as the space does not exceed
 the length of 20 braccia. But, beyond 20 braccia figures of equal
 size will lose 2/4 and at 40 braccia they will lose 9/10, and 19/20
 at 60 braccia, and so on diminishing by degrees. This is if the
 picture plane is distant from you twice your own height. If it is
 only as far off as your own height, there will be a great difference
 between the first braccia and the second.

 <h3 align="CENTER">Footnotes</h3>
 <p><a name="fn_50"></a><a href="0099.htm#fr_50">59:48</a> : This chapter is included in DUFRESNE'S and MANZI'S
 editions of the Treatise on Painting. H. LUDWIG, in his commentary,
 calls this chapter "<i>eines der wichtigsten im ganzen Tractat</i>", but
 at the same time he asserts that its substance has been so
 completely disfigured in the best MS. copies that we ought not to
 regard Leonardo as responsible for it. However, in the case of this
 chapter, the old MS. copies agree with the original as it is
 reproduced above. From the chapters given later in this edition,
 which were written at a subsequent date, it would appear that
 Leonardo corrected himself on these points.</p>
