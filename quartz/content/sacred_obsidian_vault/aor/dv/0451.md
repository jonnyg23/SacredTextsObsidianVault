 What outlines are seen in trees at a distance against the sky which
 serves as their background?
 </p><p>
 The outlines of the ramification of trees, where they lie against
 the illuminated sky, display a form which more nearly approaches the
 spherical on proportion as they are remote, and the nearer they are
 the less they appear in this spherical form; as in the first tree
 <i>a</i> which, being near to the eye,

 displays the true form of its
 ramification; but this shows less in <i>b</i> and is altogether lost in
 <i>c</i>, where not merely the branches of the tree cannot be seen but
 the whole tree is distinguished with difficulty. Every object in
 shadow, of whatever form it may be, at a great distance appears to
 be spherical. And this occurs because, if it is a square body, at a
 very short distance it loses its angles, and a little farther off it
 loses still more of its smaller sides which remain. And thus before
 the whole is lost [to sight] the parts are lost, being smaller than
 the whole; as a man, who in such a distant position loses his legs,
 arms and head before [the mass of] his body, then the outlines of
 length are lost before those of breadth, and where they have become
 equal it would be a square if the angles remained; but as they are
 lost it is round.
