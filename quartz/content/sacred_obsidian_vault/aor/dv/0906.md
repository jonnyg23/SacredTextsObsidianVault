 If you keep the details of the spots of the moon under observation
 you will often find great variation in them, and this I myself have
 proved by drawing them. And this is caused by the clouds that rise
 from the waters in the moon, which come between the sun and those
 waters, and by their shadow deprive these waters of the sun's rays.
 Thus those waters remain dark, not being able to reflect the solar
 body.
