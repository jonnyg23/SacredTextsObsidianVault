 <i>We see clearly from the concluding sentence of section 49, where the
 author directly addresses the painter, that he must certainly have
 intended to include the elements of mathematics in his Book on the
 art of Painting. They are therefore here placed at the beginning. In
 section 50 the theory of the "Pyramid of Sight" is distinctly and
 expressly put forward as the fundamental principle of linear
 perspective, and sections 52 to 57 treat of it fully. This theory of
 sight can scarcely be traced to any author of antiquity. Such
 passages as occur in Euclid for instance, may, it is true, have
 proved suggestive to the painters of the Renaissance, but it would
 be rash to say any thing decisive on this point.
 </i></p><p>
 Leon Battista Alberti treats of the "Pyramid of Sight" at some
 length in his first Book of Painting; but his explanation differs
 widely from Leonardo's in the details. Leonardo, like Alberti, may
 have borrowed the broad lines of his theory from some views commonly
 accepted among painters at the time; but he certainly worked out its
 application in a perfectly original manner.
 </p><p>
 The axioms as to the perception of the pyramid of rays are followed
 by explanations of its origin, and proofs of its universal
 application (58--69). The author recurs to the subject with endless
 variations; it is evidently of fundamental importance in his
 artistic theory and practice. It is unnecessary to discuss how far
 this theory has any scientific value at the present day; so much as
 this, at any rate, seems certain: that from the artist's point of
 view it may still claim to be of immense practical utility.
 </p><p>
 According to Leonardo, on one hand, the laws of perspective are an
 inalienable condition of the existence of objects in space; on the
 other hand, by a natural law, the
 </p><p><a name="page_26"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 26</font></a></p>
 <p>eye, whatever it sees and wherever
 it turns, is subjected to the perception of the pyramid of rays in
 the form of a minute target. Thus it sees objects in perspective
 independently of the will of the spectator, since the eye receives
 the images by means of the pyramid of rays "just as a magnet
 attracts iron".
 </p><p>
 In connection with this we have the function of the eye explained by
 the Camera obscura, and this is all the more interesting and
 important because no writer previous to Leonardo had treated of this
 subject (70--73). <i>Subsequent passages, of no less special interest,
 betray his knowledge of refraction and of the inversion of the image
 in the camera and in the eye</i> (74--82).
 </p><p>
 <i>From the principle of the transmission of the image to the eye and
 to the camera obscura he deduces the means of producing an
 artificial construction of the pyramid of rays or--which is the same
 thing--of the image. The fundamental axioms as to the angle of sight
 and the vanishing point are thus presented in a manner which is as
 complete as it is simple and intelligible</i> (86--89).
 </p><p>
 <i>Leonardo distinguishes between simple and complex perspective</i> (90,
 91). <i>The last sections treat of the apparent size of objects at
 various distances and of the way to estimate it</i> (92--109).
