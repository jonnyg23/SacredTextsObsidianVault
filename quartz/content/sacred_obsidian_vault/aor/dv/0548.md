 <h3 align="CENTER">THE PRACTICAL METHODS OF LIGHT AND SHADE AND AERIAL PERSPECTIVE.</h3>
 <h3 align="CENTER">OF PAINTING: OF THE DARKNESS OF THE SHADOWS, OR I MAY SAY, THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE LIGHTS.</h3>
 <p>
 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> Gradations of light and shade.</font></span>Although practical painters attribute to all shaded objects--trees,
 fields, hair, beards and skin--four degrees of darkness in each
 colour they use: that is to say first a dark foundation, secondly a
 spot of colour somewhat resembling the form of the details, thirdly
 a somewhat brighter and more defined portion, fourthly the lights
 which are more conspicuous than other parts of the figure; still to
 me it appears that these gradations are infinite upon a continuous
 surface which is in itself infinitely divisible, and I prove it
 thus:-- <a name="fr_263"></a><a href="#fn_263"><font size="1">261</font></a>
 
 Let <i>a g</i> be a continuous surface and let <i>d</i> be the light which
 illuminates it; I say--by the 4th [proposition] which says that that
 side of an illuminated body is most highly lighted which is nearest
 to the source of light--that therefore <i>g</i> must be darker than <i>c</i>
 in proportion as the line <i>d g</i> is longer than the line <i>d c</i>, and
 consequently that these gradations of light--or rather of shadow,
 are not 4 only, but
 </p><p><a name="page_277"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 277</font></a></p>
 <p>may be conceived of as infinite, because <i>c d</i>
 is a continuous surface and every continuous surface is infinitely
 divisible; hence the varieties in the length of lines extending
 between the light and the illuminated object are infinite, and the
 proportion of the light will be the same as that of the length of
 the lines between them; extending from the centre of the luminous
 body to the surface of the illuminated object.
