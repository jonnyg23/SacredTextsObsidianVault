 <p><a name="fn_470"></a><a href="1453.htm#fr_470">436:776</a> : In July 1506 Pope Julius II gave Donna
 Lucrezia della Rovere, the daughter of his sister
 Lucchina, in marriage to the youthful Marcantonio
 Colonna, who, like his brothers Prospero and
 Fabrizio, became one of the most famous Captains
 of his family. He gave to him Frascati
 and made him a present of the palazzo he had
 built, when Cardinal, near the church of Santi Apostoli
 which is now known as the Palazzo Colonna
 (see GREGOROVIUS, <i>Gesch. der Stadt Rom.</i>
 Vol. VIII, book XIV I, 3. And COPPI, <i>Mem. Colonnesi</i>
 p. 251).</p>
