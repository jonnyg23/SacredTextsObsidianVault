 <i>Leonardo distinctly separates these branches of his subject, as may
 be seen in the beginning of No.</i> 295. <i>Attempts have been made to
 cast doubts on the results which Leonardo arrived at by experiment
 on the perspective of colour, but not with justice, as may be seen
 from the original text of section</i> 294.
 </p><p>
 <i>The question as to the composition of the atmosphere, which is
 inseparable from a discussion on Aerial Perspective, forms a
 separate theory which is treated at considerable length. Indeed the
 author enters into it so fully that we cannot escape the conviction
 that he must have dwelt with particular pleasure on this part of his
 subject, and that he attached great importance to giving it a
 character of general applicability.</i>
