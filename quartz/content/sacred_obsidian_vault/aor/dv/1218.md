 The watery element was left enclosed between the raised banks of the
 rivers, and the sea was seen between the uplifted earth and the
 surrounding air which has to envelope and enclose the complicated
 machine of the earth, and whose mass, standing between the water and
 the element of fire, remained much restricted and deprived of its
 indispensable moisture; the rivers will be deprived of their waters,
 the fruitful earth will put forth no more her light verdure; the
 fields will no more be decked with waving corn; all the animals,
 finding no fresh grass for pasture, will die and food will then be
 lacking to the lions and wolves and other beasts of prey, and to men
 who after many efforts will be compelled to abandon their life, and
 the human race will die out. In this way the fertile and fruitful
 earth will remain deserted, arid and sterile from the water being
 shut up in its interior, and from the activity of nature it will
 continue a little time to increase until the cold and subtle air
 being gone, it will be forced to end with the element of fire; and
 then its surface will be left burnt up to cinder and this will be
 the end of all terrestrial nature.
