 Remember that to be certain of the point of origin of any muscle,
 you must pull the sinew from which the muscle springs in such a way
 as to see that muscle move, and where it is attached to the
 ligaments of the bones.
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">NOTE.</h3>
 <p>
 You will never get any thing but confusion in demonstrating the
 muscles and their positions, origin, and termination, unless you
 first make a demonstration of thin muscles after the manner of linen
 threads; and thus you can represent them, one over another as nature
 has placed them; and thus, too, you can name them according to the
 limb they serve; for instance the motor of the point of the great
 toe, of its middle bone, of its first bone, &amp;c And when you have
 the knowledge you will draw, by the side of this, the true form and
 size and position of each muscle. But remember to give the threads
 which explain the situation of the muscles in the position which
 corresponds to the central line of each muscle; and so these threads
 will demonstrate the form of the leg and their distance in a plain
 and clear manner.

 I have removed the skin from a man who was so shrunk by illness that
 the muscles were worn down and remained in a state like thin
 membrane, in such a way that the sinews instead of merging in
 muscles ended in wide membrane; and where the bones were covered by
 the skin they had very little over their natural size.
