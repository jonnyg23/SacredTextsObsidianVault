 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> A guiding rule.</font></span>An object will appear more or less distinct at the same distance, in
 proportion as the atmosphere existing between the eye and that
 object is more or less clear. Hence, as I know that the greater or
 less quantity of the air that lies between the eye and the object
 makes the outlines of that object more or less indistinct, you must
 diminish the definiteness of outline of those objects in proportion
 to their increasing distance from the eye of the spectator.
