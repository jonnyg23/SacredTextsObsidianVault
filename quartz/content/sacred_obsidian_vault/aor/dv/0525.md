 If you want to represent a figure on a wall, the wall being
 foreshortened, while the figure is to appear in its proper form, and
 as standing free from the wall, you must proceed thus: have a thin
 plate of iron and make a small hole in the centre; this hole must be
 round. Set a light close to it in such a position as that it shines

 <p>through the central hole, then place any object or figure you please
 so close to the wall that it touches it and draw the outline of the
 shadow on the wall; then fill in the shade and add the lights; place
 the person who is to see it so that he looks through that same hole
 where at first the light was; and you will never be able to persuade
 yourself that the image is not detached from the wall.

 <p><a name="fn_252"></a><a href="0525.htm#fr_252">262:250</a> : <i>uno piccolo spiracelo nel mezzo</i>. M. RAVAISSON, in his
 edition of MS. A (Paris), p. 52, reads <i>nel muro</i>--evidently a
 mistake for <i>nel mezzo</i> which is quite plainly written; and he
 translates it <i>"fait lui une petite ouverture dans le mur,"</i> adding
 in a note: <i>"les mots 'dans le mur' paraissent etre de trop.
 Leonardo a du les ecrire par distraction"</i> But <i>'nel mezzo'</i> is
 clearly legible even on the photograph facsimile given by Ravaisson
 himself, and the objection he raises disappears at once. It is not
 always wise or safe to try to prove our author's absence of mind or
 inadvertence by apparent difficulties in the sense or connection of
 the text.</p>
