 <p><a name="fn_480"></a><a href="1457.htm#fr_480">438:786</a> : This note occurs on a pen and ink drawing
 made by Leonardo as a sketch for the celebrated
 large cartoon in the possession of the Royal Academy
 of Arts, in London. This cartoon is commonly
 supposed to be identical with that described
 and lauded by Vasari, which was exhibited in Florence
 at the time and which now seems to be lost.
 Mr. Alfred Marks, of Long Ditton, in his valuable
 paper (read before the Royal Soc. of Literature,
 June 28, 1882) "On the St. Anne of Leonardo da
 Vinci", has adduced proof that the cartoon now in the
 Royal Academy was executed earlier at Milan. The note
 here given, which is written on the sheet containing
 the study for the said cartoon, has evidently no
 reference to the drawing on which it is written
 but is obviously of the same date. Though I have
 not any opening here for discussing this question of
 the cartoon, it seemed to me important to point out
 that the character of the writing in this note does
 not confirm the opinion hitherto held that the Royal
 Academy cartoon was the one described by Vasari,
 but, on the contrary, supports the hypothesis put
 forward by Mr. Marks.</p>
