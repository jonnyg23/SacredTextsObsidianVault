 And this may be seen, as I saw it, by any one going up Monbroso
  <a name="fr_244"></a><a href="#fn_244"><font size="1">578</font></a>
 , a peak of the
 Alps which divide France from Italy. The base of this mountain gives
 birth to the 4 rivers which flow in four different directions
 through the whole of Europe. And no mountain has its base at so
 great a height as this, which lifts itself above almost all the
 clouds; and snow seldom falls there, but only hail in the summer,
 when the clouds are highest. And this hail lies [unmelted] there, so
 that if it were not for the absorption of the rising and falling
 clouds, which does not happen more than twice in an age, an enormous
 mass of ice would be piled up there by the layers of hail, and in
 the middle of July I found it very considerable; and I saw the sky
 above me quite dark, and the sun as it fell on the mountain was far
 brighter here than in the plains below, because a smaller extent of
 atmosphere lay between the summit of the mountain and the sun.

 <p><a name="fn_244"></a><a href="1060.htm#fr_244">246:578</a> : I have vainly enquired of every available authority for a
 solution of the mystery as to what mountain is intended by the name
 Monboso (Comp. Vol. I Nos. 300 and 301). It seems most obvious to
 refer it to Monte Rosa. ROSA derived from the Keltic ROS which
 survives in Breton and in Gaelic, meaning, in its first sense, a
 mountain spur, but which also--like HORN--means a very high peak;
 thus Monte Rosa would mean literally the High Peak.</p>
