 This edifice is inhabited [accessible] below and above, like San
 Sepolcro, and it is the same above as below, except that the upper
 story has the dome <i>c d</i>; and the  <a name="fr_42"></a><a href="#fn_42"><font size="1">376</font></a>

 <p>lower has the dome <i>a b</i>, and when you enter
 into the crypt, you descend 10 steps, and when you mount into the
 upper you ascend 20 steps, which, with 1/3 braccio for each, make 10
 braccia, and this is the height between one floor of the church and
 the other.

 <i>Above the plan on the same sheet is a view of the exterior. By the
 aid of these two figures and the description, sections of the
 edifice may easily be reconstructed. But the section drawn on the
 left side of the building seems not to be in keeping with the same
 plan, notwithstanding the explanatory note written underneath it:</i>
 "dentro il difitio di sopra" <i>(interior of the edifice
 above)</i> <a name="fr_43"></a><a href="#fn_43"><font size="1">377</font></a>
 .

 <i>Before leaving this group, it is well to remark that the germ of it
 seems already indicated by the diagonal lines in the plans <a href="pl085.htm#img_pl085">Pl. LXXXV</a>
 No. 11 and No. 7. We shall find another application of the same type
 to the Latin cross in <a href="pl097.htm#img_pl097">Pl. XCVII</a> No. 3.</i>

 <p><a name="fn_42"></a><a href="0756.htm#fr_42">50:376</a> : The church of San
 Sepolcro at Milan, founded in 1030 and repeatedly rebuilt after the
 middle of the XVIth century, still stands over the crypt of the
 original structure.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_43"></a><a href="0756.htm#fr_43">51:377</a>  1: <i>The small inner dome corresponds to</i> a b <i>on the
 plan--it rises from the lower church into the upper-- above, and
 larger, rises the dome</i> c d. <i>The aisles above and below thus
 correspond</i> (e di sopra come di sotto, salvoche etc.). <i>The only
 difference is, that in the section Leonardo has not taken the
 trouble to make the form octagonal, but has merely sketched circular
 lines in perspective.</i> J. P. R.</p>
