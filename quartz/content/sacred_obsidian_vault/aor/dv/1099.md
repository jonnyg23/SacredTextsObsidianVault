 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> Customs of Asiatic Nations (1099. 1100).</font></span>The Assyrians and the people of Euboea accustom their horses to
 carry sacks which they can at pleasure fill with air, and which in
 case of need they carry instead of the girth of the saddle above and
 at the side, and they are well covered with plates of cuir bouilli,
 in order that they may not be perforated by flights of arrows. Thus
 they have not on their minds their security in flight, when the
 victory is uncertain; a horse thus equipped enables four or five men
 to cross over at need.
