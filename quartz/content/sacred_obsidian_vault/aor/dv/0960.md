 In the West, near to Flanders, the sea rises and decreases every 6
 hours about 20 braccia, and 22 when the moon is in its favour; but
 20 braccia is the general rule, and this rule, as it is evident,
 cannot have the moon for its cause. This variation in the increase
 and decrease of the sea every 6 hours may arise from the damming up
 of the waters, which are poured into the Mediterranean by the
 quantity of rivers from Africa, Asia and Europe, which flow into
 that sea, and the waters which are given to it by those rivers; it
 pours them to the ocean

 <p>through the straits of Gibraltar, between
 Abila and Calpe  <a name="fr_172"></a><a href="#fn_172"><font size="1">506</font></a>
 . That ocean extends to the
 island of England and others farther North, and it becomes dammed up
 and kept high in various gulfs. These, being seas of which the
 surface is remote from the centre of the earth, have acquired a
 weight, which as it is greater than the force of the incoming waters
 which cause it, gives this water an impetus in the contrary
 direction to that in which it came and it is borne back to meet the
 waters coming out of the straits; and this it does most against the
 straits of Gibraltar; these, so long as this goes on, remain dammed
 up and all the water which is poured out meanwhile by the
 aforementioned rivers, is pent up [in the Mediterranean]; and this
 might be assigned as the cause of its flow and ebb, as is shown in
 the 21st of the 4th of my theory.
