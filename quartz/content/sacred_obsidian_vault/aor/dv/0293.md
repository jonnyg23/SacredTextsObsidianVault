 <p>
 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> An experiment.</font></span>All colours at a distance are undistinguishable in shadow, because
 an object which is not in the highest light is incapable of
 transmitting its image to the eye through an atmosphere more
 luminous than itself; since the lesser brightness must be absorbed
 by the greater. For instance: We, in a house, can see that all the
 colours on the surface of the walls are clearly and instantly
 visible when the windows of the house are open; but if we were to go
 out of the house and look in at the windows from a little distance
 to see the paintings on those walls, instead of the paintings we
 should see an uniform deep and colourless shadow.
