 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF THE COLOUR OF THE ATMOSPHERE.</h3>
 <p>
 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> On the colour of the atmosphere (300-307).</font></span>I say that the blueness we see in the atmosphere is not intrinsic
 colour, but is caused by warm vapour evaporated in minute and
 insensible atoms on which the solar rays fall, rendering them
 luminous against the infinite darkness of the fiery sphere which
 lies beyond and includes it. And this may be seen, as I saw it by
 any one going up  <a name="fr_132"></a><a href="#fn_132"><font size="1">130</font></a>
  Monboso, a peak of
 the Alps which divide France from Italy. The base of this mountain
 gives birth to the four rivers which flow in four different
 directions through the whole of Europe. And no mountain has its base
 at so great a height as this, which lifts itself almost above the
 clouds; and snow seldom falls there, but only hail in the summer,
 when the clouds are highest. And this hail lies [unmelted] there, so
 that if it were not for the absorption of the rising and falling
 clouds, which does not happen twice in an age, an enormous mass of
 ice would
 </p><p><a name="page_162"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 162</font></a></p>
 <p>be piled up there by the hail, and in the middle of July I
 found it very considerable. There I saw above me the dark sky, and
 the sun as it fell on the mountain was far brighter here than in the
 plains below, because a smaller extent of atmosphere lay between the
 summit of the mountain and the sun. Again as an illustration of the
 colour of the atmosphere I will mention the smoke of old and dry
 wood, which, as it comes out of a chimney, appears to turn very
 blue, when seen between the eye and the dark distance. But as it
 rises, and comes between the eye and the bright atmosphere, it at
 once shows of an ashy grey colour; and this happens because it no
 longer has darkness beyond it, but this bright and luminous space.
 If the smoke is from young, green wood, it will not appear blue,
 because, not being transparent and being full of superabundant
 moisture, it has the effect of condensed clouds which take distinct
 lights and shadows like a solid body. The same occurs with the
 atmosphere, which, when overcharged with moisture appears white, and
 the small amount of heated moisture makes it dark, of a dark blue
 colour; and this will suffice us so far as concerns the colour of
 the atmosphere; though it might be added that, if this transparent
 blue were the natural colour of the atmosphere, it would follow that
 wherever a larger mass air intervened between the eye and the
 element of fire, the azure colour would be more intense; as we see
 in blue glass and in sapphires, which are darker in proportion as
 they are larger. But the atmosphere in such circumstances behaves in
 an opposite manner, inasmuch as where a greater quantity of it lies
 between the eye and the sphere of fire, it is seen much whiter. This
 occurs towards the horizon. And the less the extent of atmosphere
 between the eye and the sphere of fire, the deeper is the blue
 colour, as may be seen even on low plains. Hence it follows, as I
 say, that the atmosphere assumes this azure hue by reason of the
 particles of moisture which catch the rays of the sun. Again, we may
 note the difference in particles of dust, or particles of smoke, in
 the sun beams admitted through holes into a dark chamber, when the
 former will look ash grey
 </p><p><a name="page_163"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 163</font></a></p>
 <p>and the thin smoke will appear of a most
 beautiful blue; and it may be seen again in in the dark shadows of
 distant mountains when the air between the eye and those shadows
 will look very blue, though the brightest parts of those mountains
 will not differ much from their true colour. But if any one wishes
 for a final proof let him paint a board with various colours, among
 them an intense black; and over all let him lay a very thin and
 transparent [coating of] white. He will then see that this
 transparent white will nowhere show a more beautiful blue than over
 the black--but it must be very thin and finely ground.
