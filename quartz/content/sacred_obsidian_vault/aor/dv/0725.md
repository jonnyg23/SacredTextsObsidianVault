 <p><a name="fn_12"></a><a href="0725.htm#fr_12">15:346</a> : In the original, lines 2-5, 12-14, 33-35, are written on
 the margin. This passage has been recently published by G. Govi in
 Vol. V, Ser. 3a, of <i>Transunti, Reale Accademia dei Linea, sed. del
 5 Giugno, 1881,</i> with the following introductory note: <i>"Desidero
 intanto che siano stampati questi pochi frammenti perche so che sono
 stati trascritti ultimamente, e verranno messi in luce tra poco
 fuori d'Italia. Li ripubblichi pure chi vuole, ma si sappia almeno
 che anche tra noi si conoscevano, e s'eran raccolti da anni per
 comporne, quando che fosse, una edizione ordinata degli scritti di
 Leonardo."</i>
 </p><p>
 The learned editor has left out line 22 and has written 3 <i>pie</i> for
 8 <i>piedi</i> in line 25. There are other deviations of less importance
 from the original.</p>
