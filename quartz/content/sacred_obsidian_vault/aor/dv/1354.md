 the bloody and miry state of the ground it was as though a mountain
 had fallen so that the country shook as with an earthquake, and
 terror fell on Pluto in hell. From the violence of the shock he lay
 as stunned on the level ground. Suddenly the people, seeing him as
 one killed by a thunderbolt, turned back; like ants running wildly
 over the body of the fallen oak, so these rushing over his ample
 limbs.......... them with

 <p>frequent wounds; by which, the giant being roused and feeling
 himself almost covered by the multitude, he suddenly perceives the
 smarting of the stabs, and sent forth a roar which sounded like a
 terrific clap of thunder; and placing his hands on the ground he
 raised his terrible face: and having lifted one hand to his head he
 found it full of men and rabble sticking to it like the minute
 creatures which not unfrequently are found there; wherefore with a
 shake of his head he sends the men flying through the air just as
 hail does when driven by the fury of the winds. Many of these men
 were found to be dead; stamping with his feet.

 And clinging to his hair, and striving to hide in it, they behaved
 like sailors in a storm, who run up the ropes to lessen the force of
 the wind [by taking in sail].

 News of things from the East.

 Be it known to you that in the month of June there appeared a Giant,
 who came from the Lybian desert... mad with rage like ants....
 struck down by the rude.

 This great Giant was born in Mount Atlas and was a hero ... and had
 to fight against the Egyptians and Arabs, Medes and Persians. He
 lived in the sea on whales, grampuses and ships.

 And at the great fall it seemed as though the whole province quaked.

 <p><a name="fn_381"></a><a href="1354.htm#fr_381">410:687</a> : 1354. A puzzling passage, meant, as it would seem, for a
 jest. Compare the description of Giants in Dante, <i>Inf</i>. XXI and
 XXII. Perhaps Leonardo had the Giant Antaeus in his mind. Of him the
 myth relates that he was a son of Ge, that he fed on lions; that he
 hunted in Libya and killed the inhabitants. He enjoyed the
 peculiarity of renewing his strength whenever he fell and came in
 contact with his mother earth; but that Hercules lifted him up and
 so conquered and strangled him. Lucan gives a full account of the
 struggle. Pharsalia IV, 617. The reading of this passage, which is
 very indistinctly written, is in many places doubtful.</p>
