 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF TREES THAT ARE LIGHTED BY THE SUN AND BY THE ATMOSPHERE.</h3>
 <p>
 In trees that are illuminated [both] by the sun and the atmosphere
 and that have leaves of a dark colour, one side will be illuminated
 by the atmosphere [only] and in consequence of this light will tend
 to blueness, while on the other side they will be illuminated by the
 atmosphere and the sun; and the side which the eye sees illuminated
 by the sun will reflect light.
