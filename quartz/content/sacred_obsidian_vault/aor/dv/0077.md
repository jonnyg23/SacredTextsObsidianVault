 <p>
 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> The intersection of the rays (76-82).</font></span>What difference is there in the way in which images pass through
 narrow openings and through large openings, or in those which pass
 by the sides of shaded bodies? By moving the edges of the opening
 through which the images are admitted, the images of immovable
 objects are made to move. And this happens, as is shown in the 9th
 which demonstrates:  <a name="fr_41"></a><a href="#fn_41"><font size="1">39</font></a>
  the images of any object are all everywhere,
 and all in each part of the surrounding air. It follows that if one
 of the edges of the hole by which the images are admitted to a dark
 chamber is moved it cuts off those rays of the image that were in
 contact with it and gets nearer to other rays which previously were
 remote from it &amp;c

 <p>
 If you move the right side of the opening the image on the left will
 move [being that] of the object which entered on the right side of
 the opening; and the same result will happen with all the other
 sides of the opening. This can be proved by the 2nd of this which
 shows: all the rays which convey the images of objects through the
 air are straight lines. Hence, if the images of very large bodies
 have to pass through very small holes, and beyond these holes
 recover their large size, the lines must necessarily intersect.

 Leonardo refers thus to a number it serves to indicate marginal
