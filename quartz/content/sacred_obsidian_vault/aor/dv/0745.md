 The front <i>a m</i> will give light to the rooms; <i>a e</i> will be 6
 braccia--<i>a b</i> 8 braccia --<i>b e</i> 30 braccia, in order that the rooms
 under the porticoes may be lighted; <i>c d f</i> is the place where the
 boats come to the houses to be unloaded. In order to render this
 arrangement practicable, and in order that the inundation of the
 rivers may not penetrate into the cellars, it is necessary to chose
 an appropriate situation, such as a spot near a river which can be
 diverted into canals in which the level of the water will not vary
 either by inundations or drought. The construction is shown below;
 and make choice of a fine river, which the rains do not render
 muddy, such as the Ticino, the Adda and many others.  <a name="fr_22"></a><a href="#fn_22"><font size="1">356</font></a>
  The construction

 <p>to oblige the waters to
 keep constantly at the same level will be a sort of dock, as shown
 below, situated at the entrance of the town; or better still, some
 way within, in order that the enemy may not destroy it [14].
