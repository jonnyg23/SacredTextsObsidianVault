 <h3 align="CENTER"><i>Perspective of Disappearance.</i></h3>
 <i>The theory of the</i> "Prospettiva de' perdimenti" <i>would, in many
 important details, be quite unintelligible if it had not been led up
 by the principles of light and shade on which it is based. The word</i>
 "Prospettiva" <i>in the language of the time included the principles
 of optics; what Leonardo understood by</i> "Perdimenti" <i>will be
 clearly seen in the early chapters, Nos.</i> 222--224. <i>It is in the
 very nature of the case that the farther explanations given in the
 subsequent chapters must be limited to general rules. The sections
 given as</i> 227--231 <i>"On indistinctness at short distances" have, it
 is true, only an indirect bearing on the subject; but on the other
 hand, the following chapters,</i> 232--234, <i>"On indistinctness at
 great distances," go fully into the matter, and in chapters</i>
 235--239, <i>which treat "Of the importance of light and shade in the
 Perspective of Disappearance", the practical issues are distinctly
 insisted on in their relation to the theory. This is naturally
 followed by the statements as to "the effect of light or dark
 backgrounds on the apparent size of bodies"</i> (<i>Nos.</i> 240--250). <i>At
 the end I have placed, in the order of the original, those sections
 from the MS.</i> C <i>which treat of the "Perspective of Disappearance"
 and serve to some extent to complete the treatment of the subject</i>
 (251--262).
