 </p><h3 align="CENTER">HOW THAT DILIGENCE [ACCURACY] SHOULD FIRST BE LEARNT RATHER THAN RAPID EXECUTION.</h3>
 <p>
 If you, who draw, desire to study well and to good purpose, always
 go slowly to work in your drawing; and discriminate in. the lights,
 which have the highest degree of brightness, and to what extent and
 likewise in the shadows, which are those that are darker than the
 others and in what way they intermingle; then their masses and the
 relative proportions of one to the other. And note in their
 outlines, which way they tend; and which part of the lines is curved
 to one side or the other, and where they are more or less
 conspicuous and consequently broad or fine; and finally, that your
 light and shade blend without strokes and borders [but] looking like
 smoke. And when you have thus schooled your hand and your judgment
 by such diligence, you will acquire rapidity before you are aware.
