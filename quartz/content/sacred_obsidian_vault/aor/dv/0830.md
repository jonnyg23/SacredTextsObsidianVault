 <i>a b n</i> is the membrane which closes the eye from below, upwards,
 with an opaque film, <i>c n b</i> encloses the eye in front and behind
 with a transparent membrane.
 </p><p>
 It closes from below, upwards, because it [the eye] comes downwards.
 </p><p>
 When the eye of a bird closes with its two lids, the first to close
 is the nictitating membrane which closes from the lacrymal duct over
 to the outer corner of the eye; and the outer lid closes from below
 upwards, and these two intersecting motions begin first from the
 lacrymatory duct, because we have already seen that in front and
 below birds are protected and use only the upper portion of the eye
 from fear of birds of prey which come down from above and behind;
 and they uncover first the membrane from the outer corner, because
 if the enemy comes from behind, they have the power of escaping to
 the front; and again the muscle called the nictitating membrane is
 transparent, because, if the eye had not such a screen, they could
 not keep it open against the wind which strikes against the eye in
 the rush of their rapid flight. And the pupil of the eye dilates and
 contracts as it sees a less or greater light, that is to say intense
 brilliancy.
