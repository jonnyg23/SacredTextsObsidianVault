 Every body in light and shade fills the surrounding air with
 infinite images of itself; and these, by infinite pyramids diffused
 in the air, represent this body throughout space and on every side.
 Each pyramid that is composed of a long assemblage of rays includes
 within itself an infinite number of pyramids and each has the same
 power as all, and all as each. A circle of equidistant pyramids of
 vision will give to their object angles of equal size; and an eye at
 each point will see the object of the same size. The body of the
 atmosphere is full of infinite pyramids composed of radiating
 straight lines, which are produced from the surface of the bodies in
 light and shade, existing in the air; and the farther they are from
 the object which produces them the more acute they become and
 although in their distribution they intersect and cross they never
 mingle together, but pass through all the surrounding air,
 independently converging, spreading, and diffused. And they are all
 of equal power [and value]; all equal to each, and each equal to
 all. By these the images of objects are transmitted through all
 space and in every direction, and each pyramid, in itself, includes,
 in each minutest part, the whole form of the body causing it.
