 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF THE SHADOWS OF VERDURE.</h3>
 <p>
 The shadows of verdure are always somewhat blue, and so is every
 shadow of every object; and they assume this hue more in proportion
 as they are remote from the eye, and less in proportion as they are
 nearer.
 </p><p><a name="page_221"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 221</font></a></p>
 <p></p><p>The leaves which reflect the blue of the atmosphere always
 present themselves to the eye edgewise.
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF THE ILLUMINATED PART OF VERDURE AND OF MOUNTAINS.</h3>
 <p>
 The illuminated portion, at a great distance, will appear most
 nearly of its natural colour where the strongest light falls upon
 it.
