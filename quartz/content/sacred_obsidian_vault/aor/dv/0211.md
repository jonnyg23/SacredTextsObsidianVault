 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> Appendix:--On shadows in movement (211. 212).</font></span>When two bodies casting shadows, and one in front of the other, are
 between a window and the wall with some space between them, the
 shadow of the body which is nearest to the plane of the wall will
 move if the body nearest to the window is put in transverse motion
 across the window. To prove this let <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> be two bodies
 placed between the window <i>n m</i> and the plane surface <i>o p</i> with
 sufficient space between them as shown by the space <i>a b</i>. I say
 that if the body <i>a</i> is moved towards <i>s</i> the shadow of the body <i>b</i>
 which is at <i>c</i> will move towards <i>d</i>.
