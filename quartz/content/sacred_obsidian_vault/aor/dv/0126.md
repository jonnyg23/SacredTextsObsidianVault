 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> Of the various kinds of light (126, 127).</font></span>Separate light is that which falls upon the body. Inseparable light
 is the side of the body that is illuminated by that light. One is
 called primary, the other derived. And, in the same way there are
 two kinds of shadow:--One primary and the other derived. The primary
 is that which is inseparable from the body, the derived is that
 which proceeds from the body conveying to the surface of the wall
 the form of the body causing it.
