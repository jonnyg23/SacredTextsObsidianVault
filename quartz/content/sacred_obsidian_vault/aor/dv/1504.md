 <h3 align="CENTER">Footnotes</h3>
 <p><a name="fn_547"></a><a href="1504.htm#fr_547">458:847</a> : In the original, the passage given as No. 1463
 is written between lines 2 and 3 of this text, and
 it is possible that the entries in lines 3 and 4 refer
 to the payments of Jacopo Tedesco, who is there
 mentioned. The first words of these lines are very
 illegible.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_548"></a><a href="1504.htm#fr_548">458:848</a> : 7. Al fattore.<i> Il Fattore, was, as is well known,
 the nick-name of Giovanni Franceso Penni, born in
 Florence in 1486, and subsequently a pupil of Raphael's.
 According to Vasari he was known by it
 even as a boy. Whether he is spoken of in this
 passage, or whether the word Fattore should be translated
 literally, I will not undertake to decide. The
 latter seems to me more probably right.</i></p>
