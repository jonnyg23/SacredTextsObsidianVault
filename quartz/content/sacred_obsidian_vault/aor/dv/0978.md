 All the torrents of water flowing from the mountains to the sea
 carry with them the stones from the hills to the sea, and by the
 influx of the sea-water towards the mountains; these stones were
 thrown back towards the mountains, and as the waters rose and
 retired, the stones were tossed about by it and in rolling, their
 angles hit together; then as the parts, which least resisted the
 blows, were worn off, the stones ceased to be angular and became
 round in form, as may be seen on the banks of the Elsa. And those
 remained larger which were less removed

 <p>from their native spot; and
 they became smaller, the farther they were carried from that place,
 so that in the process they were converted into small pebbles and
 then into sand and at last into mud. After the sea had receded from
 the mountains the brine left by the sea with other humours of the
 earth made a concretion of these pebbles and this sand, so that the
 pebbles were converted into rock and the sand into tufa. And of this
 we see an example in the Adda where it issues from the mountains of
 Como and in the Ticino, the Adige and the Oglio coming from the
 German Alps, and in the Arno at Monte Albano  <a name="fr_183"></a><a href="#fn_183"><font size="1">517</font></a>
 , near
 Monte Lupo and Capraia where the rocks, which are very large, are
 all of conglomerated pebbles of various kinds and colours.
