 Why an impetus is not spent at once [but diminishes] gradually in
 some one direction?  <a name="fr_195"></a><a href="#fn_195"><font size="1">193</font></a>
  The impetus acquired in the line <i>a b c d</i> is spent
 in the line <i>d e</i> but not so completely but that some of its force
 remains in it and to this force is added the momentum in the line <i>d
 e</i> with the force of the motive power, and it must follow than the
 impetus multiplied by the blow is greater that the simple impetus
 produced by the momentum <i>d e</i>.

  A man
 who has to deal a great blow with his weapon prepares himself with
 all his force on the opposite side to that where the spot is which
 he is to hit; and this is because a body as it gains in velocity
 gains in force against the object which impedes its motion.
