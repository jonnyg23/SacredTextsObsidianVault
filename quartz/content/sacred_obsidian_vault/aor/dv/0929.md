 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> General introduction.</font></span>By the ancients man has been called the world in miniature; and
 certainly this name is well bestowed, because, inasmuch as man is
 composed of earth, water, air and fire, his body resembles that of
 the earth; and as man has in him bones the supports and framework of
 his flesh, the world has its rocks the supports of the earth; as man
 has in him a pool of blood in which the lungs rise and fall in
 breathing, so the body of the earth has its ocean tide which
 likewise rises and falls every six hours, as if the world breathed;
 as in that pool of blood veins have their origin, which ramify all
 over the human body, so likewise the ocean sea fills the body of the
 earth with infinite springs of water. The body of the earth lacks
 sinews and this is, because the sinews are made expressely for
 movements and, the world being perpetually stable, no movement takes
 place, and no movement taking place, muscles are not necessary.
 --But in all other points they are much alike.
