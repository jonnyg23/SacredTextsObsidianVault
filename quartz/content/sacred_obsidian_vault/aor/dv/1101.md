 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> Rhodes (1101. 1102).</font></span>In [fourteen hundred and] eighty nine there was an earthquake in the
 sea of Atalia near Rhodes, which opened the sea--that is its
 bottom--and into this opening such a torrent of water poured that
 for more than three hours the bottom of the sea was uncovered by
 reason of the water which was lost in it, and then it closed to the
 former level.

 <p><a name="fn_277"></a><a href="1101.htm#fr_277">265:611</a> : <i>Nello ottanto</i> 9. It is scarcely likely that Leonardo
 should here mean 89 AD. Dr. H. MULLER- STRUBING writes to me as
 follows on this subject: "With reference to Rhodes Ross says (<i>Reise
 auf den Griechischen Inseln, III</i> 70 <i>ff</i>. 1840), that ancient
 history affords instances of severe earthquakes at Rhodes, among
 others one in the second year of the 138th Olympiad=270 B. C.; a
 remarkably violent one under Antoninus Pius (A. D. 138-161) and
 again under Constantine and later. But Leonardo expressly speaks of
 an earthquake "<i>nel mar di Atalia presso a Rodi</i>", which is
 singular. The town of Attalia, founded by Attalus, which is what he
 no doubt means, was in Pamphylia and more than 150 English miles
 East of Rhodes in a straight line. Leake and most other geographers
 identify it with the present town of Adalia. Attalia is rarely
 mentioned by the ancients, indeed only by Strabo and Pliny and no
 earthquake is spoken of. I think therefore you are justified in
 assuming that Leonardo means 1489". In the elaborate catalogue of
 earthquakes in the East by Sciale Dshelal eddin Sayouthy (an
 unpublished Arabic MS. in the possession of Prof. SCHEFER, (Membre
 de l'Institut, Paris) mention is made of a terrible earthquake in
 the year 867 of the Mohamedan Era corresponding to the year 1489,
 and it is there stated that a hundred persons were killed by it in
 the fortress of Kerak. There are three places of this name. Kerak on
 the sea of Tiberias, Kerak near Tahle on the Libanon, which I
 visited in the summer of l876--but neither of these is the place
 alluded to. Possibly it may be the strongly fortified town of
 Kerak=Kir Moab, to the West of the Dead Sea. There is no notice
 about this in ALEXIS PERCY, <i>Memoire sur les tremblements de terres
 ressentis dans la peninsule turco- hellenique et en Syrie (Memoires
 couronnes et memoires des savants etrangers, Academie Royale de
 Belgique, Tome XXIII).</i></p>
