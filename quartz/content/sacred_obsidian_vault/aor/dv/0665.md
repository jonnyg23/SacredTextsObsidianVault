 Another, twisting the fingers of his hands together turns with stern
 brows to his companion [6]. Another with his hands spread open shows
 the palms, and shrugs his shoulders up his ears making a mouth of
 astonishment [8].

 [9] Another speaks into his neighbour's ear and he, as he listens to
 him, turns towards him to lend an ear [10], while he holds a knife
 in one hand, and in the other the loaf half cut through by the
 knife. [13] Another who has turned, holding a knife in his hand,
 upsets with his hand a glass on the table [14].

 <p><a name="fn_303"></a><a href="0665.htm#fr_303">347:301</a>  665, 666: In the original MS. there is no sketch to
 accompany these passages, and if we compare them with those drawings
 made by Leonardo in preparation for the composition of the
 picture--<a href="pl045.htm#img_pl045">Pl. XLV</a>, <a href="pl046.htm#img_pl046">XLVI</a>--, (compare also <a href="pl052.htm#img_pl052">Pl. LII</a>, 1 and the drawings
 on p. 297) it is impossible to recognise in them a faithful
 interpretation of the whole of this text; but, if we compare these
 passages with the finished picture (see p. 334) we shall see that in
 many places they coincide. For instance, compare No. 665, 1. 6--8,
 with the fourth figure on the right hand of Christ. The various
 actions described in lines 9--10, 13--14 are to be seen in the group
 of Peter, John and Judas; in the finished picture however it is not
 a glass but a salt cellar that Judas is upsetting.</p>
