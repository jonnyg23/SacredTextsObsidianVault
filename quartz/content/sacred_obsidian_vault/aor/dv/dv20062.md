 <p>
 The problem as to what form of church might answer the requirements
 of acoustics seems to have engaged Leonardo's very particular
 attention. The designation of "teatro" <i>given to some of these
 sketches, clearly shows which plan seemed to him most favourable for
 hearing the preacher's voice.

 <a href="pl097.htm#img_pl097">Pl. XCVII</a>, No. 1 (MS. B, 52). Rectangular edifice divided into three
 naves with an apse on either side, terminated by a semicircular
 theatre with rising seats, as in antique buildings. The pulpit is in
 the centre. Leonardo has written on the left side of the sketch:
 "teatro da predicare" <i>(Theatre for preaching).

 MS. B, 55a (see page 56, Fig. 1). A domed church after the type of
 <a href="pl095.htm#img_pl095">Pl. XCV</a>, No. 1, shows four theatres occupying the apses and facing
 the square "coro" <i>(choir), which is in the centre between the four
 pillars of the dome.</i> <a name="fr_47"></a><a href="#fn_47"><font size="1">381</font></a>
 <i> The rising arrangement of the seats is shown in the sketch
 above. At the place marked</i> B <i>Leonardo wrote</i> teatri per uldire
 messa <i>(rows of seats to hear mass), at</i> T teatri,<i> and at</i> C coro
 <i>(choir).

 In MS. C.A. 260, are slight sketches of two plans for rectangular
 choirs and two elevations of the altar and pulpit which seem to be
 in connection with these plans.

 In MS. Ash II, 8a (see p. 56 and 57. Fig. 2 and 3). "Locho dove si
 predica" <i>(Place for preaching). A most singular plan for a
 building. The interior is a portion of a sphere, the centre of which
 is the summit of a column destined to serve as the preacher's
 pulpit. The inside is somewhat</i>

 thirds of the circle. Leonardo wrote in the centre</i> "fondamento", <i>a
 word he often employed for plans, and on the left side of the view
 of the exterior:</i> locho dove si predicha <i>(a place for preaching
 in).</i>
