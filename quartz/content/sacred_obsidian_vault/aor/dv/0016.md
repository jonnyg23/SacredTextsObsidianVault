 Perspective, as bearing on drawing, is divided into three principal
 sections; of which the first treats of the diminution in the size of
 bodies at different distances. The second part is that which treats
 of the diminution in colour in these objects. The third [deals with]
 the diminished distinctness of the forms and outlines displayed by
 the objects at various distances.
