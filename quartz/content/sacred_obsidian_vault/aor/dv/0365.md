 Which are the muscles which subdivide in old age or in youth, when
 becoming lean? Which are the parts of the limbs of the human frame
 where no amount of fat makes the flesh thicker, nor any degree of
 leanness ever diminishes it?
 </p><p>
 The thing sought for in this question will be found in all the
 external joints of the bones, as the shoulder, elbow, wrists,
 finger-joints, hips, knees, ankle-bone and toes and the like; all of
 which shall be told in its place. The greatest thickness acquired by
 any limb is at the part of the muscles which is farthest from its
 attachments.
 </p><p>
 Flesh never increases on those portions of the limb where the bones
 are near to the surface.

 At <i>b r d a c e f</i> the increase or diminution of the flesh never
 makes any considerable difference. Nature has placed in front of man
 all those parts which feel most pain under a blow; and these are the
 shin of the leg, the forehead, and the nose. And this was done for
 the preservation of man, since, if such pain were not felt in these
 parts, the number of blows to which they would be exposed must be
 the cause of their destruction.
 </p><p>
 Describe why the bones of the arm and leg are double near the hand
 and foot [respectively].
 </p><p>
 And where the flesh is thicker or thinner in the bending of the
 limbs.
