 For the third and last reason we will say that salt is in all
 created things; and this we learn from water passed over the ashes
 and cinders of burnt things; and the urine of every animal, and the
 superfluities issuing from their bodies, and the earth into which
 all things are converted by corruption.

 But,--to put it better,--given that the world is everlasting, it
 must be admitted that its population will also be eternal; hence the
 human species has eternally been and would be consumers of salt; and
 if all the mass of the earth were to be turned into salt,

 ; whence
 we are forced to admit, either that the species of salt must be
 everlasting like the world, or that it dies and is born again like
 the men who devour it. But as experience teaches us that it does not
 die, as is evident by fire, which does not consume it, and by water
 which becomes salt in proportion to the quantity dissolved in
 it,--and when it is evaporated the salt always remains in the
 original quantity--it must pass through the bodies of men either in
 the urine or the sweat or other excretions where it is found again;
 and as much salt is thus got rid of as is carried every year into
 towns; therefore salt is dug in places where there is urine.-- Sea
 hogs and sea winds are salt.

 We will say that the rains which penetrate the earth are what is
 under the foundations of cities with their inhabitants, and are what
 restore through the internal passages of the earth the saltness
 taken from the sea; and that the change in the place of the sea,
 which has been over all the mountains, caused it to be left there in
 the mines found in those mountains, &amp;c
