 <p>
 I know one who, having promised me much, less than my due, being
 disappointed of his presumptuous desires, has tried to deprive me of
 all my friends; and as he has found them wise and not pliable to his
 will, he has menaced me that, having found means of denouncing me,
 he would deprive me of my benefactors. Hence I have informed your
 Lordship of this, to the end [that this man who wishes to sow the
 usual scandals, may find no soil fit for sowing the thoughts and
 deeds of his evil nature] so that he, trying to make your Lordship,
 the instrument of his iniquitous and maliceous nature may be
 disappointed of his desire.
