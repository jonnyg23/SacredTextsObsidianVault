 A rat was besieged in his little dwelling by a weasel, which with
 unwearied vigilance awaited his surrender, while watching his
 imminent peril through a little hole. Meanwhile the cat came by and
 suddenly seized the weasel and forthwith devoured it. Then the rat
 offered up a sacrifice to Jove of some of his store of nuts, humbly
 thanking His providence, and came out of his hole to enjoy his
 lately lost liberty. But he was instantly deprived of it, together
 with his life, by the cruel claws and teeth of the lurking cat.
