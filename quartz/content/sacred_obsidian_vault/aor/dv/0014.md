 </p><h3 align="CENTER">ON THE THREE BRANCHES OF PERSPECTIVE.</h3>
 <p>
 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> The plan of the book on Painting (14--17).</font></span>There are three branches of perspective; the first deals with the
 reasons of the (apparent) diminution of objects as they recede from
 the eye, and is known as Diminishing Perspective.--The second
 contains the way in which colours vary as they recede from the eye.
 The third and last is concerned with the explanation of how the
 objects [in a picture] ought to be less finished in proportion as
 they are remote (and the names are as follows):
 </p><p>
 Linear Perspective.<br>
 The Perspective of Colour.<br>
 The Perspective of Disappearance.
