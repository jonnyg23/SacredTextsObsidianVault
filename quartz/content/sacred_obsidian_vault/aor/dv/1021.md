 the rays of the sun, which was already close to the horizon and red,
 tinged the cloud with its own hue. And this cloud attracted to it
 all the little clouds that were near while the large one did not
 move from its place; thus it retained on its summit the reflection
 of the sunlight till an hour and a half after sunset, so immensely
 large was it; and about two hours after sunset such a violent wind
 arose, that it was really tremendous and unheard of.
