 If any man could have discovered the
 utmost powers of the cannon, in all its
 various forms and have given such a secret
 to the Romans, with what rapidity would
 they have conquered every country and have
 vanquished every army, and what reward could
 have been great enough for such a service!
 Archimedes indeed, although he had greatly
 damaged the Romans in the siege of Syra-
 cuse, nevertheless did not fail of being offered
 great rewards from these very Romans; and
 when Syracuse was taken, diligent search was
 made for Archimedes; and he being found
 dead greater lamentation was made for him
 by the Senate and people of Rome than if
 they had lost all their army; and they
 did not fail to honour him with burial and
 with a statue. At their head was Marcus
 Marcellus. And after the second destruction
 of Syracuse, the sepulchre of Archimedes was
 found again by Cato[25], in the ruins of a
 temple. So Cato had the temple restored and
 the sepulchre he so highly honoured....
 Whence it is written that Cato said that he
 was not so proud of any thing he had done
 as of having paid such honour to Archimedes.

 <p><a name="fn_519"></a><a href="1476.htm#fr_519">446:819</a> : 1476. Where Leonardo found the statement that
 Cato had found and restored the tomb of Archi-
 medes, I do not know. It is a merit that Cicero
 claims as his own (Tusc. V, 23) and certainly with
 a full right to it. None of Archimedes' biographers
 -not even the diligent Mazzucchelli, mentions any
 version in which Cato is named. It is evidently a
 slip of the memory on Leonardo's part. Besides,
 according to the passage in Cicero, the grave was
 not found 'nelle mine ffun tempio'-which is highly
 improbable as relating to a Greek-but in an open
 spot (H. MULLER-STROBING).--See too, as to Archi-
 medes, No. 1417.
