 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> Fables on lifeless objects (1271--1274).</font></span>The water finding that its element was the lordly ocean, was seized
 with a desire to rise above the air, and being encouraged by the
 element of fire and rising as a very subtle vapour, it seemed as
 though it were really as thin as air. But having risen very high, it
 reached the air that was still more rare and cold, where the fire
 forsook it, and the minute particles, being brought together, united
 and became heavy; whence its haughtiness deserting it, it betook
 itself to flight and it fell from the sky, and was drunk up by the
 dry earth, where, being imprisoned for a long time, it did penance
 for its sin.
