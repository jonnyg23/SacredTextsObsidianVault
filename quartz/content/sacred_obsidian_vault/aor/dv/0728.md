 A paste of emery mixed with aqua vitae, or iron filings with

 powdered.

 The diameter is given in the lead enclosed; it is beaten with a
 hammer and several times extended; the lead is folded and kept
 wrapped up in parchment so that the powder may not be spilt; then
 melt the lead, and the powder will be on the top of the melted lead,
 which must then be rubbed between two plates of steel till it is
 thoroughly pulverised; then wash it with aqua fortis, and the
 blackness of the iron will be dissolved leaving the powder clean.
 </p><p>
 Emery in large grains may be broken by putting it on a cloth many
 times doubled, and hit it sideways with the hammer, when it will
 break up; then mix it little by little and it can be founded with
 ease; but if you hold it on the anvil you will never break it, when
 it is large.
 </p><p>
 Any one who grinds smalt should do it on plates of tempered steel
 with a cone shaped grinder; then put it in aqua fortis, which melts
 away the steel that may have been worked up and mixed with the
 smalt, and which makes it black; it then remains purified and clean;
 and if you grind it on porphyry the porphyry will work up and mix
 with the smalt and spoil it, and aqua fortis will never remove it
 because it cannot dissolve the porphyry.
 </p><p>
 If you want a fine blue colour dissolve the smalt made with tartar,
 and then remove the salt.
 </p><p>
 Vitrified brass makes a fine red.
