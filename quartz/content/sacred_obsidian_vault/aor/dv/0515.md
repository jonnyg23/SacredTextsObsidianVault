 </p><h3 align="CENTER">THAT THE LIGHT FOR DRAWING FROM NATURE SHOULD BE HIGH UP.</h3>
 <p>
 The light for drawing from nature should come from the North in
 order that it may not vary. And if you have it from the South, keep
 the window screened with cloth, so that with the sun shining the
 whole day the light may not vary. The height of the light should be
 so arranged as that every object shall cast a shadow on the ground
 of the same length as itself.
