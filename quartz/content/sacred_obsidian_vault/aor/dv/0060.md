 That the atmosphere attracts to itself, like a loadstone, all the
 images of the objects that exist in it, and not their forms merely
 but their nature may be clearly seen by the sun, which is a hot and
 luminous body. All the atmosphere, which is the all-pervading
 matter, absorbs light and heat, and reflects in itself the image of
 the source of that heat and splendour and, in each minutest portion,
 does the same. The Northpole does the same as the loadstone shows;
 and the moon and the other planets, without suffering any
 diminution, do the same. Among terrestrial things musk does the same
 and other perfumes.
