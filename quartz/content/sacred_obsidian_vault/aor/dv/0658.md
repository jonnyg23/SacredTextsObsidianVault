 <p>
 As soon as the poet ceases to represent in words what exists in
 nature, he in fact ceases to resemble the painter; for if the poet,
 leaving such representation, proceeds to describe the flowery and
 flattering speech of the figure, which he wishes to make the
 speaker, he then is an orator and no longer a poet nor a painter.
 And if he speaks of the heavens he becomes an astrologer, and
 philosopher; and a theologian, if he discourses of nature or God.
 But, if he restricts himself to the description of objects, he would
 enter the lists against the painter, if with words he could satisfy
 the eye as the painter does.
