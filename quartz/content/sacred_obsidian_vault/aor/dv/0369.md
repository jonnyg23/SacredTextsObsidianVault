 <p>
 A sitting man cannot raise himself if that part of his body which is
 front of his axis [centre of gravity] does not weigh more than that
 which is behind that axis [or centre] without using his arms.
 </p><p><a name="page_194"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 194</font></a></p>
 <p></p><p>
 A man who is mounting any slope finds that he must involuntarily
 throw the most weight forward, on the higher foot, rather than
 behind--that is in front of the axis and not behind it. Hence a man
 will always, involuntarily, throw the greater weight towards the
 point whither he desires to move than in any other direction.
 </p><p>
 The faster a man runs, the more he leans forward towards the point
 he runs to and throws more weight in front of his axis than behind.
 A man who runs down hill throws the axis onto his heels, and one who
 runs up hill throws it into the points of his feet; and a man
 running on level ground throws it first on his heels and then on the
 points of his feet.
 </p><p>
 This man cannot carry his own weight unless, by drawing his body
 back he balances the weight in front, in such a way as that the foot
 on which he stands is the centre of gravity.
