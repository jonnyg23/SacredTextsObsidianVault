 The vertical plane is a perpendicular line, imagined as in front of
 the central point where the apex of the pyramids converge. And this
 plane bears the same relation to this point as a plane of glass
 would, through which you might see the various objects and draw them
 on it. And the objects thus drawn would be smaller than the
 originals, in proportion as the distance between the glass and the
 eye was smaller than that between the glass and the objects.

 The different converging pyramids produced by the objects, will
 show, on the plane, the various sizes and remoteness of the objects
 causing them.

 <p>
 All those horizontal planes of which the extremes are met by
 perpendicular lines forming right angles, if they are of equal width
 the more they rise to the level of eye the less this is seen, and
 the more the eye is above them the more will their real width be
 seen.

 </p><h3 align="CENTER">PERSPECTIVE.</h3>
 <p>
 The farther a spherical body is from the eye the more you will see
 of it.
