 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> The globe an organism.</font></span>Nothing originates in a spot where there is no sentient, vegetable
 and rational life; feathers grow upon birds and are changed every
 year; hairs grow upon animals and are changed every year, excepting
 some parts, like the hairs of the beard in lions, cats and their
 like. The grass grows in the fields, and the leaves on the trees,
 and every year they are, in great part, renewed. So that we might
 say that the earth has a spirit of growth; that its flesh is the
 soil, its bones the arrangement and connection of the rocks of which
 the mountains are composed, its cartilage the tufa, and its blood
 the springs of water. The pool of blood which lies round the heart
 is the ocean, and its breathing, and the increase and decrease of
 the blood in the pulses, is represented in the earth by the flow and
 ebb of the sea; and the heat of the spirit of the world is the fire
 which pervades the earth, and the seat of the vegetative soul is in
 the fires, which in many parts of the earth find vent in baths and
 mines of sulphur, and in volcanoes, as at Mount Aetna in Sicily, and
 in many other places.
