 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF THE MOTIONS OF THE FINGERS.</h3>
 <p>
 The movements of the fingers principally consist in extending and
 bending them. This extension and bending vary in manner; that is,
 sometimes they bend altogether at the first joint; sometimes they
 bend, or extend, half way, at the 2nd joint; and sometimes they bend
 in their whole length and in all the three joints at once. If the 2
 first joints are hindered from bending, then the 3rd joint can be
 bent with greater ease than before; it can never bend of itself, if
 the other joints are free, unless all three joints are bent. Besides
 all these movements there are 4 other principal motions of which 2
 are up and down, the two others from side to side; and each of these
 is effected by a single tendon. From these there follow an infinite
 number of other movements always effected by two tendons; one tendon
 ceasing to act, the other takes up the movement. The tendons are
 made thick inside the fingers and thin outside; and the tendons
 inside are attached to every joint but outside they are not.
