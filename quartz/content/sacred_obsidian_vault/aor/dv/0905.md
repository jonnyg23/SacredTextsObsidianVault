 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF THE SPOTS ON THE MOON.</h3>
 <p>
 It has been asserted, that the spots on the moon result from the
 moon being of varying thinness or density; but if this were so, when
 there is an eclipse of the moon the solar rays would pierce through
 the portions which were thin as is alleged  <a name="fr_150"></a><a href="#fn_150"><font size="1">484</font></a>
 . But as
 we do not see this effect the opinion must be false.

 Others say that the surface of the moon is smooth and polished and
 that, like a mirror, it reflects in itself the image of our earth.
 This view is also false, inasmuch as the land, where it is not
 covered with water, presents various aspects and forms. Hence when
 the moon is in the East it would reflect different spots from those
 it would show when it is above us or in the West; now the spots on
 the moon, as they are seen at full moon, never vary in the course of
 its motion over our hemisphere. A second reason is that an object
 reflected in a convex body takes up but a small portion of that
 body, as is proved in perspective  <a name="fr_151"></a><a href="#fn_151"><font size="1">485</font></a>
 . The third reason is that
 when the moon is full, it only faces half the hemisphere of the
 </p><p><a name="page_167"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 167</font></a></p>
 <p>illuminated earth, on which only the ocean and other waters reflect
 bright light, while the land makes spots on that brightness; thus
 half of our earth would be seen girt round with the brightness of
 the sea lighted up by the sun, and in the moon this reflection would
 be the smallest part of that moon. Fourthly, a radiant body cannot
 be reflected from another equally radiant; therefore the sea, since
 it borrows its brightness from the sun,--as the moon does--, could
 not cause the earth to be reflected in it, nor indeed could the body
 of the sun be seen reflected in it, nor indeed any star opposite to
 it.

 <p><a name="fn_150"></a><a href="0905.htm#fr_150">166:484</a>  3-5: <i>Eclissi</i>.
 This word, as it seems to me, here means eclipses of the sun; and
 the sense of the passage, as I understand it, is that by the
 foregoing hypothesis the moon, when it comes between the sun and the
 earth must appear as if pierced,--we may say like a sieve.</p>

 This alludes to the accompanying diagram.</p>
