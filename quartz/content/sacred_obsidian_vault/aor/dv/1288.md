 A man was arguing and boasting that he knew many and various tricks.
 Another among the bystanders said: "I know how to play a trick which
 will make whomsoever I like pull off his breeches." The first man--
 the boaster--said: "You won't make me pull off mine, and I bet you a
 pair of hose on it." He who proposed the game, having accepted the
 offer, produced breeches and drew them across the face of him who
 bet the pair of hose and won the bet [4].

 A man said to an acquaintance: "Your eyes are changed to a strange
 colour." The other replied: "It often happens, but you have not
 noticed it." "When does it happen?" said the former. "Every time
 that my eyes see your ugly face, from the shock of so unpleasing a
 sight they suddenly turn pale and change to a strange colour."

 A man said to another: "Your eyes are changed to a strange colour."
 The other replied: "It is because my eyes behold your strange ugly
 face."

 A man said that in his country were the strangest things in the
 world. Another answered: "You, who were born there, confirm this as
 true, by the strangeness of your ugly face."
