 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF HELPING THE APPARENT RELIEF OF A PICTURE BY GIVING IT ARTIFICIAL</h3>
 <h3 align="CENTER">LIGHT AND SHADE.</h3>
 <p>
 To increase relief of a picture you may place, between your figure
 and the solid object on which its shadow falls, a line of bright
 light, dividing the figure from the object in shadow. And on the
 same object you shall represent two light parts which will surround
 the shadow cast upon the wall
 </p><p><a name="page_279"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 279</font></a></p>
 <p>by the figure placed opposite [6]; and
 do this frequently with the limbs which you wish should stand out
 somewhat from the body they belong to; particularly when the arms
 cross the front of the breast show, between the shadow cast by the
 arms on the breast and the shadow on the arms themselves, a little
 light seeming to fall through a space between the breast and the
 arms; and the more you wish the arm to look detached from the breast
 the broader you must make the light; always contrive also to arrange
 the figures against the background in such a way as that the parts
 in shadow are against a light background and the illuminated
 portions against a dark background.
