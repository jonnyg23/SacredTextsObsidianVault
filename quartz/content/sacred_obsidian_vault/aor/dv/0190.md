 If a window <i>a b</i> admits the sunlight into a room, the sunlight will
 magnify the size of the window and diminish the shadow of a man in
 such a way as that when the man makes that dim shadow of himself,
 approach to that which defines the real size of the window, he will
 see the shadows where they come into contact, dim and confused from
 the strength of the light, shutting off and not allowing the solar
 rays to pass; the effect of the shadow of the man cast by this
 contact will be exactly that figured above.

 <p><a name="fn_94"></a><a href="0190.htm#fr_94">107:92</a> : It is scarcely possible to render the meaning of this
 sentence with strict accuracy; mainly because the grammatical
 construction is defective in the most important part--line 4. In the
 very slight original sketch the shadow touches the upper arch of the
 window and the correction, here given is perhaps not justified.</p>
