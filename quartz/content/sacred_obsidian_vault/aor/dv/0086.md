 The object that is nearest to the eye always seems larger than
 another of the same size at greater distance. The eye <i>m</i>, seeing
 the spaces <i>o v x</i>, hardly detects the difference between them, and
 the. reason of this is that it is close to them  <a name="fr_48"></a><a href="#fn_48"><font size="1">46</font></a>
 ; but if these spaces are marked on the vertical plane <i>n o</i>
 the space <i>o v</i> will be seen at <i>o r</i>, and in the same way the space
 <i>v x</i> will appear at <i>r q</i>. And if you carry this out in any place
 where you can walk round, it will look out of proportion by reason
 of the great difference in the spaces <i>o r</i> and <i>r q</i>. And this
 proceeds from the eye being so much below [near] the plane that the
 plane is foreshortened. Hence, if you wanted to carry it out, you
 would have [to arrange] to see the perspective through a single hole
 which must be at the point <i>m</i>, or else you must go to a distance of
 at least 3 times the height of the object you see. The plane <i>o p</i>
 being always equally remote from the eye will reproduce the objects
 in a satisfactory way, so that they may be seen from place to place.

 quite inconceivable to me why M. RAVAISSON, in a note to his French
 translation of this simple passage should have remarked: <i>Il est
 clair que c'est par erreur que Leonard a ècrit</i> per esser visino <i>au
 lieu de</i> per non esser visino. (See his printed ed. of MS. A. p.
 38.)</p>
