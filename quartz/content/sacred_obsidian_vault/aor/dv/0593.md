 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> Of appropriate gestures (593-600).</font></span>A picture or representation of human figures, ought to be done in
 such a way as that the spectator may easily recognise, by means of
 their attitudes, the purpose in their minds. Thus, if you have to
 represent a man of noble character in the act of speaking, let his
 gestures be such as naturally accompany good words; and, in the same
 way, if you wish to depict a man of a brutal nature, give him fierce
 movements; as with his arms flung out towards the listener, and his
 head and breast thrust forward beyond his feet, as if following the
 speaker's hands. Thus it is with a deaf and dumb person who, when he
 sees two men in conversation--although he is deprived of
 hearing--can nevertheless understand, from the attitudes and
 gestures of the speakers, the nature of their discussion. I once saw
 in Florence a man who had become deaf who, when you spoke very loud
 did not understand you, but if you spoke gently and without making
 any sound, understood merely from the movement of the lips. Now
 perhaps you will say that the lips of a man who speaks loudly do not
 move like those of one speaking softly, and that if they were to
 move them alike they would be alike understood. As to this argument,
 I leave the decision to experiment; make a man speak to you gently
 and note [the motion of] his lips.
