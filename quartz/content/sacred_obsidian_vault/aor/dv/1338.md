 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> Notes about events observed abroad (1338-1339).</font></span>I have seen motions of the air so furious that they have carried,
 mixed up in their course, the largest trees of the forest and whole
 roofs of great palaces, and I have seen the same fury bore a hole
 with a whirling movement digging out a gravel pit, and carrying
 gravel, sand and water more than half a mile through the air.

 <p><a name="fn_363"></a><a href="1338.htm#fr_363">394:669</a> : The first sixteen lines of this passage which treat of
 the subject as indicated on the title line have no place in this
 connexion and have been omitted.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_364"></a><a href="1338.htm#fr_364">394:670</a>  2: <i>Ho veduto movimenti</i> &amp;c Nothing of the kind happened
 in Italy during Leonardo's lifetime, and it is therefore extremely
 probable that this refers to the natural phenomena which are so
 fully described in the foregoing passage. (Compare too, No. 1021.)
 There can be no doubt that the descriptions of the Deluge in the
 Libro di Pittura (Vol. I, No. 607-611), and that of the fall of a
 mountain No. 610, l. 17-30 were written from the vivid impressions
 derived from personal experience. Compare also <a href="dv20952.htm#img_pl034">Pl. XXXIV</a>-XL.</p>
