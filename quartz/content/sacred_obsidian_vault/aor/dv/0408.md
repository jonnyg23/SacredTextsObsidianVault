 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> The forms of trees (408--411).</font></span>The elm always gives a greater length to the last branches of the
 year's growth than to the lower ones; and Nature does this because
 the highest branches are those which have to add to the size of the
 tree; and those at the bottom must get dry because they grow in the
 shade and their growth would be an impediment to the entrance of the
 solar rays and the air among the main branches of the tree.
 </p><p>
 The main branches of the lower part bend down more than those above,
 so as to be more oblique than those upper ones, and also because
 they are larger and older.
