 <p>
 The eye which turns from a white object in the light of the sun and
 goes into a less fully lighted place will see everything as dark.
 And this happens either because the pupils of the eyes which have
 rested on this brilliantly lighted white object have contracted so
 much that, given at first a certain extent of surface, they will
 have lost more than 3/4 of their size; and, lacking in size, they
 are also deficient in [seeing] power. Though you might say to me: A
 little bird (then) coming down would see comparatively little, and
 from the smallness of his pupils the white might seem black! To this
 I should reply that here we must have regard to the proportion of
 the mass of that portion of the brain which is given up to the sense
 of sight and to nothing else. Or--to return--this pupil in Man
 dilates and contracts according to the brightness or darkness of
 (surrounding) objects; and since it takes some time to dilate and
 contract, it cannot see immediately on going out of the light and
 into the shade, nor, in the same way, out of the shade into the
 light, and this very thing has already deceived me in painting an
 eye, and from that I learnt it.
