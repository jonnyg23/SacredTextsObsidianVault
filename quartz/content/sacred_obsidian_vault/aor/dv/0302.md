 When the smoke from dry wood is seen between the eye of the
 spectator and some dark space [or object], it will look blue. Thus
 the sky looks blue by reason of the darkness beyond it. And if you
 look towards the horizon of the sky, you will see the atmosphere

 <p>is not blue, and this is caused by its density. And thus at each
 degree, as you raise your eyes above the horizon up to the sky over
 your head, you will see the atmosphere look darker [blue] and this
 is because a smaller density of air lies between your eye and the
 [outer] darkness. And if you go to the top of a high mountain the
 sky will look proportionately darker above you as the atmosphere
 becomes rarer between you and the [outer] darkness; and this will be
 more visible at each degree of increasing height till at last we
 should find darkness.
 </p><p>
 That smoke will look bluest which rises from the driest wood and
 which is nearest to the fire and is seen against the darkest
 background, and with the sunlight upon it.
