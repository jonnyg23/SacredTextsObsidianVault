 </p><h3 align="CENTER">HOW TO REPRESENT A TEMPEST.</h3>
 <p>
 If you wish to represent a tempest consider and arrange well its
 effects as seen, when the wind, blowing over the face of the sea and
 earth, removes and carries with it such things as are not fixed to
 the general mass. And to represent the storm accurately you must
 first show the clouds scattered and torn, and flying with the wind,
 accompanied by clouds of sand blown up from the sea shore, and
 boughs and leaves swept along by the strength and fury of the blast
 and scattered with other light objects through the air. Trees and
 plants must be bent to the ground, almost as if they would follow
 the course of the gale, with their branches twisted out of their
 natural growth and their leaves tossed and turned about  <a name="fr_281"></a><a href="#fn_281"><font size="1">279</font></a>
 . Of the men who are there some must have
 fallen to the ground and be entangled in their garments, and hardly
 to be recognized for the dust, while those who remain standing may
 be behind some tree, with their arms round it that the wind may not
 tear them away; others with their hands over their eyes for the
 dust, bending to the ground with their clothes and hair streaming in
 the wind.  <a name="fr_282"></a><a href="#fn_282"><font size="1">280</font></a>
 
 Let the sea be rough and tempestuous and full of foam whirled among
 the lofty waves, while the wind flings the lighter spray through the
 stormy air, till it resembles a dense and swathing mist. Of the
 ships that are

 <p>therein some should be shown with rent sails and the
 tatters fluttering through the air, with ropes broken and masts
 split and fallen. And the ship itself lying in the trough of the sea
 and wrecked by the fury of the waves with the men shrieking and
 clinging to the fragments of the vessel. Make the clouds driven by
 the impetuosity of the wind and flung against the lofty mountain
 tops, and wreathed and torn like waves beating upon rocks; the air
 itself terrible from the deep darkness caused by the dust and fog
 and heavy clouds.
