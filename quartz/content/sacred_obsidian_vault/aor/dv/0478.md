 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> On images reflected in water.</font></span>Painters often deceive themselves, by representing water in which
 they make the water reflect the objects seen by the man. But the
 water reflects the object from one side and the man sees it from the
 other; and it often happens that the painter sees an object from
 below, and thus one and the same object is seen from hind part
 before and upside down, because the water shows the image of the
 object in one way, and the eye sees it in another.
