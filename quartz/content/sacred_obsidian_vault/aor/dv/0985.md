 In this work you have first to prove that the shells at a thousand
 braccia of elevation were not carried there by the deluge, because
 they are seen to be all at one level, and many mountains are seen to
 be above that level; and to inquire whether the deluge was caused by
 rain or by the swelling of the sea; and then you must show how,
 neither by rain nor by swelling of the rivers, nor by the overflow
 of this sea, could the shells--being heavy objects--be floated up
 the mountains by the sea, nor have carried there by the rivers
 against the course of their waters.
