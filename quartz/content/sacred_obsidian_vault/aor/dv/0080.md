 It is impossible that the line should intersect itself; that is,
 that its right should cross over to its left side, and so, its left
 side become its right side. Because such

 an intersection demands two
 lines, one from each side; for there can be no motion from right to
 left or from left to right in itself without such extension and
 thickness as admit of such motion. And if there is extension it is
 no longer a line but a surface, and we are investigating the
 properties of a line, and not of a surface. And as the line, having
 no centre of thickness cannot be divided, we must conclude that the
 line can have no sides to intersect each other. This is proved by
 the movement of the line <i>a f</i> to <i>a b</i> and of the line <i>e b</i> to <i>e
 f</i>, which are the sides of the surface <i>a f e b</i>. But if you move
 the line <i>a b</i> and the line <i>e f</i>, with the frontends <i>a e</i>, to the
 spot <i>c</i>, you will have moved the opposite ends <i>f b</i> towards each
 other at the point <i>d</i>. And from the two lines you will have drawn
 the straight line <i>c d</i> which cuts the middle of the intersection of
 these two lines at the point <i>n</i> without any intersection. For, you
 imagine these two lines as having breadth, it is evident that by
 this motion the first will entirely cover the other--being equal
 with it--without any intersection, in the position <i>c d</i>. And this
 is sufficient to prove our proposition.
