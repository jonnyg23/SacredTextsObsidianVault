 When you draw the nude always sketch the whole figure and then
 finish those limbs which seem to you the best, but make them act
 with the other limbs; otherwise you will get a habit of never
 putting the limbs well together on the body.
 </p><p>
 Never make the head turn the same way as the torso, nor the arm and
 leg move together on the same side. And if the face is turned to the
 right shoulder, make all the parts lower on the left side than on
 the right; and when you turn the body with the breast outwards, if
 the head turns to the left side make the parts on the right side
 higher than those on the left.

 <p><a name="fn_278"></a><a href="0596.htm#fr_278">299:276</a> : In the original MS. a much defaced sketch is to be seen
 by the side of the second part of this chapter; its faded condition
 has rendered reproduction impossible. In M. RAVAISSON'S facsimile
 the outlines of the head have probably been touched up. This passage
 however is fitly illustrated by the drawings on <a href="pl021.htm#img_pl021">Pl. XXI</a>.</p>
