 <p><a name="fn_490"></a><a href="1466.htm#fr_490">441:796</a> : 4. <i>Lorenzo</i>. See No. 1351, l. 10 (p. 408). Amoretti
 gives the following note in <i>Mem. Stor. XXIII:</i> 1505.
 <i>Martedi-sera a di 14 d'aprile. Venne Lorenzo a stare
 con mecho: disse essere d'eta d'anni 17 .. a di 15 del
 detto aprile ebbi scudi 25 d'oro dal chamerlingo di Santa
 Maria nuova.</i> This, he asserts is derived from a MS.
 marked S, in quarto. This MS. seems to have
 vanished and left no trace behind; Amoretti himself
 had not seen it, but copied from a selection of
 extracts made by Oltrocchi before the Leonardo
 MSS. were conveyed to Paris on the responsibility
 of the first French Republic. Lorenzo, by this, must
 have been born in 1487. The sculptor Lorenzetto
 was born in 1490. Amoretti has been led by the
 above passage to make the following absurd observations:
 </p><p>
 <i>Cotesto Lorenzo, che poi gli fu sempre compagno, almeno
 sin che stette in Italia, sarebb' egli Lorenzo Lotto
 bergamasco? Sappiamo essere stato questo valente dipintore
 uno de' bravi scolari del Vinci</i> (?).
 </p><p>
 <i>Il Fafoia</i>, perhaps a nickname. Cesare da Sesto,
 Leonardo's pupil, seems to have been in Rome in these
 years, as we learn from a drawing by him in the Louvre.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_491"></a><a href="1466.htm#fr_491">441:797</a> : 1466. This seems to be an account for two assistants.
 The name of the second is scarcely legible.
 The year is not given. The note is nevertheless of
 chronological value. The first line tells us the date
 when the note was registered, January 3d, and the
 observations that follow refer to events of the previous month 'of last year' (dell' anno passato). Leonardo
 cannot therefore have written thus in Florence where
 the year was, at that period, calculated as beginning
 in the month of March (see Vol. I, No. 4, note 2).
 He must then have been in Milan. What is more
 important is that we thus learn how to date the
 beginning of the year in all the notes written at
 Milan. This clears up Uzielli's doubts: A Milano
 facevasi cominciar l'anno ab incarnatione, cioe il 25
 Marzo e a nativitate, cioe il 25 Decembre. Ci sembra
 probabile che Leonardo dovesse prescegliere lo stile che era in uso a Firenze. (Ricerche, p. 84, note.)</p>
