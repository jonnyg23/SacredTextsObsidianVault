 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> On reverberation.</font></span><p>
 Reverberation is caused by bodies of a bright nature with a flat and
 semi opaque surface which, when the light strikes upon them, throw
 it back again, like the rebound of a ball, to the former object.

 </p><h3 align="CENTER">WHERE THERE CAN BE NO REFLECTED LIGHTS.</h3>
 <p>
 All dense bodies have their surfaces occupied by various degrees of
 light and shade. The lights are of two kinds, one called original,
 the other borrowed. Original light is that which is inherent in the
 flame of fire or the light of the sun or of the atmosphere. Borrowed
 light will be reflected light; but to return to the promised
 definition: I say that this luminous reverberation is not produced
 by those portions of a body which are turned towards darkened
 objects, such as shaded spots, fields with grass of various height,
 woods whether green or bare; in which, though that side of each
 branch which is turned towards the original light has a share of
 that light, nevertheless the shadows cast by each branch separately
 are so numerous, as well as those cast by one branch on the others,
 that finally so much shadow is the result that the light counts for
 nothing. Hence objects of this kind cannot throw any reflected light
 on opposite objects.
