 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF TREES IN THE EAST.</h3>
 <p>
 When the sun is in the East the trees seen towards the East will
 have the light which surrounds them all round their shadows,
 excepting on the side towards the earth; unless the tree has been
 pruned [below] in the past year. And the trees to the South and
 North will be half in shade and half in light, and more or less in
 shade or in light in proportion as they are more or less to the East
 or to the West.
 </p><p>
 The [position of] the eye above or below varies the shadows and
 lights in trees, inasmuch as the eye placed above sees the tree with
 the little shadow, and the eye placed below with a great deal of
 shadow.
 </p><p>
 The colour of the green in plants varies as much as their species.
