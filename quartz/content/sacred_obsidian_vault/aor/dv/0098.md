 <p>
 No second object can be so much lower than the first as that the eye
 will not see it higher than the first, if the eye is above the
 second.
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">PERSPECTIVE.</h3>
 <p>
 And this second object will never be so much higher than the first
 as that the eye, being below them, will not see the second as lower
 than the first.
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">PERSPECTIVE.</h3>
 <p>
 If the eye sees a second square through the centre of a smaller one,
 that is nearer, the second, larger square will appear to be
 surrounded by the smaller one.

 </p><h3 align="CENTER">PERSPECTIVE--PROPOSITION.</h3>
 <p>
 Objects that are farther off can never be so large but that those in
 front, though smaller, will conceal or surround them.

 </p><h3 align="CENTER">DEFINITION.</h3>
 <p>
 This proposition can be proved by experiment. For if you look
 through a small hole there is nothing so large that it cannot be
 seen through it and the object so seen appears surrounded and
 enclosed by the outline of the sides of the hole. And if you stop it
 up, this small stopping will conceal the view of the largest object.
