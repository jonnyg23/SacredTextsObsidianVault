 <p>
 If you place two lighted candles side by side half a braccio apart,
 and go from them to a distance 200 braccia you will see that by the
 increased size of each they will appear as a single luminous body
 with the light of the two flames, one braccio wide.

 </p><h3 align="CENTER">TO PROVE HOW YOU MAY SEE THE REAL SIZE OF LUMINOUS BODIES.</h3>
 <p>
 If you wish to see the real size of these luminous bodies, take a
 very thin board and make in it a hole no bigger than the tag of a
 lace and place it as close to your eye as possible, so that when you
 look through this hole, at the said light, you can see a large space
 of air round it. Then by rapidly moving this board backwards and
 forwards before your eye you will see the light increase [and
 diminish].
