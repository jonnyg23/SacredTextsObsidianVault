 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> The tide in estuaries.</font></span>Book 9, of the meeting of rivers and of their ebb and flow. The
 cause is the same in the sea, where it is caused by the straits of
 Gibraltar; and again it is caused by whirlpools.
 </p><p>
 [3] If two rivers meet together to form a straight line, and then
 below two right angles take their course together, the flow and ebb
 will happen now in one river and now in the other above their
 confluence, and principally if the outlet for their united volume is
 no swifter than when they were separate. Here occur 4 instances.
