 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> The effects of midday light.</font></span>To represent a landscape choose that the sun shall be at noon and
 look towards the West or East and then draw. And if you turn towards
 the North, every object placed on that side will have no shadow,
 particularly those which are nearest to the [direction of the]
 shadow of your head. And if you turn towards the South every object
 on that side will be wholly in shadow. All the trees which are
 towards the sun and have the atmosphere for their background are
 dark, and the other trees which lie against that darkness will be
 black [very dark] in the middle and lighter towards the edges.
