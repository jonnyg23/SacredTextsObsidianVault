 Again, a man has even a greater store of strength in his legs than
 he needs for his own weight; and to see if this is true, make a man
 stand on the shore-sand and then put another man on his back, and
 you will see how much he will sink in. Then take the man from off
 his back and make him jump straight up as high as he can, and you
 will find that the print of his feet will be made deeper by the jump
 than from having the man on his back. Hence, here, by 2 methods it
 is proved that a man has double the strength he requires to support
 his own body.
