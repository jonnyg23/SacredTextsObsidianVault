 <p>
 When you draw a figure and you wish to see whether the shadow is the
 proper complement to the light, and neither redder nor yellower than
 is the nature of the colour you wish to represent in shade, proceed
 thus. Cast a shadow with your finger on the illuminated portion, and
 if the accidental shadow that you have made is like the natural
 shadow cast by your finger on your work, well and good; and by
 putting your finger nearer or farther off, you can make darker or
 lighter shadows, which you must compare with your own.
