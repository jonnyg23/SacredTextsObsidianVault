 Very excellent will be a stiff white paper, made of the usual
 mixture and filtered milk of an herb called calves foot; and when
 this paper is prepared and damped and folded and wrapped up it may

 covered with stiff transparent white and <i>sardonio</i> and then damped

 several times in the spaces between the pieces, each time pouring in
 first some black and then some stiff white and each time leaving it
 to dry; then smooth it and polish it.
