 <p><a name="fn_84"></a><a href="0802.htm#fr_84">112:418</a> : <i>Cresciere l'omo</i>. The meaning of this expression appears
 to be different here and in the passage C.A. 157a, 468a (see No.
 526, Note 1. 2). Here it can hardly mean anything else than
 modelling, since the sculptor forms the figure by degrees, by adding
 wet clay and the figure consequently increases or grows. <i>Tu farai
 la statua</i> would then mean, you must work out the figure in marble.
 If this interpretation is the correct one, this passage would have
 no right to find a place in the series on anatomical studies. I may
 say that it was originally inserted in this connection under the
 impression that <i>di cresciere</i> should be read <i>descrivere</i>.</p>
