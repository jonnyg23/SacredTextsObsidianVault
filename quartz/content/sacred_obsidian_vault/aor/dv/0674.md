 hemisphere, in the form of a world; on which let there be a peacock,
 richly decorated, and with his tail spread over the group; and every
 ornament belonging to the horse should be of peacock's feathers on a
 gold ground, to signify the beauty which comes of the grace bestowed
 on him who is a good servant.

 On the opposite side will be represented Fortitude, in like manner
 in her place with her pillar in her hand, robed in white, to signify
 ... And all crowned; and Prudence with 3 eyes. The housing of the
 horse should be of plain cloth of gold closely sprinkled with
 peacock's eyes, and this holds good for all the housings of the
 horse, and the man's dress. And the man's crest and his neck-chain
 are of peacock's feathers on golden ground.

 On the left side will be a wheel, the centre of which should be
 attached to the centre of the horse's hinder thigh piece, and in the
 centre Prudence is seen robed in red, Charity sitting in a

 <p><a name="fn_311"></a><a href="0674.htm#fr_311">352:309</a> : <i>Messer Antonio Gri</i>. His name thus abbreviated is, there
 can be no doubt, Grimani. Antonio Grimani was the famous Doge who in
 1499 commanded the Venetian fleet in battle against the Turks. But
 after the abortive conclusion of the expedition--Ludovico being the
 ally of the Turks who took possession of Friuli--, Grimani was driven
 into exile; he went to live at Rome with his son Cardinal Domenico
 Grimani. On being recalled to Venice he filled the office of Doge
 from 1521 to 1523. <i>Antonio Maria</i> probably means Antonio Maria
 Grimani, the Patriarch of Aquileia.</p>
