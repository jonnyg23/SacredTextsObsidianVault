 For a long time the water of the Mediterranean flowed out through
 the Red Sea, which is 100 miles wide and 1500 long, and full of
 reefs; and it has worn away the sides of Mount Sinai, a fact which
 testifies, not to an inundation from the Indian sea beating on these
 coasts, but to a deluge of water which carried with it all the
 rivers which abound round the Mediterranean, and besides this there
 is the reflux of the sea; and then, a cutting being made to the West
 3000 miles away from this place, Gibraltar was separated from Ceuta,
 which had been joined to it. And this passage was cut very low down,
 in the plains between Gibraltar and the ocean at the foot of the
 mountain, in the low part, aided by the hollowing out of some
 valleys made by certain rivers, which might have flowed here.

  came to open the sea to the
 westward and then the sea waters began to pour into the Western
 Ocean; and in consequence of this great fall, the Red Sea remained
 the higher; whence the water, abandoning its course here, ever after
 poured away through the Straits of Spain.

 jestingly and only in order to suggest to the reader an allusion to
 the legend of the pillars of Hercules.</p>
