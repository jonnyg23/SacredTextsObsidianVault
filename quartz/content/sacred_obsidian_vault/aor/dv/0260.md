 <p>
 The foregoing proposition can be clearly proved in this way. Let us
 say that <i>m q</i> is the luminous body, then <i>f g</i> will be the opaque

 <p>body; and let <i>a e</i> be the above-mentioned plane on which the said
 angles fall, showing [plainly] the nature and character of their
 bases. Then: <i>a</i> will be more luminous than <i>b</i>; the base of the
 angle <i>a</i> is larger than that of <i>b</i> and it therefore makes a
 greater angle which will be <i>a m q</i>; and the pyramid <i>b p m</i> will be
 narrower and <i>m o c</i> will be still finer, and so on by degrees, in
 proportion as they are nearer to <i>e</i>, the pyramids will become
 narrower and darker. That portion of the wall will be the darkest
 where the breadth of the

 <p>pyramid of shadow is greater than the
 breadth of the pyramid of light.
 </p><p>
 At the point <i>a</i> the pyramid of light is equal in strength to the
 pyramid of shadow, because the base <i>f g</i> is equal to the base <i>r
 f</i>. At the point <i>d</i> the pyramid of light is narrower than the
 pyramid of shadow by so much as the base <i>s f</i> is less than the base
 <i>f g</i>.
 </p><p>
 Divide the foregoing proposition into two diagrams, one with the
 pyramids of light and shadow, the other with the pyramids of light
 [only].
