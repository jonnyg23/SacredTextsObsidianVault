 <p><a name="fn_239"></a><a href="1054.htm#fr_239">244:573</a> : This passage evidently refers to the making
 of maps, such as <a href="pl112.htm#img_pl112">Pl. CXII</a>, <a href="pl093.htm#img_pl093">CXIII</a>, and <a href="pl094.htm#img_pl094">CXIV</a>. There is no mention of
 such works, it is true, excepting in this one passage of MS. L. But
 this can scarcely be taken as evidence against my view that Leonardo
 busied himself very extensively at that time in the construction of
 maps; and all the less since the foregoing chapters clearly prove
 that at a time so full of events Leonardo would only now and then
 commit his observations to paper, in the MS. L.

 By the side of this text we find, in the original, a very indistinct
 sketch, perhaps a plan of a position. Instead of this drawing I have
 here inserted a much clearer sketch of a position from the same MS.,
 L. 82b and 83a. They are the only drawings of landscape, it may be
 noted, which occur at all in that MS.</p>
