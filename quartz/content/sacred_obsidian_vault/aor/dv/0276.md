 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF THE COLOURS OF SIMPLE DERIVED SHADOWS.</h3>
 <p>
 The colour of derived shadows is always affected by that of the body
 towards which they are cast. To prove this: let an opaque body be
 placed between the plane <i>s c t d</i> and the blue light <i>d e</i> and the
 red light <i>a b</i>, then I say that <i>d e</i>, the blue light, will fall on
 the whole surface <i>s c t d</i> excepting at <i>o p</i> which is covered by
 the shadow of the body <i>q r</i>, as is shown by the straight lines <i>d q
 o e r p</i>. And the same occurs with the light <i>a b</i> which falls on
 the whole surface <i>s c t d</i> excepting at the spot obscured by the
 shadow <i>q r</i>; as is shown by the lines <i>d q o</i>, and <i>e r p</i>. Hence
 we may conclude that the shadow <i>n m</i> is exposed to the blue light
 </p><p><a name="page_149"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 149</font></a></p>
 <p><i>d e</i>; but, as the red light <i>a b</i> cannot fall there, <i>n m</i> will
 appear as a blue shadow on a red background tinted with blue,
 because on the surface <i>s c t d</i> both lights can fall. But in the
 shadows only one single light falls; for this reason these shadows
 are of medium depth, since, if no light whatever mingled with the
 shadow, it would be of the first degree of darkness &amp;c But in the
 shadow at <i>o p</i> the blue light does not fall, because the body <i>q r</i>
 interposes and intercepts it there. Only the red light <i>a b</i> falls
 there and tinges the shadow of a red hue and so a ruddy shadow
 appears on the background of mingled red and blue.
 </p><p>
 The shadow of <i>q r</i> at <i>o p</i> is red, being caused by the blue light
 <i>d e</i>; and the shadow of <i>q r</i> at <i>o' p'</i> is blue being caused by
 the red light <i>a b</i>. Hence we say that the blue light in this
 instance causes a red derived shadow from the opaque body <i>q' r'</i>,
 while the red light causes the same body to cast a blue derived
 shadow; but the primary shadow [on the dark side of the body itself]
 is not of either of those hues, but a mixture of red and blue.
 </p><p>
 The derived shadows will be equal in depth if they are produced by
 lights of equal strength and at an equal distance; this is proved.

 circle <i>q r corpo obroso</i> (body in shadow); at the spot marked <i>A,
 luminoso azzurro</i> (blue luminous body); at <i>B, luminoso rosso</i> (red
 luminous body). At <i>E</i> we read <i>ombra azzurra</i> (blue tinted shadow)
 and at <i>D ombra rossa</i> (red tinted shadow).</p>
