 <p>
 A nut, having been carried by a crow to the top of a tall campanile
 and released by falling into a chink from the mortal grip of its
 beak, it prayed the wall by the grace bestowed on it by God in
 allowing it to be so high and thick, and to own such fine bells and
 of so noble a tone, that it would succour it, and that, as it had
 not been able to fall under the verdurous boughs of its venerable
 father and lie in the fat earth covered up by his fallen leaves it
 would not abandon it; because, finding itself in the beak of the
 cruel crow, it had there made a vow that if it escaped from her it
 would end its life in a little hole. At these words the wall, moved
 to compassion, was content to shelter it in the spot where it had
 fallen; and after a short time the nut began to split open and put
 forth roots between the rifts of the stones and push them apart, and
 to throw out shoots from its hollow shell; and, to be brief, these
 rose above the building and the twisted roots, growing thicker,
 began to thrust the walls apart, and tear out the ancient stones
 from their old places. Then the wall too late and in vain bewailed
 the cause of its destruction and in a short time, it wrought the
 ruin of a great part of it.
