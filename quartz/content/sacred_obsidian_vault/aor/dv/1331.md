 The circular plans of carrying earth are very useful, inasmuch as
 men never stop in their work; and it is done in many ways. By one of
 these ways men carry the earth on their shoulders, by another in
 chests and others on wheelbarrows. The man who carries it on his
 shoulders first fills the tub on the ground, and he loses time in
 hoisting it on to his shoulders. He with the chests loses no time.
