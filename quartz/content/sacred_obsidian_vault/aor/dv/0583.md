 <p>
 Old men ought to be represented with slow and heavy movements, their
 legs bent at the knees, when they stand still, and their feet placed
 parallel and apart; bending low with the head leaning forward, and
 their arms but little extended.
 </p><p>
 Women must be represented in modest attitudes, their legs close
 together, their arms closely folded, their heads inclined and
 somewhat on one side.
 </p><p>
 Old women should be represented with eager, swift and furious
 gestures, like infernal furies; but the action should be more
 violent in their arms and head than in their legs.
 </p><p>
 Little children, with lively and contorted movements when sitting,
 and, when standing still, in shy and timid attitudes.

 <p><a name="fn_273"></a><a href="0583.htm#fr_273">291:271</a> : <i>bracci raccolte</i>. Compare <a href="pl033.htm#img_pl033">Pl. XXXIII</a>. This drawing, in
 silver point on yellowish tinted paper, the lights heightened with
 white, represents two female hands laid together in a lap. Above is
 a third finished study of a right hand, apparently holding a veil
 from the head across the bosom. This drawing evidently dates from
 before 1500 and was very probably done at Florence, perhaps as a
 preparatory study for some picture. The type of hand with its
 slender thin forms is more like the style of the <i>Vierge aux
 Rochers</i> in the Louvre than any later works--as the Mona Lisa for
 instance.</p>
