 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> Of mining.</font></span>If you want to know where a mine runs, place a drum over all the
 places where you suspect that it is being made, and upon this drum
 put a couple of dice, and when you are over the spot where they are
 mining, the dice will jump a little on the drum at every blow which
 is given underground in the mining.
 </p><p>
 There are persons who, having the convenience of a river or a lake
 in their lands, have made, close to the place where they suspect
 that a mine is being made, a great reservoir of water, and have
 countermined the enemy, and having found them, have turned the water
 upon them and destroyed a great number in the mine.
