 The highest good is wisdom, the chief
 evil is suffering in the body. Because, as
 we are composed of two things, that is soul
 and body, of which the first is the better,
 the body is the inferior; wisdom belongs
 to the better part, and the chief evil belongs
 to the worse part and is the worst of all.
 As the best thing of all in the soul is
 wisdom, so the worst in the body is suf-
 fering. Therefore just as bodily pain is the
 chief evil, wisdom is the chief good of the
 soul, that is with the wise man; and nothing
 else can be compared with it.
