 A shadow is never seen as of uniform depth on the surface which
 intercepts it unless every portion of that surface is equidistant
 from the luminous body. This is proved by the 7th which says:--The
 shadow will appear lighter or stronger as it is surrounded by a
 darker or a lighter background. And by the 8th of this:--The
 background will be in parts darker or lighter, in proportion as it
 is farther from or nearer to the luminous body. And:--Of various
 spots equally distant from the luminous body those will always be in
 the highest light on which the rays fall at the smallest angles: The
 outline of the shadow as it falls on inequalities in the surface
 will be seen with all the contours similar to those of the body that
 casts it, if the eye is placed just where the centre of the light
 was.
 </p><p>
 The shadow will look darkest where it is farthest from the body that
 casts it. The shadow <i>c d</i>, cast by the body in shadow <i>a b</i> which
 is equally distant in all parts, is not of equal depth because it is
 seen on a back ground of varying brightness.  <a name="fr_95"></a><a href="#fn_95"><font size="1">93</font></a>
