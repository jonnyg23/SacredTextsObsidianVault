 <p>
 Although the points of luminous pyramids may extend into shaded
 places and those of pyramids of shadow into illuminated places, and
 though among the luminous pyramids one may start from a broader base
 than another; nevertheless, if by reason of their various length
 these luminous pyramids acquire angles of equal size their light
 will be equal; and the case will be the same with the pyramids of
 shadow; as may be seen in the intersected pyramids <i>a b c</i> and <i>d e
 f</i>, which though their bases differ in size are equal as to breadth
 and light.
