 I wish to work miracles;--it may be that I shall possess less than
 other men of more peaceful lives, or than those who want to grow
 rich in a day. I may live for a long time in great poverty, as
 always happens, and to all eternity will happen, to alchemists, the
 would-be creators of gold and silver, and to engineers who would
 have dead water stir itself into life and perpetual motion, and to
 those supreme fools, the necromancer and the enchanter.

 And you, who say that it would be better to watch an anatomist at
 work than to see these drawings, you would be right, if it were
 possible to observe all the things which are demonstrated in such
 drawings in a single figure, in which you, with all your cleverness,
 will not see nor obtain knowledge of more than some few veins, to
 obtain a true and perfect knowledge of which I have dissected more
 than ten human bodies, destroying
 </p><p><a name="page_108"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 108</font></a></p>
 <p>all the other members, and
 removing the very minutest particles of the flesh by which these
 veins are surrounded, without causing them to bleed, excepting the
 insensible bleeding of the capillary veins; and as one single body
 would not last so long, since it was necessary to proceed with
 several bodies by degrees, until I came to an end and had a complete
 knowledge; this I repeated twice, to learn the differences [59].

 And if you should have a love for such things you might be prevented
 by loathing, and if that did not prevent you, you might be deterred
 by the fear of living in the night hours in the company of those
 corpses, quartered and flayed and horrible to see. And if this did
 not prevent you, perhaps you might not be able to draw so well as is
 necessary for such a demonstration; or, if you had the skill in
 drawing, it might not be combined with knowledge of perspective; and
 if it were so, you might not understand the methods of geometrical
 demonstration and the method of the calculation of forces and of the
 strength of the muscles; patience also may be wanting, so that you
 lack perseverance. As to whether all these things were found in me
 or not  <a name="fr_81"></a><a href="#fn_81"><font size="1">415</font></a>
 , the hundred and
 twenty books composed by me will give verdict Yes or No. In these I
 have been hindered neither by avarice nor negligence, but simply by
 want of time. Farewell [89].

 <p><a name="fn_79"></a><a href="0796.htm#fr_79">107:413</a>  23: The following seems to be directed against students of
 painting and young artists rather than against medical men and
 anatomists.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_80"></a><a href="0796.htm#fr_80">108:414</a> : Lines 1-59 and 60-89 are written in two parallel columns.
 When we here find Leonardo putting himself in the same category as
 the Alchemists and Necromancers, whom he elsewhere mocks at so
 bitterly, it is evidently meant ironically. In the same way
 Leonardo, in the introduction to the Books on Perspective sets
 himself with transparent satire on a level with other writers on the
 subject.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_81"></a><a href="0796.htm#fr_81">108:415</a>  84: Leonardo frequently, and perhaps habitually,
 wrote in note books of a very small size and only moderately thick;
 in most of those which have been preserved undivided, each contains
 less than fifty leaves. Thus a considerable number of such volumes
 must have gone to make up a volume of the bulk of the '<i>Codex
 Atlanticus</i>' which now contains nearly 1200 detached leaves. In the
 passage under consideration, which was evidently written at a late
 period of his life, Leonardo speaks of his Manuscript note-books as
 numbering 12O; but we should hardly be justified in concluding from
 this passage that the greater part of his Manuscripts were now
 missing (see <i>Prolegomena</i>, Vol. I, pp. 5-7).</p>
