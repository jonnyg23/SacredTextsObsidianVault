 That the shores of the sea constantly acquire more soil towards the
 middle of the sea; that the rocks and promontories of the sea are
 constantly being ruined and worn away; that the Mediterranean seas
 will in time discover their bottom to the air, and all that will be
 left will be the channel of the greatest river that enters it; and
 this will run to the ocean and pour its waters into that with those
 of all the rivers that are its tributaries.
