 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> Of sketching figures and portraits (571-572).</font></span>When you have well learnt perspective and have by heart the parts
 and forms of objects, you must go about, and constantly, as you go,
 observe, note and consider the circumstances and behaviour of men in
 talking, quarrelling or laughing or fighting together: the action of
 the men themselves and the actions of the bystanders, who separate
 them or who look on. And take a note of them with slight strokes
 thus, in a little book which you should always carry with you. And
 it should be of tinted paper, that it may not be rubbed out, but
 change the old [when full] for a new one; since these things should
 not be rubbed out but preserved with great care; for the forms, and
 positions of objects are so infinite that the memory is incapable of
 retaining them, wherefore keep these [sketches] as your guides and
 masters.

 <p><a name="fn_266"></a><a href="0571.htm#fr_266">287:264</a> : Among Leonardo's numerous note books of pocket size not
 one has coloured paper, so no sketches answering to this description
 can be pointed out. The fact that most of the notes are written in
 ink, militates against the supposition that they were made in the
 open air.</p>
