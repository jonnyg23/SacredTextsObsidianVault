 </p><h3 align="CENTER">WHY GROUPS OF FIGURES ONE ABOVE ANOTHER ARE TO BE AVOIDED.</h3>
 <p>
 The universal practice which painters adopt on the walls of chapels
 is greatly and reasonably to be condemned. Inasmuch as they
 represent one historical subject on one level with a landscape and
 buildings, and then go up a step and paint another, varying the
 point [of sight], and then a third and a fourth, in such a way as
 that on one wall there are 4 points of sight, which is supreme folly
 in such painters. We know that the
 </p><p><a name="page_271"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 271</font></a></p>
 <p>point of sight is opposite the
 eye of the spectator of the scene; and if you would [have me] tell
 you how to represent the life of a saint divided into several
 pictures on one and the same wall, I answer that you must set out
 the foreground with its point of sight on a level with the eye of
 the spectator of the scene, and upon this plane represent the more
 important part of the story large and then, diminishing by degrees
 the figures, and the buildings on various hills and open spaces, you
 can represent all the events of the history. And on the remainder of
 the wall up to the top put trees, large as compared with the
 figures, or angels if they are appropriate to the story, or birds or
 clouds or similar objects; otherwise do not trouble yourself with it
 for your whole work will be wrong.
