 Mem.: That I must first show the distance of the sun from the earth;
 and, by means of a ray passing through a small hole into a dark
 chamber, detect its real size; and besides this, by means of the
 aqueous sphere calculate the size of the globe ...
 </p><p>
 Here it will be shown, that when the sun is in the meridian of our
 hemisphere  <a name="fr_110"></a><a href="#fn_110"><font size="1">444</font></a>
 ,
 the antipodes to the East and to the West, alike, and at the same
 time, see the sun mirrored in their waters; and the same is equally
 true of the arctic and antarctic poles, if indeed they are
 inhabited.

 <p><a name="fn_110"></a><a href="0864.htm#fr_110">139:444</a>  10: <i>Antipodi orientali cogli occidentali</i>. The
 word <i>Antipodes</i> does not here bear its literal sense, but--as we
 may infer from the simultaneous reference to inhabitants of the
 North and South-- is used as meaning men living at a distance of 90
 degrees from the zenith of the rational horizon of each observer.</p>
