 </p><h3 align="CENTER">THE ACTION OF THE LIGHT AS FROM ITS CENTRE.</h3>
 <p>
 If it were the whole of the light that caused the shadows beyond the
 bodies placed in front of it, it would follow that any body much
 smaller than the light would cast a pyramidal shadow; but experience
 not showing this, it must be the centre of the light that produces
 this effect.

 Let <i>a b</i> be the width of the light from a window, which falls on a
 stick set up at one foot from <i>a c</i>  <a name="fr_86"></a><a href="#fn_86"><font size="1">84</font></a>
 . And let <i>a d</i> be the
 space where all the light from the window is visible. At <i>c e</i> that
 part of the window which is between <i>l b</i> cannot be seen. In the
 same way <i>a m</i> cannot be seen from <i>d f</i> and therefore in these two
 portions the light begins to fail.
