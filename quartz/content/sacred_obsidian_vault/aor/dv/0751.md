 <p><a name="fn_28"></a><a href="0751.htm#fr_28">34:362</a> : This passage was first published by AMORETTI in <i>Memorie
 Storiche</i> Cap. X: Una sua opera da riportarsi a quest' anno fu il
 bagno fatto per la duchessa Beatrice nel parco o giardino del
 Castello. Lionardo non solo ne disegno il piccolo edifizio a foggia
 di padiglione, nel cod. segnato Q. 3, dandone anche separatamente la
 pianta; ma sotto vi scrisse: Padiglione del giardino della duchessa;
 e sotto la pianta: Fondamento del padiglione ch'e nel mezzo del
 labirinto del duca di Milano; nessuna data e presso il padiglione,
 disegnato nella pagina 12, ma poco sopra fra molti circoli
 intrecciati vedesi = 10 Luglio 1492 = e nella pagina 2 presso ad
 alcuni disegni di legumi qualcheduno ha letto Settembre 1482 in vece
 di 1492, come dovea scriverevi, e probabilmente scrisse Lionardo.

 The original text however hardly bears the interpretation put upon
 it by AMORETTI. He is mistaken as to the mark on the MS. as well as
 in his statements as to the date, for the MS. in question has no
 date; the date he gives occurs, on the contrary, in another
 note-book. Finally, it appears to me quite an open question whether
 Leonardo was the architect who carried out the construction of the
 dome-like Pavilion here shown in section, or of the ground plan of
 the Pavilion drawn by the side of it. Must we, in fact, suppose that
 "<i>il duca di Milano</i>" here mentioned was, as has been generally
 assumed, Ludovico il Moro? He did not hold this title from the
 Emperor before 1494; till that date he was only called <i>Governatore</i>
 and Leonardo in speaking of him, mentions him generally as "<i>il
 Moro</i>" even after 1494. On January 18, 1491, he married Beatrice
 d'Este the daughter of Ercole I, Duke of Ferrara. She died on the
 2nd January 1497, and for the reasons I have given it seems
 improbable that it should be this princess who is here spoken of as
 the "<i>Duchessa di Milano</i>". From the style of the handwriting it
 appears to me to be beyond all doubt that the MS. B, from which this
 passage is taken, is older than the dated MSS. of 1492 and 1493. In
 that case the Duke of Milan here mentioned would be Gian Galeazzo
 (1469-1494) and the Duchess would be his wife Isabella of Aragon, to
 whom he was married on the second February 1489. J. P. R.</p>
