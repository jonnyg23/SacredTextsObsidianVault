 <p>
 All the lakes and all the gulfs of the sea and all inland seas are
 due to rivers which distribute their waters into them, and from
 impediments in their downfall into the Mediterranean --which divides
 Africa from Europe and Europe from Asia by means of the Nile and the
 Don which pour their waters into it. It is asked what impediment is
 great enough to stop the course of the waters which do not reach the
 ocean.
