 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> On the preparation and use of colours (618-627).</font></span>To make a fine green take green and mix it with bitumen and you will
 make the shadows darker. Then, for lighter [shades] green with
 yellow ochre, and for still lighter green with yellow, and for the
 high lights pure yellow; then mix green and turmeric together and
 glaze every thing with it. To make a fine red take cinnabar or red
 chalk or burnt ochre for the dark shadows and for the lighter ones
 red chalk and vermilion and for the lights pure vermilion and then
 glaze with fine lake. To make good oil for painting. One part of
 oil, one of the first refining and one of the second.
