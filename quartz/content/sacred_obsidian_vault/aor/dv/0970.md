 <h3 align="CENTER">OF THE ORIGIN OF RIVERS.</h3>
 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> On the way in which the sources of rivers are fed.</font></span>The body of the earth, like the bodies of animals, is intersected
 with ramifications of waters which are all in connection and are
 constituted to give nutriment and life to the earth and to its
 creatures. These come from the depth of the sea and, after many
 revolutions, have to return to it by the rivers created by the
 bursting of these springs; and if you chose to say that the rains of
 the winter or the melting of the snows in summer were the cause of
 the birth of rivers, I could mention the rivers which originate in
 the torrid countries of Africa, where it never rains--and still less
 snows--because the intense heat always melts into air all the clouds
 which are borne thither by the winds. And if you chose to say that
 such rivers, as increase in July and August, come from the snows
 which melt in May and June from the sun's approach to the snows on
 the mountains of Scythia  <a name="fr_178"></a><a href="#fn_178"><font size="1">512</font></a>
 , and that such meltings come down into certain valleys and
 form lakes, into which they enter by springs and subterranean

 <p>caves to issue forth again at the sources of the Nile, this is false;
 because Scythia is lower than the sources of the Nile, and, besides,
 Scythia is only 400 miles from the Black sea and the sources of the
 Nile are 3000 miles distant from the sea of Egypt into which its
 waters flow.
