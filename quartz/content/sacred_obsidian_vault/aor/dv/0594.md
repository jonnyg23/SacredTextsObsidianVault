 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF REPRESENTING A MAN SPEAKING TO A MULTITUDE.</h3>
 <p>
 When you wish to represent a man speaking to a number of people,
 consider the matter of which he has to treat and adapt
 </p><p><a name="page_297"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 297</font></a></p>
 <p>his action to
 the subject. Thus, if he speaks persuasively, let his action be
 appropriate to it. If the matter in hand be to set forth an
 argument, let the speaker, with the fingers of the right hand hold
 one finger of the left hand, having the two smaller ones closed; and

 his face alert, and turned towards the people with mouth a little
 open, to look as though he spoke; and if he is sitting let him
 appear as though about to rise, with his head forward. If you
 represent him standing make him leaning slightly forward with body and
 <p><a name="page_298"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 298</font></a></p>
 <p>head towards the people. These you must represent as silent and
 attentive, all looking at the orator's face with gestures of
 admiration; and make some old men in astonishment at the things they
 hear, with the corners of their mouths pulled down and drawn in,
 their cheeks full of furrows, and their eyebrows raised, and
 wrinkling the forehead where they meet. Again, some sitting with
 their fingers clasped holding their weary knees. Again, some bent
 old man, with one knee crossed over the other; on which let him hold
 his hand with his other elbow resting in it and the hand supporting
 his bearded chin.

 <p><a name="fn_276"></a><a href="0594.htm#fr_276">298:274</a> : The sketches introduced here are a facsimile of a pen and
 ink drawing in the Louvre which Herr CARL BRUN considers as studies
 for the Last Supper in the church of <i>Santa Maria delle Grazie</i> (see
 Leonardo da Vinci, LXI, pp. 21, 27 and 28 in DOHME'S <i>Kunst und
 Kunstler</i>, Leipzig, Seemann). I shall not here enter into any
 discussion of this suggestion; but as a justification for
 introducing the drawing in this place, I may point out that some of
 the figures illustrate this passage as perfectly as though they had
 been drawn for that express purpose. I have discussed the
 probability of a connection between this sketch and the picture of
 the Last Supper on p. 335. The original drawing is 27 3/4
 centimetres wide by 21 high.--The drawing in silver point on reddish
 paper given on <a href="pl052.htm#img_pl052">Pl. LII</a>. No. 1--the original at Windsor Castle--may
 also serve to illustrate the subject of appropriate gestures,
 treated in Nos. 593 and 594.</p>
