 I have found in a history of the Spaniards
 that in their wars with the English Archimedes
 of Syracuse who at that time was living
 at the court of Ecliderides, King of the
 Cirodastri. And in maritime warfare he ordered that
 the ships should have tall masts, and that on
 their tops there should be a spar fixed  <a name="fr_532"></a><a href="#fn_532"><font size="1">832</font></a>
  of
 40 feet long and one third of a foot thick. At
 one end of this was a small grappling iron and
 at the other a counterpoise; and there was also
 attached 12 feet of chain; and, at the end of
 this chain, as much rope as would reach from
 the chain to the base of the top, where it was
 fixed with a small rope; from this base it ran
 down to the bottom of the mast where a
 very strong spar was attached and to this
 was fastened the end of the rope. But to go on
 to the use of his machine; I say that below
 this grappling iron was a fire  <a name="fr_533"></a><a href="#fn_533"><font size="1">833</font></a>
  which, with
 tremendous noise, threw down its rays and
 a shower of burning pitch; which, pouring

 men who were in it to abandon the top
 to which the grappling-iron had clung. This
 was hooked on to the edges of the top
 and then suddenly the cord attached at the
 base of the top to support the cord which

 names here mentioned cannot be explained. Leonardo
 seems to quote here from a book, perhaps by some
 questionable mediaeval writer. Prof. C. Justi writes to
 me from Madrid, that Spanish savants have no knowledge
 of the sources from which this story may have
 been derived.</p>
