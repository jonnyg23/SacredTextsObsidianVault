 [If you want to make simple casts quickly, make them in a box of
 river sand wetted with vinegar.]

 [When you shall have made the mould upon the horse you must make the
 thickness of the metal in clay.]
 </p><p>
 Observe in alloying how many hours are wanted for each
 hundredweight. [In casting each one keep the furnace and its fire
 well stopped up.] [Let the inside of all the moulds be wetted with
 linseed oil or oil of turpentine, and then take a handful of
 powdered borax and Greek pitch with aqua vitae, and pitch the mould
 over outside so that being under ground the damp may not [damage
 it?]
 </p><p>
 [To manage the large mould make a model of the small mould, make a
 small room in proportion.]
 </p><p>
 [Make the vents in the mould while it is on the horse.]
 </p><p>
 Hold the hoofs in the tongs, and cast them with fish glue. Weigh the
 parts of the mould and the quantity of metal it will take to fill
 them, and give so much to the furnace that it may afford to each
 part its amount of metal; and this you may know by weighing the clay
 of each part of the mould to which the quantity in the furnace must
 correspond. And this is done in order that the furnace for the legs
 when filled may not have to furnish metal from the legs to help out
 the head, which would be impossible. [Cast at the same casting as
 the horse the little door]

 <h3 align="CENTER">Footnotes</h3>
 <p><a name="fn_1"></a><a href="0710.htm#fr_1">11:335</a> : The importance of the notes included under this number is
 not diminished by the fact that they have been lightly crossed out
 with red chalk. Possibly they were the first scheme for some fuller
 observations which no longer exist; or perhaps they were crossed out
 when Leonardo found himself obliged to give up the idea of casting
 the equestrian statue. In the original the first two sketches are
 above l. 1, and the third below l. 9.</p>
