 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> Necessity of theoretical knowledge (19. 20).</font></span>Those who are in love with practice without knowledge are like the
 sailor who gets into a ship without rudder or compass and who never
 can be certain whether he is going. Practice must always be founded
 on sound theory, and to this Perspective is the guide and the
 gateway; and without this nothing can be done well in the matter of
 drawing.
