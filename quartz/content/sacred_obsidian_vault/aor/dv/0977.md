 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> The origin of the sand in rivers (977. 978).</font></span>A river that flows from mountains deposits a great quantity of large
 stones in its bed, which still have some of their angles and sides,
 and in the course of its flow it carries down smaller stones with
 the angles more worn; that is to say the large stones become
 smaller. And farther on it deposits coarse gravel and then smaller,
 and as it proceeds this becomes coarse sand and then finer, and
 going on thus the water, turbid with sand and gravel, joins the sea;
 and the sand settles on the sea-shores, being cast up by the salt
 waves; and there results the sand of so fine a nature as to seem
 almost like water, and it will not stop on the shores of the sea but
 returns by reason of its lightness, because it was originally formed
 of rotten leaves and other very light things. Still, being
 almost--as was said--of the nature of water itself, it afterwards,
 when the weather is calm, settles and becomes solid at the bottom of
 the sea, where by its fineness it becomes compact and by its
 smoothness resists the waves which glide over it; and in this shells
 are found; and this is white earth, fit for pottery.
