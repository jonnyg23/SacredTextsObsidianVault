 </p><h3 align="CENTER">A COMMON THING.</h3>
 <p>
 A wretched person will be flattered, and these flatterers are always
 the deceivers, robbers and murderers of the wretched person.
 </p><p>
 The image of the sun where it falls appears as a thing which covers
 the person who attempts to cover it.
 </p><p>
 (Money and Gold.)
 </p><p>
 Out of cavernous pits a thing shall come forth which will make all
 the nations of the world toil and sweat with the greatest torments,
 anxiety and labour, that they may gain its aid.
 </p><p>
 (Of the Dread of Poverty.)
 </p><p>
 The malicious and terrible [monster] will cause so much terror of
 itself in men that they will rush together, with a rapid motion,
 like madmen, thinking they are escaping her boundless force.
 </p><p>
 (Of Advice.)
 </p><p>
 The man who may be most necessary to him who needs him, will be
 repaid with ingratitude, that is greatly contemned.
