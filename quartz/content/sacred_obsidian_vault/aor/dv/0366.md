 Every part of the whole must be in proportion to the whole. Thus, if
 a man is of a stout short figure he will be the same in all his
 parts: that is with short and thick arms, wide thick hands, with
 short fingers with their joints of the same character, and so on
 with the rest. I would have the same thing understood as applying to
 all animals and plants; in diminishing, [the various parts] do so in
 due proportion to the size, as also in enlarging.
