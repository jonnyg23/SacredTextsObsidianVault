 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF THE HERBS OF THE FIELD.</h3>
 <p>
 Of the plants which take a shadow from the plants which spring among
 them, those
 </p><p><a name="page_223"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 223</font></a></p>
 <p>which are on this side [in front] of the shadow have the
 stems lighted up on a background of shadow, and the plants on which
 the shadows fall have their stems dark on a light background; that
 is on the background beyond the shadow.
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF TREES WHICH ARE BETWEEN THE EYE AND THE LIGHT.</h3>
 <p>
 Of the trees which are between the eye and the light the part in
 front will be light; but this light will be broken by the
 ramifications of transparent leaves--being seen from the under
 side--and lustrous leaves--being seen from the upper side; and the
 background below and behind will be dark green, being in shadow from
 the front portion of the said tree. This occurs in trees placed
 above the eye.
