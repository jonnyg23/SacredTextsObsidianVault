 The Lion tribe will be seen tearing open the earth with their clawed
 paws and in the caves thus made, burying themselves together with
 the other animals that are beneath them.
 </p><p>
 Animals will come forth from the earth in gloomy vesture, which will
 attack the human species with astonishing assaults, and which by
 their ferocious bites will make confusion of blood among those they
 devour.
 </p><p>
 Again the air will be filled with a mischievous winged race which
 will assail men and beasts and feed upon them with much noise--
 filling themselves with scarlet blood.
