 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> What is life? (1162. 1163).</font></span>Now you see that the hope and the desire of returning home and to
 one's former state is like the moth to the light, and that the man
 who with constant longing awaits with joy each new spring time, each
 new summer, each new month and new year--deeming that the things he
 longs for are ever too late in coming--does not perceive that he is
 longing for his own destruction. But this desire is the very
 quintessence, the spirit of the elements, which finding itself
 imprisoned with the soul is ever longing to return from the human
 body to its giver. And you must know that this same longing is that
 quintessence, inseparable from nature, and that man is the image of
 the world.
