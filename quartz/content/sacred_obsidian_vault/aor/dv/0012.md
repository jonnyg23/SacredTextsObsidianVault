 Many will think they may reasonably blame me by alleging that my
 proofs are opposed to the authority of certain men held in the
 highest reverence by their inexperienced judgments; not considering
 that my works are the issue of pure and simple experience, who is
 the one true mistress. These rules are sufficient to enable you to
 know the true from the false--and this aids men to look only for
 things that are possible and with due moderation--and not to wrap
 yourself in ignorance, a thing which can have no good result, so
 that in despair you would give yourself up to melancholy.
