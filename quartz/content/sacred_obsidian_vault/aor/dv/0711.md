 </p><h3 align="CENTER">THE MOULD FOR THE HORSE.</h3>
 <p>
 Make the horse on legs of iron, strong and well set on a good
 foundation; then grease it and cover it with a coating, leaving each
 coat to dry thoroughly layer by layer; and this will thicken it by
 the breadth of three fingers. Now fix and bind it with
 </p><p><a name="page_12"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 12</font></a></p>
 <p>iron as may
 be necessary. Moreover take off the mould and then make the
 thickness. Then fill the mould by degrees and make it good
 throughout; encircle and bind it with its irons and bake it inside
 where it has to touch the bronze.
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF MAKING THE MOULD IN PIECES.</h3>
 <p>
 Draw upon the horse, when finished, all the pieces of the mould with
 which you wish to cover the horse, and in laying on the clay cut it
 in every piece, so that when the mould is finished you can take it
 off, and then recompose it in its former position with its joins, by
 the countersigns.
 </p><p>
 The square blocks <i>a b</i> will be between the cover and the core, that
 is in the hollow where the melted bronze is to be; and these square
 blocks of bronze will support the intervals between the mould and
 the cover at an equal distance, and for this reason these squares
 are of great importance.
 </p><p>
 The clay should be mixed with sand.
 </p><p>
 Take wax, to return [what is not used] and to pay for what is used.
 </p><p>
 Dry it in layers.
 </p><p>
 Make the outside mould of plaster, to save time in drying and the
 expense in wood; and with this plaster enclose the irons [props]
 both outside and inside to a thickness of two fingers; make terra
 cotta. And this mould can be made in one day; half a boat load of
 plaster will serve you.
 </p><p>
 Good.
 </p><p>
 Dam it up again with glue and clay, or white of egg, and bricks and
 rubbish.

 In the original, below line 21, a square piece of the page has been
 cut out about 9 centimetres by 7 and a blank piece has been gummed
 into the place.
