 <i>m n o</i> are equal. The narrowest width of the leg seen in front goes
 8 times from the sole of the foot to the joint of the knee, and is
 the same width as the arm, seen in front at the wrist, and as the
 longest measure of the ear, and as the three chief divisions into
 which we divide the face; and this measurement goes 4 times from the
 wrist joint of the hand to the point of the elbow. [14] The foot is
 as long as the space from the knee between <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>; and the
 patella of the knee is as long as the leg between <i>r</i> and <i>s</i>.
 </p><p>
 [18] The least thickness of the leg in profile goes 6 times from the
 sole of the foot
 </p><p><a name="page_179"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 179</font></a></p>
 <p>to the knee joint and is the same width as the
 space between the outer corner of the eye and the opening of the
 ear, and as the thickest part of the arm seen in profile and between
 the inner corner of the eye and the insertion of the hair.
 </p><p>
 <i>a b c</i> [<i>d</i>] are all relatively of equal length, <i>c d</i> goes twice
 from the sole of the foot to the centre of the knee and the same
 from the knee to the hip.
 </p><p>
 [28]<i>a b c</i> are equal; <i>a</i> to <i>b</i> is 2 feet--that is to say
 measuring from the heel to the tip of the great toe.

 <p><a name="fn_155"></a><a href="0331.htm#fr_155">179:153</a> : See <a href="pl015.htm#img_pl015">Pl. XV</a>. The text of lines 2-17 is to the left of the
 front view of the leg, to which it refers. Lines 18-27 are in the
 middle column and refer to the leg seen in profile and turned to the
 left, on the right hand side of the writing. Lines 20-30 are above,
 to the left and apply to the sketch below them.

 Some farther remarks on the proportion of the leg will be found in
 No. 336, lines 6, 7.</p>
