 and having this
 </p><p><a name="page_246"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 246</font></a></p>
 <p>knowledge, their actions should come next, according
 to the circumstances in which they occur in man. And thirdly to
 compose subjects, the studies for which should be taken from natural
 actions and made from time to time, as circumstances allow; and pay
 attention to them in the streets and <i>piazze</i> and fields, and note
 them down with a brief indication of the forms;  <a name="fr_236"></a><a href="#fn_236"><font size="1">234</font></a>
 
 thus for a head make an o, and for an arm a straight or a bent line,
 and the same for the legs and the body,  <a name="fr_237"></a><a href="#fn_237"><font size="1">235</font></a>
  and
 when you return home work out these notes in a complete form. The
 Adversary says that to acquire practice and do a great deal of work
 it is better that the first period of study should be employed in
 drawing various compositions done on paper or on walls by divers
 masters, and that in this way practice is rapidly gained, and good
 methods; to which I reply that the method will be good, if it is
 based on works of good composition and by skilled masters. But since
 such masters are so rare that there are but few of them to be found,
 it is a surer way to go to natural objects, than to those which are
 imitated from nature with great deterioration, and so form bad
 methods; for he who can go to the fountain does not go to the
 water-jar.
