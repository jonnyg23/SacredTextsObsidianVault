 Perspective comes in where judgment fails [as to the distance] in
 objects which diminish. The eye can never be a true judge for
 determining with exactitude how near one object is to another which
 is equal to it [in size], if the top of that other is on the level
 of the eye which sees them on that side, excepting by means of the
 vertical plane which is the standard and guide of perspective. Let
 <i>n</i> be the eye, <i>e f</i> the vertical plane above mentioned. Let <i>a b c
 d</i> be the three divisions, one below the other; if the lines <i>a n</i>
 and <i>c n</i> are of a given length and the eye <i>n</i> is in the centre,
 then <i>a b</i> will look as large as <i>b c. c d</i> is lower and farther off
 from <i>n</i>, therefore it will look smaller. And the same effect will
 appear in the three divisions of a face when the eye of the painter
 who is drawing it is on a level with the eye of the person he is
 painting.
