 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> Useful games and exercises (507. 508).</font></span>When, Oh draughtsmen, you desire to find relaxation in games you
 should always practise such things as may be of use in your

 <p>you draw a straight line at random on a
 wall, and each of you, taking a blade of grass or of straw in his
 hand, try to cut it to the length that the line drawn appears to him
 to be, standing at a distance of 10 braccia; then each one may go up
 to the line to measure the length he has judged it to be. And he who
 has come nearest with his measure to the length of the pattern is
 the best man, and the winner, and shall receive the prize you have
 settled beforehand. Again you should take forshortened measures:
 that is take a spear, or any other cane or reed, and fix on a point
 at a certain distance; and let each one estimate how many times he
 judges that its length will go into that distance. Again, who will
 draw best a line one braccio long, which shall be tested by a
 thread. And such games give occasion to good practice for the eye,
 which is of the first importance in painting.
