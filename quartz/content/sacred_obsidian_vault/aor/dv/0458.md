 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> On the treatment of light for landscapes (458-464).</font></span>The landscape has a finer azure [tone] when, in fine weather the sun
 is at noon than at any other time of the day, because the air is
 purified of moisture; and looking at it under that aspect you will
 see the trees of a beautiful green at the outside and the shadows
 dark towards the middle; and in
 </p><p align="CENTER"><a name="img_v123000"></a>
 <img src="img/v123000.jpg"></p>
 <p>the remoter distance the atmosphere
 which comes between you and them looks more beautiful when there is
 something dark beyond. And still the azure is most beautiful. The
 objects seen from the side on which the sun shines will not show you
 their shadows. But, if you are lower than the sun, you can see what
 is not seen by the sun and that will be all in shade. The leaves of
 the trees, which come between you and the sun are of two principal
 colours which are a splendid lustre of green, and the reflection of
 the atmosphere which lights up the objects which cannot be seen by
 the sun, and the shaded portions which only face the earth,
 </p><p><a name="page_231"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 231</font></a></p>
 <p>and the darkest which are surrounded by something that is not dark. The
 trees in the landscape which are between you and the sun are far
 more beautiful than those you see when you are between the sun and
 them; and this is so because those which face the sun show their
 leaves as transparent towards the ends of their branches, and those
 that are not transparent--that is at the ends--reflect the light;
 and the shadows are dark because they are not concealed by any
 thing.
 </p><p>
 The trees, when you place yourself between them and the sun, will
 only display to you their light and natural colour, which, in
 itself, is not very strong, and besides this some reflected lights
 which, being against a background which does not differ very much
 from themselves in tone, are not conspicuous; and if you are lower
 down than they are situated, they may also show those portions on
 which the light of the sun does not fall and these will be dark.
 </p><p>
 In the Wind.
 </p><p>
 But, if you are on the side whence the wind blows, you will see the
 trees look very much lighter than on the other sides, and this
 happens because the wind turns up the under side of the leaves,
 which, in all trees, is much whiter than the upper sides; and, more
 especially, will they be very light indeed if the wind blows from
 the quarter where the sun is, and if you have your back turned to
 it.
