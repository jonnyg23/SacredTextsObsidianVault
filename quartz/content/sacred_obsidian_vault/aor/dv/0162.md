 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF SHADOW.</h3>
 <p>
 Derived shadows are of three kinds of which one is spreading, the
 second columnar, the third converging to the point where the two
 sides meet and intersect, and beyond this intersection the sides are
 infinitely prolonged or straight lines. And if you say, this shadow
 must terminate at the angle where the sides meet and extend no
 farther, I deny this, because above in the first on shadow I have
 proved: that a thing is completely terminated when no portion of it
 goes beyond its terminating lines. Now here, in this shadow, we see
 the converse of this, in as much as where this derived shadow
 originates we obviously have the figures of two pyramids of shadow
 which meet at their angles. Hence, if, as [my] opponent says, the
 first pyramid of shadow terminates the derivative shadow at the
 angle whence it starts, then the second pyramid of shadow--so says
 the adversary--must be caused by the angle and not from the body in
 shadow; and this is disproved with the help of the 2nd of this which
 says: Shadow is a condition produced by a body casting a shadow, and
 interposed between this shadow and the luminous body. By this it is
 made clear that the shadow is not produced by the angle of the
 derived shadow but only by the body casting the shadow; &amp;c If a
 spherical solid body is illuminated by a light of elongated form the
 shadow produced by the longest portion of this light will have less
 defined outlines than that which is produced by the breadth of the
 same light. And this is proved by what was said before, which is:
 That a shadow will have less defined outlines in proportion as the
 light which causes it is larger, and conversely, the outlines are
 clearer in proportion as it is smaller.
