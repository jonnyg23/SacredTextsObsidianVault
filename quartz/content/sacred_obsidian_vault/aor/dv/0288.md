 </p><h3 align="CENTER">WHETHER THE COLOURS OF THE RAINBOW ARE PRODUCED BY THE SUN.</h3>
 <p>
 The colours of the rainbow are not produced by the sun, for they
 occur in many ways without the sunshine; as may be seen by holding a
 glass of water up to the eye; when, in the glass--where there are
 those minute bubbles always seen in coarse glass--each bubble, even
 though the sun does not fall on it, will produce on one side all the
 colours of the rainbow; as you may see by placing the glass between
 the day light and your eye in such a way as that it is close to the
 eye, while on one side the glass admits the [diffused] light of the
 atmosphere, and on the other side the shadow of the wall on one side
 of the window; either left or right, it matters not which. Then, by
 turning the glass round you will see these colours all round the
 bubbles in the glass &amp;c And the rest shall be said in its place.
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">THAT THE EYE HAS NO PART IN PRODUCING THE COLOURS OF THE RAINBOW.</h3>
 <p align="CENTER"><a name="img_v115301"></a>

 <p>
 In the experiment just described, the eye would seem to have some
 share in the colours of the rainbow, since these bubbles in the
 glass do not display the colours except through the medium of the
 eye. But, if you place the glass full of water on the window sill,
 in such a position as that the outer side is exposed to the sun's
 rays, you will see the same colours produced in the spot of light
 thrown through the glass and upon the floor, in a dark place, below
 the window; and as the eye is not here concerned in it, we may
 evidently, and with certainty pronounce that the eye has no share in
 producing them.

 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF THE COLOURS IN THE FEATHERS OF CERTAIN BIRDS.</h3>
 <p>
 There are many birds in various regions of the world on whose
 feathers we see the most splendid colours produced as they move, as
 we see in our own country in the feathers of peacocks or on the
 necks of ducks or pigeons, &amp;c
 </p><p>
 Again, on the surface of antique glass found underground and on the
 roots of turnips kept for some time at the bottom of wells or other
 stagnant waters [we see] that each root displays colours similar to
 those of the real rainbow. They may also be seen when oil has been
 placed on the top of water and in the solar rays reflected from the
 surface of a diamond or beryl; again, through the angular facet of a
 beryl every dark object against a background of the atmosphere or
 any thing else equally pale-coloured is surrounded by these rainbow
 colours between the atmosphere and the dark body; and in many other
 circumstances which I will not mention, as these suffice for my
 purpose.
