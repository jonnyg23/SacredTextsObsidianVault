 <p>
 And those who feed on grass will turn night into day (Tallow.)
 </p><p>
 And many creatures of land and water will go up among the stars (
 that is Planets.)
 </p><p>
 The dead will be seen carrying the living (in Carts and Ships in
 various places.)
 </p><p>
 Food shall be taken out of the mouth of many (the oven's mouth.)
 </p><p>
 And those which will have their food in their mouth will be deprived
 of it by the hands of others (the oven.)
