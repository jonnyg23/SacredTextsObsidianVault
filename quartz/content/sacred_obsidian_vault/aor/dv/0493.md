 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> The artist's private life and choice of company (493-494).</font></span>A painter needs such mathematics as belong to painting. And the
 absence of all companions who are alienated from his studies; his
 brain must be easily impressed by the variety of objects, which
 successively come

 <p>before him, and also free from other cares
  <a name="fr_239"></a><a href="#fn_239"><font size="1">237</font></a>
 . And if, when
 considering and defining one subject, a second subject
 intervenes--as happens when an object occupies the mind, then he
 must decide which of these cases is the more difficult to work out,
 and follow that up until it becomes quite clear, and then work out
 the explanation of the other  <a name="fr_240"></a><a href="#fn_240"><font size="1">238</font></a>
 . And above all he must keep his mind as clear as the
 surface of a mirror, which assumes colours as various as those of
 the different objects. And his companions should be like him as to
 their studies, and if such cannot be found he should keep his
 speculations to himself alone, so that at last he will find no more
 useful company [than his own].

 <p><a name="fn_241"></a><a href="0493.htm#fr_241">248:239</a> : In the title line Leonardo had originally written <i>del
 pictore filosofo</i> (the philosophical painter), but he himself struck
 out<i>filosofo</i>. Compare in No. 363 <i>pictora notomista</i> (anatomical
