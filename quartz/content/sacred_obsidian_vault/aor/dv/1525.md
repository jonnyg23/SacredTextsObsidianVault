 Memorandum. That on the 8th day of
 April 1503, I, Leonardo da Vinci, lent to
 Vante, miniature painter 4 gold ducats, in
 gold. Salai carried them to him and gave
 them into his own hand, and he said he would
 repay within the space of 40 days.
 </p><p>
 Memorandum. That on the same day I
 paid to Salai 3 gold ducats which he said
 he wanted for a pair of rose-coloured
 hose with their trimming; and there remain
 9 ducats due to him-excepting that he owes
 me 20 ducats, that is 17 I lent him at Milan,
 and 3 at Venice.
 </p><p>
 Memorandum. That I gave Salai 21 braccia
 of cloth to make a shirt, at io soldi
 the braccio, which I gave him on the
 20th day of April 1503.

 <p><a name="fn_546"></a><a href="1525.htm#fr_546">457:846</a> : With regard to Vante or Attavante, the miniature
 painter (not Nanni as I formerly deciphered
 this name, which is difficult to read; see Zeitschrift
 fur Bild. Kunst<i>, 1879, p. 155), and Vasari, Lives of Frate
 Giovanni da Fiesole, of Bartolommeo della Gatta,
 and of Gherardo, </i>miniatore.<i> He, like Leonardo, was
 one of the committee of artists who, in 1503, considered
 the erection and placing of Michel Angelo's David.
 The date of his death is not known; he was of the
 same age as Leonardo. Further details will be found
 in '</i>Notizie di Attavante miniatore, e di alcuni suoi lavori<i>'
 (Milanese's ed. of Vasari, III, 231-235).</i></p>
