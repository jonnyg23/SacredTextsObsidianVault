 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF THE MOON.</h3>
 <p>
 The moon has no light in itself; but so much of it as faces the sun
 is illuminated, and of that illumined portion we see so much as
 faces the earth. And the moon's night receives just as much light as
 is lent it by our waters as they reflect the image of the sun, which
 is mirrored in all those waters which are on the side towards the
 sun. The outside or surface of the waters forming the seas of the
 moon and of the seas of our globe is always ruffled little or much,
 or more or less--and this roughness causes an extension of the
 numberless images of the sun which are repeated in the ridges and
 hollows, the sides and fronts of the innumerable waves; that is to
 say in as many different spots on each wave as our eyes find
 different positions to view them from. This could not happen, if the
 aqueous sphere which covers a great part of the moon were uniformly
 spherical, for then the images of the sun would be one to each
 spectator, and its reflections would be separate and independent and
 its radiance would always appear circular; as is plainly to be seen
 in the gilt balls placed on the tops of high buildings. But if those
 gilt balls were rugged or composed of several little balls, like
 mulberries, which are a black fruit composed of minute round
 globules, then each portion of these little balls, when seen in the
 sun, would display to the eye the lustre resulting from the
 reflection of the sun, and thus, in one and the same body many tiny
 suns would be seen; and these often combine at a long distance and
 appear as one. The lustre of the new moon is brighter and stronger,
 than when the moon is full; and the reason of this is that the angle
 of incidence is more obtuse in the new than in the full moon, in
 which the angles [of incidence and reflection] are highly acute. The
 waves of the moon therefore mirror the sun in the hollows of the
 waves as well as on the ridges, and the sides remain in shadow. But
 at the sides
 </p><p><a name="page_158"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 158</font></a></p>
 <p>of the moon the hollows of the waves do not catch the
 sunlight, but only their crests; and thus the images are fewer and
 more mixed up with the shadows in the hollows; and this
 intermingling of the shaded and illuminated spots comes to the eye
 with a mitigated splendour, so that the edges will be darker,
 because the curves of the sides of the waves are insufficient to
 reflect to the eye the rays that fall upon them. Now the new moon
 naturally reflects the solar rays more directly towards the eye from the
 </p><p align="CENTER"><a name="img_v215800"></a>
 <img src="img/v215800.jpg"></p>
 crests of the waves than from any other part, as is shown by the
 form of the moon, whose rays a strike the waves <i>b</i> and are
 reflected in the line <i>b d</i>, the eye being situated at <i>d</i>. This
 cannot happen at the full moon, when the solar rays, being in the
 west, fall on the extreme waters of the moon to the East from <i>n</i> to
 <i>m</i>, and are not reflected to the eye in the West, but are thrown
 back eastwards, with but slight deflection from the straight course
 of the solar ray; and thus the angle of incidence is very wide
 indeed.

 The moon is an opaque and solid body and if, on the contrary, it
 were transparent, it would not receive the light of the sun.

 The yellow or yolk of an egg remains in the middle of the albumen,
 without moving on either side; now it is either lighter or heavier
 than this albumen, or equal to it; if it is lighter, it ought to
 rise above all the albumen and stop in contact with the shell
 </p><p><a name="page_159"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 159</font></a></p>
 <p>of the egg; and if it is heavier, it ought to sink, and if it is equal, it
 might just as well be at one of the ends, as in the middle or below [54].

 The innumerable images of the solar rays reflected from the
 innumerable waves of the sea, as they fall upon those waves, are
 what cause us to see the very broad and continuous radiance on the
 surface of the sea.
