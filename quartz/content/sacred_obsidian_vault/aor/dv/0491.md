 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> Industry and thoroughness the first conditions (491-493.)</font></span>We know for certain that sight is one of the most rapid actions we
 can perform. In an instant we see an infinite number of forms, still
 we only take in thoroughly one object at a time. Supposing that you,
 Reader, were to glance rapidly at the whole of this written page,
 you would instantly perceive that it was covered with various
 letters; but you could not, in the time, recognise what the letters
 were, nor what they were meant to tell. Hence you would need to see
 them word by word, line by line to be able to understand the
 letters. Again, if you wish to go to the top of a building you must
 go up step by step; otherwise it will be

 <p>impossible that you should
 reach the top. Thus I say to you, whom nature prompts to pursue this
 art, if you wish to have a sound knowledge of the forms of objects
 begin with the details of them, and do not go on to the second
 [step] till you have the first well fixed in memory and in practice.
 And if you do otherwise you will throw away your time, or certainly
 greatly prolong your studies. And remember to acquire diligence
 rather than rapidity.
