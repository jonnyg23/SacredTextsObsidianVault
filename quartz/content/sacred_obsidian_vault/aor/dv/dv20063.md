 <a href="pl098.htm#img_pl098">Pl. XCVIII</a> (P. V., 182. No. d'ordre 2386<i>). In the midst of a hilly
 landscape rises an artificial mountain in the form of a gigantic
 cone, crowned by an imposing temple. At two thirds of the height a
 terrace is cut out with six doorways forming entrances to galleries,
 each leading to three sepulchral halls, so constructed as to contain
 about five hundred funeral urns, disposed in the customary antique
 style. From two opposite sides steps ascend to the terrace in a
 single flight and beyond it to the temple above. A large circular
 opening, like that in the Pantheon, is in the dome above what may be
 the altar, or perhaps the central monument on the level of the
 terrace below.
 </i></p><p>
 The section of a gallery given in the sketch to the right below
 shows the roof to be constructed on the principle of superimposed
 horizontal layers, projecting one beyond the other, and each
 furnished with a sort of heel, which appears to be undercut, so as
 to give the appearance of a beam from within. Granite alone would be
 adequate to the dimensions here given to the key stone, as the
 thickness of the layers can hardly be considered to be less than a
 foot. In taking this as the basis of our calculation for the
 dimensions of the whole construction, the width of the chamber would
 be about 25 feet but, judging from the number of urns it
 contains--and there is no reason to suppose that these urns were
 larger than usual--it would seem to be no more than about 8 or 10
 feet.
 </p><p>
 The construction of the vaults resembles those in the galleries of
 some etruscan tumuli, for instance the Regulini Galeassi tomb at
 Cervetri (lately discovered) and also that of the chamber and
 passages of the pyramid of Cheops and of the treasury of Atreus at
 Mycenae.
 </p><p>
 The upper cone displays not only analogies with the monuments
 mentioned in the note, but also with Etruscan tumuli, such as the
 Cocumella

 . <i>The whole
 scheme is one of the most magnificent in the history of
 Architecture.
 </i></p><p>
 It would be difficult to decide as to whether any monument he had
 seen suggested this idea to Leonardo, but it is worth while to
 enquire, if any monument, or group of monuments of an earlier date
 may be supposed to have done so. <a name="fr_49"></a><a href="#fn_49"><font size="1">383</font></a>

 Algiers, two Monuments, commonly called</i> "Le Madracen" <i>and</i> "Le
 tombeau de la Chretienne," <i>which somewhat resemble Leonardo's
 design. They are known to have served as the Mausolea of the Kings
 of Mauritania. Pomponius Mela, the geographer of the time of the
 Emperor Claudius, describes them as having been</i> "Monumentum commune
 regiae gentis." <i>See</i> Le Madracen, Rapport fait par M. le Grand

 LALANNE, Bibliothecaire of the Institut for having first pointed out
 to me the resemblance between these monuments; while M. ANT. HERON
 DE VlLLEFOSSE of the Louvre was kind enough to place the
 abovementioned rare works at my disposal. Leonardo's observations on
 the coast of Africa are given later in this work. The Herodium near
 Bethlehem in Palestine</i> (Jebel el Fureidis, <i>the Frank Mountain)
 was, according to the latest researches, constructed on a very
 similar plan. See</i> Der Frankenberg, von Baurath C. SCHICK in
