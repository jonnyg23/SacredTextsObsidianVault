 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> The Caspian Sea (1105. 1106).</font></span>From the shore of the Southern coast of Cilicia may be seen to the
 South the beautiful island of Cyprus, which was the realm of the
 goddess Venus, and many navigators being attracted by her beauty,
 had their ships and rigging broken amidst the reefs, surrounded by
 the whirling waters. Here the beauty of delightful hills tempts
 wandering mariners to refresh themselves amidst their flowery
 verdure, where the winds are tempered and fill the island and the
 surrounding seas with fragrant odours. Ah! how many a ship has here
 been sunk. Ah! how many a vessel broken on these rocks. Here might
 be seen barks without number, some wrecked and half covered by the
 sand; others showing the poop and another the prow, here a keel and
 there the ribs; and it seems like a day of judgment when there
 should be a resurrection of dead ships, so great is the number of
 them covering all the Northern shore; and while the North gale makes
 various and fearful noises there.
