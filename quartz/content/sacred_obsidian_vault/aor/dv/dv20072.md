 <p>
 <i>Several of Leonardo's drawings of architectural details prove that,
 like other great masters of that period, he had devoted his
 attention to the study of the proportion of such details. As every
 organic being in nature has its law of construction and growth,
 these masters endeavoured, each in his way, to discover and prove a
 law of proportion in architecture. The following notes in Leonardo's
 manuscripts refer to this subject.</i>

 as given by Vitruvius and by Leon Battista Alberti for the
 proportions of the Attic base of a column.</i>
