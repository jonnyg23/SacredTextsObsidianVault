 <p>
 The surface of an object partakes of the colour of the light which
 illuminates it; and of the colour of the atmosphere which lies
 between the eye and that object, that is of the colour of the
 transparent medium lying between the object and the eye; and among
 colours of a similar character the second will be of the same tone
 as the first, and this is caused by the increased thickness of the
 colour of the medium lying between the object and the eye.
