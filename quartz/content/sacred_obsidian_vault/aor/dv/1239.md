 </p><h3 align="CENTER">THE OYSTER.--FOR TREACHERY.</h3>
 <p>
 This creature, when the moon is full opens itself wide, and when the
 crab looks in he throws in a piece of rock or seaweed and the oyster
 cannot close again, whereby it serves for food to that crab. This is
 what happens to him who opens his mouth to tell his secret. He
 becomes the prey of the treacherous hearer.

 </p><h3 align="CENTER">THE BASILISK.--CRUELTY.</h3>
 <p>
 All snakes flie from this creature; but the weasel attacks it by
 means of rue and kills it.
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">THE ASP.</h3>
 <p>
 This carries instantaneous death in its fangs; and, that it may not
 hear the charmer it stops its ears with its tail.
