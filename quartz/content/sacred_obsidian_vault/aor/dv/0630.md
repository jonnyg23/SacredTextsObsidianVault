 </p><h3 align="CENTER">TO REMOVE THE SMELL OF OIL.</h3>
 <p>
 Take the rank oil and put ten pints into a jar and make a mark on
 the jar at the height of the oil; then add to it a pint of vinegar
 and make it boil till the oil has sunk to the level of the mark and
 thus you will be certain that the oil is returned to its original
 quantity and the vinegar will have gone off in vapour, carrying with
 it the evil smell; and I believe you may do the same with nut oil or
 any other oil that smells badly.
