 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> Vitruvius' scheme of proportions.</font></span>Vitruvius, the architect, says in his work on architecture that the
 measurements of the human body are distributed by Nature as follows:
 that is that 4 fingers make 1 palm, and 4 palms make 1 foot, 6 palms
 make 1 cubit; 4 cubits make a man's height. And 4 cubits make one
 pace and 24 palms make a man; and these measures he used in his
 buildings. If you open your legs so much as to decrease your height
 1/14 and spread and raise your arms till your middle fingers touch
 the level of the top of your head you must know that the centre of
 the outspread limbs will be in the navel and the space between the
 legs will be an equilateral triangle.
 </p><p>
 The length of a man's outspread arms is equal to his height.
 </p><p>
 From the roots of the hair to the bottom of the chin is the tenth of
 a man's height; from the bottom of the chin to the top of his head
 is one eighth of his height; from the top of the breast to the top
 of his head will be one sixth of a man. From the top of the breast
 to the roots of the hair will be the seventh part of the whole man.
 From the nipples to the top of the head will be the fourth part of a
 man. The greatest width of the shoulders contains in itself the
 fourth part of the man. From the elbow to the tip of the hand will
 be the fifth part of a man; and from the elbow to the angle of the
 armpit will be the eighth part of the man. The whole hand will be
 the tenth part of
 </p><p><a name="page_183"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 183</font></a></p>
 <p>the man; the beginning of the genitals marks the
 middle of the man. The foot is the seventh part of the man. From the
 sole of the foot to below the knee will be the fourth part of the
 man. From below the knee to the beginning of the genitals will be
 the fourth part of the man. The distance from the bottom of the chin
 to the nose and from the roots of the hair to the eyebrows is, in
 each case the same, and like the ear, a third of the face.
