 It seems to me to be no small charm in a painter when he gives his
 figures a

 <p>pleasing air, and this grace, if he have it not by nature,
 he may acquire by incidental study in this way: Look about you and
 take the best parts of many beautiful faces, of which the beauty is
 confirmed rather by public fame than by your own judgment; for you
 might be mistaken and choose faces which have some resemblance to
 your own. For it would seem that such resemblances often please us;
 and if you should be ugly, you would select faces that were not
 beautiful and you would then make ugly faces, as many painters do.
 For often a master's work resembles himself. So select beauties as I
 tell you, and fix them in your mind.
