 <p>The card represents motion through the immovable-a flight of wands through an open country; but they draw to the term of their course. That which they signify is at hand; it may be even on the threshold. <i>Divinatory Meanings</i>: Activity in undertakings, the path of such activity, swiftness, as that of an express messenger; great haste, great hope, speed towards an end which promises assured felicity; generally, that which is on the move; also the arrows of love. <i>Reversed</i>: Arrows of jealousy, internal dispute, stingings of conscience, quarrels; and domestic disputes for persons who are married.</p>
