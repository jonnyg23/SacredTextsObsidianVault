 <p>A laurelled horseman bears one staff adorned with a laurel crown; footmen with staves are at his side. <i>Divinatory Meanings</i>: The card has been so designed that it can cover several significations; on the surface, it is a victor triumphing, but it is also great news, such as might be carried in state by the King's courier; it is expectation crowned with its own desire, the crown of hope, and so forth. <i>Reversed</i>: Apprehension, fear, as of a victorious enemy at the gate; treachery, disloyalty, as of gates being opened to the enemy; also indefinite delay.</p>
