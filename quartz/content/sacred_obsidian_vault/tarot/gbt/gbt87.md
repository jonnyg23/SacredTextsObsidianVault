 </p><table align="LEFT"><tr><td align="CENTER" valign="CENTER"><img src="img/winit.jpg" alt="W"></td></tr></table>E offer the descriptions in this work with the most humble reserve as regards completeness. We are fully aware, that on these lines the last word will not be said in the near future. On the other hand we feel sure, that the key to the mystic system, known as the TARO(T), presented here, does work, for we have used it in practical divination for some time already and it has proved to be true, apart from its theoretical value, which may be judged by those who have studied the ancient mysteries in general and astrology in particular.  
 <p>We abstain from adding more concerning the practice of divination in the present volume--it will demand another one.</p>
