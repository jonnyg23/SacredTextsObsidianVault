 <p>TRADITION: Gold, riches, opulence, magnificence, brilliancy, luxury, the struggle for riches, "physical, philosophical and moral sun." (<i>P</i>.) But also process, trickery, contradiction, discussion, chicane, etc.</p>  
 <p>THEORY: <i>Air</i> on the <i>Fifth house</i>: that of the sun. The house of the heart and of children, of speculation and love affairs, of pride and of will-power. There is more of the richness of the heart in it than of material abundance, though generally Leo-people know how to reach the latter. It is a house of Fire, and the combination of Fire and Air makes warm air,</p>

 <p>which may be used to heat rooms, in the same way as words, that contain warm feelings of the heart, will do good to other people, and on the other hand hot speech will arouse lively contradiction. Here is the same mistake: the card is not that of contradiction, but of hot speech, very positive expression, and contentions, suggestions, rather than discussion, egocentric thought, from which we may conclude, that it will evoke contradiction, or some other effect. But we have to do with the proper meaning of a card itself. It is quite true, that the house Leo may bring gold and presents. Thought-power taken to heart, or taking its motives from love and from the desires and wishes of the heart, may very often be more selfish than reasonable, but it is a real pushing power and therefore generally is the most helpful element towards attaining the goal. This, of course, has been the reason for ascribing riches, etc., to this card.</p>  
 <p>CONCLUSION: <i>Egotism, positive speech, contention, persuasion, suggestion, hot speech, demonstration</i> (<i>e.g. of love or desire</i>); <i>pushing power;</i> all this may lead to <i>trickery</i>, to <i>competition</i> perhaps, and to <i>struggle for riches</i> certainly; it means <i>speaking and thinking to such a self-centred way, that no notice is taken of other people's standpoint;</i> consequently <i>clashing of opinions;</i> sometimes it may allude to <i>gold and presents, but to the promise rather than to the fact</i>. There is <i>little or no evil</i> in this card. At most it may denote <i>stupid and childish persistence in one's own personal opinion, e.g. wishes</i>. It has something <i>sunny</i> in it and is <i>good for health and wealth in a general way</i>, promoting both, but it <i>is not</i> 'riches' in itself.</p>
