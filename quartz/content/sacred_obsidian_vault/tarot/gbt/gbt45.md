 <p>TRADITION: Perfect contentment, felicity, happiness, ecstasy, perfect joy, perfect remedy, fulfilment of what has been asked in prayer. Reversed: Capital, riches, opulence, treasure. Something of principal value or valuable, dear, expensive, rare, highly esteemed.</p>  
 <p>THEORY: The element of <i>Fire</i>, of the nature of the Sun and Venus, on the <i>house of the Sun, the Fifth:</i> indeed this card has been well defined by the traditional renderings, which give it all as very benefic. How could it be anything else? The aces are all more or less a commencement, new prospects, etc. If you get the ace of pentacles or hearts on one</p>

 <p>of your houses in the horoscopic figure, you may be pretty sure that the matters to which the house in question relates will be beneficial and, on account of the fiery element, irresistible. It means the commencement of that what is wished for, desired, and this is what man calls his happiness. It is the spark of the Ego demonstrated in the practice of daily life; and this is what may well be called the note of good, which also brings good luck to other people. So there is creative energy in this card. Not yet worked out into details, but originally decided and fairly sure to work out in the future in lucky events and prosperous happenings. So there is promise in it and it is above all a card of good augury of a new and prosperous beginning. It is like a bright spark. Even among very bad cards it is the bright spark of hope and good-will, though of course in such cases it may be too weak to conquer adverse circumstances immediately. It may mean further a person or thing of first ranking. A child. A speculation.</p>  
 <p>CONCLUSION: <i>Creative energy, fulfilment of hope, wish and desire, good luck, bright prospects, beginning of a new era in life, happiness, good augury; a child; a speculation. As to material effects it is benefic without being in itself the indication of riches or gold. It may be a present, a donation. Profit. Promise. Goodness. Favour. It may indicate the person, who is chiefly of interest, and of benefic influence</i>.</p>
