 <h1 align="CENTER">THE LAMENTS OF ISIS AND NEPHTHYS</h1>
 <p align="CENTER">(BERLIN PAP. 1425)</p>
 <p>INVOCATION concerning the glorious things done by the two goddesses of the temple of Osiris, Khent-Amentit, <a name="fr_0"></a><a href="#fn_0"><font size="1">1</font></a> the great God of Abydos; performed in the 4th summer month, 25th day; likewise to be performed in every shrine of Osiris at every one of his Heb-festivals. <a name="fr_1"></a><a href="#fn_1"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>
 <p>Glorify his soul! Establish his dead body!<br>
 Praise his spirit! Give breath to his nostrils and to his parched throat!<br>
 Give gladness unto the heart of Isis and to that of Nephthys;<br>
 Place Horus upon the throne of his Father<br>
 Give life, stability and power to Osiris Thentirti, <a name="fr_2"></a><a href="#fn_2"><font size="1">3</font></a><br>
 Born of the great forsaken one, she who is called also Pelses, the truthful--<br>
 Glorious are her acts, according to the words of the gods.</p>
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_21"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 21</font></a></p>
 <p>Behold now, Isis speaketh,--<br>
 Come to thy temple, come to thy temple, oh An! <a name="fr_3"></a><a href="#fn_3"><font size="1">1</font></a><br>
 Come to thy temple, for thine enemies are not<br>
 Behold the excellent sistrum-bearer--come to thy temple!<br>
 Lo I, thy sister, love thee--do not thou depart from me!<br>
 Behold Hunnu, <a name="fr_4"></a><a href="#fn_4"><font size="1">2</font></a> the beautiful one<br>
 Come to thy temple immediately--come to thy temple immediately! Behold thou my heart, which grieveth for thee;<br>
 Behold me seeking for thee--I am searching for thee to behold thee!<br>
 Lo, I am prevented from beholding thee--<br>
 I am prevented from beholding thee, oh An! <a name="fr_5"></a><a href="#fn_3"><font size="1">1</font></a><br>
 It is blessed to behold thee--come to the one who loveth thee!<br>
 Come to the one who loveth thee, oh thou who art beautiful, Un-Nofer, <a name="fr_6"></a><a href="#fn_5"><font size="1">3</font></a> deceased.<br>
 Come to thy sister--come to thy wife--<br>
 Come to thy wife, oh thou who makest the heart to rest.<br>
 I, thy sister, born of thy mother, go about to every temple of thine,<br>
 Yet thou comest not forth to me<br>
 Gods, and men before the face of the gods, are weeping for thee at the same time, when they behold me!</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_22"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 22</font></a></p>
 <p>Lo, I invoke thee with wailing that reacheth high as heaven,--<br>
 Yet thou hearest not my voice. Lo I, thy sister, I love thee more than all the earth--<br>
 And thou lovest not another as thou dost thy sister--<br>
 Surely thou lovest not another as thou dost thy sister!</p>
 <p>Behold now, Nephthys speaketh,--<br>
 Behold the excellent sistrum-bearer! Come to thy temple!<br>
 Cause thy heart to rejoice, for thy enemies are not!<br>
 All thy sister-goddesses are at thy side and behind thy couch,<br>
 Calling upon thee with weeping--yet thou art prostrate upon thy bed!<br>
 Hearken unto the beautiful words uttered by us and by every noble one among us!<br>
 Subdue thou every sorrow which is in the hearts of us thy sisters,<br>
 Oh thou strong one among the gods,--strong among men who behold thee!<br>
 We come before thee, oh prince, our lord<br>
 Live before us, desiring to behold thee<br>
 Turn not thou away thy face before us<br>
 Sweeten our hearts when we behold thee, oh prince!<br>
 Beautify our hearts when we behold thee<br>
 I, Nephthys, thy sister, I love thee:</p>
 <p><a name="page_23"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 23</font></a></p>
 <p>Thy foes are subdued, there is not one remaining.<br>
 Lo, I am with thee; I shall protect thy limbs for ever, eternally.</p>
 <p>Behold now, Isis speaketh,--<br>
 Praised be An <a name="fr_7"></a><a href="#fn_6"><font size="1">1</font></a> thou shinest upon us from heav'n every day,<br>
 Yet can we not behold thy beams.<br>
 Tehuti <a name="fr_8"></a><a href="#fn_7"><font size="1">2</font></a> protecteth thee, he causeth thy soul to be established within the Maadet boat, <a name="fr_9"></a><a href="#fn_8"><font size="1">3</font></a> by<br>
 the power of thy name of "Iah"!<br>
 Come to me; for I would behold thee and thy beauties by means of the Uazit eye,-- <a name="fr_10"></a><a href="#fn_9"><font size="1">4</font></a><br>
 By the power of thy name of "Lord of the six festivals"!<br>
 Thy royal attendants are by thy side, nor go they forth from thee;<br>
 Thou takest possession of heaven by the greatness of thy terrors, and by the power of thy name of "Prince of the fifteen festivals"!<br>
 Thou shinest upon us like Ra, the lord--<br>
 Glow thou above us like Tum.<br>
 Gods and men live when beholding thee-shine thou upon us;<br>
 Brighten thou the two lands; <a name="fr_11"></a><a href="#fn_10"><font size="1">5</font></a><br>
 The two horizons are fitted for thy pathways.</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_24"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 24</font></a></p>
 <p>Gods together with men are with thee;<br>
 No harm cometh unto them from thy shining,<br>
 Nor from thy journeying in the celestial boat <a name="fr_12"></a><a href="#fn_11"><font size="1">1</font></a> above.<br>
 Thy enemies have ceased to be, for I am protecting thee, oh Ra, lord!<br>
 Come thou to us as a babe, thou first great Sun god.<br>
 Depart not from us who behold thee<br>
 There proceedeth from thee the strong Orion in heaven at evening, at the resting of every day!<br>
 Lo, it is I, at the approach of the Sothis period, who doth watch for him,<br>
 Nor will I leave off watching for him; for that which proceedeth from thee is revered.<br>
 An emanation from thee causeth life to gods and men, reptiles and animals, and they live by means thereof.<br>
 Come thou to us from thy chamber, in the day when thy soul begetteth emanations,--<br>
 The day when offerings upon offerings are made to thy spirit, which causeth the gods and men likewise to live.<br>
 Praise be to the Lord, for there is no god like unto thee, oh Tum! <a name="fr_13"></a><a href="#fn_12"><font size="1">2</font></a><br>
 Thy soul possesseth the earth, and thy likenesses the underworld;</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_25"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 25</font></a></p>
 <p>Lo, it is prepared for and containeth thy hidden shrine.<br>
 Thy wife is ready to protect thee, and thy son Horus also, as prince of the lands.</p>
 <p>Behold now, Nephthys speaketh,--<br>
 Behold the excellent sistrum-bearer! Come to thy temple, Un-Nofer, deceased,--come to Deddu! <a name="fr_14"></a><a href="#fn_13"><font size="1">1</font></a><br>
 Behold the bull, the begotten one!<br>
 Come thou to Anep (Mendes), the beloved enclosure!<br>
 Come to Khar! Come to the two Deddus (Mendes and Busiris), the place which thy soul loveth, and the souls of thy fathers likewise!<br>
 Thy son, thy child Horus, born of thy sister-goddesses, is before thy face.<br>
 It is I who doth illuminate and protect thee every day--<br>
 I will not depart from thee for ever<br>
 Oh, An, come thou to Sais, for thy name is "Sau" (protector)! <a name="fr_15"></a><a href="#fn_14"><font size="1">2</font></a><br>
 Come to Aper! Behold thou thy mother, Nut, oh thou lovely child!<br>
 Depart thou not from her! Come to her breasts; abundance is therein!<br>
 Thy sister, too, is beautiful, depart thou not from her, oh son!</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_26"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 26</font></a></p>
 <p>Come to Sais, oh Osiris, and to Tarud,<br>
 She who is called also Nisep, born of Pelses, deceased!<br>
 Come to Aper, thy city, thy seat, and to the temple of Deb!<br>
 Thou shalt rest beside thy mother eternally<br>
 She preserveth thy limbs and procureth terror among thy enemies, for she protecteth thy members for ever.<br>
 Behold the excellent sistrum-bearer! Come to thy temple!<br>
 Come, behold thou thy son Horus as prince of gods and men;<br>
 He taketh possession of the cities and the nomes by the magnitude of his terrors;<br>
 Heaven and earth are filled with fear of him,<br>
 And the barbarians are submissive under his terrors. Thy children are among gods and men,<br>
 And the eastern and western horizons are among the attributes of thy producing;<br>
 Thy two sisters are at thy side, purifying thy soul,<br>
 And thy son Horus admitteth thine attributes. There cometh forth funereal and other offerings--beer, bulls and geese--for thee:<br>
 Tehuti proclaimeth thy Heb-festival, and invoketh thee with his protecting formulae;<br>
 Horus covereth thy limbs with his protections<br>
 Every day thy son Horus glorifieth thy spirit,</p>
 <p><a name="page_27"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 27</font></a></p>
 <p>And he avengeth thy name by offerings for thy soul placed at thy secret shrine.<br>
 As for the gods, their arms bear libation vases for the purifying of thy spirit.<br>
 Come to thy children, oh prince, our lord, nor depart thou from them.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Lo! he comes!</p>
