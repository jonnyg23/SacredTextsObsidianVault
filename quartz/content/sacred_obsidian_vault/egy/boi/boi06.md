 <p>May their names remain fixed, and not destroyed for ever before Osiris, Horus, Isis, Nephthys--those gods and goddesses who are herein mentioned;. and before the gods and goddesses in their entirety who are in the underworld, and in the chambers and great shrines existing in the underworld.</p>
 <p>Lo! may they cause to come forth these names existent in the underworld in excellence! Let them be invoked in the Nai-boat <a name="fr_53"></a><a href="#fn_48"><font size="1">1</font></a> of Ra. Let there be given for them funereal offerings upon the altar of the great God, day by day!</p>
 <p>Let there be given for them cool water, and incense as to the excellent kings of Upper and Lower Egypt, who are existent in the underworld. Let them be permitted to go out and come in among those praised of Osiris, who is the breath of those in the underworld. Let it be caused that the beams of Aten <a name="fr_54"></a><a href="#fn_49"><font size="1">2</font></a> may fall upon their bodies every day.</p>

 <p>If there be any man--any one of this land, or any one, Negro, Kushite or Syrian, who removeth this writing, or carrieth it away as a thief, let none approach to them, nor give to them of cooling water; nor let them breathe the zephyrs; nor permit to remain to them son nor daughter of their begetting, nor let the name of such a one be mentioned in the land if they be born, nor let them behold the beams of the sun.</p>
 <p>But if there be a man, any one whomsoever, who beholdeth this writing and causeth my soul and my name to become established among those who are blessed, let it be done for him likewise after his final arriving (at the end of life's voyage) in recompense for what was done by him for me, Osiris.</p>
