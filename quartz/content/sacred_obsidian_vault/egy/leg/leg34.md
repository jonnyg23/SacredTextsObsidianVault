 <p>VI. The priests of the Sun at Heliopolis <a name="fr_272"></a><a href="#fn_270"><font size="1">2</font></a> never carry wine into their temples, for they regard it as indecent for those who are devoted to the service of any god to indulge in the drinking of wine whilst they are under the immediate inspection of their Lord and King. <a name="fr_273"></a><a href="#fn_271"><font size="1">3</font></a> The priests of the other deities are not so scrupulous in this respect, for they use it, though sparingly.

For they believe the vine to have first sprung out of the earth after it was fattened by the bodies of those who fell in the wars against the gods. And this, they say, is the reason why drinking its juice in great quantities makes men mad and beside themselves, filling them, as it were, with the blood of their own ancestors. These things are thus related by Eudoxus in the second book of his <i>Travels</i>, as he had them from the priests themselves.</p>
