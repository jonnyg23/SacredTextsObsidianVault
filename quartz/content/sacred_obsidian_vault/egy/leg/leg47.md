 <p>XIX. After these things Osiris returned from the other world, and appeared to his son Horus, and encouraged him to fight, and at the same time instructed him in the exercise of arms. He then asked him what he thought was the most glorious action a man could perform, to which Horus replied, "To revenge the injuries offered to his father <a name="fr_310"></a><a href="#fn_308"><font size="1">2</font></a> and mother." Osiris then asked him what animal he thought most serviceable to a soldier, and Horus replied, "A horse." On this Osiris</p>

 <p>wondered, and he questioned him further, asking him why he preferred a horse to a lion, and Horus replied, "Though the lion is the more serviceable creature to one who stands in need of help, yet is the horse more useful in overtaking and cutting off a flying enemy." <a name="fr_311"></a><a href="#fn_309"><font size="1">1</font></a> These replies caused Osiris to rejoice greatly, for they showed him that his son was sufficiently prepared for his enemy. We are, moreover, told that amongst the great numbers who were continually deserting from Typhon's party was his concubine Thoueris, <a name="fr_312"></a><a href="#fn_310"><font size="1">2</font></a> and that a serpent which pursued her as she was coming over to Horus was slain by his soldiers. The memory of this action is, they say, still preserved in that cord which is thrown into the midst of their assemblies, and then chopped in pieces. Afterwards a battle took place between Horus and Typhon, which lasted many days, but Horus was at length victorious, and Typhon was taken prisoner. He was delivered over into the custody of Isis, who, instead of putting him to death, loosed his fetters and set him free. This action of his mother incensed Horus to such a degree that he seized her, and pulled the royal crown off her head; but Hermes came forward, and set upon her head the head of an ox</p>

 <p>instead of a helmet. <a name="fr_313"></a><a href="leg48.htm#fn_311"><font size="1">1</font></a> After this Typhon accused Horus of illegitimacy, but, by the assistance of Hermes, his legitimacy was fully established by a decree of the gods themselves. <a name="fr_314"></a><a href="leg48.htm#fn_312"><font size="1">2</font></a> After this two other battles were fought between Horus and Typhon, and in both Typhon was defeated. Moreover, Isis is said to have had union with Osiris after his death, <a name="fr_315"></a><a href="leg48.htm#fn_313"><font size="1">3</font></a> and she brought forth Harpokrates, <a name="fr_316"></a><a href="leg48.htm#fn_314"><font size="1">4</font></a> who came into the world before his time, and was lame in his lower limbs.</p>
