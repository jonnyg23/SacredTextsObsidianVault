 <p>manner according to what is customary and right; and he hath spent] both money and grain to no small amount;</p>  
 <p>34. “and [hath provided] everything in great abundance for the house wherein dwelleth the LIVING APIS; and His Majesty hath decorated it with perfect and new ornamentations of the most beautiful character always; and he hath made the LIVING APIS to rise [like the sun], and hath founded temples, and shrines, and chapels [in his honour]; [and he hath repaired the shrines, which needed repairs, and in all matters appertaining to the service of the gods</p>

 <p><a name="page_208"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 208</font></a></p>  
 <p>42. in every temple which is called by his name; and this statue shall rest in the most holy place [in the temples] side by side with the shrines of the gods of the Nomes.
