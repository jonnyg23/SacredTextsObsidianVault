 <p>Whosoever maketh [a copy of] these things in their names according to the similitudes which are in writing on the east [wall] of the Hidden Palace of the Tuat, and whosoever knoweth their names upon earth, and knoweth their habitations in Amentet, shall rest in his habitation in the Tuat, and he shall stand up among the lords of the provisions of the gods, and his voice shall be <i>maat</i> before the <i>tchatcha</i> beings on the day of the reckoning of Pharaoh (literally, the thrice great house). And these things shall act as magical protectors to him that knoweth them upon earth.</p>
 <p>MAK-NEB-S is the name of the hour of the night which guideth this great god in this Circle.</p>
