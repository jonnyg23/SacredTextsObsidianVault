 <h3 align="center">34. NEW-BIRTH OF THE DECEASED KING AS A GOD IN HEAVEN, UTTERANCE 570.</h3>
 
 <p align="center"><i>Utterance
 570</i>.</p>
 
 <p>1443a. To say: The face of heaven is washed; the vault of heaven is bright;</p>
 
 <p>1443b. a god is brought to birth by the sky upon the arms of Shu and Tefnut,
 upon the arms of N.</p>
 
 <p>1444a. "Great <i>wbn</i>," say
 the gods;</p>
 
 <p>1444b. "hear it, this word which N. says to thee;</p>
 
 <p>1444c. let thy heart be glad for this N., for this N. is a Great One, the
 son of a Great One;</p>
 
 <p>1444d. N. is with thee; take this N. for life, joy, and eternity, with
 thee."</p>
 
 <p>1445a. "Khepri, hear it, this word, which is spoken to thee by N.;</p>
 
 <p>1445b. let thy heart be glad for N., for N. is a Great One, the son of a
 Great One;</p>
 
 <p>1445c. N. is with thee; take him with thee."</p>
 
 <p>1446a. "Nun, hear it, this word, which is spoken to thee by N.;</p>
 
 <p>1446b. let thy heart be glad for N., for N. is a Great One, the son of a
 Great One;</p>
 
 <p>1446c. N. is with thee; take him with thee."</p>
 
 <p>1447a. "Atum, hear it, this word, which is spoken to thee by N.;</p>
 
 <p>1447b. let thy heart be glad for N., for N. is a Great One, the son of a
 Great One;</p>
 
 <p>1447c. N. is with thee; take him with thee."</p>
 
 <p>1448a. "<i>Wȝš</i>, son of Geb; <i>Śḫm</i>, son of Osiris,</p>
 
 <p>1448b. hear it, this word is spoken to thee by N.;</p>
 
 <p>1448c. let thy heart be glad for N., for N. is a Great One, the son of a
 Great One;</p>
 
 <p>1448d. N. is with thee; take him with thee."</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_231"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 231</font></a></p>
 
 <p>1449a. Mayest thou be near to N., in thy name of "Rē"; drive
 thou away the garments (darkness) of the sky.</p>
 
 <p>1449b. May Horus of the Horizon cause him to hear his glory and his praise</p>
 
 <p>1449c. out of the mouth of the Two Enneads.</p>
 
 <p>1450a. "How beautiful art thou," said his mother; "(mine)
 heir," said Osiris.</p>
 
 <p>1450b. N. has not swallowed the eye of Horus,</p>
 
 <p>1450c. so that men might say, "he will die for that."</p>
 
 <p>1450d. N. has not swallowed a limb of Osiris,</p>
 
 <p>1450e. so that the gods might say, "he will die for that."</p>
 
 <p>1451a. N. lives on the <i>isnw</i>
 (bread of offering) of his father Atum; protect him, <i>Nḫb.t</i>;</p>
 
 <p>1451b. thou hast protected N., <i>Nḫb.t</i>,
 in the princely house which is in Heliopolis.</p>
 
 <p>1452a. Thou hast commended him to him who is within his <i>ḥn.ti</i> (two limits),</p>
 
 <p>1452b. that N. may be expedited.</p>
 
 <p>1452c. He who is within his <i>ḥn.ti</i>
 (two limits) has recommended N. to him who is on his carrying litter,</p>
 
 <p>1452d. that N. may be expedited.</p>
 
 <p>1453a. N. has escaped his day of death,</p>
 
 <p>1453b. even as Set escaped his day of death;</p>
 
 <p>1453c. N. has escaped the half-months of death,</p>
 
 <p>1453d. even as Set escaped his half-months of death;</p>
 
 <p>1453e. N. has escaped his months of death,</p>
 
 <p>1453f. even as Set escaped his months of death;</p>
 
 <p>14539. N. has escaped the year of death,</p>
 
 <p>1453h. even as Set escaped his year of death,</p>
 
 <p>1454a. by ploughing the earth. The hands of N. support Nut, like Shu,</p>
 
 <p>1454b. even the bones of N. which are firm (or, iron; or, copper), and his
 imperishable limbs;</p>
 
 <p>1455a. for N. is a star, the light-scatterer of the sky.</p>
 
 <p>1455b. Let N. ascend to the god; let N. be avenged,</p>
 
 <p>1455c. so that heaven may not be void of N., so that earth (lit. this land,
 i.e. Egypt) may not be void of N., for ever.</p>
 
 <p>1456a. N. lives a life in accordance with your rule,</p>
 
 <p>1456b. O gods of the lower sky, imperishable stars,</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_232"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 232</font></a></p>
 
 <p>1456c. which traverse the land
  of Libya, which are
 supported by their <i><u>d</u>m</i>-sceptres;</p>
 
 <p>1456d. just as N. is supported, with you, by a <i>wȝś</i>-sceptre and a <i><u>d</u>m</i>-sceptre.</p>
 
 <p>1457a. N. is your fourth,</p>
 
 <p>1457b. O gods of the lower sky, imperishable stars,</p>
 
 <p>1457c. which traverse the land
  of Libya, which are
 supported by their dm-sceptres;</p>
 
 <p>1457d. just as N. is supported, with you, by a <i>wȝś</i>-sceptre and a <i><u>d</u>m</i>-sceptre.</p>
 
 <p>1458a. N. is your fourth,</p>
 
 <p>1458b. O gods of the lower sky, imperishable stars,</p>
 
 <p>11458c. which traverse the land of Libya, which are supported by their
 d'm-sceptres;</p>
 
 <p>1458d. just as N. is supported, with you, by a <i>wȝś</i>-sceptre and a <i><u>d</u>m</i>-sceptre,</p>
 
 <p>1458e. by command of Horus, hereditary prince and king of the gods.</p>
 
 <p>1459a. N. seizes the white crown; that upon which is the wire of the green
 crown.</p>
 
 <p>11459b. N. is the <i>ir.t</i>-serpent,
 which comes forth from Set, which was robbed, but which was returned.</p>
 
 <p>1459c. N. was robbed; he is returned; he is made alive.</p>
 
 <p>1460a. N. is this (kind of) colour which comes out of Nun.</p>
 
 <p>1460b. N. is the eye of Horus, which was not chewed, nor spit out;</p>
 
 <p>1460c. he is not chewed nor spit out.</p>
 
 <p>1461a. Hear it, this word, O Rē, said by N. to thee:</p>
 
 <p>1461b. "Thy body is in N., O Rē; let thy body live in N., O
 Rē."</p>
 
 <p>11462a. "The baboon is a wild-ox," so said <i>knm.wt</i>;</p>
 
 <p>1462b. "<i>knm.w</i>t is a
 wild-ox," so said the baboon.</p>
 
 <p>11462c. O that castrated one! O this man! O he who hurries him who hurries
 (?), among you two!</p>
 
 <p>11462d. These-this first corporation of the company of the justified</p>
 
 <p>11463a. was born before there was any anger;</p>
 
 <p>11463b. was born before there was any clamour (lit. voice);</p>
 
 <p>1463c. was born before there was any strife.,</p>
 
 <p>11463d. was born before there was any conflict;</p>
 
 <p>1463e. was born before the eye of Horus was plucked out; before the
 testicles of Set were torn away.</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_233"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 233</font></a></p>
 
 <p>1464a. N. is blood' which came from Isis;
 N. is red blood which came from Nephthys.</p>
 
 <p>1464b. N. does <i><u>d</u>ḥw3</i> against his
 <i>bnw</i>; there is nothing which the gods
 can do against N.;</p>
 
 <p>1464c. N. is the deputy of Rē; N. shall not die.</p>
 
 <p>1465a. Hear, O Geb, hereditary prince of all the gods, endue him with his
 form.</p>
 
 <p>1465b. Hear, O Thot, who art among the peaceful ones of the gods,</p>
 
 <p>1465c. let a door for N. be opened by Horus; let N. be protected by Set.</p>
 
 <p>1465d. N. appears in the eastern side of the sky,</p>
 
 <p>1465e. like Rē who shines in the eastern side of the sky.</p>
