 <h4><a name="preface">PREFACE.</a></h4>
 
 <p>
 <strong>T</strong>HE Author -- the writer, rather -- feels it
 necessary to apologise for the long delay which has occurred in
 the appearance of this work. It has been occasioned by ill-health
 and the magnitude of the undertaking. Even the two volumes now
 issued do not complete the scheme, and these do not treat exhaustively
 of the subjects dealt with in them. A large quantity of material
 has already been prepared, dealing with the history of occultism
 as contained in the lives of the great Adepts of the Aryan Race,
 and showing the bearing of occult philosophy upon the conduct
 of life, as it is and as it ought to be. Should the present volumes
 meet with a favourable reception, no effort will be spared to
 carry out the scheme of the work in its entirety. The third volume
 is entirely ready; the fourth almost so.
 </p><p>
 This scheme, it must be added, was not in contemplation when the
 preparation of the work was first announced. As originally announced,
 it was intended that the "Secret Doctrine" should be
 an amended and enlarged version of "Isis Unveiled."
 It was, however, soon found that the explanations which could
 be added to those already put before the world in the last-named
 and other works dealing with esoteric science, were such as to
 require a different method of treatment: and consequently the
 present volumes do not contain, in all, twenty pages extracted
 from "Isis Unveiled."
 </p><p>
 The author does not feel it necessary to ask the indulgence of
 her readers and critics for the many defects of literary style,
 and the imperfect English which may be found in these pages. She
 is a foreigner, and her knowledge of the language was acquired
 late in life. The English tongue is employed because it offers
 the most widely-diffused medium for conveying the truths which
 it had become her duty to place before the world.
 </p><p>
 These truths are in no sense put forward as a <i>revelation</i>;
 nor does the author claim the position of a revealer of mystic
 lore, now made public for the first time in the world's history.
 For what is contained in this work is to be found scattered throughout
 thousands of volumes embodying the scriptures of the great Asiatic
 and early European religions, hidden under glyph and symbol, and
 hitherto left unnoticed because of this veil. What is now attempted
 is to gather the oldest tenets together and to make of them one
 harmonious and unbroken whole. The sole advantage which the writer
 has over her predecessors, is that she need not resort to personal
 speculations and theories. For this work is a partial statement
 of what she herself has been taught by more advanced students,
 supplemented, in a few details only, by the results of her</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] viii</h6>
 
 <p>
 own study and observation. The publication of many of the facts
 herein stated has been rendered necessary by the wild and fanciful
 speculations in which many Theosophists and students of mysticism
 have indulged, during the last few years, in their endeavour to,
 as they imagined, work out a complete system of thought from the
 few facts previously communicated to them.
 </p><p>
 It is needless to explain that this book is not the Secret Doctrine
 in its entirety, but a select number of fragments of its fundamental
 tenets, special attention being paid to some facts which have
 been seized upon by various writers, and distorted out of all
 resemblance to the truth.
 </p><p>
 But it is perhaps desirable to state unequivocally that the teachings,
 however fragmentary and incomplete, contained in these volumes,
 belong neither to the Hindu, the Zoroastrian, the Chaldean, nor
 the Egyptian religion,.neither to Buddhism, Islam, Judaism nor
 Christianity exclusively. The Secret Doctrine is the essence of
 all these. Sprung from it in their origins, the various religious
 schemes are now made to merge back into their original element,
 out of which every mystery and dogma has grown, developed, and
 become materialised.
 </p><p>
 It is more than probable that the book will be regarded by a large
 section of the public as a romance of the wildest kind; for who
 has ever even heard of the book of Dzyan?
 </p><p>
 The writer, therefore, is fully prepared to take all the responsibility
 for what is contained in this work, and even to face the charge
 of having invented the whole of it. That it has many shortcomings
 she is fully aware; all that she claims for it is that, romantic
 as it may seem to many, its logical coherence and consistency
 entitle this new Genesis to rank, at any rate, on a level with
 the "working hypotheses" so freely accepted by modern
 science. Further, it claims consideration, not by reason of any
 appeal to dogmatic authority, but because it closely adheres to
 Nature, and follows the laws of uniformity and analogy.
 </p><p>
 The aim of this work may be thus stated: to show that Nature is
 not "a fortuitous concurrence of atoms," and to assign
 to man his rightful place in the scheme of the Universe; to rescue
 from degradation the archaic truths which are the basis of all
 religions; and to uncover, to some extent, the fundamental unity
 from which they all spring; finally, to show that the occult side
 of Nature has never been approached by the Science of modern civilization.
 </p><p>
 If this is in any degree accomplished, the writer is content.
 It is written in the service of humanity, and by humanity and
 the future generations it must be judged. Its author recognises
 no inferior court of appeal. Abuse she is accustomed to; calumny
 she is daily acquainted with; at slander she smiles in silent
 contempt.
