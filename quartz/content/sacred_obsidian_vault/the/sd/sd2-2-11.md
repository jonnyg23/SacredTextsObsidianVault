 <h3>ยง XXIV. </h3>
 
 <h4>THE CROSS AND THE PYTHAGOREAN DECADE.</h4>
 
 <p>
 <strong>T</strong>HE early Gnostics claimed that their Science,
 the <strong>G</strong>NOSIS, rested on a square, the angles of
 which represented respectively <em>Sige</em> (Silence), <em>Bythos
 </em>(depth),<em> Nous </em>(Spiritual Soul or Mind), and <em>Aletheia
 </em>(Truth).
 </p><p>
 It is they who were the first to introduce and reveal to the world
 that which had remained concealed for ages: namely, the <em>Tau,
 </em>in the shape of a Procrustean bed, and Christos as incarnating
 in <em>Chrestos,</em> he who became for certain purposes a willing
 candidate for a series of tortures, mental and physical.
 </p><p>
 For them the whole of the Universe, metaphysical and material,
 was contained within, and could be expressed and described by
 the digits of Number 10, the Pythagorean <em>decade</em>.
 </p><p>
 This Decade representing the Universe and its evolution out of
 Silence and the <em>unknown </em>Depths of the Spiritual Soul,
 or <em>anima mundi,</em> presented two sides or aspects to the
 student. It could be, and was at first so used and applied to
 the Macrocosm, after which it descended to the Microcosm, or Man.
 There was, then, the purely intellectual and metaphysical, or
 the "<em>inner</em> Science," and the as purely materialistic
 or "surface science," both of which could be expounded
 by and contained in the <em>Decade. </em>It could be studied,
 in short, from the Universals of Plato, and the inductive method
 of Aristotle. The former started from a divine comprehension,
 when the plurality proceeded from unity, or the digits of the
 decade appeared, but to be finally re-absorbed, lost in the infinite
 Circle. The latter depended on sensuous perception alone, when
 the Decade could be regarded either as the unity that multiplies,
 or matter which differentiates, its study being limited to the
 plane surface; to the Cross, or the <em>Seven</em> which proceeds
 from the ten -- or the perfect number, on Earth as in heaven.
 </p><p>
 This dual system was brought, together with the Decade, by Pythagoras
 from India. That it was that of the <em>Brachmans</em> and<em>
 Iranians</em>, as they are called by the ancient Greek philosophers,
 is warranted to us by the whole range of Sanskrit literature,
 such as the Puranas and the laws of Manu. In these "Laws"
 or "Ordinances of Manu," it is said that Brahma first
 creates "the <em>ten </em>lords of Being," the ten Prajapati
 or creative Forces; which ten produce "<em>seven</em>"
 other Manus, or, rather, as some <strong>MSS</strong>. have it,
 <em>Munin, </em>instead of Manun = "devotees," or holy
 Beings, which are the Seven Angels of the Presence in the</p><hr>

 <p>
 Western religion. This mysterious number Seven, born from the
 upper triangle <img src="sd1-113.jpg" align="BOTTOM">, the latter
 itself born from the apex thereof, or the Silent Depths of the
 unknown universal soul (<em>Sige </em>and<em> Bythos</em>)<em>,
 </em>is the sevenfold <em>Saptaparna </em>plant, born and manifested
 on the surface of the soil of mystery, from the threefold root
 buried deep under that impenetrable soil. This idea is fully elaborated
 in Vol. I. ยง "Primordial Substance and Divine Thought,"
 which the reader has to notice carefully, if he would grasp the
 metaphysical idea involved in the above symbol. In man as in nature,
 it is, according to the cis-Himalayan esoteric philosophy (which
 is that of the <em>original Manu </em>Cosmogony), the septenary
 division that is intended by Nature herself. The seventh principle
 (<em>purusha</em>)<em> </em>alone is the divine <strong>S</strong>ELF,
 strictly speaking; for, as said in Manu, "He (Brahma) having
 pervaded the subtile parts of those six of unmeasured brightness,"
 created or called them forth to "Self"-consciousness
 or the consciousness of that <em>One</em> <strong>S</strong>ELF
 (V. 16, ch. i. <em>Manu</em>)<em>. </em>Of these six, five elements
 (or principles, or <em>Tattva, </em>as Medhatithi, the commentator
 thinks) "are called the atomic destructible elements"
 (v. 27); they are described in the above-named section.
 </p><p>
 We have now to speak of the Mystery language, that of the prehistoric
 races. It is not a phonetic, but a purely pictorial and symbolical
 tongue. It is known at present in its fulness to the very few,
 having become with the masses for more than 5,000 years an absolutely
 dead language. Yet most of the learned Gnostics, Greeks and Jews,
 knew it, and used it, though very differently. A few instances
 may be given.
 </p><p>
 On the plane above, the Number is no Number but a <em>nought --
 </em>a CIRCLE. On the plane below, it becomes <em>one</em> --
 which is an odd number. Each letter of the ancient alphabets having
 had its philosophical meaning and <em>raison d</em>'<em>etre,
 </em>the number I signified with the Alexandrian Initiates a<em>
 body erect, </em>a living standing man, he being the only animal
 that has this privilege. And, by adding to the I a head, it was
 transformed into a P, a symbol of <em>paternity, </em>of the creative
 potency; while R signified a "moving man," one on his
 way. Hence <strong>P</strong>ATER <strong>Z</strong>EUS had nothing
 sexual or phallic either in its sound or form of letters; nor
 had [[<em>pater Deus</em>]] (<em>vide</em> Ragon). If we turn
 now to the Hebrew Alphabet, we shall find that while I or aleph,
 <img src="sd1-78b.gif" align="BOTTOM">, has a bull or an Ox for
 its symbol, 10, the perfect number, or <em>One</em> of the Kabala
 is a <em>Yodh <img src="sd1-78c.gif" align="BOTTOM"> (y, i, or
 j); and means, as the first letter of Jehovah, the procreative
 organ, et seq.</em> 
 </p><p>
 The <em>odd</em> numbers are divine, the <em>even</em> numbers
 are terrestrial, devilish, and unlucky. The Pythagoreans hated
 the binary. With them it was the origin of differentiation, hence
 of contrasts, discord, or matter, the beginning of evil. In the
 Valentinian theogony, Bythos and Sige (Depth, Chaos, matter born
 in Silence) are the primordial binary.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 575 THE THREE SCIENCES. </h6>
 
 <p>
 With the early Pythagoreans, however, the duad was that imperfect
 state into which the first manifested being fell when it got detached
 from the Monad. It was the point from which the two roads -- the
 Good and the Evil -- bifurcated. All that which was double-faced
 or false was called by them "binary." <strong>O</strong>NE
 was alone Good, and Harmony, because no disharmony can proceed
 from one alone. Hence the Latin word<em> Solus </em>in relation
 to one and only God, the Unknown of Paul. <em>Solus, </em>however,
 very soon became <em>Sol</em> -- the Sun.
 </p><p>
 The ternary is thus the first of the odd numbers, as the triangle
 is the first of the geometrical figures. This number is truly
 the number of mystery <em>par excellence. </em>To study it on
 the exoteric lines one has to read Ragon's <em>Cours Interpretatif
 des Initiations; </em>on the esoteric -- the Hindu symbolism of
 numerals; as the combinations which were applied to it are numberless.
 It is on the occult properties of the three equal lines or sides
 of the Triangle that Ragon based his studies and founded the famous
 masonic society of the Trinosophists (those who study <em>three</em>
 <em>sciences; </em>an improvement upon the ordinary three masonic
 degrees, given to those who study nothing except eating and drinking
 at the meetings of their lodges). "The first line of the
 triangle offered to the apprentice for study," writes the
 founder, -- "is the mineral kingdom, symbolized by Tubalc
 . . . (Tubal-cain). The second side on which the '<em>companion</em>'
 has to meditate, is the <em>vegetable </em>kingdom, symbolized
 by Schibb <img src="sd2-575.gif" align="BOTTOM"> (Schibboleth).
 In this kingdom begins the <em>generation of the bodies. </em>This
 is why the letter G is presented radiant before the eyes of the
 adept (? !). The third side is left to the master mason, who has
 to complete his education by the study of the <em>animal kingdom.
 </em>It is symbolized by <em>Maoben <img src="sd2-575.gif" align="BOTTOM">
 </em>(Sun of putrefaction)" etc., etc.
 </p><p>
 The first solid figure is the <em>Quaternary, </em>symbol of immortality.
 It is the<em> pyramid: </em>for the pyramid stands on a triangular,
 square, or polygonal base, and terminates with a point at the
 top, thus yielding the triad and the quaternary or the 3 and 4.
 It is the Pythagoreans who taught the connection and relation
 between the gods and the numbers -- in a Science called <em>arithmomancy.
 </em>The Soul is a number, they said, which moves of itself and
 contains the number 4; and spiritual and physical man is number
 3, as the <em>ternary </em>represented for them not only the surface
 but also the principle of the formation of the physical body.
 Thus animals were <em>ternaries </em>only, man alone being a septenary,
 <em>when</em> <em>virtuous;</em> a <em>quinary </em>when bad,
 for: --

 Number 5 was composed of a binary and a ternary, which binary
 threw everything in the perfect form into disorder and confusion.

 * The reason for it is simple, and was given in "<em>Isis
 Unveiled.</em>"<em> </em>In geometry, one line fails to represent
 a perfect body or figure, nor can two lines constitute a demonstratively
 perfect figure. The triangle alone is the first perfect figure.
 </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 576 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 <em>perfect man, </em>they said, <em>was a quaternary and a ternary,
 </em>or four material and three immaterial elements; which three
 spirits or elements we likewise find in 5, when it represents
 the <em>microcosm. </em>The latter is a compound of a binary directly
 relating to gross matter, and of three Spirits:
 </p><p>
 "since 5 is the ingenious union of two Greek accents <img src="sd2-576a.gif" align="BOTTOM">
 placed over vowels which have or have not to be <em>aspirated.
 </em>The first sign <img src="sd2-576b.gif" align="BOTTOM"> is
 called 'Strong Spirit' or superior Spirit, the spirit of God aspired
 (<em>spiratus</em>) and breathed by man. The second sign <img src="sd2-576c.gif" align="BOTTOM">
 the lower, is the <em>Spirit of Love,</em> representing the secondary
 Spirit; the third embraces the whole man. It is the <em>universal
 Quintessence, </em>the vital fluid or Life." (<em>Ragon.</em>)
 </p><p>
 The more mystic meaning of 5 is given in an excellent article
 by Mr. Subba Row, in "Five Years of Theosophy" (pp.
 110,<em> et seq.</em>)<em> -- </em>"The Twelve Signs of the
 Zodiac," in which he gives some rules that may help the inquirer
 to ferret out "the deep significance of ancient Sanskrit
 nomenclature in the old Aryan myths and allegories." Meanwhile,
 let us see what has been hitherto stated about the constellation
 Capricornus in theosophical publications, and what is known of
 it generally. Every one knows that <img src="sd2-576d.gif" align="BOTTOM">
 is the tenth sign of the Zodiac into which the Sun enters at the
 winter solstice, about December 21st. But very few are those who
 know -- even in India, unless they are initiated -- the real mystic
 connection which seems to exist, as we are told, between the names
 <em>Makara </em>and<em> Kumara. </em>The first means some amphibious
 animal called <em>flippantly </em>'crocodile,' as some Orientalists
 think, and the second is the title of the great patrons of Yogins
 (See "<em>Saiva Puranas,</em>")<em> </em>the Sons of,
 and even one with, Rudra (Siva); a Kumara himself. It is through
 their connection with Man that the Kumaras are likewise connected
 with the Zodiac. Let us try to find out what the word <em>Makara
 </em>means.
 </p><p>
 The word <em>Makara, </em>says the author of "<em>The Twelve
 Signs of the</em> <em>Zodiac,</em>"<em> </em>"contains
 within itself the clue to its correct interpretation. The letter
 <em>Ma </em>is equivalent to No. 5, and <em>Kara </em>means hand.
 Now in Sanskrit <em>Thribhujam </em>means a triangle, <em>bhujam</em>
 or<em> Karam </em>(both synonyms) being understood to mean a side.
 So <em>Makaram </em>or<em> Panchakaram </em>means a Pentagon"
 -- the five-pointed star or pentagon representing the five limbs
 of man.* Under the old system, we are told, Makara was the <em>eighth
 </em>instead of the tenth sign.** It is "intended to represent
 the faces of the Universe, and indicates that the Universe is
 bounded by <em>Pentagons,</em>"<em> </em>as the Sanskrit
 writers "speak also of
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * What is the meaning and the reason of this figure? Because,
 <em>Manas </em>is the <em>fifth</em> principle, and because the
 pentagon is the symbol of Man -- not only of the five-limbed,
 but rather of the <em>thinking, conscious </em>MAN<em>.</em> 
 </p><p>
 ** The reason for it becomes apparent when Egyptian symbology
 is studied. See further on.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 577 POSEION'S FIVE MINISTERS. </h6>
 
 <p>
 <em>Ashtadisa </em>or eight faces bounding Space," referring
 thus to the <em>loka-palas,</em> the eight points of the compass
 (the four cardinal and the four intermediate points) . . . "From
 an objective point of view the <em>Microcosm</em> is represented
 by the human body. <em>Makaram </em>may be taken to represent
 simultaneously both the microcosm and the macrocosm, as external
 objects of perception." (<em>pp. </em>113, 115)<em>.</em>
 
 </p><p>
 But the true esoteric sense of the word "Makara," does
 not mean "crocodile," in truth, at all, even when it
 is compared with the animal depicted on the Hindu Zodiac. For
 it has the head and the fore-legs of an antelope and the body
 and tail of a fish. Hence the tenth sign of the Zodiac has been
 taken variously to mean a shark, a dolphin, etc.; as it is the
 <em>vahan </em>of<em> Varuna, </em>the Ocean God, and is often
 called, for this reason, <em>Jala-rupa </em>or "water-form."
 The dolphin was the vehicle of Poseidon-Neptune with the Greeks,
 and one with him, esoterically; and this "dolphin" is
 the "sea-dragon" as much as the Crocodile of the Sacred
 Nile is the vehicle of Horus, and Horus himself. "I am the
 fish and seat of the great Horus of Kem-our," says the mummy-form
 God with the crocodile's head (<em>ch. lxxxviii.,</em> 2<em>,
 </em>"<em>Book of the Dead</em>")<em>. </em>With the
 Peratae Gnostics it is <em>Chozzar </em>(Neptune), who converts
 into a sphere the dodecagonal pyramid, "and paints its gate
 with many colours." He has FIVE <em>androgyne </em>ministers
 -- he <em>is Makara, </em>the Leviathan.
 </p><p>
 The rising Sun being considered the Soul of the Gods sent to manifest
 itself to men every day, and the crocodile rising out of the water
 at the first sunbeam, that animal came finally to personify a
 Solar-fire devotee in India, as it personified that fire, or the
 highest soul with the Egyptians.
 </p><p>
 In the Puranas, the number of the <em>Kumaras </em>changes according
 to the exigencies of the allegory. For occult purposes their number
 is given in one place as seven, then as four, then as five. In
 the <em>Kurma Purana</em> it is said of them: "These <em>five
 </em>(<em>Kumara</em>)<em>, </em>O Brahman, were Yogins who acquired
 entire exemption from passion." Their very name shows their
 connection with the said constellation -- the <em>Makara, </em>and
 with some other Puranic characters connected with the Zodiacal
 signs. This is done in order to veil what was one of the most
 suggestive glyphs of the primitive Temples. They are mixed up
 astronomically, physiologically, and mystically, in general, with
 a number of Puranic personages and events. Hardly hinted at in
 the "<em>Vishnu,</em>"<em> </em>they figure in various
 dramas and events throughout all the other Puranas and sacred
 literature; so that the Orientalists, having to pick up the threads
 of connection hither and thither, have ended by proclaiming the
 Kumaras "due chiefly to the fancy of the Puranic writers."
 But --
 </p><p>
 <em>Ma, -- </em>we are told by the author of the "Twelve
 Signs of the Zodiac" -- is<em> Five; kara, </em>a hand with
 its five fingers, as also a five-sided sign or</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 578 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 a<em> pentagon. </em>The<em> Kumara </em>(in this case an anagram
 for occult purposes) are <em>five </em>in esotericism, as Yogis
 -- because the last two names have ever been kept secret; they
 are the fifth order of Brahmadevas, and the fivefold Chohans,
 having the soul of the five elements in them, Water and Ether
 predominating, and therefore their symbols were <em>both aquatic
 and</em> <em>fiery</em>. "Wisdom lies concealed under the
 couch of him who rests on the golden lotos (<em>padma</em>)<em>
 </em>floating on the water." In India it is Vishnu (one of
 whose avatars was Budha, as claimed in days of old). The Prachetasas,
 the worshippers of Narayana (who, like Poseidon moved or dwelt
 <em>over </em>not under the waters), plunged into the depths of
 the ocean for their devotions and remained therein 10,000 years;
 and the Prachetasas are <em>ten </em>exoterically, but <em>five</em>,
 esoterically. "Prachetas" is in Sanskrit, the name of
 Varuna, the water god, Nereus, an aspect of the same as Neptune,
 the Prachetasas being thus identical with the "<em>five</em>
 ministers" of [[<em>CHOZZAR</em>]] (Poseidon) of the Peratae
 Gnostics. These are respectively called [[<em>AOT, AOAI, OTO,
 OTOB</em>]], "the <em>fifth,</em> a<em> triple </em>name
 (making Seven) being lost"* -- <em>i.e.</em>, kept secret.
 This much for the "aquatic" symbol; the "fiery"
 connecting them with the fiery symbol -- spiritually. For purposes
 of identity, let us remember that as the mother of the Prachetasas
 was Savarna, the daughter of the Ocean, so was Amphitrite the
 mother of Neptune's mystic "ministers."
 </p><p>
 Now the reader is reminded that these "five ministers"
 are symbolized both in the Dolphin, who had overcome the chaste
 Amphitrite's unwillingness to wed Poseidon, and in Triton their
 son. The latter, whose body above the waist is that of a man and
 below a dolphin, a fish, is, again, most mysteriously connected
 with Oannes, the Babylonian <em>Dag</em>, and further also with
 the (fish) Avatar of Vishnu, <em>Matsya, </em>both teaching mortals
 <em>Wisdom. </em>The Dolphin, as every mythologist knows, was
 placed for his service by Poseidon among the constellations, and
 became with the Greeks, <em>Capricornus, </em>the goat, whose
 hind part is that of a dolphin, thus shown identical with <em>Makara,
 </em>whose head is also that of an antelope and the body and tail
 those of a fish. This is why the sign of the Makara was borne
 on the banner of Kama deva, the Hindu god of love, identified,
 in Atharva Veda, with Agni (the fire-god), the son of Lakshmi,
 as correctly given by Harivansa. For Lakshmi and Venus are one,
 and Amphitrite is the early form of Venus. Now Kama (the <em>Makara-ketu</em>)
 is "Aja" (the unborn), and "Atma-bhu" (the
 self-existent), and Aja is the <strong>L</strong>OGOS in the Rig-Veda,
 as he is shown therein to be the first manifestation of the <strong>O</strong>NE:
 "Desire first arose in <strong>I</strong>T, which was the
 primal
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * So is Brahma's <em>fifth</em> head, said to be lost, burnt to
 ashes by Siva's "central eye"; Siva being also <em>panchanana
 </em>"five faced." Thus the number is preserved and
 secresy maintained on the true esoteric meaning.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 579 THE PUZZLES OF SYMBOLISM. </h6>
 
 <p>
 germ of mind," that "which connects entity with non-entity"
 (or Manas, the <em>fifth,</em> with Atma, the <em>seventh, </em>esoterically)
 say the Sages. This is<em> the first stage. </em>The second, on
 the following plane of manifestation, shows Brahma (whom we select
 as a representative for all the other first gods of the nations)
 as causing to issue from his body his mind-born sons, "Sanandana
 and others," who, in the <em>fifth</em> "creation,"
 and again in the ninth (for purposes of blind) become the Kumara.
 Let us close by reminding the reader that goats were sacrificed
 to Amphitrite and the Nereids on the sea-shore, as goats are sacrificed
 to this day to Durga Kali, who is only the <em>black </em>side
 of Lakshmi (Venus), the <em>white</em> side of Sakti; and by suggesting
 what connection these animals may have with Capricornus, in which
 appear twenty-eight stars in the form of a goat, which goat was
 transformed by the Greeks into Amalthaea -- Jupiter's foster-mother.
 Pan, the god of Nature, had goat's feet, and changed himself into
 a goat at the approach of Typhon. But this is a mystery which
 the writer dares not dwell upon at length, not being sure of being
 understood. Thus the mystical side of the interpretation must
 be left to the intuition of the student. Let us note one more
 thing in relation to the mysterious number five. It symbolizes
 at one and the same time the Spirit of life eternal and the Spirit
 of life and love terrestrial -- in the human compound; and, it
 includes divine and infernal magic, and the universal and the
 individual quintessence of being. Thus, the five mystic words
 or vowels (<em>vide infra</em>)<em> </em>uttered by Brahma at
 "creation," which forthwith became the <em>Panchadasa
 </em>(certain Vedic hymns, attributed to that God) are in their
 creative and magical potentiality, the <em>white</em> side of
 the <em>black </em>Tantrik <em>five</em> "makaras,"
 or the five<em> m</em>'<em>s. </em>"Makara," the constellation,
 is a seemingly meaningless and absurd name. Yet, even besides
 its anagrammatical significance in conjunction with the term "Kumara,"
 the numerical value of its first syllable and its esoteric resolution
 into <em>five</em> has a very great and occult meaning in the
 mysteries of nature.
 </p><p>
 Suffice it to say, that as the sign of Makara is connected with
 the birth of the spiritual "microcosm," and the death
 or dissolution of the physical Universe (its passage into the
 realm of the Spiritual)*; so the Dhyan Chohans, called in India
 <em>Kumara, </em>are connected with both. Moreover, in the exoteric
 religions, they have become the synonyms of the Angels of Darkness.
 <em>Mara </em>is the God of Darkness, the Fallen One, and Death**;
 and yet it is one of the names of Kama, the first god in the Vedas,
 the Logos, from whom have sprung the Kumaras, and this

 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * "When the Sun passes away behind the 30th degree of <em>Makara
 </em>and will reach no more the sign of the <em>Meenam </em>(pisces)
 then the night of Brahma has come." . . .
 </p><p>
 ** Death of every physical thing truly; but Mara is also the unconscious
 quickener of the birth of the Spiritual.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 580 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 connects them still more with our "fabulous" Indian
 Makara, and the crocodile-headed God in Egypt.* The crocodiles
 in the Celestial Nile are <em>Five</em>, and the God Toum, the
 primordial deity creating the heavenly bodies and the living beings,
 calls forth these crocodiles in his <em>fifth</em> <em>creation.
 </em>When Osiris, "the defunct Sun," is buried and enters
 into Amenti, the sacred crocodiles plunge into the abyss of primordial
 Waters -- "the great Green One." When the Sun of life
 rises, they re-emerge out of the sacred river. All this is highly
 symbolical, and shows how primeval esoteric truths found their
 expression in identical symbols. But, as Mr. T. Subba Row truly
 declares, "The veil, that was dexterously thrown over certain
 portions of the mystery connected with the (Zodiacal) signs by
 the ancient philosophers, <em>will never be fully lifted up for
 the</em> <em>amusement or edification of the uninitiated public.</em>"
 </p><p>
 Nor was number five less sacred with the Greeks. The five words
 (<em>Panchadasa</em>)<em> </em>of Brahma have become with the
 Gnostics the "Five Words" written upon the akasic (shining)
 garment of Jesus at his glorification: the words [[<em>ZAMA ZAMA
 OZZA PAXAMA, OZAI</em>]], translated by the Orientalists "the
 robe, the glorious robe of my strength." These words were,
 in their turn, the anagrammatic blind of the five mystic powers
 represented on the robe of the "resurrected" Initiate
 after his last trial of three days' trance; the five becoming
 seven only after his <em>death,</em> when the Adept became the
 full <strong>C</strong>HRISTOS, the full <strong>K</strong>RISHNA-<strong>V</strong>ISHNU,
 <em>i.e.</em>, merged in Nirvana. The E <em>Delphicum, </em>a
 sacred symbol, was the numeral <em>five</em>, again; and how sacred
 it was is shown by the fact that the Corinthians (according to
 Plutarch) replaced the wooden numeral in the Delphic Temple by
 a bronze one; and this one was transmuted by Livia Augusta into
 a <em>fac-simile </em>of gold.
 </p><p>
 It is easy to recognize in the two spirits -- the Greek accents
 or signs (<img src="sd2-576a.gif" align="BOTTOM">) spoken of by
 Ragon (<em>vide supra</em>)<em> </em>-- Atma and Buddhi, or "divine
 spirit and its vehicle" (spiritual soul).
 </p><p>
 The <em>six </em>or the "Senary" is dealt with later,
 while the Septenary will be fully treated in the course of this
 volume. (<em>Vide the </em>"<em>Mysteries of</em> <em>the
 Hebdomad.</em>")
 </p><p>
 The<em> Ogdoad </em>or 8 symbolizes the eternal and spiral motion
 of cycles, the 8, <img src="sd2-580.gif" align="BOTTOM">, and
 is symbolized in its turn by the Caduceus. It shows the regular
 breathing of the Kosmos presided over by the eight great gods
 -- the seven from the primeval Mother, the One and the Triad.
 </p><p>
 Then comes the number nine or the triple ternary. It is the number
 which reproduces itself incessantly under all shapes and figures
 in
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * Osiris is called in the "<em>Book of the Dead</em>"<em>
 </em>"<em>Osiris, </em>the double Crocodile." (<em>See</em>
 <em>Chapter </em>"<em>On the Names of Osiris,</em>"<em>
 cxlii.</em>)<em> </em>"He is the good and the bad Principle;
 the Day, and the Night Sun, the God, and the mortal man."
 Thus far the Macrocosm and the Microcosm. </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 581 THE MASTER MASON'S GRIP. </h6>
 
 <p>
 every multiplication. It is the sign of every circumference, since
 its value in degrees is equal to 9, <em>i.e., </em>to 3 + 6 +
 0. It is a <em>bad</em> number under certain conditions, and very
 unlucky. If number 6 was the symbol of our globe ready to be animated
 by <em>a divine spirit, </em>9 symbolized our earth informed by
 a <em>bad </em>or evil spirit.
 </p><p>
 <em>Ten, </em>or the Decade, brings all these digits back to unity,
 and ends the Pythagorean table. Hence this figure -- <img src="sd2-581.gif" align="BOTTOM">,
 <em>unity within zero -- </em>was the symbol of Deity, of the
 Universe, and of man. Such is the secret meaning of "the
 strong grip of the Lion's paw, of the tribe of Judah" between
 two hands (the "<em>master mason</em>'<em>s grip</em>")<em>,
 </em>the joint number of whose fingers is <em>ten.</em> 
 </p><p>
 If we now give our attention to the Egyptian cross, or the <em>Tau,
 </em>we may discover this letter, so exalted by Egyptians, Greeks,
 and Jews, to be mysteriously connected with the <em>Decade. </em>The<em>
 tau </em>is the Alpha and the Omega of secret divine Wisdom, which
 is symbolized by the initial and the final letter of Thot (Hermes).
 Thot was the inventor of the Egyptian alphabet, and the letter
 <em>tau </em>closed the alphabets of the Jews and the Samaritans,
 who called this character the "end" or "perfection,"
 "culmination" and "security." Thence -- Ragon
 tells us -- the words <em>terminus </em>(end), and <em>tectum
 </em>(roof), are symbols of shelter and security, which is rather
 a prosaic definition. But such is the usual destiny of ideas and
 things in this world of spiritual decadence, if also of physical
 progress. <strong>P</strong>AN was at one time <em>absolute nature,
 </em>the one and <strong>G</strong>REAT-ALL; but when history
 catches a first glimpse of him, Pan has already tumbled down into
 a <em>godling </em>of the fields, a rural god; and history will
 not recognize him, while theology makes of him the devil. Yet
 his seven-piped flute, the emblem of the seven forces of nature,
 of the seven planets, the seven musical notes, of all the septenary
 harmony, in short, shows well his primordial character. So with
 the Cross. Far earlier than the Jews had devised their golden
 candlestick of the temple with <em>three </em>sockets on one side
 and <em>four </em>on the other, and made of number 7 a feminine
 number of generation,* thus introducing

 <p>
 * Reflecting on the <em>Cross, </em>the author of the "Source
 of Measures" shows that this candlestick in the temple "was
 so composed that counting on either side there were <em>four </em>candle-sockets;
 while at the apex, there being <em>one in common </em>to both
 sides, there were in fact <em>three </em>to be counted on the
 one side and four on the other, making in all number 7 upon the
 self-same idea of <em>one in common w</em>ith the cross display.
 Take a line of one unit in breadth by three units long, and place
 it on an incline; take another of four units long, and lean it
 upon this one, from an opposite incline, making the top unit of
 the four in length the corner or apex of a triangle. This is the
 display of the candlestick. Now take away the line of three units
 in length and <em>cross </em>it on the one of four units in length,
 and the cross form results. The same idea is conveyed in the six
 days of the week in Genesis, crowned by the seventh, which was
 used by itself as a base of circular measure" (p. 51).</p><hr>

 <p>
 the phallic element into religion, the more spiritually-minded
 nations had made of the cross (as 3, 4 = 7), their most sacred
 divine symbol. In fact, Circle, Cross, and Seven -- the latter
 being made a base of <em>circular </em>measurement -- are the
 first primordial symbols. Pythagoras, who brought his wisdom from
 India, left to posterity a glimpse into this truth. His school
 regarded number 7 as a compound of numbers 3 and 4, which they
 explained in a dual manner. On the plane of the noumenal world,
 the triangle was, as the first conception of the manifested Deity,
 its image: "Father-Mother-Son"; and the Quaternary,
 the perfect number, was the noumenal, ideal root of all numbers
 and things on the physical plane. Some students, in view of the
 sacredness of Tetraktis and the Tetragrammaton, mistake the mystic
 meaning of the Quaternary. The latter was with the ancients <em>only
 a secondary</em> "perfection," so to speak, because
 it related only to the manifested planes. Whereas it is the <em>Triangle,
 </em>the Greek <em>delta, <img src="sd1-113.jpg" align="BOTTOM">,
 which was the "vehicle of the unknown Deity." A good
 proof of it lies with the name of the Deity beginning with Delta.
 Zeus </em>was written [[<em>Deus</em>]], by the Boeotians,* thence
 the <em>Deus </em>of the Latins. This, in relation to the metaphysical
 conception, with regard to the meaning of the Septenary <em>in
 the phenomenal world, </em>but for purposes of profane or exoteric
 interpretation, the symbolism changed. <em>Three</em> became the
 ideograph of the <em>three material elements -- </em>air, water,
 earth; and four became the principle of all that which is neither
 corporeal nor perceptible. But this has never been accepted by
 the real Pythagoreans. Viewed as a compound of 6 and 1, the <em>senary
 </em>and the <em>unity, </em>number seven was the invisible centre,
 the spirit of everything (see further the explanation of 6), as
 there exists no body with six lines constituting its form without
 a <em>seventh</em> being found as the central point in it (see
 crystals and snow-flakes in so-called <em>inanimate </em>nature).
 Moreover, number <em>seven</em>, they said, has all the perfection
 of the <strong>U</strong>NIT -- the number of numbers. For as
 absolute unity is uncreated, and impartite (hence number-less)
 and no number can produce it, so is the seven: no digit contained
 within the decade can beget or produce it. And it is 4, which
 affords an arithmetical division between <em>unity</em> and<em>
 seven, </em>as it surpasses the former by the same number (three),
 as it is itself surpassed by the seven, since <em>four </em>is
 by as many numbers above <em>one, </em>as<em> seven </em>is above
 <em>four</em>. (From a <strong>MS</strong>. supposed to be by
 "St. Germain.")
 </p><p>
 "With the Egyptians number 7 was the symbol <em>of life </em>eternal,"
 says Ragon, and adds that this is why the Greek letter Z, which
 is but a double 7 is the initial letter of <em>Zao, </em>"I
 live," and of Zeus, "the father of all living."

 <p>
 Moreover, figure 6 was the symbol of the Earth during the autumn
 and winter "sleeping" months, and figure 7 during spring
 and summer, -- as the Spirit of life animated her at that time
 -- the seventh or central informing Force. We find the same in
 the Egyptian mythos and symbol of Osiris and Isis, personifying
 Fire and Water <em>metaphysically, </em>and the Sun and the Nile
 <em>physically. </em>The number of the Solar year, 365 in days,
 is the numerical value of the word <em>Neilos </em>(Nile). This,
 together with the Bull, with the Crescent and the ansated cross
 between its horns, and the Earth under its astronomical symbol
 -- <img src="sd2-29c.gif" align="BOTTOM"> -- are the most phallic
 symbols of later antiquity.
 </p><p>
 "The Nile was the river of time with the number of a year,
 or year and a day (364 + 1 = 365). It represented the parturient
 water of Isis, or Mother Earth, the moon, the woman, and the cow,
 also the <em>workshop </em>of Osiris, representing the <em>T</em>'<em>sod
 Olaum </em>of the Hebrews. The ancient name of this river was
 Eridanus, or the Hebrew Iardan, with the Coptic or old Greek suffix.
 This was the door of the Hebrew word Jared, or '<em>Source,</em>'<em>
 </em>or<em> Descent </em>. . . of the river Jordan, which had
 the same mythical use with the Hebrews that the Nile had with
 the Egyptians,* it was the source of descent, and held the waters
 of life" (Unpub. <strong>MS</strong>.) It was, to put it
 plainly, the symbol of the personified Earth, or Isis, regarded
 as the womb of that Earth. This is shown clearly enough; and Jordan
 -- the river so sacred now to Christians -- held no more sublime
 or poetical meaning in it than the parturient waters of the moon
 (Isis, or Jehovah in his female aspect). Now, as shown by the
 same scholar, Osiris was the sun, and the river Nile, and the
 tropical year of 365 days; while Isis was the moon, the bed of
 that river, or the mother earth "for the parturient energies,
 of which water was a necessity," as also the lunar year of
 354 days, "the time-maker of the periods of gestation."
 All this then is sexual and phallic, and our modern scholars seem
 to find in these symbols nothing beyond a physiological or phallic
 meaning. Nevertheless, the three figures 365, or the number of
 days in a solar year, have but to be read with the Pythagorean
 Key to find in them a highly philosophical and moral meaning.
 One instance will be sufficient. It can read:
 </p><p>
 <em>The Earth -- animated by -- the Spirit of Life.</em> 
 </p><p>
 ...... 3 .................. 6 ........................ 5
 </p><p>
 Simply because 3 is equivalent to the Greek <em>gamma,</em> or
 [[<em>G</em>]], which letter is the symbol of <em>gaia </em>(the
 Earth); while the figure 6 is the symbol of the animating or informing
 <em>principle, </em>and the 5 is the universal quintessence which
 spreads in every direction and forms all matter. (St. Germain's
 <strong>MS</strong>.)

 * It had no such meaning in the beginnings; nor during the earlier
 dynasties.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 584 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 The few instances and examples brought forward reveal only one
 small portion of the methods used to read the symbolical ideographs
 and numerals of antiquity. The system being of an extreme and
 complex difficulty, very few, even among the Initiates, could
 master <em>all</em> the seven keys. Is it to be wondered, then,
 that the metaphysical gradually dwindled down into the physical
 nature; that the Sun, once upon a time the symbol of <strong>D</strong>EITY,
 became, as aeons glided by, that of its creative ardour only;
 and that thence it fell into a glyph of phallic significance?
 But surely, it is not those whose method was (like Plato's) to
 proceed from the universals down to the particulars, who could
 ever have begun by symbolizing their religions by sexual emblems!
 It is quite true, though uttered by that incarnated paradox, Eliphas
 Levi, that "man is God on Earth, and God is man in Heaven."
 But this could not, and never did apply to the One Deity, only
 to the Hosts of <strong>I</strong>TS incarnated beams, called
 by us Dhyan Chohans, by the ancients, Gods; and now transformed
 by the Church into devils on the <em>left, </em>and into the Saviour
 on the <em>right </em>side!
 </p><p>
 But all such dogma grew out of the one root, the root of wisdom,
 which grows and thrives on the Indian soil. There is not an Archangel
 that could not be traced back to its prototype in the sacred land
 of Aryavarta. These "prototypes" are all connected with
 the Kumaras who appear on the scene of action by <em>refusing</em>
 -- as<em> </em>Sanatkumara and Sananda -- to "create progeny."
 Yet they are called the "creators" of (thinking) man.
 More than once they are brought into connection with Narada --
 another bundle of <em>apparent</em> incongruities, yet a wealth
 of philosophical tenets. Narada is the leader of the <em>Gandharvas,</em>
 the celestial singers and musicians; <em>esoterically, </em>the
 reason for it is explained by the fact that the latter (<em>the
 Gandharvas</em>)<em> </em>are "the instructors of men in
 the secret sciences." It is they, who "loving the women
 of the Earth," disclosed to them the mysteries of creation;
 or, as in the Veda -- the "heavenly Gandharva" is a
 deity who knew and revealed the<em> secrets of heaven and divine
 truths, </em>in general. If we remember what is said of this class
 of Angels in Enoch and in the Bible, then the allegory is plain:
 their leader, Narada, while refusing to procreate, leads men to
 become gods. Moreover, all of these, as stated in the Vedas, are
 <em>Chhandaja </em>(will-born) or incarnated (in different Manvantaras)
 <em>of their own will; -- </em>and they are shown in exoteric
 literature as existing age after age; some being "cursed
 to be re-born," others, incarnating as a duty. Finally, as
 the Sanakadikas, the seven Kumaras who went to visit Vishnu on
 the "White Island" (<em>Sveta-dwipa</em>) the island
 inhabited by the Maha Yogins -- they are connected with <em>Sakadwipa
 </em>and the Lemurians and Atlanteans of the Third and Fourth
 Races.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 585 SEEMING CONTRADICTIONS. </h6>
 
 <p>
 In Esoteric Philosophy, the Rudras (Kumaras, Adityas, Gandharvas,
 Asuras, etc.) are the highest Dhyan Chohans or Devas as regards
 intellectuality. They are those who, owing to their having acquired
 by self-development the <em>five-fold</em> nature -- hence the
 sacredness of number <em>five</em> -- became independent of the
 pure <em>Arupa </em>devas. This is a mystery very difficult to
 realize and understand correctly. For, we see that those who were
 "obedient to law" are, equally with the <em>rebels,
 doomed to be reborn in every age. </em>Narada, the Rishi, is cursed
 by Brahma to incessant peripateticism on Earth, <em>i.e.</em>,
 to be constantly reborn. He is a rebel against Brahma, and yet
 has no worse fate than the <em>Jayas --</em> the<em> </em>twelve
 great <em>creative </em>gods produced by Brahma as <em>his assistants
 in the functions of creation. </em>For the latter, lost in meditation,
 only <em>forgot to create; </em>and for this, they are equally
 cursed by Brahma to be born in every <em>manvantara. </em>And
 still they are termed -- together with the rebels <em>-- Chhandajas,
 </em>or those born of their own will in human form!
 </p><p>
 All this is very puzzling to one who is unable to read and understand
 the Puranas except in their dead letter sense.* Hence we find
 the Orientalists refusing <em>to be puzzled, </em>and cutting
 the Gordian knot of perplexity by declaring the whole scheme "figments"
 "of Brahminical fancy and love of exaggeration." But
 to the student of occultism, the whole is pregnant with deeply
 philosophical meaning. We willingly leave the rind to the Western
 Sanskritist, but claim the essence of the fruit for ourselves.
 We do more: we concede that in one sense much in these so-called
 "fables" refers to astronomical allegories about constellations,
 asterisms, stars, and planets. Yet, while the <em>Gandharva</em>
 of the Rig-Veda may there be made to personify the fire of the
 Sun, the<em> Gandharva devas </em>are entities both of a physical
 and psychic character; while the Apsarasas (with other Rudras)
 are both <em>qualities</em> and<em> quantities. </em>In short,
 if ever unravelled, the theogony of the Vedic Gods will reveal
 fathomless mysteries of Creation and being. Truly says Parasara:
 "These thirty-three divinities exist age after age, and their
 appearance and disappearance is in the same manner as the sun
 sets and rises again." (Book I., xv.)
 </p><p>
 There was a time, when the Eastern symbol of the Cross and Circle,
 the<em> Swastica, </em>was universally adopted. With the esoteric
 (and, for the matter of that, exoteric) Buddhist, the Chinaman
 and the Mongolian, it means "the 10,000 truths." These
 truths, they say, belong to the

 * Yet this sense, if once mastered, will turn out to be the secure
 casket which holds the keys to the Secret Wisdom. True, a casket
 so profusely ornamented that its fancy work hides and conceals
 entirely any spring for opening it, and thus makes the unintuitional
 believe it has not, and cannot have, any opening in it. Still
 the Keys are there, deeply buried, yet ever present to him who
 searches for them.</p><hr>

 <p>
 mysteries of the unseen Universe and primordial Cosmogony and
 Theogony. "Since Fohat crossed the Circle like two lines
 of flame (horizontally and vertically), the hosts of the Blessed
 Ones have never failed to send their representatives upon the
 planets they are made to watch over from the beginning."
 This is why the <em>Swastica </em>is always placed -- as the ansated
 Cross was in Egypt -- on the breasts of the defunct mystics. It
 is found on the heart of the images and statues of Buddha, in
 Tibet and Mongolia. It is the <em>seal </em>placed also on the
 hearts of the living Initiates, burnt into the flesh, for ever,
 with some. This, because they have to keep those truths inviolate
 and intact, in eternal silence and secrecy to the day these are
 perceived and read by their chosen successors -- new Initiates
 -- "worthy of being entrusted with the ten thousand perfections."
 So degraded, however, has it now become, that it is often placed
 on the headgear of the "gods," the hideous idols of
 the sacrilegious <em>Bhons,</em> the<em> Dugpas </em>(Sorcerers)
 of the Tibetan borderlands; until found out by a <em>Galukpa </em>and
 torn off together with the head of the "god;" though
 it would be better were it that of the worshipper which was severed
 from the sinful body. Still, it can never lose its mysterious
 properties. Throw a retrospective glance, and see it used alike
 by the Initiates and Seers, as by the priests of Troy (found by
 Schliemann on the site of that old city). One finds it with the
 old Peruvians, the Assyrians, Chaldeans, as well as on the walls
 of the old-world cyclopean buildings; in the catacombs of the
 <em>New </em>world, and in those of the <em>Old</em> (?), at Rome,
 where, because the first Christians are supposed to have concealed
 themselves and their religion, it is called <em>Crux Dissimulata.</em>
 
 </p><blockquote>
 "According to de Rossi, the Swastica from an early period
 was a favourite form of the cross <em>employed with an occult
 signification, </em>which shows the secret was not that of the
 Christian cross. One Swastica cross in the catacombs is the sign
 of an inscription which reads [['<em>ZOTIKO ZOTIKE</em>]],' '<em>Vitalis
 Vitalia,</em>'<em> </em>or 'life of life.' "*

 But the best evidence to the antiquity of the cross is that which
 is brought forward by the author of <em>Natural Genesis </em>on
 page 433.
 </p><blockquote>
 "The value of the cross," says Mr. Massey, "as
 a Christian symbol, is supposed to date from the time when Jesus
 Christ was crucified. And yet in the 'Christian' <em>Iconography
 of the Catacombs no figure of a man appears</em> <em>upon the
 Cross during the first six or seven centuries. </em>There are
 all forms of the cross except that -- the alleged starting-point
 of the new religion. That was not the initial but the final form
 of the Crucifix.** During some six

 centuries after the Christian era the foundation of the Christian
 religion in a crucified Redeemer is entirely absent from Christian
 art! The earliest known form of the human figure on the cross
 is the crucifix presented by Pope Gregory the Great to Queen Theodolinde
 of Lombardy, now in the Church of St. John at Monza, whilst no
 image of the Crucified is found in the Catacombs at Rome earlier
 than that of San Giulio, belonging to the seventh or eighth century.
 . . . There is no Christ and no Crucified; the Cross is the Christ
 even as the Stauros cross was a type and a name of Horus, the
 Gnostic Christ. The Cross, not the Crucified, is the essential
 object of representation in its art, and of adoration in its religion.
 The germ of the whole growth and development can be traced to
 the cross. And that cross is pre-Christian, is pagan and heathen,
 in half a dozen different shapes. The cult began with the cross,
 and Julian was right in saying he waged a 'Warfare with the X';
 which he obviously considered had been adopted by the A-Gnostics
 and Mytholators to convey an impossible significance.* During
 centuries the cross stood for the Christ, and was addressed as
 if it were a living being. It was made divine at first, and humanized
 at last."
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 Few world-symbols are more pregnant with real occult meaning than
 the Swastica. It is symbolized by the figure 6; for, like that
 figure, it points in its concrete imagery, as the ideograph of
 the number does, to the Zenith and the Nadir, to North, South,
 West, and East; one finds the unit everywhere, and that unit reflected
 in all and every unit. It is the emblem of the activity of Fohat,
 of the continual revolution of the "wheels," and of
 the Four Elements, the "Sacred Four," in their mystical,
 and not alone in their cosmical meaning; further, its four arms,
 bent at right angles, are intimately related, as shown elsewhere,
 to the Pythagorean and Hermetic scales. One initiated into the
 mysteries of the meaning of the Swastica, say the Commentaries,
 "can trace on it, with mathematical precision, the evolution
 of Kosmos and the whole period of <em>Sandhya.</em>"<em>
 </em>Also "the relation of the Seen to the Unseen,"
 and "the first procreation of man and species."
 </p><p>
 To the Eastern Occultist the <strong>T</strong>REE of Knowledge
 in the Paradise of man's own heart, becomes the Tree of Life eternal,
 and has nought to do with man's animal senses. It is an absolute
 mystery that reveals itself only through the efforts of the imprisoned
 Manas and the Ego to liberate themselves from the thraldom of
 sensuous perception and see, in the light of the one eternal present
 Reality. To the Western Kabalist, and now far more to the superficial
 Symbologist, nursed in the lethal atmosphere of materialistic
 science, there is but one chief explanation of the mysteries of
 the Cross -- its sexual element. Even the otherwise spiritualistic
 modern commentator discerns in the Cross and Swastica, this feature
 before all others.

 This is perfect and no one can discern in this "sexual worship,"
 with which the Orientalists love to break the head of Paganism.
 But how about the Jews, and the exoteric religions of some Hindu
 sects, especially the rites of the Vallabacharyas? For, as said,
 the Lingham and Yoni of Siva-worship stand too high philosophically,
 its modern degeneration notwithstanding, to be called a simple
 phallic worship. But the <em>tree </em>or<em> Cross-</em>worship****<em>
 </em>of the Jews, as denounced by their own Prophets, can hardly
 escape the charge. The "Sons of Sorcerers," "the
 seed of the adulterer," as Isaiah calls them (lvii.), never
 lost an opportunity of "enflaming themselves with idols under
 every green tree," which denotes no metaphysical recreation.
 It is from these <em>monotheistic</em> Jews that the Christian
 nations have derived their religion, their "God of gods,
 the One living God," while despising and deriding the worship
 of the Deity of the ancient philosophers. Let such believe in
 and worship the physical form of the Cross, by all means.

 mystery in their Past, and it is to that Past alone that he directs
 his eager gaze. He cares little whether it be the seed from

 which grows the genealogical <em>Tree of Being, </em>called the
 Universe. Nor is it the Three in One, the triple aspect of the
 seed -- its form, colour, and substance -- that interest him,
 but rather the <strong>F</strong>ORCE which directs its growth,
 the ever mysterious, as the ever unknown. For this vital Force,
 that makes the seed germinate, burst open and throw out shoots,
 then form the trunk and branches, which, in their turn, bend down
 like the boughs of the <em>Aswattha, </em>the holy Tree of Bodhi,
 throw their seed out, take root and procreate other trees -- this
 is the only <strong>F</strong>ORCE that has reality for him, as
 it is the never-dying breath of life. The pagan philosopher sought
 for the Cause, the modern is content with only the effects and
 seeks the former in the latter. What is beyond, he does not know,
 nor does the modern <em>A-gnostic </em>care: thus rejecting the
 only knowledge upon which he can with full security base his Science.
 Yet this manifested Force has an answer for him who seeks to fathom
 it. He who sees in the cross, the decussated circle of Plato,
 the <em>Pagan, </em>not the antitype of circumcision, as <em>Christian
 </em>(St.) Augustine did,* is forthwith regarded by the Church
 as a heathen: by Science, as a lunatic. This because, while refusing
 to worship the god of physical generation, he confesses that he
 can know nothing of the Cause which underlies the so-called <em>First
 </em>Cause, the causeless Cause of this Vital Cause. Tacitly admitting
 the All-Presence of the boundless Circle and making of it the
 universal Postulate upon which the whole of the manifested universe
 is based, the Sage keeps a reverential silence concerning that
 upon which no mortal men should dare to speculate. "The Logos
 of God is the revealer of man, and the logos (the verb) of man
 is the revealer of God," says Eliphas Levi in one of his
 paradoxes. To this, the Eastern Occultist would reply: -- "On
 this condition, however, that man should be dumb on the CAUSE
 that produced both God and its logos. Otherwise, he becomes invariably
 the <em>reviler, </em>not the 'revealers' of the incognizable
 Deity."

 We have now to approach a mystery -- the Hebdomad in nature. Perchance,
 all that we may say, will be attributed to coincidence. We may
 be told that this number in nature is quite <em>natural </em>(so
 we say too), and has no more significance than the illusion of
 motion which forms the so-called "Strobic circles."
 No great importance was given to these "singular illusions"
 when Professor Sylvanus Thompson exhibited them at the meeting
 of the British Association in 1877. Nevertheless we should like
 to learn the scientific explanation why seven should ever form
 itself as a pre-eminent number -- six concentric circles around
 a seventh, and seven rings within one another round a central
 point, etc., etc. -- in this <em>illusion, </em>produced by a
 swaying saucer, or any other vessel. We give the solution refused
 by science in the section which follows.
