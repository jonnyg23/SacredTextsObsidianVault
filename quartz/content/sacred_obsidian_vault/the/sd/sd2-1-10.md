 But they had already <em>separated </em>before the ray of divine
 reason had enlightened the dark region of their hitherto slumbering
 minds, and had <em>sinned. </em>That is to say, they had committed
 evil unconsciously, by producing an effect which was unnatural.
 Yet, like the other six primitive brother or fellow races, even
 so this seventh, henceforth degenerated race, which will have
 to bide its time for its final development on account of the <em>sin</em>
 committed, -- even this race will <em>find itself on the last
 day </em>on one of the seven paths. For "the wise* guard
 the home of nature's order, they assume excellent forms in secret."**
 But we must see whether the "animals" tampered with,
 were of the same kind as those known to zoology.

 * This verse in the Veda (<em>X.</em> 5-6), "The seven wise
 ones (rays of wisdom, Dhyanis) fashion seven paths (or lines as
 also <em>Races </em>in another sense). To one of these may the
 distressed mortal come" -- which is interpreted solely from
 the astronomical and cosmic aspect -- is one of the most pregnant
 in occult meaning. The "paths" may mean lines (<em>maryadah</em>)<em>,
 </em>but they are primarily beams of light falling on the paths
 leading to wisdom. (See <em>Rig Veda </em><strong>IV</strong>.
 5-13.) It means "ways" or paths. They are, in short,
 the seven Rays which fall free from the macrocosmic centre, the
 seven principles in the metaphysical, the seven Races in the physical
 sense. All depends upon the key used.

 (<em>a</em>) The "Fall" occurred, according to the testimony
 of ancient Wisdom and the old records, as soon as Daksha (the
 reincarnated Creator of men and things in the early Third Race)
 disappeared to make room for that portion of mankind which had
 "separated." This is how the Commentary explains the
 details that preceded the "Fall": --
 </p><p>
 "<em>In the initial period of man</em>'<em>s Fourth evolution,
 the human kingdom branched off in several and various directions.
 The outward shape of its first specimens was not uniform, for
 the vehicles </em>(the egg-like, external shells, in which the
 future fully physical man gestated) <em>were often tampered with,
 before they hardened, by huge animals, of species now unknown,
 and which belonged to the tentative efforts of Nature. The result
 was that intermediate races of monsters, half animals, half men,
 were produced. But as they were failures, they were not allowed
 to breathe long and live, though the intrinsically paramount power
 of psychic over physical nature being yet very weak, and hardly
 established, the </em>'<em>Egg-Born</em>'<em> Sons had taken several
 of their females unto themselves as mates, and bred other human
 monsters. Later, animal species and human races becoming gradually
 equilibrized, they separated and mated no longer. Man created
 no</em> <em>more -- he begot. But he also begot animals, as well
 as</em> <em>men in</em> <em>days of old. Therefore the Sages </em>(<em>or
 wise men</em>)<em>, who speak of males who had no more</em> <em>will-begotten
 offspring, but begat various animals along with Danavas</em> (giants)
 <em>on females of other species -- animals being as </em>(<em>or
 in a manner of</em>)<em> Sons putative to them</em>;<em> and they
 </em>(the human males) <em>refusing in time to be regarded as
 </em>(putative) <em>fathers of dumb creatures </em>-- <em>spoke
 truthfully and wisely. Upon seeing this </em>(state of things),
 <em>the kings and Lords of the Last Races </em>(of the Third and
 the Fourth) <em>placed the seal of prohibition upon the sinful
 intercourse. It interfered with Karma</em>, <em>it developed new
 </em>(Karma)<em>.</em>*<em> They </em>(the divine Kings) <em>struck
 the culprits with sterility. They destroyed the Red and Blue Races.</em>**<em>
 </em>
 </p><p>
 In another we find: --
 </p><p>
 "<em>There were blue and red-faced animal-men even in later
 times</em>;<em> not from actual intercourse </em>(between the
 human and animal species), <em>but by descent.</em>"
 </p><p>
 And still another passage mentions: --
 </p><p>
 "<em>Red-haired, swarthy men going on all-fours, who bend
 and unbend </em>(stand erect and fall on their hands again) <em>who
 speak as their forefathers, and run on their hands as their giant
 fore-mothers.</em>"

 <p>
 <em>Homo primigenius, </em>but some of the lower tribes, such
 as some tribes of the Australian savages. Nevertheless, even these
 are not descended from the anthropoid apes, but from human fathers
 and semi-human mothers, or, to speak more correctly, from human
 monsters -- those "failures" mentioned in the first
 Commentary. The real anthropoids, Haeckel's <em>Catarrhini </em>and
 <em>Platyrrhini, </em>came far later, in the closing times of
 Atlantis. The orang-outang, the gorilla, the chimpanzee and cynocephalus
 are the latest and purely physical evolutions from lower anthropoid
 mammalians. They have a spark of the purely human essence in them;
 man on the other hand, has not one drop of pithecoid* blood in
 his veins. Thus saith old Wisdom and universal tradition.
 </p><p>
 How was the separation of sexes effected? it is asked. Are we
 to believe in the old Jewish fable of the rib of Adam yielding
 Eve? Even such belief is more logical and reasonable than the
 descent of man from the Quadrumana without any reservation; as
 the former hides an esoteric truth under a fabulous version, while
 the latter conceals no deeper fact than a desire to force upon
 mankind a materialistic fiction. The rib is bone, and when we
 read in Genesis that Eve was made out of the rib, it only means
 that the <em>Race with bones </em>was produced out of a previous
 Race and Races, which were "boneless." This is an esoteric
 tenet spread far and wide, as it is almost universal under its
 various forms. A Tahitian tradition states that man was created
 out of <em>Araea, </em>"red
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------

 <p>
 * This, regardless of modern materialistic evolution, which speculates
 in this wise: "The primitive human form, whence as we think
 all human species sprang, has perished this long time." (This
 we deny; it has only decreased in size and changed in texture.)
 "But many facts point to the conclusion that it was hairy
 and dolichocephalic." (African races are even <em>now</em>
 dolichocephalic in a great measure, but the palaeolithic Neanderthal
 skull, the oldest we know of, is of a large size, and no nearer
 to the capacity of the gorilla's cranium than that of any other
 now-living man). "Let us, for the time being, call this hypothetical
 species <em>Homo primigenius</em>. . . . This first species, or
 the Ape-man, the ancestor of all the others, PROBABLY arose in
 the <em>tropical regions </em>of the old world from ANTHROPOID
 APES." Asked for proofs, the evolutionist, not the least
 daunted, replies: "Of these NO FOSSIL REMAINS ARE AS YET
 KNOWN TO US, BUT THEY WERE <em>probably </em>AKIN TO THE <strong>G</strong>ORILLA
 AND <strong>O</strong>RANG OF THE PRESENT DAY." And then
 the Papuan negro is mentioned as the probable descendant in the
 first line (<em>Pedigree of Man, p</em>. 80).
 </p><p>
 Haeckel holds fast to Lemuria, which with East Africa and South
 Asia also, he mentions as the possible cradle of the primitive
 Ape-men; and so do many geologists. Mr. A. R. Wallace admits its
 reality, though in a rather modified sense, in his "<em>Geographical
 Distribution of Animals.</em>"<em> </em>But let not Evolutionists
 speak so lightly of the comparative size of the brains of man
 and the ape, for this is very <em>unscientific, </em>especially
 when they pretend to see no difference between the two, or very
 little at any rate. For Vogt himself showed that, while the highest
 of the Apes, the gorilla, has a brain of only 30 to 51 cubic inches,
 the brain of the lowest of the Australian aborigines amounts to
 99.35 cubic inches. The former is thus "not half of the size
 of the brain of a new-born babe," says Pfaff.</p><hr>

 <p>
 Earth." Taaroa, the creative power, the chief god, "put
 man to sleep for long years, for several lives," which means
 racial periods, and is a reference to his <em>mental sleep, </em>as
 shown elsewhere. During that time the deity pulled an<em> Ivi</em>
 (bone) out of man and she became a woman.*
 </p><p>
 Nevertheless, whatever the allegory may mean, even its exoteric
 meaning necessitates a <em>divine </em>Builder of man -- "a
 Progenitor." Do we then believe in such "supernatural"
 beings? We say, No. Occultism has never believed in anything,
 whether animate or inanimate, <em>outside </em>nature. Nor are
 we Cosmolators or Polytheists for believing in "Heavenly
 Man" and divine men, for we have the accumulated testimony
 of the ages, with its unvarying evidence on every essential point,
 to support us in this; the Wisdom of the Ancients and UNIVERSAL
 tradition. We reject, however, every groundless and baseless tradition,
 which, having outgrown strict allegory and symbolism, has found
 acceptance in exoteric creeds. But that which is preserved in<em>
 unanimous </em>traditions, only the wilfully blind could reject.
 Hence we believe in races of beings other than our own in far
 remote geological periods; in races of ethereal, following <em>incorporeal,
 </em>"<em>Arupa,</em>"<em> </em>men, with form but no
 solid substance, giants who preceded us pigmies; in dynasties
 of divine beings, those Kings and Instructors of the Third Race
 in arts and sciences, compared with which our little modern science
 stands less chance than elementary arithmetic with geometry.
 </p><p>
 No, certainly not. We do not believe in the <em>supernatural </em>but
 only in <em>the superhuman, </em>or rather <em>interhuman, </em>intelligences.
 One may easily appreciate the feeling of reluctance that an educated
 person would have to being classed with the superstitious and
 ignorant; and even realize the great truth uttered by Renan when
 he says that: "The supernatural has become like the original
 sin, a blemish that every one seems ashamed of -- even those most
 religious persons who refuse in our day to accept even a <em>minimum
 </em>of Bible miracles in all their crudeness, and who, seeking
 to reduce them to the <em>minimum, </em>hide and conceal it in
 the furthermost corners of the past."**
 </p><p>
 But the "supernatural" of Renan belongs to dogma and
 its dead letter. It has nought to do with its Spirit nor with
 the reality of facts in Nature. If theology asks us to believe
 that four or five thousand years ago men lived 900 years and more,
 that a portion of mankind, the enemies of the people of Israel
 exclusively, was composed of giants

 and monsters, we decline to believe that such a thing existed
 in Nature <em>5,000 years back. </em>For Nature never proceeds
 by jumps and starts, and logic and common sense, besides geology,
 anthropology and ethnology, have justly rebelled against such
 assertions. But if that same theology, giving up her fantastic
 chronology, had claimed that men lived 969 years -- the age of
 Methuselah -- five million years ago, we would have nothing to
 say against the claim. For in those days the physical frame of
 men was, compared to the present human body, as that of a megalosaurus
 to a common lizard.
 </p><p>
 A naturalist suggests another difficulty. The human is the only
 species which, however unequal in its races, can breed together.
 "There is no question of selection between <em>human races,</em>"<em>
 </em>say the anti-Darwinists, and no evolutionist can deny the
 argument -- one which very triumphantly proves <em>specific unity.
 </em>How then can Occultism insist that a portion of the Fourth
 Race humanity begot young ones from females of another, only <em>semi-human,
 </em>if not quite an animal, race, the hybrids resulting from
 which union not only bred freely but produced the ancestors of
 the modern anthropoid apes? Esoteric science replies to this that
 it was in the very beginnings of physical man. Since then, Nature
 has changed her ways, and sterility is the only result of the
 crime of man's bestiality. But we have to this day proofs of this.
 The Secret Doctrine teaches that the <em>specific unity of mankind
 </em>is not without exceptions even now. For there are, or rather
 still were a few years ago, descendants of these half-animal tribes
 or races, both of remote Lemurian and Lemuro-Atlantean origin.
 The world knows them as Tasmanians (now extinct), Australians,
 Andaman Islanders, etc. The descent of the Tasmanians can be almost
 proved by a fact, which struck Darwin a good deal, without his
 being able to make anything of it. This fact deserves notice.
 </p><p>
 Now de Quatrefages and other naturalists, who seek to prove Monogenesis
 by the very fact of every race of mankind being capable of crossing
 with every other, have left out of their calculations <em>exceptions</em>,
 which do not in this case confirm the rule. Human crossing may
 have been a general rule from the time of the separation of sexes,
 and yet that other law may assert itself, viz., sterility between
 two human races, just as between two animal species of various
 kinds, in those rare cases when a European, condescending to see
 in a female of a savage tribe a mate, happens to chose a member
 of such mixed tribes.* Darwin notes such
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * Of such semi-animal creatures, the sole remnants known to Ethnology
 were the Tasmanians, a <em>portion </em>of the Australians and
 a mountain tribe in China, the men and women of which are entirely
 covered with hair. They were the last descendants in a <em>direct
 </em>line of the semi-animal latter-day Lemurians referred to.
 There are, however, considerable numbers of the mixed Lemuro-Atlantean
 peoples produced by various [[Footnote continued on next page]]

 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 196 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 a case in a Tasmanian tribe, whose women were suddenly struck
 with sterility, <em>en masse, </em>some time after the arrival
 among them of the European colonists. The great naturalist tried
 to explain this fact by change of diet, food, conditions, etc.,
 but finally gave up the solution of the mystery. For the Occultist
 it is a very evident one. "Crossing," as it is called,
 of Europeans with Tasmanian women -- <em>i.e</em>., the representatives
 of a race, whose progenitors were a "soulless"* and
 mindless monster and a real human, though still as mindless a
 man -- brought on sterility. This, not alone as a consequence
 of a physiological law, but also as a decree of <em>Karmic </em>evolution
 in the question of further survival of the abnormal race. In no
 one point of the above is Science prepared to believe <em>as yet
 </em>-- but it will have to in the long run. Esoteric philosophy,
 let us remember, only fills the gaps made by science and corrects
 her false premises.
 </p><p>
 Yet, in this particular, geology and even botany and zoology support
 the esoteric teachings. It has been suggested by many geologists
 that the Australian native -- co-existing as he does with an <em>archaic
 fauna and flora -</em>- must date back to an enormous antiquity.
 The whole environment of this mysterious race, about whose origin
 ethnology is silent, is a testimony to the truth of the esoteric
 position.
 </p><h6>"It is a very curious fact," says Jukes,** "that
 not only these marsupial animals (the mammals found in the Oxfordshire
 stone-field slates), but several of the shells -- as for instance,
 the <em>Trigonias </em>and even some of the plants found fossil
 in the Oolitic rocks -- much more nearly resemble those now living
 in Australia than the living forms of any other part of the globe.
 This might be explained on the supposition that, since the 0olitic
 (Jurassic) period, <em>less change has taken place in Australia
 than elsewhere, </em>and that the Australian flora and fauna consequently
 retain. Some-</h6>

 [[Footnote continued from previous page]] crossings with such
 semi-human stocks -- <em>e.g.</em>, the wild men of Borneo, the
 Veddhas of Ceylon, classed by Prof. Flower among Aryans (!), most
 of the remaining Australians, Bushmen, Negritos, Andaman Islanders,
 etc.
 </p><p>
 The Australians of the Gulf of St. Vincent and the neighbourhood
 of Adelaide are <em>very hairy, </em>and the brown down on the
 skin of boys of five or six years of age assumes a <em>furry appearance.
 </em>They are, however, degraded <em>men</em> -- not the closest
 approximation to the<em> </em>"<em>pithecoid </em>man,"
 as Haeckel so sweepingly affirms. Only a portion of these men
 are a Lemurian relic. (Cf. "<em>Esoteric Buddhism,</em>"
 p<em>.</em>55.)
 </p><p>
 * In calling the animal "Soulless," it is not depriving
 the beast, from the humblest to the highest species, of a "soul,"
 but only of a conscious surviving <em>Ego-soul, i.e., </em>that
 principle which survives after a man, and reincarnates in a like
 man. The animal has an astral body, that survives the physical
 form for a short period; but its (animal) Monad does not re-incarnate
 in the same, but in a higher species, and has no "Devachan"
 of course. It has the <em>seeds </em>of all the human principles
 in itself, but they are <em>latent.</em>

 thing of the Oolitic type, <em>while it had been altogether supplanted
 and replaced on the rest of the Globe.</em>"<em> </em>(!
 !)
 </p><p>
 Now why has less change taken place in Australia than elsewhere?
 Where is the <em>raison d</em>'<em>etre </em>for such a "curse
 of retardation"? It is simply because the nature of the environment
 develops <em>pari passu </em>with the race concerned. Correspondences
 rule in every quarter. The survivors of those later Lemurians,
 who escaped the destruction of their fellows when the main continent
 was submerged, became the ancestors of a portion of the present
 native tribes. Being a very low sub-race, begotten originally
 of animals, of monsters, whose very fossils are now resting miles
 under the sea floors, their stock has since existed in an environment
 strongly subjected to the <em>law of retardation. </em>Australia
 is one of the oldest lands now above the waters, and in the senile
 decrepitude of old age, its "<em>virgin </em>soil" notwithstanding.
 It can produce no new forms, unless helped by new and fresh races,
 and artificial cultivation and breeding.
 </p><p>
 To return, however, once more to the history of the Third Race,
 the "Sweat-Born," the "Egg-bearing," and the
 "Androgyne." Almost sexless, in its early beginnings,
 it became bisexual or androgynous; very gradually of course. The
 passage from the former to the latter transformation required
 numberless generations, during which the simple cell that issued
 from the earliest parent (the two in one), first developed into
 a bisexual being; and then the cell, becoming a regular egg, gave
 forth a unisexual creature. The Third-Race-mankind is the most
 mysterious of all the hitherto developed five Races. The mystery
 of the "How" of the generation of the distinct sexes
 must, of course, be very obscure here, as it is the business of
 an embryologist and a specialist, the present work giving only
 faint outlines of the process. But it is evident that the units
 of the Third Race humanity began to separate in their pre-natal
 shells, or eggs,* and to issue out of them as distinct male and
 female babes, ages after the appearance of its early progenitors.
 And, as time rolled on its geological periods, the newly born
 sub-races began to lose their natal capacities. Toward the end
 of the fourth <em>sub-race, </em>the babe lost its faculty of
 walking as soon as liberated from its shell, and by the end of
 the fifth, mankind was born under the same conditions and by the
 same identical process as our historical generations. This required,
 of course, millions of years. The

 what it did in that of other animals. But this does not prevent
 man from having always stood at the head of the animal world and
 other organic species, and from having preceded the former.</p><hr>

 DEVELOPED <strong>S</strong>PEECH.
 </p><p>
 The Commentaries explain that the first Race -- the ethereal or
 astral Sons of Yoga, also called "Self-born" -- was,
 in our sense, speechless, as it was devoid of mind on our plane.
 The Second Race had a "Sound-language," to wit, chant-like
 sounds composed of vowels alone. The Third Race developed in the
 beginning a kind of language which was only a slight improvement
 on the various sounds in Nature, on the cry of gigantic insects
 and of the first animals, which, however, were hardly nascent
 in the day of the "Sweat-born" (the <em>early </em>Third
 Race). In its second half, when the "Sweat-born" gave
 birth to the "Egg-born," (the <em>middle </em>Third
 Race); and when these, instead of "hatching out" (may
 the reader pardon the rather ridiculous expression when applied
 to human beings in our age) as androgynous beings, began to evolve
 into separate males and females; and when the same law of evolution
 led them to reproduce their kind sexually, an act which forced
 the creative gods, compelled by Karmic law, to incarnate in <em>mindless
 </em>men; then only was speech developed. But even then it was
 still no better than a tentative effort. The whole human race
 was at that time of "one language and of one lip." This
 did not prevent the last two Sub-Races of the Third Race* from
 building cities, and sowing far and wide the first seeds of civilization
 under the guidance of their divine instructors,** and their own
 already awakened minds. Let the reader also bear in mind that,
 as each of the seven races is divided into four ages -- the Golden,
 Silver, Bronze, and Iron Age -- so is every smallest division
 of such races.*** Speech then developed, according to occult teaching,
 in the following order: --
 </p><p>
 I. Monosyllabic speech; that of the first approximately fully
 developed human beings at the close of the Third Root-race, the
 "golden-coloured," yellow-complexioned men, after their
 separation into sexes, and the full

 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * To avoid confusion, let the reader remember that the term Root-Race
 applies to one of the seven great Races, sub-Race to one of its
 great Branches, and Family-Race to one of the sub-divisions, which
 include nations and large tribes.

 "Instructors" is explained.

 <p>
 awakening of their minds. Before that, they communicated through
 what would now be called "thought-transference," though,
 with the exception of the Race called the "Sons of Will and
 Yoga" -- the first in whom the "Sons of Wisdom"
 had incarnated -- thought was but very little developed in nascent
 physical man, and never soared above a low terrestrial level.
 Their physical bodies belonging to the Earth, their Monads remained
 on a higher plane altogether. Language could not be well developed
 before the full acquisition and development of their reasoning
 faculties. This monosyllabic speech was the vowel parent, so to
 speak, of the monosyllabic languages mixed with hard consonants,
 still in use amongst the yellow races which are known to the anthropologist.*
 </p><p>
 <strong>II</strong>. These linguistic characteristics developed
 into the agglutinative languages. The latter were spoken by some
 Atlantean races, while other parent stocks of the Fourth Race
 preserved the mother-language. And as languages have their cyclic
 evolution, their childhood, purity, growth, <em>fall into matter,
 </em>admixture with other languages, maturity, decay and finally
 death,** so the primitive speech of the most civilized Atlantean
 races -- that language, which is referred to as "Rakshasi
 Bhasa," in old Sanskrit works -- decayed and almost died
 out. While the "cream" of the Fourth Race gravitated
 more and more toward the apex of physical and intellectual evolution,
 thus leaving as an heirloom to the nascent Fifth (the Aryan) Race
 the inflectional, highly developed languages, the agglutinative
 decayed and remained as a fragmentary fossil idiom, scattered
 now, and nearly limited to the aboriginal tribes of America.
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * The present yellow races are the descendants, however, of the
 early branches of the Fourth Race. Of the third, the only <em>pure
 and direct </em>descendants are, as said above, a portion of the
 fallen and degenerated Australians, whose far distant ancestors
 belonged to a division of the seventh Sub-race of the Third. The
 rest are of mixed Lemuro-Atlantean descent. They have since then
 entirely changed in stature and intellectual capacities.
 </p><p>
 **<em> Language </em>is certainly coeval with reason, and could
 never have been developed before men became one with the informing
 principles in them -- those who fructified and awoke to life the
 manasic element dormant in primitive man. For, as Professor Max
 Muller tells us in his "<em>Science of Thought,</em>"<em>
 </em>"Thought and language are identical." Yet to add
 to this the reflection that <em>thoughts which are</em> <em>too
 deep for words, do not really exist at all, </em>is rather risky,
 as thought impressed upon the astral tablets exists in eternity
 whether expressed or not. Logos is both reason and speech. But
 language, proceeding in cycles, is not always adequate to express
 <em>spiritual </em>thoughts. Moreover, in one sense, the Greek
 Logos is the equivalent of the Sanscrit Vach, "the immortal
 (intellectual) ray of spirit." And the fact that Vach (as
 Devasena, an <em>aspect </em>of Saraswati, the goddess of hidden
 Wisdom) is the spouse of the eternal celibate Kumara, unveils
 a suggestive, though veiled, reference to the <em>Kumaras, </em>those
 "who refused to create," but who were compelled later
 on to complete <em>divine</em> Man by incarnating in him. All
 this will be fully explained in the sections that follow.</p><hr>

 Sanskrit, very erroneously called "the elder sister"
 of the Greek, instead of its mother -- was the first language
 (now the mystery tongue of the Initiates, of the Fifth Race).
 At any rate, the "Semitic" languages are the bastard
 descendants of the first phonetic corruptions of the eldest children
 of the early Sanskrit. The occult doctrine admits of no such divisions
 as the Aryan and the Semite, accepting even the Turanian with
 ample reservations. The Semites, especially the Arabs, are later
 Aryans -- degenerate in spirituality and perfected in materiality.
 To these belong all the Jews and the Arabs. The former are a tribe
 descended from the Tchandalas of India, the outcasts, many of
 them ex-Brahmins, who sought refuge in Chaldea, in Scinde, and
 Aria (Iran), and were truly born from their father A-bram (No
 Brahmin) some 8,000 years <strong>B.C.</strong> The latter, the
 Arabs, are the descendants of those Aryans who would not go into
 India at the time of the dispersion of nations, some of whom remained
 on the borderlands thereof, in Afghanistan and Kabul,* and along
 the Oxus, while others penetrated into and invaded Arabia.

 But this was when Africa had already been raised as a continent.
 We have meanwhile to follow, as closely as limited space will
 permit, the gradual evolution of the now truly human species.
 It is in the suddenly arrested evolution of certain sub-races,
 and their forced and violent diversion into the purely animal
 line by artificial cross-breeding, truly analogous to the hybridization,
 which we have now learned to utilize in the vegetable and animal
 kingdoms, that we have to look for the origin of the anthropoids.

 * Ptolemy, speaking in his ninth table of the <em>Kabolitae </em>(Kabul
 tribes), calls them [[<em>Aristophuloi]], </em>the aristocratic
 or <em>noble tribes. </em>The Afghans call themselves <em>Ben-Issrael
 </em>(children of Is(<em>sa</em>)rael), from <em>Issa, </em>"woman
 and also earth," Sons of Mother Earth. But if you call an
 Afghan <em>Yahoudi</em> (<em>Jew</em>),<em> </em>he will kill
 you. The subject is fully treated elsewhere. The names of the
 supposed twelve tribes and the names of the real tribes, the same
 in number, of the Afghans, are the same. The Afghans being far
 older (at any rate, their Arabic stock) than the Israelites, no
 one need be surprised to find such tribal names among them as
 <em>Youssoufzic, </em>"Sons of Joseph" in Punjcaure
 and Boonere; the <em>Zablistanee </em>(Zebulon); Ben-manasseh
 (sons of Manasseh) among the Khojar Tartars; Isaguri, or Issachar
 (now Ashnagor in Afghanistan), etc., etc. The whole twelve names
 of the so-called twelve tribes are names of the signs of the Zodiac,
 as is now well proven. At any rate, the names of the oldest Arabic
 tribes, re-transliterated, yield the names of the zodiacal signs
 and of the mythical sons of Jacob likewise. Where are the traces
 of the Jewish twelve tribes? Nowhere. But there is a trace, and
 a good one, that the Jews have tried to deceive people with the
 help of those names. For, see what happens <em>ages after the
 ten tribes </em>had wholly disappeared from Babylon. Ptolemy Philadelphus,
 desiring to have the Hebrew Law translated for him into Greek
 (the famous <em>Septuagint</em>),<em> </em>wrote to the high priest
 of the Jews, Eleazar, to <em>send him six men from each of the
 twelve tribes</em>;<em> </em>and the <em>seventy-two representatives
 </em>(of whom sixty were ghosts apparently) came to the king in
 Egypt and translated the law amid miracles and wonders. See Butler's
 "<em>Horae Biblicae,</em>"<em> </em>Josephus, and Philo
 Judaeus. </p><hr>

 In these red-haired and hair-covered monsters, the fruit of the
 unnatural connection between men and animals, the "Lords
 of Wisdom" did not incarnate, as we see. Thus by a long series
 of transformations due to unnatural cross-breeding (unnatural
 "sexual selection"), originated in due course of time
 the lowest specimens of humanity; while further bestiality and
 the fruit of their first animal efforts of reproduction begat
 a species which developed into mammalian apes ages later.*

 As to the separation of sexes, it did not occur suddenly, as one
 may think. Nature proceeds slowly in whatever she does.

 This relates evidently to the so-called age of the amphibious
 reptiles, during which ages science maintains that <em>no man
 existed! </em>But what could the ancients know of antediluvian
 prehistoric animals and monsters! Nevertheless, in Book <strong>VI</strong>.
 of the Commentaries is found a passage which says, freely translated:
 --
 </p><p>
 "<em>When the Third separated and fell into sin by breeding
 men-animals, these </em>(the animals) <em>became ferocious, and
 men and they mutually destructive. Till then, there was no sin,
 no life taken. After </em>(the separation) <em>the Satya </em>(Yuga)
 <em>was at an end. The eternal spring became constant change and
 seasons succeeded. Cold forced men to build shelters and devise
 clothing. Then man appealed to the superior Fathers </em>(the
 higher gods or angels). <em>The Nirmanakaya of the Nagas, the
 wise Serpents and Dragons of Light came, and the precursors of
 the Enlightened </em>(Buddhas). <em>Divine Kings descended and
 taught men sciences and arts, for man could live no longer in
 the first land </em>(Adi-Varsha, the Eden of the first Races),
 <em>which had turned into a white frozen corpse.</em>"
 </p><p>
 The above is suggestive. We will see what can be inferred from
 this brief statement. Some may incline to think that there is
 more in it than is apparent at first sight.

 * The Commentary explains that the apes are the only species,
 among the animals, which has gradually and with every generation
 and variety tended more and more to return to the original type
 of its male forefather -- the dark gigantic Lemurian and Atlantean.
