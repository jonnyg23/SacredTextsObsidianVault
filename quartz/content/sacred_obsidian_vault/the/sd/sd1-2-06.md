 <h4>ยง VI.<br>
 THE MUNDANE EGG.</h4>
 
 <p>
 <strong>W</strong>HENCE this universal symbol? The Egg was incorporated
 as a sacred sign in the cosmogony of every people on the Earth,
 and was revered both on account of its form and its inner mystery.
 From the earliest mental conceptions of man, it was known as that
 which represented most successfully the origin and secret of being.
 The gradual development of the imperceptible germ within the closed
 shell; the inward working, without any apparent outward interference
 of force, which from a latent <em>nothing </em>produced an active
 <em>something</em>,<em> </em>needing nought save heat; and which,
 having gradually evolved into a concrete, living creature, broke
 its shell, appearing to the outward senses of all a self-generated,
 and self-created being -- must have been a standing miracle from
 the beginning.
 </p><p>
 The secret teaching explains the reason for this reverence by
 the Symbolism of the prehistoric races. The "First Cause"
 had no name in the beginnings. Later it was pictured in the fancy
 of the thinkers as an ever invisible, mysterious Bird that dropped
 an Egg into Chaos, which Egg becomes the Universe. Hence Brahm
 was called Kalahansa, "the swan in (Space and) Time."
 He became the "Swan of Eternity," who lays at the beginning
 of each Mahamanvantara a "Golden Egg." It typifies the
 great Circle, or O, itself a symbol for the universe and its spherical
 bodies.
 </p><p>
 The second reason for its having been chosen as the symbolical
 representation of the Universe, and of our earth, was its form.
 It was a Circle and a Sphere; and the ovi-form shape of our globe
 must have been known from the beginning of symbology, since it
 was so universally adopted. The first manifestation of the Kosmos
 in the form of an egg was the most widely diffused belief of antiquity.
 As Bryant shows (iii., 165), it was a symbol adopted among the
 Greeks, the Syrians, Persians, and Egyptians. In chap. liv. of
 the Egyptian Ritual, Seb, the god of Time and of the Earth, is
 spoken of as having laid an egg, or the Universe, "an egg
 conceived at the hour of the great one of the Dual Force"
 (Sec. V., 2, 3,<em> </em>etc.).
 </p><p>
 Ra is shown like Brahma gestating in the Egg of the Universe.
 The deceased is "resplendent in the Egg of the land of mysteries"
 (xxii., 1). For, this is "the Egg to which is given life
 among the gods" (xlii., 11). "It is the Egg of the great
 clucking Hen, the Egg of Seb, who issues from it like a hawk"
 (lxiv., 1, 2, 3; lxxvii., 1).
 </p><p>
 With the Greeks the Orphic Egg is described by Aristophanes, and
 was part of the Dionysiac and other mysteries, during which</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 360 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 the Mundane Egg was consecrated and its significance explained;
 Porphyry showing it a representation of the world, [[<em>Ermenenei
 de to oon kosmon</em>]]. Faber and Bryant have tried to show that
 the egg typified the ark of Noah, which, unless the latter is
 accepted as purely allegorical and symbolical, is a wild belief.
 It can have typified the ark only as a synonym of the moon, the
 <em>argha </em>which carries the universal seed of life; but had
 surely nothing to do with the ark of the Bible. Anyhow, the belief
 that the universe existed in the beginning in the shape of an
 egg was general. And as Wilson has it: "A similar account
 of the first aggregation of the elements in the form of an egg
 is given in all the (Indian) Puranas, with the usual epithet Haima
 or Hiranya, 'golden' as it occurs in Manu." Hiranya, however,
 means "resplendent," "shining," rather than
 "golden," as proven by the great Indian scholar, the
 late Swami Dayanand Sarasvati, in his unpublished polemics with
 Professor Max Muller. As said in the Vishnu Purana: "Intellect
 (Mahat) . . . the (unmanifested) gross elements inclusive, formed
 an egg . . . and the lord of the Universe himself abided in it,
 in the character of Brahma. In that egg, O Brahman, were the continents,
 and seas and mountains, the planets and divisions of the universe,
 the gods, the demons and mankind." (<em>Book</em> i.,<em>
 ch.</em> 2.)<em> </em>Both in Greece and in India the first visible
 male being, who united in himself the nature of either sex, abode
 in the egg and issued from it. This "first born of the world"
 was Dionysius, with some Greeks; the god who sprang from the mundane
 egg, and from whom the mortals and immortals were derived. The
 god Ra is shown in the <em>Ritual </em>(Book of the Dead, xvii.,
 50) beaming in his egg (the Sun), and he starts off as soon as
 the god <em>Shoo </em>(the Solar energy) awakens and gives him
 the impulse. "He is in the Solar egg, the egg to which is
 given life among the gods" (<em>Ibid.</em>,<em> </em>xlii.,<em>
 </em>13). The Solar god exclaims: "I am the creative soul
 of the celestial abyss. None sees my nest, none can break my egg,
 I am the Lord!" (<em>Ibid.</em>, LXXXV.).
 </p><p>
 In view of this circular form, the "|" issuing from
 the "<img src="sd1-4a.jpg" align="MIDDLE">," or the
 egg, or the male from the female in the androgyne, it is strange
 to find a scholar saying -- on the ground that the most ancient
 Indian <b>MSS</b>. show no trace of it -- that the ancient Aryans
 were ignorant of the decimal notation. The 10, being the sacred
 number of the universe, was secret and esoteric, both as the unit
 and cipher, or <em>zero</em>,<em> </em>the circle. Moreover, Professor
 Max Muller says that "the two words <em>cipher </em>and <em>zero</em>,<em>
 </em>which are but one, are sufficient to prove that our figures
 are borrowed from the Arabs.* Cipher is the Arabic "cifron,"
 and means

 <p>
 <em>empty</em>,<em> </em>a translation of the Sanscrit name of
 nought "sunya," he says.* The Arabs had their figures
 from Hindustan, and never claimed the discovery for themselves.**
 As to the Pythagoreans, we need but turn to the ancient manuscripts
 of Boethius's <em>Geometry</em>,<em> </em>composed in the sixth
 century, to find among the Pythagorean numerals*** the 1 and the
 <em>nought</em>,<em> </em>as the first and final ciphers. And
 Porphyry, who quotes from the Pythagorean <em>Moderatus</em>,<em>****
 </em>says that the numerals of Pythagoras were "hieroglyphical
 symbols, by means whereof he explained ideas concerning the nature
 of things," or the origin of the universe.
 </p><p>
 Now, if, on the other hand, the most ancient Indian manuscripts
 show as yet no trace of decimal notation in them, and Max Muller
 states very clearly that until now he has found but nine letters
 (the initials of the Sanscrit numerals) in them; on the other
 hand, we have records as ancient to supply the wanted proof. We
 speak of the sculptures and the sacred imagery in the most ancient
 temples of the far East. Pythagoras derived his knowledge from
 India; and we find Professor Max Muller corroborating this statement,
 at least so far as to allow the <em>Neo</em>-Pythagoreans to have
 been the first teachers of "ciphering," among the Greeks
 and Romans; that "they at Alexandria, or in Syria, became
 acquainted with the Indian figures, and adapted them to the Pythagorean
 abacus" (our figures). This cautious admission implies that
 Pythagoras himself was acquainted with but <em>nine</em> figures.
 Thus we might reasonably answer that, although we possess no certain
 proof (<em>exoterically</em>)<em> </em>that the decimal notation
 was known by Pythagoras, who lived on the very close of the archaic
 ages,***** we have yet sufficient evidence to show that the full
 numbers, as given by Boethius, were known to the Pythagoreans,
 even before Alexandria was built.****** This evidence we find
 in Aristotle, who says that "some philosophers hold that
 ideas and numbers are of the same nature, and amount to TEN in
 all."******* This, we believe, will be sufficient to show
 that the decimal notation was known among them at least as early
 as four centuries B.C., for Aristotle does not seem to treat the
 question as an innovation of the "Neo-Pythagoreans."

 * A Kabalist would be rather inclined to believe that as the Arabic
 <em>cifron </em>was taken from the Indian <em>Synya</em>, nought,
 so the Jewish Kabalistic Sephiroth (<em>Sephrim</em>) were taken
 from the word cipher, not in the sense of emptiness but the reverse
 -- that of creation by number and degrees in their evolution.
 And the Sephiroth are 10 or <img src="sd1-333.jpg" align="MIDDLE">.

 <p>
 But we know more than that: <em>we</em> <em>know </em>that the
 decimal system must have been known to the mankind of the earliest
 archaic ages, since the whole astronomical and geometrical portion
 of the secret sacerdotal language was built upon the number 10,
 or the combination of the male and female principles, and since
 the Pyramid of "Cheops" is built upon the measures of
 this decimal notation, or rather upon the digits and their combinations
 with the <em>nought. </em>Of this, however, sufficient was said
 in <em>Isis Unveiled</em>,<em> </em>and it is useless to repeat
 and return to the same subject.
 </p><p>
 The symbolism of the Lunar and Solar Deities is so inextricably
 mixed up, that it is next to impossible to separate such glyphs
 as the egg, the lotus, and the "sacred" animals from
 each other. The <em>ibis</em>,<em> </em>for instance, sacred to
 Isis, who is often represented with the head of that bird, sacred
 also to Mercury or Thoth, because that god assumed its form while
 escaping from Typhon, -- the <em>ibis </em>was held in the greatest
 veneration in Egypt. There were two kinds of ibises, Herodotus
 tells us (Lib. II. c. 75 <em>et seq.</em>)<em> </em>in that country:
 one <em>quite black</em>,<em> </em>the other black and white.
 The former is credited with fighting and exterminating the winged
 serpents which came every spring from Arabia and infested the
 country. The other was sacred to the moon, because the latter
 planet is white and brilliant on her external side, dark and black
 on that side which she never turns to the earth. Moreover, the
 <em>ibis </em>kills land serpents, and makes the most terrible
 havoc amongst the eggs of the crocodile, and thus saves Egypt
 from having the Nile infested by those horrible Saurians. The
 bird is credited with doing so in the moonlight, and thus being
 helped by <em>Isis</em>,<em> </em>as the moon, her sidereal symbol.
 But the nearer esoteric truth underlying these popular myths is,
 that Hermes, as shown by Abenephius (<em>De cultu Egypt.</em>),<em>
 </em>watched under the form of that bird over the Egyptians, and
 taught them the occult arts and sciences. This means simply that
 the <em>ibis religiosa </em>had and has "magical" properties
 in common with many other birds, the albatross pre-eminently,
 and the mythical white swan, the swan of Eternity or Time, the
 <strong>K</strong>ALAHANSA.
 </p><p>
 Were it otherwise, indeed, why should all the ancient peoples,
 who were no more fools than we are, have had such a superstitious
 dread of killing certain birds? In Egypt, he who killed an <em>ibis</em>,<em>
 </em>or the golden hawk -- the symbol of the Sun and Osiris --
 risked and could hardly escape death. The veneration of some nations
 for birds was such that Zoroaster, in his precepts, forbids their
 slaughter as a heinous crime. We laugh in our age at every kind
 of divination. Yet why should so many generations have believed
 in divination by birds, and even in zoomancy, said by Suidas to
 have been imparted by Orpheus, who taught how to perceive in the
 yoke and white of</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 363 EGG-BORN LOGOI.</h6>
 
 <p>
 the egg, under certain conditions, that which the bird born from
 it would have seen around it during its short life. This occult
 art, which demanded 3,000 years ago the greatest learning and
 the most abstruse mathematical calculations, has now fallen into
 the depths of degradation: it is old cooks and fortune-tellers
 who read their future to servant-girls in search of husbands,
 by means of the white of an egg in a glass.
 </p><p>
 Nevertheless, even Christians have to this day their sacred birds;
 for instance, the dove, the symbol of the Holy Ghost. Nor have
 they neglected the sacred animals. The<em> Evangelical </em>zoolatry
 -- the Bull, the Eagle, the Lion, and the Angel (in reality the
 Cherub, or Seraph, the fiery-winged Serpent), is as much pagan
 as that of the Egyptians or the Chaldeans. These four animals
 are, in reality, the symbols of the four elements, and of the
 four <em>lower</em> principles in man. Nevertheless, they correspond
 physically and materially to the four constellations that form,
 so to speak, the <em>suite </em>or<em> cortege </em>of the Solar
 God, and occupy during the winter solstice the four cardinal points
 of the zodiacal circle. These four "animals" may be
 seen in many of the Roman Catholic New Testaments where the <em>portraits
 </em>of the evangelists are given. They are the animals of Ezekiel's
 Mercabah.
 </p><p>
 As truly stated by Ragon, "the ancient Hierophants have combined
 so cleverly the dogmas and symbols of their religious philosophies,
 that these symbols can be fully explained only by the combination
 and knowledge of <em>all </em>the keys." They can be only
 <em>approximately </em>interpreted, even if one finds out three
 out of these seven systems: the <em>anthropological</em>,<em>
 </em>the<em> psychic</em>,<em> </em>and the <em>astronomical.
 </em>The two chief interpretations, the highest and the lowest,
 the spiritual and the physiological, they preserved in the greatest
 secrecy until the latter fell into the dominion of the profane.
 Thus far, with regard only to the <em>pre-historic </em>Hierophants,
 with whom that which has now become purely (or impurely) phallic,
 was a science as profound and as mysterious as biology and physiology
 are now. This was their exclusive property, the fruit of their
 studies and discoveries. The other two were those which dealt
 with the creative gods (theogony), and with creative man, <em>i.e.</em>,
 the ideal and the practical mysteries. These interpretations were
 so cleverly veiled and combined, that many were those who, while
 arriving at the discovery of one meaning, were baffled in understanding
 the significance of the others, and could never unriddle them
 sufficiently to commit dangerous indiscretions. The highest, the
 first and the fourth -- theogony in relation to anthropogony --
 were almost impossible to fathom. We find the proofs of this in
 the Jewish "Holy Writ."
 </p><p>
 It is owing to the serpent being oviparous, that it became a symbol
 of wisdom and an emblem of the Logoi, or the <em>self-born. </em>In
 the temple of Philoe in Upper Egypt, an egg was artificially prepared
 of clay made of</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 364 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 various incenses, and it was made to hatch by a peculiar process,
 when a <em>cerastes </em>(the horned viper) was born. The same
 was done in antiquity for the cobra in the Indian temples. The
 <em>creative </em>God emerges from the egg that issues from the
 mouth of Kneph -- as a winged serpent -- because the Serpent is
 the symbol of the All-wisdom. With the Hebrews he is glyphed by
 the "flying or fiery serpents" of the Wilderness and
 Moses, and with the Alexandrian mystics he becomes the Ophio-Christos,
 the Logos of the Gnostics. The Protestants try to show that the
 allegory of the Brazen Serpent and of the "fiery serpents"
 has a direct reference to the mystery of Christ and Crucifixion*;
 but it has a far nearer relation, in truth, <em>to the mystery
 of generation</em>,<em> </em>when dissociated from the egg with
 the central germ, or the <em>circle with its central point. </em>The<em>
 brazen Serpent </em>had no such holy meaning as that; nor was
 it, in fact, glorified above the "<em>fiery serpents</em>"<em>
 for the bite of which it was only a natural remedy. </em>The symbological
 meaning of the word "brazen" being the feminine principle,
 and that of fiery, or "gold," the male one.**
 </p><p>
 In the <em>Book of the Dead</em>,<em> </em>as just shown, reference
 is often made to the Egg. Ra, the mighty one, remains in his Egg,
 during the struggle between the "children of the rebellion"
 and <em>Shoo </em>(the Solar Energy and the Dragon of Darkness)
 (ch. xvii.). The deceased is resplendent in his

 <p>
 * And this <em>only</em> because the brazen serpent was lifted
 on a pole! It had rather a reference to Mico the Egyptian egg
 standing upright supported by the sacred Tau; since the Egg and
 the Serpent are inseparable in the old worship and symbology of
 Egypt, and since both the Brazen and "fiery" serpents
 were <em>Saraphs</em>,<em> </em>the "burning fiery"
 messengers, or the serpent Gods, the <em>nagas </em>of India.
 It was a purely phallic symbol without the egg, while when associated
 with it -- it related to cosmic creation.
 </p><p>
 ** "Brass was a metal symbolizing the <em>nether world </em>.
 . . . that of the womb where life should be given . . . The word
 for serpent was in Hebrew <em>Nakash</em>,<em> </em>but this is
 the same term for <em>brass.</em>"<em> </em>It is said in
 Numbers (xxi.) that the Jews complained of the Wilderness <em>where
 there was no water </em>(<em>v</em>. 5); after which "the
 Lord sent fiery serpents" to bite them, when, to oblige Moses,
 he gives him as a remedy the <em>brazen serpent </em>on a pole
 to look at; after which "any man when he beheld the serpent
 of brass . . . . <em>lived</em>"<em> </em>(?). After that
 the "Lord," gathering the people together at the well
 of Beer, gives them water, (14-16), and grateful Israel sang this
 song, "Spring up, O Well," (<em>v</em>. 17). When, after
 studying symbology, the Christian reader comes to understand the
 innermost meaning of these three symbols -- <em>water</em>,<em>
 brazen</em>,<em> the serpent</em>,<em> </em>and a few more --
 <em>in the sense given to them in the Holy Bible</em>,<em> </em>he
 will hardly like to connect the sacred name of his Saviour with
 the "Brazen Serpent" incident. The Seraphim <img src="sd1-364a.gif" align="MIDDLE">
 (fiery winged serpents) are no doubt connected with, and inseparable
 from, the idea "of the serpent of eternity -- God,"
 as explained in Kenealy's Apocalypse. But the word cherub also
 meant serpent, in one sense, though its direct meaning is different;
 because the <em>Cherubim </em>and the Persian winged [[<em>gruphes</em>]]<em>
 </em>"griffins" -- the guardians of the golden mountain
 -- are the same, and their compound name shows their character,
 as it is formed of <img src="sd1-364b.gif" align="MIDDLE"> (kr)
 <em>circle</em>,<em> </em>and <img src="sd1-364c.gif" align="MIDDLE">
 "aub," or ob -- serpent -- therefore, a "serpent
 in a circle." And this settles the phallic character of the
 Brazen Serpent, and justifies Hezekiah for breaking it. (<em>See
 II. Kings</em>,<em> </em>18, 4). <em>Verbum sat. sapienti.</em>

 <p>
 Egg when he crosses to the land of mystery (xxii. i.). He is the
 Egg of Seb (liv. 1-3). . . . The Egg was the symbol of life in
 <em>immortality </em>and eternity; as also the glyph of the generative
 matrix; and the <em>tau</em>,<em> </em>associated with it, only
 of life and birth in <em>generation. </em>The<em> </em>Mundane
 Egg was placed in <em>Khnoom</em>,<em> </em>the "Water of
 Space," or the feminine <em>abstract </em>principle (Khnoom
 becoming, with the <em>fall </em>of mankind into generation and
 phallicism, Ammon, the <em>creative </em>God); and when <em>Phtah</em>,<em>
 </em>the "fiery god," carries the Mundane egg in his
 hand, then the symbolism becomes quite terrestrial and concrete
 in its significance. In conjunction with the hawk, the symbol
 of Osiris-Sun, the symbol is dual: it relates to both lives --
 the mortal and the immortal. In Kircher's <em>OEdipus Egyptiacus
 </em>(vol. iii., p. 124) one can see, on the papyrus engraved
 in it, an egg floating above the mummy. This is the symbol of
 hope and the promise of a <em>second birth </em>for the <em>Osirified
 </em>dead; his Soul, after due purification in the Amenti, will
 gestate in this egg of immortality, to be reborn from it into
 a new life on earth. For this Egg, in the esoteric Doctrine, is
 the <em>Devachan</em>,<em> </em>the abode of Bliss; the winged
 scarabeus being alike a symbol of it. The "winged globe"
 is but another form of the egg, and has the same significance
 as the scarabeus, the <em>Khopiroo </em>(from the root <em>Khoproo
 </em>"to become," "to be reborn,") which relates
 to the rebirth of man, as well as to his spiritual regeneration.
 </p><p>
 In the Theogony of Mochus, we find AEther first, and then the
 air, from which Ulom, the <em>intelligible </em>([[<em>noetos</em>]])
 deity (the visible Universe of Matter) is born out of the Mundane
 Egg. (Mover's <em>Phoinizer</em>,<em> </em>p. 282.)
 </p><p>
 In the <em>Orphic </em>Hymns, the Eros-Phanes evolves from the
 divine Egg, which the <em>AEthereal Winds </em>impregnate, wind
 being "the Spirit of the unknown Darkness" -- "the
 spirit of God" (as explains K. O. Muller, 236); the divine
 "Idea," says Plato, "who is said to move AEther."
 </p><p>
 In the Hindu <em>Katakopanishad</em>,<em> </em>Purusha, the divine
 spirit, already stands before the original matter, "from
 whose union springs the great soul of the world," Maha-Atma,
 Brahma, the Spirit of Life,* etc., etc.** Besides this there are
 many charming allegories on this subject scattered through the
 sacred books of the Brahmins. In one place it is the female creator
 who is first a germ, then a drop of heavenly dew, a pearl, and
 then an egg. In such cases -- of which there are too many to enumerate
 them separately -- the Egg gives birth to the four elements within
 the fifth, Ether, and is covered with seven coverings, which become
 later on the seven upper and the seven lower worlds. Breaking
 in two, the shell becomes the heaven, and the meat in the egg
 the earth, the white forming the terres-

 trial waters. Then again, it is Vishnu who emerges from within
 the egg with a lotus in his hand. Vinata, a daughter of Daksha
 and wife of Kasyapa ("the Self-born sprung from Time,"
 one of the seven "creators" of our world), brought forth
 an egg from which was born Garuda, the vehicle of Vishnu, the
 latter allegory having a relation to our Earth only, as Garuda
 is the Great Cycle.
 </p><p>
 The egg was sacred to Isis; the priests of Egypt never ate eggs
 on that account.*
 </p><p>
 Diodorus Siculus states that Osiris was born from an Egg, like
 Brahma. From Leda's Egg Apollo and Latona were born, as also Castor
 and Pollux -- the bright Gemini. And though the Buddhists do not
 attribute the same origin to their Founder, yet, no more than
 the ancient Egyptians or the modern Brahmins, do they eat eggs,
 lest they should destroy the germ of life latent in them, and
 commit thereby Sin. The Chinese believe that their first man was
 born from an egg, which <em>Tien</em>,<em> </em>a god, dropped
 down from heaven to earth into the waters.** This symbol is still
 regarded by some as representing the idea of the origin of life,
 which is a scientific truth, though the human <em>ovum </em>is
 invisible to the naked eye. Therefore we see respect shown to
 it from the remotest past, by the Greeks, Phoenicians, Romans,
 the Japanese, and the Siamese, the North and South American tribes,
 and even the savages of the remotest islands.
 </p><p>
 With the Egyptians, the concealed god was Ammon (<em>Mon</em>).
 All their gods were dual: the scientific <em>reality </em>for
 the Sanctuary; its double, the fabulous and mythical Entity, for
 the masses. For instance, as observed in "Chaos, Theos, Kosmos,"
 the older Horus was the <em>Idea </em>of the world remaining in
 the demiurgic mind "born in Darkness before the creation
 of the world;" the <em>second </em>Horus*** was the same
 <em>Idea </em>going forth from the <em>Logos</em>,<em> </em>becoming
 clothed with matter and assuming an actual existence. (Compare
 <em>Mover</em>'<em>s </em>"<em>Phoinizer</em>,"<em>
 p. </em>268.) The same with <em>Khnoum </em>and Ammon;**** both
 are represented ram-headed, and both often confused, though their
 functions are different. Khnoum is "the modeller of men,"
 fashioning men and things out of the Mundane Egg on a potter's
 wheel;

 <p>
 * Isis is almost always represented holding a lotus in one hand
 and in the other a circle and the Cross (<em>crux ansata</em>),<em>
 </em>the Egg being sacred to her.

 ** The Chinese seem to have thus anticipated Sir William Thomson's
 theory that the first living germ had dropped to the Earth from
 some passing comet. Query! why should this be called<em> scientific
 </em>and the Chinese idea a superstitious, foolish theory?
 </p><p>
 *** Horus -- the "older," or <em>Haroiri</em>,<em> </em>is
 an ancient aspect of the solar god, contemporary with <em>Ra</em>
 and<em> Shoo; </em>Haroiri is often mistaken for Hor (Horsusi),
 Son of Osiris and Isis. The Egyptians very often represented the
 rising Sun under the form of Hor the older, rising from a full-blown
 lotus, the Universe, when the solar disc is always found on the
 hawk-head of that god. Haroiri is Khnoum.

 Supreme Spirit.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 1, Page]] 367 THE SCANDINAVIAN LOGOS.</h6>
 
 <p>
 Ammon-Ra, the generator, is the secondary aspect of the concealed
 deity. Khnoum was adored at Elephanta and Philoe,* Ammon at Thebes.
 But it is Emepht, the One, Supreme <em>Planetary </em>principle,
 who blows the egg out of his mouth, and who is, therefore, Brahma.
 The shadow of the deity, Kosmic and universal, of that which broods
 over and permeates the egg with its vivifying Spirit until the
 germ contained in it is ripe, was the <em>mystery </em>god whose
 name was unpronounceable. It is Phtah, however, "he who opens,"
 the opener of life and Death,** who proceeds from the egg of the
 world to begin his dual work. (<em>Book of Numbers.</em>)
 </p><p>
 According to the Greeks, the phantom form of the Chemis (<em>Chemi</em>,<em>
 </em>ancient Egypt) which floats on the ethereal waves of the
 Empyrean Sphere, was called into being by Horus-Apollo, the Sun
 god, who caused it to evolve out of the Mundane egg.***
 </p><p>
 In the Scandinavian Cosmogony -- placed by Professor Max Muller,
 in point of time, as "far anterior to the Vedas" in
 the poem of Voluspa (the song of the prophetess), the Mundane
 egg is again discovered in the phantom-germ of the Universe, which
 is represented as lying in the <em>Ginnungagap</em> --<em> </em>the
 cup of illusion (<em>Maya</em>)<em> </em>the boundless and void
 abyss. In this world's matrix, formerly a region of night and
 desolation, <em>Nebelheim </em>(the mist-place, the <em>nebular
 </em>as it is called now, in the astral light) dropped a <em>ray
 of cold light </em>which overflowed this cup and froze in it.
 Then the <em>Invisible </em>blew a scorching wind which dissolved
 the frozen waters and cleared the mist. These waters (chaos),
 called the streams of<em> Elivagar</em>,<em> </em>distilling in
 vivifying drops, fell down and created the earth and the giant
 <em>Ymir</em>,<em> </em>who only had "the semblance of man"
 (the Heavenly man), and the cow, <em>Audhumla </em>(the "mother"
 or astral light, Cosmic Soul) from whose udder flowed <em>four
 </em>streams of milk (the four cardinal points: the four heads
 of the four rivers of Eden, etc., etc.) and which "four"
 allegorically are symbolized by the <em>cube </em>in all its various
 and mystical meanings.
 </p><p>
 The Christians -- especially the Greek and Latin Churches -- have
 fully adopted the symbol, and see in it a commemoration of life

 fear, to the red Easter Egg of the Slavonian peasant, a cycle
 has passed. And yet, whether in civilized Europe, or among the
 abject savages of Central America, we find the same archaic, primitive
 thought; if we only search for it and do not disfigure -- in the
 haughtiness of our fancied mental and physical superiority --
 the original idea of the symbol.
