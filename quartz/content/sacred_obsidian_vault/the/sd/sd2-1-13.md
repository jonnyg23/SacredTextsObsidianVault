 (<em>a</em>) To understand this verse 38, it must be read together
 with the three verses of Stanza <b>IX</b>. Up to this point of
 evolution man belongs more to metaphysical than physical nature.
 It is only after the so-called <strong>F</strong>ALL<em>,</em>
 that the races began to develop rapidly into a purely human shape.
 And, in order that he may correctly comprehend the full meaning
 of the Fall, so mystic and transcendental is it in its real significance,
 the student must be told at once the details which preceded

 * Strictly speaking, it is only from the time of the Atlantean,
 brown and yellow giant Races, that one ought to speak of MAN,
 since it was the Fourth race only which was the first <em>completely
 human species, </em>however much larger in size than we are now.
 In "Man" (by two chelas), all that is said of the Atlanteans
 is quite correct. It is chiefly that race which became "black
 with sin" that brought the divine names of the Asuras, the
 Rakshasas and the Daityas into disrepute, and passed them on to
 posterity as the names of fiends. For, as said, the Suras (gods)
 or Devas having incarnated in the wise men of Atlantis, the names
 of <em>Asuras and Rakshasas </em>were given to the Atlanteans;
 which names, owing to their incessant conflicts with the last
 remnants of the Third Race and the "Sons of Will and Yoga,"
 have led to the later allegories about them in the Puranas. "Asura
 was the generic appellation of all the Atlanteans who were the
 enemies of the spiritual heroes of the Aryans (gods)." ("Man,"
 p. 97.)</p><hr>

 <p>
 this event; of which event modern theology has formed a pivot
 on which its most pernicious and absurd dogmas and beliefs are
 made to turn.
 </p><p>
 The archaic commentaries explain, as the reader must remember,
 that, of the Host of Dhyanis, whose turn it was to incarnate as
 the <em>Egos</em> of the immortal, but, <em>on this plane,</em>
 <em>senseless </em>monads -- that some "obeyed" (the
 law of evolution) immediately when the men of the Third Race became
 physiologically and physically ready, <em>i.e</em>., when they
 had separated into sexes. These were those early conscious Beings
 who, now adding conscious knowledge and will to their inherent
 Divine purity, <em>created </em>by<em> Kriyasakti </em>the semi-Divine
 man, who became the seed on earth for future adepts. Those, on
 the other hand, who, jealous of their intellectual freedom (unfettered
 as it then was by the bonds of matter), said: -- "We can
 choose . . . we have wisdom" (See verse 24), and incarnated
 far later -- these had their first Karmic punishment prepared
 for them. They got bodies (physiologically) inferior to their
 astral models, because their <em>chhayas </em>had belonged to
 progenitors of an inferior degree in the seven classes. As to
 those "Sons of Wisdom" who had "deferred"
 their incarnation till the Fourth Race, which was already tainted
 (physiologically) with sin and impurity, they produced a terrible
 cause, the Karmic result of which weighs on them to this day.
 It was produced in themselves, and they became the carriers of
 that seed of iniquity for aeons to come, because the bodies they
 had to inform had become defiled through their own procrastination.
 (<em>See verses 32, </em>36.)
 </p><p>
 This was the "Fall of the angels," because of their
 rebellion against Karmic Law. The "fall of <em>man</em>"<em>
 </em>was no fall, <em>for he was irresponsible. </em>But "Creation"
 having been invented on the dualistic system as the "prerogative
 of God alone," the legitimate <em>attribute </em>patented
 by theology in the name of an <em>infinite </em>deity of their
 own making, this power had to be regarded as "Satanic,"
 and as an usurpation of divine rights. Thus, the foregoing, in
 the light of such narrow views, must naturally be considered as
 a terrible slander on man, "created in the image of God,"
 a still more dreadful blasphemy in the face of the dead-letter
 dogma. "Your doctrine," the Occultists were already
 told, "makes of man, created out of dust in the likeness
 of his God, a vehicle of the Devil, from the first." "Why
 did you make of your god a devil -- both, moreover, created <em>in
 your own image?</em>"<em> </em>is our reply. The <em>esoteric
 </em>interpretation of the Bible, however, sufficiently refutes
 this slanderous invention of theology; the Secret Doctrine must
 some day become the just Karma of the Churches -- more anti-Christian
 than the representative assemblies of the most confirmed Materialists
 and Atheists.
 </p><p>
 The old doctrine about the true meaning of the "Fallen Angels,"
 in its anthropological and evolutionary sense, is contained in
 the Kabala,</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 229 THE MYSTERIES AMONG THE MAYAS.</h6>
 
 <p>
 and explains the Bible. It is found pre-eminent in <em>Genesis
 </em>when the latter is read in a spirit of research for truth,
 with no eye to dogma, and in no mood of preconception. This is
 easily proven. In <em>Genesis </em>(vi.) the "Sons of God"
 --<em> B</em>'<em>ne Aleim</em> -- become enamoured of the daughters
 of men, marry, and reveal to their wives the mysteries unlawfully
 learnt by them in heaven, according to Enoch; and this is the
 "Fall of Angels."* But what is, in reality, the "Book
 of Enoch" itself, from which the author of <em>Revelation
 </em>and even the St. John of the Fourth Gospel have so profusely
 quoted? (<em>e.g.</em>, verse 8, in chapter 10, about all who
 have come before Jesus, being "thieves and robbers.")
 Simply a <em>Book of Initiation, </em>giving out in allegory and
 cautious phraseology the programme of certain archaic mysteries
 performed in the <em>inner </em>temples. The author of the "Sacred
 Mysteries among the Mayas and Quiches" very justly suggests
 that the so-called "Visions" of Enoch relate to his
 (Enoch's) experience at initiation, and what he learned in the
 mysteries; while he very erroneously states his opinion that Enoch
 had learned them before being converted
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------

 <p>
 * In general, the so-called <em>orthodox </em>Christian conceptions
 about the "fallen" angels or Satan, are as remarkable
 as they are absurd. About a dozen could be cited, of the most
 various character as to details, and all from the pen of educated
 lay authors, "University graduates" of the present quarter
 of our century. Thus, the author of "Earth's Earliest Ages,"
 J. H. Pember, <b>M.A</b>., devotes a thick volume to proving Theosophists,
 Spiritualists, Metaphysicians, Agnostics, Mystics, poets, and
 every contemporary author on oriental speculations, to be the
 devoted servants of the "Prince of the Air," and irretrievably
 damned. He describes Satan and his Antichrist in this wise: --
 </p><p>
 "Satan is the 'Anointed Cherub' of old. . . . God created
 Satan, the fairest and wisest of all his creatures in this part
 of His Universe, and made him Prince of the World, and of the
 Power of the Air. . . . He was placed in an Eden, which was both
 far anterior to the Eden of Genesis. . . . and of an altogether
 different and more substantial character, resembling the New Jerusalem.
 Thus, Satan being perfect in wisdom, and beauty, His vast empire
 is our earth, if not the whole solar system. . . . Certainly no
 other angelic power of greater or even equal dignity has been
 revealed to us. The <em>Archangel Michael himself is quoted by
 Jude as preserving towards the Prince of Darkness the respect
 due to a superior, however wicked he may be, until God has formally
 commanded </em>his deposition." Then we are informed that
 "Satan was from the moment of his creation <em>surrounded
 by the insignia of royalty</em>" (!<em> </em>!): that he
 "awoke to consciousness to find the air filled with the rejoicing
 music of those whom God had appointed . . . ." Then the Devil
 "<em>passes from the royalty to his priestly dignity</em>"
 (! ! !) "Satan <em>was also a priest of the Most High,</em>"<em>
 </em>etc., etc. And now -- "Antichrist will be Satan incarnate"
 (pp. 56-59). The Pioneers of the coming Apollyon have already
 appeared -- they are the Theosophists, the Occultists, the authors
 of the "Perfect Way," of "Isis Unveiled,"
 of the "Mystery of the Ages," and even of the "<strong>L</strong>ight
 of <strong>A</strong>sia"! ! The author notes the "<em>avowed
 origin</em>"<em> </em>(of Theosophy) <em>from the </em>"<em>descending
 angels,</em>"<em> </em>from the "Nephilim," or
 the angels of the <b>VI</b>th ch. of <em>Genesis, </em>and the
 Giants. He ought to note his own descent from them also, as the
 present Secret Doctrine endeavours to show -- unless he refuses
 to belong to the present humanity. </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 230 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 to Christianity (!!); furthermore, he believes that this book
 was written "at the beginning of the Christian era, when
 . . . the customs and religion of the Egyptians fell into decadency"!
 This is hardly possible, since Jude quotes in his epistle from
 the "Book of Enoch" (verse 14); and, therefore, as Archbishop
 Laurence, the translator of the Book of Enoch from the Ethiopic
 version, remarks, it "could not have been the production
 of a writer who lived after . . . or was even coeval with"
 the writers of the New Testament: unless, indeed, Jude and the
 Gospels, and all that follows, was also a production of the already
 established Church -- which, some critics say, is not impossible.
 But we are now concerned with the "fallen Angels" of
 Enoch, rather than with Enoch himself.
 </p><p>
 In Indian exotericism, these angels (<em>Asuras</em>)<em> </em>are
 also denounced as "the enemies of the gods;" those who
 oppose sacrificial worship offered to the latter. In Christian
 theology they are broadly referred to as the "Fallen Spirits,"
 the heroes of various conflicting and contradictory legends about
 them, gathered from Pagan sources. The <em>coluber tortuosus </em>"the
 tortuous snake," a qualification said to have originated
 with the Jews, had quite another meaning before the Roman Church
 distorted it: -- among others, <em>a purely astronomical meaning.</em>
 
 </p><p>
 The "Serpent" fallen from on high, "<em>deorsum
 fluens,</em>"<em> </em>was credited with the possession of
 the Keys of the Empire of the Dead, [[<em>tou thanatus arche</em>]]
 to that day, when Jesus saw it "falling like lightning from
 heaven" (<em>Luke </em>x. 17, 18), the Roman Catholic interpretation
 of <em>cadebat ut fulgur </em>to the contrary, notwithstanding;
 and it means indeed that even "the devils are subject"
 to the <em>Logos -- who </em>is <strong>W</strong>ISDOM, but who,
 as the opponent of ignorance, is Satan or Lucifer at the same
 time. This remark refers to divine Wisdom falling like lightning
 on, and quickening the intellects of those who fight the devils
 of ignorance and superstition. Up to the time when Wisdom, in
 the shape of the incarnating Spirits of <strong>M</strong>AHAT,
 descended from on high to animate and call the Third Race to real
 conscious life, humanity -- if it can be so called in its animal,
 senseless state --was of course doomed to -<em>- moral </em>as
 well as to physical death. The Angels <em>fallen into generation
 </em>are referred to metaphorically <em>as Serpents and Dragons
 of Wisdom. </em>On the other hand, regarded in the light of the
 <b>L</b>OGOS, the Christian Saviour, like Krishna, whether as
 man or logos, may be said to have saved those who believed in
 the secret teachings from "eternal death," to have conquered
 the Kingdom of Darkness, or Hell, as every Initiate does. This
 in the human, terrestrial form of the Initiates, and also because
 the <em>logos </em>is Christos, that principle of our inner nature
 which develops in us into the Spiritual Ego -- the Higher-Self
 -- being formed of the indissoluble union <em>of Buddhi </em>(the
 sixth) and the spiritual efflorescence of <em>Manas, the </em>
 </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 231 SATANIC MYTHS.</h6>
 
 <p>
 fifth principle.* "The Logos is passive Wisdom in Heaven
 and Conscious, Self-Active Wisdom on Earth," we are taught.
 It is the Marriage of "Heavenly man" with the "Virgin
 of the World" --Nature, as described in <em>Pymander</em>;<em>
 </em>the result of which is their progeny -- immortal man. It
 is this which is called in St. John's Revelation the marriage
 of the lamb with his bride. (xix. 7.) That "wife" is
 now identified with the Church of Rome owing to the arbitrary
 interpretations of her votaries. But they seem to forget that
 her <em>linen </em>may be fine and white <em>outwardly </em>(like
 the "whitened sepulchre"), but that the rottenness she
 is inwardly filled with, is not "the righteousness of Saints"
 (<em>v</em>. 8. <em>ibid</em>)<em>, </em>but rather the blood
 of the Saints she has "slain upon the earth" (<em>chap</em>.
 xviii. 24.) Thus the remark made by the great Initiate (<em>in
 Luke </em>x. 18) -- one that referred allegorically to the ray
 of Enlightenment and reason, <em>falling like lightning </em>from
 on high into the hearts and <em>minds </em>of the converts to
 that old wisdom-religion then presented in a new form by the wise
 Galilean Adeptt** -- was distorted out of recognition (as was
 his own personality), and made to fit in with one of the most
 cruel as the most pernicious of all theological dogmas. (<em>Vide
 at the end of Stanza XI. </em>"<strong>S</strong>ATANIC <strong>M</strong>YTHS.")
 </p><p>
 But if Western theology alone holds the patent for, and copyright
 of<strong> S</strong>ATAN -- in all the dogmatic horror of that
 fiction -- other nationalities
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * It is not correct to refer to Christ -- as some theosophists
 do -- as the sixth principle in man -- <em>Buddhi. </em>The latter
 <em>per se </em>is a passive and latent principle, the spiritual
 vehicle of Atman, inseparable from the manifested Universal Soul.
 It is only in union and in conjunction with <em>Self-consciousness
 </em>that<em> Buddhi</em> becomes the Higher Self and the divine,
 discriminating Soul. <em>Christos </em>is the seventh principle,
 if anything.
 </p><p>
 ** To make it plainer, any one who reads that passage in <em>Luke,
 </em>will see that the remark follows the report of the <em>seventy,
 </em>who rejoice that "even the devils (the spirit of controversy
 and reasoning, or the opposing power, since Satan means simply
 "<em>adversary</em>"<em> </em>or <em>opponent</em>)<em>
 </em>are subject unto us through thy name." (<em>Luke</em>
 x. 17.) Now, "thy name" means the name of Christos,
 or Logos, or the spirit of true divine wisdom, as distinct from
 the spirit of intellectual or mere materialistic reasoning --
 the HIGHER SELF in short. And when Jesus remarks to this that
 he has "beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven,"
 it is a mere statement of his clairvoyant powers, notifying them
 that he already knew it, and a reference to the incarnation of
 the divine ray (the gods or angels) which <em>falls into generation.
 </em>For not all men, by any means, benefit by that incarnation,
 and with some the power remains latent and dead during the whole
 life. Truly "No man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father;
 and who the Father is, but the Son" as added by Jesus then
 and there (<em>Ibid</em> v. 22)<em> </em>-- the Church "of
 Christ" less than any one else. The Initiates alone understood
 the secret meaning of the term "Father and the Son,"
 and knew that it referred to Spirit and Soul on the Earth. For
 the teachings of Christ were <em>occult </em>teachings, which
 could only be explained <em>at the initiation. </em>They were
 never intended for the masses, for Jesus forbade the twelve to
 go to the Gentiles and the Samaritans (<em>Matt</em>. x. 8), and
 repeated to his disciples that the "mysteries of Heaven"
 were for them alone, not for the multitudes (<em>Mark </em>iv.
 11). </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 232 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 and religions have committed equal errors in their misinterpretation
 of this tenet, which is one of the most profoundly philosophical
 and ideal conceptions of ancient thought. For they have both disfigured
 and hinted at the correct meaning of it in their numerous allegories
 touching the subject. Nor have the
 </p><p>
 semi-esoteric dogmas of Puranic Hinduism failed to evolve very
 suggestive symbols and allegories concerning the rebellious and
 fallen gods. The Puranas teem with them; and we find a direct
 hint at the truth in the frequent allusions of Parasara (<em>Vishnu
 Purana</em>),<em> </em>to all those Rudras, Rishis, Asuras, Kumaras
 and Munis, having <em>to be born in every age, </em>to re-incarnate
 in every Manvantara. This (esoterically) is equivalent to saying
 that the FLAMES born of the Universal Mind (Mahat), owing to the
 mysterious workings of Karmic Will and an impulse of Evolutionary
 Law, had, as in Pymander -- without any gradual transition --
 landed on this Earth, having <em>broken through the seven Circles
 of fire, </em>or the seven intermediate Worlds, in short.
 </p><p>
 There is an eternal cyclic law of re-births, and the series is
 headed at every new Manvantaric dawn by those who had enjoyed
 their rest from re-incarnations in previous Kalpas for incalculable
 <em>AEons </em>-- by the highest and the earliest <em>Nirvanees.
 </em>It was the turn of those "Gods" to incarnate in
 the present Manvantara; hence their presence on Earth, and the
 ensuing allegories; hence, also, the perversion of the original
 meaning.* The Gods who had <em>fallen </em>into generation, whose
 mission it was to complete <em>divine</em> man, are found represented
 later on as Demons, evil Spirits, and fiends, at feud and war
 with Gods, or the irresponsible agents of the one Eternal law.
 But no conception of such creatures as the devils and Satan of
 the Christian, Jewish, and Mahomedan religions was ever intended
 under those thousand and one Aryan allegories.** (<em>See </em>"<em>The
 Fallen Angels</em>"<em> and </em>"<em>The Mystic Dragons</em>"<em>
 in Part II.</em>)
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * So, for instance, in the Puranas, "Pulastya," a Prajapati,
 or son of Brahma -- the progenitor of the Rakshasas, and the grandfather
 of Ravana, the Great King of Lanka (<em>see Ramayana</em>)<em>
 </em>-- had, <em>in</em> <em>a former birth, </em>a son named
 Dattoli, "who is now known as the sage Agastya" -- says
 Vishnu Purana. This name of Dattoli alone, has six more variants
 to it, or seven meanings. He is called respectively, Dattoi, Dattali,
 Dattotti, Dattotri, Dattobhri, Dambhobhi and Dambholi -- which
 seven variants have each a secret sense, and refer in the esoteric
 comments to various ethnological classifications, and also to
 physiological and anthropological mysteries of the primitive races.
 For, surely, the Rakshasas are not <em>demons, </em>but simply
 the primitive and ferocious giants, the Atlanteans, who were scattered
 on the face of the globe as the Fifth Race is now. Vasishta is
 a warrant to this, if his words addressed to Parasara, who attempted
 a bit of JADOO (sorcery), which he calls "sacrifice,"
 for the destruction of the Rakshasas, mean anything. For he says,
 "Let no more of <em>these unoffending </em>'<em>Spirits Darkness</em>'<em>
 </em>be destroyed." (<em>see for details Adiparvan, s. </em>176<em>,
 Mahabharata</em>;<em> also the Linga Purana </em>"<em>Purvardha,</em>"<em>
 s. </em>64.)
 </p><p>
 ** We have a passage from a Master's letter which has a direct
 bearing upon these [[Footnote continued on next page]] </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 233 HOLY SATAN.</h6>
 
 <p>
 The true esoteric view about "Satan," the opinion held
 on this subject by the whole philosophic antiquity, is admirably
 brought out in an appendix, entitled "The Secret of Satan,"
 to the second edition of Dr. A. Kingsford's "Perfect Way."
 No better and clearer indication of the truth could be offered
 to the intelligent reader, and it is therefore quoted here at
 some length: --
 </p><p>
 "1. And on the seventh day (seventh creation of the Hindus),*
 there went forth from the presence of God a <em>mighty Angel,
 </em>full of wrath and consuming, and God gave him the dominion
 of the outermost sphere.**
 </p><p>
 2. "Eternity brought forth Time; the Boundless gave birth
 to Limit; Being descended into generation."***
 </p><p>
 4<em>. </em>"<em>Among the Gods is none like unto him, </em>into
 whose hands are committed the kingdoms, the power and the glory
 of the worlds:"
 </p><p>
 5. "Thrones and empires, the dynasties of kings,**** the
 fall of nations, the birth of churches, the triumph of Time."
 </p><p>
 For, as is said in Hermes, "Satan is the door-keeper of the
 <em>Temple of the King</em>;<em> </em>he standeth in Solomon's
 porch; he holdeth <em>the key of the Sanctuary, </em>that no man
 enter therein, save the Anointed having the arcanum of Hermes"
 (v. 20 and 21).
 </p><p>
 These suggestive and majestic verses had reference with the ancient
 Egyptians and other civilized peoples of antiquity to the <em>creative
 and generative light of the Logos </em>(Horus, Brahma, Ahura-Mazda,
 etc., etc., as primeval manifestations of the ever-unmanifested
 Principle, <em>e.g.</em>, Ain-Soph, Parabrahm, or <em>Zeruana
 </em>Akerne-- Boundless Time -- <em>Kala</em>), but the

 <p>
 [[Footnote continued from previous page]] incarnating angels.
 Says the letter: "Now there are, and there must be, failures
 in the ethereal races of the many classes of Dhyan-Chohans, or
 Devas (<em>progressed entities of a previous </em>planetary period),
 as well as among men. But still, as the <em>failures </em>are
 too far progressed and spiritualized to be thrown back forcibly
 from Dhyan-Chohanship into the vortex of a new primordial evolution
 through the lower Kingdoms, this then happens. Where a new solar
 system has to be evolved these Dhyan-Chohans are borne in by influx
 'ahead' of the Elementals (Entities . . . to be developed into
 humanity at a <em>future </em>time) and remain as a latent or
 inactive spiritual force, in the aura of a nascent world . . .
 until the stage of human evolution is reached. . . . Then they
 <em>become an active force </em>and commingle with the Elementals,
 to <em>develop little by little the full type of humanity.</em>"<em>
 </em>That is to say, to develop in, and endow man with his Self-conscious
 mind, or <em>Manas.</em> 
 </p><p>
 * When the earth with its planetary chain and man were to appear.

 Pitris of various classes were commissioned -- the one to evolve
 their images<em> </em>(<em>Chhaya</em>),<em> </em>and make of
 them physical man, the others to inform and thus endow him with
 divine intelligence and the comprehension of the <em>Mysteries
 of Creation.</em> 
 </p><p>
 **** The "dynasties of the kings" who all regard themselves
 as the "anointed," reigning "by the Grace of God,"
 whereas in truth, they reign by the grace of <em>matter, </em>the
 great <em>Illusion, </em>the Deceiver.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 234 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 meaning is now degraded in the Kabala. The "Anointed,"
 who has the secrets and mysteries of Hermes (<em>Buddha, </em>Wisdom),
 and who alone is entrusted with the key to the "Sanctuary,"
 the Womb of nature, in order to fructify it and call to active
 life and being the whole Kosmos, has become, with the Jews, Jehovah,
 the "God of generation" on the lunar mountain (Sinai,
 the mountain of the moon, "<em>Sin</em>")<em>. </em>The
 "Sanctuary" has become the "Holy of Holies,"
 and the arcanum has been anthropomorphised and <em>phallicised
 </em>and dragged down into matter, indeed. Hence arose the necessity
 of making of the "Dragon of Wisdom," the <em>Serpent
 of Genesis: </em>of the conscious god who needed a body to clothe
 his too subjective divinity, Satan. But the "innumerable
 incarnations of Spirit," and "the ceaseless pulse and
 current of desire" refer, the first one, to our doctrine
 of Karmic and cyclic rebirths, the second -- to <strong>E</strong>ROS,
 not the later god of material, physiological love, but to the
 divine desire in the gods, as well as in all nature, to create
 and give life to Beings. This, the Rays of the one "dark,"
 because invisible and incomprehensible, <strong>F</strong>LAME
 could achieve only by themselves descending into matter. Therefore,
 as continued in the <strong>A</strong>PPENDIX:
 </p><p>
 12. "Many names hath God given him (Satan), names of mystery,
 secret and terrible."
 </p><p>
 13. "The Adversary, because matter opposeth Spirit. Time
 accuseth even the Saints of the Lord."
 </p><p>
 28, 29, 31. "Stand in awe of him, and sin not; speak his
 name with trembling . . . . For Satan is the magistrate of the
 justice of God (Karma); he beareth the balance and the sword .
 . . . For to him <em>are committed Weight and Measure and Number.</em>"
 </p><p>
 Compare the last sentence with what the Rabbi, who explains the
 Kabala to Prince <em>Al-Chazari </em>in the Book of that name,
 says; and it will be found that the <em>Weight and Measure and
 Number </em>are, in <em>Sepher Jezirah,</em> the attributes of
 the Sephiroth (the three <em>Sephrim, </em>or figures, ciphers)
 covering the whole collective number of 10; and that the Sephiroth
 are the collective Adam Kadmon, the "Heavenly Man" or
 the <em>Logos. </em>Thus Satan and the anointed were identified
 in ancient thought. Therefore,
 </p><p>
 33. "Satan is the minister of God, Lord of the seven mansions
 of Hades" . . . .
 </p><p>
 The seven or <em>Saptaloka </em>of the Earth with the Hindus;
 for Hades, or the Limbo of Illusion, of which theology makes a
 region bordering on Hell,<em> is simply our globe, the Earth,
 </em>and thus Satan is called --
 </p><p>
 33 ". . . . the angel of the <em>manifest Worlds.</em>"
 </p><p>
 It is "Satan who is the god of our planet and <em>the only
 </em>god," and this without any allusive metaphor to its
 wickedness and depravity. For he is one with the Logos, "the
 first son, <em>eldest of the gods,</em>"<em> </em>in the
 order</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 235 THE SHADOW OF GOD.</h6>
 
 <p>
 of microcosmic (divine) evolution; Saturn (Satan), astronomically,
 "is <em>the seventh and last </em>in the order of macrocosmic
 emanation, being the circumference of the kingdom of which Phoebus
 (the light of wisdom, also the Sun) is the centre." The Gnostics
 were right, then, in calling the Jewish god "an angel of
 matter," or he who breathed (conscious) life into Adam, and
 he whose planet was Saturn.
 </p><p>
 34. "And God hath put a girdle about his loins (the rings
 of Saturn), and the name of the girdle is Death."
 </p><p>
 In anthropogony this "girdle" is the human body with
 its two lower principles, which three die, while the innermost
 man is immortal. And now we approach the "<em>Secret </em>of
 Satan."
 </p><p>
 37, 38, 39. " . . . Upon Satan only <em>is the shame of generation.

 limits all things. . . ."
 </p><p>
 42, 43, 44. "Twain are the armies of God: in heaven the hosts
 of Michael; in the abyss (the manifested world) the legions of
 Satan. These are the unmanifest and the manifest; the free and
 the bound (in matter): the virginal and the fallen. And both are
 the Ministers of the Father, fulfilling the word Divine. . . ."
 Therefore --

 For, "The glory of Satan is the shadow of the Lord":
 God in the manifested world; "the throne of Satan is the
 footstool of Adonai" -- that footstool being the whole <strong>K</strong>osmos.
 (<em>Vide </em>Part <b>II</b>., "<em>Is Pleroma Satan</em>'<em>s
 Lair?</em>")
 </p><p>
 When the Church, therefore, curses Satan, it curses the cosmic
 reflection of God; it anathematizes God made manifest in matter
 or in the objective; it maledicts God, or the ever-incomprehensible
 <strong>W</strong>ISDOM, revealing itself as Light and Shadow,
 good and evil in nature, in the only manner comprehensible to
 the limited intellect of <strong>M</strong>AN.
 </p><p>
 This is the true philosophical and metaphysical interpretation
 of Samael, or Satan, the adversary in the Kabala; the same tenets
 and spirit being found in the allegorical interpretations of every
 other ancient religion. This philosophical view does not interfere,
 however, with the<em> historical </em>records connected with it.
 We say "historical," because allegory and a mythical
 ornamentation around the kernel of tradition, in no wise prevent
 that kernel being a record of real events. Thus, the Kabala, repeating
 the time-honoured revelations of the once universal history of
 our globe and the evolution of its races, has presented it under
 the legendary form of the various records which have formed the
 Bible. Its historical foundation is now offered, in however imperfect
 a form, on these pages from the Secret Doctrine of the East; and
 thus</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 236 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 the allegorical and symbolical meaning of the Serpent of Genesis
 is found explained by the "Sons of Wisdom" (or angels
 from higher spheres, though all and each pertain to the kingdom
 of Satan, or Matter) revealing to men the mysteries of Heaven.
 Hence, also, all the so-called myths of the Hindu, Grecian, Chaldean,
 and Jewish Pantheons are found to be built on fact and truth.
 The giants of Genesis are the historical Atlanteans of Lanka,
 and the Greek Titans.
 </p><p>
 Who can forget that Troy was once upon a time proclaimed a myth,
 and Homer a non-existing personage, while the existence of such
 cities as Herculaneum and Pompeii was denied, and attributed to
 mere fairy legends? Yet Schliemann proved that Troy had really
 existed, and the two cities, though buried for long ages under
 the Vesuvian lava, have had their resurrection day, and live again
 on the surface of the earth. How many more cities and localities
 called "fabulous" are on the list of future discoveries,
 how many more personages regarded as mythical* will one day become
 historical, those alone can tell who read the decrees of Fate
 in the astral light.
 </p><p>
 As the tenets of the Eastern doctrine, however, have always been
 kept secret, and as the reader can hardly hope to be shown the
 original texts unless he becomes an accepted disciple, let the
 Greek and Latin scholar turn to the original texts of Hermetic
 literature. Let him, for one thing, read carefully the opening
 pages of the <em>Pymander </em>of Hermes Trismegistus; and then
 he will see our doctrines corroborated in it, however veiled its
 text. There also he will find the evolution of the Universe, of
 our Earth (called "Nature" in Pymander) as of everything
 else, from the "Moyst Principle" -- or the great Deep,
 <strong>F</strong>ATHER-<strong>M</strong>OTHER -- the first differentiation
 in the manifested Kosmos. First the "Universal Mind,"
 which the hand of the Christian translator has metamorphosed in
 the earliest renderings into God, the Father: then the "Heavenly
 Man,"** which is the great Total of that Host of Angels,
 which was too pure for the creation of the inferior worlds or
 of the men of our globe, but which <em>fell</em> nevertheless
 <em>into matter </em>by virtue of that same evolution, as the
 second <em>logos </em>of the "Father."***

 </p><p>
 ** The "Heavenly Man" -- please mark again the word
 -- is "the <strong>L</strong>OGOS" or the "Son"
 esoterically. Therefore, once that the title was applied to Christ
 (declared God and the very God himself) Christian theology had
 no choice. In order to support its dogma of the personal Trinity
 it had to proclaim, as it does, that the Christian <em>Logos </em>is
 the only true one, and that all the <em>Logoi </em>of other religions
 were false, and only the masquerading Evil Principles, <strong>S</strong>ATAN.
 Now see where this led Western theology to.

 Synthetically every Creative Logos, or "the Son who is one
 with the Father," is the Host of the Rectores Mundi in itself.
 Even Christian theology makes of the seven "Angels of the
 Presence" the Virtues, or the personified attributes of God,
 which, being created by him, as the Manus were by Brahma, became
 Archangels. The Roman Catholic <em>theodice </em>itself recognising,
 in its creative <em>Verbum Princeps, </em>the head of those angels
 <em>-- caput angelorum -- </em>and the <em>magni consilii Angelus
 </em>(the Angel of the great Counsel), thus recognizes the identity
 of Christ and those Angels.
 </p><p>
 "<em>The Gods became no-Gods, the Sura -- A</em>-sura,"
 says the text; <em>i.e</em>., gods became fiends -- <strong>S</strong>ATAN,
 when read literally. But Satan will now be shown, in the teaching
 of the Secret Doctrine, allegorized as Good, and Sacrifice, a
 God of Wisdom, under different names.
 </p><p>
 The Kabala teaches that Pride and Presumption -- the two chief
 prompters of Selfishness and Egotism -- are the causes that emptied
 heaven of <em>one third </em>of its divine denizens -- mystically,
 and of <em>one third </em>of the stars -- astronomically; in other
 words, the two statements are -- the first an allegory, and the
 second a fact. The former, nevertheless, as shown, is intimately
 connected with humanity.
 </p><p>
 In their turn the Rosicrucians, who were well acquainted with
 the secret meaning of the tradition, kept it to themselves, teaching
 merely that the whole of <em>creation </em>was due to, and the
 result of, that legendary "War in Heaven" <em>brought
 on by the rebellion of the angels</em>*<em> against creative law,
 </em>or the Demiurge. The statement is correct, but the <em>inner
 </em>meaning is to this day a mystery. To elude further explanation
 of the difficulty by appealing to divine mystery, or to the sin
 of prying into its policy -- is to say nothing at all. It may
 prove sufficient to

 Here it is evident that "Mind" (the primeval universal
 Divine Thought) is neither the Unknown unmanifested One, since
 it abounds in both sexes (is male and female), nor yet the Christian
 Father, as the latter is a male and not an androgyne. The fact
 is that the <em>Father, Son, and Man </em>are hopelessly mixed
 up in the translations of Pymander.

 * The allegory of the fire of Prometheus is another version of
 the rebellion of the proud Lucifer, who was <em>hurled down to
 the bottomless pit, </em>or simply unto our Earth, to live as
 man. The Hindu Lucifer, the <em>Mahasura, </em>is also said to
 have become envious of the Creator's resplendent light, and, at
 the head of inferior Asuras (not gods, but spirits), to have rebelled
 against Brahma; for which Siva hurled him down to Patala. But,
 as philosophy goes hand in hand with allegorical fiction in Hindu
 myths, the <em>devil</em> is made to repent, and is afforded the
 opportunity to progress: he is a sinful man <em>esoterically,
 </em>and can by <em>yoga </em>devotion, and adeptship, reach his
 status of <em>one with the deity, </em>once more. Hercules, the
 Sun-god, descends to Hades (the cave of Initiation) to deliver
 the victims from their tortures, etc., etc. The Christian Church

 believers in the Pope's infallibility, but will hardly satisfy
 the philosophical mind. Yet the truth, although known to most
 of the higher Kabalists, has never been told by any of their number.
 One and all, Kabalists and symbologists, showed an extraordinary
 reluctance to confess the primitive meaning of the Fall of the
 Angels. In a Christian such silence is only natural. Neither alchemist
 nor philosopher could, during the Mediaeval Ages, utter that*

 for it would have led them directly through the "Holy"
 office of the Inquisition, to stake and rack. But for our modern
 Kabalists and Freethinkers the case is different. With the latter,
 we fear, it is merely human pride, vanity based on a loudly rejected
 and as ineradicable superstition. Since the Church, in her struggle

 * Why should, for instance, Eliphas Levi, the very <em>fearless
 </em>and outspoken Kabalist, have hesitated to divulge the mystery
 of the <em>Fallen</em> Angels so-called? That he knew the fact
 and real meaning of the allegory -- both in its religious and
 mystical, as well as in its physiological sense -- is proved by
 his voluminous writings and frequent allusions and hints. Yet
 Eliphas, after having alluded to it a hundred times in his previous
 works, says in his latest "<em>Histoire de la Magie,</em>"<em>
 </em>p. 220 . . . "We protest with all our might against
 the sovereignty and the ubiquity of Satan. We <em>pretend neither
 to deny nor affirm here the tradition on the Fall of the Angels
 </em>. . . but if so, then the prince of the Angelic Rebels can
 be at best the last and the most powerless among the condemned
 -- now that he is separated from deity -- which is the principle
 of every power. . . ." This is hazy and evasive enough; but
 see what Hargrave Jennings writes in his weird, <em>staccato-like
 </em>style: --
 </p><p>
 "Both Saint Michael and Saint George are types. They are
 sainted personages, or dignified heroes, or powers apotheosized.
 They are each represented with their appropriate faculties and
 attributes. These are reproduced and stand multiplied -- distinguished
 by different names in all the mythologies . . . (including the
 Christian). . . .
 </p><p>
 The idea regarding each is a general one. This idea and representative
 notion is that of the all-powerful champion -- child-like in his
 'Virgin innocence' -- so powerful that this god-filled innocence
 (the Seraphim 'Know most,' the Cherubim 'love most') can shatter
 the world (articulated, so to use the word -- in the magic of
 Lucifer, but condemned) in opposition to the artful constructions
 (this 'side-life') of the magnificent apostate, the mighty rebel,
 but yet at the same time the 'Light-bringer,' the Lucifer, the
 'Morning Star,' the 'Son of the morning' -- the very highest title
 'out of heaven, 'for in heaven it cannot be, but out of heaven
 it is everything. In an apparently incredible side of his character
 -- qualities are of no sex -- this archangel, St. Michael, is
 the <em>invincible, sexless, celestial </em>'Energy' -- to dignify
 him by his grand characteristics -- the invisible 'Virgin Combatant,'
 clothed . . . and at the same time armed, in the denying mail
 of the Gnostic 'refusal to create.' This is another . . . 'myth
 within myths' . . . a stupendous 'mystery of mysteries,' because
 it is so impossible and contradictory. Unexplainable as the Apocalypse.
 Unrevealable as the 'Revelation' "(<em>p</em>. 213).
 </p><p>
 Nevertheless, this <em>unexplainable and unrevealable </em>mystery
 will now be explained and revealed by the doctrines of the East.
 But as the very erudite, but still more puzzling author of "Phallicism"
 gives it, of course, no uninitiated mortal would ever understand
 the real drift of his remarks.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 239 THEOLOGICAL SNUFFERS.</h6>
 
 <p>
 a theological extinguisher on the radiant star-god, <em>Lucifer,
 </em>the "Son of the Morning," thus created the most
 gigantic of all her paradoxes -- <em>a black and tenebrous light
 -- </em>the myth has struck its roots too deep in the soil of
 blind faith to permit, in our age, even those, who do not acquiesce
 in her dogmas and laugh at her horned and cloven-footed Satan,
 to come out bravely and confess the antiquity of the oldest of
 all traditions. In a few brief words it is this. <em>Semi-exoterically,
 </em>the "First-born" of the Almighty -- <em>Fiat Lux,
 </em>-- or the angels of primordial light, were commanded <em>to
 create</em>;<em> </em>one third of them rebelled <em>and refused</em>;<em>
 </em>while those who "obeyed as Fetahil did <em>-- failed</em>"<em>
 </em>most signally.
 </p><p>
 To realise the refusal and failure in their correct physical meaning,
 one must study and <em>understand </em>Eastern philosophy; one
 has to be acquainted with the fundamental mystical tenets of the
 Vedantins, with regard to the utter fallacy of attributing functional
 activity to the infinite and absolute deity. Esoteric philosophy
 maintains that during<em> </em>the <em>Sandhyas, </em>the "Central
 Sun" emits <em>creative light -</em>- passively so to say.
 <em>Causality </em>is latent. It is only during the active periods
 of being that it gives rise to a stream of ceaseless energy, whose
 vibrating currents acquire more activity and potency with every
 rung of the hebdomadic ladder of Being which they descend. Hence
 it becomes comprehensible how the process of <em>creating, </em>or
 rather of fashioning, the organic Universe, with all its units
 of the seven kingdoms, necessitated intelligent beings -- who
 became collectively a Being or creative God -- differentiated
 already from the one absolute Unity, unrelated as the latter is
 to conditioned creation.*
 </p><p>
 Now the Vatican <strong>MSS.</strong> of the Kabala -- a single
 copy of which (in Europe) is said to have been in the possession
 of Count St. Germain -- contains the most complete exposition
 of the doctrine, including the peculiar version accepted by the
 Luciferians** and other Gnostics; and in that parchment the <em>Seven
 Suns of Life </em>are given in the order they are found in the
 <em>Saptasurya. </em>Only four of these, however, are mentioned
 in the editions of the Kabala which are procurable in the public
 libraries, and that even in a more or less veiled phraseology.
 Nevertheless even this reduced number is amply sufficient to show
 an identical origin, as it refers to the quaternary group of the
 Dhyan-Chohans, and proves the speculation to have had its origin
 in the Secret Doctrines of the Aryans.

 ** The Luciferians -- the sect of the fourth century who are alleged
 to have taught that the Soul was a <em>carnal </em>body transmitted
 to the child by its father; -- and that other religious and still
 earlier sect of the second century <strong>A.D</strong>., the
 Lucianists, who taught all this, and further, that the <em>animal
 </em>Soul was not immortal, were philosophizing on the grounds
 of the real Kabalistic and Occult teachings.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 240 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 As is well known, the Kabala never originated with the Jews, who
 got their ideas from the Chaldeans and the Egyptians.
 </p><p>
 Thus even the now <em>exoteric </em>Kabalistic teachings speak
 of a <em>Central </em>Sun, and of three secondary suns in each
 solar system -- our own included. As shown in that able though
 too materialistic work, "<em>New Aspects of Life and Religion,</em>"<em>
 </em>which is a <em>synopsis of the views </em>of the Kabalists
 in an aspect deeply thought out and assimilated: --
 </p><p>
 "The <em>Central Sun </em>. . . <em>was to them </em>(as
 much as to the Aryans) <em>the centre of Rest</em>;<em> </em>the
 centre to which all motion was to be ultimately referred. Round
 this central sun . . . 'the first of three systemic suns . . .
 revolved on a polar plane . . . the second, on an equatorial plane'
 . . . and the third only was our visible sun. These four solar
 bodies were '<em>the organs on whose action what man calls the
 creation, the evolution of life on the planet, earth, depends.</em>'<em>
 </em>The channels through which the influence of these bodies
 was conveyed to the earth they (the Kabalists) held to be electrical"
 (<em>p</em>. 287). . . . "The radiant energy flowing from
 the central sun* called the Earth into being as a watery globe,"
 whose tendency, "as the nucleus of a planetary body, was
 to rush to the (central) Sun . . . . within the sphere of whose
 attraction it had been created," "but the radiant energy,
 similarly electrifying both, withheld the one from the other,
 and so changed motion towards into motion round the centre of
 attraction, which the revolving planet (earth) thus sought to
 reach.
 </p><p>
 "In the organic cell the <em>visible sun </em>found its own
 proper matrix, and produced through this the animal (while maturing
 the vegetable) Kingdom, finally placing man at its head, in whom,
 through the animating action of that Kingdom, it originated the
 psychic cell. But the man so placed at the head of the animal
 kingdom, at the head of the creation, was the animal, the <em>soul-less,
 the perishable man</em>. . . . Hence man, although apparently
 its crown, would, by his advent have marked the close of creation;
 since creation, culminating in him, would at his death have entered
 on its decline" . . . (<em>p</em>. 289).
 </p><p>
 This Kabalistic view is here quoted, to show its perfect identity
 in spirit with the Eastern doctrine. Explain, or complete the
 teaching of the seven Suns with the seven systems of <em>planes
 of being, </em>of which the "Suns" are the central bodies,
 and you have the seven angelic planes,
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * This "central sun" of the Occultists, which even Science
 is obliged to accept astronomically, for it cannot deny the presence
 in Sidereal Space of a central body in the milky way, a point
 unseen and mysterious, the ever-hidden centre of attraction of
 our Sun and system -- this "Sun" is viewed differently
 by the Occultists of the East. While the Western and Jewish Kabalists
 (and even some pious modern astronomers) claim that in this sun
 the God-head is specially present -- referring to it the volitional
 acts of God -- the Eastern Initiates maintain that, as the <em>supradivine
 </em>Essence of the Unknown Absolute is equally in every domain
 and place, the "Central Sun" is simply the centre of
 Universal life-Electricity; the reservoir within which that divine
 radiance, already differentiated at the beginning of every <em>creation,
 </em>is focussed. Though still in a <em>laya, </em>or neutral
 condition, it is, nevertheless, the one attracting, as also the
 ever-emitting, life Centre.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 241 "PRINCIPLES" EXPLAINED.</h6>
 
 <p>
 whose "Host" are gods thereof, collectively. (<em>See
 Comm. to Stanza VII Book I</em>.)<em> </em>They are the Head-group
 divided into four classes from the <em>incorporeal </em>down to
 the semi-corporeal, which classes are directly connected -- though
 in very different ways as regards voluntary connection and functions
 -- with our mankind. They are three, synthesized by the fourth
 (the first and highest), which is called the "Central Sun"
 in the Kabalistic doctrine just quoted. This is the great difference
 between the Semitic and the Aryan Cosmogony; one materializing,
 humanizes the mysteries of nature; the other spiritualizes matter,
 and its physiology is always made subservient to metaphysics.
 Thus, though the seventh principle reaches man through all the
 phases of being, pure as an indiscrete element and an impersonal
 unity, it passes through (the Kabala teaches <em>from</em>) the
 Central Spiritual Sun and Group the second (the <em>polar </em>Sun),
 which two radiate on man his Atma. Group <em>Three </em>(the equatorial
 Sun) cement the Buddhi to Atman and the higher attributes of <em>Manas,
 </em>while group Four (the spirit of our visible sun) endows him
 with his Manas and its vehicle -- the <em>Kama rupa, </em>or body
 of passions and desires, the two elements of <em>Ahamkara </em>which
 evolve <em>individualized consciousness -- </em>the personal <em>ego.
 </em>Finally, it is the spirit of the Earth in its triple unity
 that builds the physical body, attracting to it the Spirits of
 Life and forming his <em>Linga Sarira.</em> 
 </p><p>
 Now, as everything proceeds cyclically, the evolution of man like
 everything else, the order in which he is generated is described
 fully in the Eastern teachings, whereas it is only hinted at in
 the Kabala. Says <em>the Book of Dzyan </em>with regard to primeval
 man when first projected by the "Boneless," the incorporeal
 Creator: "<em>First, the Breath, then Buddhi, and the Shadow-Son
 </em>(the Body)<em> were </em>'CREATED.' <em>But where was the
 pivot </em>(the middle principle, Manas)? <em>Man is doomed. When
 alone, the indiscrete </em>(undifferentiated Element) <em>and
 the Vahan </em>(Buddhi) -- <em>the cause of the causeless -- break
 asunder from manifested life</em>"<em> -- </em>"<em>unless
 cemented and held together by the middle principle, the vehicle
 of the personal consciousness of </em><strong>J</strong>IVA";
 explains the Commentary. In other words, the two higher principles
 <em>can have no individuality on Earth, </em>cannot be <em>man,
 </em>unless there is (<em>a</em>)<em> </em>the Mind, the <em>Manas-Ego,
 to </em>cognize itself, and (<em>b</em>) the terrestrial <em>false
 </em>personality, or the body of egotistical desires and personal
 Will, to cement the whole, as if round a pivot (which it is, truly),
 to the physical form of man. It is the <em>Fifth </em>and the
 <em>Fourth </em>principles* -- <em>Manas </em>and <em>Kama rupa
 -- </em>that contain the dual personality: the real immortal Ego<em>
 </em>(<em>if it assimilates itself to the two higher</em>) and
 the false and transitory personality, the <em>mayavi </em>or astral
 body, so-called, or the <em>animal-human </em>Soul -- the two

 ing to be closely blended for purposes of a <em>full </em>terrestrial
 existence. Incarnate the Spiritual Monad of a Newton grafted on
 that of the greatest saint on earth -- in a physical body the
 most perfect you can think of -- <em>i.e.</em>, in a two or even
 a three-principled body composed of its <em>Sthula Sarira, </em>prana
 (life principle), and <em>linga sarira -- </em>and, if it lacks
 its middle and fifth principles, you will have created <em>an
 idiot -- </em>at best a beautiful, soul-less, empty and unconscious
 appearance. "<em>Cogito -- ergo sum</em>"<em> -- </em>can
 find no room in the brain of such a creature, not on this plane,
 at any rate.
 </p><p>
 There are students, however, who have long ago understood the
 philosophical meaning underlying the allegory -- so tortured and
 disfigured by the Roman Church -- of the <em>Fallen </em>Angels.
 "The Kingdom of Spirits and spiritual action which flows
 from and is the product of Spirit Volition, is outside and contrasted
 with and in contradiction to the Kingdom of (divine) Souls and
 divine action."* As said in the text: --
 </p><p>
 "<em>Like produces like and no more at the genesis of being,
 and evolution with its limited conditioned laws comes later. The
 Self-Existentt are called </em><strong>C</strong><em>REATIONS,
 for they appear in the Spirit Ray, manifested through the potency
 inherent in its UNBORN Nature, which is beyond time and </em>(limited
 or conditioned) <em>Space. Terrene products, animate and inanimate,
 including mankind, are falsely called creation and creatures:
 they are the development </em>(<em>evolution</em>)<em> of the
 discrete elements.</em>"<em> </em>(Com. xiv.) Again: --
 </p><p>
 "<em>The Heavenly rupa </em>(Dhyan Chohan) <em>creates</em>
 (<em>man</em>)<em> in his own form</em>;<em> it is a spiritual
 ideation consequent on the first differentiation and awakening
 of the universal </em>(<em>manifested</em>)<em> Substance</em>;<em>
 that form is the ideal shadow of Itself: and this is </em>THE
 MAN OF THE FIRST RACE."
 </p><p>
 To express it in still clearer form, limiting the explanation
 to this earth only, it was the duty of the first "differentiated
 Egos" -- the Church calls them Archangels -- to imbue primordial
 matter with the evolutionary impulse and guide its formative powers
 in the fashioning of its productions. This it is which is referred
 to in the sentences both in the Eastern and Western tradition
 --"the Angels were <em>commanded to create.</em>"<em>
 </em>After the Earth had been made ready by the <em>lower </em>and
 more material powers, and its three Kingdoms fairly started on
 their way to be "fruitful and multiply," the higher
 powers, the Archangels or Dhyanis, were compelled by the evolutionary
 Law to descend on Earth, in order to construct the crown of its
 evolution -- MAN. Thus the "Self-created"

 and the "Self-existent" projected their pale shadows;
 but group the Third, the Fire-Angels, <em>rebelled and refused
 </em>to join their Fellow Devas.
 </p><p>
 Hindu exotericism represents them all as <em>Yogins, </em>whose
 piety inspired them to refuse <em>creating, </em>as they desired
 to remain eternally <em>Kumaras, </em>"Virgin Youths,"
 in order to, if possible, anticipate their fellows in progress
 towards Nirvana -- the final liberation. But, agreeably to esoteric
 interpretation, it was a self-sacrifice for the benefit of mankind.
 The "Rebels" would not create will-less irresponsible
 men, as the "obedient" angels did; nor could they endow
 human beings with only the temporary reflections of their own
 attributes; for even the latter, belonging to another and a so-much
 higher plane of consciousness, would leave man still irresponsible,
 hence interfere with any possibility of a higher progress. No
 spiritual and psychic evolution is possible on earth -- the lowest
 and most material plane -- for one who on that plane, at all events,
 is inherently <em>perfect </em>and cannot accumulate either merit
 or demerit. Man remaining the pale shadow of the inert, immutable,
 and motionless perfection, the one negative and passive attribute
 of the real <em>I am that I am, </em>would have been doomed to
 pass through life on earth as in a heavy dreamless sleep; hence
 a failure on this plane. The Beings, or the Being, collectively
 called Elohim, who first (if ever) pronounced the cruel words,
 "Behold, the man is become <em>as one of us, </em>to know
 good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand and take also
 of the tree of life and eat and live for ever . . . " must
 have been indeed the Ilda-baoth, the <em>Demiurge </em>of the
 Nazarenes, filled with rage and envy against his own creature,
 whose reflection created <em>Ophiomorphos. </em>In this case it
 is but natural -- even from the dead letter standpoint -- to view
 <em>Satan, </em>the Serpent of Genesis, as the real creator and
 benefactor, the Father of Spiritual mankind. For it is he who
 was the "Harbinger of Light," bright radiant Lucifer,
 who opened the eyes of the automaton <em>created </em>by Jehovah,
 as alleged; and he who was the first to whisper: "in the
 day ye eat thereof ye shall be as Elohim, knowing good and evil"
 -- can only be regarded in the light of a Saviour. An "adversary"
 to Jehovah the "<em>personating </em>spirit," he still
 remains in esoteric truth the ever-loving "Messenger"
 (the angel), the Seraphim and Cherubim who both <em>knew </em>well,
 and <em>loved </em>still more, and who conferred on us spiritual,
 instead of physical immortality -- the latter a kind <em>of static
 </em>immortality that would have transformed man into an undying
 "Wandering Jew."
 </p><p>
 As narrated in King's "Gnostics," "Ilda-Baoth,
 whom several sects regarded as the God of Moses, was not a pure

 light of the middle space offered him by his mother Sophia-Achamoth,
 he set himself to create a world of his own. Aided by his sons,
 the six planetary genii, he fabricated man,</p><hr>

 <p>
 but this one proved a failure. It was a monster, soulless, ignorant,
 and crawling on all fours on the ground like a material beast.
 Ilda-Baoth was forced to implore the help of his spiritual mother.
 She communicated to him a ray of her divine light, and so animated
 man and endowed him with a soul. And now began the animosity of
 Ilda-Baoth toward his own creature. Following the impulse of the
 divine light, man soared higher and higher in his aspirations;
 very soon he began presenting not the image of his creator Ilda-Baoth
 but rather that of the Supreme Being, the 'primitive man,' Ennoia.
 Then the Demiurgos was filled with rage and envy; and fixing his
 jealous eye on the abyss of matter, his looks envenomed with passion
 were suddenly reflected as in a mirror; the reflection became
 animate, and there arose out of the abyss Satan, serpent, Ophiomorphos
 -- 'the embodiment of envy and cunning. He is the union of all
 that is most base in matter, with the hate, envy, and craft of
 a spiritual intelligence.' " This is the exoteric rendering
 of the Gnostics, and the allegory, though a <em>sectarian </em>version,
 is suggestive, and seems true to life. It is the natural deduction
 from the dead letter text of chapter iii. of Genesis.
 </p><p>
 Hence the allegory of Prometheus, who steals the divine fire so
 as to allow men to proceed consciously on the path of spiritual
 evolution, thus transforming the most perfect of <em>animals </em>on
 earth into a potential god, and making him free to "take
 the kingdom of heaven by violence." Hence also, the <em>curse
 </em>pronounced by Zeus against Prometheus, and by Jehovah-Il-da-Baoth
 against his "rebellious son," Satan. The cold, pure
 snows of the Caucasian mountain and the never-dying, singeing
 fire and flames of an extinguishable hell. Two poles, yet the
 same idea; the dual aspect of a refined torture: a <em>fire producer
 -- </em>the personified emblem of [[<em>Phosphoros</em>]] of the
 astral fire and light in the <em>anima mundi -- </em>(that element
 of which the German materialist philosopher Moleschott said: "ohne
 <em>phosphor </em>kein gedanke," <em>i.e.</em>, without phosphorus
 no thought), burning in the fierce flames of his terrestrial passions;
 the conflagration fired by his <em>Thought, </em>discerning as
 it now does good from evil, and yet a slave to the passions of
 its earthly Adam; feeling the vulture of doubt and full consciousness
 gnawing at its heart -- a<em> Prometheus indeed, because a conscious,
 </em>hence a <em>responsible </em>entity.* The curse of <em>life
 </em>is great, yet how few are those men, outside some Hindu and
 Sufi mystics, who would exchange all the tortures of conscious
 life, all the evils of a responsible existence, for the unconscious
 perfection of a passive (objectively) <em>in</em>cor<em>poreal
 </em>being, or even the universal static Inertia personified in
 Brahma during his "night's" rest. For, to quote from

 "Satan, or Lucifer, represents the <em>active, </em>or, as
 M. Jules Baissac calls it, the 'Centrifugal Energy of the Universe'
 in a cosmic sense. He is Fire, Light, Life, Struggle, Effort,
 Thought, Consciousness, Progress, Civilization, Liberty, Independence.
 At the same time he is pain, which is the Re-action of the <em>pleasure
 </em>of action, and <em>death -</em>- which is the revolution
 of <em>life </em>-- Satan, burning in his own hell, produced by
 the fury of his own momentum -- the expansive disintegration of
 the nebulae which is to concentrate into new worlds. And fitly
 is he again and again baffled by the eternal <em>Inertia </em>of
 the <em>passive </em>energy of the Kosmos -- the inexorable '<em>I
 AM</em>'<em> -- </em>the flint from which the sparks are beaten
 out. Fitly is he . . . and his adherents . . . consigned to the
 'sea of fire,' because it is the <em>Sun </em>(in one sense only
 in the Cosmic allegory), the fount of life in <em>our system,
 </em>where they are purified (disintegrated) and churned up to
 re-arrange them for another life (the resurrection); that <em>Sun</em>
 which, as the origin of the active principle of our Earth, is
 at once the <em>Home </em>and the <em>Source </em>of the Mundane
 Satan. . . ." To demonstrate furthermore the accuracy of
 Baissac's general theory (in <em>Le Diable et Satan</em>)<em>
 </em>cold is known to have a 'Centripetal' effect. "Under
 the influence of cold everything contracts. . . . Under it <em>life
 hybernates, </em>or dies out, thought congeals, and fire is extinguished.
 Satan is immortal in his own Fire-Sea -- it is only in the 'Nifl-heim'
 (the cold Hell of the Scandinavian <em>Eddas</em>) of the '<em>I
 AM</em>'<em> </em>that he cannot exist. But for all that there
 is a kind of <em>Immortal Existence </em>in the Nifl-heim, and
 that existence must be <em>painless and peaceful, </em>because
 it is <em>Unconscious and Inactive. </em>In the Kingdom of <em>Jehovah
 </em>(if this God were all that the Jews and Christians claim
 for him) there is no Misery, no War, no marrying and giving in
 marriage, no change, no <em>Individual Consciousness.</em>*<em>

 former) is in fact what Theosophy calls <em>Nirvana. </em>But
 then Theosophy teaches that separation from the <em>Primal Source
 having once occurred, </em>Re-union can only be achieved <em>by
 Will -- Effort </em>-- which is distinctly <em>Satanic </em>in
 the sense of this essay."
 </p><p>
 <em>It is </em>"Satanic" from the standpoint of orthodox
 Romanism, for it is owing to the prototype of that which became
 in time the Christian Devil -- to the Radiant Archangels, Dhyans-Chohans,
 who refused to create, because they wanted Man <em>to become his
 own creator </em>and an immortal god -- that men can reach <em>Nirvana
 </em>and the haven of heavenly divine Peace.
 </p><p>
 To close this rather lengthy comment, the Secret Doctrine teaches
 that the Fire-Devas, the Rudras, and the Kumaras, the "Virgin-Angels,"
 (to whom Michael and Gabriel, the Archangels, both belong), the
 divine "Rebels" -- called by the <em>all-materializing
 </em>and positive Jews, the <em>Nahash </em>or "Deprived"
 -- preferred the <em>curse of incarnation </em>and the long cycles
 of terrestrial existence and rebirths, to seeing the misery (even
 if <em>unconscious</em>)<em> </em>of the beings (evolved as shadows
 out of their Brethren) through the semi-passive energy of their
 <em>too spiritual </em>Creators. If "man's uses of life should
 be such as neither to animalize nor to spiritualize, but to <em>humanize
 </em>Self,"* before he can do so, he must be born <em>human
 </em>not angelic. Hence, tradition shows the celestial <em>Yogis
 </em>offering themselves as voluntary victims in order to redeem
 Humanity -- created god-like and perfect at first -- and to endow
 him with human affections and aspirations. To do this they had
 to give up their natural status and, descending on our globe,
 take up their abode on it for the whole cycle of the Mahayuga,
 thus exchanging their impersonal individualities for individual
 personalities -- the bliss of sidereal existence for the curse
 of terrestrial life. This voluntary sacrifice of the Fiery Angels,
 whose nature was <em>Knowledge and Love, </em>was construed by
 the exoteric theologies into a statement that shows "the
 rebel angels hurled down from heaven into the darkness of Hell"
 -- our Earth. Hindu philosophy hints at the truth by teaching
 that the <em>Asuras </em>hurled down by Siva, are only in an <em>intermediate
 state </em>in which they prepare for higher degrees of purification
 and redemption from their

 man (to the Jewish Rabbin, rather?) a bodiless, disembodied, or
 deprived, and degraded being, and hence was termed by the ideograph
 <em>Nahash </em>'Deprived;' represented as appearing to and seducing
 the human race -- men through the Woman. . . . In the picture
 from this Nahash, this spirit was represented by a serpent, because
 from its <em>destitution of bodily members, </em>the Serpent was
 looked upon as a deprived and depraved and degraded creature"

 wretched condition; but Christian theology, claiming to be based
 on the rock of divine love, charity, and justice of him it appeals
 to as its Saviour -- has invented, to enforce that claim paradoxically,
 the dreary dogma of hell, that Archimedean lever of Roman Catholic
 philosophy.
 </p><p>
 As to Rabbinical Wisdom -- than which there is none more positive,
 materialistic, or grossly terrestrial, as it brings everything
 down to physiological mysteries -- it calls these Beings, the
 "Evil One;" and the Kabalists <em>-- Nahash, </em>"Deprived,"
 as just said, and the <em>Souls, </em>that have thrown themselves,
 <em>after having been alienated in Heaven from the Holy One</em>,
 into an abyss at the dawn of their very existence, and have anticipated
 the time when they are to descend on earth. (<em>Zohar </em>iii.,
 61, <em>C.</em>)
 </p><p>
 And let me explain at once that our quarrel is not with the <em>Zohar
 </em>and the Kabala in their right interpretation -- for the latter
 is ours -- but only with the gross, <em>pseudo</em>-esoteric explanations
 of the later, and especially those of the Christian Kabalists.
 </p><p>
 "<em>Our earth and man,</em>"<em> </em>says the Commentary,
 "<em>being the products of the three Fires</em>"<em>
 -- </em>whose three names answer, in Sanskrit, to "<em>the
 electric fire, the Solar fire, and the fire produced by friction,</em>"<em>
 -- </em>these three fires, explained on the Cosmic and human planes,
 are Spirit, Soul, and Body, the three great Root groups, with
 their four additional divisions. These vary with the Schools,
 and become -- according to their applications -- the<em> upadhis
 </em>and the <em>vehicles, </em>or the <em>noumena </em>of these.
 In the exoteric accounts, they are personified by the "three
 sons of surpassing brilliancy and splendour" of Agni Abhimanin,
 the eldest son of Brahma, the <em>Cosmic </em><strong>L</strong>OGOS,
 by <em>Swaha, </em>one of Daksha's* daughters. In the metaphysical
 sense the "Fire of friction" means the Union between
 <em>Buddhi, </em>the sixth, and <em>Manas, </em>the fifth, principles,
 which thus are united or cemented together; the fifth merging
 partially into and becoming part of the <em>monad</em>;<em> </em>in
 the physical, it relates to the <em>creative spark, </em>or germ,
 which fructifies and generates the human being. The three Fires,
 it is said (whose names are Pavaka, Pavamana and Suchi) were condemned
 by a curse of Vasishta, the great sage, "<em>to be born over
 and over again.</em>"<em> </em>(Bhagavata-Purana iv. 24,
 4.) This is clear enough.
 </p><p>
 Therefore, the <em>FLAMES, </em>whose functions are confused in
 the exoteric books, and who are called indifferently Prajapati,
 Pitris, Manus, Asuras,

 * Daksha, the "intelligent, the competent." "This
 name generally carries with it the idea of <em>creative power.</em>"<em>
 </em>He is a son of Brahma, and of Aditi, and agreeably to other
 versions, a self-born power, which, like Minerva, sprang from
 his father's body. He is the chief of the <em>Prajapati</em> --
 the Lords or Creators of Being. In Vishnu Purana, <em>Parasara
 </em>says of him, "in every Kalpa (or manvantara) Daksha
 and the rest are born and are again destroyed." And the Rig-Veda
 says that "Daksha sprang from Aditi and Aditi from Daksha,"
 a reference to the eternal cyclic re-birth of the same divine
 Essence.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 248 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 Rishis, Kumaras,* etc. etc., are said to incarnate personally
 in the Third Root-Race and thus find themselves "reborn over
 and over again." In the Esoteric doctrine they are generally
 named the Asuras, or the <em>Asu-ra Devata </em>or <em>Pitar-devata
 </em>(gods) for, as said, they were first Gods -- and the highest
 -- before they became "<em>no</em>-gods," and had from
 Spirits of Heaven fallen into Spirits of the Earth** <em>-- exoterically,
 </em>note well, in orthodox dogma.
 </p><p>
 No Theologian, any more than an Orientalist, can ever understand
 the genealogies of the Prajapati, the Manus, and the Rishis, nor
 the direct connection of these -- or their correlation rather
 -- with the Gods, unless he has the key to the old primitive Cosmogony
 and Theogony, which all the Nations originally had in common.
 All these gods and demi-gods are found reborn on earth, in various
 Kalpas and in as various characters; each, moreover, <em>having
 his Karma distinctly traced, and every effect assigned to its
 cause.</em> 
 </p><p>
 Before other Stanzas could be explained, it was, as seen, absolutely
 necessary to show that the sons of "Dark Wisdom," though
 identical with the Archangels which Theology has chosen to call
 the "Fallen," are as divine and as pure and more so
 than all the Michaels and Gabriels so glorified in the churches.
 The "old Book" goes into various details of Astral life,
 which at this juncture would be quite incomprehensible to the
 reader. It may, therefore, be left for later explanations, and
 the First and Second Races can now only receive bare notice. Not
 so for the Third Race -- the Root-Race which separated into sexes,
 and which was the first to be endowed with reason. Men evolving
 <em>pari passu </em>with the globe, and the latter having "incrustated"
 more than a hundred million of years before -- the first human
 sub-race had already begun to materialize or solidify, so to say.
 But, as the <em>Stanza </em>has it: "<em>the inner man </em>(the
 conscious Entity) <em>was not.</em>"<em> </em>This "Conscious
 Entity" Occultism says, comes from, nay, in many cases <em>is,
 </em>the very entire essence and <em>esse </em>of the high Intelligences
 condemned, by the undeviating law of Karmic evolution, to reincarnate
 in this manvantara.

 * No one of these orders is distinct from the Pitris or Progenitors,
 as says Manu (iii. 284). "The wise call our fathers Vasus;
 our paternal grandfathers, Rudras; our paternal great grandfathers,
 Adityas; agreeably to a text of the Vedas," or "this
 is an everlasting Vedic text" in another translation.

 of Earth. Below these again various classes of Spirits and "Genii"

 <p>
 (<em>b</em>) This verse (thirty-ninth) relates exclusively to
 the racial divisions. Strictly speaking, esoteric philosophy teaches
 a modified polygenesis. For, while it assigns to humanity a oneness
 of origin, in so far that its forefathers or "Creators"
 were all divine beings -- though of different classes or degrees
 of perfection in their hierarchy -- men were nevertheless born
 on seven different centres of the continent of that period. Though
 all of one common origin, yet for reasons given their potentialities
 and mental capabilities, outward or physical forms, and future
 characteristics, were very different.* As to their complexions,
 there is a suggestive allegory told in <em>Linga Purana. </em>The
 <em>Kumdra</em> -- the Rudra gods, so called (<em>see</em> <em>further</em>),<em>
 </em>are described as incarnations of Siva, the <em>destroyer
 </em>(of<em> outward forms</em>), named also Vamadeva. The latter,
 as a <em>Kumara, </em>the "Eternal Celibate," the chaste
 Virgin youth, springs from Brahma in each great Manvantara, and
 "again becomes four"; a reference to the <em>four great
 divisions of </em>the human races, as regards complexion and type
 -- and three chief variations of these. Thus in the 29th Kalpa
 -- in this case a reference to the transformation and evolution
 of the human form which Siva ever destroys and remodels periodically,
 down to the manvantaric great turning point about the middle of
 the Fourth (Atlantean) Race -- in the 29th Kalpa, Siva, as Swetalohita,
 the <em>root</em> Kumara, becomes, from moon-coloured, <em>white</em>;
 in his next transformation -- he is <em>red </em>(and in this
 the exoteric version differs from the Esoteric teaching); in the
 third <em>-- yellow</em>;<em> </em>in the fourth -- <em>black.</em>
 
 </p><p>
 Esotericism now classes these seven variations, with their four
 great divisions, into only<em> three </em>distinct primeval races
 -- as it does not take into consideration the First Race, which
 had neither type nor colour, and hardly an objective, though colossal
 form. The evolution of these races, their formation and development,
 went <em>pari passu </em>and on parallel lines with the evolution,
 formation, and development of three geological strata, from which
 the human complexion was as much derived as it was determined
 by the climates of those zones. It names three great divisions,
 namely, the RED-YELLOW, the BLACK, and the BROWN-WHITE.** The
 Aryan races, for instance, now varying from dark brown, almost
 black, red-brown-yellow, down to the whitest creamy colour, are
 yet all of one and the same stock -- the Fifth Root-Race -- and
 spring

 <p>
 * Some superior, others inferior, <em>to suit the Karma </em>of
 the various reincarnating Monads which could not be all of the
 same degree of purity in their last births in other worlds. This
 accounts for the difference of races, the inferiority of the savage,
 and other human varieties.
 </p><p>
 ** "There are," says Topinard (English edition of "Anthropology,"
 with preface by Professor Broca), "THREE fundamental elements
 of colour in the human organism -- namely, the <em>red</em>, <em>the
 yellow, </em>and the <em>black, </em>which, mixed in variable
 quantities with the white of the tissues, give rise to those numerous
 shades seen in the human family." Here is science unintentionally
 supporting Occultism again.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 250 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 from one single progenitor, called in Hindu <em>exotericism </em>by
 the generic name of Vaivasvata Manu: the latter, remember, being
 that generic personage, the Sage, who is said to have lived over
 18,000,000 years ago, and also 850,000 years ago -- at the time
 of the sinking of the last remnants of the great continent of
 Atlantis* (<em>See the Root and Seed Manus </em>further on), and
 who is said to live even <em>now </em>in his mankind. (<em>Vide
 at the end of this Stanza, </em>"<strong>T</strong>HE <strong>P</strong>RIMEVAL
 <strong>M</strong>ANUS OF <strong>H</strong>UMANITY.") The
 light yellow is the colour of the first SOLID human race, which
 appeared after the middle of the Third Root Race (<em>after its
 fall </em>into generation -- as just explained), bringing on the
 final changes. For, it is only at that period that the last transformation
 took place, which brought forth man as he is now, only on a magnified
 scale. This Race gave birth to the Fourth Race; "Siva"
 gradually transforming that portion of Humanity which became "black
 with sin" into <em>red-yellow </em>(the red Indians and the
 Mongolians being the descendants of these) and finally into Brown-white
 races -- which now, together with the yellow Races, form the great
 bulk of Humanity. The allegory in <em>Linga Purana </em>is curious,
 as showing the great ethnological knowledge of the ancients.
 </p><p>
 When reading of "the last transformation," let the reader
 consider at this juncture, if that took place 18,000,000 years
 ago, how many millions more it must have required to reach that
 final stage? And if man, in his gradual consolidation, developed
 <em>pari passu </em>with the earth, how many millions of years
 must have elapsed during the <em>First, Second, </em>and the first
 half of the <em>Third </em>Race? For the Earth was in a comparatively
 ethereal condition before it reached its last consolidated state;
 the archaic teachings, moreover, telling us that, during the middle
 period of the Lemuro-Atlantean Race, three and a half Races after
 the Genesis of man, the Earth, man, and everything on the Globe
 was of a still grosser and more material nature, while such things
 as corals and some shells were still in a semi-gelatinous, astral
 state. The cycles that intervened since then, have already carried
 us onward, on the opposite ascending arc, some steps toward our
 <em>dematerialization, </em>as the spiritualists would say. The
 Earth, ourselves, and all things have softened since then -- aye,
 even our brains. But it has been objected by some theosophists
 that an ethereal Earth even some 15, or 20,000,000 years ago,
 <em>does not square with Geology, </em>which teaches us that winds
 blew, rains fell, waves broke on the shore, sands shifted and
 accumulated,

 <p>
 * It must be remembered that the "last remnants" here
 spoken of, refer to those portions of the "great continent"
 which still remained, and not to any of the numerous islands which
 existed contemporaneously with the continent. Plato's "island"
 was, for instance, one of such remnants; the others having sunk
 at various periods previously. An occult "tradition"
 teaches that such submersions occur whenever there is an eclipse
 of the "spiritual sun."</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 251 ANSWERS TO OBJECTIONS.</h6>
 
 <p>
 etc., etc., that, in short, all natural causes now in operation
 were then in force, "<em>in the very earliest ages of geological
 time, </em>aye, that of the oldest palaeozoic rocks." To
 this the following answers are given. <em>Firstly, </em>what is
 the date assigned by geology to those "oldest palaezoic rocks"?
 And<em> secondly, </em>why could not the winds blow, rain fall,
 and waves (of <em>carbonic acid </em>apparently, as science seems
 to imply) break on the shore, on an Earth semi-astral, <em>i.e</em>.,
 viscid? The word "astral" does not necessarily mean
 as thin as smoke, in occult phraseology, but rather "starry,"
 shining or pellucid, in various and numerous degrees, from a quite
 filmy to a viscid state, as just observed. But it is further objected:
 How could an astral <em>Earth </em>have affected the other planets
 in this system? Would not the whole process get out of gear now
 if the attraction of one planet was suddenly removed? The objection
 is evidently invalid, since our system is composed of older and
 younger planets, some dead (like the moon), others in process
 of formation, for all astronomy knows to the contrary. Nor has
 the latter ever affirmed, so far as we know, that all the bodies
 of our system have sprung into existence and developed simultaneously.
 The Cis-Himalayan secret teachings differ from those of India
 in this respect. Hindu Occultism teaches that the Vaivasvata Manu
 Humanity is eighteen million and odd years old. We say, yes; but
 only so far as <em>physical, </em>or approximately physical, man
 is concerned, who dates from the close of the Third Root-Race.
 Beyond that period MAN, or his filmy image, may have existed for
 300 million years, for all we know; <em>since we are not taught
 figures </em>which are and will remain secret with the Masters
 of Occult Science, as justly stated in "Esoteric Buddhism."
 Moreover, whereas the Hindu Puranas speak of one Vaivasvata Manu,
 we affirm that there were several, the name being a generic one.
