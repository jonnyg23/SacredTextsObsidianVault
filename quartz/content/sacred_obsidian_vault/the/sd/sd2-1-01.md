 In primeval times, a maiden,<br>
 Beauteous Daughter of the Ether,<br>
 Passed for ages her existence<br>
 In the great expanse of Heaven,
 </p><p>
 . . . . . . . . . . .
 </p><p>
 Seven hundred years she wandered,<br>
 Seven hundred years she laboured,<br>
 Ere her first-born was delivered.
 </p><p>
 . . . . . . . . . . .
 </p><p>
 Ere a beauteous duck descending,<br>
 Hastens toward the water-mother.
 </p><p>
 . . . . . . . . . . .
 </p><p>
 Lightly on the knee she settles,<br>
 Finds a nesting-place befitting,<br>
 Where to lay her eggs in safety,<br>
 Lays her eggs within, at pleasure,<br>
 <em>Six, </em>the golden eggs she lays them,<br>
 Then a <em>Seventh, </em>an egg of iron . . . . ."

 <strong>S</strong>HE LAY ON HER BACK; ON HER SIDE . . . <strong>S</strong>HE
 WOULD CALL NO SONS OF <strong>H</strong>EAVEN, SHE WOULD ASK NO
 SONS OF <strong>W</strong>ISDOM. <strong>S</strong>HE CREATED
 FROM HER OWN BOSOM. <strong>S</strong>HE EVOLVED WATER-MEN, TERRIBLE
 AND BAD.
 </p><p>
 6. <strong>T</strong>HE WATER-MEN TERRIBLE AND BAD SHE HERSELF
 CREATED FROM THE REMAINS OF OTHERS, FROM THE DROSS AND SLIME OF
 HER FIRST, SECOND, AND THIRD, SHE FORMED THEM. <strong>T</strong>HE
 <strong>D</strong>HYANI CAME AND LOOKED -- <strong>T</strong>HE
 <strong>D</strong>HYANI FROM THE BRIGHT <strong>F</strong>ATHER-MOTHER,
 FROM THE WHITE REGIONS THEY CAME, FROM THE ABODES OF THE IMMORTAL
 MORTALS.
 </p><p>
 7. <strong>D</strong>ISPLEASED THEY WERE. <strong>O</strong>UR
 FLESH IS NOT THERE. <strong>N</strong>O FIT RUPAS FOR OUR BROTHERS

 THEM.
 </p><p>
 8. <strong>T</strong>HE FLAMES CAME. <strong>T</strong>HE FIRES
 WITH THE SPARKS; THE NIGHT FIRES AND THE DAY FIRES. <strong>T</strong>HEY
 DRIED OUT THE TURBID DARK WATERS. <strong>W</strong>ITH THEIR
 HEAT THEY QUENCHED THEM. <strong>T</strong>HE <strong>L</strong>HAS

 </p><p>
 12. <strong>T</strong>HE GREAT <strong>C</strong>HOHANS CALLED
 THE <strong>L</strong>ORDS OF THE <strong>M</strong>OON, OF THE

 NATURE. <strong>G</strong>IVE THEM THEIR FORMS WITHIN. <strong>S</strong>HE
 WILL BUILD COVERINGS WITHOUT. <strong>M</strong>ALES-FEMALES WILL
 THEY BE. <strong>L</strong>ORDS OF THE <strong>F</strong>LAME
 ALSO . . . . "

 </p><p>
 15. <strong>S</strong>EVEN TIMES SEVEN <strong>S</strong>HADOWS
 OF FUTURE MEN WERE BORN, EACH OF HIS OWN COLOUR AND KIND. <strong>E</strong>ACH
 INFERIOR TO HIS FATHER. <strong>T</strong>HE FATHERS, THE BONELESS,
 COULD GIVE NO LIFE TO BEINGS WITH BONES. <strong>T</strong>HEIR
 PROGENY WERE <strong>B</strong>HUTA, WITH NEITHER FORM NOR MIND.
 <strong>T</strong>HEREFORE THEY ARE CALLED THE <strong>C</strong>HHAYA.
 </p><p>
 16. <strong>H</strong>OW ARE THE <strong>M</strong>ANUSHYA BORN?
 <strong>T</strong>HE <strong>M</strong>ANUS WITH MINDS, HOW ARE
 THEY MADE? <strong>T</strong>HE FATHERS CALLED TO THEIR HELP THEIR
 OWN FIRE; WHICH IS THE FIRE THAT BURNS IN <strong>E</strong>ARTH.
 <strong>T</strong>HE <strong>S</strong>PIRIT OF THE <strong>E</strong>ARTH
 CALLED TO HIS HELP THE <strong>S</strong>OLAR <strong>F</strong>IRE.
 <strong>T</strong>HESE THREE PRODUCED IN THEIR JOINT EFFORTS A
 GOOD <strong>R</strong>UPA. <strong>I</strong>T COULD STAND, WALK,
 RUN, RECLINE, OR FLY. <strong>Y</strong>ET IT WAS STILL BUT A
 <strong>C</strong>HHAYA, A SHADOW WITH NO SENSE . . . .
 </p><p>
 17. <strong>T</strong>HE BREATH NEEDED A FORM; <strong>T</strong>HE
 <strong>F</strong>ATHERS GAVE IT. <strong>T</strong>HE BREATH
 NEEDED A GROSS BODY; THE <strong>E</strong>ARTH MOULDED IT. <strong>T</strong>HE
 BREATH NEEDED THE <strong>S</strong>PIRIT OF <strong>L</strong>IFE;
 THE <strong>S</strong>OLAR <strong>L</strong>HAS BREATHED IT INTO
 ITS FORM. <strong>T</strong>HE BREATH NEEDED A <strong>M</strong>IRROR
 OF ITS <strong>B</strong>ODY; "<strong>W</strong>E GAVE IT
 OUR OWN," SAID THE <strong>D</strong>HYANIS. <strong>T</strong>HE
 <strong>B</strong>REATH NEEDED A <strong>V</strong>EHICLE OF <strong>D</strong>ESIRES;
 "<strong>I</strong>T HAS IT," SAID THE <strong>D</strong>RAINER
 OF <strong>W</strong>ATERS. <strong>B</strong>UT <strong>B</strong>REATH
 NEEDS A MIND TO EMBRACE THE <strong>U</strong>NIVERSE; "<strong>W</strong>E
 CANNOT GIVE THAT," SAID THE <strong>F</strong>ATHERS. "<strong>I</strong>
 NEVER HAD IT," SAID THE <strong>S</strong>PIRIT OF THE <strong>E</strong>ARTH.
 "<strong>T</strong>HE FORM WOULD BE CONSUMED WERE I TO GIVE
 IT MINE," SAID THE <strong>G</strong>REAT <strong>F</strong>IRE
 . . . . <strong>M</strong>AN REMAINED AN EMPTY SENSELESS <strong>B</strong>HUTA

 THE DROPS BECAME HARD AND ROUND. <strong>T</strong>HE <strong>S</strong>UN
 WARMED IT; THE <strong>M</strong>OON COOLED AND SHAPED IT; THE
 WIND FED IT UNTIL ITS RIPENESS. <strong>T</strong>HE WHITE SWAN
 FROM THE STARRY VAULT OVERSHADOWED THE BIG DROP. <strong>T</strong>HE
