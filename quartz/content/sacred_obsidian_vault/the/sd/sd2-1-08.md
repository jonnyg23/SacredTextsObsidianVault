 This Stanza contains, in itself, the whole key to the mysteries
 of evil, the so-called Fall of the angels, and the many problems
 that have puzzled the brains of the philosophers from the time
 that the memory of man began. It solves the secret of the subsequent
 inequalities of intellectual capacity, of birth or social position,
 and gives a logical explanation to the incomprehensible Karmic
 course throughout the aeons which followed. The best explanation
 which can be given, in view of the difficulties of the subject,
 shall now be attempted.
 </p><p>
 (<em>a</em>)<em> </em>Up to the Fourth Round, and even to the
 later part of the Third Race in this Round, <em>Man -- </em>if
 the ever-changing forms that clothed the Monads during the first
 three Rounds and the first two and a half races of the present
 one can be given that misleading name -- is, so far, only an animal
 intellectually. It is only in the actual <em>midway </em>Round
 that he develops in himself entirely the fourth principle as a
 fit vehicle for the</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 162 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 fifth. But Manas will be relatively <em>fully</em> developed only
 in the following Round, when it will have an opportunity of becoming
 entirely divine until the end of the Rounds. As Christian Schoettgen
 says in <em>Horae Hebraic, </em>etc., the first terrestrial Adam
 "had only the breath of life," <em>Nephesh, but not
 the living Soul.</em> 
 </p><p>
 (<em>b</em>) Here the <em>inferior </em>Races, of which there
 are still some analogues left -- as the Australians (now fast
 dying out) and some African and Oceanic tribes -- are meant. "<em>They
 were not ready</em>" signifies that the <em>Karmic </em>development
 of these Monads had not yet fitted them to occupy the forms of
 men destined for incarnation in higher intellectual Races. But
 this is explained later on.
 </p><p>
 (<em>c</em>) <em>The Zohar </em>speaks of "Black Fire,"
 which is <em>Absolute </em>Light-Wisdom. To those who, prompted
 by old theological prejudice, may say: "But the <em>Asuras
 </em>are the rebel Devas, the <em>opponents of the Gods -- </em>hence
 devils, and the spirits of Evil," it is answered: Esoteric
 philosophy admits neither good nor evil <em>per se, </em>as existing
 independently in nature. The cause for both is found, as regards
 the Kosmos, in the necessity of contraries or contrasts, and with
 respect to man, in his human nature, his ignorance and passions.
 There is no <em>devil </em>or the utterly depraved, as there are
 no Angels absolutely perfect, though there may be spirits of Light
 and of Darkness; thus <strong>L</strong>UCIFER -- the spirit of
 Intellectual Enlightenment and Freedom of Thought -- is metaphorically
 the guiding beacon, which helps man to find his way through the
 rocks and sandbanks of Life, for Lucifer is the <strong>L</strong>OGOS
 in his highest, and the "Adversary" in his lowest aspect
 -- both of which are reflected in our <em>Ego. </em>Lactantius,
 speaking of the Nature of Christ, makes the <strong>L</strong>OGOS,
 the <em>Word, the first-born brother of Satan, </em>the "<em>first
 of all creatures.</em>"<em> </em>(<em>Inst. div</em>. Book
 II., c. viii., "Qabbalah," 116.)
 </p><p>
 The<em> Vishnu Purana </em>describes these primeval creatures
 (the <em>Arvaksrota</em>) with<em> crooked </em>digestive canals:
 They were "endowed with inward manifestations, but mutually
 in ignorance about <em>their kind and nature.</em>" The twenty-eight
 kinds of <em>Badha, </em>or imperfections, do not apply, as Wilson
 thought, to the animals now known and specified by him,* for these
 did not exist in those geological periods. This is quite plain
 in the said work, in which the first created (on this globe) are
 the "five-fold immovable creation," minerals and vegetables;
 then come those fabulous animals, <em>Tiryaksrota, </em>(the monsters
 of the abyss slain by the "Lords," see Stanzas <b>II.
 </b>and <b>III</b>.); then the <em>Urdhwasrotas, </em>the happy
 celestial beings, which feed on ambrosia; then lastly, the <em>Arvaksrotas,
 </em>human beings -- Brahma's

 <p>
 seventh creation so-called. But these "creations," including
 the latter, did not occur on this globe, wherever else they may
 have taken place. It is not Brahma who creates things and men
 on this Earth, but the chief and Lord of the Prajapati, the Lords
 of Being and terrestrial Creation.* Obeying the command of Brahma,
 Daksha (the synthesis, or the aggregate, of the terrestrial creators
 and progenitors, Pitris included) made superior and inferior (<em>vara
 </em>and<em> avara</em>)<em> </em>things "referring to <em>putra</em>"
 progeny, and "<em>bipeds </em>and<em> quadrupeds, </em>and
 subsequently by his will (the Sons of Will and Yoga) made females,"
 <em>i.e</em>., separated the androgynes. Here again, we have "bipeds"
 or men, created before the "quadrupeds" as in the esoteric
 teachings. (<em>Vide supra and Stanza XII as explained.</em>)
 </p><p>
 Since, in the exoteric accounts, the <em>Asuras </em>are the first
 beings created from the "body of night," while the <em>Pitris
 </em>issue from that of <em>Twilight</em>;<em> </em>the "gods"
 being placed by Parasara<em> </em>(<em>Vishnu Purana</em>)<em>
 </em>between the two, and shown to evolve from the "body
 of the day," it is easy to discover a determined purpose
 to veil the order of creation. Man is the <em>Arvaksrota </em>coming
 from the "Body of the Dawn"; and elsewhere, man is again
 referred to, when the creator of the world, Brahma, is shown "creating
 fierce beings, denominated Bhutas and eaters of flesh," or
 as the text has it, "fiends frightful from being monkey-coloured
 and carnivorous."** Whereas the Rakshasas are generally translated
 by "Evil Spirits" and "the enemies of the gods,"
 which identifies them with the <em>Asuras. </em>In the Ramayana,
 when Hanuman is reconnoitering the enemy in Lanka, he finds there
 Rakshasas, some hideous, "while some were beautiful to look
 upon," and, in <em>Vishnu Purana, </em>there is a direct
 reference to their becoming the Saviours of "Humanity,"
 or of Brahma.
 </p><p>
 The allegory is very ingenious. Great intellect and too much knowledge
 are a two-edged weapon in life, and instruments for evil as well
 as for good. When combined with Selfishness, they will make of
 the whole of Humanity a footstool for the elevation of him who
 possesses them, and a means for the attainment of his objects;
 while, applied to altruistic humanitarian purposes, they may become
 the means of the salvation of many. At all events, the absence
 of self-consciousness and intellect will make of man an idiot,
 a brute in human form. Brahma is <em>Mahat -- </em>the universal
 Mind -- hence the too-selfish among the Rakshasas showing the
 desire to become possessed of it all -- to "devour"
 Mahat. The allegory is transparent.
 </p><p>
 At any rate, esoteric philosophy identifies the pre-Brahmanical

 Asuras, Rudras,* Rakshasas and all the "Adversaries"
 of the Gods in the allegories, with the Egos, which, by incarnating
 in the still witless man of the Third Race, made him <em>consciously
 </em>immortal. They are, then, during the cycle of Incarnations,
 the true <em>dual Logos -- </em>the conflicting and two-faced
 divine Principle in Man. The Commentary that follows, and the
 next Stanzas may, no doubt, throw more light on this very difficult
 tenet, but the writer does not feel competent to give it out fully.
 Of the succession of Races, however, they say: --
 </p><p>
 "<em>First come the SELF-EXISTENT on this Earth. They are
 the </em>'<em>Spiritual Lives</em>'<em> projected by the absolute
 WILL and</em> <em>LAW, at the dawn of every rebirth of the worlds.
 These LIVES are the divine </em>'<em>Sishta,</em>'<em> </em>(the
 seed-Manus, or the Prajapati and the Pitris)."
 </p><p>
 From these proceed --
 </p><p>
 1.<em> The First Race, the </em>"<em>Self-born,</em>"<em>
 which are the </em>(astral)<em> shadows of their Progenitors.</em>**<em>
 The body was devoid of all understanding </em>(mind, intelligence,
 and will). <em>The inner being </em>(the higher self or Monad),
 <em>though within the earthly frame, was unconnected with it.
 The link, the Manas, was not there as yet.</em> 
 </p><p>
 2.<em> From the First </em>(race)<em> emanated the second, called
 the </em>"<em>Sweat-born</em>"***<em> and</em>

 <p>
 * Whom Manu calls "our paternal grandfathers" (<b>III.</b>,
 284). The Rudras are the seven manifestations of Rudra-Siva, "the
 destroying god," and <em>also </em>the grand Yogi and ascetic.
 </p><p>
 ** See § II, §§ 1, Commentary.
 </p><p>
 *** To speak of <em>life </em>as having arisen, and of the human
 race as having originated, in this <em>absurdly unscientific </em>way,
 in the face of the modern Pedigrees of Man, is to court instantaneous
 annihilation. The esoteric doctrine risks the danger, nevertheless,
 and even goes so far as to ask the impartial reader to compare
 the above hypothesis (if it is one) with Haeckel's theory -- now
 fast becoming an axiom with science -- which is quoted verbatim:
 --
 </p><p>
 ". . . How did life, the living world of organisms, arise?
 And, secondly, the special question: How did the human race originate?
 The first of these two inquiries, that as to the first appearance
 of living beings, can only be decided empirically (! !) by proof
 of the so-called Archebiosis, or equivocal generation, or the
 spontaneous production of organisms of the simplest conceivable
 kind. Such are the Monera (Protogenes, Protamoeba, etc), exceedingly
 simple microscopic masses of protoplasm without structure or organisation,
 which take in nutriment and <em>reproduce themselves by division.
 </em>Such a Moneron as that primordial organism <em>discovered
 </em>by the renowned English zoologist Huxley, and named Bathybius
 Haeckelii, appears as a continuous thick protoplasmic covering
 at the greatest depths of the ocean, between 3,000 and 30,000
 feet. <em>It is true that the first appearance of such Monera
 has not up to the present moment been actually observed</em>;<em>
 </em>but there is nothing intrinsically improbable in such an
 evolution." (<em>The </em>"<em>Pedigree of Man,</em>"<em>
 Aveling</em>'<em>s translation, p </em>33.)
 </p><p>
 The Bathybius protoplasm having recently turned out to be no organic
 substance at all, there remains little to be said. Nor, after
 reading this, does one need to consume further time in refuting
 the further assertion that . . . . "in that case man also
 [[Footnote continued on next page]] </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 165 TO THE MONERON THE CREATOR.</h6>
 
 <p>
 <em>the </em>"<em>Boneless.</em>"<em> This is the Second
 Root-Race, endowed by the preservers </em>(Rakshasas)* <em>and
 the incarnating gods </em>(Asuras and the Kumaras) <em>with the
 first primitive and weak spark </em>(the germ of intelligence)
 . . <em>And from these in turn proceeds: -</em>-
 </p><p>
 3. <em>The Third Root-Race, the </em>"<em>Two-fold</em>"<em>
 </em>(Androgynes). <em>The first Races hereof are shells, till
 the last is </em>"<em>inhabited</em>"<em> </em>(i.e.,
 informed) <em>by the Dhyanis.</em> 
 </p><p>
 The Second Race, as stated above, being also sexless, evolved
 out of itself, at its beginning, the Third Androgyne Race by an
 analogous, but already more complicated process. As described
 in the <em>Commentary,</em> the very earliest of that race were:
 --

 "<em>The </em>'<em>Sons of Passive Yoga.* They issued from
 the second Manushyas</em> 
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------

 <p>
 [[Footnote continued from previous page]] has <em>beyond a doubt
 </em>(to the minds of Haeckel and his like) arisen from the lower
 mammalia, apes and the earlier simian creatures, the still earlier
 Marsupialia, Amphibia, Pisces, by progressive transformations,"
 all produced by "a series of <em>natural forces working blindly</em>.
 . . . . . . . . <em>aim, without design</em>" (<em>p. </em>36).
 </p><p>
 The above-quoted passage bears its criticism on its own face.
 Science is made to teach that which, up to the present time, "<em>has
 never been actually observed.</em>"<em> </em>She is made
 to deny the phenomenon of an <em>intelligent</em> nature and a
 vital force independent of form and matter, and to find it more
 scientific to teach the miraculous performance of "natural
 forces <em>working blindly without aim or design.</em>"<em>
 </em>If so, then we are led to think that the <em>physico-mechanical
 </em>forces of the brains of certain eminent Scientists are leading
 them on as blindly to sacrifice logic and common sense on the
 altar of mutual admiration. Why should the protoplasmic <em>Moneron</em>
 producing the first living creature through <em>self-division
 </em>be held as a very scientific hypothesis, and an ethereal
 <em>pre-human </em>race generating the primeval men in the same
 fashion be tabooed as <em>unscientific </em>superstition? Or has
 materialism obtained a sole monopoly in Science?
 </p><p>
 * The<em> Rakshasas, </em>regarded in Indian popular theology
 as demons, are called the "Preservers" beyond the Himalayas.
 This double and contradictory meaning has its origin in a philosophical
 allegory, which is variously rendered in the Puranas. It is stated
 that when Brahma created the demons, Yakshas (from <em>Yaksh,
 </em>to eat) and the Rakshasas, both of which kinds of demons,
 as soon as born, wished to devour their creator, those among them
 that called out "Not so! oh, let him be saved (preserved)"
 were named Rakshasas (<em>Vishnu Purana Book I. ch. v</em>.).
 The <em>Bhagavata Purana</em> (<em>III, </em>20, 19-21) renders
 the allegory differently. Brahma transformed himself into night
 (or ignorance) invested with a body, upon which the Yakshas and
 Rakshasas seized, exclaiming "Do not spare it; devour it."
 Brahma then cried out, "Do not devour me, spare me."
 This has an inner meaning of course. The "body of Night"
 is the darkness of ignorance, and it is the darkness of silence
 and secrecy. Now the Rakshasas are shown in almost every case
 to be Yogis, pious Saddhus and Initiates, a rather unusual occupation
 for <em>demons. </em>The meaning then is that while we have power
 to dispel the darkness of ignorance, "<em>devour it,</em>"<em>
 </em>we have to preserve the sacred truth from profanation. "Brahma
 is for the Brahmins alone," says that proud caste. The moral
 of the <em>fable </em>is evident.
 </p><p>
 ** The gradual evolution of man in the Secret Doctrine shows that
 all the later (to the profane the earliest) Races have their <em>physical
 </em>origin in the early Fourth Race. But it is the sub-race,
 which preceded the one that separated sexually, that is to be

 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 166 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 (human race), <em>and became oviparous. The emanations that came
 out of their bodies during the seasons of procreation were ovulary</em>;<em>
 the small spheroidal nuclei developing into a large soft, egg-like
 vehicle, gradually hardened, when, after a period of gestation,
 it broke and the young human animal issued from it unaided, as
 the fowls do in our race.</em>"
 </p><p>
 This must seem to the reader ludicrously absurd. Nevertheless,
 it is strictly on the lines of evolutionary analogy, which science
 perceives in the development of the living animal species. First
 the <em>moneron-</em>like<em> </em>procreation by self-division
 (<em>vide Haeckel</em>);<em> </em>then, after a few stages, the
 oviparous, as in the case of the reptiles, which are followed
 by the birds; then, finally, the mammals with their <em>ovoviviparous
 </em>modes of producing their young ones.
 </p><p>
 If the term <em>ovoviviparous </em>is applied to some fish and
 reptiles, which hatch their eggs within their bodies, why should
 it not be applied to female mammalians, including woman? The ovule,
 in which, after impregnation, the development of the foetus takes
 place, is an egg.
 </p><p>
 At all events, this conception is more philosophical than that
 of Eve with a suddenly created placenta giving birth to Cain,
 because of the Apple, when even the marsupial, the earliest of
 mammals, <em>is not placental </em>yet.
 </p><p>
 Moreover, the <em>progressive </em>order of the methods of reproduction,
 as unveiled by science, is a brilliant confirmation of esoteric
 Ethnology. It is only necessary to tabulate the data in order
 to prove our assertion. (Cf.<em> especially Schmidt</em>'<em>s
 </em>"<em>Doctrine of Descent and Darwinism,</em>" <em>p.
 </em>39, <em>et. seq., and Laing</em>'<em>s </em>"<em>A Modern
 Zoroastrian,</em>" <em>pp. </em>102-111.)I

 We now come to an important point with regard to the double evolution
 of the human race. The Sons of Wisdom, or the <em>spiritual </em>Dhyanis,
 had become "intellectual" through their contact with
 matter, because they had already reached, during previous cycles
 of incarnation, that degree of intellect which enabled them to
 become independent and self-conscious entities, <em>on this plane
 </em>of matter. They were reborn only by reason of Karmic effects.
 They <em>entered </em>those who were "ready," and became
 the Arhats, or <em>sages, </em>alluded to above. This needs explanation.
 </p><p>
 It does not mean that <em>Monads </em>entered forms in which other
 Monads already were. They were "Essences," "Intelligences,"
 and <em>conscious spirits</em>;<em> </em>entities seeking to become
 still more conscious by uniting with more developed matter. Their
 essence was too pure to be distinct from the universal essence;
 but their "Egos," or <em>Manas</em> (since they are
 called<em> Manasaputra, </em>born of "Mahat," or Brahma)
 had to pass through earthly human experiences to become <em>all-wise,
 </em>and be able to start on the returning ascending cycle. The
 <em>Monads </em>are not <em>discrete </em>principles, limited
 or conditioned, but rays from that one universal <em>absolute
 </em>Principle. The entrance into a dark room through the same
 aperture of one ray of sunlight following another will not constitute
 <em>two</em> rays, but one ray intensified. It is not in the course
 of natural law that man should become a <em>perfect </em>septenary
 being, before the seventh race in the seventh Round. Yet he has
 all these principles latent in him from his birth. Nor is it part
 of the evolutionary law that the Fifth principle (<em>Manas</em>),
 should receive its complete development before the <em>Fifth </em>Round.
 All such prematurely developed intellects (on the <em>spiritual
 </em>plane) in our Race are <em>abnormal</em>;<em> </em>they are
 those whom we call the "Fifth-Rounders." Even in the
 coming seventh Race, at the close of this Fourth Round, while
 our four lower principles will be fully developed, that of <em>Manas
 </em>will be only proportionately so. This limitation, however,
 refers solely to the spiritual development. The intellectual,
 on the physical plane, was reached during the Fourth Root-Race.
 Thus, those who were "half ready," who received "but
 a spark," constitute the average humanity which has to acquire
 its intellectuality during the present Manvantaric evolution,
 </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 168 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 after which they will be ready in the next for the full reception
 of the "Sons of Wisdom." While those which "were
 not ready" at all, the latest Monads, which had hardly evolved
 from their last transitional and lower animal forms at the close
 of the Third Round, remained the "narrow-brained" of
 the Stanza. This explains the otherwise unaccountable degrees
 of intellectuality among the various races of men -- the savage
 Bushman and the European -- even now. Those tribes of savages,
 whose reasoning powers are very little above the level of the
 animals, are not the unjustly disinherited, or the <em>unfavoured,
 </em>as some may think -- nothing of the kind. They are simply
 those <em>latest arrivals </em>among the human Monads, which <em>were</em>
 <em>not ready: </em>which have to evolve during the present Round,
 as on the three remaining globes (hence on four different planes
 of being) so as to arrive at the level of the average class when
 they reach the Fifth Round. One remark may prove useful, as food
 for thought to the student in this connection. The MONADS of the
 lowest specimens of humanity (the "narrow-brained"*
 savage South-Sea Islander, the African, the Australian) <em>had
 no Karma to work out when first born as men, as their more favoured
 brethren in intelligence had. </em>The former are spinning out
 Karma only now; the latter are burdened with past, present, and
 future Karma. In this respect the poor savage is more fortunate
 than the greatest genius of <em>civilised countries.</em> 
 </p><p>
 Let us pause before giving any more such strange teachings. Let
 us try and find out how far any ancient Scriptures, and even Science,
 permit the possibility of, or even distinctly corroborate, such
 wild notions as are found in our Anthropogenesis.
 </p><p>
 Recapitulating that which has been said we find: -- That the Secret
 Doctrine claims for man, (1) a polygenetic origin. (2) A variety
 of modes of procreation before humanity fell into the ordinary
 method of generation. (3) That the evolution of animals -- of
 the mammalians at any rate -- follows that of man instead of preceding
 it. And this is diametrically opposed to the now generally accepted
 theories of evolution and the descent of man from an animal ancestor.

 * The term here means neither the dolicho-cephalic nor the brachyo-cephalic,
 nor yet skulls of a smaller volume, but simply brains devoid of
 intellect generally. The theory which would judge of the intellectual
 capacity of a man according to his cranial capacity, seems absurdly
 illogical to one who has studied the subject. The skulls of the
 stone period, as well as those of African Races (Bushmen included)
 show that the first are above rather than below the average of
 the brain capacity of the modern man, and the skulls of the last
 are on the whole (as in the case of Papuans and Polynesians generally)
 larger by one cubic inch than that of the average Frenchman. Again,
 the cranial capacity of the Parisian of to-day represents an average
 of 1437 cubic centimetres compared to 1523 of the Auvergnat.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 169 MONOGENISM OR POLYGENISM.</h6>
 
 <p>
 Let us, by giving to Caesar what is Caesar's, examine, first of
 all, the chances for the polygenetic theory among the men of science.
 </p><p>
 Now the majority of the Darwinian evolutionists incline to a polygenetic
 explanation of the origin of Races. On this particular question,
 however, scientists are, as in many other cases, at sixes and
 sevens; they agree to disagree.
 </p><p>
 "Does man descend from one <em>single couple </em>or from
 <em>several groups -- </em>monogenism or polygenism? As far as
 one can venture to pronounce on what in the absence of witnesses
 (?) will never be known (?), the second hypothesis is far the
 most probable."* Abel Hovelacque, in his "Science of
 Language," comes to a similar conclusion, arguing from the
 evidence available to a linguistic enquirer.
 </p><p>
 In an address delivered before the British Association, Professor
 W. H. Flower remarked on this question: --
 </p><p>
 "The view which appears best to accord with what is now known
 of the characters and distribution of the races of man . . . .
 is a modification of the monogenistic hypothesis (!). Without
 entering into the difficult question of the method of man's first
 appearance upon the world, we must assume for it a vast antiquity,
 at all events as measured by any historical standard. <em>If we
 had any approach to a complete palaeontological record, the history
 of Man could be re-constructed, but nothing of the kind is forthcoming.</em>"
 </p><p>
 Such an admission must be regarded as fatal to the dogmatism of
 the physical Evolutionists, and as opening a wide margin to occult
 speculations. The opponents of the Darwinian theory were, and
 still remain, polygenists. Such "intellectual giants"
 as John Crawford and James Hunt discussed the problem and favoured
 polygenesis, and in their day there was a far stronger feeling
 in favour of than against this theory. It is only in 1864 that
 Darwinians began to be wedded to the theory of unity, of which
 Messrs. Huxley and Lubbock became the first <em>coryphai.</em>

 As regards that other question, of the priority of man to the
 animals in the order of evolution, the answer is as promptly given.
 If man is really the Microcosm of the Macrocosm, then the teaching
 has nothing so very impossible in it, and is but logical. For,
 man becomes that Macrocosm for the three lower kingdoms under
 him. Arguing from a physical standpoint, all the lower kingdoms,
 save the mineral -- which is light itself, crystallised and immetallised
 -- from plants to the creatures which preceded the first mammalians,
 all have been consolidated in their physical structures by means
 of the "cast-off dust" of those minerals, and <em>the
 refuse of the human matter, whether from living or</em> <em>dead</em>

 <p>
 <em>bodies, on which they fed and which gave them their outer
 bodies. </em>In his turn, man grew more physical, by re-absorbing
 into his system that which he had given out, and which became
 transformed in the living animal crucibles through which it had
 passed, owing to Nature's alchemical transmutations. There were
 animals in those days of which our modern naturalists have never
 dreamed; and the stronger became physical material man, the giants
 of those times, the more powerful were his emanations. Once that
 Androgyne "humanity" separated into sexes, transformed
 by Nature into child-bearing engines, it ceased to procreate its
 like through drops of vital energy oozing out of the body. But
 while man was still ignorant of his procreative powers on the
 human plane, (before his Fall, as a believer in Adam would say,)
 all this vital energy, scattered far and wide from him, was used
 by Nature for the production of the first mammal-animal forms.
 Evolution is <em>an eternal cycle of becoming, </em>we are taught;
 and nature never leaves an atom unused. Moreover, from the beginning
 of the Round, all in Nature tends to become Man. All the impulses
 of the dual, centripetal and centrifugal Force are directed towards
 one point -- <strong>M</strong>AN. The progress in the succession
 of beings, says Agassiz, "consists in an increasing similarity
 of the living fauna, and, among the vertebrates, especially, in
 the increasing resemblance to man. Man is the end towards which
 all <em>animal </em>creation has tended from the first appearance
 of the first palaeozoic fishes."*
 </p><p>
 Just so; but "the palaeozoic fishes" being at the lower
 curve of the arc of the evolution of <em>forms, </em>this Round
 began with astral man, the <em>reflection of the Dhyan Chohans,
 called the </em>"<em>Builders.</em>" Man<em> is the
 alpha and the omega of objective creation. </em>As said in "<em>Isis
 Unveiled,</em>" "all things had their origin in spirit
 -- evolution having originally begun from above and proceeding
 downwards, instead of the reverse, as taught in the Darwinian
 theory."** Therefore, the tendency spoken of by the eminent
 naturalist above quoted, is one inherent in every atom. Only,
 were one to apply it to both sides of the evolution, the observations
 made would greatly interfere with the modern theory, which has
 now almost become (Darwinian) law.
 </p><p>
 But in citing the passage from Agassiz' work with approval, it
 must not be understood that the occultists are making <em>any
 concession </em>to the theory, which derives man from the animal
 kingdom. The fact that in this Round he preceded the mammalia
 is obviously not impugned by the consideration that the latter
 (mammalia) follow in the wake of man.

 To a Theist or a Christian this verse would suggest a rather theological
 idea: that of the Fall of the Angels through Pride. In the Secret
 Doctrine, however, the reasons for the refusal to incarnate in
 <em>half-ready </em>physical bodies seem to be more connected
 with physiological than metaphysical reasons. Not all the organisms
 were sufficiently ready. The incarnating powers chose the ripest
 fruits and spurned the rest.***
 </p><p>
 By a curious coincidence, when selecting a familiar name for the
 continent on which the first androgynes, the Third Root-Race,
 separated, the writer chose, on geographical considerations, that
 of "Lemuria," invented by Mr. P. L. Sclater. It is only
 later, that reading Haeckel's "Pedigree of Man," it
 was found that the German "Animalist" had chosen the
 name for his late continent. He traces, properly enough, the centre
 of human evolution to "Lemuria," but with a slight scientific
 variation. Speaking of it as that "cradle of mankind,"
 he pictures the gradual transformation of the anthropoid mammal
 into the primeval savage!! Vogt, again, holds that in America
 Man sprang from a branch of the platyrrhine apes, <em>independently
 </em>of the origination of the African and Asian root-stocks from
 the old world catarrhinians. Anthropologists are, as usual, at
 loggerheads on this question, as on many others. We shall examine
 this claim in the light of esoteric philosophy in Stanza <strong>VIII</strong>.
 Meanwhile, let us give a few moments of attention to the various
 consecutive modes of procreation according to the laws of Evolution.
 </p><p>
 Let us begin by the mode of reproduction of the later sub-races
 of the Third human race, by those who found themselves endowed
 with the<em> sacred fire </em>from the spark of higher and then
 independent Beings, who were the psychic and spiritual parents
 of Man, as the lower <em>Pitar Devata </em>(the <em>Pitris</em>)<em>
 </em>were the progenitors of his physical body. That Third and
 holy Race consisted of men who, at their zenith, were described
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * This is explained in the section which follows this series of
 Stanzas in the allegory from the Puranas concerning Kandu, the
 holy sage, and Pramlocha, the nymph alleged to have hypnotised
 him, (Vide § II, Commentary after St.I.), a suggestive allegory,
 scientifically, as the drops of perspiration, which she exuded,
 are the symbols of the spores of science (<em>Vide infra</em>).
 </p><p>
 ** This will be explained as we proceed. This unwillingness to
 fashion men, or create, is symbolized in the Puranas by Daksha
 having to deal with his opponent Narada, the "strife-making
 ascetic."
 </p><p>
 ***<em> Vide </em>Verse 24.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 172 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 as, "towering giants of godly strength and beauty, and the
 depositories of all the mysteries of Heaven and Earth." Have
 they likewise <em>fallen, </em>if, then, incarnation was the <em>Fall?</em>
 
 </p><p>
 Of this presently. The only thing now to be noted of these is,
 that the chief gods and heroes of the Fourth and Fifth Races,
 as of later antiquity, are the <em>deified images of these men
 of the Third. </em>The days of their physiological purity, and
 those of their so-called Fall, have equally survived in the hearts
 and memories of their descendants. Hence, the dual nature shown
 in those gods, both virtue and sin being exalted to their highest
 degree, in the biographies composed by posterity. They were the
 <em>pre-Adamite </em>and the divine Races, with which even theology,
 in whose sight they are all "the accursed Cainite Races,"
 now begins to busy itself.
 </p><p>
 But the action of "spiritual progenitors" of that Race
 has first to be disposed of. A very difficult and abstruse point
 has to be explained with regard to Stanzas 26 and 27. These say:
 --

 * The evolutionist Professor Schmidt alludes to "the fact
 of the separation of sexes, as to the derivation of which from
 species <em>once hermaphrodite </em>all (the believers in creation
 naturally excepted) are assuredly of one accord." Such indeed
 is the incontestable evidence drawn from the presence of rudimentary
 organs. (<em>Cf., his </em>"<em>Doctrine of Descent and Darwinism,</em>"<em>
 </em>p. 159.) Apart from such palpable traces of a primeval hermaphroditism,
 the fact may be noted that, as Laing writes, "a study of
 embryology. . . . shows that in the <em>human higher animal </em>species
 the distinction of sex is not developed until a <em>considerable
 progress </em>has been made in the growth of the embryo."
 ("<em>A Modern Zoroastrian,</em>"<em> </em>p.106.) The
 Law of Retardation -- operative alike in the case of human races,
 animal species, etc., when a higher type has once been evolved
 -- still preserves hermaphroditism as the reproductive method
 of the majority of plants and many lower animals.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 173 THE SONS OF KRIYASAKTI. </h6>
 
 <p>
 <em>Kumaras </em>of the Hindu Pantheon and Puranas, those elder
 sons of Brahma, "Sanandana and the other sons of <em>Vedhas,</em>"
 who, previously created by him "without desire or passion,
 remained chaste, full of holy wisdom and undesirous of progeny?"*
 </p><p>
 The power, by which they first created, is just that which has
 since caused them to be degraded from their high status to the
 position of evil spirits, of Satan and his Host, created in their
 turn by the unclean fancy of exoteric creeds. It was by <em>Kriyasakti,
 </em>that mysterious and divine power latent in the will of every
 man, and which, if not called to life, quickened and developed
 by Yogi-training, remains dormant in 999,999 men out of a million,
 and gets atrophied. This power is explained in the "Twelve
 Signs of the Zodiac,"** as follows: --
 </p><p>
 (<em>b</em>) "<em>Kriyasakti -- </em>the mysterious <em>power
 of thought </em>which enables it to produce external, perceptible,
 phenomenal results by its own inherent energy. The ancients held
 that any idea will manifest itself <em>externally, </em>if one's
 attention (and Will) is deeply concentrated upon it; similarly,
 an intense volition will be followed by the desired result. A
 Yogi generally performs his wonders by means of Itchasakti (Will-power)
 and Kriyasakti."
 </p><p>
 The Third Race had thus created the so-called <strong>S</strong>ONS
 OF <strong>W</strong>ILL AND <strong>Y</strong>OGA, or the "ancestors"
 (the <em>spiritual </em>forefathers) of all the subsequent and
 present Arhats, or Mahatmas, in a truly <em>immaculate </em>way.
 They were indeed <em>created, </em>not <em>begotten, </em>as were
 their brethren of the Fourth Race, who were generated sexually
 after the separation of sexes, the <em>Fall of Man. </em>For creation
 is but the result of will acting on phenomenal matter, the calling
 forth out of it the primordial divine <em>Light </em>and eternal
 <em>Life. </em>They were the "holy seed-grain" of the
 future Saviours of Humanity.
 </p><p>
 Here we have to make again a break, in order to explain certain
 difficult points, of which there are so many. It is almost impossible
 to avoid such interruptions. For explanations and a philosophical
 account of the nature of those beings, which are now viewed as
 the "Evil" and rebellious Spirits, the creators by Kriyasakti,
 the reader is referred to the chapters on "The Fallen Angels"
 and "The Mystic Dragons," in Part<strong> II</strong>.
 of this Volume.
 </p><p>
 The order of the evolution of the human Races stands thus in the
 Fifth Book of the Commentaries, and was already given: --
 </p><p>
 <em>The First men were Chhayas </em>(1)<em> </em>;<em> the second,
 the </em>"<em>Sweat-born</em>"<em> </em>(2)<em>, the
 Third, </em>"<em>Egg-born,</em>"<em> and the holy Fathers
 born by the power of Kriyasakti</em> (3);<em> the Fourth were
 the children of the Padmapani </em>(Chenresi) (4).

 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 174 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 Of course such primeval modes of procreation -- by the evolution
 of one's image, through drops of perspiration, after that by Yoga,
 and then by what people will regard as magic (Kriyasakti) -- are
 doomed beforehand to be regarded as fairy-tales. Nevertheless,
 beginning with the first and ending with the last, there is really
 nothing miraculous in them, nor anything which could not be shown
 natural. This must be proven.
 </p><p>
 1<em>. Chhaya-birth, </em>or that primeval mode of <em>sexless
 </em>procreation, the first Race having <em>oozed out, </em>so
 to say, from the bodies of the Pitris, is hinted at in a Cosmic
 allegory in the Puranas.* It is the beautiful allegory and story
 of Sanjna, the daughter of Viswakarman -- married to the Sun,
 who, "unable to endure the fervours of her lord," gave
 him her <em>chhaya </em>(shadow, image, or <em>astral </em>body),
 while she herself repaired to the jungle to perform religious
 devotions, or <em>Tapas. </em>The Sun, supposing the "chhaya"
 to be his wife begat by her children, like Adam with Lilith --
 an <em>ethereal shadow </em>also, as in the legend, though an
 actual living female monster millions of years ago.
 </p><p>
 But, perhaps, this instance proves little except the exuberant
 fancy of the Puranic authors. We have another proof ready. If
 the materialised forms, which are sometimes seen oozing out of
 the bodies of certain mediums could, instead of vanishing, be
 fixed and made solid -- the <em>creation </em>of the first Race
 would become quite comprehensible. This kind of procreation cannot
 fail to be suggestive to the student. Neither the mystery nor
 the <em>impossibility </em>of such a mode is certainly any greater
 -- while it is far more comprehensible to the mind of the true
 metaphysical thinker - than the mystery of the conception of the
 foetus, its gestation and birth as a child, as we now know it.
 </p><p>
 Now to the curious and little understood corroboration in the
 Puranas about the "Sweat-born."
 </p><p>
 2. Kandu is a sage and a Yogi, eminent in holy wisdom and pious
 austerities, which, finally, awaken the jealousy of the gods,
 who are represented in the Hindu Scriptures as being in never-ending
 strife with the ascetics. Indra, the "King of the Gods,"**
 finally sends one of his female Apsarasas to tempt the sage. This
 is no worse than Jehovah sending Sarah, Abraham's wife, to tempt
 Pharaoh; but in truth it is those gods (and god), who are ever
 trying to disturb ascetics and thus make them lose the fruit of
 their austerities, who ought to be regarded as "tempting
 demons," instead of applying the term to the Rudras, Kumaras,
 and Asuras, whose great sanctity and chastity seem a standing
 reproach to the Don Juanic gods of the Pantheon. But it is

 </em>in the possession of an Initiate in Southern India, the god
 is not Indra, but Kama, the god of love and desire. See text further
 on.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 175 A SAINT -- HYPNOTISED.</h6>
 
 <p>
 the reverse that we find in all the Puranic allegories, and not
 without good esoteric reason.
 </p><p>
 The king of the gods (or Indra) sends a beautiful Apsarasas (nymph)
 named Pramlocha to seduce Kandu and disturb his penance. She succeeds
 in her unholy purpose and "907 years six months and three
 days"* spent in her company seem to the sage as one day.
 When this psychological or hypnotic state ends, the Muni curses
 bitterly the creature who seduced him, thus disturbing his devotions.
 "Depart, begone!" he cries, "vile bundle of illusions!"
 . . . And Pramlocha, terrified, flies away, <em>wiping the perspiration
 from her body </em>with the leaves of the trees as she passes
 through the air. She went from tree to tree, and as, with the
 dusky shoots that crowned their summits, she dried her limbs,
 the child she had conceived by the Rishi came forth from the pores
 of her skin in drops of perspiration. The trees received the living
 dews; and the winds collected them into one mass. "This,"
 said Soma (the Moon), "I matured by my rays; and gradually
 it increased in size, till the exhalation that had rested on the
 tree tops became the lovely girl named Marisha."**
 </p><p>
 Now Kandu stands here for the <em>First Race. </em>He is a son
 of the Pitris, hence one <em>devoid of mind, </em>which is hinted
 at by his being unable to discern a period of nearly one thousand
 years from one day; therefore he is shown to be so easily deluded
 and blinded. Here is a variant of the allegory in <em>Genesis,
 </em>of Adam, born an image of clay, into which the "Lord-god"
 breathes the <em>breath of life </em>but not of intellect and
 discrimination, which are developed only after he had tasted of
 the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge; in other words when he has
 acquired the first development of Mind, and had implanted in him
 <em>Manas, </em>whose terrestrial aspect is of the Earth earthy,
 though its highest faculties connect it with Spirit and the <em>divine
 Soul. </em>Pramlocha is the Hindu Lilith of the Aryan Adam; and
 Marisha, the daughter born of the perspiration from her pores,
 is the "sweat-born," and stands as a symbol for the
 Second Race of Mankind.
 </p><p>
 As remarked in the foot note (<em>vide supra</em>)<em> </em>it
 is not Indra, who now figures in the Puranas, but Kamadeva, the
 god of love and desire, who sends Pramlocha on Earth. Logic, besides
 the esoteric doctrine, shows that it must be so. For Kama is the
 king and lord of the Apsarasas, of whom Pramlocha is one; and,
 therefore, when Kandu, in cursing her,

 * These are the exoteric figures given in a purposely reversed
 and distorted way, being the figure of the duration of the cycle
 between the first and second human race. All Orientalists to the
 contrary, there is not a word in any of the Puranas that has not
 a special esoteric meaning.

 ** "<em>Vishnu Purana,</em>"<em> </em>Book I., ch. 15.
 Cf. also Vivien's temptation of Merlin (Tennyson), the same legend
 in Irish tradition.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 176 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 exclaims "Thou hast performed the office assigned by the
 monarch of the gods, go!" he must mean by that monarch Kama
 and not Indra, to whom the Apsarasas are not subservient. For
 Kama, again, is in the Rig Veda (<em>x</em>. 129) the personification
 of that feeling which leads and propels to creation. He was the
 <em>first movement </em>that stirred the <strong>O</strong>NE,
 after its manifestation from the purely abstract principle, to
 create, "Desire first arose in It, which was the <em>primal
 germ of mind</em>;<em> </em>and which sages, searching with their
 intellect, have discovered to be the bond which connects Entity
 with Non-Entity." A hymn in the <em>Atharva Veda </em>exalts
 Kama into a supreme God and Creator, and says: "Kama was
 born the first. Him, neither gods nor fathers (Pitara) nor men
 have equalled." . . . . The Atharva Veda identifies him with
 <em>Agni</em>, but makes him superior to that god. The <em>Taittariya
 Brahmana </em>makes him allegorically the son of Dharma (moral
 religious duty, piety and justice) and of Sraddha (faith). Elsewhere
 Kama is born from the heart of Brahma; therefore he is <em>Atma-Bhu
 </em>"Self-Existent," and <em>Aja, </em>the "unborn."
 His sending Promlocha has a deep philosophical meaning; sent by
 Indra -- the narrative has none. As Eros was connected in early
 Greek mythology with the world's creation, and only afterwards
 became the sexual Cupid, so was Kama in his original Vedic character,
 (Harivansa making him a son of Lakshmi, who is Venus). The allegory,
 as said, shows the psychic element developing the physiological,
 before the birth of <em>Daksha, the progenitor of real physical
 men, </em>made to be born from Marisha and before whose time living
 beings and men were procreated "by the will, by sight, by
 touch and by Yoga," as will be shown.
 </p><p>
 This, then, is the allegory built on the mode of procreation of
 the <em>Second </em>or the "Sweat-born." The same for
 the <em>Third Race </em>in its final development.
 </p><p>
 Marisha, through the exertions of Soma, the Moon, is taken to
 wife by the <em>Prachetasas, </em>the production of the "Mind-born"
 sons of Brahma also*, from whom they beget the Patriarch Daksha,
 a son of Brahma
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------

 <p>
 * The text has: -- "From Brahma were born mind-engendered
 progeny, with forms and faculties derived from his corporeal nature,
 <em>embodied spirits </em>produced from the limbs (<em>gatra</em>)
 of <em>Dhimat </em>(all-wise deity). These beings were the abode
 of the three qualities of <em>deva-sarga </em>(divine creation,
 which, as the five-fold creation, is <em>devoid of clearness of
 perception, without reflection, </em>dull of nature). But as they
 <em>did not multiply themselves, </em>Brahma created "other
 mind-born sons like himself," namely, the Brahma-rishis,
 or the Prajapati (ten and seven). Sanandana and the other sons
 of Vedhas (Brahma) were previously created, but, as shown elsewhere,
 they were "<em>without desire or passion, </em>inspired with
 holy wisdom, estranged from the universe and undesirous of progeny"
 (<em>Book I, ch.</em> 7). These Sanandana and other Kumaras are
 then the Gods, who after refusing to "create progeny"
 are forced to incarnate in senseless men. The reader must pardon
 unavoidable repetitions in view of the great number of the facts
 given.</p><hr>

 also, in a former <em>Kalpa </em>or life, explain and add the
 Puranas, in order to mislead, yet speaking the truth.
 </p><p>
 (3.) The early Third Race, then, is formed from drops of "sweat,"
 which, after many a transformation, grow into human bodies. This
 is not more difficult to imagine or realise than the growth of
 the foetus from an imperceptible germ, which foetus develops into
 a child, and then into a strong, heavy man. But this race again
 changes its mode of procreation according to the Commentaries.
 It is said to have emanated a <em>vis formativa, </em>which changed
 the drops of perspiration into greater drops, which grew, expanded,
 and became ovoid bodies -- huge eggs. In these the human foetus
 gestated for several years. In the Puranas, Marisha, the daughter
 of Kandu, the sage, becomes the wife of the <em>Prachetasas </em>and
 the mother of Daksha. Now Daksha is the father of the first <em>human-like
 </em>progenitors, having been born in this way. He is mentioned
 later on. The evolution of man, the microcosm, is analogous to
 that of the Universe, the macrocosm. His evolution stands between
 that of the latter and that of the animal, for which man, in his
 turn, is a macrocosm.
 </p><p>
 Then the race becomes: --
 </p><p>
 (4.) The androgyne, or hermaphrodite. This process of men-bearing
 explains, perhaps, why Aristophanes* describes the nature of the
 old race as <em>androgynous, </em>the form of every individual
 being rounded, "having the back and sides as <em>in a circle,</em>"<em>
 </em>whose "manner of running was circular . . . . terrible
 in force and strength and with prodigious ambition." Therefore,
 to make them weaker, "Zeus divided them (in the Third Root-Race)
 into two, and Apollo (the Sun), under his direction, closed up
 the skin." The Madagascans (the island belonged to Lemuria)
 have a tradition about the first man, who lived at first without
 eating, and, having indulged in food, a swelling appeared in his
 leg; this bursting, there emerged from it a female, who became
 the mother of their race. Truly . . . "We have our sciences
 of <em>Heterogenesis </em>and<em> Parthenogenesis, </em>showing
 that the field is yet open. . . . . The polyps . . . . produce
 their offspring from themselves, like the buds and ramifications
 of a tree. . . . " Why not the primitive <em>human </em>polyp?
 The very interesting polyp <em>Stauridium </em>passes alternately
 from gemmation into the sex method of reproduction. Curiously
 enough, though it grows merely as a polyp on a stalk, it produces
 gemmules, which ultimately develop into a sea-nettle or <em>Medusa.
 </em>The Medusa is utterly dissimilar to its parent-organism,
 the Stauridium. It also reproduces itself differently, by sexual
 method, and from the resulting eggs <em>Stauridia </em>once more
 put in

 <p>
 an appearance. This striking fact may assist many to understand
 that a form may be evolved -- as in the <em>sexual </em>Lemurians
 from <em>Hermaphrodite </em>parentage -- quite unlike its immediate
 progenitors. It is, moreover, unquestionable that in the case
 of <em>human</em> incarnations the law of Karma, racial or individual,
 overrides the subordinate tendencies of "Heredity,"
 its servant.
 </p><p>
 The meaning of the last sentence in the above-quoted Commentary
 on Stanza 27, namely, that the Fourth Race were the children of
 Padmapani, may find its explanation in a certain letter from the
 Inspirer of "<em>Esoteric Buddhism</em>"<em> </em>quoted
 on p. 68. "The majority of mankind belongs to the seventh
 sub-race of the Fourth Root-Race -- the above-mentioned Chinamen
 and their off-shoots and branchlets. (Malayans, Mongolians, Tibetans,
 Hungarians, Finns, and even the Esquimaux are all remnants of
 this last offshoot.)"
 </p><p>
 Padmapani, or Avalokiteswara in Sanskrit, is, in Tibetan, Chenresi.
 Now, Avalokiteswara is the great <em>Logos </em>in its higher
 aspect and in the divine regions. But in the manifested planes,
 he is, like Daksha, the progenitor (in a spiritual sense) of men.
 Padmapani-Avalokiteswara is called <em>esoterically </em>Bhodhisatva
 (or Dhyan Chohan) <em>Chenresi Vanchug, </em>"the powerful
 and all-seeing." He is considered now as the greatest protector
 of Asia in general, and of Tibet in particular. In order to guide
 the Tibetans and Lamas in holiness, and preserve the great Arhats
 in the world, this heavenly Being is credited with manifesting
 himself from age to age in human form. A popular legend has it
 that whenever faith begins to die out in the world, Padmapani
 Chenresi, the "lotus-bearer," emits a brilliant ray
 of light, and forthwith incarnates himself in one of the two great
 Lamas -- the Dalai and Teschu Lamas; finally, it is believed that
 he will incarnate as "the most perfect Buddha" in Tibet,
 instead of in India, where his predecessors, the great Rishis
 and Manus had appeared in the beginning of our Race, but now appear
 no longer. Even the exoteric appearance of Dhyani Chenresi is
 suggestive of the esoteric teaching. He is evidently, like Daksha,
 the synthesis of all the preceding Races and the progenitor of
 all the <em>human </em>Races after the Third, the first complete
 one, and thus is represented as the <em>culmination of the four
 primeval </em>races in his <em>eleven-faced </em>form. It is a
 column built in four rows, each series having three faces or heads
 of different complexions: the three faces for each race being
 typical of its three fundamental physiological transformations.
 The first is white (moon-coloured); the second is yellow; the
 third, red-brown; the fourth, in which are only two faces -- the
 third face being left a blank -- (a reference to the untimely
 end of the Atlanteans) is brown-black. Padmapani (Daksha) is seated
 on the column, and forms the apex. In this reference</p><hr>

 compare Stanza 39. The Dhyan Chohan is represented with four arms,
 another allusion to the four races. For while two are folded,
 the third hand holds a lotus (<em>Padmapani, </em>"the lotus-bearer"),
 this flower symbolizing generation, and the fourth holds a serpent,
 emblem of the Wisdom in his power. On his neck is a rosary, and
 on his head the sign of water <img src="sd2-179.gif" align="BOTTOM">
 -- matter, deluge -- while on his brow rests the third eye (Siva's
 eye, that of spiritual insight). His name is "Protector"
 (of Tibet), "Saviour of Humanity." On other occasions
 when he has only two arms, he is Chenresi, the Dhyani and Bhodisatva,
 <em>Chakna-padmakarpo, </em>"he who holds a lotus."
 His other name is Chantong, "he of the 1,000 eyes,"
 when he is endowed with a thousand arms and hands, on the palm
 of each of which is represented an eye of Wisdom, these arms radiating
 from his body like a forest of rays. Another of his names is Lokapati
 and Lokanatha (Sanskrit) "Lord of the World"; and Jigtengonpo
 (Tibetan), "Protector and Saviour against evil" of any
 kind.

 Padmapani, however, is the "lotus-bearer" symbolically
 only for the profane; esoterically, it means the supporter of
 the Kalpas, the last of which, the present Maha-Kalpa (the Varaha),
 is called Padma, and represents one half of the life of Brahma.
 Though a minor Kalpa, it is called Maha, "great," because
 it comprises the age in which Brahma sprang from a lotus. Theoretically,
 the Kalpas are infinite, but practically they are divided and
 sub-divided in Space and Time, each division -- down to the smallest
 -- having its own Dhyani as patron or regent. Padmapani (Avalokiteshwara)
 becomes, in China, in his female aspect, Kwan-yin, "who assumes
 any form, at pleasure, in order to save mankind." The knowledge
 of the astrological aspect of the constellations on the respective
 "birth-days" of these Dhyanis -- Amitabha (the O-mi-to
 Fo, of China), included: <em>e.g.</em>, on the 19th day of the
 second month, on the 17th day of the eleventh month, and on the
 7th day of the third month, etc., etc. -- gives the Occultist
 the greatest facilities for performing what are called "magic"
 feats. The future of an individual is seen, with all its coming
 events marshalled in order, in a <em>magic </em>mirror placed
 under the ray of certain constellations. But -- beware of the
 reverse of the medal, <strong>S</strong>ORCERY. </p><hr>
