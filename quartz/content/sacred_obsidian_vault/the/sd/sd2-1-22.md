 <strong>T</strong>HE <strong>O</strong>RIGIN OF THE <strong>S</strong>ATANIC
 <strong>M</strong>YTH.
 </p><p>
 Let us then fathom this creation of the Patristic fancy still
 deeper, and find its prototype with the Pagans. The origin of
 the new <em>Satanic</em> myth is easy to trace. The tradition
 of the Dragon and the Sun is echoed in every part of the world,
 both in its civilized and semi-savage regions. It took rise in
 the whisperings about secret initiations among the profane, and
 was established universally through the once universal heliolatrous
 religion. There was a time when the four parts of the world were
 covered with the temples sacred to the Sun and the Dragon;</p><hr>

 <p>
 but the cult is now preserved mostly in China and the Buddhist
 countries, "Bel and the Dragon being uniformly coupled together,
 and the priest of the Ophite religion as uniformly assuming the
 name of his <em>God</em>"<em> </em>("<em>Archaeology,</em>"<em>
 </em>Vol. xxv., p. 220, London). In the religions of the past,
 it is in Egypt we have to seek for its Western origin. The Ophites
 adopted their rites from Hermes Trismegistus, and heliolatrous
 worship crossed over with its Sun-gods into the land of the Pharaohs
 from India. In the gods of Stonehenge we recognise the divinities
 of Delphi and Babylon, and in those of the latter the devas of
 the Vedic nations. Bel and the Dragon, Apollo and Python, Krishna
 and Kaliya, Osiris and Typhon are all one under many names --
 the latest of which are Michael and the Red Dragon, and St. George
 and his Dragon. As Michael is "one as God," or his "Double,"
 for terrestrial purposes, and is one of the Elohim, the fighting
 angel, he is thus simply a permutation of Jehovah. Whatever the
 Cosmic or astronomical event that first gave rise to the allegory
 of the "War of Heaven," its earthly origin has to be
 sought in the temples of Initiation and archaic crypts. The following
 are the proofs: --
 </p><p>
 We find (<em>a</em>) the priests assuming the name of the gods
 they served; (<em>b</em>) the "Dragons" held throughout
 all antiquity as the symbols of Immortality and Wisdom, of secret
 Knowledge and of Eternity; and (<em>c</em>) the hierophants of
 Egypt, of Babylon, and India, styling themselves generally the
 "Sons of the Dragon" and "Serpents"; thus
 the teachings of the Secret Doctrine are thereby corroborated.
 </p><p>
 There were numerous catacombs in Egypt and Chaldea, some of them
 of a very vast extent. The most renowned of them were the subterranean
 crypts of Thebes and Memphis. The former, beginning on the western
 side of the Nile, extended towards the Lybian desert, and were
 known as the <em>Serpent</em>'<em>s </em>catacombs, or passages.
 It was there that were performed the sacred mysteries of the <em>kuklos
 anagkes, </em>the "Unavoidable Cycle," more generally
 known as "the circle of necessity"; the inexorable doom
 imposed upon every soul after the bodily death, and when it has
 been judged in the Amenthian region.
 </p><p>
 In de Bourbourg's book, <em>Votan, </em>the Mexican demi-god,
 in narrating his expedition, describes a subterranean passage
 which ran underground, and terminated at the root of the heavens,
 adding that this passage was a snake's hole, "un agujero
 de colubra"; and that he was admitted to it because he was
 himself "a son of the snakes," or a serpent. ("Die
 Phoinizier," 70.)
 </p><p>
 This is, indeed, very suggestive; for his description of the <em>snake</em>'<em>s</em>
 <em>hole </em>is that of the ancient Egyptian crypt, as above
 mentioned. The hierophants, moreover, of Egypt, as of Babylon,
 generally styled them-</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 380 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 selves the "Sons of the Serpent-god," or "Sons
 of the Dragon," during the mysteries.
 </p><p>
 "The Assyrian priest bore always the name of his god,"
 says Movers. The Druids of the Celto-Britannic regions also called
 themselves snakes. "I am a Serpent, I am a Druid," they
 exclaimed. The Egyptian Karnak is twin brother to the Carnac of
 Bretagne, the latter Carnac meaning the serpent's mount. The Dracontia
 once covered the surface of the globe, and these temples were
 sacred to the Dragon, only because it was the symbol of the sun,
 which, in its turn, was the symbol of the highest god -- the Phoenician
 Elon or Elion, whom Abraham recognised as El Elion.* Besides the
 surname of serpents, they were called the "builders,"
 the "architects"; for the immense grandeur of their
 temples and monuments was such that even now the pulverised remains
 of them "frighten the mathematical calculations of our modern
 engineers," says Taliesin.**
 </p><p>
 De Bourbourg hints that the chiefs of the name of <em>Votan, the
 Quetzo-Cohuatl, </em>or Serpent deity of the Mexicans, are the
 descendants of Ham and Canaan. "I am Hivim," they say.
 "Being a Hivim, I am of the great race of the Dragon (snake).
 I am a snake myself, for I am a Hivim." ("Cartas,"
 51;<em> </em>"<em>Isis Unveiled,</em>"<em> </em>Vol.
 I., 553, <em>et seq.</em>)
 </p><p>
 Furthermore, the "War in Heaven" is shown, in one of
 its significations, to have meant and referred to those terrible
 struggles in store for the candidate for adeptship, between himself
 and his (by magic) personified human passions, when the <em>inner
 </em>enlightened man had to either slay them or fail. In the former
 case he became the "Dragon-Slayer," as having happily
 overcome all the temptations; and a "Son of the Serpent"
 and a Serpent himself, having cast off his old skin and being
 born in a <em>new</em> body, becoming a Son of Wisdom and Immortality
 in Eternity. (See Part <strong>II</strong>. on the Satanic Myth.)
 </p><p>
 Seth, the reputed forefather of Israel, is only a Jewish travesty
 of Hermes, the God of Wisdom, called also Thoth, Tat, Seth, Set,
 and Satan. He is also Typhon -- the same as Apophis, the Dragon
 slain by Horus; for Typhon was also called Set. He is simply the
 <em>dark side </em>of Osiris, his brother, as Angra Mainyu is
 the black shadow of Ahura-mazda. Terrestrially, all these allegories
 were connected with the trials of adeptship and initiation. Astronomically,
 they referred to the Solar and Lunar eclipses, the mythical explanations
 of which we find to this day in India and Ceylon, where any one
 can study the allegorical narratives and traditions which have
 remained unchanged for many thousands of years.

 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 381 THE THEFT OF RAHU.</h6>
 
 <p>
 Rahu, mythologically is a <em>Daitya -- </em>a giant, a Demi-god,
 the lower part of whose body ended in a Dragon or Serpent's tail.
 During the churning of the Ocean, when the gods produced amrita
 -- the water of Immortality -- he stole some of it, and drinking,
 became immortal. The Sun and Moon, who had detected him in his
 theft, denounced him to Vishnu, who placed him in the stellar
 spheres, the upper portion of his body representing the Dragon's
 head and the lower (Ketu) the Dragon's tail; the two being the
 ascending and descending nodes. Since then, Rahu wreaks his vengeance
 on the Sun and Moon by occasionally swallowing them. But this
 fable had another mystic meaning, since <em>Rahu, </em>the Dragon's
 head, played a prominent part in the mysteries of the <em>Sun's
 </em>(<em>Vikarttana</em>'<em>s</em>)<em> </em>initiation, when
 the candidate and the Dragon had a supreme fight.
 </p><p>
 The caves of the Rishis, the abodes of Tiresias and the Greek
 seers, were modelled on those of the <em>Nagas -- </em>the Hindu
 <em>King-Snakes, who </em>dwelled in cavities of the rocks under
 the ground. From <em>Sesha, the</em> thousand-headed Serpent,
 on which Vishnu rests, down to Python, the dragon <em>serpent
 oracle, </em>all point to the secret meaning of the myth. In India
 we find the fact mentioned in the earliest Puranas. The children
 of Surasa are the "mighty Dragons." The <em>Vayu </em>Purana
 replacing "Surasa" (of <em>Vishnu </em>Purana) by Danayas
 or <em>Danavas -- </em>the descendants of Danu by the sage Kasyapa
 -- and those Danavas being the giants (or Titans) who warred against
 the gods, they are thus shown identical with the "Dragons"
 and "Serpents" of Wisdom.
 </p><p>
 By simply comparing the Sun-gods of every country, one may find
 their allegories agreeing perfectly with one another; and the
 more the allegorical symbol is occult the more its corresponding
 symbol in other systems agrees with it. Thus, if from three systems
 widely differing from each other in appearance -- the old Aryan,
 the ancient Greek, and the modern Christian schemes -- we select
 several Sun-gods and dragons at random, these will be found copied
 from each other.
 </p><p>
 Let us take Agni the fire-god, Indra the firmament, and Karttikeya
 from the Hindus; the Greek Apollo; and <em>Mikael, </em>the "Angel
 of the Sun," the first of the AEons, called by the Gnostics
 "the saviour" -- and proceed in order.
 </p><p>
 (1) Agni -- the fire-god -- is called in the Rig-Veda Vaiswanara.
 Now Vaisvanara is a Danava -- a giant-demon,* whose daughters
 Puloma and Kalaka are the mothers of numberless Danavas (30 millions),
 by
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * He is thus named and included in the list of the Danavas in
 <em>Vayu Purana</em>; the Commentator of Bhagavata Purana calls
 him a son of Danu, but the name means also "Spirit of Humanity."

 <p>
 Kasyapa,* and live in <em>Hiranyapura, </em>"<em>the golden
 city,</em>"<em> floating in the air</em>. Therefore, Indra
 is, in a fashion, the step-son of these two as a son of Kasyapa;
 and Kasyapa is, in this sense, identical with Agni, the fire-god,
 or Sun (Kasyapa-Aditya). To this same group belongs Skanda or
 Karttikeya (god of War, the <em>six-faced </em>planet Mars astronomically),
 a Kumara, or virgin-youth, born of Agni** for the purpose of destroying
 Taraka, the Danava Demon, the grandson of Kasyapa by Hiranyaksha,
 his son,*** whose (Taraka's) yogi austerities were so extraordinary
 that they became formidable to the gods, who feared such a rival
 in power.**** While Indra, the bright god of the Firmament, kills
 Vritra (or Ahi), the Serpent-Demon -- for which feat he is called
 <em>Vritra-han, </em>"the destroyer of Vritra"; he also
 leads the hosts of <em>Devas </em>(Angels or gods) against other
 gods who rebel against Brahma, for which he is entitled <em>Jishnu,</em>
 "leader of the celestial Host." Karttikeya is found
 bearing the same titles. For killing Taraka, the Danava, he is
 Taraka-Jit, "Vanquisher of Taraka,"***** "<em>Kumara
 Guha,</em>"<em> </em>"the mysterious Virgin-youth"
 "<em>Siddha-Sena</em>"<em> -- </em>"the leader
 of the Siddhas"; and <em>Saktidhara </em>-- "Spear-holder."
 </p><p>
 (2.) Now take Apollo, the Grecian sun-god, and by comparing the
 mythical accounts given of him, see whether he does not answer
 both
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * Kasyapa is called the Son of Brahma, and is the "Self-Born"
 to whom a great part of the work of creation is attributed. He
 is one of the seven Rishis; <em>exoterically,</em> the son of
 Marichi, the son of Brahma; while Atharva-veda says, "The
 Self-born Kasyapa sprang from Time"; and <em>esoterically
 -- </em>Time and Space are forms of the One <em>incognizable </em>Deity.
 As an <em>Aditya, </em>Indra is son of Kasyapa, as also Vaivasvata
 Manu, our progenitor. In the instance given in the text, he is
 Kasyapa-Aditya, <em>the Sun, and</em> <em>the Sun-god, from whom
 all </em>the "Cosmic" Demons, Dragons (nagas), Serpent,
 or Snake-gods, and Danavas, the giants, are born. The meaning
 of the allegories given above is purely astronomical and cosmical,
 but will serve to prove the identity of all.
 </p><p>
 ** All such stories differ in the <em>exoteric </em>texts. In
 the Mahabharata, Karttikeya, "the six-faced Mars," is
 the son of Rudra or Siva, Self-born <em>without a mother </em>from
 the seed of Siva cast into the fire. But Karttikeya is generally
 called <em>Agnibhu, </em>"fire born."
 </p><p>
 *** Hiranyaksha is the ruler or king of the <em>fifth</em> region
 of Patala, a Snake-god.
 </p><p>
 **** The <em>Elohim </em>also feared the knowledge of Good and
 Evil for Adam, and therefore are shown as expelling him from Eden
 or killing him <em>spiritually.</em> 
 </p><p>
 ***** The story told is, that Taraka (called also Kalabhana),
 owing to his extraordinary Yoga-powers, had obtained all the divine
 knowledge of yoga-vidya and occult powers of the gods, who conspired
 against him. Here we see the "obedient" Host of <em>Archangels
 </em>or minor gods conspiring against the (future) <em>Fallen
 </em>angels, whom Enoch accuses of the great crime of disclosing
 to the world all "the <em>secret things </em>done in heaven."
 It is Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Surgal and Uriel who denounced
 to the Lord God those of their Brethren who were said <em>to have
 pried into the divine mysteries</em> and taught them to men: by
 this means they themselves escaped a like punishment. Michael
 was commissioned to fight the Dragon, and so was Karttikeya, and
 under the same circumstances. Both are "leaders of the Celestial
 Host," both Virgins, both "leaders of Saints,"
 "Spear-holders" (<em>Saktidhara</em>),<em> </em>etc.,
 etc. Karttikeya is the original of Michael and St. George, as
 surely as Indra is the prototype of Karttikeya.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 383 THE GODS, THE FACETS OF ONE GEM. </h6>
 
 <p>
 to Indra, Karttikeya, and even Kasyapa-Aditya, and at the same
 time to Michael (as the Angelic form of Jehovah) the "angel
 of the Sun," who is "like," and "one with,
 God." Later ingenious interpretations for monotheistic purposes,
 elevated though they be into not-to-be questioned Church dogmas,
 prove nothing, except the abuse of human authority and power,
 perhaps.
 </p><p>
 Apollo is <em>Helios </em>(the Sun), Phoibus-Apollo ("the
 light of life and of the World"*) who arises out of the golden-winged
 cup (the sun); hence he is the sun-god <em>par excellence. </em>At
 the moment of his birth he asks for his bow to kill Python, the
 Demon Dragon, who attacked his mother before his birth,** and
 whom he is divinely commissioned to destroy -- like Karttikeya,
 who is born for the purpose of killing Taraka, <em>the too holy
 and wise demon. </em>Apollo is born on a sidereal island called
 <em>Asteria -- </em>"the golden star island," the "earth
 which floats in the air," which is the Hindu golden <em>Hiranyapura</em>;<em>
 </em>"he is called the pure, [[<em>agnos</em>]]<em>, Agnus
 Dei </em>(the Indian <em>Agni</em>, as Dr. Kenealy thinks), and
 in the primal myth he is exempt "from all sensual love"
 ("<em>Book</em> <em>of God,</em>"<em> </em>p. 88). He
 is, therefore, a <em>Kumara, </em>like Karttikeya, and as Indra
 was in his earlier life and biographies. Python, moreover, the
 "red Dragon," connects Apollo with Michael, who fights
 the Apocalyptic Dragon, who wants to attack the woman in child-birth
 (See <em>Revelation xii.</em>)<em>, </em>as Python attacks Apollo's
 mother. Can any one fail to see the identity? Had the Rt. Hon.
 W. E. Gladstone, who prides himself on his Greek scholarship and
 understanding of the spirit of Homer's allegories, ever had a
 real inkling of the <em>esoteric </em>meaning of the <em>Iliad
 </em>and <em>Odyssey, </em>he would have understood St. John's
 "<em>Revelation,</em>"<em> </em>and even the Pentateuch,
 better than he does. For the way to the Bible lies through Hermes,
 Bel, and Homer, as the way to these is through the Hindu and Chaldean
 religious symbols.
 </p><p>
 The repetition of this archaic tradition is found in ch. xii.
 of St. John's <em>Revelations, </em>and comes from the Babylonian
 legends without the smallest doubt, though the Babylonian story
 had its origin in the allegories of the Aryans. The fragment read
 by the late George Smith (See "The Chaldean account of Genesis,"
 p. 304) is sufficient to disclose the source of the xii. chapter
 of the Apocalypse. Here it is as given by the eminent Assyriologist:
 </p><p>
 "Our . . . fragment refers to the creation of <em>mankind,
 </em>called Adam; as (the man) in the Bible, he is made perfect
 . . . but afterwards joins

 <p>
 * The "life and the light" of the material <em>physical
 </em>world, the delight of the senses -- not of the soul. Apollo
 is pre-eminently the <em>human </em>god, the god of emotional,
 pomp-loving and theatrical Church ritualism, with lights and music.
 </p><p>
 ** See chap. xii. in <em>Revelation </em>where we find Apollo's
 mother persecuted by that Python, the Red Dragon, who is also
 <em>Porphyrion, </em>the scarlet or red Titan.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 384 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 with the dragon of the Deep, the animal of Tiamat, the Spirit
 of Chaos, and offends against his god, who <em>curses him, </em>and
 calls down on his head all the evils and troubles of Humanity."*
 </p><p>
 "This is followed by a war between the dragon and the powers
 of evil, or chaos on one side and the gods on the other."
 </p><p>
 "The gods have weapons forged for them,** and Merodach (the
 archangel Michael in <em>Revelation</em>) undertakes to lead the
 heavenly host against the dragons. The war, which is described
 with spirit, ends, of course, in the triumph of the principles
 of Good. . . . ."***
 </p><p>
 This war of gods with the powers of the Deep, refers also, in
 its last and terrestrial application, to the struggle between
 the Aryan adepts of the nascent Fifth Race and the Sorcerers of
 Atlantis, the Demons of the Deep, the Islanders surrounded with
 water who disappeared in the Deluge. (See the last pages of Vol.
 I., "<em>Isis Unveiled,</em>"<em> </em>Atlantis.)
 </p><p>
 The symbols of the dragons and "War in Heaven" have,
 as already stated, more than one significance; religious, astronomical
 and geological events being included in the one common allegory.
 But it had also a Cosmological meaning. In India the Dragon story
 is repeated in one of its forms in the battles of Indra with <em>Vritra.
 </em>In the Vedas this Ahi-Vritra is referred to as the Demon
 of Drought, the terrible hot Wind. Indra is shown to be constantly
 at war with him; and with the help of his thunder and lightning
 the god compels Ahi-Vritra to pour down in rain on Earth, and
 then slays him. Hence, Indra is called the <em>Vritra-Han </em>or
 "the slayer of Vritra," as Michael is called the Conqueror
 and "Slayer of the Dragon." Both these "Enemies"
 are then the "Old Dragon" precipitated into the depths
 of the Earth, in this one sense.
 </p><p>
 The Zend-Avestic Amshaspends are a Host with a leader like St.
 Michael over them, and seem identical with the legions of Heaven,
 when one reads the <em>Vendidad. </em>Thus in Fargard <strong>XIX</strong>.,
 ii. 13 (42), Zarathustra is told by Ahura Mazda to "invoke
 the Amesha Spenta who rule over the seven <em>Karshvares</em>****<em>
 </em>of the Earth"; which Karshvares in their seven
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * No "god" who <em>curses </em>his (supposed) own work,
 because he has made it imperfect, can be the one infinite absolute
 wisdom, whether called Bel or Jehovah.
 </p><p>
 ** In the Indian allegory of <em>Tarakamaya, </em>the war between
 the gods and the Asuras headed by Soma (the moon, the King of
 Plants), it is Viswa-Karma, the artificer of the gods, who forges,
 like Vulcan (Tubal-Kain), their weapons for them.
 </p><p>
 *** We have said elsewhere that the "woman with child"
 of Revelation (xii.) was Aime, the great mother, or Binah, the
 third Sephiroth, "whose name is Jehovah"; and the "Dragon,"
 who seeks to devour her coming child (the Universe), is the Dragon
 of absolute Wisdom -- that Wisdom which, recognising the non-separateness
 of the Universe and everything in it from the Absolute <strong>A</strong>LL,
 sees in it no better than the great Illusion, <em>Mahamaya, </em>hence
 the cause of misery and suffering.

 **** The "Seven Karshvares of the Earth" -- the seven
 spheres of our planetary chain, [[Footnote continued on next page]]
 </p><hr>
 
 <p>
 [[Vol. 2, Page]] 385 THE BUILDERS OF THE MATERIAL WORLD.
 </p><p>
 applications refer equally to the seven spheres of our planetary
 chain, to the seven planets, the seven heavens, etc., according
 to whether the sense is applied to a physical, supra-mundane,
 or simply a sidereal world. In the same Fargard (ii. and iii.),
 in his invocation against Angra Mainyu and his Host, Zarathustra
 appeals to them in these words: "I invoke the seven bright
 <em>Sravah </em>with their sons and their flocks" (42 <em>Vendid.</em>
 <em>Saddh</em>)<em>. </em>The "Sravah" -- a word which
 the Orientalists have given up as one "of unknown meaning"
 -- means the same Amshaspends, but in their highest occult meaning.
 The "<em>Sravah</em>"<em> </em>are the noumenoi of the
 phenomenal Amshaspends, the souls or spirits of those <em>manifested</em>
 Powers; and "their sons and their flock" refers to the
 planetary angels and their sidereal flock of stars and constellations.
 "Amshaspend" is the exoteric term used in terrestrial
 combinations and affairs only. Zarathustra addresses Ahura Mazda
 constantly as "thou, the maker <em>of the</em> <em>material
 </em>world." Ormazd is the father of our earth (Spenta Armaiti),
 and she is referred to, when personified, as "the fair daughter
 of Ahura Mazda" (<em>Fargard, </em><strong>XIX</strong>.
 ii.), who is also the creator of the Tree (of occult and spiritual
 knowledge and wisdom) from which the mystic and mysterious <em>Caresma
 </em>is taken. But the occult name of the bright God was never
 pronounced outside the temple.
 </p><p>
 Samael or Satan, the seducing Serpent of Genesis, and one of the
 primeval angels who rebelled, is the name of the "Red Dragon."
 He is the Angel of <em>Death, </em>the Talmud saying that "the
 Angel of Death and Satan are the same," and, killed by Michael,
 he is once more killed by St. George, who also is a Dragon Slayer;
 but see the transformations of this. Samael is identical with
 the <em>Simoom, </em>the hot wind of the desert, or again with
 the Vedic demon of drought, as Vritra; "<em>Simoom </em>is
 called <em>Atabutos</em>" or <em>-- Diabolos, </em>the devil.
 </p><p>
 Typhon, or the Dragon Aphophis -- the<em> Accuser </em>in the
 "Book of the Dead" -- is worsted by Horus, who pierces
 his opponent's head with a spear; and Typhon is the all-destroying
 wind of the desert, the rebellious element that throws everything
 into confusion. As <em>Set -- </em>he is the darkness of night,
 the murderer of Osiris, who is the light of day and the sun. Archaeology
 demonstrates that Horus is identical with Anubis,* whose effigy
 was discovered upon an Egyptian monument, with a cuirass and a
 spear, like Michael and St. George. Anubis is also represented

 <p>
 the seven worlds -- also mentioned in the Rig-Veda -- are fully
 referred to elsewhere. There are six <em>rajamsi</em> (worlds)
 above <em>prithivi</em> -- the earth, or "this" (idam),
 as opposed to that which is <em>yonder </em>(the six globes on
 the three other planes). (See <em>Rig-Veda, I., </em>34;<em> III.,
 </em>56;<em> VII., </em>10411<em>, and V., </em>60, 6<em>. </em>See

 as slaying a dragon, that has the head and tail of a serpent.
 (See Lenoir's "Du Dragon de Metz.")
 </p><p>
 Cosmologically, then, all the Dragons and Serpents conquered by
 their "Slayers" are, in their origin, the turbulent
 confused principles in Chaos, brought to order by the Sun-gods
 or <em>creative </em>powers. In the "Book of the Dead"
 those principles are called "the Sons of Rebellion."
 (See also "<em>Egyptian Pantheon,</em>"<em> </em>pp.<em>
 20, 23.</em>)<em> </em>"In that night, the oppressor, the
 murderer of Osiris, otherwise called the <em>deceiving Serpent
 </em>(Verse 54) . . . . calls the Sons of Rebellion in <em>Air,</em>
 and when they arrive to the East of Heavens, then there is War
 in Heaven and in the entire World" (v. 49, "<em>Book
 of the Dead,</em>"<em> </em>xvii.).
 </p><p>
 In the Scandinavian <em>Eddas</em> the "War" of the
 Ases with the Hrim-thurses (frost-giants), and of Asathor with
 the Jotuns, the Serpents and Dragons and the "wolf"
 who comes out of "Darkness" --- is the repetition of
 the same myth. The "evil Spirits,"* having begun by
 being simply the emblems of Chaos, became euhemerized by the superstition
 of the rabble, until they have finally won the right of citizenship
 in the most civilized and learned races of this globe -<em>- since
 its creation </em>as alleged -- and became a dogma with Christians.
 As George Smith has it: "The evil principles (Spirits) emblems
 of Chaos" (in Chaldea and Assyria as in Egypt, we see) .
 . "resist this change and make war on the Moon, the eldest
 son of Bel, drawing over to their side the Sun, Venus and the
 atmospheric god Vul." ("Assyrian Discoveries,"
 p. 403.) This is only another version of the Hindu "War in
 Heaven," between Soma, the moon, and the gods -- Indra being
 the atmospheric Vul; which shows it plainly to be both a Cosmogonical
 and an astronomical allegory, woven into and drawn from the earliest
 theogony as taught in the Mysteries.
 </p><p>
 It is in the religious doctrines of the Gnostics that the real
 meaning of the Dragon, the Serpent, the Goat, and all those symbols
 of powers now called <em>Evil</em>, can be seen the best; as it
 is they who divulged the esoteric nature of the Jewish Substitute
 for <strong>AIN-SOPH </strong><em>in their </em>teachings; of
 the true meaning of which, while the Rabbins concealed it, the
 Christians, with a few exceptions, knew nothing. Surely Jesus
 of Nazareth would have hardly advised his apostles to show themselves
 as <em>wise </em>as the serpent, had the latter been a symbol
 of the <em>Evil one</em>;<em> </em>nor would the Ophites, the
 learned Egyptian Gnostics of "the Brotherhood of the Serpent,"
 have reverenced a living snake in their ceremonies as the emblem
 of <strong>WISDOM</strong><em>, </em>the divine <em>Sophia </em>(and
 a type of the all-good, not the all-bad), were that reptile so
 closely connected with Satan. The fact is, that even as a common
 ophidian it has ever been a dual symbol; and

 with Satan or the Great Dragon. They are the Elementals generated

 <p>
 as a Dragon it had never been anything else than a symbol of the
 manifested Deity in its great Wisdom. The <em>Draco volans, </em>the
 flying Dragon of the early painters, may be an exaggerated picture
 of the real extinct antediluvian animal; but those who have faith
 in the Occult teachings believe that in the days of old there
 were such creatures as flying Dragons, or a kind of Pterodactyl,
 and that it is those gigantic winged lizards that served as the
 prototypes for the Seraph of Moses and his great Brazen Serpent.*
 The Jews had worshipped the latter <em>idol </em>themselves, but,
 after the religious reforms brought about by Hezekiah, turned
 round, and called that symbol of the great or Higher God of every
 other nation -- a Devil, and their own usurper -- the "One
 God."**
 </p><p>
 The appellation Sa'tan, in Hebrew <em>satan, </em>"an adversary"
 (from the verb <em>shatana, </em>"to be adverse," to
 persecute) belongs by right to the first and cruelest "<em>adversary
 of all the other gods</em>"<em> </em>-- Jehovah, not to the
 Serpent, which spoke only words of sympathy and wisdom, and is
 at the worst, even in the dogma, "the adversary of men."
 This dogma, based as it is on chapter iii. of <em>Genesis, </em>is
 as illogical and unjust as it is paradoxical. For who was the
 first to <em>create </em>that original and hence-forward universal
 tempter of man -- the woman? Not the serpent surely, but the "Lord
 God" himself, who, saying: -- "It is not good that the
 man should be alone" -- made woman, and "brought her
 unto the man" (18-22). If the unpleasant little incident
 that followed <em>was </em>and is still to be regarded as the
 "original sin," then it exhibits the Creator's divine
 foresight in a poor light indeed. It would have been far better
 for the first Adam (of chap. 1.) to have been left either "male
 and female," or "alone." It is the Lord God, evidently,
 who was the real cause of all the mischief, the "<em>agent
 provocateur,</em>"<em> </em>and the Serpent -- only a prototype
 of <em>Azazel, </em>"the scapegoat for the sin of (the God
 of) Israel," the poor <em>Tragos </em>having to pay the penalty
 for his Master's and Creator's blunder. This, of course, is addressed
 only to those who accept the opening events of the drama of humanity
 in <em>Genesis </em>in their dead-letter sense. Those who read
 them esoterically, are not reduced to fanciful

 * See Numbers xxi. 8-9. God orders Moses to build a brazen Serpent
 "Saraph"; <em>to look upon which </em>heals those bitten
 by the <em>fiery serpents. </em>The latter were the <em>Seraphim</em>,
 each one of which, as Isaiah shows (vi. 2), "<em>had six
 wings</em>";<em> </em>they are the symbols of Jehovah, and
 of all the other Demiurgi who produce out of themselves six sons
 or likenesses -- Seven with their Creator. Thus, the Brazen Serpent
 <em>is</em> Jehovah, the chief of the "fiery serpents."
 And yet, in 2 Kings xviii., it is shown that King Hezekiah, who,
 like as David his father, "did that which was right in the
 sight of the Lord" -- "brake in pieces the brazen serpent
 that Moses had made . . . and called it <em>Nehushtan,</em>"<em>
 </em>or piece of brass.

 ** And Satan stood up against Israel and moved David to number
 Israel (Chron. xxi. 1.) "The anger of the Lord Jehovah was
 kindled against Israel," and he moved David to say: "Go,
 number Israel" (2 Samuel, xxiv. 1). The two are then identical.

 speculations and hypothesis; <em>they know </em>how to read the
 symbolism therein contained, and cannot err.
 </p><p>
 There is at present no need to touch upon the mystic and manifold
 meaning of the name Jehovah in its abstract sense, one independent
 of the Deity <em>falsely </em>called by that name. It was a blind
 created purposely by the Rabbins, a secret preserved by them with
 ten-fold care after the Christians had despoiled them of this
 God-name which was their own property.* But the following statement
 is made. The personage who is named in the first four chapters
 of <em>Genesis </em>variously as "God," the "Lord
 God," and "Lord" simply, is not one and the same
 person; certainly it is not <em>Jehovah.</em> There are three
 distinct classes or groups of the Elohim called Sephiroth in the
 Kabala, Jehovah appearing only in chapter iv., in the first verse
 of which he is named Cain, and in the last transformed into <em>mankind
 -- </em>male and female, jah-veh.** The "Serpent," moreover,
 is not Satan, but the bright Angel, one of the <em>Elohim </em>clothed
 in radiance and glory, who, promising the woman that if they ate
 of the forbidden fruit "<em>ye shall not surely die,</em>"<em>
 </em>kept his promise, and made man immortal in his <em>incorruptible
 nature. </em>He is the Iao of the mysteries, the chief of the
 Androgyne creators of men. Chapter iii. contains (esoterically)
 the withdrawal of the veil of ignorance that closed the perceptions
 of the Angelic Man, made in the image of the "Boneless"
 gods, and the opening of his consciousness to his real nature;
 thus showing the bright Angel (Lucifer) in the light of a giver
 of Immortality, and as the "Enlightener"; while the
 real Fall into generation and matter is to be sought in chapter
 iv. There, Jehovah-Cain, the male part of Adam the <em>dual </em>man,
 having separated himself from Eve, creates in her "Abel,"
 <em>the first natural woman,</em>*<em> </em>and sheds the <em>Virgin
 blood. </em>Now Cain, being shown identical with Jehovah, on the
 authority of the correct reading of verse i. (chapter iv., Genesis),
 in the original Hebrew text; and the Rabbins teaching that "<em>Kin
 </em>(Cain), the Evil, was the Son of Eve by Samael, the devil
 who took Adam's place"; and the Talmud adding that "the
 evil Spirit, Satan, and Samael, the angel of Death, are the same"
 --(<em>Babba Battra, 16a</em>)<em> </em>-- it becomes easy to
 see that Jehovah (<em>mankind, or</em> "Jah-hovah")
 and Satan (therefore the tempting Serpent) are one and

 * Dozens of the most erudite writers have sifted thoroughly the
 various meanings of the name J'hovah (with, and without the masoretic
 points), and shown their multifarious bearings. The best of such
 works is the "Source of Measures, the Hebrew Egyptian Mystery."
 </p><p>
 ** In the above-mentioned work (p. 233 App.), verse 26 of the
 4th chap. of Genesis is correctly translated "then men began
 to call themselves <em>Jehovah,</em>"<em> </em>but less correctly
 explained, perhaps, as the last word ought to be written <em>Jah</em>
 (<em>male</em>) <em>Hovah </em>(female), to show that from that
 time the race of distinctly separate man and woman began.

 <p>
 the same in every particular. <em>There is no Devil, no Evil,
 outside mankind</em> <em>to produce a Devil. </em>Evil is a necessity
 in, and one of the supporters of the manifested universe. It is
 a necessity for progress and evolution, as night is necessary
 for the production of Day, and Death for that of Life -- <em>that
 man may live for ever.</em> 
 </p><p>
 Satan represents metaphysically simply the <em>reverse or the
 polar opposite </em>of everything in nature.* He is the "adversary,"
 allegorically, the "murderer," and the great Enemy of
 <em>all</em>, because there is nothing in the whole universe that
 has not two sides -- the reverses of the same medal. But in that
 case, light, goodness, beauty, etc., may be called Satan with
 as much propriety as the Devil, since they are the <em>adversaries
 </em>of darkness, badness, and ugliness. And now the philosophy
 and the <em>rationale</em> of certain early Christian sects --
 called <em>heretical </em>and viewed as the abomination of the
 times -- will become more comprehensible. We may understand how
 it was that the sect of <strong>S</strong>ATANIANS came to be
 degraded, and were anathematized without any hope of vindication
 in a future day, since they kept their tenets secret. How, on
 the same principle, the <strong>C</strong>AINITES came to be degraded,
 and even the (Judas) <strong>I</strong>SCARIOTES; the true character
 of the <em>treacherous </em>apostle having never been correctly
 presented before the tribunal of Humanity.
 </p><p>
 As a direct consequence, the tenets of the Gnostic sects also
 become clear. Each of these sects was founded by an Initiate,
 while their tenets were based on the correct knowledge of the
 symbolism of every nation. Thus it becomes comprehensible why
 Ilda-Baoth was regarded by most of them as the god of Moses, and
 was held as a proud, ambitious, and impure spirit, who had abused
 his power by usurping the place of the <em>highest God, </em>though
 he was no better, and in some respects far worse than <em>his
 brethren Elohim</em>;<em> </em>the latter representing the all-embracing,
 manifested deity only in their collectivity, since they were the
 fashioners of the first differentiations of the primary Cosmic
 substance for the creation of the phenomenal Universe. Therefore
 Jehovah was called by the Gnostics the Creator of, and one with
 Ophiomorphos, the Serpent, Satan, or <strong>EVIL</strong><em>.
 </em>(<em>See </em>"<em>Isis Unveiled,</em>"<em> </em><strong>II,</strong><em>
 </em>184). They taught that Turbo and Adonai were "names
 of Jao-Jehovah, who is an emanation of Ilda Baoth" (<em>Codex
 Nazaraeus</em>)<em>. </em>(<em>See Part II., </em>"<em>The
 Fallen</em> <em>Angels.</em>") This amounted in their language
 to saying what the Rabbins expressed in a more veiled way, by
 stating that -- "Cain had been generated by Samael or Satan."

 * In Demonology, Satan is the leader of the opposition in Hell,
 the monarch of which was Beelzebub. He belongs to the fifth kind
 or class of demons (of which there are nine according to mediaeval
 demonology), and he is at the head of witches and sorcerers. But
 see in the text the true meaning of Baphomet, the goat-headed
 Satan, one with Azaziel, the scape goat of Israel. Nature is the
 god <strong>PAN. </strong></p><hr>

 The fallen Angels are made in every ancient system the prototypes
 of <em>fallen </em>men -- allegorically, and, <em>those men themselves
 -- </em>esoterically. Thus the Elohim of the hour of creation
 became the "Beni-Elohim," the sons of God, among whom
 is Satan -- in the Semitic traditions; war in heaven between Thraetaona
 and Azhi-dahaka, the destroying Serpent, ends on earth, according
 to Burnouf, in the battle of pious men against the power of Evil,
 "of the Iranians with the Aryan Brahmins of India."
 And the conflict of the gods with the <em>Asuras </em>is repeated
 in the Great War -- the Mahabharata. In the latest religion of
 all, Christianity, all the Combatants, gods and demons, adversaries
 in both the camps, are now transformed into Dragons and Satans,
 simply in order to connect <strong>EVIL</strong><em> </em>personified
 with the Serpent of Genesis, and thus prove the new dogma.*

 It matters little whether it is Isis, or Ceres -- the "Kabiria"
 -- or again the Kabiri, who have taught men agriculture; but it
 is very important to prevent fanatics from monopolising all the
 facts in history and legend, and from fathering their distortions
 of truth, history, and legend upon one man. Noah is either a <em>myth
 </em>along with the others, or one whose legend was built upon
 the Kabirian or Titanic tradition, as taught in Samothrace; he
 has, therefore, no claim to be monopolized by either Jew or Christian.
 If, as Faber tried to demonstrate at such cost of learning and
 research, Noah is an Atlantean and a Titan, and his family are
 the Kabiri or pious Titans, etc. -- then biblical chronology falls
 by its own weight, and along with it all the patriarchs -- the
 antediluvian and pre-Atlantean Titans. As now discovered and proven,
 Cain is Mars, the god of <em>power and generation, </em>and of
 the first (sexual) bloodshed.** Tubal-Cain is a Kabir, "an
 instructor of every artificer in brass and iron"; or -- if
 this will please better -- he is one with Hephaestos or Vulcan;
 Jabal is taken from the Kabiri -- instructors in agriculture,
 "such as have cattle," and Jubal is "the father
 of all those who handle the harp," he, or <em>they </em>who
 fabricated the <em>harp </em>for Kronos and the trident for Poseidon.***

 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 391 THE FLOOD LEGENDS.</h6>
 
 <p>
 The history or "fables" about the mysterious Telchines
 -- fables echoing each and all the archaic events of our esoteric
 teachings -- furnish us with a key to the origin of <em>Cain</em>'<em>s</em>
 genealogy (<em>Genesis, </em>ch. iii.); they give the reason why
 the Roman Catholic Church identifies "the accursed blood"
 of Cain and Ham with Sorcery, and makes it responsible for the
 Deluge. Were not the Telchines -- it is argued -- the mysterious
 ironworkers of Rhodes; they who were the first to raise statues
 to the gods, furnish them with weapons, and men with magic arts?
 And is it not they who were destroyed by a deluge at the command
 of Zeus, as the <em>Cainites </em>were by that of Jehovah?
 </p><p>
 The Telchines are simply the Kabiri and the Titans, in another
 form. They are the Atlanteans also. "Like Lemnos and Samothrace,"
 says Decharme, "Rhodes, the birth-place of the Telchines,
 is an island of volcanic formation." (<em>Genii of Fire,
 p. </em>271.) The island of Rhodes emerged suddenly out of the
 seas, after having been previously engulfed by the Ocean, say
 the traditions. Like Samothrace (of the Kabiri) it is connected
 in the memory of men with the Flood legends. As enough has been
 said on this subject, however, it may be left for the present.
 </p><p>
 But we may add a few more words about Noah, the Jewish representative
 of nearly every pagan God in one or another character. The Homeric
 songs contain, poetized, all the later fables about the Patriarchs,
 who are all sidereal, cosmic, and numerical symbols and signs.
 The attempt to disconnect the two genealogies -- those of Seth
 and Cain* -- and the further attempt, as futile, to show them
 <em>real, historical </em>men, has only led to more serious inquiries
 into the history of the Past, and to discoveries which have damaged
 for ever the supposed <em>revelation. </em>For instance, the identity
 of Noah and Melchizedek being established, the further identity
 of Melchizedek, or Father Sadik, with Kronos-Saturn is proved
 also.
 </p><p>
 That it is so may be easily demonstrated. It is not denied by
 any of the Christian writers. Bryant (<em>See </em>"<em>Analysis
 of Ancient Mythology,</em>"<em> Vol.</em> <em>II., p. </em>760)
 concurs with all those who are of opinion, that Sydic, or
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * Nothing could be more awkward and childish, we say, than this
 fruitless attempt to disconnect the genealogies of Cain and of
 Seth, or to conceal the identity of names under a different spelling.
 Thus, Cain has a Son <strong>E</strong>NOCH, and Seth a Son <strong>E</strong>NOCH
 also (Enos, Ch'anoch, Hanoch; -- one may do what one likes with
 Hebrew unvowelled names). In the Cainite line Enoch begets <strong>I</strong>RAD,
 Irad <strong>M</strong>EHUJAEL, the latter <strong>M</strong>ETHUSAEL,
 and Methusael, Lamech. In the Sethite line, Enoch begets Cainan,
 and this one <strong>M</strong>AHALEEL (a variation on Mehujael),
 who gives birth to <strong>J</strong>ARAD (or Irad); Jarad to
 <strong>E</strong>NOCH (Number 3), who produces Methuselah (from
 Methusael), and finally Lamech closes the list. Now all these
 are symbols (Kabalistically) of solar and lunar years, of astronomical
 periods, and of physiological (phallic) functions, just as in
 any other pagan symbolical creed. This has been proven by a number
 of writers.</p><hr>

 Sadic, was the patriarch Noah (as also Melchizedek); and that
 the name by which he is called, or Sadic, corresponds to the character
 given of him<em> </em>in <em>Genesis, </em>chap. vi., 9. "He
 was <img src="sd2-392.gif" align="BOTTOM">, Sadic, a JUST man,
 and perfect in his generation. All science and every useful art
 were attributed to him, and through his sons transmitted to posterity."<em>
 </em>(<em>See New Encyclopaedia</em> <em>by Abraham Rees, </em><strong>F.R.S</strong><em>.</em>)
 </p><p>
 Now it is Sanchoniathon, who informs the world that the Kabiri
 were the Sons of Sydic or Zedek (Melchizedek). True enough, this
 information, having descended to us through Eusebius (<em>Preparatio
 Evangelica</em>), may be regarded with a certain amount of suspicion,
 as it is more than likely that he dealt with Sanchoniathon's works
 as he has with Manetho's Synchronistic Tables. But let us suppose
 that the identification of Sydic, Kronos, or Saturn with Noah
 and Melchizedek, is based on one of the Eusebian pious hypotheses.
 Let us accept it as such, along with Noah's characteristic as
 a <em>just man, </em>and his supposed duplicate, the mysterious
 Melchizedek, King of Salem, and priest of the high god, after
 "his own order" (<em>See Hebrews, ch. v</em>. 6, <em>and
 vii. 1, et seq.</em>);<em> </em>and finally, having seen what
 they all were spiritually, astronomically, psychically and cosmically,
 let us now see what they became <em>rabbinically </em>and <strong>K</strong>ABALISTICALLY.
 </p><p>
 Speaking of Adam, Kain, Mars, etc., as <em>personifications, </em>we
 find the author of "<em>The Source of Measures</em>"<em>
 </em>enunciating our very esoteric teachings in his Kabalistic
 researches. Thus he says: --
 </p><blockquote>
 "Now Mars was the lord of <i>birth </i>and of <i>death, </i>of
 <i>generation </i>and of <i>destruction, </i>of<i> ploughing,</i>
 of<i> building,</i> of <i>sculpture </i>or stone-cutting, of <i>Architecture
 </i>. . . . in fine, of all . . . . ARTS. He was the <i>primeval
 principle,</i> disintegrating into the modification of <i>two
 opposites for production. </i>Astronomically, too,* he held the
 birthplace of the day and year, the place of its <i>increase of
 strength, Aries, </i>and likewise the place of its death, Scorpio.
 He held the house of <i>Venus, </i>and that of the <i>Scorpion.
 </i>He, as <i>birth, </i>was<i> good;</i> as<i> death, </i>was<i>
 </i>Evil<i>. </i>As <i>good, </i>he was <i>light; </i>as<i> bad,
 </i>he was <i>night. </i>As<i> good,</i> he was <i>man</i>; as<i>
 bad, </i>he was <i>woman. </i>He held the cardinal points, and
 as <i>Cain</i>, or <i>Vulcan,</i>**<i> </i>or <i>Pater Sadic,
 </i>or<i> Melchizadek, </i>he was lord of the <i>Ecliptic, </i>or
 </blockquote>
 
 <h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * The AEolian name of Mars was [[<em>Areus</em>]], and the Greek
 Ares, [[<em>Ares</em>]], is a name over the etymological significance
 of which, philologists and Indianists, Greek and Sanskrit scholars
 have vainly worked to this day. Very strangely, Max Muller connects
 both the names <em>Mars</em> and<em> Ares </em>with the Sanskrit
 root <em>mar</em>, whence he traces their derivation, and from
 which, he says, the name of <em>Maruts </em>(the storm-gods) comes.
 Welcker, however, offers more correct etymologies. (<em>See Griech.
 Gotterlehre, I., </em>415.) However it may be, etymologies of
 roots and words alone will never yield the esoteric meaning fully,
 though they may help to useful guesses.
 </p><p>
 ** As the same author shows: "The very name Vulcain appears
 in the reading; for in the first words (of chap. iv. <em>Genesis,
 5</em>)<em> </em>is to be found V'elcain, or V'ulcain, agreeably
 to the deepened <em>u </em>sound of the letter<em> vau</em>. Out
 of its immediate context, it may be [[Footnote continued on next

 <blockquote>
 <i>balance, </i>or<i> line of adjustment, </i>and therefore was
 THE JUST ONE. The ancients held to there being seven planets,
 or great gods, growing out of eight, and Pater Sadik, <i>the Just

 ("Source of Measures," p. 186-70.)
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 This makes their functions plain enough after they had been degraded,
 and establishes the identity.
 </p><p>
 The<em> Noachian </em>Deluge, as described in its dead letter
 and within the period of Biblical chronology, having been shown
 to have never existed, the pious, but very arbitrary supposition
 of Bishop Cumberland has but to follow that deluge into the land
 of fiction. Indeed it seems rather fanciful to any impartial observer
 to be told that there were "two distinct races of Kabiri,"
 the first consisting of Ham and Mizraim, whom he conceives to
 be Jupiter and Dionysus of Mnaseas; the second, "of the children
 of Shem, are the Kabiri of Sochoniston, while their father Sydyk
 is consequently the Scriptural Shem." (<em>Append. de Cabiris,
 ap.</em> <em>Orig. gent. p. </em>364, 376, <em>and the latter
 statement on p. </em>357.)
 </p><p>
 The Kabirim, "the mighty ones," are identical with our
 primeval Dhyan-Chohans, with the corporeal and the incorporeal
 Pitris, and with all the rulers and instructors of the primeval
 races, which are referred to as the Gods and Kings of the divine
 Dynasties.

 Legendary lore could not distort facts so effectually as to reduce
 them to unrecognisable shape. Between the traditions of Egypt
 and Greece on the one hand, and Persia on the other -- a country
 ever at war with the former -- there is too great a similarity
 of figures and numbers to allow such coincidence to be due to
 simple chance. This was well proven by Bailly. Let us pause for
 a moment to examine these traditions from every available source,
 to compare the better those of the Magi with the so-called Grecian
 "fables."
 </p><p>
 Those legends have now passed into popular tales, the folklore
 of Persia, as many a real fiction has found its way into our universal
 History. The stories of King Arthur and his knights of the Round
 Table are also fairy tales to all appearance; yet they are based
 on facts, and pertain to the History of England. Why should not
 the folklore of Iran be part and parcel of the history and the
 pre-historic events of Atlantis? That folklore says as follows:

 [[Continued from previous page]] read as "<em>and the god

 wanting to confirm the Cain-Vulcain idea, Fuerst says: <img src="sd2-394.gif" align="BOTTOM">,

 <p>
 Before the creation of <em>Adam, </em>two races lived and succeeded
 each other on Earth; the Devs who reigned 7,000 years, and the
 Peris (the Izeds) who reigned but 2,000, during the existence
 of the former. The Devs were giants, strong and wicked; the Peris
 were smaller in stature, but wiser and kinder.
 </p><p>
 Here we recognize the Atlantean giants and the Aryans, or the
 Rakshasas of the Ramayana and the children of Bharata Varsha,
 or India; the ante- and the post-diluvians of the Bible.
 </p><p>
 Gyan (or rather Gnan, true or occult Wisdom and knowledge), also
 called <em>Gian-ben-Gian </em>(or Wisdom, son of Wisdom), was
 the king of the Peris.* He had a shield as famous as that of Achilles,
 only instead of serving against an enemy in war, it served as
 a protection against black magic, the <em>sorcery </em>of the
 Devs. Gian-ben-Gian had reigned 2,000 years when <em>Iblis, </em>the
 devil, was permitted by God to defeat the Devs and scatter them
 to the other end of the world. Even the magic shield, which, produced
 on the principles of astrology, destroyed charms, enchantments,
 and bad spells, could not prevail against <em>Iblis, </em>who
 was an agent of Fate (or Karma).** They count ten kings in their
 last metropolis called Khanoom, and make the tenth, Kaimurath,
 identical with the Hebrew Adam. These kings answer to the ten
 antediluvian generations of kings as given by Berosus.
 </p><p>
 Distorted as those legends are now found, one can hardly fail
 to identify them with the Chaldean, Egyptian, Greek, and even
 Hebrew traditions. The latter, disdaining in its exclusiveness
 to speak of pre-adamite nations, yet allows these to be clearly
 inferred, by sending out Cain -- <em>one of the two only living
 men on earth </em>-- into the land of Nod, where he gets married
 and builds a city (<em>Gen. iv.</em>), etc.
 </p><p>
 Now if we compare the 9,000 years mentioned by the Persian tales
 with the 9,000 years, which Plato declared had passed since the
 submersion of the last Atlantis, a very strange fact is made apparent.
 Bailly remarked, but distorted it by his interpretation. The Secret
 Doctrine may restore the figures to their true meaning. "First
 of all," we read in "Critias" that "one must
 remember that 9,000 years have elapsed <em>since the war of the
 nations, </em>which lived above and outside the Pillars of Hercules,
 and those which peopled the lands on this side."

 In<em> </em>"<em>Timaeus</em>"<em> </em>Plato says the
 same. The Secret Doctrine declaring that most of the later islander
 Atlanteans perished in the interval between 850,000 and 700,000
 years ago, and that the Aryans were 200,000 years old when the
 first great "island" or continent was submerged, there
 hardly seems any reconciliation possible between the figures.
 But there is, in truth. Plato, being an Initiate, had to use the
 veiled language of the Sanctuary, and so had the Magi of Chaldea
 and Persia, through whose exoteric revelations the Persian legends
 were preserved and passed to posterity. Thus, one finds the Hebrews
 calling a week "seven days," and "a week of years"
 when each of its days represents 360 solar years, and the whole
 "week" is 2,520 years, in fact. They had a Sabbatical
 week, a Sabbatical year, etc., etc., and their Sabbath lasted
 indifferently 24 hours or 24,000 years -- in their secret calculations
 of the Sods. We of the present times call an age <em>a century.
 </em>They of Plato's day, the initiated writers, at any rate,
 meant by a millenium, not a thousand but 100,000 years; Hindus,
 more independent than any, never concealed their chronology. Thus,
 when saying 9,000 years, the Initiates will read 900,000 years,
 during which space of time -<em>- i.e</em>, from the first appearance
 of the Aryan race, when the Pliocene portions of the once great
 Atlantis began gradually sinking* and other continents to appear
 on the surface, down to the final disappearance of Plato's small
 island of Atlantis, the Aryan races had never ceased to fight
 with the descendants of the first giant races. This war lasted
 till nearly the close of the age which preceded the Kali Yug,
 and was the Mahabharatean war so famous in Indian History. Such
 blending of the events and epochs, and the bringing down of hundreds
 of thousands into thousands of years, does not interfere with
 the numbers of years that had elapsed, according to the statement
 made by the Egyptian priests to Solon, since the destruction of
 the last portion of Atlantis. The 9,000 years were the correct
 figures given. The latter event has never been kept a secret,
 and had only faded out of the memory of the Greeks. The Egyptians
 had their records complete, because isolated; for, being surrounded
 by sea and desert, they had been left untrammelled by other nations,
 till about a few millenniums before our era.

 History, for the first time, catches a glimpse of Egypt and its
 great mysteries through Herodotus, if we do not take into account
 the Bible, and its queer chronology.** And how little Herodotus
 <em>could </em>tell is

 ** From Bede downwards all the chronologists of the Church have
 differed among themselves, and contradicted each other. "The
 chronology of the Hebrew text has been grossly altered, especially
 in the interval next after the Deluge": -- says Whiston (<em>Old
 Test., p. </em>20).</p><hr>

 confessed by himself when speaking of a mysterious tomb of an
 Initiate at Sais, in the sacred precinct of Minerva. There, he
 says "behind the chapel . . . is the tomb of One, <em>whose
 name I consider it impious to</em> <em>divulge </em>. . . In the
 enclosure stand large obelisks and there is a <em>lake</em> near,
 surrounded with a stone wall formed <em>in a circle. </em>In this
 lake they perform by night, that person's adventures, which they
 call <em>Mysteries:</em> on these matters, however, though I am
 accurately acquainted with the particulars of them, <em>I must
 observe a discreet silence</em>" (<em>ii. </em>170).
 </p><p>
 On the other hand, it is well to know that no secret was so well
 preserved and so sacred with the ancients, as that of their cycles
 and computations. From the Egyptians down to the Jews it was held
 as the highest sin to divulge anything pertaining to the correct
 measure of time. It was for divulging <em>the secrets of the Gods,
 </em>that Tantalus was plunged into the infernal regions; the
 keepers of the sacred Sibylline Books were threatened with the
 death penalty for revealing a word from them. Sigalions (images
 of Harpocrates) were in every temple -- especially in those of
 Isis and Serapis -- each pressing a finger to the lips; while
 the Hebrews taught that to divulge, after initiation into the
 Rabbinical mysteries, the secrets of Kabala, was like eating of
 the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge: it was punishable by death.
 </p><p>
 And yet, we Europeans accepted the exoteric chronology of the
 Jews! What wonder that it has influenced and coloured ever since
 all our conceptions of science and the duration of things!
 </p><p>
 The Persian traditions, then, are full of two nations or races,
 now entirely extinct, as some think; whereas, they are only transformed.
 They are ever speaking of, and describing the mountains of Kaf
 (Kafaristan?), which contain a gallery built by the giant Argeak,
 wherein the statues of the ancient men under all their forms are
 preserved. They call them <em>Sulimans </em>(Solomons), or the
 wise kings of the East, and count seventy-two kings of that name.*
 Three among them reigned for 1,000 years each. (<em>Herbelot,
 p. </em>829.)
 </p><p>
 Siamek, the beloved son of Kaimurath (Adam), their first king,
 died murdered by his giant brother. The father had a perpetual
 fire preserved on the tomb which contained his cremated ashes;
 hence -- the origin of fire-worship, as some Orientalists think.
 </p><p>
 Then came <em>Huschenk, </em>the prudent and the wise. It was
 his dynasty which re-discovered metals and precious stones, which
 had been concealed by the Devs or Giants in the bowels of the
 earth; how to make brass-work, to cut canals, and improve agriculture.
 As usual, it is Huschenk, again, who is credited with having written
 the work called

 of the Bible, and the description of whose magnificent palace

 were unknown to all pagan travellers, even to Herodotus.</p><hr>

 "Eternal Wisdom," and even with having built the cities
 of Luz, Babylon and Ispahan, though they were built ages later.
 But as modern Delhi is built on six other older cities, so these
 just-named cities may be built on emplacements of other cities
 of an immense antiquity. As to his date, it can only be inferred
 from another legend.
 </p><p>
 In the same tradition that wise prince is credited with having
 made war against the giants on a twelve-legged horse, whose birth
 is attributed to the <em>amours </em>of a crocodile with a female
 hippopotamus. This <em>dodecaped </em>was found on the "dry
 island" or new continent; much force and cunning had to be
 used to secure the wonderful animal, but no sooner had Huschenk
 mounted him, than he defeated every enemy. No giants could withstand
 his tremendous power. Notwithstanding, this king of kings was
 killed by an enormous rock thrown at him by the giants from the
 great mountains of <em>Damavend.</em>*
 </p><p>
 Tahmurath is the third king of Persia, the St. George of Iran,
 the knight who always has the best of, and who kills, the Dragon.
 He is the great enemy of the Devs who, in his day, dwelled in
 the mountains of Kaf, and occasionally made raids on the Peris.
 The old French chronicles of the Persian folklore call him the
 <em>Dev-bend, </em>the conqueror of the giants. He, too, is credited
 with having founded Babylon, Nineveh, Diarbek, etc., etc. Like
 his grand-sire Huschenk, Tahmurath (Taimuraz) also had his steed,
 only far more rare and rapid -- a bird called <em>Simorgh-Anke.
 </em>A marvellous bird, in truth, intelligent, a polyglot, and
 even very religious. (<em>See Orient. Collect. ii., </em>119.)
 What says that Persian Phoenix? It complains of its old age, for
 it is born cycles and cycles before the days of Adam (also Kaimurath).
 It has witnessed the revolutions of long centuries. It has seen
 the birth and the close of twelve cycles of 7,000 years each,
 which multiplied esoterically will give us again 840,000 years.**
 (<em>Orient. Collect. ii., 119 et seq</em>.) Simorgh is born with
 the last deluge of the pre-Adamites, says the "romance of
 Simorgh and the good Khalif"! (<em>Tales of Derbent.</em>)
 </p><p>
 What says the "Book of Numbers"? Esoterically, Adam
 Rishoon is the lunar Spirit (Jehovah, in a sense, or the Pitris)
 and his three Sons -- Ka-yin, Habel, and Seth -- represent the
 three races, as already explained. Noah-Xisuthrus represents in
 his turn (in the cosmo-geological key) the 3rd Race separated,
 and his three sons, its last three races; Ham, moreover, symbolizing
 that race which uncovered the "<em>nakedness</em>" of
 the Parent Race, and of the "Mindless," <em>i.e.</em>,
 committed sin.

 Tahmurath visits on his winged steed (Ahriman) the Mountains of
 Koh-Kaf or <em>Kaph. </em>He finds there the Peris ill-treated
 by the giants, and slays Argen, and the giant <em>Demrusch. </em>Then
 he liberates the good Peri, Mergiana*, whom Demrusch had kept
 as a prisoner, and takes her over to the <em>dry</em> island,<em>
 i.e.</em>, the new continent of Europe.** After him came Giamschid,
 who builds <em>Esikekar, </em>or Persepolis. This king reigns
 700 years, and believes himself, in his great pride, immortal,
 and demands divine honours. Fate punishes him, he wanders for
 100 years in the world under the name of <em>Dhulkarnayn </em>"the
 two horned." But this epithet has no connection with the
 "two-horned" gentleman of the cloven foot. The "two-horned"
 is the epithet given in Asia, uncivilized enough to know nothing
 of the attributes of the devil, to those conquerors who have subdued
 the world from the East to the West.
 </p><p>
 Then come the usurper <em>Zohac, </em>and Feridan, one of the
 Persian heroes, who vanquishes the former, and shuts him up in
 the mountains of Damavend. These are followed by many others down
 to <em>Kaikobad,</em> who founded a new dynasty.
 </p><p>
 Such is the legendary history of Persia, and we have to analyze
 it. What are the mountains of <em>Kaf </em>to begin with?
 </p><p>
 Whatever they may be in their geographical status, whether they
 are the Caucasian or Central Asian mountains, it is far beyond
 these mountains to the North, that legend places the Devs and
 Peris; the latter the remote ancestors of the Parses or Farses.
 Oriental tradition is ever referring to an unknown glacial, gloomy
 sea, and to a dark region, within which, nevertheless, are situated
 <em>the Fortunate Islands, </em>wherein bubbles, from the beginning
 of life on earth, the <em>fountain of life </em>(<em>Herbelot,
 p. 593</em>;<em> Armenian Tales, p. 35</em>)<em>. </em>But the
 legend asserts, moreover, that a portion of the first <em>dry</em>
 island (continent), having detached itself from the main body,
 has remained, since then, beyond the mountains of Koh-kaf, "the
 stony girdle that surrounds the world." A journey of seven
 months' duration will bring him who is possessed of "Soliman's
 ring" to that "fountain," if he keeps on journeying
 North straight before him as the bird flies. Journeying therefore
 from Persia <em>straight north, </em>will bring one along the
 sixtieth degree of longitude, holding to the west, to Nova Zemblia;
 and from the Caucasus to the eternal ice beyond the Arctic circle
 would land one between 60 and 45 degrees of longitude, or between
 Nova Zemblia and Spitzbergen. This, of course, if one has the
 dodecapedian horse of

 Huschenk or the winged Simorgh of Tahmurath (or Taimuraz), upon
 which to cross over the Arctic Ocean.*
 </p><p>
 Nevertheless, the wandering songsters of Persia and the Caucasus
 will maintain, to this day, that far beyond the snow-capped summits
 of Kap, or Caucasus, <em>there is a great continent now concealed
 from all. </em>That it is reached by those who can secure the
 services of the twelvelegged progeny of the crocodile and the
 female hippopotamus, whose legs become at will <em>twelve wings</em>**;<em>
 </em>or by those who have the patience to wait for the good pleasure
 of <em>Simorgh-anke, </em>who promised that before she dies she
 will reveal the hidden continent to all, and make it once more
 visible and within easy reach, by means of a bridge, which the
 Ocean Devs will build between that portion of the "dry island"
 and its severed parts.*** This relates, of course, to the seventh
 race, Simorgh being the Manvantaric cycle.
 </p><p>
 It is very curious that Cosmas Indicopleustes, who lived in the
 sixth century <strong>A.D</strong>., should have always maintained
 that man was born, and dwelt at first in a country <em>beyond
 the Ocean, </em>a proof of which had been given him in India,
 by a learned Chaldean (<em>Cosmas Indicopleustes in</em> <em>Collect.
 nova Patrum, t</em>.<em> ii, p. </em>188;<em> also see Journ</em>.
 <em>des Savants, Suppl.</em> 1707, <em>p. </em>20.) <em>He says:
 </em>"<em>The lands we live </em>in <em>are surrounded by
 the ocean,</em> <em>but beyond that ocean there is another land
 which touches the walls of the</em> <em>sky</em>;<em> and it is</em>
 <em>in this land that man was created and lived in paradise.</em>
 <em>During the Deluge, Noah was carried in his ark</em> <em>into
 the land his posterity</em> <em>now inhabits.</em>" (<em>Ibid.</em>)<em>
 </em>The twelve-legged horse of Huschenk was found on that continent
 named the <em>dry </em>island. (<em>Supra, p.</em> 154.)
 </p><p>
 The "Christian topography" of Cosmas Indicopleustes
 and its merits are well known; but here the good father repeats
 a universal tradition, now, moreover, corroborated by facts. Every
 arctic traveller suspects a continent or a "dry island"
 beyond the line of eternal ice. Perhaps now the meaning of the
 following passage from one of the Commentaries may become clearer.

 * To this day the aborigines of Caucasus speak of their mountains
 as Kap-kaz, using the consonant p instead of the usual v (Kavkaz
 or Caucasus). But their bards say that it requires seven months
 for a swift horse to reach the "dry land" beyond Kaf,
 holding north without ever deviating from one's way.
 </p><p>
 ** Bailly thought he saw in this horse a twelve-oared ship. The
 Secret Doctrine teaches that the early Third Race built boats
 and flotillas before it built houses. But the "horse,"
 though a much later animal, has, nevertheless, a more occult primitive
 meaning. The crocodile and the hippopotamus were held sacred and
 represented divine symbols, both with the ancient Egyptians and
 with the Mexicans. Poseidon is, in Homer, the God of the Horse,
 and assumes that form himself to please Ceres. Arion, their progeny,
 is one of the aspects of that "horse," which is a cycle.

 "<em>In the first beginnings of </em>(human) <em>life, the
 only dry land was on the</em> <em>Right end</em>*<em> of the sphere,
 where it </em>(the globe) <em>is motionless.</em>**<em> The whole</em>
 <em>earth was one vast watery desert, and the waters were tepid
 </em>. . . . <em>There</em> <em>man was born on the seven zones
 of the immortal, the indestructible of the</em> <em>Manvantara.</em>***<em>
 There was eternal spring in darkness.</em> (But)<em> that which
 is</em> <em>darkness to the man of today, was light to the man
 of his dawn. There,</em> <em>the gods rested, and Fohat</em>****<em>
 reigns ever since </em>. . . . <em>Thus the wise fathers</em>
 <em>say that man is born in the head of his mother </em>(earth)<em>,
 and that her feet</em> <em>at the left end generated </em>(begot)<em>
 the evil winds that blow from the mouth</em> <em>of the lower
 Dragon </em>. . . . <em>Between the first and second </em>(races)
 <em>the</em> <em>eternal central </em>(land) <em>was divided by
 the water of life.</em>*****

 "<em>It flows around and animates her </em>(mother earth's)

 </em>(in the beginnings) <em>was not yet</em> <em>born. For it
 is in the belt of man</em>'<em>s dwelling </em>(the earth) <em>that
 lies concealed the life and health of all that lives and breathes.</em>******<em>
 During the first</em> <em>and second </em>(races)<em> the belt
 was covered with the great waters. </em>(But) <em>the</em> <em>great
 mother travailed under the waves and a new land was joined to</em>

 * The two poles are called the right and left ends of our globe
 -- the right being the North Pole -- or the head and feet of the
 earth. Every beneficent (astral and cosmic) action comes from
 the North; every lethal influence from the South Pole. They are
 much connected with and influence "<em>right</em>"<em>
 and </em>"<em>left</em>"<em> hand magic.</em> 
 </p><p>
 ** The more one approaches the poles the less rotation is felt;
 at the <em>poles </em>proper, the diurnal revolution is quite
 neutralized. Thence the expression that the sphere is "motionless."
 </p><p>
 *** It is averred in Occultism that the land or island, which
 crowns the North Pole like a skull-cap, is the only one which
 prevails during the whole Manvantara of our "Round."
 All the central continents and lands will emerge from the sea
 bottom many times in turn, but this land will never change.
 </p><p>
 **** Bear in mind that the Vedic and Avestian name of Fohat is
 Apam-Napat. In the Avesta he stands between the <em>fire-yazatas
 </em>and the <em>water-yazatas. </em>The literal meaning is "Son
 of the Waters," but these "waters" are not the
 liquid we know, but Ether -- the fiery waters of space. Fohat
 is the "Son of Ether" in its highest aspect, Akasa,
 the Mother-Father of the primitive Seven, and of <em>Sound </em>or
 <strong>L</strong>OGOS. Fohat is the <em>light </em>of the latter.
 See Book I.
 </p><p>
 ***** This "water" is the blood or fluid of life which
 animates the earth, compared here to a living body.
 </p><p>
 ****** Occult teaching corroborates the popular tradition which
 asserts the existence of a fountain of life in the bowels of the
 earth and in the North Pole. It is the blood of the earth, the
 electromagnetic current, which circulates through all the arteries;
 and which is said to be found stored in the "navel"
 of the earth.</p><hr>

 <em>water. It was the belt, the sacred Himavat, which stretches
 around</em> <em>the world.</em>*<em> She broke toward the setting
 sun from her neck*</em>*<em> downward</em> (to the south west),
 <em>into many lands and islands, but the eternal land</em> (the
 cap) <em>broke not asunder. Dry lands covered the face of the
 silent</em> <em>waters to the four sides of the world. All these
 perished </em>(in their turn). <em>Then appeared the abode of
 the wicked </em>(the Atlantis). <em>The eternal land</em> <em>was
 now hid, for the waters became solid </em>(frozen)<em> under the
 breath of</em> <em>her nostrils and the evil winds from the Dragon</em>'<em>s

 </p><p>
 This shows that Northern Asia is as old as the Second Race. One
 may even say that Asia is contemporary with man, since from the
 very beginnings of human life its <em>root</em>-continent, so
 to speak, already existed; that part of the world now known as
 Asia being only cut off from it in a later age, and divided by
 the glacial waters.
 </p><p>
 If, then, the teaching is understood correctly, the first continent
 which came into existence capped over the whole North Pole like
 one unbroken crust, and remains so to this day, beyond that inland
 sea which seemed like an unreachable <em>mirage to the few </em>arctic
 travellers who perceived it.

 * Occultism points to the Himalayan chain as that "belt,"
 and maintains that whether under the water or above, it encircles
 the globe. The <em>navel</em> is described as situated to the
 setting sun or to the west of the Himavat in which lie the roots
 of Meru, which mountain is north of the Himalaya. Meru is <em>not
 </em>"the fabulous mountain in the navel or centre of the
 earth," but its roots and foundations are in that navel,
 though it is in the far north itself. This connects it with the
 "central" land "that never perishes"; the
 land in which "the day of the mortal lasts six months and
 his night another six months." As the Vishnu Purana has it:
 "for the North of Meru there is, therefore, always night
 during day in <em>other regions</em>;<em> </em>for Meru is north
 of all the <em>dwipas </em>and<em> varshas</em>"<em> </em>(islands
 and countries). (<em>Book</em> <em>II., chap. viii.</em>)<em>
 </em>Meru is therefore neither on <em>Atlas </em>as Wilford suggests,
 nor, as Wilson tried to show, "absolutely in the centre of
 the globe," only because "relatively with the inhabitants
 of the several portions, to all of whom the East is that quarter
 where the sun first appears."
 </p><p>
 ** Even the Commentaries do not refrain from Oriental metaphor.
 The globe is likened to the body of a woman, "mother earth."
 From her neck downward, means from the inland sea now beyond the
 impassable barrier of ice. The Earth, as Parasara says: "is
 the mother and nurse, augmented with all creatures and <em>their</em>
 qualities, <em>the comprehender </em>of all the worlds."

 the commentary as <em>a place of no latitude </em>(niraksha) the
 abode of the gods. As a scholiast says from the <em>Surya-Sidhanta:</em>

 "Above this (the Siddha) goes the sun when situated at the
 equinoxes; they have neither equinoctial shadow nor elevation
 of the pole (<em>akshonnati, </em>v. 42). In both directions from
 these are two pole-stars (<em>dhruvatara</em>), fixed in the midst
