 <strong>T</strong>HE <strong>P</strong>RIMEVAL <strong>M</strong>ANUS
 OF <strong>H</strong>UMANITY.
 </p><p>
 Those who are aware that the "great Flood," which was
 connected with the sinking of an entire continent -- save what
 became a few islands -- could not have happened so far back as
 18,000,000 years ago; and that Vaivasvata Manu is the Indian Noah
 connected with the <em>Matsya </em>(or the fish) Avatar of Vishnu
 -- may feel perplexed at this discrepancy between facts stated
 and the chronology previously given. But there is no discrepancy
 in truth. The reader is asked to turn to the <em>Theosophist</em>
 of July, 1883, and after studying the article therein, "The
 Septenary Principle in Esotericism," the whole question can
 be explained to him. It is in this explanation, I believe, that
 the Occultists differ from the Brahmins.
 </p><p>
 For the benefit of those, however, who may not have "The
 Theosophist" of that month and year to hand, a passage or
 two may now be quoted from it:
 </p><blockquote>
 "Who was Manu, the son of Swayambhuva? The secret doctrine
 tells us that <i>this </i>Manu was no man, but the representation
 of the first human races evolved with the help of the Dhyan-Chohans
 (<i>Devas</i>) at the beginning of the first round. But we are
 told in his Laws (<i>Book I. </i>80) that there are fourteen Manus
 for every Kalpa -- or interval from creation to creation (read
 interval from one <i>minor</i> 'Pralaya' to another*) -- and that
 in the present divine age, there have been as yet <i>seven </i>Manus.
 Those who know that there are seven rounds, of which we have passed
 three, and are now in the fourth; and who are
 </blockquote>

 <p>
 * <em>Pralaya</em> -- a word already explained -- is not a term
 that applies <em>only </em>to every "Night of Brahma,"
 or the world's dissolution following every Manvantara, equal to
 71 Maha-yugas. It applies also to each "obscuration"
 as well, and even to every Cataclysm that puts an end, by Fire
 or by Water in turn, to each Root-Race. <em>Pralaya</em> is a
 term like that of "Manu" -- the generic name for the
 <em>Sishtas, </em>who, under the appellation of "King,"
 are shown in <em>the Puranas </em>as preserved "with the
 seed of all things in an ark from the waters of that flood"
 (or the fires of a general volcanic conflagration, the commencement
 of which we already see for our Fifth-Race in the terrible earthquakes
 and eruptions of these late years, and especially in the present
 one) . . . . which in the season of a pralaya overspreads the
 world" (the Earth). (<em>See Preface,</em> <em>p. lxxxi.</em>,
 to Wilson's "<em>Vishnu Purana.</em>") Time is only
 a form of "Vishnu" -- truly, as Parasara says in that
 Purana. In the Hindu Yuga Kalpa, we have the regular descending
 series 4, 3, 2, with ciphers multiplied as occasion requires for
 esoteric purposes, but not, as Wilson and other Orientalists thought,
 for "sectarian embellishments." A Kalpa may be an age,
 a "Day" of Brahma, or a sidereal Kalpa, astronomical
 and earthly. Those calculations are found in all the Puranas,
 but some differ -- as for instance, "the year of the seven
 Rishis, 3,030 mortal years, and the year of Dhruva, 9,090 in the
 Linga Purana," which are again esoteric, and which <em>do</em>
 represent actual (secret) chronology. As said in the <em>Brahma
 Vaivarta: </em>"Chronologers compute a Kalpa by the life
 of Brahma. <em>Minor </em>Kalpas, as Samvarta and the rest, are
 numerous." "<em>Minor</em> Kalpas" denote here
 every period of destruction, as was well understood by Wilson
 himself, who explains the latter as "those in which the Samvarta
 wind or other destructive agents operate" (<em>Vishnu Purana,
 p. </em>54<em>, vol. I</em>.). </p><hr>

 that, moreover, there are root-Manus, and what we have to clumsily

 scriptures that the first Manu produced <i>six</i> other Manus
 (<i>seven</i> primary Manus in all), and these produced in their
 turn each seven other Manus** (<i>Bhrigu I, </i>61-63) -- the
 production of the latter standing in the occult treatises as 7
 x 7. Thus it becomes clear that Manu -- the last one, the progenitor
 of our Fourth Round Humanity -- must be the <i>seventh, </i>since
 we are on our fourth Round,*** and there is a <i>root</i>-Manu
 at globe A and a <i>seed </i>Manu at globe G. Just as each planetary
 Round commences with the appearance of a 'Root Manu' (Dhyan Chohan)
 and closes with a 'Seed-Manu,' so a <i>Root </i>and a <i>Seed
 </i>Manu appear respectively at the beginning and the termination
 of the human period on any particular planet.**** It will be easily
 seen from the foregoing statement that a<i> Manu-antaric </i>period

 in Mr. Sinnett's "Esoteric Buddhism, "Fifth Edition.
 See in it <em>Annotations</em> -- the "Noah's Ark Theory"
 pp. 146, 147.
 </p><p>
 ** The fact that Manu himself is made to declare that he was created
 by Viraj, and that he then produced the ten Prajapatis, who again
 produced seven Manus, who in their turn gave birth to seven other
 Manus (<em>Manu, I, </em>33-36) relates to other still earlier
 mysteries, and is at the same time a <em>blind</em> with regard
 to the doctrine of the Septenary chain, and the simultaneous evolution
 of seven humanities, or <strong>M</strong>EN. However, the present
 work is written on the records of Cis-Himalayan Secret Teachings,
 and Brahmanical esoteric philosophy may now differ in form as
 the Kabala does. But they were identical in hoary antiquity.
 </p><p>
 *** There is another <em>esoteric </em>reason besides this one
 for it. A Vaivasvata is the <em>seventh </em>Manu, because this
 our Round, although the Fourth, is in the <em>preseptenary</em>
 Manvantara, and the Round itself is in its <em>seventh </em>stage
 of materiality or physicality. The close of its middle racial
 point occurred during the Fourth Root Race, when man and all nature
 reached their lowest state of gross matter. From that time, <em>i.e.</em>,
 from the end of the three and a half races, humanity and nature
 entered on the ascending arc of their racial cycle.
 </p><p>
 **** The interval that precedes each Yuga is called a <em>Sandhya,
 </em>composed of as many hundreds of years as there are thousands
 in the yuga; and that which follows the latter is named <em>Sandhyamsa,
 </em>and is of similar duration, we are told in <em>Vishnu Purana.
 </em>"The interval between the Sandhya and the Sandhyamsa
 is the yuga denominated Krita, Treta, etc., etc. The (four) Krita,
 Treta, Dwapara, and Kali constitute a great age, or aggregate
 of four ages: a 1000 such aggregates are a Day of Brahma; and
 14 <em>Manus</em> <em>reign within that term</em>." Now had
 we to accept this literally then there would be only one Manu
 for every 4,320,000,000 of years. As we are taught that it took
 300,000,000 of years for the two lower kingdoms to evolve, and
 that our humanity is just 18 and some odd millions old -- where
 were the other Manus spoken of, unless the allegory means what
 the esoteric doctrine teaches us about the 14 being each multiplied
 by 49.</p><hr>

 <blockquote>
 appearance of two Manus or Dhyan Chohans; and hence a minor <i>Manvantara</i>
 is the duration of the <i>seven </i>races on any particular planet,
 and a major manvantara is the period of one human round along
 the Planetary chain. Moreover, that, as it is said that each of
 the seven Manus <i>creates </i>7 x 7 Manus, and that there are
 49 root-races on the seven planets during each Round, then every
 root-race has its Manu. The present seventh Manu is called 'Vaivasvata'
 and stands in the exoteric texts for that Manu who represents
 in India the Babylonian Xisuthrus and the Jewish Noah. But in
 the esoteric books we are told that Manu Vaivasvata, the progenitor
 of our <i>Fifth </i>race -- who saved it from the flood that nearly
 exterminated the Fourth (Atlantis) -- is not the seventh Manu,
 mentioned in the nomenclature of the Root, or primitive-Manus,
 but one of the 49 Manus emanated from this Root-Manu.

 14 Manus in their respective order and relation to each Round:

 "Vaivasvata, thus, though seventh in the order given, is
 the primitive Root-Manu of our fourth Human Wave (the reader must
 always remember that Manu is not a man but collective humanity),
 while<i> our</i> Vaivasvata was but one of the seven <i>Minor
 </i>Manus, who are made to preside over the seven races of this
 our planet. Each of these has to become the witness of one of
 the periodical and ever-recurring cataclysms (by fire and water)
 that close the cycle of every Root-race. And it is this Vaivasvata
 -- the Hindu ideal embodiment, called respectively Xisuthrus,
 Deukalion, Noah and by other names -- who is the allegorical man
 who rescued our race, when nearly the whole population of one
 hemisphere perished by water, while the other hemisphere was awakening
 from its temporary obscuration."*

 * The words "creation," "dissolution," etc.,
 do not render correctly the right meaning of either Manvantara
 or Pralaya. The <em>Vishnu Purana </em>enumerates several: The
 dissolution of all things is of four kinds, Parasara is made to
 <em>say: -- Naimittika</em> (occasional), when Brahma slumbers
 (his night, when, "At the end of this day occurs a re-coalescence
 <em>of the Universe, </em>called Brahma's contingent re-coalescence,"
 because Brahma <em>is</em> this universe itself); "<em>Prakritika</em>
 (elemental), when the return of this universe to its original
 nature is partial and physical; <em>Atyantika</em> (absolute),
 identification of <em>the embodied </em>with the incorporeal Supreme
 spirit -- Mahatmic state, whether temporary or until the following
 <em>Maha Kalpa: </em>also absolute obscuration -- as of a whole
 [[Footnote continued on next page]] </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 310 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 Thus it is shown that there is no real discrepancy in speaking
 of the Vaivasvata Manvantara (<em>Manu-antara, </em>lit. "between
 two Manus") 18,000,000 odd years ago, when physical, or the
 truly human man first appeared in his Fourth Round on this earth;
 and of the other Vaivasvatas, <em>e.g., </em>the Manu of the Great
 Cosmic or sidereal Flood (a mystery), or again the Manu Vaivasvata
 of the submerged Atlantis, when the <em>racial</em> Vaivasvata
 saved the elect of Humanity, the Fifth Race, from utter destruction.
 As the several (and quite different) events are purposely blended
 in the <em>Vishnu </em>and other Puranas in one narrative, there
 may yet be a great deal of perplexity left in the profane reader's
 mind. Therefore, as constant elucidation is needed, we must be
 forgiven unavoidable repetitions. The blinds which conceal the
 real mysteries of Esoteric philosophy are great and puzzling,
 and even now the last word cannot be given. The veil, however,
 may be a little more removed and some explanations, hitherto denied,
 may now be offered to the earnest student.
 </p><p>
 As somebody -- Colonel Vans Kennedy, if we do not mistake -- remarked,
 "the first principle in Hindu religious philosophy is <em>Unity
 in</em> <em>diversity.</em>"<em> </em>If all those Manus
 and Rishis are called by one generic name, this is due to the
 fact that they are one and all the manifested Energies of one
 and the same <strong>L</strong>OGOS, the celestial, as well as
 the terrestrial messengers and permutations of that Principle
 which is ever in a state of activity; conscious during the period
 of Cosmic evolution, unconscious (from our point of view) during
 Cosmic rest, as the Logos sleepeth in the bosom of THAT which
 "sleepeth not," nor is it ever awake -- for it is SAT
 or <em>Be-ness, </em>not a Being. It is from IT that issues the
 great unseen Logos, who evolves all the other <em>logoi, </em>the
 primeval <strong>M</strong>ANU who gives being to the other Manus,
 who emanate the universe and all in it collectively, and who represent
 in their aggregate the <em>manifested </em>Logos.* Hence we learn
 in the "Commentaries" that while no Dhyan Chohan, not
 even the highest, can realise completely "the condition of
 the preceding Cosmic evolution," "the Manus retain a
 knowledge of their experiences of all the Cosmic evolutions throughout
 Eternity." This is very plain: the first Manu is called <em>Swayambhuva,</em>

 and <em>Nitya </em>(perpetual) <em>Mahapralaya </em>for the Universe,
 <em>death -- </em>for man, <em>nitya</em> is the extinction of
 life, like the extinction of a lamp," also "in sleep
 at night." <em>Nitya Sarga </em>is "constant or perpetual
 creation," as <em>Nitya pralaya </em>is "constant or
 perpetual destruction of all that is born." "That which
 ensues after a minor dissolution is called ephemeral creation.
 . . . This is Samyama" (production, existence, and dissolution)
 (<em>Vishnu Purana, Book I., ch. vii.</em>) The subject is so
 difficult that we are obliged to repeat our statements.

 * But see the superb definitions of Parabrahmam and the Logos
 in Mr. Subba Row's Lectures on the <em>Bhagavat Gita </em>in the
 early numbers of the Theosophist of 1887, Feb., March, April,
 and May.</p><hr>

 <p>
 "the Self-manifested," the Son of the <em>unmanifested
 </em><strong>F</strong>ATHER. The Manus are the creators of the
 creators of our First Race -- the Spirit of mankind -- which does
 not prevent the <em>seven </em>Manus from having been the first
 "pre-Adamic" men on Earth.
 </p><p>
 Manu declares himself created by Viraj,* or Vaiswanara, (the Spirit
 of Humanity),** which means that his Monad emanates from the never
 resting Principle in the beginning of every new Cosmic activity:
 that <em>Logos </em>or <strong>U</strong>NIVERSAL <strong>M</strong>ONAD
 (collective Elohim) that radiates <em>from</em> <em>within himself
 all </em>those Cosmic Monads that become the centres of activity
 -- progenitors of the numberless Solar systems as well as of the
 yet undifferentiated <em>human</em> monads of planetary chains
 as well as of every being thereon. Each Cosmic Monad is "Swayambhuva,"
 the SELF-BORN, <em>which becomes the Centre of Force, from within
 which</em> <em>emerges a planetary chain </em>(of which chains
 there are seven in our system), and whose radiations become again
 so many Manus Swayambhuva (a generic name, mysterious and meaning
 far more than appears), each of these becoming, as a <em>Host,
 </em>the Creator of his own Humanity. (<em>See </em>"<em>The
 Manus and the Manvantaras Explained by a Western Mystic</em> <em>and
 Mathematician.</em>")
 </p><p>
 As to the question of the four distinct races of mankind that
 preceded our Fifth Race, there is nothing mystical in it, except
 the ethereal bodies of the first races; and it is a matter of
 legendary, nevertheless, very correct history. That legend is
 universal. And if the Western <em>savant </em>pleases to see in
 it only a myth, it does not make the slightest difference. The
 Mexicans had, and still have, the tradition of the fourfold destruction
 of the world by fire and water, just as the Egyptians had, and
 the Hindus have, to this day.
 </p><p>
 Trying to account for the community of legends in the remote antiquity
 -- held by Chinese, Chaldean, Egyptians, Indians and Greeks --
 and for the absence of any certain vestige of civilization more
 ancient than 5,000 years, the author of "<em>Mythical Monsters,</em>"<em>
 </em>remarks, that "we must not be surprised if we do not
 immediately discover the vestiges of the people of ten, fifteen,
 or twenty thousand years ago. With an ephemeral architecture (as
 in China), the sites of vast cities may have become entirely lost
 to recollection in a few thousands of years from natural decay
 . . . and how much more . . . if . . . minor cataclysms have intervened,
 such as local inundations, earthquakes, deposition of volcanic
 ashes, the spread of sandy deserts, destruction of life by

 **<em> See Manu I., </em>32, 33. Vaiswanara is, in another sense,
 the living magnetic fire that pervades the manifested solar system.
 It is the most objective (to us the reverse) and ever present
 aspect of the ONE LIFE, for it is the Vital Principle. (<em>See
 Theosophist,</em> <em>July, </em>1883, <em>p</em>. 249). It is
 also a name of <em>Agni.</em> </p><hr>

 deadly pestilence, by miasma, or by the outpour of sulphurous
 fumes." ("<em>Mythical Monsters,</em>"<em> </em>by
 Ch. Gould, p. 134.)
 </p><p>
 And how many of such cataclysms have changed the whole surface
 of the earth may be inferred from this <em>Stanza:</em> 
 </p><p>
 "<em>During the first seven </em>crores <em>of the Kalpa
 </em>(70,000,000 years) <em>the</em> <em>Earth and its two Kingdoms
 </em>(mineral and vegetable), <em>one already having</em> <em>achieved
 its seventh circle, the other, hardly nascent, are luminous and</em>
 <em>semi-ethereal, cold, lifeless, and translucid. In the eleventh
 crore* the</em> <em>mother</em> (Earth) <em>grows opaque, and
 in the </em>FOURTEENTH** <em>the throes of</em> <em>adolescence
 take place. These convulsions of nature </em>(geological changes)
 <em>last till her twentieth crore of years, uninterruptedly, after
 which they</em> <em>become periodical, and at long intervals.</em>"
 </p><p>
 <em>The last change took place nearly twelve crores of years ago
 </em>(<em>120,000,000</em>)<em>. But the Earth with everything
 on her face had become cool,</em> <em>hard and settled ages earlier.
 </em>(<em>Commentary, xxii.</em>)
 </p><p>
 Thus, if we are to believe esoteric teaching, there have been
 no more <em>universal </em>geological disturbances and changes
 for the last 120 millions of years, and the Earth was, even before
 that time, ready to receive her human stock. The appearance of
 the latter, however, in its full physical development, as already
 stated, took place only about eighteen millions of years ago,
 after the first great failure of nature to create beings alone,
 without the help of the divine "Fashioners," had been
 followed by the successive evolution of the first three races
 (<em>See</em> <em>above Stanzas III. et seq</em>.).<em> </em>The
 actual duration of the first two and a-half Races is withheld
 from all but the higher Initiates. The History of the Races begins
 at the separation of the Sexes, when the preceding egg-bearing
 androgynous race perished rapidly, and the subsequent sub-races
 of the

 <p>
 * This -- in the period of <em>Secondary </em>creation, so called.
 Of the <em>Primary, </em>when Earth is in possession of the three<em>
 Elemental</em> Kingdoms, we cannot speak for several reasons,
 one of which is, that, unless one is a great seer, or naturally
 intuitional, he will be unable to realise that which can never
 be expressed in any existing terms.
 </p><p>
 ** Hippocrates said that number seven "By its occult virtues
 tended to the accomplishment of all things, to be the dispenser
 of life and fountain of all its changes." The life of man
 he divided into seven ages (Shakespeare), for "As the moon
 changes her phases every seven days, this number influences all
 sublunary beings," and even the Earth, as we know. With the
 child, it is the teeth that appear in the seventh month and he
 sheds them at seven years; at twice seven puberty begins, at three
 times seven all our mental and vital powers are developed, at
 four times seven he is in his full strength, at five times seven
 his passions are most developed, etc., etc. Thus for the Earth.
 It is now in its middle age, yet very little wiser for it. The
 <em>Tetragrammaton,</em> the four-lettered sacred name of the
 Deity, can be resolved on Earth only by becoming Septenary through
 the manifest triangle proceeding from the concealed <em>Tetraktis</em>.
 Therefore, the number seven has to be adopted on this plane. As
 written in the Kabala "The greater Holy Assembly" v.
 1161: -- "For assuredly there is no stability in those six,
 save (what they derive) from <em>the seventh. </em>For <em>all
 things depend from the </em>SEVENTH."</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 313 THE ESOTERIC MEANING OF "FISH."
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 Third Root-Race appeared as an entirely new race <em>physiologically.
 It</em> is this "destruction" which is called allegorically
 the great "Vaivasvata Manu Deluge," when the account
 shows Vaivasvata Manu (or "Humanity") remaining alone
 on Earth in the Ark of Salvation towed by Vishnu in the shape
 of a monstrous fish, and the Seven Rishis "with him."
 The allegory is very plain: --
 </p><p>
 In the Symbolism of every nation, the "Deluge" stands
 for Chaotic unsettled matter -- Chaos itself: and the Water for
 the feminine principle -- the "Great Deep." As the Greek
 Lexicon of Parkhurst gives it -- "<em>Arche</em> (ark) answers
 to the Hebrew <em>rasit, </em>or Wisdom . . . . and (at the same
 time) to the emblem of the female generative power, the <em>Arg</em>
 or <em>Arca, </em>in which the germ of nature (and of mankind)
 floats or broods on the great Abyss of the waters, during the
 interval which takes place after every mundane (or racial) cycle."
 Ark is also the mystic name of the divine spirit of <em>life</em>
 which broods over chaos. Now Vishnu <em>is </em>the divine Spirit,
 as an abstract principle, and also as the <em>Preserver</em> and
 <em>Generator, </em>or <em>Giver of life </em>-- the third person
 of the Trimurti (composed of Brahma, the Creator, Siva, the Destroyer,
 and Vishnu, the Preserver). Vishnu is shown in the allegory as
 guiding, under the form of a <em>fish, </em>the Ark of Vaivasvata
 Manu clean across the waters of the Flood. There is no use in
 expatiating upon the esoteric meaning of the word <em>fish.</em>
 (<em>See Payne Knight, Inman, Gerald Massey, etc.</em>) Its theological
 meanings is phallic, but the metaphysical, <em>divine</em>. Jesus
 is called the "Fish," and so were Vishnu and Bacchus:
 [[<em>Ies</em>]], the "Saviour" of mankind, being but
 the monogram of the god Bacchus called [[<em>Ichthus</em>]], the
 fish.* As to the Seven Rishis in the Ark, they symbolised the
 seven principles, which became complete in man only after he had
 separated, and become a <em>human, </em>and no longer a divine
 creature. (<em>See for further</em> <em>details, </em>"<em>The
 Seventh Manu.</em>")
 </p><p>
 Nor have we many details about the submersion of the continent
 inhabited by the Second Root Race. But the history of the Third,
 "Lemuria," is given, as is that of Atlantis, the others
 being only alluded to. Lemuria is said to have perished about
 700,000 years before the commencement of what is now called the
 Tertiary age (the Eocene),** and it is during this Deluge also
 -- an actual geological deluge this time -- that Vaivasvata Manu
 is again shown as saving mankind (allegorically it is mankind,
 or a portion of it, the Fourth Race, which is saved); so also
 he saves the Fifth Race during the destruction of the last Atlanteans,

 by one great fish,</em>"<em> </em>says Tertullian of the
 Christians and Christ and the Church.

 <p>
 remnants that perished 850,000 years ago,* after which there was
 no great submersion until the day of Plato's Atlantis, or Poseidonis,
 known to the Egyptians only because it happened in such relatively
 recent times.
 </p><p>
 It is the submersion of the great Atlantis which is the most interesting.
 It is of this cataclysm that the old records (<em>See the </em>"<em>Book
 of Enoch</em>") say that "the ends of the Earth got
 loose;" and upon which the legends and allegories of Vaivasvata,
 Xisuthrus, Noah, Deukalion and all the <em>tutti quanti </em>of
 the Elect saved, have been built. Tradition, taking into no account
 the difference between sidereal and geological phenomena, calls
 both indifferently "deluges." Yet there is a great difference.
 The cataclysm which destroyed the huge continent of which Australia
 is the largest relic, was due to a series of subterranean convulsions
 and the breaking asunder of the ocean floors. That which put an
 end to its successor -- the fourth continent -- was brought on
 by successive disturbances in the axial rotation. It began during
 the earliest tertiary periods, and, continuing for long ages,
 carried away successively the last vestige of Atlantis, with the
 exception, perhaps, of Ceylon and a small portion of what is now
 Africa. It changed the face of the globe, and no memory of its
 flourishing continents and isles, of its civilizations and sciences,
 remained in the annals of history, save in the Sacred records
 of the East.
 </p><p>
 Hence, Modern Science denies Atlantis and its existence. It even
 denies any violent shiftings of the Earth's axis, and would attribute
 the reason for the change of climates to other causes. But this
 question is still an open one. If Dr. Croll will have it that
 all such alterations can be accounted for by the effects of nutation
 and the precession of the equinoxes, there are other men of Science,
 such as Sir H. James (<em>Athenaeum, Aug. </em>25, 1860), and
 Sir John Lubbock (<em>ibid</em>), who feel more inclined to accept
 the idea that they are due to a change in the position of the
 axis of rotation. Against this the majority of the astronomers
 are again arrayed. But then, what have they not denied before
 now, and what have they not denounced -- only to accept it later
 on whenever the hypothesis became undeniable fact?
 </p><p>
 How far our figures agree, or rather disagree with modern Science
 will be seen further in the <em>Addenda </em>to this Book, where
 the geology and anthropology of our modern day are carefully compared
 with the same in Archaic Science. At any rate, the period assigned
 in the Secret Doctrine for the sinking of Atlantis, does not seem
 to disagree
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------

 <p>
 * This event, the destruction of the famous island of <em>Ruta
 </em>and the smaller one <em>Daitya, </em>which occurred 850,000
 years ago in the later Pliocene times, must not be confounded
 with the submersion of the main continent of Atlantis during the
 Miocene period. Geologists cannot place the Miocene only so short
 a way back as 850,000 years; whatever they do, it is several million
 years ago that the main Atlantis perished.</p><hr>

 very much with the calculations of Modern Science, which calls
 Atlantis "Lemuria," however, whenever it accepts such
 a submerged continent. With regard to the pre-human period, all
 that can be said, at present, is, that even up to the appearance
 of the "Mindless" First Race, the Earth was not without
 its inhabitants. More may be said: that which Science -- recognizing
 <em>only physical man -- </em>has a right to regard as the <em>prehuman
 </em>period, may be conceded to have extended from the First Race
 down to the first half of the Atlantean race, since it is only
 then that man became the "complete <em>organic </em>being
 he is now." And this would make <em>Adamic </em>man no older
 than a few million of years.*

 The author of the Qabbalah remarks truly that "Man to-day,
 as an individual, is only a concatenation of the being-hood of
 precedent human life," or <em>lives, </em>rather. "According
 to the Qabbalah, the soul sparks contained in Adam (Rishoun),
 went into three principal classes corresponding to his three <em>sons,
 </em>viz.: Hesed, Habel, Ge-boor-ah, Qai-yin and <em>Ra</em>'<em>hmin</em>
 Seth. These three were divided into 70 species, called: the principal
 roots of the human race." (p. 422.)

 "Said Rabbi Jehudah: 'How many garments (of the incorporeal
 man) are these which are crowned' (from the day man was 'created')?
 Said R. El'eazar: 'The mountains of the world (the great men of
 the generation) are in discussion upon it, but there are three:
 one to clothe in that garment the Rua'h spirit, which is in the
 garden (of Eden) on earth: one which is more precious than all,
 in which the <em>Neshamah is </em>clothed in that Bundle of Life,
 between the angels of the Kings . . . : and one outside garment,
 which exists and does not exist, is seen and not seen. In that
 garment, the <em>Nephesh </em>is clothed, and she goes and flies
 in it, to and fro in the world." (Zohar I., 119<em>b</em>.
 col. 475; Qabbalah, 412.)

 This relates to the races (their "garments," or degree
 of materiality) and to the three principles of man in their three
 vehicles.

 * Mr. Huxley divides those races into the quintuple group of Australioids,
 Negroids, Mongoloids, Xanthochroics and Melanochroics -- all issuing
 from imaginary Anthropoids. And yet, while protesting against
 those who say "that the structural differences between man
 and apes are small and insignificant," and adding that "every
 bone of the gorilla bears a mark by which it can be distinguished
 from a corresponding human bone," and that "in the present
 state of creation, at least, no intermediary being fills the gap
 which separates the man from the troglodyte" -- the great
 anatomist goes on speaking of the Simian characteristics in Man!

 <em>Species,</em>"<em> p. </em>113.)
