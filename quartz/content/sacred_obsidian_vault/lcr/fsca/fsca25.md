 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">This</span> chimerical creature was said to be produced from a cock's egg hatched by a serpent; hence its name. It differs from the wyvern of heraldry only in having a head like that of a dunghill cock. "This monster is of that nature," says an old writer, "that its look or breath is said to be deadly poison"; and this, in addition to the ordinary weapons of offence, would constitute it rather a difficult creature to be interfered with.</p>

 <p>The cockatrice is frequently referred to in the Scriptures as the type of something evil. "The weaned child shall put his<a name="img_10500"></a>

 <p>And Jeremiah viii. 17: "For behold, I will send serpents, cockatrices, among you which will not be charmed, and they shall bite you, saith the Lord."</p>  
 <p>The cockatrice is a frequent emblem in heraldry, borne as a charge upon the shield and also as a supporter. To the mailed draconic form of the wyvern it had the hideous crested head with livid dangling wattles similar to the dunghill cock, its round glittering eyes dealing death; its barbed tongue and serpentine tail, with deadly sting, would no doubt render it a fearful object to behold, and terrific to its enemies. It is always borne in profile, the wings endorsed, or back to back, unless directed otherwise. The tail is frequently nowed, <i>i.e.</i>, knotted.</p>

 <p><i>Sable, a cockatrice, displayed argent, crested, membered and jelloped gules</i>.—<i>Baggine</i>.</p>  
 <p><i>Jelloped</i>, <i>jowlopped</i>, terms used to describe the comb or crest, and gills or wattles, when of a different tincture from the body. <i>Beaked</i> and <i>membered</i>, in similar manner, have reference to the beak and legs.</p>
