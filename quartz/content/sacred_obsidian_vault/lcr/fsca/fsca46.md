 <p>Note.—In a heraldic description (or blazon as it is termed) it is necessary for the sake of greater clearness, and to prevent confusion, to name the older mythical creature the "<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Heraldic Tigre</span>," that it may not be confounded with its natural representative usually called the "<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Royal Tiger</span>"</p>
