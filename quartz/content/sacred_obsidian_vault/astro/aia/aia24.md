   <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XXI.</h3>  <h3 align="center">TO KNOW WHETHER A THING DEMANDED WILL BE BROUGHT TO PERFECTION, YEA OR NAY.</h3>  
 <p>THE ancients have delivered unto us, that there are four ways or means which discover whether a person's question demanded shall be accomplished, yea or nay.</p>  
 <p><i>Conjunction</i>.--First, by conjunction: when therefore you find the lord of the ascendant, and the lord of that house which signifies the thing demanded, hastening to a ☌, and in the first house, or in any <i>angle</i>, and the significators meet with no prohibition or refranation, before they come to perfect ☌, you may then judge that the thing sought after shall be brought to pass without any manner of let or impediment; the sooner, if the significators be swift in motion, and essentially or accidentally strong; but if this ☌ of the significators be in a <i>succeedent</i> house, it will be perfected, but not so soon; if in <i>cadent</i> houses, with infinite loss of time, some difficulty, and much struggling.</p>  
 <p><i>Aspects of</i> ✶ <i>or</i> △.--Things are also effected, when the principal signifiers apply by ✶ or △ aspect out of good houses and places where they are essentially well dignified, and meet with no malevolent aspect to intervene ere they come to be in perfect ✶ or △.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_78"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 78</font></a></p>  
 <p><i>Aspects of</i> ☐ <i>and</i> ☍.--Things are also produced to perfection when the significators apply by ☐ aspect, provided each planet have dignity in the degrees wherein they are, and apply out of proper and good houses; otherwise not. Sometimes it happens that a matter is effected when the significators apply by ☍, but it is when there is mutual <i>reception</i> by <i>house</i>, and out of friendly houses, and the ☽ separating from the significator of the thing demanded, and applying presently to the lord of the ascendant. I have seldom seen any thing drought to perfection by this way of opposition, but the querent had been better the thing had been undone; for, if the question was concerning marriage, the parties seldom agreed, but were ever wrangling and disputing, each party repining at his evil choice, laying the blame upon their covetous parents, as having no mind to it themselves; and if the question was about portion or monies, the querent did, it is true, recover his money or portion promised, but it cost him more to procure it in suit of law than the debt was worth; and so have I seen it happen in many other things, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p><i>Translation</i>.--Things are brought to perfection by <i>translation</i> of light and nature, in this manner:--When the significators both of querent and quesited are separating from ☌, or ✶, or △ aspects of each other, and some other planet separates himself from one of the significators, of whom he is received, either by house, triplicity, or term, <a name="fr_56"></a><a href="#fn_56"><font size="1">1</font></a> and then this planet applies to the other significator by ☌ or aspect, before he meets with the ☌ or aspect of any other planets; he thus translates the force, influence, and virtue of the first significator to the other, and then this intervening planet, (or such a man or woman as is signified by that planet,) shall bring the matter in hand to perfection.</p>  
 <p>Consider what house the planet interposing or translating</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_79"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 79</font></a></p>  
 <p>the nature and light of the two planets is lord of, and describe him or her; and say to the querent, that such a party shall do good in the business of, &amp;c.; viz. if lord of the second, a good purse effects the matter; if lord of the third, a kinsman or neighbour; and so of all the rest of the houses; of which more hereafter.</p>  
 <p><i>Collection</i>.--Matters are also brought to perfection, when the two principal significators do not behold one another, but both cast their several aspects to a more weighty planet than themselves, and they both receive him in some of their essential dignities; then shall that planet, who thus <i>collects</i> both their lights, bring the thing demanded to perfection; which signifies that a person somewhat interested in both parties, and described and signified by that planet, shall perform the thing which otherwise could not be perfected; as many times you see two fall at variance, and of themselves cannot think of any way of accommodation, when suddenly a neighbour or friend accidentally reconciles all differences, to the content of both parties; and this is called a collection.</p>  
 <p>In all questions, you are generally to observe this method following:--The ascendant represents the person of the querent, and the second his estate, the third his kindred, the fourth his father, the fifth his children, the sixth his servant or sickness, the seventh his wife, the eighth the manner of his death, the ninth his religion or journeys, the tenth his estimation or honour, mother, trade, &amp;c.; the eleventh his friends, the twelfth his secret enemies: also understand, that when one asks concerning a woman, or any party signified by the seventh house and the lord thereof, that then the seventh house shall be her ascendant, and signify her person; the eighth house shall signify her estate, and be her second; the ninth house shall signify her brethren and kindred; the tenth shall represent her father; the eleventh her children, or whether</p>  
 <p><a name="page_80"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 80</font></a></p>  
 <p>apt to have children; the twelfth her sickness and servants; the first house her sweetheart; the second house her death; the third her journey; the fourth her mother, or trade, &amp;c.; the fifth her friends; the sixth her sorrow, care, and private enemies. Let the question be of or concerning a churchman, minister, or the brother of the wife or sweetheart, the ninth house shall represent each of these; but the tenth house shall be significator of <i>his</i> substance; the eleventh house of his brethren; and so in order: and so in all manner of questions, the house signifying the party quesited shall be his ascendant or first house, the next his second house, and so continuing round about the whole heavens of twelve houses. If a question be made of a king or nobleman, the tenth is his first house, the eleventh his second, &amp;c.; but in nativities, the ascendant always influences the party born, whether king or beggar. These things preceding being well understood, you may proceed to judgment; not that it is necessary you have all that is written in your memory exactly, but, that you be able to know when you are in error, when not; when to judge a question, when not.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Of the true Time of erecting a Figure</i>.</p>  
 <p>The proper time is that when you feel most anxious about any matter, and first form the resolution to erect a figure on the subject: if you find the figure radical, and lay aside all self-love and prejudice, you may safely judge a figure erected for that instant of time.</p>  
 <p>If a person apply to an astrologer, the figure must be taken for the exact time he first speaks on the subject; or, if it be by letter, when it is first read and understood by the artist. If it be not a question, but an event suddenly happening, then the moment of its commencement will shew, by a figure, its result &amp;c.; as the first setting off on a journey, beginning</p>  
 <p><a name="page_81"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 81</font></a></p>  
 <p>a letter, or any business, &amp;c.; or when you first discover the loss of any article, or hear of any event happening: in all these cases, the first impression on your mind is the true moment for the figure.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Of the Planet or Planets which hinder or impedite the Thing demanded in any Question</i>.</p>  
 <p>In all questions consider carefully what planet it is which obstructs or hinders the perfection of the thing desired. We receive judgment herein from that planet with whom the lord of the ascendant be joined, (whether by bodily ☌ or by aspect), or the significator of the thing inquired after, whether it be the ☽ herself, or that she be partaker with the lord of the ascendant or not, or signify the thing demanded.</p>  
 <p>Carefully observe the planet to which the querent's significator is joined, or the ☽; and observe how that planet is disposed, and unto whom <i>he</i> is joined; for if the lord of the ascendant, ☽, or significator of the thing propounded, be joined to an evil planet, evilly disposed, without reception, or if he be not evilly disposed, but be joined to an infortune, and that infortune receive him not, it denotes the destruction of the thing demanded.</p>  
 <p>A planet is ill-disposed when he is <i>peregrine</i>, <i>retrograde</i>, <i>combust</i>; also if <i>cadent</i> and behold not the lord of the house or the cusp of the house of the thing demanded. The aspect to the cusp is better than to the lord of the house.</p>  
 <p>If the significator, as above, be joined to an unfortunate planet, viz. one retrograde, combust, or cadent; then observe whether mutual reception intervene; which shews the perfection of the matter, though with much labour and solicitation. If there be no reception, the affair will come to nothing though there may have been much probability of its performance.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_82"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 82</font></a></p>  
 <p>If the lord of the ascendant, the ☽, or lord of the thing demanded, or the planet who receives any of them, be free from affliction, though without mutual reception, it perfects the matter with facility.</p>  
 <p>If any one of them be free from the infortunes, and joined with any benevolent planet, who is himself aspected by a malevolent, without mutual reception, the matter will be brought to a good conclusion.</p>  
 <p>Consider carefully whether planets in aspect be without reception, for when they are in reception, things are ever brought to pass; though, if the aspect be evil, with degree of trouble, delay, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p>Consider also, whether any other planet <i>prohibit</i> before the significators join in perfect ☌ with an evil planet; if so, it hinders the thing from happening: but if no such prohibition or cutting off the light of the <i>infortune</i> occur, by which its malevolence may be taken off, the thing will be effected.</p>  
 <p>If an infortune <i>collect</i> the light of other planets, or if light be translated to an infortune, the matter will not be effected unless there be reception; viz. that the infortune be received by, or disposed of, or ruled by, (which is all one thing), the significators.</p>
