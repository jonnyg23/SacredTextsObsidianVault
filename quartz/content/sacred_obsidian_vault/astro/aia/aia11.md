   <h3 align="center">CHAPTER VIII.</h3>  <h3 align="center">OF THE SUN, HIS GENERAL AND PARTICULAR SIGNIFICATIONS.</h3>  
 <p>THE Sun is placed in the middle of all the planets, continually visible to all mortal men. He passes through all the twelve signs of the zodiac in one year: his mean motion is 59 minutes 8 seconds, yet his diurnal motion is sometimes 57 minutes 16 seconds, sometimes more, but never exceeding 61 minutes and 6 seconds. He always moves in the ecliptic, and is ever void of latitude. He has only the sign ♌ for his house, and ♒ for his detriment. He is exalted in the 19th degree of ♈, and receives his fall in 19° ♎.</p>  
 <p>The Sun governs the fiery triplicity, viz. ♈, ♌, ♐, by day. He is always direct, and never can be considered retrograde.</p>

 <p><i>Manners when well dignified</i>.--Very faithful, keeping their promises with the greatest punctuality; a kind of itching desire to rule and sway wherever he comes. Prudent, and of incomparable judgment; of great majesty and stateliness, industrious to acquire honour and a large patrimony, yet as willing to spend it again. The solar man usually speaks with gravity, but not many words, and these with great confidence and command of his own feelings; full of thought, secret, trusty, speaks deliberately, and, notwithstanding his great heart, he is affable, tractable, and very humane to all people; one loving sumptuousness and magnificence, and whatever is honourable; no sordid thoughts can enter his heart.</p>  
 <p><i>When ill dignified</i>.--Then the solar man is arrogant and proud, disdaining all men, boasting of his pedigree; he is purblind in sight and judgment, restless, troublesome, domineering, a mere vapour, expensive, foolish, endowed with no gravity in words, or soberness. in actions; a spendthrift, wasting his patrimony, and hanging on other men's charity; yet he thinks all men are bound to him, because a gentleman born.</p>

 <p><i>Sicknesses</i>.--Pimples in the face, palpitation or trembling, diseases of the brain and heart, infirmities of the eyes, cramps, sudden swoonings, diseases of the mouth and impure breath, catarrhs, putrid fevers.

 <p><a name="fn_28"></a><a href="aia11.htm#fr_28">44:1</a> In nativities the ☉ and ☽ are oriental between the 1st and 10th houses, and in the opposite quarter of the figure; they are occidental between the 10th and 7th houses, and in the opposite quarter: but in horary questions they are oriental between the 4th and 10th, and occidental after leaving the 10th, until they reach the 4th; oriental when rising, and occidental when setting.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_29"></a><a href="aia11.htm#fr_29">44:2</a> It is a very remarkable fact, that this period is the <i>sothic</i> or <i>canicular</i> year of the Egyptians; whence it is pretty evident that these astrological doctrines came originally from that people, and are, in fact, of the very highest antiquity.</p>
