 <p>JUPITER is placed next to Saturn. He is the greatest in appearance to our eyes, of all the planets (the ☉, ☽, and ♀ excepted): in his colour he is bright, clear, and of an azure hue. In his motion he exceeds Saturn, finishing his course through the twelve signs, in 14 years, 314 days, and 12 hours; his middle motion is 4 minutes 52 seconds. His greatest north latitude is 1° 38'. His greatest south latitude is 1° 40'. He is retrograde about 120 days, is five days in his first station before retrogradation, and four days stationary before direction.</p>  
 <p><i>Nature</i>.--He is a masculine planet, temperately hot and moist, and the <i>greater fortune</i>; author of temperance, modesty, sobriety, justice.</p>  
 <p><i>Manners and Actions when well placed</i>.--Then he is magnanimous, faithful, bashful, aspiring in an honourable way at high matters; in all his actions a lover of fair dealing, desiring to benefit all men; doing glorious actions; honourable and religious, of sweet and affable conversation, wonderfully indulgent to his wife and children, reverencing aged men, a great reliever of the poor, full of charity and godliness; liberal, hating all sordid actions; just, wise, prudent, grateful and virtuous; so that when you find ♃ the significator of any man in question, and well dignified, you may judge him well qualified as aforesaid.</p>  
 <p><i>When ill dignified</i>.--When ♃ is unfortunate, then he wastes his patrimony, suffers every one to cozen him, is hypocritically religious, tenacious, and obstinate in maintaining false tenets in religion; he is ignorant, careless, nothing caring for the love of his friends; of a gross. dull capacity;</p>
