 <p align="center">DIAGRAM No. 1.<br> THE SEVEN VITAL, OR CREATIVE PRINCIPLES.</p>  
 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">This</span> Diagram is a formula expressing the creative energies of the Word, or Logos, the Greek of which is given in the centre of the star. The double triangle expresses the dual relation of the creative forces,as male and female,the ancient term of expression being <i>theos-sophy</i>. Their triune expression is, first, Spirit; second, Body; third, Soul. The seven points of the star are expressive of the seven primate creative principles, as named on the respective points; and when man conquers or subjugates these principles to the higher will within himself, he then attains the ultimates which stand expressed against the seven points. These seven creative principles are found to have their solar expression in the seven planets made use of in this system, and the different planetary signs are placed against their appropriate point, or principle, in juxtaposition to the sign of the zodiac in which they find their most natural or perfect expression. These seven points are called the seven vital principles. The body of man, being an epitome of the solar man, or nature, cannot exist without having these seven principles in working order, while he can live without the five serving principles provided he be served by others. The serpent encompassing the triangles is expressive of the circle of eternity, also of the psychic or sex principles of nature, which is active in the work of creation or generation.</p>

The full functions of man's physical nature find expression in the earth's zodiac on a reduced scale from that of the sun's zodiac, though in reversed positions, and having relation to polarity instead of quality.</p>

 <p align="center">DIAGRAM No. 7.<br> THE FUTURE TEMPLE AS SEEN BY JOHN.</p>  
 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The</span> picture of the Temple and arrangement of the controlling influence of the heavens in the earth, as seen by John (see Revelations xxi.). The above gives the twelve gates of the Temple in their respective trinities, with the name of the corresponding tribe and sign to which they belong; also the twelve foundations, with the names of the twelve apostles of Jesus. The letters N., S., E., W., are North, South, East, West. The circle is squared by the perfect law of God in its triune relation: first, or outer circle, the physical body; second, the soul; third, and innermost, the spiritual. This being squared by the perfect law, is a perfecting of the effort made by Solomon to carry out the injunction given to Moses: "See that thou make all things after the pattern shown thee in the mount. . . . The pattern of the heavens."</p>
