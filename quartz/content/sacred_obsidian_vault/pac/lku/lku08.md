   <h3 align="center">THE SEVENTH ERA.</h3>  
 <p>Over the mountains silence reigns--<br> The silence of night that has moved away,<br> And the silence of night that cometh,<br> The silence of night filled with people,<br> And the silence of night of dispersing.<br> ’Tis fearful the steps and narrow trails--<br> ’Tis fearful the amount eaten and left--<br> ’Tis fearful the night past and gone, <a name="page_22"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 22</font></a><br> The awful stillness of the night that came--<br> The night that went by and brought forth an offspring,<br> That offspring a dog,<br> A yellow dog, a tiny dog,<br> A dog without hair, sent by the gods,<br> A dog sent for sacrifice.<br> A speckled bird was first sacrificed,<br> Else he'd repent for having no hair,<br> Else he'd repent for having no covering,<br> And go naked on the road to Malama,<br> The easiest path for children,<br> From great to small,<br> From tall to short,<br> He is equal to the blowing breeze,<br> The younger brother of the god<br> From which sprang the gods of the bats--<br> The hairy bats. Sprang the bat with many claws--<br> Sprang the bat and moved away,<br> That the rising surf might give it birth.<br>                            ’Tis night.</p>
