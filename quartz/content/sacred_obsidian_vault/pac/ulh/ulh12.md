 <p>The costume of the hula dancer was much the same for both sexes, its chief article a simple short skirt about the waist, the pa-ú. (<a href="ulh00.htm#img_pl01">Pl. I.</a>)</p>  
 <p>When the time has come for a dance, the halau becomes one common dressing room. At a signal from the kumu the work begins. The putting on of each article of costume is accompanied by a special song.</p>  
 <p>First come the <i>ku-pe’e</i>, anklets of whale teeth, bone, shell-work, dog-teeth, fiber-stuffs, and what not. While all stoop in unison they chant the song of the anklet:</p>

 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Fragrant the grasses of high Kane-hoa.<br> Bind on the anklets, bind!<br> Bind with finger deft as the wind<br> That cools the air of this bower.<br> 5 Lehua bloom pales at my flower,<br> O sweetheart of mine,<br> Bud that I'd pluck and wear in my wreath,<br> If thou wert but a flower!</div>  
 <p>The short skirt, <i>pa-ú</i>, was the most important piece of attire worn by the Hawaiian female. As an article of daily wear it represented many stages of evolution beyond the primitive fig-leaf, being fabricated from a great variety of materials furnished by the garden of</p>

 <p>nature. In its simplest terms the pa-ú was a mere fringe of vegetable fibers. When placed as the shield of modesty about the loins of a woman of rank, or when used as the full-dress costume of a dancing girl on a ceremonious occasion, it took on more elaborate forms, and was frequently of <i>tapa</i>, a fabric the finest specimens of which would not have shamed the wardrobe of an empress.</p>  
 <p>In the costuming of the hula girl the same variety obtained as in the dress of a woman of rank. Sometimes her pa-ú would be only a close-set fringe of ribbons stripped from the bark of the hibiscus (<i>hau</i>), the <i>ti</i> leaf or banana fiber, or a fine rush, strung upon a thong to encircle the waist. In its most elaborate and formal style the pa-ú consisted of a strip of fine tapa, several yards long and of width to reach nearly to the knees. It was often delicately tinted or printed. as to its outer part, with stamped figures. The part of the tapa skirt thus printed, like the outer, decorative one in a set of tapa bed-sheets, was termed the <i>kilohana</i>.</p>  
 <p>The pa-ú worn by the danseuse, when of tapa, was often of such volume as to balloon like the skirt of a coryphée. To put it on was quite an art, and on that account, if not on the score of modesty, a portion of the halau was screened off and devoted to the use of the females as a dressing room, being known as the <i>unu-lau-koa</i>, and to this place they repaired as soon as the kumu gave the signal for dressing.</p>  
 <p>The hula pa-ú of the women was worn in addition to that of daily life; the hula pa-ú of the men, a less pretentious affair, was worn outside the malo, and in addition to it.</p>  
 <p>The method of girding on the pa-ú was peculiar. Beginning at the right hip--some say the left--a free end was allowed to hang quite to the knee; then, passing across the back, rounding the left hip, and returning by way of the abdomen to the starting point, another circuit of the waist was accomplished; and, a reverse being made, the garment was secured by passing the bight of the tapa beneath the hanging folds of the pa-ú from below upward until it slightly protruded above the border of the garment at the waist. This second end was thus brought to hang down the hip alongside of the first free end; an arrangement that produced a most decorative effect.</p>  
 <p>The Hawaiians, in their fondness for giving personal names to inanimate objects, named the two free ends (<i>apua</i>) of the pa-ú respectively <i>ku-kápu-úla-ka-láni</i> and <i>Léle-a-mahu’i</i>.</p>  
 <p>According to another method, which was simpler and more commonly employed, the piece was folded sidewise and, being gathered into pleats, a cord was inserted the length of the fold. The cord was passed about the waist, knotted at the hip, and thus held the garment secure.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_51"><font size="1" color="green">p. 51</font></a></p>  
 <p>While the girls are making their simple toilet and donning their unique, but scanty, costume, the kumu, aided by others, soothes the impatience of the audience and stimulates their imagination by cantillating a mele that sets forth in grandiloquent imagery the praise of the pa-ú.</p>

 <p>After the ceremony of the pa-ú came that of the lei, a wreath to crown the head and another for the neck and shoulders. It was not the custom in the old times to overwhelm the body with floral decorations and to blur the outlines of the figure to the point of disfigurement; nor was every flower that blows acceptable as an offering. The gods were jealous and nice in their tastes, pleased only with flowers indigenous to the soil--the ilima (<a href="#img_pl06">pl. VI</a>), the lehua, the maile, the ie-ie, and the like (see pp. <a href="ulh06.htm#page_19">19</a>, <a href="ulh06.htm#page_20">20</a>). The ceremony was quickly accomplished. As the company knotted the garlands about head or neck, they sang:</p>

These young birds are esteemed a delicacy. The kahuna, who was a bird-hunter, truthfully told the king that it was not the season for the young birds; the parent birds were haunting the ocean. At this some of the king's boon companions, moved by ill-will, charged the king's mountain retainer with suppressing the truth, and in proof they brought some tough old birds caught at sea and had them served for the kings table.

It was also applied to that part of a pa-ú which was decorated with figures.

 <p><a name="fn_113"></a><a href="ulh12.htm#fr_114">53:b</a> <i>O awili a Malu-ó</i>. The most direct and evident sense of the word <i>awili</i> is to wrap. It probably means the wrapping of the pa-ú about the loins; or it may mean the movable, shifty action of the pa-ú caused by the lively actions of the dancer. The expression <i>Malu-ó</i> may be taken from the utterance of the king's <i>ilamuku</i> (constable or sheriff) or other official, who, in proclaiming a tabu, held an idol in his arms and at the same time called out <i>Kapu, o-o</i>! The meaning is that the pa-ú, when wrapped about the woman's loins, laid a tabu on the woman. The old Hawaiian consulted on the meaning of this passage quoted the following, which illustrates the fondness of his people for endless repetitions and play upon words:</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Awiliwili i ka hale <a name="fr_119"></a><a href="#fn_118"><font size="1">1</font></a> o ka lauwili, e.<br> He lauwili ka makani, he Kaua-ula, <a name="fr_120"></a><a href="#fn_119"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> I hoapaapa i ka hale o ka lauwili, e:</div>
