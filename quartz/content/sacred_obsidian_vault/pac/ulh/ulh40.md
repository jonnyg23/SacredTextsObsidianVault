 <p>The hula <i>hoo-na-ná</i>--to quiet, amuse--was an informal dance, such as was performed without the usual restrictions of tabu that hedged about the set dances of the halau. The occasion of an outdoor festival, an <i>ahaaina</i> or <i>luau</i>, was made the opportunity for the exhibition of this dance. It seems to have been an expression of pure sportiveness and mirth-making, and was therefore performed without sacrifice or religious ceremony. While the king, chiefs, and <i>aialo</i>--courtiers who ate in the king's presence--are sitting with the guests about the festal board, two or three dancers of graceful carriage make a circuit of the place, ambling, capering, gesturing as they go in time to the words of a gay song.</p>  
 <p>A performance of this sort was witnessed by the author's informant in Honolulu many years ago; the occasion was the giving of a royal luau. There was no musical instrument, the performers were men, and the mele they cantillated went as follows:</p>

 <p><a name="fn_484"></a><a href="ulh40.htm#fr_500">244:b</a> <i>Muli-wa’a</i> (<i>muli</i>, a term applied to a younger brother). The idea involved is that of separation by an interval, as a younger brother is separated from his older brother by an interval. <i>Muliwai</i> is an interval of water, a stream. <i>Wa’a</i>, the last part of the above compound word, literally a canoe, is here used tropically to mean the tables, or the dishes, on which the food was spread, they being long and narrow, in the shape of a canoe. The whole term, consequently, refers to the people and the table about which they are seated.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_485"></a><a href="ulh40.htm#fr_501">244:c</a> <i>Eli-eli</i>. A word that is found in ancient prayers to emphasize the word <i>kapu</i> or the word <i>noa</i>.</p>
