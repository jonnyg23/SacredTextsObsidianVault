  <h3 align="center">Webster's Bible: Joshua</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD, it came to pass, that the LORD spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses's minister, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, to the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given to you, as I said to Moses. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> From the wilderness and this Lebanon even to the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and to the great sea towards the setting of the sun, shall be your border. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> Be strong and of a good courage: for to this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swore to their fathers to give them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate in it day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you provisions; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God giveth you to possess it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, spoke Joshua, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, The LORD your God hath given you rest, and hath given you this land. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side of Jordan; but ye shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valor, and help them; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> Until the LORD shall have given your brethren rest, as he hath given you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your God giveth them: then ye shall return to the land of your possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD'S servant gave you on this side of Jordan towards the sun-rising. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us, we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> According as we hearkened to Moses in all things, so will we hearken to thee: only the LORD thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> Every one that doth rebel against thy commandment, and will not hearken to thy words in all that thou commandest him, shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good courage. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> And Joshua the son of Nun sent from Shittim two men to spy secretly, saying, Go, view the land, even Jericho. And they went, and came into the house of a harlot, named Rahab, and lodged there. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither to-night of the children of Israel, to search out the country. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> And the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that have come to thee, who have entered into thy house: for they have come to search out all the country. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There came men to me, but I knew not whence they were: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> And it came to pass about the time of shutting the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out: whither the men went, I know not: pursue after them quickly; for ye will overtake them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> And the men pursued them the way to Jordan to the fords: and as soon as they who pursued them had gone out, they shut the gate. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> And before they had lain down, she came up to them upon the roof; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> And she said to the men, I know that the LORD hath given you the land, and that your terror hath fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were on the other side of Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> And as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you: for the LORD your God, he is God in heaven above, and in earth beneath. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> Now therefore, I pray you, swear to me by the LORD, since I have showed you kindness, that ye will also show kindness to my father's house, and give me a true token: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> And that ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not this our business. And it shall be, when the LORD hath given us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house was upon the town-wall, and she dwelt upon the wall. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> And she said to them, Depart to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers have returned: and afterward ye may go your way. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> And the men said to her, We will be blameless of this thy oath which thou hast made us swear. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:18">2:18</a> Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window by which thou didst let us down: and thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father's household home to thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:19">2:19</a> And it shall be, that whoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we will be guiltless: and whoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:20">2:20</a> And if thou shalt utter this our business, then we will be quit of thy oath which thou hast made us to swear. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:21">2:21</a> And she said, According to your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:22">2:22</a> And they went, and came to the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers had returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found them not. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:23">2:23</a> So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all things that befell them: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:24">2:24</a> And they said to Joshua, Truly the LORD hath delivered into our hands all the land; for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the host; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> And they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near to it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go: for ye have not passed this way heretofore. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> And Joshua said to the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to-morrow the LORD will do wonders among you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> And Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> And the LORD said to Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye have come to the brink of the water of Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> And Joshua said to the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear the words of the LORD your God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> And Joshua said, By this ye shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth over before you into Jordan. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out of every tribe a man. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand in a heap. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents to pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> And as they that bore the ark had come to Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bore the ark were dipped in the brim of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all its banks all the time of harvest,) </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> That the waters which came down from above stood and rose up in a heap very far from the city Adam, that is beside Zaretan; and those that came down towards the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, failed, and were cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> And the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people had passed quite over Jordan. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> And it came to pass, when all the people had quite passed over Jordan, that the LORD spoke to Joshua, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> Take you twelve men from the people, from every tribe a man, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> And command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan, from the place where the priests' feet stood firm, twelve stones, and ye shall carry them over with you, and leave them in the lodging-place where ye shall lodge this night. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, of every tribe a man: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> And Joshua said to them, Pass over before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of Jordan, and take ye up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> That this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these stones? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it passed over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be for a memorial to the children of Israel for ever. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones from the midst of Jordan, as the the LORD commanded Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, and carried them over with them to the place where they lodged, and laid them down there. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:9">4:9</a> And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there to this day. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:10">4:10</a> For the priests who bore the ark stood in the midst of Jordan, until every thing was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to speak to the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua: and the people hasted and passed over. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:11">4:11</a> And it came to pass, when all the people had quite passed over, that the ark of the LORD passed over, and the priests in the presence of the people. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:12">4:12</a> And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses directed them: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:13">4:13</a> About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the LORD to battle, to the plains of Jericho. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:14">4:14</a> On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel, and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:15">4:15</a> And the LORD spoke to Joshua, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:16">4:16</a> Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of Jordan. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:17">4:17</a> Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of Jordan. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:18">4:18</a> And it came to pass, when the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD had come up out of the midst of Jordan, and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up upon the dry land, that the waters of Jordan returned to their place, and flowed over all its banks, as they did before. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:19">4:19</a> And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:20">4:20</a> And those twelve stones which they took out of Jordan, did Joshua set up in Gilgal. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:21">4:21</a> And he spoke to the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these stones? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:22">4:22</a> Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:23">4:23</a> For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you, until ye had passed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we had gone over: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:24">4:24</a> That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the LORD that it is mighty: that ye might fear the LORD your God for ever. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:1">5:1</a> And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites who were on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites who were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we had passed over, that their heart melted; neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:2">5:2</a> At that time the LORD said to Joshua, Make thee sharp knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:3">5:3</a> And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:4">5:4</a> And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the people that came out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:5">5:5</a> Now all the people that came out were circumcised; but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth from Egypt, them they had not circumcised. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:6">5:6</a> For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the people that were men of war who came out of Egypt were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: to whom the LORD swore that he would not show them the land which the LORD swore to their fathers that he would give us, a land that floweth with milk and honey. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:7">5:7</a> And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:8">5:8</a> And it came to pass when they had done circumcising all the people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:9">5:9</a> And the LORD said to Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you: Wherefore the name of the place is called Gilgal to this day. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:10">5:10</a> And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:11">5:11</a> And they ate of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the same day. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:12">5:12</a> And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:13">5:13</a> And it came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went to him, and said to him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:14">5:14</a> And he said, No; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and worshiped, and said to him, What saith my lord to his servant? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:15">5:15</a> And the captain of the LORD'S host said to Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot, for the place on which thou standest is holy: and Joshua did so. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:1">6:1</a> Now Jericho was closely shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:2">6:2</a> And the LORD said to Joshua, See, I have given into thy hand Jericho, and its king, and the mighty men of valor. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:3">6:3</a> And ye shall compass the city, all ye men of war, and go round the city once: thus shalt thou do six days. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:4">6:4</a> And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams' horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:5">6:5</a> And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout: and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend every man straight before him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:6">6:6</a> And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said to them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:7">6:7</a> And he said to the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:8">6:8</a> And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken to the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns passed on before the LORD, and blew with the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:9">6:9</a> And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the rear-guard came after the ark, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:10">6:10</a> And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any word proceed from your mouth, until the day I bid you shout, then shall ye shout. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:11">6:11</a> So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about it once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:12">6:12</a> And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:13">6:13</a> And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the rear-guard came after the ark of the LORD, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:14">6:14</a> And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp. So they did six days. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:15">6:15</a> And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven times. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:16">6:16</a> And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, Shout; for the LORD hath given you the city. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:17">6:17</a> And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are in it, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:18">6:18</a> And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest ye make yourselves accursed, when ye take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:19">6:19</a> But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are consecrated to the LORD: they shall come into the treasury of the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:20">6:20</a> So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:21">6:21</a> And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:22">6:22</a> But Joshua had said to the two men that spied out the country, Go into the harlot's house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye swore to her. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:23">6:23</a> And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them without the camp of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:24">6:24</a> And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was in it: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:25">6:25</a> And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel even to this day; because she hid the messengers which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:26">6:26</a> And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: he shall lay its foundation in his first-born, and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:27">6:27</a> So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was noised throughout all the country. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:1">7:1</a> But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:2">7:2</a> And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth-aven, on the east side of Beth-el, and spoke to them, saying, Go up and view the country. And the men went up and viewed Ai. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:3">7:3</a> And they returned to Joshua, and said to him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; and make not all the people to labor thither; for they are but few. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:4">7:4</a> So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:5">7:5</a> And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for they chased them from before the gate even to Shebarim, and smote them in the going down: wherefore the hearts of the people melted, and became as water. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:6">7:6</a> And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the LORD until the evening, he and the elders of Israel, and put dust upon their heads. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:7">7:7</a> And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord GOD, why hast thou at all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? O that we had been content, and dwelt on the other side of Jordan. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:8">7:8</a> O Lord, what shall I say, when Israel turn their backs before their enemies! </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:9">7:9</a> For the Canaanites, and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and will environ us, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do to thy great name? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:10">7:10</a> And the LORD said to Joshua, Arise; Why liest thou thus upon thy face? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:11">7:11</a> Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have put it even among their own goods. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:12">7:12</a> Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because they were accursed: neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed from among you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:13">7:13</a> Rise, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to-morrow: for thus saith the LORD God of Israel, There is an accursed thing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thy enemies, until ye take away the accursed thing from among you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:14">7:14</a> In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the LORD taketh shall come according to their families: and the family which the LORD shall take shall come by households; and the household which the LORD shall take shall come man by man. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:15">7:15</a> And it shall be, that he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath: because he hath transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he hath wrought folly in Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:16">7:16</a> So Joshua rose early in the morning, and brought Israel by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:17">7:17</a> And he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:18">7:18</a> And he brought his household man by man; and Achan the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:19">7:19</a> And Joshua said to Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession to him; and tell me now what thou hast done, hide it not from me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:20">7:20</a> And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:21">7:21</a> When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them, and behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:22">7:22</a> So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent, and behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:23">7:23</a> And they took them from the midst of the tent, and brought them to Joshua, and to all the children of Israel, and laid them out before the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:24">7:24</a> And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them to the valley of Achor. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:25">7:25</a> And Joshua said, why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:26">7:26</a> And they raised over him a great heap of stones to this day. So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger: wherefore the name of that place was called the valley of Achor to this day. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:1">8:1</a> And the LORD said to Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:2">8:2</a> And thou shalt do to Ai and her king, as thou didst to Jericho and her king: only its spoil, and its cattle, shall ye take for a prey to yourselves: lay thee an ambush for the city behind it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:3">8:3</a> So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valor, and sent them away by night. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:4">8:4</a> And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait against the city, even behind the city: go not very far from the city, but be ye all ready: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:5">8:5</a> And I, and all the people that are with me, will approach to the city: and it shall come to pass when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:6">8:6</a> (For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: therefore we will flee before them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:7">8:7</a> Then ye shall rise from the ambush and seize upon the city: for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:8">8:8</a> And it shall be when ye have taken the city, that ye shall set the city on fire: according to the commandment of the LORD shall ye do. See, I have commanded you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:9">8:9</a> Joshua therefore sent them forth; and they went to lie in ambush, and abode between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:10">8:10</a> And Joshua rose early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:11">8:11</a> And all the people, even the people of war that were with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between them and Ai. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:12">8:12</a> And he took about five thousand men; and set them to lie in ambush between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of the city. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:13">8:13</a> And when they had set the people, even all the host that was on the north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:14">8:14</a> And it came to pass when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted and rose early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain: but he knew not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the city. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:15">8:15</a> And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:16">8:16</a> And all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursue them: and they pursued Joshua, and were drawn away from the city. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:17">8:17</a> And there was not a man left in Ai, or Beth-el that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:18">8:18</a> And the LORD said to Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is in thy hand towards Ai; for I will give it into thy hand. And Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand towards the city. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:19">8:19</a> And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city, and took it, and hasted, and set the city on fire. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:20">8:20</a> And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and behold, the smoke of the city ascended to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:21">8:21</a> And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again and slew the men of Ai. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:22">8:22</a> And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:23">8:23</a> And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:24">8:24</a> And it came to pass when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness in which they chased them, and when they had all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned to Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:25">8:25</a> And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:26">8:26</a> For Joshua drew not his hand back with which he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:27">8:27</a> Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey to themselves, according to the word of the LORD which he commanded Joshua. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:28">8:28</a> And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it a heap for ever, even a desolation to this day. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:29">8:29</a> And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until evening: and as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his carcass down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city, and raise upon it a great heap of stones, that remaineth to this day. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:30">8:30</a> Then Joshua built an altar to the LORD God of Israel in mount Ebal, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:31">8:31</a> As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lifted up any iron: and they offered upon it burnt-offerings to the LORD, and sacrificed peace-offerings. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:32">8:32</a> And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:33">8:33</a> And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side of the ark, and on that side, before the priests the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, as well the stranger, as he that was born among them; half of them over against mount Gerizim, and half of them over against mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:34">8:34</a> And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:35">8:35</a> There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:1">9:1</a> And it came to pass, when all the kings who were on this side Jordan, in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the coasts of the great sea over against Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite heard these things, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:2">9:2</a> That they assembled themselves, to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:3">9:3</a> And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:4">9:4</a> They did work craftily, and went and made as if they had been embassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine-bottles, old, and rent, and bound up; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:5">9:5</a> And old shoes and patched upon their feet, and old garments upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry and moldy. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:6">9:6</a> And they went to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal, and said to him, and to the men of Israel, We have come from a far country: now therefore make ye a league with us. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:7">9:7</a> And the men of Israel said to the Hivites, It may be ye dwell among us; and how shall we make a league with you? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:8">9:8</a> And they said to Joshua, we are thy servants. And Joshua said to them, Who are ye? and whence come ye? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:9">9:9</a> And they said to him, From a very far country thy servants have come because of the name of the LORD thy God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:10">9:10</a> And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:11">9:11</a> Wherefore our elders, and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us, saying, Take provisions with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say to them, We are your servants: therefore now make ye a league with us: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:12">9:12</a> This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go to you; but now, behold, it is dry, and it is moldy: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:13">9:13</a> And these bottles of wine which we filled, were new, and behold, they are rent: and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:14">9:14</a> And the men took of their provisions, and asked not counsel at the mouth of the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:15">9:15</a> And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, to let them live: and the princes of the congregation swore to them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:16">9:16</a> And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them, that they heard that they were their neighbors, and that they dwelt among them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:17">9:17</a> And the children of Israel journeyed, and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjath-jearim. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:18">9:18</a> And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn to them by the LORD God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:19">9:19</a> But all the princes said to all the congregation, We have sworn to them by the LORD God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:20">9:20</a> This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we swore to them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:21">9:21</a> And the princes said to them, Let them live; but let them be hewers of wood, and drawers of water to all the congregation; as the princes had promised them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:22">9:22</a> And Joshua called for them, and he spoke to them, saying, Why have ye deceived us, saying, We are very far from you; when ye dwell among us? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:23">9:23</a> Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from being bond-men, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:24">9:24</a> And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how the LORD thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore we were greatly afraid for our lives because of you, and have done this thing. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:25">9:25</a> And now, behold, we are in thy hand: do as it seemeth good and right to thee to do to us, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:26">9:26</a> And so did he to them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:27">9:27</a> And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD, even to this day, in the place which he should choose. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:1">10:1</a> Now it came to pass, when Adoni-zedec king of Jerusalem had heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:2">10:2</a> That they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the men of it were mighty. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:3">10:3</a> Wherefore Adoni-zedec king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, and to Piram king of Jarmuth, and to Japhia king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:4">10:4</a> Come up to me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:5">10:5</a> Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, assembled themselves, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:6">10:6</a> And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains, are assembled against us. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:7">10:7</a> So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:8">10:8</a> And the LORD said to Joshua, Fear them not: for I have delivered them into thy hand; there shall not a man of them stand before thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:9">10:9</a> Joshua therefore came to them suddenly, and went up from Gilgal all night. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:10">10:10</a> And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goeth up to Beth-horon, and smote them to Azekah, and to Makkedah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:11">10:11</a> And it came to pass as they fled from before Israel, and were in the descent to Beth-horon, that the LORD cast down great stones from heaven upon them to Azekah, and they died: they were more who died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:12">10:12</a> Then spoke Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon, and thou Moon, in the valley of Ajalon. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:13">10:13</a> And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:14">10:14</a> And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the LORD hearkened to the voice of a man: for the LORD fought for Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:15">10:15</a> And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:16">10:16</a> But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:17">10:17</a> And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in a cave at Makkedah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:18">10:18</a> And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to keep them: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:19">10:19</a> And stay you not, but pursue your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for the LORD your God hath delivered them into your hand. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:20">10:20</a> And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, that the rest who remained of them entered into fortified cities. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:21">10:21</a> And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:22">10:22</a> Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring those five kings to me out of the cave. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:23">10:23</a> And they did so, and brought those five kings to him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:24">10:24</a> And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings to Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said to the captains of the men of war who went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:25">10:25</a> And Joshua said to them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of good courage: for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies against whom ye fight. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:26">10:26</a> And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:27">10:27</a> And it came to pass at the time of the setting of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down from the trees, and cast them into the cave in which they had been hid, and laid great stones upon the cave's mouth, which remain until this very day. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:28">10:28</a> And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king of it he utterly destroyed, them, and all the souls that were in it; he let none remain: and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did to the king of Jericho. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:29">10:29</a> Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, to Libnah, and fought against Libnah: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:30">10:30</a> And the LORD delivered it also, and its king, into the hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were in it; he let none remain in it; but did to the king of it as he did to the king of Jericho. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:31">10:31</a> And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, to Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:32">10:32</a> And the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, who took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were in it, according to all that he had done to Libnah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:33">10:33</a> Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:34">10:34</a> And from Lachish Joshua passed to Eglon, and all Israel with him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:35">10:35</a> And they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were in it he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:36">10:36</a> And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, to Hebron; and they fought against it: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:37">10:37</a> And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and its king, and all its cities, and all the souls that were in them; he left none remaining (according to all that he had done to Eglon) but destroyed it utterly, and all the souls that were in it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:38">10:38</a> And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and fought against it: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:39">10:39</a> And he took it, and its king, and all its cities, and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that were in them; he left none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to its king; as he had done also to Libnah, and to its king. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:40">10:40</a> So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of Israel commanded. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:41">10:41</a> And Joshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea even to Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even to Gibeon. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:42">10:42</a> And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time; because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:43">10:43</a> And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp in Gilgal. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:1">11:1</a> And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those things, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king Achshaph, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:2">11:2</a> And to the kings that were on the north of the mountains, and of the plains south of Cinneroth, and in the valley, and in the borders of Dor on the west, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:3">11:3</a> And to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and to the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the mountains, and to the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:4">11:4</a> And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, many people, even as the sand that is upon the sea-shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very numerous. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:5">11:5</a> And when all these kings were met together, they came and encamped together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:6">11:6</a> And the LORD said to Joshua, Be not afraid because of them: for to-morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel: thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their chariots with fire. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:7">11:7</a> So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly, and they fell upon them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:8">11:8</a> And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote them, and chased them to great Zidon, and to Misrephoth-maim, and to the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left to them none remaining. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:9">11:9</a> And Joshua did to them as the LORD bade him: he houghed their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:10">11:10</a> And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote its king with the sword: for Hazor before-time was the head of all those kingdoms. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:11">11:11</a> And they smote all the souls that were in it with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them: there was not any left to breathe: and he burnt Hazor with fire. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:12">11:12</a> And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, Joshua took, and smote them with the edge of the sword, and he utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:13">11:13</a> But as for the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:14">11:14</a> And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey to themselves: but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any to breathe. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:15">11:15</a> As the LORD commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua, and so did Joshua: he left nothing undone of all that the LORD commanded Moses. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:16">11:16</a> So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain, and the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:17">11:17</a> Even from the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even to Baal-gad, in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and smote them, and slew them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:18">11:18</a> Joshua made war a long time with all those kings. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:19">11:19</a> There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all other they took in battle. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:20">11:20</a> For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, and that they might have no favor, but that he might destroy them, as the LORD commanded Moses. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:21">11:21</a> And at that time came Joshua and cut off the Anakims from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel: Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:22">11:22</a> There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:23">11:23</a> So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD said to Moses, and Joshua gave it for an inheritance to Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from war. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:1">12:1</a> Now these are the kings of the land, whom the children of Israel smote, and possessed their land on the other side of Jordan towards the rising of the sun, from the river Arnon, to mount Hermon, and all the plain on the east: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:2">12:2</a> Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and from the middle of the river, and from half Gilead, even to the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:3">12:3</a> And from the plain to the sea of Cinneroth on the east, and to the sea of the plain, even the salt sea on the east, the way to Beth-jeshimoth; and from the south, under Ashdoth-pisgah: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:4">12:4</a> And the coast of Og king of Bashan, who was of the remnant of the giants, that dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:5">12:5</a> And reigned in mount Hermon, and in Salcah, and in all Bashan, to the border of the Geshurites, and the Maachathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:6">12:6</a> Them did Moses the servant of the LORD, and the children of Israel smite: and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it for a possession to the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:7">12:7</a> And these are the kings of the country whom Joshua and the children of Israel smote on this side of Jordan on the west, from Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon, even to the mount Halak that goeth up to Seir; which Joshua gave to the tribes of Israel for a possession according to their divisions; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:8">12:8</a> In the mountains, and in the valleys, and in the plains, and in the springs, and in the wilderness, and in the south country; the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites: </p>

 <p><a name="an_12:24">12:24</a> The king of Tirzah, one: all the kings thirty and one. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:1">13:1</a> Now Joshua was old and advanced in years; and the LORD said to him Thou art old and advanced in years, and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:2">13:2</a> This is the land that yet remaineth: all the borders of the Philistines, and all Geshuri, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:3">13:3</a> From Sihor, which is before Egypt, even to the borders of Ekron northward, which is counted to the Canaanite: five lords of the Philistines; the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avites: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:4">13:4</a> From the south all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that is beside the Sidonians, to Aphek to the borders of the Amorites: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:5">13:5</a> And the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon towards the sun-rising, from Baal-gad under mount Hermon to the entering into Hamath. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:6">13:6</a> And the inhabitants of the hill-country from Lebanon to Misrephoth-maim, and all the Sidonians, them will I drive out from before the children of Israel: only divide thou it by lot to the Israelites for an inheritance, as I have commanded thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:7">13:7</a> Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes, and the half tribe of Manasseh, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:8">13:8</a> With whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond Jordan eastward, even as Moses the servant of the LORD gave them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:9">13:9</a> From Aroer that is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the river, and all the plain of Medeba to Dibon; </p>

 <p><a name="an_13:15">13:15</a> And Moses gave to the tribe of the children of Reuben inheritance according to their families. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:16">13:16</a> And their border was from Aroer that is on the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the river, and all the plain by Medeba; </p>

 <p><a name="an_13:22">13:22</a> Balaam also the son of Beor, the sooth-sayer, did the children of Israel slay with the sword, among them that were slain by them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:23">13:23</a> And the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan, and its border. This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben after their families, the cities and their villages. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:24">13:24</a> And Moses gave inheritance to the tribe of Gad, even to the children of Gad according to their families. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:25">13:25</a> And their border was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, to Aroer that is before Rabbah; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:26">13:26</a> And from Heshbon to Ramath-mizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim to the border of Debir; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:27">13:27</a> And in the valley, Beth-aram, and Beth-nimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, Jordan and its border, even to the edge of the sea of Cinneroth, on the other side of Jordan eastward. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:28">13:28</a> This is the inheritance of the children of Gad after their families, the cities, and their villages. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:29">13:29</a> And Moses gave inheritance to the half-tribe of Manasseh: and this was the possession of the half-tribe of the children of Manasseh by their families. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:30">13:30</a> And their border was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, sixty cities: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:31">13:31</a> And half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were pertaining to the children of Machir the son of Manasseh, even to the one half of the children of Machir by their families. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:32">13:32</a> These are the countries which Moses distributed for inheritance in the plains of Moab, on the other side of Jordan by Jericho eastward. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:33">13:33</a> But to the tribe of Levi Moses gave not any inheritance: the LORD God of Israel was their inheritance, as he said to them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:1">14:1</a> And these are the countries which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel distributed for inheritance to them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:2">14:2</a> By lot was their inheritance, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half-tribe. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:3">14:3</a> For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and a half-tribe on the other side of Jordan: but to the Levites he gave no inheritance among them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:4">14:4</a> For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: therefore they gave no part to the Levites in the land, save cities to dwell in, with their suburbs for their cattle, and for their substance. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:5">14:5</a> As the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did, and they divided the land. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:6">14:6</a> Then the children of Judah came to Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said to him, Thou knowest the thing that the LORD said to Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Kadesh-barnea. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:7">14:7</a> Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadesh-barnea to explore the land; and I brought him word again as it was in my heart. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:8">14:8</a> Nevertheless, my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt: but I wholly followed the LORD my God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:9">14:9</a> And Moses swore on that day, saying, Surely the land on which thy feet have trodden shall be thy inheritance, and thy children's for ever; because thou hast wholly followed the LORD my God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:10">14:10</a> And now, behold, the LORD hath kept me alive, as he said, these forty and five years, even since the LORD spoke this word to Moses, while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness: and now, lo, I am this day eighty five years old. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:11">14:11</a> As yet I am as strong this day, as I was in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war, both to go out, and to come in. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:12">14:12</a> Now therefore give me this mountain, of which the LORD spoke in that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims were there, and that the cities were great and fortified: if the LORD will be with me, then I shall be able to drive them out, as the LORD said. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:13">14:13</a> And Joshua blessed him, and gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh Hebron for an inheritance. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:14">14:14</a> Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite to this day; because that he wholly followed the LORD God of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:15">14:15</a> And the name of Hebron before was Kirjath-arba; which Arba was a great man among the Anakims. And the land had rest from war. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:1">15:1</a> This then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by their families; even to the border of Edom, the wilderness of Zin southward was the uttermost part of the south border. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:2">15:2</a> And their south border was from the shore of the salt-sea, from the bay that looketh southward: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:3">15:3</a> And it went out to the south side to Maaleh-acrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and ascended on the south side to Kadesh-barnea, and passed along to Hezron, and went up to Adar, and fetched a compass to Karkaa: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:4">15:4</a> From thence it passed towards Azmon, and went out to the river of Egypt; and the limits of that border were at the sea: this shall be your south limit. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:5">15:5</a> And the east border was the salt-sea, even to the end of Jordan: and their border in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea, at the uttermost part of Jordan: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:6">15:6</a> And the border went up to Beth-hogla, and passed along by the north of Beth-arabah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:7">15:7</a> And the border went up towards Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward looking towards Gilgal, that is before the going up to Adummim, which is on the south side of the river: and the border passed towards the waters of En-shemesh, and the borders of it were at En-rogel: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:8">15:8</a> And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom, to the south side of the Jebusite; the same is Jerusalem: and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lieth before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the valley of the giants northward: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:9">15:9</a> And the border was drawn from the top of the hill to the fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of mount Ephron; and the border was drawn to Baalah, which is Kirjath-jearim: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:10">15:10</a> And the border compassed from Baalah westward to mount Seir, and passed along to the side of mount Jearim (which is Chesalon) on the north side, and went down to Beth-shemesh, and passed on to Timnah: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:11">15:11</a> And the border went out to the side of Ekron northward: and the border was drawn to Shicron, and passed along to mount Baalah, and went out to Jabneel; and the terminations of the border were at the sea. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:12">15:12</a> And the west border was to the great sea, and its coast: this is the border of the children of Judah round about, according to their families. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:13">15:13</a> And to Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the children of Judah, according to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua, even the city of Arba the father of Anak, which city is Hebron. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:14">15:14</a> And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:15">15:15</a> And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjath-sepher. </p>

 <p><a name="an_16:4">16:4</a> So the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their inheritance. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:5">16:5</a> And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families was thus: even the border of their inheritance on the east side was Ataroth-adar, to Beth-horon the upper: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:6">16:6</a> And the border went out towards the sea to Michmethah on the north side; and the border went about eastward to Taanath-shiloh, and passed by it on the east to Janohah; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:7">16:7</a> And it went down from Janohah to Ataroth, and to Naarath, and came to Jericho, and terminated at Jordan. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:8">16:8</a> The border went out from Tappuah westward to the river Kanah; and the limits of it were at the sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim by their families. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:9">16:9</a> And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim were among the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:10">16:10</a> And they did not expel the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer: but the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites to this day, and serve under tribute. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:1">17:1</a> There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the first-born of Joseph; to wit, for Machir the first-born of Manasseh, the father of Gilead: because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:2">17:2</a> There was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh by their families; for the children of Abiezer, and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida: these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph by their families. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:3">17:3</a> But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters: and these are the names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:4">17:4</a> And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren: therefore according to the commandment of the LORD he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:5">17:5</a> And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which were on the other side of Jordan; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:6">17:6</a> Because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons: and the rest of Manasseh's sons had the land of Gilead. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:7">17:7</a> And the border of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that lieth before Shechem; and the border went along on the right hand to the inhabitants of En-tappuah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:8">17:8</a> Now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah: but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:9">17:9</a> And the border descended to the river Kanah, southward of the river. These cities of Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh: the border of Manasseh also was on the north side of the river, and the limits of it were at the sea: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:10">17:10</a> Southward it was Ephraim's, and northward it was Manasseh's, and the sea is his border; and they met together in Asher on the north, and in Issachar on the east. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:11">17:11</a> And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Beth-shean and its towns, and Ibleam and its towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of En-dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Tanach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns, even three countries. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:12">17:12</a> Yet the children of Manasseh could not expel the inhabitants of those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:13">17:13</a> Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel had become strong, that they subjected the Canaanites to tribute; but did not utterly expel them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:14">17:14</a> And the children of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, Why hast thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I am a great people, forasmuch as the LORD hath hitherto blessed me? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:15">17:15</a> And Joshua answered them, If thou art a great people, then go up to the wood, and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the giants, if mount Ephraim is too narrow for thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:16">17:16</a> And the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both they who are of Beth-shean and its towns, and they who are of the valley of Jezreel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:17">17:17</a> And Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, Thou art a great people, and hast great power: thou shalt not have one lot only: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:18">17:18</a> But the mountain shall be thine; for it is a wood, and thou shalt cut it down: and the limits of it shall be thine: for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites, though they have iron chariots, and though they are strong. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:1">18:1</a> And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there: and the land was subdued before them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:2">18:2</a> And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes, which had not yet received their inheritance. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:3">18:3</a> And Joshua said to the children of Israel, How long are ye slack to go to possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers hath given you? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:4">18:4</a> Select from among you three men for each tribe: and I will send them, and they shall rise, and go through the land, and describe it according to the inheritance of them, and they shall come again to me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:5">18:5</a> And they shall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall abide in their border on the south, and the house of Joseph shall abide in their borders on the north. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:6">18:6</a> Ye shall therefore describe the land in seven parts, and bring the description hither to me, that I may cast lots for you here before the LORD our God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:7">18:7</a> But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of the LORD is their inheritance. And Gad, and Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:8">18:8</a> And the men arose, and departed: and Joshua charged them that went to describe the land, saying, Go, and walk through the land, and describe it, and come again to me, that I may here cast lots for you before the LORD in Shiloh. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:9">18:9</a> And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by cities in seven parts in a book, and came again, to Joshua to the host at Shiloh. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:10">18:10</a> And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD: and there Joshua divided the land to the children of Israel according to their divisions. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:11">18:11</a> And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families: and the border of their lot came forth between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:12">18:12</a> And their border on the north side was from Jordan; and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side, and went up through the mountains westward; and the limits of it were at the wilderness of Beth-aven. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:13">18:13</a> And the border went over from thence towards Luz, to the side of Luz (which is Beth-el) southward; and the border descended to Ataroth-adar, near the hill that lieth on the south side of the nether Beth-horon. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:14">18:14</a> And the border was drawn thence, and compassed the corner of the sea southward, from the hill that lieth before Beth-horon southward; and the limits of it were at Kirjath-baal (which is Kirjath-jearim) a city of the children of Judah. This was the west quarter. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:15">18:15</a> And the south quarter was from the end of Kirjah-jearim, and the border went out on the west, and went out to the well of waters of Nephtoah: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:16">18:16</a> And the border came down to the end of the mountain that lieth before the valley of the son of Hinnom, and which is in the valley of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of Jebusi on the south, and descended to En-rogel, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:17">18:17</a> And was drawn from the north, and went forth to En-shemesh, and went forth towards Geliloth, which is over against the going up of Adummim, and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:18">18:18</a> And passed along towards the side over against Arabah northward, and went down to Arabah: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:19">18:19</a> And the border passed along to the side of Beth-hoglah northward: and the limits of the border were at the north bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan. This was the south border. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:20">18:20</a> And Jordan was the border of it on the east side. This was the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the limits of it round about, according to their families. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:21">18:21</a> Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin, according to their families, were Jericho, and Beth-hoglah, and the valley of Keziz, </p>

 <p><a name="an_19:9">19:9</a> Out of the portion of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon: for the part of the children of Judah was too much for them: therefore the children of Simeon had their inheritance within the inheritance of them. </p>

 <p><a name="an_19:38">19:38</a> And Iron, and Migdal-el, Horem, and Beth-anath, and Beth-shemesh; nineteen cities with their villages. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:39">19:39</a> This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali according to their families, the cities and their villages. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:40">19:40</a> And the seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:41">19:41</a> And the border of their inheritance was Zorah, and Eshtaol, and Ir-shemesh, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:42">19:42</a> And Shaalabbim, and Ajalon, and Jethlah, </p>

 <p><a name="an_19:47">19:47</a> And the border of the children of Dan, went out too little for them: therefore the children of Dan went up to fight against Leshem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and dwelt in it, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:48">19:48</a> This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:49">19:49</a> When they had made an end of dividing the land for inheritance by their borders, the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun among them: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:50">19:50</a> According to the word of the LORD they gave him the city which he asked, even Timnath-serah in mount Ephraim: and he built the city, and dwelt in it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:51">19:51</a> These are the inheritances which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, divided for an inheritance by lot in Shiloh before the LORD, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. So they made an end of dividing the country. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:1">20:1</a> The LORD also spoke to Joshua, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:2">20:2</a> Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Appoint for you cities of refuge, of which I spoke to you by the hand of Moses: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:3">20:3</a> That the slayer that killeth any person unawares and ignorantly, may flee thither: and they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:4">20:4</a> And when he that doth flee to one of those cities shall stand at the entering of the gate of the city, and shall declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city, they shall take him into the city to them, and give him a place, that he may dwell among them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:5">20:5</a> And if the avenger of blood shall pursue him, then they shall not deliver the slayer into his hand; because he smote his neighbor ignorantly, and had not hated him before. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:6">20:6</a> And he shall dwell in that city, until he shall stand before the congregation for judgment, and until the death of the high-priest that shall be in those days: then shall the slayer return, and come to his own city, and to his own house, to the city from whence he fled. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:7">20:7</a> And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali, and Shechem in mount Ephraim, and Kirjath-arba, (which is Hebron) in the mountain of Judah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:8">20:8</a> And on the other side of Jordan by Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness upon the plain out of the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:9">20:9</a> These were the cities appointed for all the children of Israel, and for the stranger sojourning among them, that whoever should kill any person unawares might flee thither, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he stood before the congregation. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:1">21:1</a> Then came near the heads of the fathers of the Levites to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:2">21:2</a> And they spoke to them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses to give us cities to dwell in, with their suburbs for our cattle. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:3">21:3</a> And the children of Israel gave to the Levites out of their inheritance, at the commandment of the LORD, these cities and their suburbs. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:4">21:4</a> And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites: and the children of Aaron the priest, who were of the Levites, had by lot out of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of Simeon, and out of the tribe of Benjamin, thirteen cities. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:5">21:5</a> And the rest of the children of Kohath had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Ephraim, and out of the tribe of Dan, and out of the half-tribe of Manasseh, ten cities. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:6">21:6</a> And the children of Gershon had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Issachar, and out of the tribe of Asher, and out of the tribe of Naphtali, and out of the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan, thirteen cities. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:7">21:7</a> The children of Merari by their families had out of the tribe of Reuben, and out of the tribe of Gad, and out of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve cities. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:8">21:8</a> And the children of Israel gave by lot to the Levites these cities with their suburbs, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:9">21:9</a> And they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities which are here mentioned by name, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:10">21:10</a> Which the children of Aaron, being of the families of the Kohathites, who were of the children of Levi, had: for theirs was the first lot. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:11">21:11</a> And they gave them the city of Arba the father of Anak (which city is Hebron) in the hill-country of Judah, with its suburbs round it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:12">21:12</a> But the fields of the city, and its villages, they gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:13">21:13</a> Thus they gave to the children of Aaron the priest, Hebron with its suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Libnah with its suburbs, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:14">21:14</a> And Jattir with its suburbs, and Eshtemoa with its suburbs, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:15">21:15</a> And Holon with its suburbs, and Debir with its suburbs, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:16">21:16</a> And Ain with its suburbs, and Juttah with its suburbs, and Beth-shemesh with its suburbs; nine cities out of those two tribes. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:17">21:17</a> And out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with its suburbs, Geba with its suburbs, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:18">21:18</a> Anathoth with its suburbs, and Almon with its suburbs; four cities. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:19">21:19</a> All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests, were thirteen cities with their suburbs. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:20">21:20</a> And the families of the children of Kohath, the Levites who remained of the children of Kohath, even they had the cities of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:21">21:21</a> For they gave them Shechem with its suburbs in mount Ephraim, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Gezer with its suburbs, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:22">21:22</a> And Kibzaim with its suburbs, and Beth-horon with its suburbs; four cities. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:23">21:23</a> And out of the tribe of Dan, Eltekeh with its suburbs, Gibbethon with its suburbs, </p>

 <p><a name="an_21:25">21:25</a> And out of the half-tribe of Manasseh, Taanach with its suburbs, and Gath-rimmon with its suburbs; two cities. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:26">21:26</a> All the cities were ten with their suburbs, for the families of the children of Kohath that remained. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:27">21:27</a> And to the children of Gershon, of the families of the Levites, out of the other half-tribe of Manasseh they gave Golan in Bashan with its suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer, and Beesh-terah with its suburbs; two cities. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:28">21:28</a> And out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishon with its suburbs, Dabareh with its suburbs, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:29">21:29</a> Jarmuth with its suburbs, En-gannim with its suburbs; four cities. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:30">21:30</a> And out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with its suburbs, Abdon with its suburbs, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:31">21:31</a> Helkath with its suburbs, and Rehob with its suburbs; four cities. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:32">21:32</a> And out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with its suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Hammoth-dor with its suburbs, and Kartan with its suburbs; three cities. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:33">21:33</a> All the cities of the Gershonites, according to their families, were thirteen cities with their suburbs. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:34">21:34</a> And to the families of the children of Merari, the rest of the Levites, out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with its suburbs, and Kartah with its suburbs, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:35">21:35</a> Dimnah with its suburbs, Nahalal with its suburbs; four cities. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:36">21:36</a> And out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with its suburbs, and Jahazah with its suburbs, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:37">21:37</a> Kedemoth with its suburbs, and Mephaath with its suburbs; four cities. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:38">21:38</a> And out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with its suburbs to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Mahanaim with its suburbs, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:39">21:39</a> Heshbon with its suburbs, Jazer with its suburbs; four cities in all. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:40">21:40</a> So all the cities for the children of Merari by their families, which were remaining of the families of the Levites, were by their lot twelve cities. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:41">21:41</a> All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the children of Israel were forty and eight cities with their suburbs. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:42">21:42</a> These cities were every one with their suburbs around them. Thus were all these cities. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:43">21:43</a> And the LORD gave to Israel all the land which he swore to give to their fathers: and they possessed it, and dwelt in it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:44">21:44</a> And the LORD gave them rest on all sides, according to all that he swore to their fathers: and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them; the LORD delivered all their enemies into their hand. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:45">21:45</a> There failed not aught of any good thing which the LORD had spoken to the house of Israel; all came to pass. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:1">22:1</a> Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:2">22:2</a> And said to them, Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, and have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:3">22:3</a> Ye have not left your brethren these many days to this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of the LORD your God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:4">22:4</a> And now the LORD your God hath given rest to your brethren, as he promised them: therefore now return ye, and go to your tents, and to the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you on the other side of Jordan. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:5">22:5</a> But take diligent heed to perform the commandment and the law, which Moses the servant of the LORD charged you, to love the LORD your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to cleave to him, and to serve him with all your heart, and with all your soul. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:6">22:6</a> So Joshua blessed them and sent them away; and they went to their tents. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:7">22:7</a> Now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given possession in Bashan: but to the other half of it gave Joshua among their brethren on this side of Jordan westward. And when Joshua sent them away also to their tents, then he blessed them, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:8">22:8</a> And he spoke to them, saying, Return with much riches to your tents, and with very many cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:9">22:9</a> And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the country of Gilead, to the land of their possession, of which they were possessed, according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:10">22:10</a> And when they came to the borders of Jordan, that are in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan, a great altar to the sight. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:11">22:11</a> And the children of Israel heard it said, Behold, the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, have built an altar over against the land of Canaan, in the borders of Jordan, at the passage of the children of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:12">22:12</a> And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled at Shiloh, to go up to war against them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:13">22:13</a> And the children of Israel sent to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:14">22:14</a> And with him ten princes, of each chief house a prince throughout all the tribes of Israel; and each one was a head of the house of their fathers among the thousands of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:15">22:15</a> And they came to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead, and they spoke with them, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:16">22:16</a> Thus saith the whole congregation of the LORD, What trespass is this that ye have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from following the LORD, in that ye have built you an altar, that ye might rebel this day against the LORD? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:17">22:17</a> Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we are not cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in the congregation of the LORD, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:18">22:18</a> But that ye must turn away this day from following the LORD? and it will be, seeing ye rebel to-day against the LORD, that to-morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:19">22:19</a> Not withstanding, if the land of your possession is unclean, then pass ye over to the land of the possession of the LORD, in which the LORD'S tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession among us: but rebel not against the LORD, nor rebel against us, in building you an altar besides the altar of the LORD our God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:20">22:20</a> Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing, and wrath fall on all the congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:21">22:21</a> Then the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered, and said to the heads of the thousands of Israel, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:22">22:22</a> The LORD God of gods, the LORD God of gods, he knoweth, and Israel he shall know; if it is in rebellion, or if in transgression against the LORD, (save us not this day,) </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:23">22:23</a> That we have built us an altar to turn from following the LORD, or if to offer on it burnt-offering, or meat-offering, or if to offer peace-offerings on it, let the LORD himself require it; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:24">22:24</a> And if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing, saying, In time to come your children may speak to our children, saying, What have ye to do with the LORD God of Israel? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:25">22:25</a> For the LORD hath made Jordan a boundary between us and you, ye children of Reuben and children of Gad; ye have no part in the LORD. So shall your children make our children cease from fearing the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:26">22:26</a> Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt-offering, nor for sacrifice: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:27">22:27</a> But that it may be a witness between us, and you, and our generations after us, that we may do the service of the LORD before him with our burnt-offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace-offerings; that your children may not say to our children in time to come, Ye have no part in the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:28">22:28</a> Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they shall so say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we may say, Behold the pattern of the altar of the LORD, which our fathers made, not for burnt-offerings, nor for sacrifices; but it is a witness between us and you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:29">22:29</a> Far be it from us that we should rebel against the LORD, and turn this day from following the LORD, to build an altar for burnt-offerings, for meat-offerings, or for sacrifices, besides the altar of the LORD our God that is before his tabernacle. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:30">22:30</a> And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation, and heads of the thousands of Israel who were with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the children of Manasseh spoke, it pleased them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:31">22:31</a> And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, This day we perceive that the LORD is among us, because ye have not committed this trespass against the LORD: now ye have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:32">22:32</a> And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, from the land of Gilead, to the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:33">22:33</a> And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and did not intend to go up against them in battle, to destroy the land in which the children of Reuben and Gad dwelt. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:34">22:34</a> And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar Ed: for it shall be a witness between us that the LORD is God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:1">23:1</a> And it came to pass, a long time after that the LORD had given rest to Israel from all their enemies on all sides, that Joshua became old and advanced in age. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:2">23:2</a> And Joshua called for all Israel, and for their elders, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and said to them, I am old and advanced in age: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:3">23:3</a> And ye have seen all that the LORD your God hath done to all these nations because of you; for the LORD your God is he that hath fought for you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:4">23:4</a> Behold, I have divided to you by lot these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even to the great sea westward. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:5">23:5</a> And the LORD your God, he shall expel them from before you, and drive them from your sight; and ye shall possess their land, as the LORD your God hath promised to you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:6">23:6</a> Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside from it to the right hand or to the left; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:7">23:7</a> That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves to them: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:8">23:8</a> But cleave to the LORD your God, as ye have done to this day. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:9">23:9</a> For the LORD hath driven out from before you great nations and strong: but as for you, no man hath been able to stand before you to this day. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:10">23:10</a> One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the LORD your God, he it is that fighteth for you, as he hath promised you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:11">23:11</a> Take good heed therefore to yourselves, that ye love the LORD your God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:12">23:12</a> Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave to the remnant of these nations, even these that remain among you, and shall make marriages with them, and associate with them, and they with you: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:13">23:13</a> Know for a certainty that the LORD your God will no more drive out any of these nations from before you; but they shall be snares and traps to you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:14">23:14</a> And behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth; and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the LORD your God spoke concerning you: all are come to pass to you, and not one thing hath failed of it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:15">23:15</a> Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all good things are come upon you, which the LORD your God promised you; so shall the LORD bring upon you all evil things, until he hath destroyed you from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:16">23:16</a> When ye have transgressed the covenant of the LORD your God, which he commanded you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them; then shall the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given to you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:1">24:1</a> And Joshua convened all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:2">24:2</a> And Joshua said to all the people, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nahor: and they served other gods. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:3">24:3</a> And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:4">24:4</a> And I gave to Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave to Esau mount Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:5">24:5</a> I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:6">24:6</a> And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came to the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen to the Red sea. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:7">24:7</a> And when they cried to the LORD, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt: and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:8">24:8</a> And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, who dwelt on the other side of Jordan, and they fought with you: and I gave them into your hand, that ye might possess their land; and I destroyed them from before you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:9">24:9</a> Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:10">24:10</a> But I would not hearken to Balaam; therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out of his hand. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:11">24:11</a> And ye went over Jordan, and came to Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, and I delivered them into your hand. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:12">24:12</a> And I sent the hornet before you, which drove them out from before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; but not with thy sword, nor with thy bow. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:13">24:13</a> And I have given you a land for which ye did not labor, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards and olive-yards which ye planted not do ye eat. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:14">24:14</a> Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth; and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:15">24:15</a> And if it seemeth evil to you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve, whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:16">24:16</a> And the people answered, and said, Be it far from us that we should forsake the LORD, to serve other gods; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:17">24:17</a> For the LORD our God, he it is that brought us, and our fathers, out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and who did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way in which we went, and among all the people through whom we passed: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:18">24:18</a> And the LORD drove out from before us all the people, even the Amorites who dwelt in the land: therefore will we also serve the LORD; for he is our God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:19">24:19</a> And Joshua said to the people, Ye cannot serve the LORD: for he is a holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions, nor your sins. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:20">24:20</a> If ye forsake the LORD, and serve strange gods, then he will turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done you good. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:21">24:21</a> And the people said to Joshua, No; but we will serve the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:22">24:22</a> And Joshua said to the people, Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the LORD, to serve him. And they said, We are witnesses. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:23">24:23</a> Now therefore put away (said he) the strange gods which are among you, and incline your heart to the LORD God of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:24">24:24</a> And the people said to Joshua, The LORD our God will we serve, and his voice will we obey. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:25">24:25</a> So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:26">24:26</a> And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak that was by the sanctuary of the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:27">24:27</a> And Joshua said to all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness to us; for it hath heard all the words of the LORD which he spoke to us, it shall be therefore a witness to you, lest ye deny your God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:28">24:28</a> So Joshua let the people depart, every man to his inheritance. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:29">24:29</a> And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun the servant of the LORD died, being a hundred and ten years old. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:30">24:30</a> And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-serah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of Gaash. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:31">24:31</a> And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, and who had known all the works of the LORD that he had done for Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:32">24:32</a> And the bones of Joseph which the children of Israel brought out of Egypt, they buried in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for a hundred pieces of silver; and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:33">24:33</a> And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill that pertained to Phinehas his son, which was given him in mount Ephraim. </p>
