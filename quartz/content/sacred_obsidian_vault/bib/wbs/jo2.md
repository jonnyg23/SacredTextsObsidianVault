  <h3 align="center">Webster's Bible: 2 John</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> The elder to the elect lady, and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> For the truth's sake which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> Grace be with you, mercy, and peace from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> I rejoiced greatly, that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment to thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> And this is love, that we walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, that as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> For many deceivers have entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver, and an antichrist. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> Whoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> If any one cometh to you, and bringeth not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither wish him happiness: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> For he that wisheth him happiness, is partaker of his evil deeds. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> Having many things to write to you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come to you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen. </p>
