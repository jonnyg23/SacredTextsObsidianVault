  <h3 align="center">Webster's Bible: Philemon</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellow-laborer, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellow-soldier, and to the church in thy house: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast towards the Lord Jesus, and towards all saints; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> Wherefore, though I might be very bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> Who in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, my own bowels: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered to me in the bonds of the gospel: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> But without thy mind I would do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldst receive him for ever; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more to thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> If thou accountest me therefore a partner, receive him as myself. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee aught, put that on my account; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:19">1:19</a> I Paul have written it with my own hand, I will repay it: although I do not say to thee that thou owest to me even thy own self besides. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:20">1:20</a> Yes, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:21">1:21</a> Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote to thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:22">1:22</a> But at the same time prepare me also a lodging; for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given to you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:23">1:23</a> There salute thee Epaphras, my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:24">1:24</a> Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellow-laborers. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:25">1:25</a> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen. </p>
