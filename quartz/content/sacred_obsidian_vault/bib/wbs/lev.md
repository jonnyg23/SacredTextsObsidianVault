 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> And the LORD called to Moses, and spoke to him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, If any man of you shall bring an offering to the LORD, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, even of the herd, and of the flock. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> If his offering shall be a burnt-sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt-offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood around upon the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> And he shall flay the burnt-offering, and cut it into its pieces, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay the wood in order upon the fire. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> And the priests, Aaron's sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall burn all on the altar, to be a burnt-sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt-sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without blemish. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall sprinkle his blood around upon the altar: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> And he shall cut it into its pieces, with its head and its fat: and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> But he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water: and the priest shall bring it all, and burn it upon the altar: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD shall be of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtle doves, or of young pigeons. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> And the priest shall bring it to the altar, and wring off its head, and burn it on the altar: and its blood shall be wrung out at the side of the altar: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> And he shall pluck away its crop with its feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, by the place of the ashes: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> And he shall cleave it with its wings, but shall not divide it asunder: and the priest shall burn it upon the altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> And when any will offer a meat-offering to the LORD, his offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense upon it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests: and he shall take out of it his handful of its flour, and of its oil, with all its frankincense; and the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar, to be an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to the LORD: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> And the remnant of the meat-offering shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> And if thou shalt bring an oblation of a meat-offering baked in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> And if thy oblation shall be a meat-offering baked in a pan, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil. </p>

 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> And if thy oblation shall be a meat-offering baked in the frying-pan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> And thou shalt bring the meat-offering that is made of these things to the LORD: and when it is presented to the priest, he shall bring it to the altar. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> And the priest shall take from the meat-offering a memorial of it, and shall burn it upon the altar: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> And that which is left of the meat-offering shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is a thing most holy, of the offerings of the LORD made by fire. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> No meat-offering which ye shall bring to the LORD shall be made with leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any offering of the LORD made by fire. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> As for the oblation of the first-fruits, ye shall offer them to the LORD: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savor. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> And every oblation of thy meat-offering shalt thou season with salt: neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meat-offering: with all thy offerings thou shalt offer salt. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> And if thou shalt offer a meat-offering of thy first-fruits to the LORD, thou shalt offer for the meat-offering of thy first-fruits, green ears of corn dried by the fire, even corn beaten out of full ears. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense upon it: it is a meat-offering. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of its beaten corn, and part of its oil, with all its frankincense: it is an offering made by fire to the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> And if his oblation shall be a sacrifice of peace-offering, if he shall offer it of the herd, whether a male or female; he shall offer it without blemish before the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace-offering, an offering made by fire to the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> And Aaron's sons shall burn it on the altar, upon the burnt-sacrifice which is upon the wood that is on the fire: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to the LORD. </p>

 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace-offering an offering made by fire to the LORD: its fat, and the whole rump, that shall he take off hard by the back-bone; and the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, that shall he take away. </p>

 <p><a name="an_8:21">8:21</a> And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt-sacrifice for a sweet savor, and an offering made by fire to the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:22">8:22</a> And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram. </p>

 <p><a name="an_9:1">9:1</a> And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:2">9:2</a> And he said to Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering, without blemish, and offer them before the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:3">9:3</a> And to the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin-offering; and a calf and a lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt-offering; </p>

 <p><a name="an_9:5">9:5</a> And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:6">9:6</a> And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commanded that ye should do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear to you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:7">9:7</a> And Moses said to Aaron, Go to the altar, and offer thy sin-offering, and thy burnt-offering, and make an atonement for thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the LORD commanded. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:8">9:8</a> Aaron therefore went to the altar, and slew the calf of the sin-offering, which was for himself. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:9">9:9</a> And the sons of Aaron brought the blood to him: and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:10">9:10</a> But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin-offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:11">9:11</a> And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:12">9:12</a> And he slew the burnt-offering; and Aaron's sons presented to him the blood, which he sprinkled around upon the altar. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:13">9:13</a> And they presented the burnt-offering to him, with the pieces of it, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:14">9:14</a> And he washed the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the burnt-offering on the altar. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:15">9:15</a> And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which was the sin-offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:16">9:16</a> And he brought the burnt-offering, and offered it according to the manner. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:17">9:17</a> And he brought the meat-offering, and took a handful of it, and burnt it upon the altar, beside the burnt-sacrifice of the morning. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:18">9:18</a> He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace-offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron's sons presented to him the blood, which he sprinkled around upon the altar, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:19">9:19</a> And the fat of the bullock, and of the ram, the rump, and that which covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:20">9:20</a> And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar: </p>

 <p><a name="an_9:22">9:22</a> And Aaron lifted up his hand towards the people, and blessed them; and came down from offering the sin-offering, and the burnt-offering, and peace-offerings. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:23">9:23</a> And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD appeared to all the people. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:24">9:24</a> And there came out a fire from before the LORD, and consumed upon the altar the burnt-offering and the fat: which, when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:1">10:1</a> And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took each of them his censer, and put fire in it, and put incense on it, and offered strange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them not. </p>

 <p><a name="an_10:6">10:6</a> And Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the LORD hath kindled. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:7">10:7</a> And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the LORD is upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses. </p>

 <p><a name="an_10:13">10:13</a> And ye shall eat it in the holy place, because it is thy due, and thy sons' due, of the sacrifices of the LORD made by fire: for so I am commanded. </p>

 <p><a name="an_10:15">10:15</a> The heave-shoulder and the wave-breast shall they bring, with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave-offering before the LORD; and it shall be thine, and thy sons' with thee, by a statute for ever; as the LORD hath commanded. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:16">10:16</a> And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin-offering, and behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron who were left alive, saying, </p>

 <p><a name="an_26:17">26:17</a> And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you, and ye shall flee when none pursueth you. </p>

 <p><a name="an_26:25">26:25</a> And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant: and when ye are gathered within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you: and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:26">26:26</a> And when I have broke the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied. </p>

 <p><a name="an_26:36">26:36</a> And upon them that are left alive of you, I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall, when none pursueth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:37">26:37</a> And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies. </p>

 <p><a name="an_26:42">26:42</a> Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:43">26:43</a> The land also shall be left by them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity; because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:44">26:44</a> And yet for all that, when they shall be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them; for I am the LORD their God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:45">26:45</a> But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the LORD. </p>

 <p><a name="an_27:3">27:3</a> And thy estimation shall be, of the male from twenty years old even to sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:4">27:4</a> And if it shall be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:5">27:5</a> And if it shall be from five years old even to twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:6">27:6</a> And if it shall be from a month old even to five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:7">27:7</a> And if it shall be from sixty years old and above; if a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:8">27:8</a> But if he shall be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him: according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:9">27:9</a> And if it shall be a beast of which men bring an offering to the LORD, all that any man giveth of such to the LORD shall be holy. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:10">27:10</a> He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the exchange of it shall be holy. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:11">27:11</a> And if it shall be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a sacrifice to the LORD, then he shall present the beast before the priest: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:12">27:12</a> And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as thou valuest it, who art the priest, so shall it be. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:13">27:13</a> But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth part of it to thy estimation. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:14">27:14</a> And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy to the LORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it is good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand. </p>

 <p><a name="an_27:19">27:19</a> And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation to it, and it shall be assured to him. </p>

 <p><a name="an_27:27">27:27</a> And if it shall be of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it, according to thy estimation, and shall add to it a fifth part of it: or if it shall be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:28">27:28</a> Notwithstanding, no devoted thing that a man shall devote to the LORD of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy to the LORD. </p>
