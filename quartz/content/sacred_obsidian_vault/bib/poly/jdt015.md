 <p align="center"><a href="../apo/jdt015.htm">Apo</a></p><p>1 And when they that were in the tents heard, they were astonished at the thing that was done. </p>
 <p>2 And fear and trembling fell upon them, so that there was no man that durst abide in the sight of his neighbour, but rushing out all together, they fled into every way of the plain, and of the hill country. </p>
 <p>3 They also that had camped in the mountains round about Bethulia fled away. Then the children of Israel, every one that was a warrior among them, rushed out upon them. </p>
 <p>4 Then sent Ozias to Betomasthem, and to Bebai, and Chobai, and Cola and to all the coasts of Israel, such as should tell the things that were done, and that all should rush forth upon their enemies to destroy them. </p>
 <p>5 Now when the children of Israel heard it, they all fell upon them with one consent, and slew them unto Chobai: likewise also they that came from Jerusalem, and from all the hill country, (for men had told them what things were done in the camp of their enemies) and they that were in Galaad, and in Galilee, chased them with a great slaughter, until they were past Damascus and the borders thereof. </p>
 <p>6 And the residue that dwelt at Bethulia, fell upon the camp of Assur, and spoiled them, and were greatly enriched. </p>
 <p>7 And the children of Israel that returned from the slaughter had that which remained; and the villages and the cities, that were in the mountains and in the plain, gat many spoils: for the multitude was very great. </p>
 <p>8 Then Joacim the high priest, and the ancients of the children of Israel that dwelt in Jerusalem, came to behold the good things that God had shewed to Israel, and to see Judith, and to salute her. </p>
 <p>9 And when they came unto her, they blessed her with one accord, and said unto her, Thou art the exaltation of Jerusalem, thou art the great glory of Israel, thou art the great rejoicing of our nation: </p>
 <p>10 Thou hast done all these things by thine hand: thou hast done much good to Israel, and God is pleased therewith: blessed be thou of the Almighty Lord for evermore. And all the people said, So be it. </p>
 <p>11 And the people spoiled the camp the space of thirty days: and they gave unto Judith Holofernes his tent, and all his plate, and beds, and vessels, and all his stuff: and she took it and laid it on her mule; and made ready her carts, and laid them thereon. </p>
 <p>12 Then all the women of Israel ran together to see her, and blessed her, and made a dance among them for her: and she took branches in her hand, and gave also to the women that were with her. </p>
 <p>13 And they put a garland of olive upon her and her maid that was with her, and she went before all the people in the dance, leading all the women: and all the men of Israel followed in their armour with garlands, and with songs in their mouths. </p>

 <p>2 καὶ ἐπέπεσεν ἐπ᾽ αὐτοὺς τρόμος καὶ φόβος καὶ οὐκ ἦν ἄνθρωπος μένων κατὰ πρόσωπον τοῦ πλησίον ἔτι ἀλλ᾽ ἐκχυθέντες ὁμοθυμαδὸν ἔφευγον ἐπὶ πᾶσαν ὁδὸν τοῦ πεδίου καὶ τῆς ὀρεινῆς </p>
 <p>3 καὶ οἱ παρεμβεβληκότες ἐν τῇ ὀρεινῇ κύκλῳ Βαιτυλουα καὶ ἐτράπησαν εἰς φυγήν καὶ τότε οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ πᾶς ἀνὴρ πολεμιστὴς ἐξ αὐτῶν ἐξεχύθησαν ἐπ᾽ αὐτούς </p>
 <p>4 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Οζιας εἰς Βαιτομασθαιμ καὶ Βηβαι καὶ Χωβαι καὶ Κωλα καὶ εἰς πᾶν ὅριον Ισραηλ τοὺς ἀπαγγέλλοντας ὑπὲρ τῶν συντετελεσμένων καὶ ἵνα πάντες ἐπεκχυθῶσιν τοῖς πολεμίοις εἰς τὴν ἀναίρεσιν αὐτῶν </p>
 <p>5 ὡς δὲ ἤκουσαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ πάντες ὁμοθυμαδὸν ἐπέπεσον ἐπ᾽ αὐτοὺς καὶ ἔκοπτον αὐτοὺς ἕως Χωβα ὡσαύτως δὲ καὶ οἱ ἐξ Ιερουσαλημ παρεγενήθησαν καὶ ἐκ πάσης τῆς ὀρεινῆς ἀνήγγειλαν γὰρ αὐτοῖς τὰ γεγονότα τῇ παρεμβολῇ τῶν ἐχθρῶν αὐτῶν καὶ οἱ ἐν Γαλααδ καὶ οἱ ἐν τῇ Γαλιλαίᾳ ὑπερεκέρασαν αὐτοὺς πληγῇ μεγάλῃ ἕως οὗ παρῆλθον Δαμασκὸν καὶ τὰ ὅρια αὐτῆς </p>
 <p>6 οἱ δὲ λοιποὶ οἱ κατοικοῦντες Βαιτυλουα ἐπέπεσαν τῇ παρεμβολῇ Ασσουρ καὶ ἐπρονόμευσαν αὐτοὺς καὶ ἐπλούτησαν σφόδρα </p>
 <p>7 οἱ δὲ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ ἀναστρέψαντες ἀπὸ τῆς κοπῆς ἐκυρίευσαν τῶν λοιπῶν καὶ αἱ κῶμαι καὶ ἐπαύλεις ἐν τῇ ὀρεινῇ καὶ πεδινῇ ἐκράτησαν πολλῶν λαφύρων ἦν γὰρ πλῆθος πολὺ σφόδρα </p>
 <p>8 καὶ Ιωακιμ ὁ ἱερεὺς ὁ μέγας καὶ ἡ γερουσία τῶν υἱῶν Ισραηλ οἱ κατοικοῦντες ἐν Ιερουσαλημ ἦλθον τοῦ θεάσασθαι τὰ ἀγαθά ἃ ἐποίησεν κύριος τῷ Ισραηλ καὶ τοῦ ἰδεῖν τὴν Ιουδιθ καὶ λαλῆσαι μετ᾽ αὐτῆς εἰρήνην </p>
 <p>9 ὡς δὲ εἰσῆλθον πρὸς αὐτήν εὐλόγησαν αὐτὴν πάντες ὁμοθυμαδὸν καὶ εἶπαν πρὸς αὐτήν σὺ ὕψωμα Ιερουσαλημ σὺ γαυρίαμα μέγα τοῦ Ισραηλ σὺ καύχημα μέγα τοῦ γένους ἡμῶν </p>
 <p>10 ἐποίησας ταῦτα πάντα ἐν χειρί σου ἐποίησας τὰ ἀγαθὰ μετὰ Ισραηλ καὶ εὐδόκησεν ἐπ᾽ αὐτοῖς ὁ θεός εὐλογημένη γίνου παρὰ τῷ παντοκράτορι κυρίῳ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα χρόνον καὶ εἶπεν πᾶς ὁ λαός γένοιτο </p>
 <p>11 καὶ ἐλαφύρευσεν πᾶς ὁ λαὸς τὴν παρεμβολὴν ἐφ᾽ ἡμέρας τριάκοντα καὶ ἔδωκαν τῇ Ιουδιθ τὴν σκηνὴν Ολοφέρνου καὶ πάντα τὰ ἀργυρώματα καὶ τὰς κλίνας καὶ τὰ ὁλκεῖα καὶ πάντα τὰ κατασκευάσματα αὐτοῦ καὶ λαβοῦσα αὐτὴ ἐπέθηκεν ἐπὶ τὴν ἡμίονον αὐτῆς καὶ ἔζευξεν τὰς ἁμάξας αὐτῆς καὶ ἐσώρευσεν αὐτὰ ἐπ᾽ αὐτῶν </p>
 <p>12 καὶ συνέδραμεν πᾶσα γυνὴ Ισραηλ τοῦ ἰδεῖν αὐτὴν καὶ εὐλόγησαν αὐτὴν καὶ ἐποίησαν αὐτῇ χορὸν ἐξ αὐτῶν καὶ ἔλαβεν θύρσους ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν αὐτῆς καὶ ἔδωκεν ταῖς γυναιξὶν ταῖς μετ᾽ αὐτῆς </p>
 <p>13 καὶ ἐστεφανώσαντο τὴν ἐλαίαν αὐτὴ καὶ αἱ μετ᾽ αὐτῆς καὶ προῆλθεν παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ ἐν χορείᾳ ἡγουμένη πασῶν τῶν γυναικῶν καὶ ἠκολούθει πᾶς ἀνὴρ Ισραηλ ἐνωπλισμένοι μετὰ στεφάνων καὶ ὕμνουν ἐν τῷ στόματι αὐτῶν </p>
 <p>14 καὶ ἐξῆρχεν Ιουδιθ τὴν ἐξομολόγησιν ταύτην ἐν παντὶ Ισραηλ καὶ ὑπερεφώνει πᾶς ὁ λαὸς τὴν αἴνεσιν ταύτην </p>

 <p align="center"><a href="../vul/jdt015.htm">Vul</a></p><p>1 Cumque omnis exercitus decollatum Holofernem audisset, fugit mens et consilium ab eis, et solo tremore et metu agitati, fugæ præsidium sumunt,</p>
 <p>2 ita ut nullus loqueretur cum proximo suo, sed inclinato capite, relictis omnibus, evadere festinabant Hebræos, quos armatos super se venire audiebant, fugientes per vias camporum et semitas collium.</p>
 <p>3 Videntes itaque filii Israël fugientes, secuti sunt illos. Descenderuntque clangentes tubis, et ululantes post ipsos.</p>
 <p>4 Et quoniam Assyrii non adunati, in fugam ibant præcipites: filii autem Israël uno agmine persequentes debilitabant omnes quos invenire potuissent.</p>
 <p>5 Misit itaque Ozias nuntios per omnes civitates et regiones Israël.</p>
 <p>6 Omnis itaque regio, omnisque urbs electam juventutem armatam misit post eos, et persecuti sunt eos in ore gladii, quousque pervenirent ad extremitatem finium suorum.</p>
 <p>7 Reliqui autem qui erant in Bethulia, ingressi sunt castra Assyriorum, et prædam quam fugientes Assyrii reliquerant, abstulerunt, et onustati sunt valde.</p>
 <p>8 Hi vero qui victores reversi sunt ad Bethuliam, omnia quæ erant illorum attulerunt secum, ita ut non esset numerus in pecoribus et jumentis et universis mobilibus eorum, ut a minimo usque ad maximum omnes divites fierent de prædationibus eorum.<br>
 </p>
 <p>9 Joacim autem summus pontifex de Jerusalem venit in Bethuliam cum universis presbyteris suis ut videret Judith.</p>
 <p>10 Quæ cum exisset ad illum, benedixerunt eam omnes una voce, dicentes: Tu gloria Jerusalem; tu lætitia Israël; tu honorificentia populi nostri:</p>
 <p>11 quia fecisti viriliter, et confortatum est cor tuum, eo quod castitatem amaveris, et post virum tuum, alterum nescieris: ideo et manus Domini confortavit te, et ideo eris benedicta in æternum.</p>
 <p>12 Et dixit omnis populus: Fiat, fiat.</p>
 <p>13 Per dies autem triginta, vix collecta sunt spolia Assyriorum a populo Israël.</p>
 <p>14 Porro autem universa quæ Holofernis peculiaria fuisse probata sunt, dederunt Judith in auro, et argento, et vestibus, et gemmis, et omni supellectili: et tradita sunt omnia illi a populo.</p>
 <p>15 Et omnes populi gaudebant cum mulieribus, et virginibus, et juvenibus, in organis et citharis.</p>
