  <p>G4496<br>  ῥίπτω  <br> rhiptō̄  <br><i>hrip‘-to </i><br>A primary verb (perhaps rather akin to the base of <a href="g4474.htm">4474</a>  through the idea of sudden <i>motion</i>); to <i>fling</i> (properly with a quick <i>toss</i>, thus differing from <a href="g0906.htm">906</a>  which denotes a <i>deliberate</i> hurl; and from   τείνω    teinō   (see in <a href="g1614.htm">1614</a> , which indicates an <i>extended</i> projection); by qualification, to <i>deposit</i> (as if a load); by extension to <i>disperse:</i> - cast (down, out), scatter abroad, throw.<br></p>
