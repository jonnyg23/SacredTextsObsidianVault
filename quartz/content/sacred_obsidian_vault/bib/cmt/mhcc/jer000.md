 <p>Jeremiah was a priest, a native of Anathoth, in the tribe of Benjamin. He was called to the prophetic office when very young, about seventy years after the death of Isaiah, and exercised it for about forty years with great faithfulness, till the sins of the Jewish nation came to their full measure and destruction followed. The prophecies of Jeremiah do not stand as they were delivered. Blayney has endeavoured to arrange them in more regular order, namely, ch. 1-20; 22; 23; 25; 26; 35; 36; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#001">Jer 45:1-5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#001">Jer 24:1-10</a>; 29; 30; 31; 27; 28; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#001">Jer 21:1-14</a>; 34; 37; 32; 33; 38; 39; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#015">Jer 39:15-18</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#001">Jer 39:1-14</a>.) 40-44; 46-52. The general subject of his prophecies is the idolatry and other sins of the Jews; the judgments by which they were threatened, with references to their future restoration and deliverance, and promises of the Messiah. They are remarkable for plain and faithful reproofs, affectionate expostulations, and awful warnings.
