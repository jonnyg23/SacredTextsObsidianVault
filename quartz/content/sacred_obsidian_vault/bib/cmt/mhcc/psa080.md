 <p>(<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#001">Psa 80:1-7</a>) The psalmist complains of the miseries of the church.
 </p><p>(<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#008">Psa 80:8-16</a>) Its former prosperity and present desolation.
 </p><p>(<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#017">Psa 80:17-19</a>) A prayer for mercy. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#001">Psalms 80:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">psa 80:1</a></font></span></p>
 <p>He that dwelleth upon the mercy-seat, is the good Shepherd of his people. But we can neither expect the comfort of his love, nor the protection of his arm, unless we partake of his converting grace. If he is really angry at the prayers of his people, it is because, although they pray, their ends are not right, or there is some secret sin indulged in them, or he will try their patience and perseverance in prayer. When God is displeased with his people, we must expect to see them in tears, and their enemies in triumph. There is no salvation but from God's favour; there is no conversion to God but by his own grace. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#008">Psalms 80:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">psa 80:8</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The church is represented as a vine and a vineyard. The root of this vine is Christ, the branches are believers. The church is like a vine, needing support, but spreading and fruitful. If a vine do not bring forth fruit, no tree is so worthless. And are not we planted as in a well-cultivated garden, with every means of being fruitful in works of righteousness? But the useless leaves of profession, and the empty boughs of notions and forms, abound far more than real piety. It was wasted and ruined. There was a good reason for this change in God's way toward them. And it is well or ill with us, according as we are under God's smiles or frowns. When we consider the state of the purest part of the visible church, we cannot wonder that it is visited with sharp corrections. They request that God would help the vine. Lord, it is formed by thyself, and for thyself, therefore it may, with humble confidence, be committed to thyself. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#017">Psalms 80:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">psa 80:17</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The Messiah, the Protector and Saviour of the church, is the Man of God's right hand; he is the Arm of the Lord, for all power is given to him. In him is our strength, by which we are enabled to persevere to the end. The vine, therefore, cannot be ruined, nor can any fruitful branch perish; but the unfruitful will be cut off and cast into the fire. The end of our redemption is, that we should serve Him who hath redeemed us, and not go back to our old sins.
