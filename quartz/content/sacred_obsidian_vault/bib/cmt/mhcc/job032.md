 <p>(<a href="../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#001">Job 32:1-5</a>) Elihu is displeased at the dispute between Job and his friends.
 </p><p>(<a href="../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#006">Job 32:6-14</a>) He reproves them.
 </p><p>(<a href="../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#015">Job 32:15-22</a>) He speaks without partiality. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#001">Job 32:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">job 32:1</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Job's friends were silenced, but not convinced. Others had been present. Elihu was justly displeased with Job, as more anxious to clear his own character than the justice and goodness of God. Elihu was displeased with Job's friends because they had not been candid to Job. Seldom is a quarrel begun, more seldom is a quarrel carried on, in which there are not faults on both sides. Those that seek for truth, must not reject what is true and good on either side, nor approve or defend what is wrong. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#006">Job 32:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">job 32:6</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Elihu professes to speak by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, and corrects both parties. He allowed that those who had the longest experience should speak first. But God gives wisdom as he pleases; this encouraged him to state his opinion. By attention to the word of God, and dependence upon the Holy Spirit, young men may become wiser than the aged; but this wisdom will render them swift to hear, slow to speak, and disposed to give others a patient hearing. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#015">Job 32:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">job 32:15</a></font></span></p>
 <p>If we are sure that the Spirit of God suggested what we are about to say, still we ought to refrain, till it comes to our turn to speak. God is the God of order, not of confusion. It is great refreshment to a good man, to speak for the glory of the Lord, and to edify others. And the more we consider the majesty of God, as our Maker, and the more we dread his wrath and justice, the less shall we sinfully fear or flatter men. Could we set the wrath Lord always before us, in his mercies and his terrors, we should not be moved from doing our duty in whatever we are called to do.
