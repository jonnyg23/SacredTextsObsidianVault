 <p>To continue to lament for so bad a son as Absalom, was very unwise, and very unworthy. Joab censures David, but not with proper respect and deference to his sovereign. A plain case may be fairly pleaded with those above us, and they may be reproved for what they do amiss, but it must not be with rudeness and insolence. Yet David took the reproof and the counsel, prudently and mildly. Timely giving way, usually prevents the ill effects of mistaken measures. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#009">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">sa2 19:9</a></font></span></p>
 <p>God's providence, by the priests' persuasions and Amasa's interest, brought the people to resolve the recall of the king. David stirred not till he received this invitation. Our Lord Jesus will rule in those that invite him to the throne in their hearts, and not till he is invited. He first bows the heart, and makes it willing in the day of his power, then rules in the midst of his enemies, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#002">Psa 110:2</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#003">Psa 110:3</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#016">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">sa2 19:16</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Those who now slight and abuse the Son of David, would be glad to make their peace when he shall come in his glory; but it will be too late. Shimei lost no time. His abuse had been personal, and with the usual right feeling of good men, David could more easily forgive it. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#024">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">sa2 19:24</a></font></span></p>
 <p>David recalls the forfeiture of Mephibosheth's estate; and he expressed joy for the king's return. A good man contentedly bears his own losses, while he sees Israel in peace, and the Son of David exalted. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#031">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:31</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_031">sa2 19:31</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Barzillai thought he had done himself honour in doing the king any service. Thus, when the saints shall be called to inherit the kingdom, they will be amazed at the recompence being so very far beyond the service, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#037">Mat 25:37</a>. A good man would not go any where to be burdensome; or, will rather be so to his own house than to another's. It is good for all, but especially becomes old people, to think and speak much of dying. The grave is ready for me, let me go and get ready for it. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#040">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:40</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_040">sa2 19:40</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The men of Israel though themselves despised, and the fiercer words of the men of Judah produced very bad effects. Much evil might be avoided, if men would watch against pride, and remember that a soft answer turneth away wrath. Though we have right and reason on our side, if we speak it with fierceness, God is displeased.
