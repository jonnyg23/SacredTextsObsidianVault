 <p>By the significant type of breaking a potter's vessel, Jeremiah is directed to predict the utter desolation of Judah and Jerusalem, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#001">Jer 19:1-15</a>. The prophets taught frequently by symbolic actions as well as by words. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#001">Jeremiah 19:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">jer 19:1</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Go and get a potter's earthen bottle - This discourse was also delivered some time in the reign of Jehoiakim. Under the type of breaking a potter's earthen bottle or jug, Jeremiah shows his enemies that the word of the Lord should stand, that Jerusalem should be taken and sacked, and they all carried into captivity.
 </p><p>Ancients of the priests - The chiefs of the twenty-four classes which David had established. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#004">Ch1 24:4</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#004">Jeremiah 19:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">jer 19:4</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Estranged this place - Ye have devoted my temple to a widely different purpose from that for which it was erected. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#005">Jeremiah 19:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">jer 19:5</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Offerings unto Baal - A general name for all the popular idols; Baal, Moloch, Ashtaroth, etc. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#007">Jeremiah 19:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">jer 19:7</a></font></span></p>
 <p>I will make void the counsel of Judah - Probably this refers to some determination made to proclaim themselves independent, and pay no more tribute to the Chaldeans.
 </p><p>To be meat for the fowls - See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#033">Jer 7:33</a> (note). 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#009">Jeremiah 19:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">jer 19:9</a></font></span></p>
 <p>I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons - This was literally fulfilled when Jerusalem was besieged by the Romans. This also the prophet might have had in view. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#011">Jeremiah 19:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">jer 19:11</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Even so will I break this people and this city - The breaking of the bottle was the symbolical representation of the destruction of the city and of the state.
 </p><p>That cannot be made whole again - This seems to refer rather to the final destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, than to what was done by the Chaldeans. Jerusalem was healed after 70 years: but nearly 1800 years have elapsed since Jerusalem was taken and destroyed by the Romans; and it was then so broken, that it could not be made whole again. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#012">Jeremiah 19:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">jer 19:12</a></font></span></p>
 <p>And even make this city as Tophet - A place of slaughter and destruction. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#014">Jeremiah 19:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">jer 19:14</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Then came Jeremiah from Tophet - He had probably gone to the valley of Hinnom, and there repeated the discourse which he had a little before delivered to the chief priests and elders. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#015">Jeremiah 19:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">jer 19:15</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Because they have hardened their necks - A metaphor taken from unruly and unbroken oxen, who resist the yoke, break and run away with their gears. So this people had broken and destroyed the yoke of the law.
