 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Synopsis of the Books of the Bible</i>, by John Nelson Darby, [1857-62], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa100.htm#001">Psalms Chapter 100</a></h3> 
 <p>Psalm 100 is the summons to universal worship of Jehovah with gladness and praise. Jehovah is good. Verse 5 (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa100.htm#005">Psa 100:5</a>) gives in principle the great truth so often laid down as Israel's hope  His mercy endureth for ever  which gave them too to say, How long? "All ye lands" is free as a translation; it is rather "all the land" (of Israel) or "all the earth." The claim of Israel to be His people and the sheep of His pasture seems to extend it to the earth. It is, however, to me very doubtful if it is not simply "all the land of Israel." This closes the remarkable series picturing the coming of Jehovah (Christ) to establish righteousness and judgment in the earth and His throne in Israel.
