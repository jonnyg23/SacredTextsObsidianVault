 <p>The following commentary covers Chapters 22 and 23.
 </p><p>Chapter 22 recapitulates the sin of Jerusalem, of her prophets, her priests, and her princes. The eye of God sought for some one to stand in the gap before Him, and found none. His indignation should consume them. What force the prophecies give to those words of the Lord, "How often would I have gathered thy children, as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!" In chapter 23 Jehovah justifies Himself for judging Jerusalem by the iniquity and unfaithfulness of her walk. Her whoredom with the Gentiles brought her early course to mind. The same conduct shewed the same nature. She has ended as she began, because at heart she was the same. Samaria's lot should be hers. The latter is called a tent or tabernacle, and Jerusalem "My tabernacle in her."
