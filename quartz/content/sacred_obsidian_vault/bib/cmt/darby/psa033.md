 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Synopsis of the Books of the Bible</i>, by John Nelson Darby, [1857-62], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#001">Psalms Chapter 33</a></h3> 
 <p>Psalm 33 has its just place after the forgiveness of the people. Before we pass on to these psalms, remark how the guilelessness of heart produced by complete forgiveness leads to that intimacy with God which gives us to be guided by His eye. We have His mind with Himself, and that in the perfectness of His own nature in which He reveals it. Forgiveness leads to full blessing.
 </p><p>In Psalm 33 the full result of deliverance is celebrated. The upright are called on to rejoice. Jehovah's character, His word and works, are made manifest, and the earth is now full of His goodness. He is the glorious Creator; the earth is to fear Him; all man's devices and counsels come to nothing before Him; His counsel stands. Blessed the nation whose God is Jehovah, the people He has chosen for His inheritance It is Jehovah who has looked down on men and disposed of all; but His eye is on them that fear Him and hope in His mercy Thus the great result of the intervention of Jehovah is brought before the faith of the remnant, chanted as if all were come. The last three Verses (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#020">Psa 33:20-22</a>) show the confidence this produces in them.
