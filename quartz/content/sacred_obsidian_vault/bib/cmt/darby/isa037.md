 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Synopsis of the Books of the Bible</i>, by John Nelson Darby, [1857-62], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#001">Isaiah Chapter 37</a></h3> 
 <p>The following commentary covers Chapters 36, 37, 38, and 39.
 </p><p>Chapters 36-39 relate the history of the invasion of Sennacherib, its result, and the sickness unto death of Hezekiah, which preceded it: an instruction for the remnant as to the manner in which the Lord should be waited on (this deliverance being, as to the substance of it, a figure of that which will take place with respect to the Assyrian in the last days). The sickness of Hezekiah furnishes us with a type of the Son of David as raised from the dead-the power of Christ, which shall be perfected in a nation raised also-morally-from the dead, all their sins being pardoned. It is the outward and inward deliverance of Israel: resurrection (as to its practical power); and deliverance from the Assyrian. Meanwhile, as a present thing, the captivity in Babylon is announced.
 </p><p>Previously to this, we have rather had the outward history of Israel; but now we have their moral or inward history, in their place of testimony against idolatry, and in their relationship with Christ, and the separation of a remnant. See the next note further on.
