 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Synopsis of the Books of the Bible</i>, by John Nelson Darby, [1857-62], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#001">Jeremiah Chapter 13</a></h3> 
 <p>Chapter 13, bringing to mind how God had bound Israel to His heart, announces the terrible judgment with which the people shall, as it were, be drunken; and, on the ground of this judgment, calls them to repentance. He relates their hopeless evil, and the unfeigned grief of the prophet at their obstinacy. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#041">Luk 19:41</a>. This zeal for Jehovah's glory against the evil and the people who dishonoured Him, and touching affection to them as Jehovah's people, is everywhere a striking mark of the working of the Spirit of Christ. Compare Moses (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#027">Exo 32:27-28</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#031">Exo 32:31</a>, and sequel); so Paul (Romans 9; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#015">Th1 2:15-16</a>): only here, under grace, there is no call for judgment; so even Christ Himself (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#031">Mat 23:31-37</a>).
