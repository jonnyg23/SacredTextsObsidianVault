 <p>Psalm 132 is, in some respects, a very interesting psalm. It is the restoration of the ark of the covenant to its resting-place, and the promises of Jehovah, in answer to the supplication of His servant. It is founded on David's bringing the ark up to Zion. This, as we have seen in the historical books, has a very important place. It was grace acting by power when Israel had so completely failed that the bond of the people with God, so far as it was founded on the people's responsibility, was wholly broken, and the ark gone into captivity, and Ichabod written on all. [See Note #1] But now, in a fuller and more lasting sense, a habitation was found for the mighty God of Jacob, where the godly would worship low before His footstool. The fruit of David's body, the Messiah of Jehovah, was to sit on His throne, and that for evermore. Jehovah was entering into His rest  He and the ark of His strength. Before (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#035">Num 10:35-36</a>), if He arose it was to scatter His enemies, and then He returned to the many thousands of Israel. But now, and this is what characterizes the psalm, the enemies were scattered, and Jehovah arose to take His rest in Israel. The sovereign election of God is seen, Verse 13 (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#013">Psa 132:13</a>); and, then, it will be remarked, that the promise, in answer to the supplication, goes each time beyond the request (compare Verses (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#014">Psa 132:14</a>; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#015">Psa 132:15</a>; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#008">Psa 132:8</a>; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#016">Psa 132:16</a>; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#009">Psa 132:9</a>; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#017">Psa 132:17</a>; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#018">Psa 132:18</a>; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#010">Psa 132:10</a>). This is of the highest interest as showing the grace of the Lord, and how His love surpasses all the hopes of His people, His interest in them.
 </p><p>Note #1
 </p><p>The three principles of government had been brought out in Israel. First, direct responsibility to God under priesthood. That had failed under Eli, and that was Ichabod. It was over with Israel on the ground of their own responsibility. Then God intervened by a prophet. That He could still do; it was a sovereign act. But that failed; so did royalty as set up by the people. Then we have royalty as power in grace, as it will be in Christ, and the lost ark brought back. This is what we have in this psalm.
