 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#001">2 Chronicles Chapter 16</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#001">2 Chronicles 16:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">ch2 16:1</a></font></span></p>Of the reign - Or, of the kingdom of Asa, that is, of the kingdom of Judah, which was now Asa's kingdom; or from the time of the division of the two kingdoms. Rehoboam reigned seventeen years, Abijah three years, Asa had now reigned fifteen years, all which put together, make up the thirty five years mentioned <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#019">Ch2 15:19</a>, and in the next year Baasha wars against him; and the ground of the war was the defection of many of his subjects to Asa, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#009">Ch2 15:9</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#007">2 Chronicles 16:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">ch2 16:7</a></font></span></p>Escaped - And so reserved to be a scourge to thy kingdom and posterity: whereas if he had joined with Baasha against thee, thou shouldst have overthrown them both, and prevented all that mischief which that monarch will do to thy family. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#008">2 Chronicles 16:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">ch2 16:8</a></font></span></p>Lubims - Either, the Lybians in Africa; or another people, possibly descended from them, but now seated in some part of Arabia. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#009">2 Chronicles 16:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">ch2 16:9</a></font></span></p>Done foolishly - It is a foolish thing to lean on a broken reed, when we have the rock of ages to rely upon. Perfect - Upright and sincere, as thine is not. He was sincere in the general course of his life, but some particulars, whereof this is one, his heart did not perfectly cleave to God. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#012">2 Chronicles 16:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">ch2 16:12</a></font></span></p>Sought not - He did not humble himself before God, but put his confidence in the skill and faithfulness of his physicians. His making use of physicians was his duty, but his trusting in them, and expecting that from them, which was to be had from God only, was his sin and folly. The help of every creature must be used, with an eye to the creator, and in dependence on him, who makes every creature that to us which it is, without whom the most skilful and faithful are physicians of no value. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#014">2 Chronicles 16:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">ch2 16:14</a></font></span></p>Burning - Of precious spices; thereby testifying their respect to him notwithstanding his miscarriages.
