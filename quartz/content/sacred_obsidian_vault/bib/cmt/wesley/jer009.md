 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">jer 9:2</a></font></span></p>A lodging place - Some retiring place, though it were but some mean hut in the wilderness. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#005">Jeremiah 9:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">jer 9:5</a></font></span></p>Weary - They use industry, and contrivance in it, they spare no labour. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#007">Jeremiah 9:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">jer 9:7</a></font></span></p>Try them - By melting them, I will bring upon them, the fire of the Chaldean war, that shall purge away those deceits in which they trust, that the remnant may be purified. For how - I have tried all other means. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#010">Jeremiah 9:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">jer 9:10</a></font></span></p>Wailing - The prophet having taken up a lamentation for the slaughter of the people, now re - assumes it for the desolation of the whole land. The mountains shall not be able to secure them, nor the valleys to feed them. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#012">Jeremiah 9:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">jer 9:12</a></font></span></p>Who is - Is there not a wise man among you, that will search into the cause of all these threatened judgments. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#016">Jeremiah 9:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">jer 9:16</a></font></span></p>A sword - But I will follow them with the sword, 'till they be destroyed, such of them as were appointed for destruction; for otherwise, they were not all consumed, a full end was not to be made. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#017">Jeremiah 9:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">jer 9:17</a></font></span></p>Women - Who were hired to tear their hair, and beat their breasts, with other mourning postures, a foolish custom which has obtained in most ages and countries. Cunning - Such as are most skilful in it. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#020">Jeremiah 9:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">jer 9:20</a></font></span></p>Every one - It denotes how large and universal the mourning shall be. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#021">Jeremiah 9:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">jer 9:21</a></font></span></p>Death - The unavoidableness of the ruin is expressed metaphorically, alluding to the storming of a city, wherein there is no respect had to sex, youth, or age. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#022">Jeremiah 9:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">jer 9:22</a></font></span></p>As the handful - They shall be no more regarded than a few scattered ears that drop out of the reapers hand, which either lie on the ground and are eaten by birds, or trod to dirt by beasts. None - None shall have so much respect to them, as to afford burial. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#024">Jeremiah 9:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">jer 9:24</a></font></span></p>Knoweth - Whether we make any curious distinction between understanding God, as if that be more speculative, whereby we rightly apprehend his nature; and knowing God, as if that be more practical, as directing the conversation, we need not here enquire; yet certainly both center in this, that we so know and understand God as to trust in him, and depend on him alone in all conditions. Exercise - Kindness, as it relates to his own people; judgment, in punishing the wicked; righteousness, as he deals justly and uprightly with both.
