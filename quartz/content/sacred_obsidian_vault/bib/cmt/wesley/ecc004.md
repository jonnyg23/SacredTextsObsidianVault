 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#001">Ecclesiastes Chapter 4</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#001">Ecclesiastes 4:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">ecc 4:1</a></font></span></p>I returned - I considered again. Oppressions - Whether by princes, magistrates, or other potent persons. No comforter - None afforded them pity or succour. But they, &amp;c. - No comfort therein. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#002">Ecclesiastes 4:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">ecc 4:2</a></font></span></p>I praised - I judged them less miserable. For this is certain, that setting aside the future life, which Solomon doth not meddle with in the present debate; and considering the uncertainty, and vanity, and manifold calamities of the present life, a wise man would not account it worth his while to live. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#003">Ecclesiastes 4:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">ecc 4:3</a></font></span></p>Better is he - Who was never born. Not seen - Not felt: for as seeing good is put for enjoying it, so seeing evil is put for suffering it. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#004">Ecclesiastes 4:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">ecc 4:4</a></font></span></p>Right work - All the worthy designs of virtuous men. Envied - Instead of honour, he meets with envy and obloquy. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#005">Ecclesiastes 4:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">ecc 4:5</a></font></span></p>The fool - Is careless and idle: perceiving that diligence is attended with envy, he runs into the other extreme. Eateth - Wastes his substance, and brings himself to poverty, whereby his very flesh pines away for want of bread. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#006">Ecclesiastes 4:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">ecc 4:6</a></font></span></p>Better - These are the words of the sluggard, making this apology for his idleness, That his little with ease, is better than great riches got with much trouble. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#008">Ecclesiastes 4:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">ecc 4:8</a></font></span></p>Alone - Who has none but himself to care for. Brother - To whom he may leave his vast estate. Yet - He lives in perpetual restlessness and toil. For whom - Having no kindred to enjoy it. And bereave - Deny myself those comforts and conveniences which God hath allowed me? A sore travel - A dreadful judgment, as well as a great sin. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#009">Ecclesiastes 4:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">ecc 4:9</a></font></span></p>Two - Who live together in any kind of society. Because - Both have great benefit by such conjunction, whereby they support, encourage, and strengthen one another. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#010">Ecclesiastes 4:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">ecc 4:10</a></font></span></p>They - One of them. Fall - Into any mistake, or sin, or danger. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#012">Ecclesiastes 4:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">ecc 4:12</a></font></span></p>Prevail - Against either of them. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#013">Ecclesiastes 4:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">ecc 4:13</a></font></span></p>Better - More happy. Now he proceeds to another vanity, That of honour and power. Than a king - Who hath neither wisdom to govern himself, nor to receive the counsels of wiser men. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#014">Ecclesiastes 4:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">ecc 4:14</a></font></span></p>For he - The poor and wise child is often advanced to the highest dignity. Whereas - That old king is deprived of his kingdom. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#015">Ecclesiastes 4:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">ecc 4:15</a></font></span></p>I considered - The general disposition of common people, in all kingdoms, that they are fickle and inconstant. With the second child - This may be understood of the king's child, or son and heir, called second, in respect of his father, whose successor he is. Stand up - Arise to reign. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#016">Ecclesiastes 4:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">ecc 4:16</a></font></span></p>No end - This humour of the common people hath no end, but passes from one generation to another. Before them - Before the present generation. And so here are three generations of people noted, the authors of the present change, and their parents, and their children; and all are observed to have the same inclinations. In him - They shall be as weary of the successor, though a wise and worthy prince, as their parents were of his foolish predecessor.
