 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#001">Numbers Chapter 6</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#002">Numbers 6:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">num 6:2</a></font></span></p>Man or woman - For both sexes might make this vow, if they were free and at their own disposal: otherwise their parents or husbands could disannul the vow. A vow of a Nazarite - Whereby they sequestered themselves from worldly employments and enjoyments, that they might entirely consecrate themselves to God's service, and this either for their whole lifetime, or for a less and limited space of time. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#003">Numbers 6:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">num 6:3</a></font></span></p>Nor eat grapes - Which was forbidden him for greater caution to keep him at the farther distance from wine. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#004">Numbers 6:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">num 6:4</a></font></span></p>All the days of his separation - Which were sometimes more, sometimes fewer, as he thought fit to appoint. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#005">Numbers 6:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">num 6:5</a></font></span></p>No razor - Nor scissors, or other instrument to cut off any part of his hair. This was appointed, partly as a sign of his mortification to worldly delights and outward beauty; partly as a testimony of that purity which hereby he professed, because the cutting off the hair was a sign of uncleanness, as appears from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#009">Num 6:9</a>, partly that by the length of his hair he might be constantly minded of his vow; and partly that he might reserve his hair entirely for God, to whom it was to be offered. Holy - That is, wholly consecrated to God and his service, whereby he shews that inward holiness was the great thing which God required and valued in these, and consequently in other rites and ceremonies. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#007">Numbers 6:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">num 6:7</a></font></span></p>His father - Wherein he was equal to the high - priest, being, in some sort, as eminent a type of Christ, and therefore justly required to prefer the service of God, to which he had so fully given himself, before the expressions of his affections to his dearest and nearest relations. The consecration - That is, the token of his consecration, namely, his long hair. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#009">Numbers 6:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">num 6:9</a></font></span></p>He shall shave his head - Because his whole body, and especially his hair was defiled by such an accident, which he ought to impute either to his own heedlessness, or to God's providence so ordering the matter, possibly for the punishment of his other sins, or for the quickening him to more purity and detestation of all dead works, whereby he would be defiled. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#011">Numbers 6:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">num 6:11</a></font></span></p>A sin - offering - Because such a pollution was, though not his sin, yet the chastisement of his sin. He sinned - That is, contracted a ceremonial uncleanness, which is called sinning, because it was a type of sin, and a violation of a law, tho' through ignorance and inadvertency. Hallow - Begin again to hallow or consecrate it. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#012">Numbers 6:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">num 6:12</a></font></span></p>The days of his separation - As many days as he had before vowed to God. Lost - Heb. fall, to the ground, that is, be void or of none effect. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#014">Numbers 6:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">num 6:14</a></font></span></p>A sin - offering - Whereby he confessed his miscarriages, notwithstanding the strictness of his vow and all the diligence which he could use, and consequently acknowledged his need of the grace of God in Christ Jesus the true Nazarite. For peace - offerings - For thankfulness to God, who had given him grace to make and in some measure to keep such a vow. So he offered all the three sorts of offerings, that he might so far fulfil all righteousness and profess his obligation to observe the will of God in all things. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#015">Numbers 6:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">num 6:15</a></font></span></p>Their meal - offering - Such as generally accompanied the sacrifices. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#018">Numbers 6:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">num 6:18</a></font></span></p>At the door - Publickly, that it might be known that his vow was ended, and therefore he was at liberty as to those things from which he had restrained himself for a season, otherwise some might have been scandalized at his use of his liberty. The fire - Upon which the flesh of the peace - offerings was boiled. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#019">Numbers 6:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">num 6:19</a></font></span></p>The shoulder - The left - shoulder, as it appears from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#020">Num 6:20</a>, where this is joined with the heave - shoulder, which was the right - shoulder, and which was the priests due in all sacrifices, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#032">Lev 7:32</a>, and in this also. But here the other shoulder was added to it, as a special token of thankfulness from the Nazarites for God's singular favours vouchsafed unto them. The hands - That he may give them to the priest, as his peculiar gift. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#020">Numbers 6:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">num 6:20</a></font></span></p>May drink wine - And return to his former manner of living. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#021">Numbers 6:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">num 6:21</a></font></span></p>That his hand shall get - Besides what he shall voluntarily give according to his ability. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#023">Numbers 6:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">num 6:23</a></font></span></p>On this wise - Heb. Thus, or in these words: yet they were not tied to these very words; because after this we have examples of Moses and David and Solomon, blessing the people in other words. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#024">Numbers 6:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">num 6:24</a></font></span></p>Bless thee - Bestow upon you all manner of blessings, temporal and spiritual. Keep thee - That is, continue his blessings to thee, and preserve thee in and to the use of them; keep thee from sin and its bitter effects. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#025">Numbers 6:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">num 6:25</a></font></span></p>Shine upon thee - Alluding to the shining of the sun upon the earth, to enlighten, and warm, and renew the face of it. The Lord love thee, and make thee know that he loves thee. We cannot but be happy, if we have God's love; and we cannot but be easy, if we know that we have it. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#026">Numbers 6:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">num 6:26</a></font></span></p>Lift up his countenance - That is, look upon thee with a chearful and pleasant countenance, as one that is well pleased with thee and thy services. Peace - Peace with God, with thy own conscience, and with all men; all prosperity is comprehended under this word. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#027">Numbers 6:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">num 6:27</a></font></span></p>Put my name - Shall call them by my name, shall recommend them to me as my own people, and bless them and pray unto me for them as such; which is a powerful argument to prevail with God for them.
