 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#001">Joel Chapter 1</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#001">Joel 1:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">joe 1:1</a></font></span></p>Came to Joel - Probably in the latter end of Jeroboam the second's reign over Israel and in the days of Uzziah, over Judah.  
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#002">Joel 1:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">joe 1:2</a></font></span></p>Old men - The oldest among you, who can remember things done many years ago. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#004">Joel 1:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">joe 1:4</a></font></span></p>Palmer - worm - Four sorts of insects, are here mentioned, which succeeded each other, and devoured all that might be a support to the Jews, whence ensued a grievous famine. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#005">Joel 1:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">joe 1:5</a></font></span></p>Is cut off - Suddenly cut off even when you are ready to drink it, and totally cut off by these devouring vermin. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#006">Joel 1:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">joe 1:6</a></font></span></p>A nation - An innumerable multitude of locusts and caterpillars, called a nation here, as Solomon calls the conies and the ant, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#025">Pro 30:25-26</a>, and perhaps a prognostick of a very numerous and mighty nation, that ere long will invade Judah. Strong - Mighty in power, and undaunted in courage, if you refer it to the Assyrian or Babylonians; if to those vermin, they are, though each weak by itself, yet in those multitudes, strong and irresistible. A great lion - Such waste as lions make, these the locusts do, and the Assyrians will make.

Dried up - The drought was so great, that the vines were withered, and all their hopes of new wine cut off. The oil - The olive - trees. Languisheth - This is a plain account of the reason why the priests were called to mourn, and why the meal - offering and drink - offering were cut off. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#011">Joel 1:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">joe 1:11</a></font></span></p>Be ye ashamed - This is a just cause why you should lament and enquire why God is so displeased with you.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">joe 1:16</a></font></span></p>Cut off - Devoured by locusts, or withered with drought. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#017">Joel 1:17</a></p>
