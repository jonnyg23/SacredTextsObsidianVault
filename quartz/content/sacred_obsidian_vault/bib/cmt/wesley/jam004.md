 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#001">James Chapter 4</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#001">James 4:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">jam 4:1</a></font></span></p>From whence come wars and fightings - Quarrels and wars among you, quite opposite to this peace? Is it not from your pleasures - Your desires of earthly pleasures. Which war - Against your souls. In your members - Here is the first seat of the war. Hence proceeds the war of man with man, king with king, nation with nation. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#002">James 4:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">jam 4:2</a></font></span></p>Ye kill - In your heart, for "he that hateth his brother is a murderer." Ye fight and war - That is, furiously strive and contend. Ye ask not - And no marvel; for a man full of evil desire, of envy or hatred, cannot pray. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#003">James 4:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">jam 4:3</a></font></span></p>But if ye do ask, ye receive not, because ye ask amiss - That is, from a wrong motive. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#004">James 4:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">jam 4:4</a></font></span></p>Ye adulterers and adulteresses - Who have broken your faith with God, your rightful spouse. Know ye not that the friendship or love of the world - The desire of the flesh, the desire of the eye, and the pride of life, or courting the favour of worldly men, is enmity against God? Whosoever desireth to be a friend of the world - Whosoever seeks either the happiness or favour of it, does thereby constitute himself an enemy of God; and can he expect to obtain anything of him? 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#005">James 4:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">jam 4:5</a></font></span></p>Do you think that the scripture saith in vain - Without good ground. St. James seems to refer to many, not any one particular scripture. The spirit of love that dwelleth in all believers lusteth against envy - <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#017">Gal 5:17</a>; is directly opposite to all those unloving tempers which necessarily flow from the friendship of the world. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#006">James 4:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">jam 4:6</a></font></span></p>But he giveth greater grace - To all who shun those tempers. Therefore it - The scripture. Saith, God resisteth the proud - And pride is the great root of all unkind affections. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#034">Pro 3:34</a> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#007">James 4:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">jam 4:7</a></font></span></p>Therefore by humbly submitting yourselves to God, resist the devil - The father of pride and envy. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#008">James 4:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">jam 4:8</a></font></span></p>Then draw nigh to God in prayer, and he will draw nigh unto you, will hear you; which that nothing may hinder, cleanse your hands - Cease from doing evil. And purify your hearts - From all spiritual adultery. Be no more double minded, vainly endeavouring to serve both God and mammon. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#009">James 4:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">jam 4:9</a></font></span></p>Be afflicted - For your past unfaithfulness to God. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#011">James 4:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">jam 4:11</a></font></span></p>Speak not evil one of another - This is a grand hinderance of peace. O who is sufficiently aware of it! He that speaketh evil of another does in effect speak evil of the law, which so strongly prohibits it. Thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge - Of it; thou settest thyself above, and as it were condemnest, it. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#012">James 4:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">jam 4:12</a></font></span></p>There is one lawgiver that is able - To execute the sentence he denounces. But who art thou - A poor, weak, dying worm. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#013">James 4:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">jam 4:13</a></font></span></p>Come now, ye that say - As peremptorily as if your life were in your own hands. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#015">James 4:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">jam 4:15</a></font></span></p>Instead of your saying - That is, whereas ye ought to say. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#017">James 4:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">jam 4:17</a></font></span></p>Therefore to him that knoweth to do good and doeth it not - That knows what is right, and does not practise it. To him it is sin - This knowledge does not prevent, but increase, his condemnation.
