 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#003">Esther 2:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">est 2:3</a></font></span></p>Keeper - Of all the women, both virgins and concubines: only the virgins he himself took care of, as requiring more care and caution, and the concubines be committed to Shaashgaz, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#014">Est 2:14</a>, his deputy. Purification - That is, to cleanse them from all impurities, to perfume, and adorn, and every way prepare them for the king: for the legal purification of the Jews he never regarded. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#007">Esther 2:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">est 2:7</a></font></span></p>Esther - Hadassah was her Hebrew name before her marriage; and she was called Esther by the king after it. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#009">Esther 2:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">est 2:9</a></font></span></p>Pleased - Because she was very beautiful, therefore he supposed she would be acceptable to the king; and by the Divine power, which moveth the hearts of men which way he pleaseth. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#010">Esther 2:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">est 2:10</a></font></span></p>Shew it - Lest the knowledge hereof should either make her contemptible, or bring some inconvenience to the whole nation; but there was also an hand of God in causing this to be concealed, for the better accomplishment of that which he designed, though Mordecai was ignorant of it. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#013">Esther 2:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">est 2:13</a></font></span></p>Desired - For ornament, or by way of attendance. And it should be observed, that every one whom the king took to his bed, was his wife of a lower rank, as Hagar was Abraham's, so that it would have been no sin or dishonour to Esther, though she had not been made queen. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#019">Esther 2:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">est 2:19</a></font></span></p>Sat - By office, as one of the king's guards or ministers; being advanced to this place by Esther's favour.
