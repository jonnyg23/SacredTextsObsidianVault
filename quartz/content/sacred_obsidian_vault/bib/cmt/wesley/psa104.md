 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#002">Psalms 104:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">psa 104:2</a></font></span></p>Light - With that first created light, which the psalmist fitly puts in the first place, as being the first of God's visible works. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#003">Psalms 104:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">psa 104:3</a></font></span></p>Waters - In the waters above the heavens, as they are called, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#007">Gen 1:7</a>.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">psa 104:5</a></font></span></p>Who laid - Heb. he hath established the earth upon its own basis, whereby it stands as fast and unmoveable, as if it were built upon the strongest foundations. Forever - As long as the world continues. God has fixt so strange a place for the earth, that being an heavy body, one would think it should fall every moment. And yet which way so ever we would imagine it to stir, it must, contrary to the nature of such a body, fall upwards, and so can have no possible ruin, but by tumbling into heaven. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#006">Psalms 104:6</a></p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">psa 104:8</a></font></span></p>Go up - In that first division of the waters from the earth, part went upwards, and became springs in the mountains, the greatest part went downwards to the channels made for them.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">psa 104:21</a></font></span></p>Roar - They roar when they come within sight of their prey. Seek - Their roaring is a kind of natural prayer to God, for relief. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#025">Psalms 104:25</a></p>

For he speaks not here of the first creation, but of the continued production of living creatures. Created - Other living creatures are produced; the word created being taken in its largest sense for the production of things by second causes. Renewest - And thus by thy wise and wonderful providence thou preservest the succession of living creatures. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#031">Psalms 104:31</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_031">psa 104:31</a></font></span></p>Rejoice - Thus God advances the glory of his wisdom and power and goodness, in upholding the works of his hands from generation to generation, and he takes pleasure in the preservation of his works, as also in his reflection upon these works of his providence.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_032">psa 104:32</a></font></span></p>He looketh - This is a farther illustration of God's powerful providence: as when he affords his favour to creatures, they live and thrive, so on the contrary, one angry look or touch of his upon the hills or earth, makes them tremble and smoke, as Sinai did when God appeared in it. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#035">Psalms 104:35</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_035">psa 104:35</a></font></span></p>Praise ye the Lord - Heb. Hallelujah. This is the first time that this word occurs.
