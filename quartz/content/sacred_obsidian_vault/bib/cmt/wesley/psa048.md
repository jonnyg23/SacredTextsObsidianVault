 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#001">Psalms 48:1</a></p>

 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#002">Psalms 48:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">psa 48:2</a></font></span></p>The joy - This is spoken prophetically, because the joyful doctrine of the gospel was to go from thence to all nations. The city - Of God, who justly calls himself a great king. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#003">Psalms 48:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">psa 48:3</a></font></span></p>Known - By long experience. Palaces - Possibly he may point at the king's palace and the temple, which was the palace of the king of heaven; which two palaces God did in a singular manner protect, and by protecting them, protected the whole city and people. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#004">Psalms 48:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">psa 48:4</a></font></span></p>The kings - Either those kings confederate against Jehoshaphat, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#001">Ch2 20:1</a>, or the Assyrian princes; whom they vain - gloriously called kings, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#008">Isa 10:8</a>. Passed - In their march towards Jerusalem. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#005">Psalms 48:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">psa 48:5</a></font></span></p>Saw it - They did only look upon it, but not come into it, nor shoot an arrow there - nor cast a bank against it, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#032">Kg2 19:32</a>. Marvelled - At the wonderful works wrought by God. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#006">Psalms 48:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">psa 48:6</a></font></span></p>Fear - At the tidings of Tirhakah's coming against them, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#009">Kg2 19:9</a>, and at that terrible slaughter of their army, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#035">Kg2 19:35</a>.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">psa 48:7</a></font></span></p>Breakest - Thou didst no less violently and suddenly destroy these raging enemies of Jerusalem, than sometimes thou destroyest the ships at sea with a fierce and vehement wind, such as the eastern winds were in those parts.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">psa 48:8</a></font></span></p>Heard - The predictions of the prophets have been verified by the events. Establish - God will defend her in all succeeding ages. And so God would have done, if Jerusalem had not forsaken him, and forfeited his protection. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#009">Psalms 48:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">psa 48:9</a></font></span></p>Thought - It hath been the matter of our serious and deep meditation, when we have been worshipping in thy temple.
