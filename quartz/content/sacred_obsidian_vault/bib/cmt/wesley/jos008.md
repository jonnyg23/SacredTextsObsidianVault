 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#001">Joshua Chapter 8</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#001">Joshua 8:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">jos 8:1</a></font></span></p>Take all the people - That all of them might be partakers of this first spoil, and thereby encouraged to proceed in their work. The weak multitude indeed were not to go, because they might have hindered them in the following stratagem; and it was but fit that the military men who run the greatest hazards, should have the precedency in the spoils. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#002">Joshua 8:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">jos 8:2</a></font></span></p>To Ai - That is, the city and people of Ai. Unto Jericho and her king - That is, overcome and destroy them. This was enjoined to chastise their last insolence, and the triumphs and blasphemies which doubtless their success had produced: and to revive the dread and terror which had been impressed upon the Canaanites by Jericho's ruin, and had been much abated by the late success of Ai. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#003">Joshua 8:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">jos 8:3</a></font></span></p>To go up against Ai - That is, to consider about this expedition; not as if all the people of war did actually go up, which was both unnecessary and burdensome: but it seems to be resolved by Joshua and all the council of war, that the thirty thousand here following should be selected for the enterprize. Either,
 <p>
 </p><p>1, the thirty thousand now mentioned; or, 2. part of them; namely, such as were to lie in wait; and these were
 </p><p>
 </p><p>only five thousand men, as is expressed, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#012">Jos 8:12</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#004">Joshua 8:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">jos 8:4</a></font></span></p>Them - The same party last spoken of, even the five thousand mentioned <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#012">Jos 8:12</a>, there are only two parties engaged in the taking of Ai, and but one ambush, as plainly appears by comparing <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#009">Jos 8:9</a>, with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#012">Jos 8:12</a>, which speaks only of five thousand, who are justly supposed to be a part of those thirty thousand named, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#003">Jos 8:3</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#005">Joshua 8:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">jos 8:5</a></font></span></p>That are - Or, that shall be: for at present he sent them away, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#009">Jos 8:9</a>, but the next morning followed, and joined himself with them, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#010">Jos 8:10-11</a>. That we - I and the twenty five thousand with me. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#009">Joshua 8:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">jos 8:9</a></font></span></p>Sent them - The same party. Among the people - Heb. that people, the people of war as they are called, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#011">Jos 8:11</a>, that is, the main body of the host consisting of thirty thousand. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#010">Joshua 8:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">jos 8:10</a></font></span></p>The people - Heb. that people, not all the people of Israel; which was needless, and required more time than could now be spared; but the rest of that host of thirty thousand, whereof five thousand were sent away; the remainder are numbered, to see whether some of them had not withdrawn themselves, taking the advantage of the night, and of the design of laying an ambush; and that it might be evident, this work was done without any loss of men, whereby they might be encouraged to trust in God, and to proceed resolutely in their work. The elders of Israel - The chief magistrates and rulers of Israel under Joshua; and these, I suppose, went with Joshua, and with the army, to take care that the cattle and the spoil of the city, which was given by God to all Israel for a prey, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#002">Jos 8:2</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#027">Jos 8:27</a>, might be justly and equally divided between those that went to battle, and the rest of the people. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#011">Joshua 8:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">jos 8:11</a></font></span></p>That were with him - Namely, the thirty thousand mentioned, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#003">Jos 8:3</a>, or the most of them. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#012">Joshua 8:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">jos 8:12</a></font></span></p>And he took - Or rather, but he had taken, namely, out of the said number of thirty thousand, for this is added by way of recapitulation and farther explication of what is said in general, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#009">Jos 8:9</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#013">Joshua 8:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">jos 8:13</a></font></span></p>Joshua went - Namely, accompanied with a small part of the host now mentioned, that is, very early in the morning, when it was yet dark, as is said in a like case, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#001">Joh 20:1</a>, whence it is here called night, though it was early in the morning, as is said, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#010">Jos 8:10</a>, for it seems most probable, that all was done in one night's space, and in this manner; Joshua sends away the ambush by night, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#003">Jos 8:3</a>, and lodgeth that night with twenty - five thousand men, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#009">Jos 8:9</a>, not far from the city. But not able or willing to sleep all night, he rises very early, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#010">Jos 8:10</a>, and numbers his men, which by the help of the several officers was quietly done, and so immediately leads them towards Ai; and while it was yet duskish or night, he goes into the midst of the valley, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#013">Jos 8:13</a>, and when the day dawns he is discovered by the king and people of Ai, who thereupon rose up early to fight with them, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#014">Jos 8:14</a>. The valley - Which was near the city, thereby to allure them forth. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#014">Joshua 8:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">jos 8:14</a></font></span></p>His people - Namely, all his men of war, for the rest were left in Ai, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#016">Jos 8:16</a>. At a time appointed - At a certain hour agreed upon between the king and people of Ai, and of Bethel too, who were their confederates in this enterprize, as it may seem from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#017">Jos 8:17</a>. Possibly they might appoint the same hour of the day on which they had fought against Israel with good success, looking upon it as a lucky hour. Before the plain - That is, towards or in sight of that plain or valley in which the Israelites were, that so they might put themselves in battle - array. Against him - The former success having made him secure, as is usual in such cases; God also blinding his mind, and infatuating him, as he useth to do with those whom he intends to destroy. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#015">Joshua 8:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">jos 8:15</a></font></span></p>Made as if they were beaten - That is, fled from them, as it were for fear of a second blow. The wilderness - Which lay between Ai and Jericho, whither they now seemed to flee. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#016">Joshua 8:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">jos 8:16</a></font></span></p>All the people - Namely, all that were able to bear arms, for old men and children were unfit for the pursuit or fight; and that they were yet left, may seem from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#024">Jos 8:24-25</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#017">Joshua 8:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">jos 8:17</a></font></span></p>Not a man - Namely, fit for war. Bethel - Which, being a neighbouring city, and encouraged by the former success, had sent some forces to assist them; and now, upon notice sent to them of the flight of their common enemies, or upon some other signal given, all their men of war join with those of Ai in the pursuit. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#018">Joshua 8:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">jos 8:18</a></font></span></p>Stretch out the spear - This was, either, for a sign to his host present with him, to stop their flight, and make head against the pursuers: or, for a signal to the liers in wait, or, as a token of God's presence and assistance with them, and of their victory. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#019">Joshua 8:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">jos 8:19</a></font></span></p>Set the city on fire - Not all of it, as appears from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#028">Jos 8:28</a>, and because then they had lost that prey which God had allowed them; but part of it, enough to raise a smoke, and give notice to their brethren of their success. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#021">Joshua 8:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">jos 8:21</a></font></span></p>All Israel - That is, all the Israelites there present. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#022">Joshua 8:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">jos 8:22</a></font></span></p>The other - They who lay in ambush. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#023">Joshua 8:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">jos 8:23</a></font></span></p>Took alive - Reserving him to a more ignominious punishment. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#024">Joshua 8:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">jos 8:24</a></font></span></p>Smote it - That is, the inhabitants of it, the men, who through age or infirmity were unfit for war, and the women, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#025">Jos 8:25</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#025">Joshua 8:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">jos 8:25</a></font></span></p>Of Ai - Not strictly, but largely so called, who were now in Ai, either as constant and settled inhabitants, or as sojourners and such as came to them for their help. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#026">Joshua 8:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">jos 8:26</a></font></span></p>Drew not his hand back - He kept his hand and spear in the same posture, both stretched out and lifted up, as a sign both to encourage them, and to direct them to go on in the work. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#029">Joshua 8:29</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">jos 8:29</a></font></span></p>Hanged on a tree - He dealt more severely with the kings of Canaan than with the people, because the abominable wickedness of that people was not restrained and punished (as it should have been) but countenanced and encouraged by their evil examples; and because they were the principal authors of the destruction of their own people, by engaging them in an obstinate opposition against the Israelites. Down from the tree - According to God's command in that case, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#022">Deu 21:22</a>. The gate of the city - Which place he chose either as most commodious, now especially when all the city within the gate was already turned in to an heap of stones and rubbish; or because this was the usual place of judgment; and therefore proper to bear the monument of God's just sentence against him, not without reflection upon that injustice which he had been guilty of in that place. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#030">Joshua 8:30</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_030">jos 8:30</a></font></span></p>Then - Namely, after the taking of Ai. For they were obliged to do this, when they were brought over Jordan into the land of Canaan, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#029">Deu 11:29</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#002">Deu 27:2-3</a>, which is not to be understood strictly, as if it were to be done the same day; for it is manifest they were first to be circumcised, and to eat the passover, which they did, and which was the work of some days; but as soon as they had opportunity to do it, which was now when these two great frontier cities were taken and destroyed, and thereby the coast cleared, and the bordering people under great consternation, so that all the Israelites might securely march thither. And indeed this work was fit to be done as soon as might be, that thereby they might renew their covenant with God, by whose help alone they could expect success in their great and difficult enterprize. Built an altar - Namely, for the offering of sacrifices, as appears from the following verse. Mount Ebal - God's altar was to be but in one place, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#013">Deu 12:13-14</a>, and this place was appointed to he mount Ebal, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#004">Deu 27:4-5</a>, which also seems most proper, that in that place whence the curses of the law were denounced against sinners, there might also be the tokens and means of grace, and peace, and reconciliation with God, for the removing of the curses, and the procuring of God's blessing to sinners. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#032">Joshua 8:32</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_032">jos 8:32</a></font></span></p>Upon the stones - Not upon the stones of the altar, which were to be rough and unpolished, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#031">Jos 8:31</a>, but upon other stones, smooth and plaistered, as is manifest from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#002">Deu 27:2</a>. The law of Moses - Not certainly the whole five books of Moses, for what stones and time would have sufficed for this, but the most weighty parts of the law, and especially the law of the ten commandments. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#033">Joshua 8:33</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_033">jos 8:33</a></font></span></p>All Israel - That is, the whole congregation, old and young, male and female. That side - Some on one side of it, and some on the other. Mount Gerizim - These two places were in the tribe of Ephraim, not far from Shechem, as appears both from scripture, and from other authors. Bless - Or curse, which is easily understood out of the following verse. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#034">Joshua 8:34</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_034">jos 8:34</a></font></span></p>Afterward - After the altar was built, and the stones plaistered and writ upon. He read - That is, he commanded the priests or Levites to read, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#014">Deu 27:14</a>. Blessings and cursings - Which words came in not by way of explication, as if the words of the law were nothing else besides the blessings and curses; but by way of addition, to note that these were read over and above the words of the law. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#035">Joshua 8:35</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_035">jos 8:35</a></font></span></p>Read not - Therefore he read not the blessings and curses only, as some think, but the whole law, as the manner was when all Israel, men and women, were assembled together, or the ten commandments. Among them - Who were proselytes, for no others can be supposed to be with them at this time.
