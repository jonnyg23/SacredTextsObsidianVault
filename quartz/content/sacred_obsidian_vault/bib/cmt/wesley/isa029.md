 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">isa 29:4</a></font></span></p>And thou - Thou who now speakest so loftily, shall be humbled, and with a low voice, beg the favour of thine enemies. As one - Who, that they might possess the people with a kind of reverence and horror, used to deliver their answers with a low voice, from some cave under the ground.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">isa 29:5</a></font></span></p>Strangers - Whom thou hast hired to assist thee, as indeed they did, when the Chaldeans came against them. Terrible ones - Thy great commanders, and stout soldiers. It - This destruction of thy strangers, and terrible ones shall come to pass.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">isa 29:9</a></font></span></p>Wonder - At the stupidity of this people. Cry - Cry out again and again through astonishment. They stagger - With giddiness or stupidity, which makes them like drunken men, insensible of their danger.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">isa 29:13</a></font></span></p>Draw near - Namely, in acts of worship. With lips - With outward devotions. But - They do not pay me that love, and fear, and obedience, which I require. And - They worship me not in such a manner, as I have prescribed, but according to mens inventions, preferring the devices and traditions of their false prophets, before my institutions.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">isa 29:21</a></font></span></p>That make a man - That condemn a man, as if he was a great criminal. For him - For God's faithful prophets and ministers. The gate - There the people used to assemble, both upon civil and sacred accounts, and there prophets used to deliver their prophecies. Turn - From his right. The just - The faithful ministers of God. Nought - Not for any great advantage, but for a trifle. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#022">Isaiah 29:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">isa 29:22</a></font></span></p>Redeemed - From manifold dangers, and especially from idolatry.

The work - The children, not of the flesh, but of the promise, whom I, by my almighty grace, have regenerated. In the midst - Incorporated with the Jews, into one and the same body. Shall sanctify - They shall glorify God, with them and for them. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#024">Isaiah 29:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">isa 29:24</a></font></span></p>That erred - Those Gentiles who erred from God's truth. Murmured - They that murmured at God's faithful teachers, shall now receive God's truth in the love of it.
