 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#001">1 Corinthians Chapter 5</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#001">1 Corinthians 5:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">co1 5:1</a></font></span></p>Fornication - The original word implies criminal conversation of any kind whatever. His father's wife - While his father was alive. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#002">1 Corinthians 5:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">co1 5:2</a></font></span></p>Are ye puffed up? Should ye not rather have mourned - Have solemnly humbled yourselves, and at that time of solemn mourning have expelled that notorious sinner from your communion? 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#003">1 Corinthians 5:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">co1 5:3</a></font></span></p>I verily, as present in spirit - Having a full (it seems, a miraculous) view of the whole fact. Have already, as if I were actually present, judged him who hath so scandalously done this. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#004">1 Corinthians 5:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">co1 5:4</a></font></span></p>And my spirit - Present with you. With the power of the Lord Jesus Christ - To confirm my sentence. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#005">1 Corinthians 5:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">co1 5:5</a></font></span></p>To deliver such an one - This was the highest degree of punishment in the Christian church; and we may observe, the passing this sentence was the act of the apostle, not of the Corinthians. To Satan - Who was usually permitted, in such cases, to inflict pain or sickness on the offender. For the destruction - Though slowly and gradually. Of the flesh - Unless prevented by speedy repentance. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#006">1 Corinthians 5:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">co1 5:6</a></font></span></p>Your glorying - Either in your gifts or prosperity, at such a time as this, is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven - One sin, or one sinner. Leaveneth the whole lump - Diffuses guilt and infection through the whole congregation. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#007">1 Corinthians 5:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">co1 5:7</a></font></span></p>Purge out therefore the old leaven - Both of sinners and of sin. That ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened - That is, that being unleavened ye may be a new lump, holy unto the Lord. For our passover is slain for us - The Jewish passover, about the time of which this epistle was wrote, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#011">Co1 5:11</a>, was only a type of this. What exquisite skill both here and everywhere conducts the zeal of the inspired writer! How surprising a transition is here, and yet how perfectly natural! The apostle, speaking of the incestuous criminal, slides into his darling topic, - crucified Saviour. Who would have expected it on such an occasion. Yet, when it is thus brought in, who does not see and admire both the propriety of the subject, and the delicacy of its introduction? 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#008">1 Corinthians 5:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">co1 5:8</a></font></span></p>Therefore let us keep the feast - Let us feed on him by faith. Here is a plain allusion to the Lord's supper, which was instituted in the room of the passover. Not with the old leaven - Of heathenism or Judaism. Malignity is stubbornness in evil. Sincerity and truth seem to be put here for the whole of true, inward religion. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#009">1 Corinthians 5:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">co1 5:9</a></font></span></p>I wrote to you in a former epistle - And, doubtless, both St. Paul and the other apostles wrote many things which are not extant now. Not to converse - Familiarly; not to contract any intimacy or acquaintance with them, more than is absolutely necessary. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#010">1 Corinthians 5:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">co1 5:10</a></font></span></p>But I did not mean that you should altogether refrain from conversing with heathens, though they are guilty in some of these respects. Covetous, rapacious, idolaters - Sinners against themselves, their neighbour, God. For then ye must go out of the world - Then all civil commerce must cease. So that going out of the world, which some account a perfection, St. Paul accounts an utter absurdity. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#011">1 Corinthians 5:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">co1 5:11</a></font></span></p>Who is named a brother - That is, a Christian; especially if a member of the same congregation. Rapacious - Guilty of oppression, extortion, or any open injustice. No, not to eat with him - Which is the lowest degree of familiarity. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#012">1 Corinthians 5:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">co1 5:12</a></font></span></p>I speak of Christians only. For what have I to do to judge heathens? But ye, as well as I, judge those of your own community. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#013">1 Corinthians 5:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">co1 5:13</a></font></span></p>Them that are without God will judge - The passing sentence on these he hath reserved to himself. And ye will take away that wicked person - This properly belongs to you.
