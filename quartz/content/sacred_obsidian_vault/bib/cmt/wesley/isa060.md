 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#001">Isaiah 60:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">isa 60:1</a></font></span></p>Arise - A word of encouragement accommodated to the Jewish, or Hebrew style, wherein, as by lying down, is described a servile and calamitous condition, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#001">Isa 47:1</a>, so by rising, and standing up, a recovery out of it, into a free, and prosperous one, as may be seen frequently; Rouze up, intimating her deliverance to be at hand. Here under a type, of Jerusalem's restoration, is displayed the flourishing state of the Gentile - church, under the Messiah. Thy light - Thy flourishing and prosperous state. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#002">Isaiah 60:2</a></p>

Shall be seen - Shall be conspicuous; as the Lord's arising, to the darkness covering the earth, so the glory being seen, answers to that gross darkness.
