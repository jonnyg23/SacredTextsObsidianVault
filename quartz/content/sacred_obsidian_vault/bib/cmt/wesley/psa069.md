 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#001">Psalms 69:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">psa 69:1</a></font></span></p>Waters - Tribulations. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#004">Psalms 69:4</a></p>

 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#007">Psalms 69:7</a></p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">psa 69:9</a></font></span></p>Zeal - That fervent love which I have for thy house and service, and glory, and people. Eaten - Exhausted my spirits. Upon me - I have been as deeply affected with thy reproaches, as with mine own. This tho' truly belonging to David, yet was also directed by the spirit of God in him, to represent the disposition and condition of Christ, in whom it was more fully accomplished, to whom therefore it is applied in the New Testament, the first part of it, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#017">Joh 2:17</a>, and the latter, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#003">Rom 15:3</a>.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">psa 69:21</a></font></span></p>Gall - Instead of giving me that comfort which my condition required, they added to my afflictions.

A snare - Their table or meat, which is set before them, shall become a snare: the occasion of their destruction. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#023">Psalms 69:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">psa 69:23</a></font></span></p>Eyes - Not the eyes of their bodies, but of their minds: as they that shut their eyes and will not see, so they shall be judicially blinded. To shake - To take away their strength.

 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#031">Psalms 69:31</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_031">psa 69:31</a></font></span></p>This - This hearty sacrifice of praise, is more grateful to God, than the most glorious legal sacrifices.

 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#032">Psalms 69:32</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_032">psa 69:32</a></font></span></p>The humble - Those pious persons who are grieved for their calamities, will heartily rejoice in my deliverance. Live - Or, be revived, which were dejected, and in a manner dead with sorrow.
