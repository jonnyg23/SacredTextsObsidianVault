 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">eze 36:21</a></font></span></p>But I had pity - For these sins I had just cause to cut them off; but I had pity, for the glory of my name: had I destroyed them, the heathen would have concluded against my omnipotence, and my truth.

A heart in which the law of God is written, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#033">Jer 31:33</a>. A sanctified heart, in which the almighty grace of God is victorious, and turns it from all sin to God. A new spirit - A new, holy frame in the spirit of man; which is given to him, not wrought by his own power. The stony - The senseless unfeeling. Out of your flesh - Out of you. Of flesh - That is, quite of another temper, hearkening to God's law, trembling at his threats, moulded into a compliance with his whole will; to forbear, do, be, or suffer what God will, receiving the impress of God, as soft wax receives the impress of the seal. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#027">Ezekiel 36:27</a></p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_028">eze 36:28</a></font></span></p>Ye shall dwell - Observe: then, and not before, are these promises to be fulfilled to the house of Israel. And I will be your God - This is the foundation of the top - stone of a believer's happiness. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#029">Ezekiel 36:29</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">eze 36:29</a></font></span></p>I will also save you - I will continue to save you. From all your uncleannesses - Salvation from all uncleannessess, includes justification, entire sanctification, and meetness for glory. The corn - All necessaries comprised in one. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#035">Ezekiel 36:35</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_035">eze 36:35</a></font></span></p>And they - Strangers, or foreigners.

 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#038">Ezekiel 36:38</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_038">eze 36:38</a></font></span></p>As the holy flock - Flocks designed to holy uses. In her solemn feasts - These flocks were for quality, the best of all; and for numbers, very great, on the solemn feasts. Thus shall men multiply, and fill the cities of replanted Judea. And the increase of the numbers of men is then honourable, when they are all dedicated to God as a holy flock, to be presented to him for living sacrifices. Crowds are a lovely sight in God's temple.
