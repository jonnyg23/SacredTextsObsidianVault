 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#001">Isaiah 51:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">isa 51:1</a></font></span></p>Look - Consider the state of Abraham and Sarah, from whom all of you sprang.

Increased - Into a vast multitude, when his condition was desperate in the eye of reason. And therefore God can as easily raise his church when they are in the most forlorn condition.

A law - A new law, even the doctrine of the gospel. Judgment - Judgment is here the same thing with law, the word of God, or the evangelical doctrine, of which he saith that he will make it to rest, that is settle and establish it. The people - People of all nations.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">isa 51:5</a></font></span></p>My righteousness - My salvation, the redemption of all my people, Jews and Gentiles, which is the effect of his righteousness, his justice, faithfulness, or mercy. Is gone - Shall shortly go forth. Judge - Shall subdue the Gentiles to my authority, and rule them by my word and spirit. Isles - The remote countries shall expect this salvation from me, and from me only.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">isa 51:16</a></font></span></p>I have - These words are spoken by God to his church and people, to whom he speaks both in the foregoing and following verses. For God's word is frequently said to be put into the mouths, not only of the prophets, but of the people also. Covered - Have protected thee by my almighty power, that I may bring thee to that perfect and blessed estate which is reserved for the days of the Messiah, which in scripture phrase is called a making of new heavens, and a new earth, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#017">Isa 65:17</a>.

 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#020">Isaiah 51:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">isa 51:20</a></font></span></p>Fainted - They are so far from being able to comfort thee, that they themselves faint away. They lie - Dead by famine or the sword. As a bull - Those of them who are not slain are struggling for life. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#021">Isaiah 51:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">isa 51:21</a></font></span></p>Not with wine - But with the cup of God's fury.
