 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">job 27:1</a></font></span></p>Parable - His grave and weighty discourse. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#002">Job 27:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">job 27:2</a></font></span></p>Who - Though he knows my integrity, yet doth not plead my cause against my friends.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">job 27:7</a></font></span></p>Let - I am so far from practicing wickedness, that I abhor the thoughts of it, and if I would wish to be revenged of my enemy, I could wish him no greater mischief than to be a wicked man.
