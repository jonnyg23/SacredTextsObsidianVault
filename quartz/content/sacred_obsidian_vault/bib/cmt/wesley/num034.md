 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#001">Numbers Chapter 34</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#002">Numbers 34:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">num 34:2</a></font></span></p>Coasts - Or limits or bounds, to wit, of the land beyond Jordan. Which are here particularly described, to direct and bound them in their wars and conquests, that they might not seek the enlargement of their empire, after the manner of other nations, but be contented with their own portion. To encourage them in their attempt upon Canaan, and assure them of their success. There was a much larger possession promised them, if they were obedient, even to the river Euphrates. But this, which is properly Canaan, lay in a very little compass. 'Tis but about an hundred and fifty miles in length, and about fifty in breadth. This was that little spot of ground, in which alone for many ages God was known! But its littleness was abundantly compensated by its fruitfulness: otherwise it could not have sustained so numerous a nation. See, how little a share of the world God often gives to his own people! But they that have their portion in heaven, can be content with a small pittance of this earth. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#003">Numbers 34:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">num 34:3</a></font></span></p>Your fourth quarter - Which is here described from east to west by divers windings and turnings, by reason of the mountains and rivers. The salt sea - So called from the salt and sulphurous taste of its waters. Eastward - That is, at the eastern part of that sea, where the eastern and southern borders meet. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#004">Numbers 34:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">num 34:4</a></font></span></p>From the south - Or, on the south, that is, proceeding onward towards the south. Azmon - Which is at the west - end of the mount of Edom. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#005">Numbers 34:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">num 34:5</a></font></span></p>The river of Egypt - Called Sihor, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#003">Jos 13:3</a>, which divided Egypt from Canaan. The sea - The midland sea, called the sea emphatically, whereas the other seas, as they are called, are indeed but lakes. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#006">Numbers 34:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">num 34:6</a></font></span></p>The great sea - This midland sea from the south to the north, so far as it runs parallel with mount Libanus. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#007">Numbers 34:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">num 34:7</a></font></span></p>Hor - Not that Hor where Aaron died, which was southward, and bordering upon Edom, but another mountain, and, as it is conceived, the mountain of Libanus, which is elsewhere mentioned as the northern border of the land, and which, in regard of divers parts, or by divers people, is called by divers names, and here Hor, which signifies a mountain, by way of eminency. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#017">Numbers 34:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">num 34:17</a></font></span></p>Eleazar - Who was to act in God's name, to cast lots, to prevent contentions, to consult with God in cases of difficulty, to transact the whole business in a solemn and religious manner. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#019">Numbers 34:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">num 34:19</a></font></span></p>Judah - The order of the tribes is here different from that, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#007">Num 1:7</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#026">Num 1:26</a>, and in other places, being conformed to the order of their several inheritances, which afterwards fell to them by lots. Which is an evident demonstration of the infinite wisdom of God's providence, and of his peculiar care over his people.
