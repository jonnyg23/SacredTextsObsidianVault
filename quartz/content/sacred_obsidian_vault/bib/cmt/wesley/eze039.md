 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#001">Ezekiel Chapter 39</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#002">Ezekiel 39:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">eze 39:2</a></font></span></p>The sixth part - I will leave in thy country but one in six. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#003">Ezekiel 39:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">eze 39:3</a></font></span></p>Thy bow - What is said of the bow rendered useless, is to be understood of all other weapons of war; this is one kind, the bow, being most in use with the Scythians, is mentioned for all the rest. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#008">Ezekiel 39:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">eze 39:8</a></font></span></p>It is come - As sure as if already come. The day - That notable day of recompences against the last great enemies of the church. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#009">Ezekiel 39:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">eze 39:9</a></font></span></p>The weapons - The warlike provision, instruments, engines, carriages and wagons. Shall burn - It may be wondered why they burn these weapons, which might be of use to them for defence; but it was done in testimony that God was their defence, on whom only they relied. With fire - In such a country where the need of fire is much less than with us, it will not seem incredible, that the warlike utensils of so numerous an army might be enough to furnish them with fuel for many years. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#011">Ezekiel 39:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">eze 39:11</a></font></span></p>Gog - And to many of those with him; but many were given to the birds and beasts to be devoured. Graves - Gog came to take possession; and so he shall, but not as he purposed and hoped. He shall possess his house of darkness in that land which he invaded. The valley of the passengers - So called from the frequent travels of passengers through it from Egypt and Arabia Felix, into the more northern parts, and from these again into Egypt and Arabia. The sea - The Dead Sea. Hamon Gog - That is, the multitude of Gog. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#013">Ezekiel 39:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">eze 39:13</a></font></span></p>Glorified - The day of my being glorified shall be a renown to Israel. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#014">Ezekiel 39:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">eze 39:14</a></font></span></p>They - The rulers of Israel. Sever - Chuse out men who shall make it their work. Passing - To go up and down over the whole land; for many of Gog's wounded, flying soldiers, died in thickets, and corners into which they crept. The passengers - Whose assistance they would desire of courtesy. Remain - Unburied by the public labour of the house of Israel during the seven months. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#016">Ezekiel 39:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">eze 39:16</a></font></span></p>The city - That is, the multitude: the city which is next to this common tomb of Gog. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#017">Ezekiel 39:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">eze 39:17</a></font></span></p>I do sacrifice - The punishment of these God calls a sacrifice, which he offers to his own justice. Upon the mountains - Where more thousands are offered at once, than ever were at any time offered; 'tis a sacrifice so great, that none ever was, or will be like it. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#018">Ezekiel 39:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">eze 39:18</a></font></span></p>Ye shall eat - In these two and the following verses, God takes on him the person of one that makes a feast, invites his guests, and promises to satisfy them. Of the two former, the first is an Enigmatical invitation, or an invitation in a riddle; the latter is the key to this character. The mighty - Who had great authority, great courage and strength, the giant - like ones, commanders of great note in the army. Princes - Many princes came with their country men and subjects to assist in this war. Rams - These are compared to rams which lead the flock. Lambs - Lambs are the more ordinary in the army. Goats - Goats signify the more lascivious, and impetuous among them. Bullocks - Bullocks, such as though more slow, were of great strength. Fatlings - Well fed. Bashan - A mountain of most rich, and sweet soil. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#020">Ezekiel 39:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">eze 39:20</a></font></span></p>At my table - In the field where Gog, his princes, and army, are slain, compared to a table. Horses - Horsemen, not common foot soldiers. Chariots - The men that ride in them. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#021">Ezekiel 39:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">eze 39:21</a></font></span></p>All the heathen - In the countries to which the news shall come. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#026">Ezekiel 39:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">eze 39:26</a></font></span></p>Their shame - Reproach for their sins.
