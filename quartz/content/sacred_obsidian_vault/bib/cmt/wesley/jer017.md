 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#001">Jeremiah 17:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">jer 17:1</a></font></span></p>Graven - Nor is it a thing done in secret, but it is engraven upon the horns of their altars. God's altar was four - square, and at each corner there was a rising part made of brass, these were called the horns of the altar. Now their sin is said to be engraven upon the horns of the altar, because the blood of the sacrifices which they offered to idols was sprinkled there, or because their altars had some inscription upon them, declaring to what idol that altar was consecrated. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#002">Jeremiah 17:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">jer 17:2</a></font></span></p>Their children - This shewed how inveterate they were in this sin of idolatry, that they taught it their children.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">jer 17:3</a></font></span></p>My mountain - Jerusalem stood at the foot of an hill, and part of it on the side of it, upon the top of which hills, were many pleasant fields. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#004">Jeremiah 17:4</a></p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">jer 17:9</a></font></span></p>The heart - There is nothing so false and deceitful as the heart of man; deceitful in its apprehensions of things, in the hopes and promises which it nourishes, in the assurances that it gives us; unsearchable by others, deceitful with reference to ourselves, and abominably wicked, so that neither can a man know his own heart, nor can any other know that of his neighbour's.
