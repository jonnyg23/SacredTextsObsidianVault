 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#001">Ephesians Chapter 4</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#001">Ephesians 4:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">eph 4:1</a></font></span></p>I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord - Imprisoned for his sake and for your sakes; for the sake of the gospel which he had preached amongst them. This was therefore a powerful motive to them to comfort him under it by their obedience. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#003">Ephesians 4:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">eph 4:3</a></font></span></p>Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit - That mutual union and harmony, which is a fruit of the Spirit. The bond of peace is love. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#004">Ephesians 4:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">eph 4:4</a></font></span></p>There is one body - The universal church, all believers throughout the world. One Spirit, one Lord, one God and Father - The ever - blessed Trinity. One hope - Of heaven. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#005">Ephesians 4:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">eph 4:5</a></font></span></p>One outward baptism. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#006">Ephesians 4:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">eph 4:6</a></font></span></p>One God and Father of all - That believe. Who is above all - Presiding over all his children, operating through them all by Christ, and dwelling in all by his Spirit. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#007">Ephesians 4:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">eph 4:7</a></font></span></p>According to the measure of the gift of Christ - According as Christ is pleased to give to each. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#008">Ephesians 4:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">eph 4:8</a></font></span></p>Wherefore he saith - That is, in reference to which God saith by David, Having ascended on high, he led captivity captive - He triumphed over all his enemies, Satan, sin, and death, which had before enslaved all the world: alluding to the custom of ancient conquerors, who led those they had conquered in chains after them. And, as they also used to give donatives to the people, at their return from victory, so he gave gifts to men - Both the ordinary and extraordinary gifts of the Spirit. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#018">Psa 68:18</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#009">Ephesians 4:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">eph 4:9</a></font></span></p>Now this expression, He ascended, what is it, but that he descended - That is, does it not imply, that he descended first? Certainly it does, on the supposition of his being God. Otherwise it would not: since all the saints will ascend to heaven, though none of them descended thence. Into the lower parts of the earth - So the womb is called, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#015">Psa 139:15</a>; the grave, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#009">Psa 63:9</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#010">Ephesians 4:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">eph 4:10</a></font></span></p>He that descended - That thus amazingly humbled himself. Is the same that ascended - That was so highly exalted. That he might fill all things - The whole church, with his Spirit, presence, and operations. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#011">Ephesians 4:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">eph 4:11</a></font></span></p>And, among other his free gifts, he gave some apostles - His chief ministers and special witnesses, as having seen him after his resurrection, and received their commission immediately from him. And same prophets, and some evangelists - A prophet testifies of things to come; an evangelist of things past: and that chiefly by preaching the gospel before or after any of the apostles. All these were extraordinary officers. The ordinary were. Some pastors - Watching over their several flocks. And some teachers - Whether of the same or a lower order, to assist them, as occasion might require. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#012">Ephesians 4:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">eph 4:12</a></font></span></p>In this verse is noted the office of ministers; in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#013">Eph 4:13</a>, the aim of the saints; in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#014">Eph 4:14-16</a>, the way of growing in grace. And each of these has three parts, standing in the same order. For the perfecting the saints - The completing them both in number and their various gifts and graces. To the work of the ministry - The serving God and his church in their various ministrations. To the edifying of the body of Christ - The building up this his mystical body in faith, love, holiness. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#013">Ephesians 4:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">eph 4:13</a></font></span></p>Till we all - And every one of us. Come to the unity of the faith, and knowledge of the Son of God - To both an exact agreement in the Christian doctrine, and an experimental knowledge of Christ as the Son of God. To a perfect man - To a state of spiritual manhood both in understanding and strength. To the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ - To that maturity of age and spiritual stature wherein we shall be filled with Christ, so that he will be all in all. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#014">Ephesians 4:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">eph 4:14</a></font></span></p>Fluctuating to and fro - From within, even when there is no wind. And carried about with every wind - From without; when we are assaulted by others, who are unstable as the wind. By the sleight of men - By their "cogging the dice;" so the original word implies. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#015">Ephesians 4:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">eph 4:15</a></font></span></p>Into him - Into his image and Spirit, and into a full union with him. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#016">Ephesians 4:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">eph 4:16</a></font></span></p>From whom the whole mystical body fitly joined together - All the parts being fitted for and adapted to each other, and most exactly harmonizing with the whole. And compacted - Knit and cemented together with the utmost firmness. Maketh increase by that which every joint supplieth - Or by the mutual help of every joint. According to the effectual working in the measure of every member - According as every member in its measure effectually works for the support and growth of the whole. A beautiful allusion to the human body, composed of different joints and members, knit together by various ligaments, and furnished with vessels of communication from the head to every part. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#017">Ephesians 4:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">eph 4:17</a></font></span></p>This therefore I say - He returns thither where he begun, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#001">Eph 4:1</a>. And testify in the Lord - In the name and by the authority of the Lord Jesus. In the vanity of their mind - Having lost the knowledge of the true God, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#021">Rom 1:21</a>. This is the root of all evil walking. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#018">Ephesians 4:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">eph 4:18</a></font></span></p>Having their understanding darkened, through the ignorance that is in them - So that they are totally void of the light of God, neither have they any knowledge of his will. Being alienated from the life of God - Utter strangers to the divine, the spiritual life. Through the hardness of their hearts - Callous and senseless. And where there is no sense, there can be no life. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#019">Ephesians 4:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">eph 4:19</a></font></span></p>Who being past feeling - The original word is peculiarly significant. It properly means, past feeling pain. Pain urges the sick to seek a remedy, which, where there is no pain, is little thought of. Have given themselves up - Freely, of their own accord. Lasciviousness is but one branch of uncleanness, which implies impurity of every kind. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#020">Ephesians 4:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">eph 4:20</a></font></span></p>But ye have not so learned Christ - That is, ye cannot act thus, now ye know him, since you know the Christian dispensation allows of no sin. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#021">Ephesians 4:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">eph 4:21</a></font></span></p>Seeing ye have heard him - Teaching you inwardly by his Spirit. As the truth is in Jesus - According to his own gospel. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#022">Ephesians 4:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">eph 4:22</a></font></span></p>The old man - That is, the whole body of sin. All sinful desires are deceitful; promising the happiness which they cannot give. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#023">Ephesians 4:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">eph 4:23</a></font></span></p>The spirit of your mind - The very ground of your heart. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#024">Ephesians 4:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">eph 4:24</a></font></span></p>The new man - Universal holiness. After - In the very image of God. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#025">Ephesians 4:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">eph 4:25</a></font></span></p>Wherefore - Seeing ye are thus created anew, walk accordingly, in every particular. For we are members one of another - To which intimate union all deceit is quite repugnant. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#026">Ephesians 4:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">eph 4:26</a></font></span></p>Be ye angry, and sin not - That is, if ye are angry, take heed ye sin not. Anger at sin is not evil; but we should feel only pity to the sinner. If we are angry at the person, as well as the fault, we sin. And how hardly do we avoid it. Let not the sun go down upon your wrath - Reprove your brother, and be reconciled immediately. Lose not one day. A clear, express command. Reader, do you keep it? 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#027">Ephesians 4:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">eph 4:27</a></font></span></p>Neither give place to the devil - By any delay. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#028">Ephesians 4:28</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_028">eph 4:28</a></font></span></p>But rather let him labour - Lest idleness lead him to steal again. And whoever has sinned in any kind ought the more zealously to practise the opposite virtue. That he may have to give - And so be no longer a burden and nuisance, but a blessing, to his neighbours. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#029">Ephesians 4:29</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">eph 4:29</a></font></span></p>But that which is good - Profitable to the speaker and hearers. To the use of edifying - To forward them in repentance, faith, or holiness. That it may minister grace - Be a means of conveying more grace into their hearts. Hence we learn, what discourse is corrupt, as it were stinking in the nostrils of God; namely, all that is not profitable, not edifying, not apt to minister grace to the hearers. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#030">Ephesians 4:30</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_030">eph 4:30</a></font></span></p>Grieve not the Holy Spirit - By any disobedience. Particularly by corrupt discourse; or by any of the following sins. Do not force him to withdraw from you, as a friend does whom you grieve by unkind behaviour. The day of redemption - That is, the day of judgment, in which our redemption will be completed. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#031">Ephesians 4:31</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_031">eph 4:31</a></font></span></p>Let all bitterness - The height of settled anger, opposite to kindness, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#032">Eph 4:32</a>. And wrath - Lasting displeasure toward the ignorant, and them that are out of the way, opposite to tenderheartedness. And anger - The very first risings of disgust at those that injure you, opposite to forgiving one another. And clamour - Or bawling. "I am not angry," says one; "but it is my way to speak so." Then unlearn that way: it is the way to hell. And evil speaking - Be it in ever so mild and soft a tone, or with ever such professions of kindness. Here is a beautiful retrogradation, beginning with the highest, and descending to the lowest, degree of the want of love. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#032">Ephesians 4:32</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_032">eph 4:32</a></font></span></p>As God, showing himself kind and tenderhearted in the highest degree, hath forgiven you.
