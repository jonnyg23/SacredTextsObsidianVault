 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#001">Nahum 2:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">nah 2:1</a></font></span></p>He - The Medes or Chaldeans, that dash Nineveh in pieces. The munition - The forts. Make thy loins strong - Strengthen thyself. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#002">Nahum 2:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">nah 2:2</a></font></span></p>For - Israel and Jacob were more to God, yet he punished them; much more will he punish Nineveh. Turned - Laid low. The excellency - The wealth, the valiant men, all that Jacob gloried in. Jacob - The two tribes. Israel - The ten tribes. Emptied them - Quite exhausted them. Their vine - branches - Destroyed all the fruit of the land. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#003">Nahum 2:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">nah 2:3</a></font></span></p>The shield - One part for the whole of the armour, and furniture. Mighty men - Medes or Chaldeans. Red - With the blood of the slain. Torches - Torches were always carried in them. In the day - When he shall muster his armies. Shaken - By axes cutting them down for the war. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#004">Nahum 2:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">nah 2:4</a></font></span></p>In the streets - Of Nineveh, when taken. Justle - By reason of their multitude and fury. In the broad ways - Where is most room, and yet scarce enough for them to move. Like torches - What with sparkling fire caused by their horses and chariots, what with the glittering of the polished irons about them, and what with the light of flaming torches carried in them. Like the lightnings - Both for speed, irrestibleness and terror. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#005">Nahum 2:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">nah 2:5</a></font></span></p>He - The king of Babylon. His worthies - Approved officers and commanders. Stumble - Shew such forwardness, that they shall not stand to pick their way. They - The Assyrians to defend, the Chaldeans to assault the walls of Nineveh. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#006">Nahum 2:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">nah 2:6</a></font></span></p>The gates - Of the city toward the river. The rivers - Of the Tigris, upon which Nineveh stood. Dissolved - While the Chaldeans besieged Nineveh, a mighty deluge overthrew the walls of Nineveh, by the space of twenty furlongs, through which breach the besiegers made their entrance. Dissolved - As if melted, it shall drop to pieces. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#007">Nahum 2:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">nah 2:7</a></font></span></p>Huzzab - The queen. The voice of doves - Sighing out their complaints. Upon their breasts - Instead of musical instruments, on which they were used to play, now they only strike their breasts. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#008">Nahum 2:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">nah 2:8</a></font></span></p>Like a pool - Very populous, like a pool which hath been long breeding fish, and is full of them. Yet - Yet these multitudes shall flee discomfited and terrified. They - The chieftains, and most valiant among the Ninevites. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#009">Nahum 2:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">nah 2:9</a></font></span></p>Take - Thus the Chaldeans encourage one another in the plundering of the city. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#011">Nahum 2:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">nah 2:11</a></font></span></p>Of the lions - Tyrants and bloody warriors. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#012">Nahum 2:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">nah 2:12</a></font></span></p>Did tear - Formerly fell upon his neighbour nations. His lionesses - Queens, concubines, or ladies in the Assyrian court. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#013">Nahum 2:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">nah 2:13</a></font></span></p>I will burn her - Nineveh. In the smoke - The city being first plundered, then burnt; these chariots were burnt in that smoke. Thy prey - Cause thee to cease from making a prey any more. Thy messengers - Embassadors or muster - masters. Probably this refers to Rabshaketh who had blasphemed the living God. Those are not worthy to be heard again, that have once spoken reproachfully against God.
