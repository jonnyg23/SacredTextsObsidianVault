 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#001">Psalms Chapter 144</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#002">Psalms 144:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">psa 144:2</a></font></span></p>Subdued - Who hath disposed my peoples hearts to receive and obey me as their king. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#005">Psalms 144:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">psa 144:5</a></font></span></p>Come - To help me. Smoke - As Sinai did at thy glorious appearance, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#018">Exo 19:18</a>. This is a figurative and poetical description of God's coming to take vengeance upon his enemies. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#007">Psalms 144:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">psa 144:7</a></font></span></p>Strange children - Either of the Heathen nations: or of the rebellious Israelites. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#008">Psalms 144:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">psa 144:8</a></font></span></p>Vanity - Vain brags and threatenings which shall come to nothing. Falsehood - Deceiving themselves, by being unable to do what they designed; and others, by not giving them that help which they promised. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#012">Psalms 144:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">psa 144:12</a></font></span></p>That - This mercy I beg not only for my own sake, but for the sake of thy people, that they may enjoy those blessings which thou hast promised them; and particularly, that our sons, who are the strength and hopes of a nation, may be like plants, flourishing and growing in height and strength, as plants do in their youth; for when they grow old, they wither and decay. Cornerstone - Strong and beautiful. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#014">Psalms 144:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">psa 144:14</a></font></span></p>Breaking in - Of enemies invading the land, or assaulting our cities, and making breaches in their walls. Going out - Of our people, either out of the cities to fight with an invading enemy: or out of the land into captivity.
