 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">rut 3:3</a></font></span></p>Raiment - Thy best raiment. Known - In so familiar a way, as thou mayest do hereafter.

 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#008">Ruth 3:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">rut 3:8</a></font></span></p>At midnight - He did not discover her sooner. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#009">Ruth 3:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">rut 3:9</a></font></span></p>Spread thy Skirt - That is, take me to be thy wife, and perform the duty of an husband to me. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#010">Ruth 3:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">rut 3:10</a></font></span></p>Shewed kindness - Both to thy deceased husband, the continuance of whose name and memory thou seekest; and to thy mother - in - law, whose commands thou hast punctually obeyed.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">rut 3:13</a></font></span></p>Perform, &amp;c. - Take thee to wife, to raise up seed to his brother. Bishop Hall sums up the matter thus. "Boaz, instead of touching her as a wanton, blesseth her as a father, encourages her as a friend, promises her as a kinsman, rewards her as a patron, and sends her away laden with hopes and gifts, no less chast, but more happy than she came. O admirable temperance, worthy the progenitor of him, in whose lips and heart there was no guile!" 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#014">Ruth 3:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">rut 3:14</a></font></span></p>Let it not, &amp;c. - He takes care to preserve not only his conscience towards God, but his reputation, and hers also, among men.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">rut 3:16</a></font></span></p>Who art thou? - This is not a question of doubting, but of wonder, as if she had said, Art thou in very deed my daughter? I can hardly believe it. How camest thou hither in this manner, and thus early?
