 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#001">Isaiah 20:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">isa 20:1</a></font></span></p>Sargon - Sennacherib, who, before he came to Jerusalem, came up against and took all the walled cities of Judah, of which Ashdod might be reckoned one, as being in the tribe of Judah. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#002">Isaiah 20:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">isa 20:2</a></font></span></p>Sackcloth - Which he wore in token of his grief for the calamities that were already come upon Israel, and were coming upon Judah. Naked - Not wholly naked, but without his upper garment, as slaves and prisoners used to do, whose posture he was to represent. Bare - foot - After the manner of mourners and captives. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#003">Isaiah 20:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">isa 20:3</a></font></span></p>Three years - Not constantly, but when he went abroad among the people, to whom this was appointed for a sign. A sign - When this judgment should come, namely, three years after this prophecy.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">isa 20:5</a></font></span></p>They - All that shall trust to them. But under this general expression the Israelites, seem to be principally intended. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#006">Isaiah 20:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">isa 20:6</a></font></span></p>Of the country - Of this land, in which the prophet was, and to whose inhabitants, these words were uttered. Such - So vain is our hope placed upon such a people as are unable to deliver themselves.
