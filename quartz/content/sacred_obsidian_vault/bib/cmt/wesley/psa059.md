 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#004">Psalms 59:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">psa 59:4</a></font></span></p>Run - To and fro, to receive Saul's commands, and to execute them with all speed. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#005">Psalms 59:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">psa 59:5</a></font></span></p>The God - A God in covenant with all true Israelites, whom thou hast promised to protect and bless. The heathen - Or, these heathens, who though they are Israelites by birth; yet in their dispositions they are mere Heathens. Be not - For indeed thou canst not according to thy word, be merciful to such incorrigible offenders. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#006">Psalms 59:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">psa 59:6</a></font></span></p>Return - Watching for me: which they did at this time all the night long, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#011">Sa1 19:11</a>. A dog - When he is pursuing his prey. Go round - When they did not find him in his own house, they sought for him in other parts of the city. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#007">Psalms 59:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">psa 59:7</a></font></span></p>Pour out - Sharp and bitter word's, abundantly and vehemently, as a fountain doth waters, as this word signifies. Swords - Words as keen and mischievous as swords. For who - David doth not hear us, and God either doth not hear, or not regard what we say. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#010">Psalms 59:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">psa 59:10</a></font></span></p>Prevent - Thou wilt help me sooner than I expect. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#011">Psalms 59:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">psa 59:11</a></font></span></p>My people - Over whom thou hast appointed me to be governor in due time. Forget - Their former danger, and thy glorious mercy in delivering them. Scatter - Let them wander from place to place, that they may carry the tokens of thy justice, and their own shame to all places. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#012">Psalms 59:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">psa 59:12</a></font></span></p>Pride - For their proud and insolent speeches against thee. Lying - For their execrations and lying reports, which they have spread concerning me. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#013">Psalms 59:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">psa 59:13</a></font></span></p>Not be - In the land of the living any more.
