 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#003">Psalms 41:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">psa 41:3</a></font></span></p>Make his bed - Give him ease and comfort, which sick men receive by the help of those who turn and stir up their bed, to make it soft and easy for them. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#004">Psalms 41:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">psa 41:4</a></font></span></p>Heal - The soul is said to be healed, when it is pardoned and purged. For - For I acknowledge that I have sinned. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#006">Psalms 41:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">psa 41:6</a></font></span></p>His heart - Even when he is with me, and pretends hearty affection, his heart is devising mischief against me. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#009">Psalms 41:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">psa 41:9</a></font></span></p>Yea - These words were literally fulfilled in David, and yet the Holy Ghost looked farther in them, even to Christ and Judas, in whom they received a fuller accomplishment. Lift up - A phrase implying injury, joined with insolency and contempt; taken from an unruly horse, which kicks at him that owns and feeds him. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#010">Psalms 41:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">psa 41:10</a></font></span></p>Requite - Punish them for their wicked practices; which being now a magistrate, he was obliged to do. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#011">Psalms 41:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">psa 41:11</a></font></span></p>By this - Because hitherto thou hast supported me, and prolonged my days to the disappointment of their hopes. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#012">Psalms 41:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">psa 41:12</a></font></span></p>Settest - Or, hast confirmed me in thy presence, under thine eye and special care: to minister unto thee, as a king over thy people. And in regard of his posterity, the kingdom was established for ever. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#013">Psalms 41:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">psa 41:13</a></font></span></p>Amen - Signifies an hearty assent and approbation, and withal an earnest desire of the thing, to which it is annexed. And as the psalms are divided into five books, so each of them is closed with this word; the first here: the second, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#019">Psa 72:19</a>, the third, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#052">Psa 89:52</a>, the fourth, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#048">Psa 106:48</a>, the last in the end of <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa150.htm#006">Psa 150:6</a>, the doubling of the word shews the fervency of his spirit, in this work of praising God.
