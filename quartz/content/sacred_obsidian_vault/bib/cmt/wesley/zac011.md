 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">zac 11:9</a></font></span></p>Then - After that time of his patient feeding the flock, and cutting off the unfaithful shepherds.

 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#012">Zechariah 11:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">zac 11:12</a></font></span></p>And I said - Upon parting, Christ seems after the manner of men, to mind them of his claims for them, and desire them to reckon with him. If ye think good - He puts it to them, whether they thought he deserved ought at their hands? So they - The rulers of the Jews, the high priest, chief priests, and pharisees. Weighed - Which was the manner of paying money in those days. Thirty pieces - Which amounts to thirty - seven shillings and six - pence, the value of the life of a slave, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#032">Exo 21:32</a>. This was fulfilled when they paid Judas Iscariot so much to betray Christ. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#013">Zechariah 11:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">zac 11:13</a></font></span></p>The Lord - God the Father. Cast it - As being so little, it would hardly purchase any thing but what was the cheapest among them. A goodly price - God upbraids the shepherds of his people, who prized the great Shepherd no higher. Cast them to the potter - Or rather, cast them into the house of the Lord for the potter; all which the Jewish rulers acted over.

I cut asunder - Christ did it really, the prophet did it in the type. Break - Declare it broken. The brother - hood - That friendship which had been among them. Judah - The two tribes, and the remnant of the ten tribes. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#015">Zechariah 11:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">zac 11:15</a></font></span></p>Take unto thee - O Zechariah, personate a shepherd quite different from him thou hast represented. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#016">Zechariah 11:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">zac 11:16</a></font></span></p>Who shall not visit - Who seeks not out those that are lost. The young one - Which are aptest to perish through weakness. Nor heal - But leaves it to die of its wounds. That stand still - Not able to go forward. Will eat - Feast on the fattest of the flock. Tear their claws - Tear off their skin unto the very nails; in brief, a sluggish, negligent, covetous, riotous, oppressive, and cruel government, is shadowed out by a foolish shepherd. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#017">Zechariah 11:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">zac 11:17</a></font></span></p>The idol shepherd - To them that are but the images of shepherds. That leaveth - Casts off the care of the flock. The sword - Of the enemy, shall break his strength and be - fool his counsels. Dried up - They that have gifts which qualify them to do good, if they do it not, they will be taken away. They that should have been workmen, but were slothful, and would do nothing, will justly have their arm dried up. And they that should have been watchmen, but were drowsy, will justly have their eye blinded.
