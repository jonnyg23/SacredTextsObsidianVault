 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">pro 8:1</a></font></span></p>Wisdom - It is a great question what this wisdom is.

Possibly both may be joined together, and the chapter may be understood of Christ considered partly in his personal capacity, and partly in regard of his office, which was to impart the mind and will of God to mankind.
