 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#001">Numbers Chapter 10</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#002">Numbers 10:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">num 10:2</a></font></span></p>Two trumpets - For Aaron's two sons: though afterwards the number of the trumpets was much increased, as the number of the priests also was. These trumpets were ordained, both for signification of the great duty of ministers, to preach the word; and for use, as here follows. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#006">Numbers 10:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">num 10:6</a></font></span></p>For their journeys - As a sign for them to march forward, and consequently for the rest to follow them. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#009">Numbers 10:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">num 10:9</a></font></span></p>Ye shall be saved - If you use this ordinance of God with trust and dependance upon God for help. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#010">Numbers 10:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">num 10:10</a></font></span></p>In the days of your gladness - Days appointed for rejoicing and thanksgiving to God for former mercies, or deliverances. Your solemn days - Your stated festivals. For a memorial - That God may remember you for good to accept and bless you. God then takes pleasure in our religious exercises, when we take pleasure in them. Holy work should be done with holy joy. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#012">Numbers 10:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">num 10:12</a></font></span></p>Paran - From which they travelled to other places, and then returned into it again, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#016">Num 12:16</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#021">Numbers 10:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">num 10:21</a></font></span></p>The others - The Gershonites, and Merarites, who therefore marched after the first camp, a good distance from, and before the Kohathites, that they might prepare the tabernacle for the reception of its utensils, which the Kohathites brought some time after them. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#029">Numbers 10:29</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">num 10:29</a></font></span></p>Raguel - Called also Reuel, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#018">Exo 2:18</a>, who seems to be the same with Jethro; it being usual in scripture for one person to have two or three names. And therefore this Hobab is not Jethro, but his son, which may seem more probable, because Jethro was old and unfit to travel, and desirous, as may well be thought, to die in his own country, whither he returned, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#027">Exo 18:27</a>, but Hobab was young and fitter for these journeys, and therefore entreated by Moses to stay and bear them company. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#030">Numbers 10:30</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_030">num 10:30</a></font></span></p>I will not go - So he might sincerely say, though afterward he was overcome by the persuasions of Moses. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#031">Numbers 10:31</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_031">num 10:31</a></font></span></p>Thou mayest be to us instead of eyes - To direct and guide us: for though the cloud determined them to a general place, yet many particulars might be unknown to Moses, wherein Hobab, having long lived in those parts, might be able to advise him, as concerning the conveniences of water for their cattle, concerning the safety or danger of the several parts, by reason of serpents or wild - beasts, or enemies, in the parts adjoining to them, that so they might guard themselves better against them. Or, this is to be understood of his directing them not so much in their way. as about great and difficult matters, wherein the counsel he had from God did not exclude the advice of men, as we see in Hobab's father Jethro, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#019">Exo 18:19-27</a>. And it is probable, this was the wise son of a wise father. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#033">Numbers 10:33</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_033">num 10:33</a></font></span></p>Three days - With continued journeys; only it seems probable, that the cloud made little pauses that they might have time for sleep and necessary refreshments. The ark went before them - Altho' in their stations it was in the middle, yet in their marches it went before them; and the cloud was constantly over the ark whether it stood or went; therefore the ark is said to go before and direct them, not as if the ark could be seen of all the camps, which being carried only upon mens shoulders was impossible; but because the cloud, which always attended upon the ark, and did, together with the ark, constitute, in a manner, one sign of God's presence, did lead and direct them. To search out - A metaphorical expression, for discovering to them; for the ark could not search, and God, who knew all places and things, needed not to search. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#034">Numbers 10:34</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_034">num 10:34</a></font></span></p>By day - And by night too, as was expressed before. So we must learn to compare places of scripture, and to supply the defects of one out of another, as we do in all authors. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#036">Numbers 10:36</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_036">num 10:36</a></font></span></p>Return - Or, give rest, that is, a safe and quiet place, free from enemies and dangers.
