 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#001">2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 5</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#002">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">sa2 5:2</a></font></span></p>Shalt feed - That is, rule them, and take care of them, as a shepherd doth of his sheep, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#070">Psa 78:70-71</a>. This expression, he useth to admonish David, that he was not made a king to advance his own glory, but for the good of his people; whom he ought to rule with all tenderness, and to watch over with all diligence. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#003">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">sa2 5:3</a></font></span></p>A league - Whereby David obliged himself to rule them according to God's laws; and the people promised obedience to him. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#006">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">sa2 5:6</a></font></span></p>Cannot come - They confided in the strength of their fortifications, which they thought so impregnable, that the blind and the lame were sufficient to defend them, against the most powerful assailant. And probably they set a parcel of blind and lame people, invalids or maimed soldiers, to make their appearance on the wall, in contempt of David and his men. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#008">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">sa2 5:8</a></font></span></p>To the gutter - That is, whosoever scaleth the fort, or getteth up to the top of it, where the gutter was. That are hated - The Jebusites, and the lame, and the blind, Who had probably themselves insulted him, and blasphemed God. He shall be - These words are fitly supplied out of <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#006">Ch1 11:6</a>, where they are expressed. They said &amp;c. - That is, whence it became a proverb, or a common saying, used by David, and others, the blind and the lame Jebusites, were set to keep the house, that is, the fort of Zion; and to keep others from coming into it; but now they are shut out of it, and none of them, either of the Jebusites, or of blind and lame persons, shall be admitted to come into it again. Which David might ordain, to keep up the memory of this great exploit, and of the insolent carriage of the Jebusites. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#009">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">sa2 5:9</a></font></span></p>Millo - Which seems to have been the town - hall or, state - house, near the wall of the city of Zion. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#012">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">sa2 5:12</a></font></span></p>King over Israel - That he might be a blessing to them, and they might be happy under his administration. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#013">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">sa2 5:13</a></font></span></p>David took, &amp;c. - This may well be reckoned amongst David's miscarriages, the multiplication of wives being expresly forbidden to the king, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#017">Deu 17:17</a>. It seems to have been his policy, that hereby he might enlarge his family, and strengthen his interest by alliances with so many considerable families. But all these did not preserve him from coveting his neighbour's wife. Rather they inclined him to it: for men who have once broke the fence, will wander carelesly. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#017">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">sa2 5:17</a></font></span></p>The hold - To some fortified place to which his people might conveniently resort from all places, and where he might intrench his army, which lay towards the Philistines. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#020">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">sa2 5:20</a></font></span></p>Baal - perazim - Whither the Philistines were come from the valley of Rephraim, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#011">Ch1 14:11</a>. Baal - perazim, signifies the master of the breaches: So he ascribes all to God. As waters - As floods or rivers of waters, which break the banks, and overflow a land, and overturn all that stands in their way. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#021">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">sa2 5:21</a></font></span></p>Images - When the ark fell into the hand of the Philistines, it consumed them: but when these images fell into the hands of Israel, they could not save themselves from being consumed. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#022">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">sa2 5:22</a></font></span></p>And spread themselves - The expression intimates, that they were very numerous, and made a very formidable appearance. So we read, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#009">Rev 20:9</a>, of the church's enemies going up on the breadth of the earth. But the wider they spread themselves, the fairer mark they are for God's arrows. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#023">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">sa2 5:23</a></font></span></p>Go up - Directly against them, as the following words explain it. Behind - Where they least expect thee; God's purposes and promises do not exclude men's endeavours. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#024">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">sa2 5:24</a></font></span></p>The sound - A noise as it were of persons walking upon the tops of them, which I shall cause; and by this sign, both thou shalt he assured that I am coming to help thee; and the Philistines shall be affrighted, and not perceive the noise of thy army, until thou art upon them. Bestir - Fall upon them.
