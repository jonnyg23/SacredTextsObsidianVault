The day - This day was from his preaching, 'till the utter destruction of Jerusalem, about seventy years after the birth of Christ. A refiner's fire - Some are like metals, which nothing but a fierce fire can purge, such fire shall the troubles of these days be. Fuller's soap - As boiling waters, into which, spotted cloaths are thrown, and as the rubbing of them with soap; so that day will prove to all, a day of great trial, to purge and refine.

He shall purify - The effect of this fiery trial, shall be the thorough cleansing of the persons that are to pass through it.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">mal 3:6</a></font></span></p>I change not - I have an unchangeable hatred to sin: and my long suffering also changeth not, therefore you are not consumed in your sins.
