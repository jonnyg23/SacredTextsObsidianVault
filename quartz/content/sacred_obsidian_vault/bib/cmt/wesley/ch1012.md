 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#002">1 Chronicles 12:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">ch1 12:2</a></font></span></p>Even - Of Saul's own tribe: who were moved hereto by God's spirit, by the conscience of their duty to David; and by their observation of God's departure from Saul, and of his special presence with David. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#004">1 Chronicles 12:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">ch1 12:4</a></font></span></p>Thirty - Who came attended with thirty valiant Benjamites, and was their commander.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">ch1 12:17</a></font></span></p>The God of our fathers - He calls God, the God of our fathers, both his fathers and theirs; thus he minds them, not to deal ill with him; for they were both descendents from the same patriarchs, and servants of the same God. And thus he encourages himself to believe, that God would right him, if he was abused. For he was the God of his fathers; therefore a blessing was entailed upon him: and a God to all Israel in particular, as well as a Judge to all the earth. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#018">1 Chronicles 12:18</a></p>

 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#022">1 Chronicles 12:22</a></p>

 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#029">1 Chronicles 12:29</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">ch1 12:29</a></font></span></p>Kept the ward - Endeavoured to keep the crown in Saul's family. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#031">1 Chronicles 12:31</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_031">ch1 12:31</a></font></span></p>Manasseh - Which was within Jordan: for of the other half beyond Jordan he speaks, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#037">Ch1 12:37</a>.

And they shewed their wisdom at this time; for as they had adhered to Saul while he lived, as knowing the time was not yet come for David to take possession of the kingdom: and as they could not join David, while Abner lived, and had the command of the other tribes wherewith they were encompassed, so as soon as he was dead, and they had opportunity to declare themselves, they owned David for their king. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#033">1 Chronicles 12:33</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_033">ch1 12:33</a></font></span></p>Double heart - They were sincerely loyal, and did not dissemble with David, pretending to be for him, while in their hearts they favoured Saul's family. And none had any separate interests, but all were for the public good.
