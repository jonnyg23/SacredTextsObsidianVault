 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#001">2 Chronicles 6:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">ch2 6:1</a></font></span></p>Thick darkness - He has indeed made darkness his pavilion. But let this house be the residence of that darkness. It is in the upper world that he dwells in light, such as no eye can approach. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#009">2 Chronicles 6:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">ch2 6:9</a></font></span></p>But thy son, &amp;c. - Thus one sows, and another reaps. And let not the wisest of men, think it any disparagement to pursue the good designs which those that went before them had laid. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#014">2 Chronicles 6:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">ch2 6:14</a></font></span></p>O Lord, &amp;c. - By this prayer the temple of Solomon is made a figure of Christ, the great Mediator thro' whom we are to offer up all our prayers, and to expect all God's favours, and to whom we are to have an eye in everything wherein we have to do with God. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#021">2 Chronicles 6:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">ch2 6:21</a></font></span></p>And when they shall, &amp;c. - He asks not, that God would help them without their praying for themselves, but that God would help them, in answer to their prayers. Even Christ's intercession does not supersede, but encourage our supplications. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#041">2 Chronicles 6:41</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_041">ch2 6:41</a></font></span></p>Arise - O thou that sittest in the heavens, arise from the throne of thy glory, and come down into this place, which thou hast appointed for thy constant habitation, from which thou wilt not remove, as formerly thou hast done, from place to place. And the ark - Thou in the ark. Thy strength - Which is the sign and instrument of thy great power put forth from time to time on the behalf of thy people. Salvation - Let them be encompassed on every side with thy protection and benediction. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#042">2 Chronicles 6:42</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_042">ch2 6:42</a></font></span></p>Thine anointed - Of me, who by thy command was anointed the king and ruler of thy people: do not deny my requests, nor send me from the throne of thy grace with a dejected countenance. The mercies - Those which thou hast promised to David and to his house for ever. And thus may we plead, with an eye to Christ, who is called David, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005">Hos 3:5</a>. Lord, remember his merits, and accept of us, on the account of them. Remember the promises of the everlasting covenant, which are called the sure mercies of David, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#003">Isa 55:3</a>. This must be all our desire, all our hope, all our prayer, and all our plea; for it is all our salvation.
