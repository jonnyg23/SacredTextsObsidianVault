 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#001">Hosea Chapter 5</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#001">Hosea 5:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">hos 5:1</a></font></span></p>For judgment - God's controversy is with you all. A snare - You, O priests and princes, have ensnared the people by your examples. Mizpah - By idolatries acted at Mizpah, a part of Libanus. On Tabor - Here, as in Mizpah, idolatry catched men as birds are taken in a net. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#002">Hosea 5:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">hos 5:2</a></font></span></p>The revolters - All those that have cast off the law of God. Profound - Dig deep to hide their counsels, and to slay the innocent. Though I - Hosea. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#005">Hosea 5:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">hos 5:5</a></font></span></p>Doth testify - Is an evident witness against him. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#006">Hosea 5:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">hos 5:6</a></font></span></p>To seek the Lord - The Jewish doctors tell us, that under Hosea, Israel had liberty of bringing their sacrifices to Jerusalem. Shall not find him - God will not be found of them. Hath withdrawn himself - For their impenitency. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#007">Hosea 5:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">hos 5:7</a></font></span></p>Have begotten - They have trained up their children in the same idolatry. A month - Possibly it may refer to Shallum's short time of usurpation, which lasted but a month; the Assyrians shall make a speedy conquest over you. With their portions - With all their substance. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#008">Hosea 5:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">hos 5:8</a></font></span></p>Blow ye - Ye watchmen, sound the alarm, the enemy cometh. After thee, O Benjamin - After thy cries. After thee, O Beth - aven, let Benjamin also cry aloud: for they shall also fall for their sin. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#009">Hosea 5:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">hos 5:9</a></font></span></p>Ephraim - The whole kingdom of the ten tribes. Rebuke - When Salmaneser shall besiege, sack and captivate all thy cities, rebuked for their sins. Of Israel - To the house of Israel openly. Made known - By my prophets. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#010">Hosea 5:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">hos 5:10</a></font></span></p>The bound - The ancient bounds which limited every one, and prevented the encroaching of covetous men. Like water - Like an overflowing flood. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#011">Hosea 5:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">hos 5:11</a></font></span></p>Ephraim - The ten tribes are by seditions, civil wars, unjust sentences, and bloody conspiracies eaten up already. After the commandment - To forbear going to the temple, and to worship the calves at Dan and Bethel, as Jeroboam the son of Nebat commanded. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#012">Hosea 5:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">hos 5:12</a></font></span></p>A moth - Moths leisurely eat up our clothes; so God was then, and had been, from Jeroboam's death, weakening the ten tribes. As rottenness - Secretly consuming them. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#013">Hosea 5:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">hos 5:13</a></font></span></p>His sickness - Weakness, like a consumption, threatening death. Then went - Made application. The Assyrian - Particularly to Israel or Pul. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#014">Hosea 5:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">hos 5:14</a></font></span></p>Will tear - Divine vengeance by the Assyrians, shall be as a lion tearing his prey.
