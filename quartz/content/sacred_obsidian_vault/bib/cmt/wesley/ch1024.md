In like manner Matthias was chosen to the apostleship by lot with prayer. And I know not, says Mr. Henry, but it might be still used in faith, in parallel cases, as an instituted ordinance. Of God - Or rather, of the things of God, that is, of all persons ministering in the sanctuary, and of all holy ministrations done in it, and of all other matters of the Lord, as they are called by way of distinction from, the king's matters, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#011">Ch2 19:11</a>.

So the first lot fell to Eleazar, and the second to Ithamar, the third to Eleazar, and the fourth to Ithamar, so successively, 'till all the families of Ithamar had received their lots. And afterwards all the lots came forth to the rest of Eleazar's families, which were double in number to those of Ithamar.

To come - To come into the temple every sabbath - day, and to continue there 'till the next sabbath, when they were relieved by others.
