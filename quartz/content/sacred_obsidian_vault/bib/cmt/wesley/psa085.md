 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#001">Psalms Chapter 85</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#001">Psalms 85:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">psa 85:1</a></font></span></p>Captivity - The captives. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#004">Psalms 85:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">psa 85:4</a></font></span></p>Turn us - Restore us to our former tranquillity, and free us from the troubles which we yet groan under. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#006">Psalms 85:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">psa 85:6</a></font></span></p>Revive us - Give us a second reviving in bringing home the rest of our brethren, and in restraining our enemies. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#008">Psalms 85:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">psa 85:8</a></font></span></p>Will hear - Diligently observe. Will speak - What answer God will give to my prayers. Peace - He will give an answer of peace. Saints - Not to all that are called God's people, but only to those who are truly such. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#009">Psalms 85:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">psa 85:9</a></font></span></p>His salvation - That compleat salvation for which all the Israel of God wait; even the redemption by the Messiah; of which not only Christian, but even Jewish writers understand this place; and to which the following passages properly belong. And the psalmist might well say this salvation was nigh, because the seventy weeks determined by Daniel were begun. Glory - The glorious presence of God, and the God of glory himself, even Christ, who is the brightness of his father's glory. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#010">Psalms 85:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">psa 85:10</a></font></span></p>Kissed - That great work of redemption by Christ, shall clearly manifest God's mercy in redeeming his people Israel, and in the conversion of the Gentiles; his truth in fulfilling that great promise of sending his son, his righteousness in punishing sin, on his son, and in conferring righteousness upon guilty and lost creatures; and his peace or reconciliation to sinners, and that peace of conscience which attends upon it. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#011">Psalms 85:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">psa 85:11</a></font></span></p>Truth - Truth among men. Righteousness - And God's justice shall be satisfied: he shall look down upon sinful men with a smiling countenance. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#013">Psalms 85:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">psa 85:13</a></font></span></p>Before him - As his harbinger. He shall fulfil all righteousness, he shall satisfy the righteousness of God, and shall advance righteousness and holiness among men. Set us - Shall cause us to walk in those righteous ways wherein he walketh.
