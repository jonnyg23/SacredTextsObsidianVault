 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#001">Micah 7:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">mic 7:1</a></font></span></p>Woe is me - The land is brought in complaining, that whereas it was once well stored, now it hath few good in it. As the grape - gleanings - In Israel and Judah, which in bringing forth good men, should have been a fruitful vine full of clusters: just, compassionate and humble men, are as grapes after the vintage is gathered. Desired - But in vain. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#003">Micah 7:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">mic 7:3</a></font></span></p>Both hands - With all diligence. The great man - The great man at court, who can do what he will there. Uttereth - Is bold to speak plainly. Desire - His unjust, oppressive design. They - They all jointly promote violence and cruelty. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#004">Micah 7:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">mic 7:4</a></font></span></p>As a briar - Mischievous and hurtful. The day - The day in which they shall sound the alarm. Cometh - Surely, speedily, and unavoidably. Now - When that day is come.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">mic 7:7</a></font></span></p>Therefore - Since all sorts of men are so perfidious. Look - As one set in a watch - tower looks round about, and diligently observes all that stirs, so will the prophet; so did they who in Israel and Judah feared the Lord. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#008">Micah 7:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">mic 7:8</a></font></span></p>Rejoice not - The prophet personates the church. Let it be no matter of glorying to thee, that the day of calamity hath overtaken me. In darkness - When affliction, war, famine, and captivity cover me. A light - Shall support, comfort and deliver me. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#009">Micah 7:9</a></p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">mic 7:11</a></font></span></p>Thy walls - O Jerusalem. The decree - Of Artaxerxes, which forbad the re - building of the temple. Removed - Abolished. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#012">Micah 7:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">mic 7:12</a></font></span></p>In that day - After the return out of captivity. He - He who is of Jewish race. To thee - O Jerusalem. The fortified cities - In which many Jews were kept for servile works. To the river - To Euphrates. To sea - From the Caspian to the Persian and to the Midland sea. From mountain - That is, from all parts of their captivity, they shall return to their own country.

With thy rod - In allusion to the custom of shepherds who guided their sheep by a pastoral staff. In the wood - Protect and guide those that in their present captive state are solitary, compassed with dangers. Carmel - A fruitful place and well inhabited. In Bashan - A place of note for fruitfulness. Gilead - Equal with any of the other for plenty and safety.
