 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#001">Job Chapter 32</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#001">Job 32:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">job 32:1</a></font></span></p>Because - So they said: but they could not answer him. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#002">Job 32:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">job 32:2</a></font></span></p>The Buzite - Of the posterity of Buz, Nahor's son, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#021">Gen 22:21</a>. Ram - Or, of Aram; for Ram and Aram are used promiscuously; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#028">Kg2 8:28</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#005">Ch2 22:5</a>. His pedigree is thus particularly described, partly for his honour, as being both a wise and good man, and principally to evidence the truth of this history. He justified - Himself not without reflection upon God, as dealing severely with him, he took more care to maintain his own innocency, than God's glory. The word Elihu signifies, my God is he. They had all tried in vain to convince Job: but my God is he who both can and will do it. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#003">Job 32:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">job 32:3</a></font></span></p>No answer - To Job's arguments as to the main cause. Condemned - As a bad man. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#004">Job 32:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">job 32:4</a></font></span></p>'Till Job - And his three friends. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#006">Job 32:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">job 32:6</a></font></span></p>Afraid - Of being thought forward and presumptuous. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#008">Job 32:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">job 32:8</a></font></span></p>Spirit - The spirit of God. Giveth - To whom he pleaseth. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#009">Job 32:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">job 32:9</a></font></span></p>Judgment - What is just and right. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#012">Job 32:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">job 32:12</a></font></span></p>Convinced - By solid and satisfactory answers. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#013">Job 32:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">job 32:13</a></font></span></p>Left - God thus left you to your own weakness, lest you should ascribe the conquering or silencing of Job to your own wisdom. God - This is alleged by Elihu, in the person of Job's three friends; the sense is, the judgments which are upon Job, have not been brought upon him by man originally, but by the hand of God, for his gross, though secret sins: but, saith Elihu, this argument doth not satisfy me, and therefore bear with me if I seek for better. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#019">Job 32:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">job 32:19</a></font></span></p>Bottles - Bottles of new wine. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#022">Job 32:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">job 32:22</a></font></span></p>I know not - The more closely we eye the majesty of God as our maker, the more we dread his wrath and justice, the less danger shall we be in of a sinful fearing or flattering of men.
