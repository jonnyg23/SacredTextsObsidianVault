 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#001">1 Chronicles Chapter 5</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#001">1 Chronicles 5:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">ch1 5:1</a></font></span></p>Sons of Israel - This is added emphatically, because they were treated as if they had been the immediate sons of Jacob. Not reckoned - This is the second reason, which sheweth both why Reuben's genealogy was not first mentioned; and if another tribe was to be ranked before it, why that was Judah, and not Joseph, because the order of their genealogy was not to be ruled by the birthright, but by an higher privilege, which was given to Judah. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#002">1 Chronicles 5:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">ch1 5:2</a></font></span></p>Judah - Not the person, but the tribe of Judah. Prevailed - Excelled the other tribes, especially in the following privilege. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#009">1 Chronicles 5:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">ch1 5:9</a></font></span></p>Euphrates - From Jordan and the wilderness beyond it unto Euphrates. Or, of the wilderness, which lies towards or reacheth to the river Euphrates, namely, the great wilderness of Kedemoth, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#026">Deu 2:26</a>, which was extended far and wide towards Euphrates: for that was the eastern border of Reuben's possession, and not Euphrates, to which their habitation never reached. Multiplied - Which forced them to enlarge their habitation as far as they could towards Euphrates. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#010">1 Chronicles 5:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">ch1 5:10</a></font></span></p>They made war - Thus God did for his people, as he promised them. He cast out the enemy from before them by little and little, and gave them their land as they had occasion for it. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#014">1 Chronicles 5:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">ch1 5:14</a></font></span></p>These - These seven last named. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#020">1 Chronicles 5:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">ch1 5:20</a></font></span></p>Helped - By God, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#022">Ch1 5:22</a>, who gave them extraordinary courage and success. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#022">1 Chronicles 5:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">ch1 5:22</a></font></span></p>Was of God - Undertaken in his fear, and carried on in a dependence on him. Then we may expect to prosper in any enterprize, and then only, when we take God along with us.
