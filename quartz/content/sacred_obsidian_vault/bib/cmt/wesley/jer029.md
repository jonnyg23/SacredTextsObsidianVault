 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#001">Jeremiah 29:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">jer 29:1</a></font></span></p>Captives - There were two carryings into Babylon, the latter about eleven or twelve years after the former, the first was in the time of Jehoiakim, When the princes, and all the mighty men of valour, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and smiths were carried away.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">jer 29:3</a></font></span></p>By the hand - Zedekiah having some occasion to send two messengers to Babylon. Jeremiah knowing that as there were false prophets at Jerusalem, who fed people with hopes of a speedy return, so there were some with them in Babylon, writes the following letter, and sends it by these two messengers, to quiet the peoples minds. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#010">Jeremiah 29:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">jer 29:10</a></font></span></p>After - From this text it appears that the seventy years captivity, were to be accounted from the first carrying into captivity in the time of Jehoiakim, so that eleven years of it were elapsed, before Zedekiah was carried away.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">jer 29:11</a></font></span></p>To give - This deliverance will not depend upon your merits, but upon my own mercy, and kind thoughts and purposes I have for the seed of Abraham my servant, and I am resolved in my own thoughts what to do, I intend not the blotting out of the name of Israel from the earth, but to give such an end to their trouble as themselves expect and desire. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#015">Jeremiah 29:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">jer 29:15</a></font></span></p>Because - The prophet here turns his speech to some wicked Jews, that were in Babylon, or in Judea.

In the stead - In the stead signifies, that thou shouldest be like the good high priest Jehoiada. Mad - That thou mightest take care of persons, who being mad or frantick make themselves prophets.
