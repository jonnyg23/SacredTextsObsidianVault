 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#001">1 Corinthians Chapter 16</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#001">1 Corinthians 16:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">co1 16:1</a></font></span></p>The saints - A more solemn and a more affecting word, than if he had said, the poor. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#002">1 Corinthians 16:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">co1 16:2</a></font></span></p>Let every one - Not the rich only: let him also that hath little, gladly give of that little. According as he hath been prospered - Increasing his alms as God increases his substance. According to this lowest rule of Christian prudence, if a man when he has or gains one pound give a tenth to God, when he has or gains an hundred he will give the tenth of this also. And yet I show unto you a more excellent way. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. Stint yourself to no proportion at all. But lend to God all you can. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#004">1 Corinthians 16:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">co1 16:4</a></font></span></p>They shall go with me - To remove any possible suspicion. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#005">1 Corinthians 16:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">co1 16:5</a></font></span></p>I pass through Macedonia - I purpose going that way. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#007">1 Corinthians 16:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">co1 16:7</a></font></span></p>I will not see you now - Not till I have been in Macedonia. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#008">1 Corinthians 16:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">co1 16:8</a></font></span></p>I will stay at Ephesus - Where he was at this time. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#009">1 Corinthians 16:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">co1 16:9</a></font></span></p>A great door - As to the number of hearers. And effectual - As to the effects wrought upon them. And there are many adversaries - As there must always be where Satan's kingdom shakes. This was another reason for his staying there. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#010">1 Corinthians 16:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">co1 16:10</a></font></span></p>Without fear - Of any one's despising him for his youth. For he worketh the work of the Lord - The true ground of reverence to pastors. Those who do so, none ought to despise. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#011">1 Corinthians 16:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">co1 16:11</a></font></span></p>I look for him with the brethren - That accompany him. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#012">1 Corinthians 16:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">co1 16:12</a></font></span></p>I besought him much - To come to you. With the brethren - Who were then going to Corinth. Yet he was by no means willing to come now - Perhaps lest his coming should increase the divisions among them. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#013">1 Corinthians 16:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">co1 16:13</a></font></span></p>To conclude. Watch ye - Against all your seen and unseen enemies. Stand fast in the faith - Seeing and trusting him that is invisible. Acquit yourselves like men - With courage and patience. Be strong - To do and suffer all his will. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#015">1 Corinthians 16:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">co1 16:15</a></font></span></p>The first fruits of Achaia - The first converts in that province. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#016">1 Corinthians 16:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">co1 16:16</a></font></span></p>That ye also - In your turn. Submit to such - So repaying their free service. And to every one that worketh with us and laboureth - That labours in the gospel either with or without a fellow - labourer. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#017">1 Corinthians 16:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">co1 16:17</a></font></span></p>I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas, and Fortunatus, and Achaiacus - Who were now returned to Corinth but the joy which their arrival had occasioned remained still in his heart. They have supplied what was wanting on your part - They have performed the offices of love, which you could not, by reason of your absence. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#018">1 Corinthians 16:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">co1 16:18</a></font></span></p>For they have refreshed my spirit and yours - Inasmuch as you share in my comfort. Such therefore acknowledge - With suitable love and respect. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#019">1 Corinthians 16:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">co1 16:19</a></font></span></p>Aquila and Priscilla had formerly made some abode at Corinth, and there St. Paul's acquaintance with them began, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#001">Act 18:1-2</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#021">1 Corinthians 16:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">co1 16:21</a></font></span></p>With my own hand - What precedes having been wrote by an amanuensis. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#022">1 Corinthians 16:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">co1 16:22</a></font></span></p>If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ - If any be an enemy to his person, offices, doctrines, or commands. Let him be Anathema. Maran - atha - Anathema signifies a thing devoted to destruction. It seems to have been customary with the Jews of that age, when they had pronounced any man an Anathema, to add the Syriac expression, Maran - atha, that is, "The Lord cometh;" namely, to execute vengeance upon him. This weighty sentence the apostle chose to write with his own hand; and to insert it between his salutation and solemn benediction, that it might be the more attentively regarded.
