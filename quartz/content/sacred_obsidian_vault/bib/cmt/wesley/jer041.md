Ishmael - The same Ishmael that came to Gedaliah, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#008">Jer 41:8-9</a>, to whom he sware protection; only here we are told he was of the royal blood, which might both raise his spirits, as having a more legal pretence to the government, and rendered him a fitter instrument, for Baalis the king or queen of the Ammonites to make use of. The princes - Some of the princes, who had escaped the army of the king of Babylon. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#003">Jeremiah 41:3</a></p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">jer 41:8</a></font></span></p>He forebare - His covetousness prevailed over his cruelty.
