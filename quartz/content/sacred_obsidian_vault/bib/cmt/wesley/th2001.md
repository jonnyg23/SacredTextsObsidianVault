 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#001">2 Thessalonians Chapter 1</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#003">2 Thessalonians 1:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">th2 1:3</a></font></span></p>It is highly observable, that the apostle wraps up his praise of men in praise to God; giving him the glory. Your faith groweth - Probably he had heard from them since his sending the former letter. Aboundeth - Like water that overflows its banks, and yet increaseth still. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#004">2 Thessalonians 1:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">th2 1:4</a></font></span></p>Which ye endure - "That ye may be accounted worthy of the kingdom." 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#005">2 Thessalonians 1:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">th2 1:5</a></font></span></p>A manifest token - This is treated of in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#006">Th2 1:6</a> and following verses. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#006">2 Thessalonians 1:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">th2 1:6</a></font></span></p>It is a righteous thing with God - (However men may judge) to transfer the pressure from you to them. And it is remarkable that about this time, at the passover, the Jews raising a tumult, a great number (some say thirty thousand) of them were slain. St. Paul seems to allude to this beginning of sorrows, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#016">Th1 2:16</a>, which did not end but with their destruction. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#008">2 Thessalonians 1:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">th2 1:8</a></font></span></p>Taking vengeance - Does God barely permit this, or (as "the Lord" once "rained brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#024">Gen 19:24</a>) does a fiery stream go forth from him for ever? Who know not God - (The root of all wickedness and misery) who remain in heathen ignorance. And who obey not - This refers chiefly to the Jews, who had heard the gospel. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#009">2 Thessalonians 1:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">th2 1:9</a></font></span></p>From the glory of his power - Tremble, ye stout - hearted. Everlasting destruction - As there can be no end of their sins, (the same enmity against God continuing,) so neither of their punishment; sin and its punishment running parallel throughout eternity itself. They must of necessity, therefore, be cut off from all good, and all possibility of it. From the presence of the Lord - Wherein chiefly consists the salvation of the righteous. What unspeakable punishment is implied even in falling short of this, supposing that nothing more were implied in his taking vengeance! 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#010">2 Thessalonians 1:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">th2 1:10</a></font></span></p>To be glorified in his saints - For the wonderful glory of Christ shall shine in them. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#011">2 Thessalonians 1:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">th2 1:11</a></font></span></p>All the good pleasure of his goodness - Which is no less than perfect holiness. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#012">2 Thessalonians 1:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">th2 1:12</a></font></span></p>That the name - The love and power of our Lord may be glorified - Gloriously displayed in you.
