 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#001">3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 15</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#001">3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">kg1 15:1</a></font></span></p>Abijam reigned - So his reign began with Jeroboam's eighteenth year, continued his whole nineteenth year, and ended within his twentieth year, in which also Asa's reign began. And thus one and the same year may be attributed to two several persons. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#002">3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">kg1 15:2</a></font></span></p>Three years - That is, part of three years. Abishalom - Or, of Absalom, as he is called <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#021">Ch2 11:21</a>. And because he is here mentioned as a known person, without any addition of his kindred or quality, some conceive that this was Absalom's daughter, called properly Tamar, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#027">Sa2 14:27</a>, and from her royal grandmother, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#003">Sa2 3:3</a>, Maacah. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#004">3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">kg1 15:4</a></font></span></p>A lamp - A son and successor to perpetuate his name and memory, which otherwise had gone into obscurity. Jerusalem - That he might maintain that city, and temple, and worship, as a witness for God, in the world, against the Israelites and heathen world. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#005">3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">kg1 15:5</a></font></span></p>Save only - This and the like phrases are not to be understood as exclusive of every sinful action, hut only of an habitual and continued apostasy from God, as the very phrase of turning aside from God, or from his commands, doth constantly imply. And thus it is most true. For David's other sins were either sudden and transient acts, soon repented of and blotted out, as in the cases of Nabal and Achish; or, mistakes of his judgment, which was not fully convinced of the sinfulness of such actions: whereas that which concerned Uriah's wife was a designed and studied sin, long continued in, defended with a succession of other sins, presumptuous, and scandalous to his government, and to the true religion. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#006">3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">kg1 15:6</a></font></span></p>War between, &amp;c. - Upon Jeroboam's invading him with a great army: acting then in his own defence, he totally routed Jeroboam, so that he was quiet the rest of his reign. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#010">3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">kg1 15:10</a></font></span></p>Mother's - That is, his grandmother's, as appears from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#002">Kg1 15:2</a>, who is called his mother, as David is called Abijam's father, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#003">Kg1 15:3</a>. And his grand - mother's name may be here mentioned, rather than his mother's, because his mother was either an obscure person, or was dead, or unwilling to take care of the education of her son, and so he was educated by the grand - mother, who, though she poisoned his father Abijam with her idolatrous principles, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#012">Kg1 15:12</a>, yet could not infect Asa, nor withhold him from prosecuting his good purposes of reforming religion. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#011">3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">kg1 15:11</a></font></span></p>Right - As to the government of his kingdom, and the reformation, and establishment of God's worship. That is right indeed which is so in God's eyes. Those are approved whom he commendeth. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#012">3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">kg1 15:12</a></font></span></p>Sodomites - All whom he could find out; but some escaped his observation, as appears from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#046">Kg1 22:46</a>. Idols, &amp;c. - And if his father had made them, he had the more need to remove them, that he might cut off the entail of the curse. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#013">3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">kg1 15:13</a></font></span></p>He removed - He took from her either the name and authority of queen regent, which she, having been Rehoboam's wife, and Abijam's mother, took to herself during Asa's minority; or, the dignity of the queen mother, and those guards, or instruments of power, which she had enjoyed and misemployed. An Idol - Heb. a terror, or horror, that is, an horrible idol; which it may be so called, because it was of a more terrible shape than ordinary, and not to be seen without horror. Kidron - That when it was burnt to powder, it might be thrown into the water, and be unfit for any use. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#014">3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">kg1 15:14</a></font></span></p>High places - <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#003">Ch2 14:3</a>. He took away the altars of the strange gods, and the high places where they were worshipped: but as for those high places where the true God was worshipped he did not take them away; partly, because he thought there was no great evil in them, which had been used by David and Solomon, and other good men; partly, because he thought the removal of them might do more hurt than their continuance, by occasioning the total neglect of God's worship by many of the people, who either could not, or, through want of faith and zeal, would not go up to Jerusalem to worship, now especially, when the Israelites, formerly their friends, were become their enemies, and watched all opportunities to invade or molest them. Was perfect - That is, he sincerely and constantly adhered to the worship of God. Though he could not hinder the people from using the high places, yet he entirely devoted himself to the worship of God in the manner and place prescribed by him. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#015">3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">kg1 15:15</a></font></span></p>His father - Abijam, when he was in distress, and going to fight with Jeroboam, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#001">Ch2 13:1-3</a>, though afterwards he did not perform his vows, nor bring in what he had devoted; probably he was prevented by death. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#017">3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">kg1 15:17</a></font></span></p>Built - That is, repaired and fortified. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#018">3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">kg1 15:18</a></font></span></p>Were left - What either Shishak had left, or Abijam, or Asa, or others, both of Israel or Judah had dedicated; which probably was not inconsiderable, because Asa had got great spoils from Zerah, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#009">Ch2 14:9-15</a>, and he and his numerous and prosperous people, did at this time express a great zeal for the house and worship of God. Sent them - Wherein he committed three great faults, amongst many others, first, he alienated things consecrated to God, without necessity. Secondly, he did this out of distrust of that God whose power and goodness he had lately experienced. Thirdly, he did this for an ill intent, to hire him to the breach of his league and covenant with Baasha, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#019">Kg1 15:19</a>, and to take away part of that land which by right, and the special gift of God, belonged to the Israelites. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#021">3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">kg1 15:21</a></font></span></p>Tirzah - Now the royal city of Israel. There he abode to defend his own kingdoms, and durst not return to oppose Asa, lest the Syrian king should make a second invasion. So Asa met with success in this ungodly course as good men sometimes meet with disappointment in a good cause and course. So there is no judging of causes by events. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#022">3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">kg1 15:22</a></font></span></p>None, &amp;c. - All sorts of persons were obliged to come, except those who were disabled by age, or infirmity, or absence, or by the public service of the king and kingdom in other places. Built - Repaired and strengthened them, for they were built before. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#023">3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">kg1 15:23</a></font></span></p>Nevertheless - Notwithstanding the great things which he had done, and the glory and prosperity which he enjoyed, he felt the effects of human infirmity, and of his own sins. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#025">3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">kg1 15:25</a></font></span></p>Two years - Not compleat, as appears from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#028">Kg1 15:28</a> , <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#033">Kg1 15:33</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#026">3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">kg1 15:26</a></font></span></p>In his sin - In the worship of the calves which his father had made. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#028">3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:28</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_028">kg1 15:28</a></font></span></p>Even, &amp;c. - It was threatened, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#015">Kg1 14:15</a>, that Israel should be as a reed shaken in the water. And so they were, when, during the single reign of Asa, their government was in seven or eight different hands. Jeroboam was upon the throne at the beginning of his reign, and Ahab at the end of it: between whom were Nadab, Baashah, Elah, Zimri, Tibni, and Omri, undermining and destroying one another. This they got by deserting the house both of God and of David. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#029">3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:29</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">kg1 15:29</a></font></span></p>Any - Any of the males of that family. According, &amp;c. - So God overruled Baasha's ambition and cruelty, to fulfil his own prediction. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#030">3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:30</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_030">kg1 15:30</a></font></span></p>Because - So that same wicked policy which he used to establish the kingdom in his family, proved his and their ruin: which is very frequently the event of ungodly counsels.
