 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#001">Jeremiah 8:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">jer 8:1</a></font></span></p>The bones - This denotes the utter desolation of the city, not only rasing the walls, but turning up the very sepulchres which were accounted sacred, and not to be violated.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">jer 8:4</a></font></span></p>Not arise - Will they never think of rising again? Not return - Will he wander for ever? 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#005">Jeremiah 8:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">jer 8:5</a></font></span></p>Deceit - Their false prophets, encouraging themselves in their wickedness, and pleasing themselves, that their miseries should not come upon them. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#006">Jeremiah 8:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">jer 8:6</a></font></span></p>I - God. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#007">Jeremiah 8:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">jer 8:7</a></font></span></p>Appointed time - The seasons of her going and coming. The judgment - God's vengeance, hovering over Jerusalem, and Judea.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">jer 8:8</a></font></span></p>How - These things considered where is your wisdom? He speaks to the whole body of the people. The Lord - This may have a more special eye to the priests. In vain - For any use they made of it; neither need it ever have been copied out by the scribe. A scribe was a teacher, one well versed in the scripture, or esteemed to be so. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#013">Jeremiah 8:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">jer 8:13</a></font></span></p>Pass away - Shall be taken away by their enemies. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#014">Jeremiah 8:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">jer 8:14</a></font></span></p>Why - The people at length seem to bethink themselves, and thus to bespeak each other. Silent - Keep close within our walls. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#016">Jeremiah 8:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">jer 8:16</a></font></span></p>The snorting - The fury of the Chaldeans march is described by the snorting of their horses, which is a noise they make through their nostrils. Heard - Even to Jerusalem. Have devoured - It is spoken in a prophetical style, who use to express the certainty of what shall be, as if it actually were already. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#017">Jeremiah 8:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">jer 8:17</a></font></span></p>Shall bite - There will be no appeasing their fury by any method.

 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#019">Jeremiah 8:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">jer 8:19</a></font></span></p>Why - As if God should seem to reply; let them not think it strange, seeing they have turned their backs upon me, and trusted to idols. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#021">Jeremiah 8:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">jer 8:21</a></font></span></p>Am I hurt - The prophet here shews how deeply he is affected with the peoples misery. Black - I am as those that are clad in deep mourning.
