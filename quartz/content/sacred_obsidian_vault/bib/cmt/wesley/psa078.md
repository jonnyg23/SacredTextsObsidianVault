 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#001">Psalms 78:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">psa 78:1</a></font></span></p>My law - The doctrine which I am about to deliver. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#002">Psalms 78:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">psa 78:2</a></font></span></p>Parable - Weighty sentences. Dark sayings - Not that the words are hard to be understood, but the things, God's transcendent goodness, their unparallel'd ingratitude; and their stupid ignorance and insensibleness, under such excellent teachings of God's word and works, are prodigious and hard to be believed. Of old - Of things done in ancient times. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#005">Psalms 78:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">psa 78:5</a></font></span></p>Established - This is justly put in first place, as the chief of all his mercies. A testimony - His law, called a testimony, because it is a witness between God and men, declaring the duties which God expects from man, and the blessings which man may expect from God.

And the psalmist having related this amazing providence, falls into a large discourse of the causes of it, namely, the manifold sins of that and the former generations, which having prosecuted from hence to <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#060">Psa 78:60</a>, he there returns to this history, and relates the sad consequence of that disaster, the captivity of the ark, and God's forsaking of Shiloh and Ephraim, and removing thence to the tribe of Judah and mount Zion.
