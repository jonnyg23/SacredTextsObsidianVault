 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001">Ezra Chapter 1</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001">Ezra 1:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">ezr 1:1</a></font></span></p>Fulfilled - Nebuchadnezzar carried many of the Jews into captivity in the first year of his reign (the fourth of Jehoiakim). He reigned forty - five years, his son Evil - merodach twenty - three, and his grandson Belshazzar, three years, which make up the seventy years foretold by Jeremiah. First year - Of his reign in Babylon: for he had been king of Persia for many years. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#002">Ezra 1:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">ezr 1:2</a></font></span></p>All, &amp;c. - In those parts of the world; all that vast empire formerly under the Assyrians and Babylonians. The gift of which he ascribes to the great God; by that express prophecy of Isaiah concerning him, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#028">Isa 44:28</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001">Isa 45:1</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#013">Isa 45:13</a>, so long before he was born; which prophecy the Jews had doubtlessly shewed him, which also carried a great evidence with it, especially to him who was so highly encouraged by it: or by a special illumination which God vouchsafed to him, as he did to Nebuchadnezzar and Darius, and some other Heathen princes. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#005">Ezra 1:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">ezr 1:5</a></font></span></p>Then rose up, &amp;c. - These being a new generation, went out like their father Abraham, from this land of the Chaldees, not knowing whither they went. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#006">Ezra 1:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">ezr 1:6</a></font></span></p>Strengthened their hands - God can, when he pleases, incline the hearts of strangers to be kind to his people; yea, make those strengthen their hands, who formerly weakened them. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#008">Ezra 1:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">ezr 1:8</a></font></span></p>Sheshbazzar - Zerubbabel; the Chaldeans called him Sheshbazzar, that is, Joy in tribulation, but among his own people he was called Zerubbabel, a stranger in Babylon. So he looked upon himself, tho' (Josephus says) he was captain of the life - guard.
