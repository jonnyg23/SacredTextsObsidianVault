 <p>From his journey - These words are not in the original text, which is thought to be corrupt. It is best to correct the text, and then simply to translate: "And Solomon came from the high place that was at Gibeon to Jerusalem." 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#014">2 Chronicles 1:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">ch2 1:14</a></font></span></p>
 <p>This passage is very nearly identical with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#026">Kg1 10:26-29</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#002">2 Chronicles 1:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">ch2 1:2</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The narrative here corresponds with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#004">Kg1 3:4</a>; but is very much fuller. We learn from the present passage:
 </p><p>(1) that Solomon's sacrifice at Gibeon was a great public festivity, to which he collected vast numbers of the people;
 </p><p>(2) that it was made upon the brass altar of Bezaleel, which
 </p><p>(3) stood before the tabernacle; and
 </p><p>(4) that Solomon's vision was on the night of his sacrifice. Consult the marginal references
 </p><p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#005">Ch2 1:5</a>
 </p><p>Sought unto it - i. e., "frequented it" - "were in the habit of making use of it." 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#007">2 Chronicles 1:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">ch2 1:7</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The verbal differences between this passage and the corresponding one of Kings <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#005">Kg1 3:5-14</a> are very considerable, and indicate the general truth that the object of the sacred historians is to give a true account of the real bearing of what was said: not ordinarily to furnish us with all or the exact words that were uttered. The most important point omitted in Chronicles, and supplied by Kings, is the conditional promise of long life made to Solomon <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#014">Kg1 3:14</a>; while the chief point absent from Kings, and recorded by our author, is the solemn appeal made by Solomon to the promise of God to David his father <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#009">Ch2 1:9</a>, which he now called upon God to "establish," or to perform.
 </p><p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#012">Ch2 1:12</a>
 </p><p>I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honor - Remark that the writer says nothing of any promise to Solomon of "long life," which, however, had been mentioned in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#011">Ch2 1:11</a> among the blessings which he might have been expected to ask. The reason for the omission would seem to lie in the writer's desire to record only what is good of this great king. Long life was included in the promises made to him; but it was granted conditionally; and Solomon not fulfilling the conditions, it did not take effect (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#014">Kg1 3:14</a> note).
