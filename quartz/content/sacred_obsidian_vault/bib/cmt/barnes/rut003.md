 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Notes on the Bible</i>, by Albert Barnes, [1834], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#001">Ruth Chapter 3</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#002">Ruth 3:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">rut 3:2</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Behold, he winnoweth barley ... - The simple manners of Boaz and his times are here before us. This "mighty man of wealth" assists personally in the winnowing of his barley, which lies in a great heap on the floor <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#015">Rut 3:15</a>, and sleeps in the open threshing-floor to protect his grain from depredation.
 </p><p>Tonight - For the sake of the breeze which springs up at sunset, and greatly facilitates the "cleansing" (separation) of the grain tossed up across the wind. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#004">Ruth 3:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">rut 3:4</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Uncover his feet - Rather, "the place of his feet;" the foot of his bed, as we should say. So also <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#007">Rut 3:7-8</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#008">Ruth 3:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">rut 3:8</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Turned himself - Rather, "bent forward," so as to feel what it was which was at his feet. The same word is translated "took hold of," in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#029">Jdg 16:29</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#009">Ruth 3:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">rut 3:9</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Spread thy skirt ... - The phrase indicates receiving and acknowledging her as a wife. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#010">Ruth 3:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">rut 3:10</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Thou hast shewed more kindness ... - Literally, "Thou hast made thy last kindness better than the first." Her last kindness was her willingness to accept Boaz for her husband, advanced in years as he was. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#012">Ruth 3:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">rut 3:12</a></font></span></p>
 <p>By "kinsman," understand the גאל  gā'al (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#020">Rut 2:20</a> note). 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#015">Ruth 3:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">rut 3:15</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The vail - Quite a different word from that rendered "vail," in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#014">Gen 38:14</a>. It seems rather to mean a kind of loose cloak, worn over the ordinary dress (see the margin).
 </p><p>Six measures - i. e. six seahs, in all two ephahs, twice as much as she gleaned <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#017">Rut 3:17</a>, and a heavy load to carry; for which reason he laid it on her, probably placed it on her head. It is well known that women can carry great weights when duly positioned on their heads.
 </p><p>And she went into the city - The Hebrew has "he went," namely, Boaz, where, accordingly, we find him <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#001">Rut 4:1</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#016">Ruth 3:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">rut 3:16</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Who art thou, my daughter? - In the dim twilight <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#014">Rut 3:14</a> her mother was not sure at first who the young woman was, who sought admittance into the house.
