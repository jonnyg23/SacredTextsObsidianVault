 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#001">Ezekiel 6:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">eze 6:1</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The former prophecies concerned the city of Jerusalem and the inhabitants of Judaea. The present is addressed to the whole land and people of Israel, which is to be included in a like judgment, The ground of the judgment is "idolatry," and the whole rests on Deut. 12. The prophecy is against the "mountains" of Israel, because the mountains and valleys were the seats of idol-worship. It is also the proclamation of the final judgment of Israel. It is the picture of the future judgment of the world. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#003">Ezekiel 6:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">eze 6:3</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Rivers - Or, "ravines," which were, like the mountains, favorite seats of idol-rites <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#010">Kg2 23:10</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#004">Ezekiel 6:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">eze 6:4</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Images - See the margin and margin reference, and the <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#016">Eze 8:16</a> note.
 </p><p>Idols - The Phoenicians were in the habit of setting up "heaps" or "pillars" of stone in honor of their gods, which renders the use of the word more appropriate. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#007">Ezekiel 6:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">eze 6:7</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The force of the words is, "When the slain shall fall in the midst of you, then at last ye shall know that I am the Lord." So in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#010">Eze 6:10</a> where the knowledge implies a recognition of the merciful intent of Yahweh's dispensations, and therefore, a hope of restoration. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#009">Ezekiel 6:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">eze 6:9</a></font></span></p>
 <p>I am broken ... - Translate: "because" I have broken "their whorish heart, which hath departed from me," and their eyes etc. Since Ezekiel is addressing the Church of God through Israel, we are to note here that the general principle of the divine administration is laid down. Sin leads to judgment, judgment to repentance, repentance to forgiveness, forgiveness to reconciliation, reconciliation to a knowledge of communion with God. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#011">Ezekiel 6:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">eze 6:11</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The gleam of hope is but transitory. Darkness again gathers round, for as yet the prophet is predicting judgment.
 </p><p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#011">Eze 6:11</a>
 </p><p>Smite ... stamp - Well-known modes of expressing grief.
 </p><p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#013">Eze 6:13</a>
 </p><p>Sweet savor - Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#021">Gen 8:21</a>. Words, applied to the smell of sacrifices accepted by God, applied here to idol-sacrifices in irony.
 </p><p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#014">Eze 6:14</a>
 </p><p>Toward Diblath - Or, "Diblathaim," the "Diblathan" of the Moabite stone, one of the double cities of Moab (see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#009">Eze 25:9</a>) to the east of which lay the great desert of Arabia. Some read: "unto Riblah" <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#009">Jer 52:9</a> and take the margin rendering.
