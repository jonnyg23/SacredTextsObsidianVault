 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Notes on the Bible</i>, by Albert Barnes, [1834], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#001">Nehemiah Chapter 8</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#001">Nehemiah 8:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">neh 8:1</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The street - Rather, "the square" or "court." So in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#016">Neh 8:16</a> (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#009">Ezr 10:9</a>). The court seems to have been one between the eastern gate of the temple and the watergate in the city-wall. It would thus lie within the modern Haram area.
 </p><p>Ezra the scribe - This is the first mention of Ezra in the present book, and the first proof we have had that he was contemporary with Nehemiah. Probably he returned to the court of Artaxerxes soon after effecting the reforms which he relates in Ezra 10, and did not revisit Jerusalem until about the time when the walls were completed, or after an absence of more than ten years. It was natural for the people to request him to resume the work of exposition of the Law to which he had accustomed them on his former visit <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#010">Ezr 7:10</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#025">Ezr 7:25</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#002">Nehemiah 8:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">neh 8:2</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Upon the first day of the seventh month - The day of the "Feast of Trumpets" (see the margin reference note). The gathering together of the people, spoken of in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#001">Neh 8:1</a>, was probably to observe this feast. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#004">Nehemiah 8:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">neh 8:4</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The 13 persons mentioned were probably the chief priests of the course (shift) which was at the time performing the temple service. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#005">Nehemiah 8:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">neh 8:5</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Stood up - The attitude of attention and respect. Compare the existing practice of the Christian Church at the reading of the Gospel for the day. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#007">Nehemiah 8:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">neh 8:7</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The names here (and in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#004">Neh 9:4</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#005">Neh 9:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#009">Neh 10:9</a>) seem not to be the personal appellations of individuals, but rather designations of Levitical families, the descendants respectively of Jeshua, etc., who lived not later than the time of Zerubbabel <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#043">Neh 7:43</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#008">Neh 12:8</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#008">Nehemiah 8:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">neh 8:8</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Gave the sense - Either by rendering the Hebrew into the Aramaic dialect, or perhaps simply by explaining obscure words or passages.
 </p><p>Caused them to understand - Either "they (the people) understood what was read;" or, "they (the Levites) expounded as they read." 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#009">Nehemiah 8:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">neh 8:9</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Nehemiah, which is the Tirshatha - Hereto, Nehemiah has called himself פחה  pechâh <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#014">Neh 5:14-15</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#018">Neh 5:18</a>, which is the ordinary word for "governor." Now for the first time he is called 'the Tirshatha'" (see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#063">Ezr 2:63</a> note.)
 </p><p>The people wept ... - Because the Law brought vividly before them their sins of omission and commission. In <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#010">Neh 8:10</a> the Jews were not forbidden to be sorry for their sins, but they were only prohibited from marring a festive occasion with the expression of their sorrow. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#010">Nehemiah 8:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">neh 8:10</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The "sending of portions" to the poor is not distinctly mentioned in any but the later historical Scriptures (compare the margin reference). The practice naturally grew out of this injunction of the Law <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#011">Deu 16:11</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#014">Deu 16:14</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#013">Nehemiah 8:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">neh 8:13</a></font></span></p>
 <p>To understand - Rather, "to consider." 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#014">Nehemiah 8:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">neh 8:14</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The Feast of tabernacles had fallen into abeyance either entirely, or as regarded the dwelling in booths <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#017">Neh 8:17</a>, since the time when it was kept by Zerubbabel <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#004">Ezr 3:4</a>. It is evident that the observance of the Law, impossible during the captivity, was restored slowly and with difficulty after the return. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#015">Nehemiah 8:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">neh 8:15</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The mount - The "mount of Olives" is probably intended.
 </p><p>Pine branches - Rather, "branches of the wild olive." The actual trees named by the Law may have become scarce. It was probably considered that the spirit of the command was kept if branches of trees similar in general character to those named in Leviticus were employed. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#017">Nehemiah 8:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">neh 8:17</a></font></span></p>
 <p>It is not the intention of the writer to state that the Feast of tabernacles had not been kept from the time of Joshua until this occasion (see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#002">Kg1 8:2</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#065">Kg1 8:65</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#004">Ezr 3:4</a>); but that there had been no such celebration as this since Joshua's time. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#022">Kg2 23:22</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#018">Ch2 35:18</a>.
