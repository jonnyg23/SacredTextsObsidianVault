 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Notes on the Bible</i>, by Albert Barnes, [1834], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#001">Numbers Chapter 8</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#001">Numbers 8:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">num 8:1</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The actual lighting of the lamps (compare the marginal references) was to be done to set forth symbolically the special presence which God had now <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#089">Num 7:89</a> actually established among His people. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#005">Numbers 8:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">num 8:5</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The Levites could only undertake their duties Num. 3; 4 after the formal exchange of the Levites for the first-born <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#044">Num 3:44-51</a>.
 </p><p>The distinction between the "consecration" of the priests Lev. 8 and the less solemn "purification" <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#021">Num 8:21</a> of the Levites is marked. These rites of purification are similar to those incumbent on the priests of Egypt.
 </p><p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#007">Num 8:7</a>
 </p><p>Water of purifying - literally, "sin water:" i. e. water to cleanse from sin; no doubt taken from the laver of the sanctuary, which was used by the priests for purification before they went into the tabernacle to minister (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#017">Num 5:17</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#018">Exo 30:18</a> ff).
 </p><p>The "sprinkling" of so large a body of men could have been only general, but tokens of individual purification are specified (compare also <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#008">Lev 14:8</a>).
 </p><p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#008">Num 8:8</a>
 </p><p>The two bullocks were "to make an atonement for the Levites," and therefore are presented in their name. These offerings are similar to those prescribed in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#014">Lev 8:14</a> ff at the consecration of the priests, except that the burnt-offering was on that occasion a ram. The larger victim corresponds to the larger number of the Levites.
 </p><p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#010">Num 8:10</a>
 </p><p>The children of Israel - i. e. through the heads of their tribes, who <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#002">Num 7:2</a> no doubt acted for their tribesmen. This act, the distinguishing feature of the ceremony, represented the transfer to the Levites of the sacred duties originally incumbent on the whole people.
 </p><p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#011">Num 8:11</a>
 </p><p>Offer ... offering - Compare the margin Aaron pointed to the Levites, and then waved his hands, indicating (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#030">Lev 7:30</a> note) that the offering was dedicated to God, and, again, by grant from Him, withdrawn for the use of the priests.
 </p><p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#019">Num 8:19</a>
 </p><p>Make an atonement for the children of Israel - i. e. by performing those services which were due from the children of Israel; the omission of which by the children of Israel would, but for the interposition of the Levites, have called down "wrath" from God, or <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#053">Num 1:53</a> "plague." The institution of the Levites was an extension of that mediatorial system which the people themselves, terrified at the direct manifestations to them of the divine presence, desired; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#025">Deu 5:25</a>. Further, it is suggested to us here as an act of mercy on the part of God; yet even the priests and Levites themselves were not always sufficiently heedful and reverent. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#010">Num 17:10</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#001">Lev 10:1</a> ff; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#006">Sa2 6:6</a> following.
 </p><p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#021">Num 8:21</a>
 </p><p>Were purified - Rather, purified themselves; as directed in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#007">Num 8:7</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#024">Numbers 8:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">num 8:24</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Twenty and five years old and upward - The permanent limit as distinguished from the temporary <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#003">Num 4:3</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#023">Num 4:23</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#030">Num 4:30</a>, though David found it necessary to extend the period of the Levites' service by causing it to commence at 20 years of age <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#024">Ch1 23:24-28</a>. This rule continued in force from the time of David downward (compare on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#017">Ch2 31:17</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#008">Ezr 3:8</a>).
