 <p>A meat offering - Better translated in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#004">Lev 2:4</a> an oblation of a meat offering קרבן  qorbân, see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#002">Lev 1:2</a> מנחה  mı̂nchāh. signifies literally a "gift"; and it appears to have been applied especially to what was given by an inferior to a superior <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#018">Gen 32:18-20</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#011">Gen 43:11</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#015">Jdg 3:15</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#027">Sa1 10:27</a> : but in the technical language of the Law, it regularly denoted the vegetable offerings as distinguished from the animal offerings. Our translators have rendered it "meat-offering", applying the word "meat", according to old usage, as a general term for food. Vegetable-offering or meal-offering would be a more convenient rendering.
 </p><p>The meaning of the מנחה  mı̂nchāh appears to be much more simple than that of the animal sacrifices. The מנחה  mı̂nchāh, as a sacrifice, was something surrendered to God, which was of the greatest value to man as a means of living. It might thus seem to be merely eucharistic. But it should not be overlooked that the grain had been modified, and made useful, by man's own labor. Hence, it has been supposed that the מנחה  mı̂nchāh expressed a confession that all our good works are performed in God and are due to Him.
 </p><p>The order in which the kinds of offering are named agrees with their development in order of time. The burnt-offering and the מנחה  mı̂nchāh answer to the first two offerings on record <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#003">Gen 4:3-4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#022">Amo 5:22</a>.
 </p><p>Three kinds of מנחה  mı̂nchāh are here mentioned; (1) <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#001">Lev 2:1-3</a>; (2) <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#004">Lev 2:4-7</a>; (3) <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#014">Lev 2:14-16</a>. Of each of them a small portion was burned on the altar "for a memorial," and the remainder was given to the priests. The offerings of flour belonged to the priests at large, but those of cakes and wafers to the officiating priests, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#009">Lev 7:9-10</a>. Instructions to the priests are given in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#014">Lev 6:14-23</a>.
 </p><p>Fine flour - finely bolted flour of wheat. It was probably always presented in a bowl, compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#013">Num 7:13</a>.
 </p><p>Oil - For the purpose of anointing and as food; in both senses a symbol of divine grace.
 </p><p>Frankincense - See the <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#034">Exo 30:34</a> note. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#002">Leviticus 2:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">lev 2:2</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Better: "And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons, the priests; and the (officiating) priest shall take from it," etc.
 </p><p>Memorial - The regular name not only for the portion of the מנחה  mı̂nchāh which was burned on the altar <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#009">Lev 2:9</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#016">Lev 2:16</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#012">Lev 5:12</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#015">Lev 6:15</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#026">Num 5:26</a>, but for the frankincense which was laid upon the showbread <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#007">Lev 24:7</a>. It is the word which is applied to the prayers and alms of Cornelius, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#004">Act 10:4</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#003">Leviticus 2:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">lev 2:3</a></font></span></p>
 <p>A thing most holy - literally, a holy of holies. All offerings were holy, including the portions of the peace-offerings which were eaten by the laity; but that was "most holy" of which every part was devoted either to the altar, or to the use of the priests. Such were the minchaahs, the showbread, the incense, and the flesh of the sin-offerings and trespass-offerings. Compare the similar distinction between places <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#033">Exo 26:33</a>. The most holy food was eaten in "the holy place," that is the precinct of the tabernacle, probably in the priests' lodgings; but the priests' portion of the peace-offerings might be eaten by the priests and their families in any "clean place" <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#012">Lev 10:12-14</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#004">Leviticus 2:4</a></p>

 <p>The four kinds of bread and the three cooking utensils which are mentioned in this section were probably such as were in common use in the daily life of the Israelites; and there appears no reason to doubt that they were such as are still used in the East. The variety of the offerings was most likely permitted to suit the different circumstances of the worshippers.
 </p><p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#004">Lev 2:4</a>
 </p><p>Oven - This was probably a portable vessel of earthenware; in shape a cone about 3 ft. 6 in. high, and 1 ft. 6 in. in diameter. Similar jars are now used for the same purpose by the Arabs. After the vessel has been thoroughly heated by a fire lighted in the inside, the cakes are placed within it, and the top is covered up until they are sufficiently baked. Meantime the outside of the vessel is turned to account. Dough rolled out very thin is spread over it, and a sort of wafer is produced considerably thinner than a Scotch oat-cake.
 </p><p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#005">Lev 2:5</a>
 </p><p>A pan - Rather, as in the margin, a flat plate. It was probably of earthenware, like the oven.
 </p><p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#006">Lev 2:6</a>
 </p><p>Part it in pieces - Break, not cut. The Bedouins are in the habit of breaking up their cakes when warm and mixing the fragments with butter when that luxury can be obtained.
 </p><p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#007">Lev 2:7</a>
 </p><p>Fryingpan - Rather, pan, commonly used for boiling. It is possible that the cakes here spoken of were boiled in oil. The "pan" and the "frying pan" <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#005">Lev 2:5</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#007">Lev 2:7</a> may have been the common cooking implements of the poorest of the people. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#011">Leviticus 2:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">lev 2:11</a></font></span></p>
 <p>As for the oblation of the firstfruits - Rather, As an oblation of firstfruits. The words refer to the leaven and honey mentioned in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#011">Lev 2:11</a> which might be offered among the firstfruits and tithes (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#002">Deu 26:2</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#012">Deu 26:12</a>; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#005">Ch2 31:5</a>). Honey, being used to produce fermentation, and leaven (or, a small piece of fermented dough) were excluded because fermentation was an apt symbol of the working of corruption in the human heart. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#013">Leviticus 2:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">lev 2:13</a></font></span></p>
 <p>With all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt - Not only every מנחה  mı̂nchāh, but every animal offering was to be accompanied by salt. It was the one symbol which was never absent from the altar of burnt-offering, showing the imperishablness of the love of Yahweh for His people. In its unalterable nature, it is the contrary of leaven (yeast). The Arabs are said to retain in common use the expression, "a covenant of salt;" and the respect they pay to bread and salt in their rites of hospitality is well known. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#014">Leviticus 2:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">lev 2:14</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Green ears of corn - Rather, "fresh ears of corn;" that is, just-ripe grain, freshly gathered. Parched grain, such as is here spoken of, is a common article of food in Syria and Egypt, and was very generally eaten in ancient times.
 </p><p>Beaten out - Not rubbed out by the hands, as described in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#001">Luk 6:1</a>, but bruised or crushed so as to form groats.
