 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#001">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">sa1 15:1</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The absence of all chronology or note of time is remarkable. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#002">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">sa1 15:2</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Compare the marginal references. It appears <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#048">Sa1 14:48</a> that this expedition against Amalek was not made without fresh provocation. Probably some incursion similar to that described in 1 Sam. 30 was made by them upon the south country at a time when they thought the Israelites were weakened by their contests with the Philistines. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#003">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">sa1 15:3</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Utterly destroy - Rather, "devote to destruction" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#028">Lev 27:28</a> note). When a city or people were thus made cherem, everything living was to be destroyed, and no part of the spoil fall to the conquerors (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#021">Sa1 15:21</a>). The valuables were put into the sacred treasury. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#004">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">sa1 15:4</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Telaim - Probably the same as "Telem" <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#024">Jos 15:24</a>, one of the uttermost cities of Judah, toward the coast of Edom. The name means "lambs," and was probably so called from the numerous flocks.
 </p><p>Two hundred thousand ... - A wonderful contrast with the six hundred men who composed his whole army before <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#015">Sa1 13:15</a>, and a proof how completely for a time the Philistines had been driven back. The separate mention of the men of Judah shows how little union there was between Juduh and Ephraim even at this time; a circumstance which throws light upon the whole after history. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#007">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">sa1 15:7</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The district here described would stretch from Havilah on the extreme east to Shur, either near Suez, or further north on the coast road from Gaza to Egypt. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#008">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">sa1 15:8</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The saving Agag alive was in direct violation of the devotion to destruction. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#009">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">sa1 15:9</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The fatlings - The present Hebrew text cannot be so rendered. It can only mean "the second best" (compare the margin), i. e., sheep of the age to cut or shed the two teeth, sheep in their prime. But it is probable that the reading is corrupt, and that "fat or dainty bits" is the true reading. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#011">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">sa1 15:11</a></font></span></p>
 <p>It grieved Samuel - "Samuel was angry, or displeased," as Jonah was <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#001">Jon 4:1</a>, and for a similar reason. Samuel was displeased that the king whom he had anointed should be set aside. It seemed a slur on his prophetic office.
 </p><p>He cried unto the Lord - With the wild scream or shriek of supplication. (See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#008">Sa1 7:8-9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#018">Sa1 12:18</a>.) The phrase and the action mark Samuel's fervent, earnest character. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#012">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">sa1 15:12</a></font></span></p>
 <p>A place - Rather, "a monument." The Hebrew word יד  yâd means a "hand," but is used in the sense of "monument," or "trophy," in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#018">Sa2 18:18</a>, where we are told that the marble pillar which Absalom set up in his lifetime, was called "Yad Absalom."
 </p><p>Carmel - (see the marginal reference) would be on Saul's line of march on his return from the country of the Amalekites, more especially if he came from the neighborhood of Akaba. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#013">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">sa1 15:13</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Gilgal being within 15 miles of Ramah, Samuel might easily have come from Ramah that morning. Self-will and rashness had hitherto been Saul's chief faults. He now seems to add falsehood and hypocrisy. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#015">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">sa1 15:15</a></font></span></p>
 <p>There is something thoroughly mean in his attempt to shift the responsibility of what was done from his own kingly shoulders to those of the people. Every word uttered by Saul seems to indicate the breaking down of his moral character. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#016">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">sa1 15:16</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Samuel now acquiesces in the wisdom and justice of the sentence which <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#011">Sa1 15:11</a> he had so strenuously resisted at first. What before was known only to the Searcher of hearts, had now been displayed to Samuel by Saul himself. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#018">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">sa1 15:18</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The sinners - As though God would justify His commission to destroy them. (Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#013">Gen 13:13</a>.) 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#021">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">sa1 15:21</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The Lord thy God - There is an implied censure of Samuel in this phrase. Saul says that Samuel blames him for what was done in honor of Samuel's God; as if be had more zeal for the glory of God than was felt by Samuel. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#022">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">sa1 15:22</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Hath the Lord ... - A grand example of the moral and spiritual teaching of the prophets (see the marginal references). The tension of Samuel's spirit, as he is about to pronounce the sentence of rejection, produces a lyrical turn of thought and language. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#023">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">sa1 15:23</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The meaning is "Rebellion is as bad as the sin of divination, and stubbornness is as bad as worshipping false gods (iniquity), and teraphim (idolatry)." 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#024">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">sa1 15:24</a></font></span></p>
 <p>I have sinned - Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#025">Sa1 15:25</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#030">Sa1 15:30</a>. How was it that these repeated confessions were unavailing to obtain forgiveness, when David's was? (See the marginal reference.) Because Saul only shrank from the punishment of his sin. David shrank in abhorrence from the sin itself <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#004">Psa 51:4</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#029">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:29</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">sa1 15:29</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The strength of Israel - A phrase which occurs only here. The word means, perpetuity, truth, glory, victory, and trust, or confidence. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#030">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:30</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_030">sa1 15:30</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The pertinacity with which Saul clings to Samuel for support is a striking testimony to Samuel's integrity. With all his worldly-mindedness Saul could perceive and appreciate the purity of Samuel's character as a man of God.
 </p><p>The Lord thy God - As above, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#015">Sa1 15:15</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#032">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:32</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_032">sa1 15:32</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Delicately - This phrase is very obscure. The meaning of the word so rendered is "dainties, delights" <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#020">Gen 49:20</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#017">Pro 29:17</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#005">Lam 4:5</a>, which hardly gives a tolerable sense here. Some understand it "fawningly, flatteringly," with a view of appeasing Samuel. (Others alter the reading, and translate "in bonds.")
 </p><p>Surely the bitterness ... - Agag hopes that his life will be spared, and so expresses his confident belief that the bitterness of death is over. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#033">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:33</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_033">sa1 15:33</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Hewed in pieces - Only found in this passage. Samuel thus executed the חרם  chērem <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#003">Sa1 15:3</a> which Saul had violated, and so both saved the nation from the guilt of a broken oath, and gave a final example to Saul, but apparently in vain, of uncompromising obedience to the commandments of God. There is something awful in the majesty of the prophet rising above and eclipsing that of the king (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#020">Kg1 21:20</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#014">Jer 38:14</a> ff; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#046">Dan 2:46</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#027">Dan 4:27</a>). 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#035">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:35</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_035">sa1 15:35</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Samuel came no more ... - In the sense of visiting or conversing on public affairs.
