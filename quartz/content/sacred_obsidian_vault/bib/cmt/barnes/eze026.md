 <p>Prophecies against Tyre. The siege of Tyre lasted thirteen years beginning 585 b.c., about three years after the capture of Jerusalem. While besieging Jerusalem, Nebuchadnezzar had driven Pharaoh Hophra back to the borders of Egypt. Tyre being thus relieved from a dangerous enemy, was exulting in her own deliverance, and in her neighbor's ruin, when Ezekiel predicted the calamity about to befall her. The name Tyre means rock, and was given to the city in consequence of its position. This island-rock was the heart of Tyre, and the town upon the continent - called "Old Tyre," possibly as having been the temporary position of the first settlers - was the outgrowth of the island city. The scanty records of ancient history give no, distinct evidence of the capture of insular Tyre by Nebuchadnezzar; but the fact is very probable. Compare especially <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#007">Eze 26:7-12</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#018">Eze 29:18</a>. The present state of Tyre is one of utter desolation, though the end was long delayed (compare Isa. 23). Tyre was great and wealthy under Persian, Greek, Roman, and even Muslim masters. The final ruin of Tyre was due to the sultan of Egypt (1291 a.d.).
 </p><p>In the first day of the month - The number of the month being omitted, many suppose "the month" to mean the month when Jerusalem was taken (the rebirth month), called "the month," as being so well known. The capture of the city is known to have taken place on "the ninth day of the fourth month" and its destruction on "the seventh day of the fifth month." This prophecy therefore preceded by a few days the capture of the city. The condition of Jerusalem in the latter months of its siege was such that the Tyrians may well have exulted as though it had already fallen.

 <p>Gates - i. e., one gate of two leaves.
 </p><p>The people - Or, the peoples (and in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#003">Eze 27:3</a>), the plural expressing the fact that many peoples passed through Jerusalem, as the central place on the highway of commerce, e. g., in the reign of Solomon. This was viewed with jealousy by Tyre, who owed her greatness to the same cause, and in the true spirit of mercantile competition exulted in the thought that the trade of Jerusalem would be diverted into her markets. Render it: Aha! She is broken - the gate of the peoples! She is turned unto me. I shall be filled. She is laid waste.

 <p>Her daughters ... - The subject states upon the mainland, on which she at this time relied for supplies.

 <p>The description of the siege is that of a town invested by land.
 </p><p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#007">Eze 26:7</a>
 </p><p>Nebuchadrezzar - <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#002">Jer 21:2</a> note.
 </p><p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#008">Eze 26:8</a>
 </p><p>Lift up the buckler - i. e., set a wall of shields, under cover of which the walls could be approached.
 </p><p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#009">Eze 26:9</a>
 </p><p>Engines of war - Or, his battering ram. "axes" swords. They who would break flown the towers, rush on with their swords to slay the defenders.
 </p><p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#011">Eze 26:11</a>
 </p><p>Garrisons - pillars, on which stood statues of some protecting god. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#026">Kg2 10:26</a>.
 </p><p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#014">Eze 26:14</a>
 </p><p>The siege had been on land, but the victory was to be completed by the subjection of the island-citadel.

 <p>The effect of the fall of Tyre.
 </p><p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#016">Eze 26:16</a>
 </p><p>Clothe themselves with trembling - Mourners change their bright robes for sad garments.
 </p><p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#017">Eze 26:17</a>
 </p><p>Of seafaring men - literally, "from the seas," i. e., occupied by men who come from the seas. Tyre was an inhabited city rising from out of the sea.
 </p><p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#020">Eze 26:20</a>
 </p><p>Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#009">Isa 14:9</a>. The image used by Isaiah and Jeremiah of Babylon is by Ezekiel applied to Tyre, as if to show that Tyre and Babylon alike represent the world-power. So, in the Book of Revelation, Babylon is the kingdom of Antichrist.
 </p><p>The land of the living - The land of the true God, as opposed to the land of the dead, to which is gathered the glory of the world. Here then, together with the utter ruin of Tyre, rises the vision of renewed glory to Jerusalem. The coming Messiah is thus propheticly pointed out. The over-throw of God's enemies shall be accompanied by the establishment of His true kingdom.
