 <p>Had Absalom gained the victory, it is likely that, according to the manner of Oriental despots, he would have sought to secure his throne by killing all possible competitors <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#005">Jdg 9:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#029">Kg1 15:29</a>.

 <p>David saw the justice of what Joab said, and the new danger which threatened him if he did not rouse himself from his grief.
 </p><p>For Israel ... - Not David's followers, but as before <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#026">Sa2 17:26</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#006">Sa2 18:6</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#017">Sa2 18:17</a>, Absalom's army. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#013">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">sa2 19:13</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Of my bone ... - Render as in preceding verse, "art thou not my bone and my flesh?" It is curious to note how the phrase is used in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#001">Sa2 5:1</a> of common descent from Israel, in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#012">Sa2 19:12</a> of the closer kindred of the tribe of Judah, and in this verse of the yet nearer kindred between David and Amasa his sister's son.
 </p><p>Captain ... in the room of Joab - It is very plain that David felt the weight of Joab's overbearing influence to be very oppressive (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#022">Sa2 19:22</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#039">Sa2 3:39</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#010">Sa2 16:10</a>). He was, at this time, very angry with Joab for killing Absalom; and so, thinking it of vital importance to win over Amasa and the army of Judah, he did not scruple to offer him Joab's high post. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#016">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">sa2 19:16</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Shimei being aware that Judah was unanimous in recalling the king, lost no time in trying to make his peace with David, by bringing a large Benjamite force with him. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#017">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">sa2 19:17</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Before the king - i. e., "to meet the king." Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#008">Sa2 20:8</a>. The king was on the east bank, and they crossed over (by the ford) from the west bank to go to him. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#018">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">sa2 19:18</a></font></span></p>
 <p>As he was come over Jordan - Render, "when he was crossing," i. e., just embarking for the purpose of crossing. The scene still lies on the east bank. Shimei left nothing undone to soften, if possible, David's resentment. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#020">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">sa2 19:20</a></font></span></p>
 <p>This is the first time that the "house of Joseph," or "Joseph," stands for all the ten tribes of which Ephraim was the head and leader. While Saul of Benjamin was king, or while Mahanaim was the capital of his son's kingdom, it was not natural so to name them, nor does it seem so at first sight in the mouth of Shimei the Benjamite. But it is very possible that he used the phrase for the purpose of exculpating himself and his own tribe from having taken the initiative in the rebellion, anti of insinuating that they were drawn away by the preponderating influence of the great house of Joseph. On the other hand, the phrase may be an indication that the passage was written after the separation of the kingdom of Israel, when the phrase was a common one. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#024">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">sa2 19:24</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Beard - The "moustache," the beard of the upper lip. The fact related in this verse tends to clear Mephibosheth from the suspicion of unfaithfulness to David. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#026">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">sa2 19:26</a></font></span></p>
 <p>What appears to have happened is, that when Mephibosheth ordered Ziba to saddle the donkeys and ride with him to join David, Ziba left him under pretence of obeying, but instead laded the donkeys with provisions, and went off alone with them, thus making it impossible for Mephibosheth to follow. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#029">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:29</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">sa2 19:29</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Unable to get to the bottom of the story, and perhaps unwilling to make an enemy of Ziba, David compromised the matter by dividing the land, thus partially revoking his hasty sentence <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#004">Sa2 16:4</a>. We still see the impatient temper of David. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#037">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:37</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_037">sa2 19:37</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Chimham - From marginal references it appears that Chimham, having accepted David's offer, came and settled near Bethlehem. His house was still called after him at the time of the captivity. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#039">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:39</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_039">sa2 19:39</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The "people" is the term especially applied in this narrative to David's followers <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#017">Sa2 15:17</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#014">Sa2 16:14</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#002">Sa2 17:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#001">Sa2 18:1-2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#002">Sa2 19:2-3</a>. They crossed by the ford, while David and his household, accompanied by Barzillai and Chimham, came over in the ferry. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#041">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:41</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_041">sa2 19:41</a></font></span></p>
 <p>It seems that David and his whole party made a halt at Gilgal <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#015">Sa2 19:15</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#014">Sa1 11:14</a>, and possibly made some solemn agreement there about the kingdom. But while they were there, "all the men of Israel," representatives from the tribes not included in "half the people of Israel" <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#040">Sa2 19:40</a>, came up in great wrath at finding that the restoration had been accomplished without consulting them, and accused the men of Judah of unfair dealing.
