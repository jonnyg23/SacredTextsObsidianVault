 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#002">Acts 5:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">act 5:2</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Kept back (ἐνοσφίσατο)
 </p><p>Only here, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#003">Act 5:3</a>, and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#010">Tit 2:10</a>, where it is rendered purloining. From νόσφι, aloof, apart. The verb means to set apart for one's self; hence to appropriate wrongfully. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#003">Acts 5:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">act 5:3</a></font></span></p>
 <p>To lie to (ψεύσασθαι)
 </p><p>Rather, to deceive. The design of Satan was to deceive the Holy Ghost. To lie to would require a different case in the noun, which occults in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#004">Act 5:4</a>, where the same verb is properly rendered lie (unto God). Satan fills the heart to deceive. The result of the attempt is merely to lie. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#004">Acts 5:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">act 5:4</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Whiles it remained, was it not thine own (οὐχὶ μένον? σοὶ ἔμενε)
 </p><p>A play on the words. Lit., remaining, did it not remain to thee? Rev., very happily, whiles it remained, did it not remain thine own?
 </p><p>Conceived (ἔθου)
 </p><p>Lit., put or fixed. Wherefore didst thou fix this deed in thy heart? - i.e., resolve upon it. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#005">Acts 5:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">act 5:5</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Gave up the ghost (ἐξέψυξε)
 </p><p>Used by Luke only. A rare word, occurring in the Septuagint, and in medical writers. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#007">Eze 21:7</a>, "Every spirit shall faint." See, also, on failing, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#026">Luk 21:26</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#006">Acts 5:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">act 5:6</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Wound him up (συνέστειλαν)
 </p><p>Better, as Rev., wrapped him round. The verb means to draw together, or draw in; hence used for shortening sail, reducing expenses, lowering or humbling a person. In <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#029">Co1 7:29</a>, it occurs in the phrase, "the time is short (συνεσταλμένος, Rev., properly, shortened);" i.e., drawn together, contracted. In the sense of wrapping up it is found in Aristophanes, of wrapping cloaks or garments about one; also of tucking up the garments about the loins, as a preparation for service. In the sense of shrouding for burial, it occurs in Euripides ("Troades," 382): "They were not shrouded (συνεπεστάλησαν) by the hands of a wife." In medical language, of bandaging a limb; of the contraction of tumors, and of organs of the body, etc. Some, however, as Meyer, refer the word here to the pressing together of the dead man's limbs.

 <p>Answered
 </p><p>"The woman, whose entrance into the assembly of the saints was like a speech" (Bengel).
 </p><p>For so much (τοσούτου)
 </p><p>Perhaps pointing to the money still lying at his feet. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#009">Acts 5:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">act 5:9</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Ye have agreed together (συνεφωνήθη ὑμῖν)
 </p><p>The verb is passive. Lit., was it agreed by you. The figure in the word is that of concord of sounds. Your souls were attuned to each other respecting this deceit. See on music, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#025">Luk 15:25</a>.
 </p><p>To tempt (πειράσαι)
 </p><p>To put it to the proof whether the Holy Spirit, ruling in the apostles, could be deceived. See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#003">Act 5:3</a>.
 </p><p>The feet
 </p><p>Graphic. The steps of the young men returning from the burial are heard at the door.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">act 5:12</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Were wrought (ἐγένετο)
 </p><p>The best texts read ἐγίνετο the imperfect, were being wrought from time to time.
 </p><p>All
 </p><p>The whole body of believers. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#013">Acts 5:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">act 5:13</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The rest
 </p><p>Unbelievers, deterred by the fate of Ananias from uniting themselves to the church under false pretences.
 </p><p>Join himself (κολλᾶσθαι)
 </p><p>See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#015">Luk 15:15</a>; and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#011">Luk 10:11</a>. In all but two instances (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#009">Rom 12:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#017">Co1 6:17</a>), the word implies a forced, unnatural, or unexpected union. Thus Philip would not, without a special command, have "joined himself" to the chariot of the Ethiopian prince (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#029">Act 8:29</a>). Saul's attempt to join himself to the apostles was regarded by them with suspicion (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#026">Act 9:26</a>); and the fact that certain persons "clave to" Paul in Athens is expressly contrasted with the attitude of the citizens at large. The sense of an unnatural union comes out clearly in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#016">Co1 6:16</a>.

 </p><p>Imperfect: kept being added.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">act 5:15</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Couches (κραββάτων)
 </p><p>See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#004">Mar 2:4</a>.
 </p><p>The shadow of Peter passing by
 </p><p>But the proper rendering is, as Peter passed by, his shadow might, etc.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#018">Acts 5:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">act 5:18</a></font></span></p>
 <p>In the common prison (ἐν τηρήσει δημοσίᾳ)
 </p><p>Incorrect. Τήρησις is not used in the sense of prison, but is an abstract term meaning ward or keeping, as in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#003">Act 4:3</a>. There is no article, moreover. Note, too, that another word is used for the prison in the next verse (τῆς φυλακῆς). Rev., therefore, correctly, in public ward.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">act 5:19</a></font></span></p>
 <p>By night (διὰ τῆς νυκτὸς)
 </p><p>More correctly, during the night: διά, in the course of. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#009">Act 16:9</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#020">Acts 5:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">act 5:20</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Stand
 </p><p>Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#014">Act 2:14</a>; and see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#011">Luk 18:11</a>; and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#008">Luk 19:8</a>.
 </p><p>Of this life
 </p><p>The eternal life which Christ revealed. It is a peculiar use of the phrase, which is commonly employed in contrast with the life to come, as <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#019">Co1 15:19</a>. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#063">Joh 6:63</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#068">Joh 6:68</a>. Not equivalent to these words of life. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#021">Acts 5:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">act 5:21</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Early in the morning (ὑπὸ τὸν ὄρθρον)
 </p><p>Ὑπό, beneath, is often used in the sense of just about, or near. Ὄρθρον, is from ὄρνυμι, to cause to arise: the dawn. See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#001">Luk 24:1</a>. Render as Rev., about daybreak.
 </p><p>Taught (ἐδίδασκον)
 </p><p>Imperfect: began teaching.
 </p><p>The council (συνέδριον)
 </p><p>The Sanhedrim.
 </p><p>The senate (γερουσίαν)
 </p><p>From γέρων, an old man, like the Latin senatus, from senex, old. Taking on very early an official sense, the notion of age being merged in that of dignity. Thus in Homer γέροντες are the chiefs who form the king's council. Compare the Latin patres, fathers, the title used in addressing the Roman senate. The word in this passage is the name of the Spartan assembly, Gerousia, the assembly of elders, consisting of thirty members, with the two kings. "The well-known term," as Meyer remarks, "is fittingly transferred from the college of the Greek gerontes to that of the Jewish presbyters." They summoned, not only those elders of the people who were likewise members of the Sanhedrim, but the whole council (all the senate) of the representatives of the people.
 </p><p>Prison (δεσμωτήριον)
 </p><p>Still another word for prison. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#018">Act 5:18</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#019">Act 5:19</a>. Rev., prison-house. The different words emphasize different aspects of confinement. Τήρησις is keeping, as the result of guarding. See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#018">Act 5:18</a>. Φυλακή emphasizes the being put under guard, and δεσμωτήριον the being put in bonds.

 <p>They doubted (διηπόρουν)
 </p><p>See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#005">Luk 9:5</a>. Rev., were much perplexed, giving the force of διά, thoroughly at a loss. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#004">Luk 24:4</a>.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#028">Acts 5:28</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_028">act 5:28</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Did not
 </p><p>The best texts omit οὐ, not, and the question.
 </p><p>We straitly charged
 </p><p>So Rev. (παραγγελίᾳ παρηγγείλαμεν). Lit., we charged you with a charge. See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#015">Luk 22:15</a>, with desire I have desired.
 </p><p>Intend (βούλεσθε)
 </p><p>Or ye want. See on willing, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#019">Mat 1:19</a>.
 </p><p>This man's
 </p><p>The phrase is remarkable as furnishing the first instance of that avoidance of the name of Christ which makes the Talmud, in the very same terms, refer to him most frequently as Peloni=, "so and so." 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#029">Acts 5:29</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">act 5:29</a></font></span></p>
 <p>We ought (δεῖ)
 </p><p>Stronger, we must.
 </p><p>To obey (πειθαρχεῖν)
 </p><p>Not often used in the New Testament to express obedience, the most common word being ὑπακούω. Sometimes πείθω is used. But this word, in itself, is the only one of the several in use which expresses the conception of obedience exclusively. Ὑπακούνειν is to obey as the result of listening to another: πείθεσθαι is to obey as the result of persuasion. This is the special term for the obedience which one owes to authority (ἀρχή): It occurs four times in the New Testament: <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#029">Act 5:29</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#032">Act 5:32</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#021">Act 27:21</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#001">Tit 3:1</a>; and in every case, of obedience to established authority, either of God or of magistrates. In <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#021">Act 27:21</a>, where it is used of the ship's officers hearkening to Paul's admonition not to loose from Crete, Paul speaks of his admonition as divinely inspired; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#010">Act 27:10</a>. In <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#019">Act 4:19</a>, Peter and John say hearken (ἀκούειν). That is a mere listening to or considering the proposition made to them. This is a deliberate course of action.

 <p>Ye slew (διεχειρίσασθε)

 <p>They were cut to the heart (διεπρίοντο)
 </p><p>Only here and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#054">Act 7:54</a>. The verb means, originally, to saw asunder. A strong figure for exasperation.

 <p>Refrain (ἀπόστητε)
 </p><p>Lit., stand off.
 </p><p>Of men (ἐξ ἀνθρώπων)
 </p><p>Out of men, proceeding out of their devices.
 </p><p>It will come to naught (καταλυθήσεται)
 </p><p>Lit., be loosened down. Used of the dilapidation of the temple (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#006">Luk 21:6</a>), and of the dissolution of the body under the figure of striking a tent (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001">Co2 5:1</a>).

 <p>They were counted worthy to suffer shame (κατηξιώθησαν ἀτιμασθῆναι)
 </p><p>This is an instance of what rhetoricians style an oxymoron, from ὀξύς, sharp, and μωρός, foolish; a pointedly foolish saying, which is witty or impressive through sheer contradiction or paradox, as laborious idleness, sublime indifference. In this case the apostles are described as dignified by indignity.
