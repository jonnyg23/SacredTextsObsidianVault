 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#001">Hebrews 6:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">heb 6:1</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Leaving the principles of the doctrines of Christ (ἀφέντες τὸν τῆς ἀρχῆς τοῦ Χριστοῦ λόγον)
 </p><p>Lit. leaving the word of the beginning concerning Christ. Ἀφέντες leaving or dismissing does not imply ceasing to believe in elementary truths or to regard them as important, but leaving them "as a builder leaves his foundation in erecting his building" (Bruce). The word of the beginning of Christ is practically = the rudiments of the beginning, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#012">Heb 5:12</a>; that rudimentary view of Christ's person and office which unfolds into the doctrine of his priesthood. Up to this point the writer has shown only that the permanent elements of the old covenant remain and are exalted in Christ. The more difficult point, which it will require matured perception to grasp, is that Christ's priesthood involves the entire abolition of the old covenant.
 </p><p>Let us go on unto perfection (ἐπὶ τὴν τελειότητα φερώμεθα)
 </p><p>Lit. let us be born on to completeness. The participial clause, leaving, etc., is related to the verbal clause as expressing a necessary accompaniment or consequence of the latter. Let us be born on to completeness, and, because of this, leave, etc. This sense is not given by the Rev. Τελειότης only here and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#014">Col 3:14</a>. Rend. completeness. The completeness is viewed as pertaining to both the writer and the readers. He proposes to fully develop his theme: they are exhorted to strive for that full Christian manhood which will fit them to receive the fully-developed discussion.
 </p><p>Not laying again the foundation (μὴ πάλιν θεμέλιον καταβαλλόμενοι)
 </p><p>Not explanatory of leaving, etc. The following words, describing the elements of the foundation, - repentance, baptisms, etc., - simply illustrate in a general way the proposal to proceed to the exposition of the doctrine of Christ's priesthood. The illustrative proposition is that a building is not completed by lingering at the foundation; and so Christian maturity is not to be attained by going back to subjects which belong to the earliest stage of Christian instruction. He purposely selects for his illustration things which belong to the very initiation of Christian life.
 </p><p>Dead works (νεκρῶν ἔργων)
 </p><p>The phrase only in Hebrews. Comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#014">Heb 9:14</a>. Not sinful works in the ordinary sense of the term, but works without the element of life which comes through faith in the living God. There is a sharp opposition, therefore, between dead works and faith. They are contraries. This truth must be one of the very first things expounded to a Jew embracing Christianity. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#002">Hebrews 6:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">heb 6:2</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Doctrine of baptisms (βαπτισμῶν διδαχὴν)
 </p><p>Not laying again as a foundation the teaching (διδαχὴν) of baptisms. βαπτισμός only here, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#010">Heb 9:10</a>, and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#004">Mar 7:4</a>. The common form is βάπτισμα. Neither word in lxx or Class. The meaning here is lustral rites in general, and may include the baptism of John and Christian baptism. The teaching would cover all such rites, their relations and comparative significance, and it would be necessary in the case of a Jewish convert to Christianity who might not perceive, for example, any difference between Jewish lustrations and Christian baptism.
 </p><p>Laying on of hands
 </p><p>See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#014">Ti1 4:14</a>. A Jewish and a Christian practice.
 </p><p>Resurrection - eternal judgment
 </p><p>Both resurrection and future judgment were Jewish tenets requiring exposition to Jewish converts as regarded their relations to the same doctrines as taught by Christianity. The resurrection of Christ as involving the resurrection of believers would, of itself, change the whole aspect of the doctrine of resurrection as held by a Jew. Ἀιωνίου eternal certainly cannot here signify everlasting. It expresses rather a judgment which shall transcend all temporal judgments; which shall be conducted on principles different from those of earthly tribunals, and the decisions of which shall be according to the standards of the economy of a world beyond time. See additional note on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#009">Th2 1:9</a>. The phrase eternal judgment N.T.o. Comp. κρίμα τὸ μέλλον the judgment to come, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#025">Act 24:25</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#003">Hebrews 6:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">heb 6:3</a></font></span></p>
 <p>If God permit (ἐάνπερ ἐπιτρέπῃ ὁ θεός)
 </p><p>The exact formula N.T.o. Comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#007">Co1 16:7</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#021">Act 18:21</a>. Pagan parallels are τῶν θεῶν θελόντων if the gods will; θεῶν ἐπιτρεπόντων the gods permitting, and θεῶν βουλομένων if the gods desire. An ominous hint is conveyed that the spiritual dullness of the readers may prevent the writer from developing his theme and them from receiving his higher instruction. The issue is dependent on the power which God may impart to his teaching, but his efforts may be thwarted by the impossibility of repentance on their part. No such impossibility is imposed by God, but it may reside in a moral condition which precludes the efficient action of the agencies which work for repentance, so that God cannot permit the desired consequence to follow the word of teaching.

 <p>Impossible (ἀδύνατον)
 </p><p>It is impossible to dilute this word into difficult.
 </p><p>Those who were once enlightened (τοὺς ἅπαξ φωτισθέντας)
 </p><p>Rend. "once for all enlightened." Ἅπαξ is frequent in the Epistle. Comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#007">Heb 9:7</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#026">Heb 9:26</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#027">Heb 9:27</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#028">Heb 9:28</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#002">Heb 10:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#026">Heb 12:26</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#027">Heb 12:27</a>. Indicating that the enlightenment ought to have sufficed to prevent them from falling away; not that it does not admit of repetition. Enlightened, through the revelation of God in Christ, the true light, and through the power of the Spirit. Φωτίζειν in lxx usually to teach or instruct; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#130">Psa 119:130</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#002">Kg2 12:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#027">Kg2 17:27</a>. Comp. in N.T. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009">Joh 1:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#018">Eph 1:18</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#009">Eph 3:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#032">Heb 10:32</a>. Erasmus gives the correct explanation: "Who once for all have left the darkness of their former life, having been enlightened by the gospel teaching." There is no ground for explaining the word here of baptism, although the fathers from the time of Justin Martyr used φωτίζειν and φωτοσμός in that sense, and this usage continued down to the Reformation. See Just. Mart. Apol. i. 62. Chrysostom entitled his 59th Homily, addressed to candidates for baptism, πρὸς τοὺς μέλλοντας φωτίζεσθαι to those who are about to be enlightened; and justified this name for baptism by this passage and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#032">Heb 10:32</a>. The Peshitto translates this passage, "who have once (for all) descended to baptism." The N.T. gives no example of this usage.
 </p><p>Tasted of the heavenly gift (γευσαμένους τῆς δωρεᾶς τῆς ἐπουρανίου)
 </p><p>For γευσαμένους tasted, comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#009">Heb 2:9</a>. The meaning is, have consciously partaken of. Comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#003">Pe1 2:3</a>, and τρώγων eateth, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#056">Joh 6:56</a>. The heavenly gift is the Holy Spirit. It is true that this is distinctly specified in the next clause, but the two clauses belong together.
 </p><p>Partakers of the Holy Ghost (μετόχους πνεύματος ἁγίου)
 </p><p>"Heavenly gift" emphasizes the heavenly quality of the gift. The Holy Ghost is the gift itself which possesses the heavenly quality.

 <p>The good word of God (καλὸν θεοῦ ῥῆμα)
 </p><p>The gospel of Christ as preached. Comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#003">Heb 2:3</a>. To the word are attached life (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#020">Act 5:20</a>); spirit and life (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#063">Joh 6:63</a>); salvation (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#014">Act 11:14</a>); cleansing (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#026">Eph 5:26</a>); especially the impartation of the Spirit (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#034">Joh 3:34</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#032">Act 5:32</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#044">Act 10:44</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#017">Eph 6:17</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#004">Heb 2:4</a>).
 </p><p>Powers of the world to come (δυνάμεις μέλλοντος αἰῶνος)
 </p><p>Not foretastes of heavenly bliss. The world to come is the world of men under the new order which is to enter with the fulfillment of Christ's work. See on these last days, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002">Heb 1:2</a>. These powers are characteristic of that period, and in so far as that dispensation is inaugurated here and now, they assert and manifest themselves.

 </p><p>Seeing they crucify to themselves - afresh (ἀνασταυροῦντας ἑαυτοῖς)
 </p><p>In the Roman classical use of the word, ἀνά has only the meaning up: to nail up on the cross. Here in the sense of anew, an idea for which classical writers had no occasion in connection with crucifying. Εαυτοῖς for themselves. So that Christ is no more available for them. They declare that Christ's crucifixion has not the meaning or the virtue which they formerly attached to it.
 </p><p>The Son of God
 </p><p>Marking the enormity of the offense.

 </p><p>N.T.o. Rarely in lxx. Comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#004">Num 25:4</a>, hang them up. From παρὰ beside, δεικνύναι to show or point out. To put something alongside of a thing by way of commending it to imitation or avoidance. To make an example of; thence to expose to public disgrace. Δεῖγμα example, only <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#007">Jde 1:7</a>. Δειγματίζειν to make a public show or example, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#019">Mat 1:19</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#015">Col 2:15</a>.

 </p><p>
 </p><p>Additional Note on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#004">Heb 6:4-6</a>.
 </p><p>The passage has created much discussion and much distress, as appearing to teach the impossibility of restoration after a moral and spiritual lapse. It is to be observed:
 </p><p>(1) That the case stated is that of persons who once knew, loved, and believed Christian truth, and who experienced the saving, animating, and enlightening energy of the Holy Spirit, and who lapsed into indifference and unbelief.
 </p><p>(2) The questions whether it is possible for those who have once experienced the power of the gospel to fall away and be lost, and whether, supposing a lapse possible, those who fall away can ever be restored by repentance - do not belong here. The possibility of a fall is clearly assumed.
 </p><p>(3) The sin in the case supposed is the relinquishment of the spiritual gifts and powers accompanying faith in Christ, and rejecting Christ himself.
 </p><p>(4) The significance of this sin lies in the mental and spiritual condition which it betrays. It is the recoil of conviction from Christ and the adoption of the contrary conviction.
 </p><p>(5) The writer does not touch the question of the possibility of God's renewing such to repentance. He merely puts his own hypothetical case, and says that, in the nature of such a case, the ordinary considerations and means which are applied to induce men to embrace the gospel no longer appeal to the subjects supposed. He contemplates nothing beyond such agencies, and asserts that these are powerless because the man has brought himself into a condition where they can no longer exert any power. Whether God will ever reclaim by ways of his own is a point which is not even touched. Destruction of the faculty of spiritual discernment is the natural outcome of deliberate and persistent sin, and the instrument of its punishment. Note, "renew unto repentance." God promises pardon on penitence, but not penitence on sin. See a powerful passage in Coleridge's Moral and Religious Aphorisms, Amer. ed., Vol. I., p. 191.

 <p>But that which beareth thorns and briers (ἐκφέρουσα δὲ ἀκάνθας καὶ τριβόλους)
 </p><p>Wrong. As given in A.V. the illustration throws no light on the subject. It puts the contrast as between two kinds of soil, the one well-watered and fertile, the other unwatered and sterile. This would illustrate the contrast between those who have and those who have not enjoyed gospel privileges. On the contrary the contrast is between two classes of Christians under equally favorable conditions, out of which they develop opposite results. Rend. but if it (the ground that receives the rain) bear thorns and thistles, etc. Ἄκανθαι thorns, from ἀκή a point. Τρίβολος, from τρεῖς three and βέλος a dart; having three darts or points. A ball with sharp iron spikes, on three of which it rested, while the fourth projected upward, was called tribulus or tribolus, or caltrop. These were scattered over the ground by Roman soldiers in order to impede the enemy's cavalry. A kind of thorn or thistle, a land-caltrop, was called tribulus. So Virgil,

 </p><p>That accompany salvation (ἐχόμενα σωτηρίας)
 </p><p>Ἔχεσθαι with a genitive is a common Greek idiom meaning to hold one's self to a person or thing; hence to be closely joined to it. So in a local sense, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#038">Mar 1:38</a>; in a temporal sense, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#033">Luk 13:33</a>, next.

 </p><p>Which ye have shewed toward his name (ἧς ἐνεδείξασθε εἰς τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ)
 </p><p>The verb means, strictly, to show something in one's self; or to show one's self in something. similar praise is bestowed in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#032">Heb 10:32</a>. They have shown both love and work toward God's name. That does not look like crucifying Christ. God is not unjust, as he would show himself to be if he were forgetful of this.

 <p>Illustration of the long-suffering of faith by the example of Abraham. The necessity for emphasizing this element of faith lay in the growing discouragement of the Jewish Christians at the long delay of Christ's second coming. Comp. ch. 11. Abraham became a sojourner in the land of the promise, looking for the heavenly city (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#009">Heb 11:9</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#010">Heb 11:10</a>). All the instances cited in that chapter illustrate the long outlook of faith, involving patient waiting and endurance. The example of Abraham shows, first, that the promise of God is sure.

 </p><p>The compounded preposition ἐπὶ has the force of upon: to light or hit upon. The verb indicates that Abraham did not personally receive the entire fulfillment of the promise, but only the germ of its fulfillment. It was partially fulfilled in the birth of Isaac.

 <p>And an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife (καὶ πἁσης αὐτοῖς ἀντιλογίασπέρας εἰς βεβαίων ὁ ὅρκος)
 </p><p>For "an oath," rend. "the oath": generic. Const. for confirmation with end. "The oath is final for confirmation." Πέρας is the outermost point; the point beyond which one cannot go. With this exception always in N.T. in the plural, of the ends of the earth. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#042">Mat 12:42</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#018">Rom 10:18</a>.

 </p><p>Strong consolation (ἰσχυρὰν παράκλησιν)
 </p><p>Ἰσχιρὸς strong implies indwelling strength embodied or put forth either aggressively or as an obstacle to resistance; as an army or a fortress. For consolation rend. encouragement, and see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#024">Luk 6:24</a>; see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#003">Co1 14:3</a>.
 </p><p>Who have fled for refuge (οἱ καταφυγόντες)
 </p><p>Only here and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#006">Act 14:6</a>. The compound verb is well rendered by A.V., since, as distinguished from the simple φεύγειν to flee, it expresses flight to a definite place or person for safety. Hence often used in connection with an altar or a sanctuary. The distinction between the simple and the compound verb is illustrated in Hdt. iv. 23, where, speaking of the barbarous tribe of the Iyrcae, he says, "Whoever flees (φεύγων) and betakes himself for refuge (καταφύγῃ) to them, receives wrong from no one." So Xen., Hellen. 1, 6, 16: "Conon fled (ἔφευγε) in swift vessels, and betakes himself for refuge (καταφεύγει) to Mitylene."
 </p><p>To lay hold upon the hope set before us (κρατῆσαι τῆς προκειμένης)

Προκειμένης lying before or set before; destined or appointed. Mostly in Hebrews.

 <p>An anchor of the soul (ἄγκυραν τῆς ψυχῆς)
 </p><p>The same figure is implied <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#019">Ti1 1:19</a>.
 </p><p>Sure and steadfast (ἀσφαλῆ τε καὶ βεβαίαν)
 </p><p>The distinction between the two adjectives expresses the relation of the same object to different tests applied from without. Ἀσφαλῆ, not, σφάλλειν to make totter, and so to baffle or foil. Hence, secure against all attempts to break the hold. Βεβαίαν sustaining one's steps in going (βαίνεν to go): not breaking down under what steps upon it.
 </p><p>Which entereth into that within the veil (εἰσερχομένην εἰς τὸ ἐσώτερον τοῦ καταπετάσματος)
 </p><p>Const. the participle εἰσερχομένην entering with anchor. Ἐσώτερον only here and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#024">Act 16:24</a>. Comparative, of something farther within. So ἐσωτέραν φυλακήν "the inner prison," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#024">Act 16:24</a>. Καταπέτασμα veil, oClass. Commonly in N.T. of the veil of the temple or tabernacle. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#051">Mat 27:51</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#003">Heb 9:3</a>. That within the veil is the unseen, eternal reality of the heavenly world. Two figures are combined: (a) the world a sea; the soul a ship; the hidden bottom of the deep the hidden reality of the heavenly world. (b) The present life the forecourt of the temple; the future blessedness the shrine within the veil. The soul, as a tempest-tossed ship, is held by the anchor: the soul in the outer court of the temple is fastened by faith to the blessed reality within the shrine.

 <p>Whither the forerunner is for us entered (ὅπου πρόδρομος ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν ιἐσῆλθεν)
 </p><p>Ὅπου, strictly where, instead of ὄποι whither (not in N.T.), but more significant as indicating an abiding there. Πρόδρομος forerunner, N.T.o. It expresses an entirely new idea, lying completely outside of the Levitical system. The Levitical high priest did not enter the sanctuary as a forerunner, but only as the people's representative. He entered a place into which none might follow him; in the people's stead, and not as their pioneer. The peculiarity of the new economy is that Christ as high priest goes nowhere where his people cannot follow him. He introduces man into full fellowship with God. The A.V. entirely misses this point by rendering "the forerunner," as if the idea of a high priest being a forerunner were perfectly familiar. Rend. whither as a forerunner Jesus entered. Comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#019">Heb 10:19</a>.
 </p><p>Made a high priest (ἀρχιερεὺς γενόμενος)
 </p><p>Rend. having become a high priest, etc. Become, because his office must be inaugurated by his suffering human life and his death.
