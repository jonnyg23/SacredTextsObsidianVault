 <p>The arrangement of the verse is much disputed. Rend. "The law, with the same sacrifices which they continually renew year by year, can never make the comers thereunto perfect."
 </p><p>A shadow (σκιὰν)
 </p><p>The emphasis is on this thought. The legal system was a shadow. Σκιὰ is a rude outline, an adumbration, contrasted with εἰκὼν, the archetypal or ideal pattern. Σκιὰ does not accurately exhibit the figure itself. Comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#005">Heb 8:5</a>.
 </p><p>Of good things to come (τῶν μελλόντων ἀγαθῶν)
 </p><p>From the point of view of the law.
 </p><p>The very image of the things (αὐτὴν τὴν εἰκόνα τῶν πραγμάτων)
 </p><p>For εἰκὼν image, see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#014">Rev 13:14</a>; see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007">Phi 2:7</a>. Πραγμάτων things expresses a little more distinctly than μελλόντων the idea of facts and realities.
 </p><p>Can (δύναται)
 </p><p>Δύναται might be expected with ὁ νόμος the law as the subject. If δύναται, the plural, is retained, the clause the law - image of the things must be taken absolutely, the construction of the sentence breaking off suddenly, and the subject being changed from the law to the priests: "The priests can never," etc. It is better to read δύναται in the singular, with Tischendorf, Westcott and Hort, and Weiss.
 </p><p>Continually (εἰς τὸ διηνεκὲς)
 </p><p>See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#003">Heb 7:3</a>, and comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#012">Heb 10:12</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#014">Heb 10:14</a>. Const. with offer.

 <p>A remembrance of sins (ἀνάμνησις ἁμαρτιῶν)
 </p><p>Each successive sacrifice was a fresh reminder of sins to be atoned for; so far were the sacrifices from satisfying the conscience of the worshipper. Ἀνάμνησις, lit. a calling to mind.

 <p>Confirming the assertion of <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#004">Heb 10:4</a> by a citation, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007">Psa 40:7-9</a>, the theme of which is that deliverance from sin is not obtained by animal sacrifices, but by fulfilling God's will. The quotation does not agree with either the Hebrew or the lxx, and the Hebrew and lxx do not agree. The writer supposes the words to be spoken by Messiah when he enters the world as Savior. The obedience to the divine will, which the Psalmist contrasts with sacrifices, our writer makes to consist in Christ's offering once for all. According to him, the course of thought in the Psalm is as follows: "Thou, O God, desirest not the sacrifice of beasts, but thou hast prepared my body as a single sacrifice, and so I come to do thy will, as was predicted of me, by the sacrifice of myself." Christ did not yield to God's will as authoritative constraint. The constraint lay in his own eternal spirit. His sacrifice was no less his own will than God's will.

 </p><p>We are sanctified (ἡγιασμένοι)
 </p><p>Lit. we are having been sanctified; that is, in a sanctified state, as having become partakers of the spirit of Christ. This is the work of the eternal spirit, whose will is the very will of God. It draws men into its own sphere, and makes them partakers of its holiness (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#010">Heb 12:10</a>).
 </p><p>Once for all (ἐφάπαξ)
 </p><p>Const. with are sanctified. The sanctification of the Levitical offerings was only temporary, and had to be repeated. Christ's one offering "perfected forever them that are sanctified" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#014">Heb 10:14</a>). This thought is elaborated in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#011">Heb 10:11-14</a>.

 </p><p>Only here in connection with sin. See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#016">Co2 3:16</a>. The verb literally means to strip off all round.

 <p>Forever (εἰς τὸ διηνεκὲς)
 </p><p>Const. with offered. The reason appears in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#014">Heb 10:14</a>. It is according to the usage of the epistle to place this phrase after that which it qualifies. Thus one sacrifice forever is contrasted with the same sacrifices often. This agrees also with what follows. He offered one sacrifice forever, and then sat down, awaiting its eternal result.

 </p><p>Note the continued emphasis upon the τελείωσιςperfection. Comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#011">Heb 7:11</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#019">Heb 7:19</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#009">Heb 9:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#001">Heb 10:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#002">Heb 12:2</a>. No more sacrifices are needed. The reign of the Great High Priest is not to be interrupted by the duty of sacrifice.

 <p>Repetition of the passage already cited from Jeremiah in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#010">Heb 8:10-12</a>. The nerve of the citation is <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#017">Heb 10:17</a>.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">heb 10:18</a></font></span></p>
 <p>There is no more offering for sin. Forgiveness of sin is the characteristic of the new covenant. In Jeremiah complete pardon of sins is promised. If the pardon is complete, there is left no place for the Levitical sacrifices under the new covenant. At this point the doctrinal portion of the epistle ends.

 <p>By a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us (ἣν ἐνεκαίνισεν ἡμῖν ὁδὸν πρόσφατον καὶ ζῶσαν)
 </p><p>The A.V. is wrong. Ἣν which is to be construed with εἴσοδον entrance. Thus: "having boldness for the entrance which he has inaugurated (or opened) for us - a way new and living." For ἐνεκαίνισεν see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#018">Heb 9:18</a>. The way must be opened, for every other way is closed. Ἐνκαινίζειν in lxx of the inauguration of a house, kingdom, temple, altar. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#005">Deu 20:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#014">Sa1 11:14</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#063">Kg1 8:63</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#008">Ch2 15:8</a>. Πρόσφατον new, N.T.o. In lxx, see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#003">Num 6:3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#017">Deu 32:17</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#009">Psa 80:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#009">Ecc 1:9</a>. The derivation appears to be πρὸς near to, and φατός slain (from πέμφαμαι, the perfect of φένειν to kill). According to this the original sense would be newly-slain; and the word was used of one so recently dead as to retain the appearance of life: also, generally, of things which have not lost their character or appearance by the lapse of time; of fishes, fruits, oil, etc., which are fresh; of anger which has not had time to cool. Later the meaning was weakened into new. Note that the contrast is not between a new and an old way, but between a new way and no way. So long as the old division of the tabernacle existed, the way into the holiest was not opened, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#008">Heb 9:8</a>. Ζῶσαν living. A living way seems a strange expression, but comp. Peter's living stones, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005">Pe1 2:5</a>. Christ styles himself both way and life. The bold figure answers to the fact. The new way is through a life to life.
 </p><p>Through the veil (διὰ τοῦ καταπετάσματος)
 </p><p>The veil of the holy of holies is rent. Christ's work does not stop short of the believer's complete access to God himself.
 </p><p>That is to say his flesh (τοῦτ' ἔστιν τῆς σαρκὸς αὐτοῦ)
 </p><p>Const. with veil: the veil which consisted in his flesh. His flesh was the state through which he had to pass before he entered heaven for us. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#009">Heb 2:9-18</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#007">Heb 5:7-9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005">Heb 10:5</a>. When he put off that state, the veil of the temple was rent. He passed through humanity to glory as the forerunner of his people, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#020">Heb 6:20</a>.

 <p>Let us draw near (προσερχώμεθα)
 </p><p>See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#016">Heb 4:16</a>.
 </p><p>With a true heart (μετὰ ἀληθινῆς καρδίας)
 </p><p>A right and genuine inward attitude toward God. For the phrase comp. lxx, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#003">Isa 38:3</a>. N.T.o. For ἀληθινῆς see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009">Joh 1:9</a>, and comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#002">Heb 8:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#024">Heb 9:24</a>. A true heart is required to enter the true sanctuary. The phrase means more than in sincerity. Sincerity is included, but with it all that enters into a right attitude toward God as revealed in our Great High Priest, - gladness, freedom, enthusiasm, bold appropriation of all the privileges of sonship.
 </p><p>In full assurance of faith (ἐν πληροφορίᾳ πίστεως)
 </p><p>Full conviction engendered by faith. See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#011">Heb 6:11</a>. Faith is the basis of all right relation to God.
 </p><p>Sprinkled from an evil conscience (ῥεραντισμένοι - ἀπὸ συνειδήσεως πονηρᾶς)
 </p><p>This qualification for a right approach to God is stated typologically. As the priests were sprinkled with the sacrificial blood and washed with water before ministering, so do you who have now the privilege and standing of priests in approaching God, draw near, priestlike, as sharers in an economy which purges the conscience (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#014">Heb 9:14</a>), having your consciences purged. Your own hearts must experience the effects of the great sacrifice of Christ, - pardon, moral renewal, deliverance from a legal spirit. On the priesthood of believers see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005">Pe1 2:5</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009">Pe1 2:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#006">Exo 19:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#006">Isa 61:6</a>. This idea is dominated in our epistle by that of Christ's priesthood; but it is not excluded, and is implied throughout. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#015">Heb 13:15</a>. For sprinkled, see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#002">Pe1 1:2</a>.
 </p><p>Bodies washed (λελουσμένοι τὸ σῶμα)
 </p><p>Also typological. Most, expositors refer to baptism. The most significant passage in that direction is <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#021">Pe1 3:21</a>; comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#026">Eph 5:26</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#005">Tit 3:5</a>. It may be, though I doubt if the idea is emphasized. I incline, with Dr. Bruce, to think that it indicates generally the thoroughness of the cleansing process undergone by one who surrenders himself, soul, body, and spirit, to God.

 <p>Profession of our faith (τὴν ὁμολογίαν τῆς ἐλπίδος)
 </p><p>Rend. "confession of our hope." Faith does not appear among Ms. readings. It is an innovation of the translators. Hope is the rendering of Tyndale, Coverdale, the Great Bible, the Geneva, the Bishops', and Rheims. On confession see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#013">Co2 9:13</a>, and comp. notes on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#012">Ti1 6:12</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#013">Ti1 6:13</a>.

 </p><p>Take careful note of each other's spiritual welfare. For the verb see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#023">Jam 1:23</a>. It denotes attentive, continuous care. Comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#001">Heb 3:1</a>.
 </p><p>To provoke (εἰς παροξυσμὸν)
 </p><p>Lit. with a view to incitement. Only here and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#039">Act 15:39</a>. From παροξύνειν to sharpen. Hence to stimulate. In <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#039">Act 15:39</a>, the result of provocation; irritation or contention. Here the act of incitement. Twice in lxx, Deuteronomy 29:28 (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#027">Deu 29:27</a>); Jeremiah 39:3, 7 (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#003">Jer 32:3</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#007">Jer 32:7</a>); for the Hebrew קֶצֶף anger, wrath, altercation. The Hebrew derivation is from קָצַֽף a splinter. The new economy demands mutual care on the part of the members of the Christian community. Comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#025">Co1 12:25</a>. They must stir up each other's religious affections and ministries.

 <p>The assembling of ourselves together (ἐπισυναφωγὴν ἑαυτῶν)
 </p><p>Επισυναγωγή only here and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#001">Th2 2:1</a>, see note. The act of assembling, although some explain assembly. The antithesis is, "not forsaking assembling, but exhorting in assembly." Lnemann aptly says that the idea of apostasy which would be conveyed by the rendering assembly or congregation is excluded by ἔθος habit or custom, which implies an often recurring act on the part of the same persons.
 </p><p>As the manner of some is (καθὼς ἔθος τισίν)
 </p><p>For manner rend. custom. Lit. as is custom unto some. Ἔθος mostly in Luke and Acts. Comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#009">Luk 1:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#040">Joh 19:40</a>.
 </p><p>Ye see the day approaching (βλέπετε ἐγγίζουσαν τὴν ἡμέραν)
 </p><p>The day of Christ's second coming, bringing with it the judgment of Israel. He could say "ye see," because they were familiar with Christ's prophecy concerning the destruction of the temple; and they would see this crisis approaching in the disturbances which heralded the Jewish war.

 <p>We sin willfully (ἑκουσίως ἁμαρτανόντων ἡμῶν)
 </p><p>Ἑκουσίως willfully, only here and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#002">Pe1 5:2</a>. Comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#014">Plm 1:14</a>, κατ' ἑκούσιον of free will. See lxx, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#003">Num 15:3</a>. The willful sin is the abandonment of Christianity for Judaism.
 </p><p>The knowledge (ἐπίγνωσιν)
 </p><p>Only here in Hebrews. Very common in Paul. For the word, and the phrase knowledge of the truth, see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#004">Ti1 2:4</a>. The truth is the revelation through Christ.
 </p><p>There remaineth no more sacrifice for sins (οὐκέτι περὶ ἁμαρτιῶν ἀπολείπεται θυσία)
 </p><p>Of course not. For the Levitical sacrifices are abolished. It is Christ's sacrifice or none.

 <p>But a certain fearful looking for (φοβερὰ δέ τις ἐκδοχὴ)
 </p><p>Rend. "a kind of fearful expectation." Ἐκδοχὴ N.T.o, olxx.
 </p><p>Fiery indignation (πυρὸς ζῆλος)
 </p><p>For ζῆλος see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#014">Jam 3:14</a>. The radical idea of the word is ferment of spirit (ζεῖν to boil; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#025">Act 18:25</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#011">Rom 12:11</a>). This idea takes on different aspects in ζῆλος, as indignation, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#017">Act 5:17</a>; zeal, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#017">Joh 2:17</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#002">Rom 10:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#007">Co2 7:7</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#002">Co2 11:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#006">Phi 3:6</a>; envy, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#013">Rom 13:13</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#003">Co1 3:3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#020">Gal 5:20</a>. In the last sense often with ἔπις strife. The phrase fiery indignation, lit. indignation of fire (N.T.o) is an adaptation from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#011">Isa 26:11</a>.

 <p>He that despised (ἀφετήσας τις)
 </p><p>Lit. one that despised; any transgressor. The verb only here in Hebrews. The kindred noun ἀθέτησις only in Hebrews. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#018">Heb 7:18</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#026">Heb 9:26</a>.

 </p><p>The phrase N.T.o. For the noun see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#003">Co2 1:3</a>.
 </p><p>Under two or three witnesses (ἐπὶ δυσὶν ἢ τρισὶν μάρτυσιν)
 </p><p>As in lxx, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#006">Deu 17:6</a>. Ἐπὶ with dative signifying on condition of two or three witnesses testifying. Comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#017">Ti1 5:17</a>, where the same phrase occurs with the genitive, before, in the presence of. Comp. also <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#015">Deu 19:15</a>.

 <p>Of how much (πόσῳ)
 </p><p>Not qualifying χείρονος sorer, but the whole clause: "by how much think ye shall he be thought worthy of sorer punishment."
 </p><p>Punishment (τιμωρίας)
 </p><p>N.T.o. Occasionally in lxx, frequent in Class. Originally assistance; assistance to one who has been wronged; punishment. With no sense of chastisement. It is purely retributive.
 </p><p>Trodden under foot (καταπατήσας)
 </p><p>Only here in Hebrews. oP. Frequent in lxx for spoiling, defeating, treating contemptuously. The strong term is purposely selected in order to convey the sense of the fearful outrage involved in forsaking Christ and returning to Judaism.
 </p><p>Hath counted an unholy thing (κοινὸν ἡγησάμενος)
 </p><p>Ἡγεῖσθαι to count or deem means a conscious judgment resting on a deliberate weighing of the facts. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#010">Rom 12:10</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#003">Phi 2:3</a>. Here it implies a deliberate, contemptuous rejection of the gifts of the new covenant. The fundamental idea of κοινὸς is shared by all, public. Thus <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#044">Act 2:44</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#032">Act 4:32</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#004">Tit 1:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#003">Jde 1:3</a>. Out of this grows the idea of not sacred; not set apart for particular uses by purification, and so (ceremonially) unclean or defiled, as <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#002">Mar 7:2</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#005">Mar 7:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#014">Act 10:14</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#028">Act 10:28</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#008">Act 11:8</a>. In these cases it is not implied that the thing is defiled or filthy in itself, but only unclean through the absence of that which would set it apart. Comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#014">Rom 14:14</a>. Here the word admits of two explanations: (1) that Christ's blood was counted common, having no more sacred character or specific worth than the blood of any ordinary person; (2) that in refusing to regard Christ's blood as that of an atoner and redeemer, it was implied that his blood was unclean as being that of a transgressor. The former seems preferable. There was no specific virtue in Christ's blood as blood; but a peculiar and unique virtue attached to it as the offering of his eternal spirit (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#014">Heb 9:14</a>), as the blood shed in ratification of a sacred covenant established by God, and as having sanctifying virtue. This view is further justified by the combination of blood and spirit, as sources of sanctification allied in the writer's mind.
 </p><p>Hath done despite unto the spirit of grace (καὶ τὸ πνεῦμα τῆς χάριτος ἐνυβρίσας)
 </p><p>Ἐνυβρίζειν to insult, N.T.o. The simple verb ὑβρίζειν in Matthew, Luke, Acts, and Pastorals. It will be observed that the work of the Holy Spirit does not receive in this epistle the emphasis which marks it in some other portions of the N.T.

 </p><p>Rend. by becoming partakers. More than companionship is implied. For κοινωνοὶ see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#010">Luk 5:10</a>. The noun and its kindred verb in N.T. almost exclusively of ethical and spiritual relations, as <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#022">Ti1 5:22</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#013">Pe1 4:13</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#011">Jo2 1:11</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#018">Co1 10:18</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#007">Co2 1:7</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#017">Plm 1:17</a>.

 </p><p>Entirely wrong, following T.R. τοῖς δεσμοῖς μου. Rend. "ye had compassion on the prisoners." So Vulg. vinctis compassi estis. The corrupt reading has furnished one of the stock arguments for the Pauline authorship of the Epistle.
 </p><p>Took joyfully (μετὰ χαρᾶς προσεδέξασθε)
 </p><p>The verb primarily to receive to one's self, accept, as here. Comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#002">Luk 15:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#029">Phi 2:29</a>. Mostly, in N.T. however, to wait for, expect, as <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#043">Mar 15:43</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#025">Luk 2:25</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#038">Luk 2:38</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#021">Act 23:21</a>.

 </p><p>Of your goods (τῶν ὑπαρχόντων ὑμῶν)
 </p><p>The verb ὑπάρχεινmeans originally to begin, or begin to be; hence of anything that has begun to be, to come forth, be there; then simply to be. Accordingly the phrase ὑπάρχει μοὶ τι means there is something to me, I have something. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#006">Act 3:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#037">Act 4:37</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#007">Act 28:7</a>.

 <p>A little while (μικρὸν ὅσον ὅσον)
 </p><p>Strictly, a very little while. The phrase N.T.o. It is not part of the quotation, but is taken from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#020">Isa 26:20</a>, the only instance. See Aristoph. Wasps, 213.
 </p><p>He that shall come will come (ὁ ἐρχόμενος ἥξει)
 </p><p>Rend. "he that cometh will come." In the Hebrew (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#003">Hab 2:3</a>) the subject of the sentence is the vision of the extermination of the Chaldees. "The vision - will surely come." As rendered in the lxx, either Jehovah or Messiah must be the subject. The passage was referred to Messiah by the later Jewish theologians, and is so taken by our writer, as is shown by the article before ἐρχόμενος.
