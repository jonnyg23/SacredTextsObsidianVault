 <p>Book Introduction - Ezekiel
 </p><p>Ezekiel was carried away to Babylon between the first and final deportation of Judah (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#011">Kg2 24:11-16</a>). Like Daniel and the Apostle John, he prophesied out of the land, and his prophecy, like theirs, follows the method of symbol and vision. Unlike the pre-exilic prophets, whose ministry was primarily to either Judah or the ten-tribe kingdom, Ezekiel is the voice of Jehovah to "the whole house of Israel." 
 </p><p>Speaking broadly, the purpose of his ministry is to keep before the generation born in exile the national sins which had brought Israel so low (e.g. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#023">Eze 14:23</a>); to sustain the faith of the exiles by predictions of national restoration, of the execution of justice upon their oppressors, and of national glory under the Davidic monarchy. 
 </p><p>Ezekiel is in seven great prophetic strains indicated by the expression, "The hand of the Lord was upon me." (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#003">Eze 1:3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#014">Eze 3:14</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#022">Eze 3:22</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#001">Eze 8:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#022">Eze 33:22</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#001">Eze 37:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#001">Eze 40:1</a>). 
 </p><p>The minor divisions are indicated in the text. 
 </p><p>The events recorded in Ezekiel cover a period of 21 years (Ussher).
