 <p>Book Introduction - 1 Chronicles
 </p><p>The two books of Chronicles (like the two books of Kings) are but one book in the Jewish canon. Together they cover the period from the death of Saul to the captivities. They were written probably during the Babylonian captivity, and are distinguished from the two books of the Kings in a fuller account of Judah, and in the omission of many details. The blessing of God's earthly people in connection with the Davidic monarchy is probably the typical significance of these books. 
 </p><p>First Chronicles is in three parts: 
 </p><p>1. Official genealogies (1 Chronicles 1:1 - 9:44). 
 </p><p>2. From the death of Saul to the accession of David (1 Chronicles 10:1 - 12:24). 
 </p><p>3. From the accession of David to his death (1 Chronicles 13:1 - 29:30). 
 </p><p>Excluding the genealogies (Ch 1-9) the events recorded in First Chronicles cover a period of 41 years (Ussher).
