 <p>
 </p><p>This chapter contains much the same, with a little variation, as what is related in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#010">Kg1 9:10</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#001">2 Chronicles 8:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">ch2 8:1</a></font></span></p>And it came to pass at the end of twenty years,.... See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#010">Kg1 9:10</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#002">2 Chronicles 8:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">ch2 8:2</a></font></span></p>That the cities which Huram had restored to Solomon,.... Which Solomon first gave to him, but he not liking them, returned them to him, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#012">Kg1 9:12</a>, 
 <p>
 </p><p>Solomon built them; or rebuilt them, being very much out of repair, which might be one reason of Huram's not accepting them: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and caused the children of Israel to dwell there; they being inhabited by others, the remains of the Canaanitcs perhaps; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#007">Ch2 8:7</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#003">2 Chronicles 8:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">ch2 8:3</a></font></span></p>And Solomon went to Hamathzobah,.... In an hostile manner, which is the only instance of any warlike expedition of Solomon's. This was Coelesyria, which though subdued in the times of David, perhaps rebelled, and now Solomon went forth to reduce it: 
 <p>
 </p><p>and prevailed against it; took it. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#004">2 Chronicles 8:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">ch2 8:4</a></font></span></p>And built Tadmor in the wilderness,.... Of which See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#018">Kg1 9:18</a>. 
 <p>
 </p><p>and all the storehouses which he built in Hamath; a country in Syria, which he made himself master of, and where he laid up store of provision and ammunition to keep it, should any attempt be made to rescue it out of his hands. According to an Arabic writer (a), Solomon in the twenty fourth year of his reign having demolished Antioch, built seven cities, of which Tadmor was one.

 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#005">2 Chronicles 8:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">ch2 8:5</a></font></span></p>Also he built Bethhoron the upper, and Bethhoron the nether,.... Only mention is made of the latter in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#017">Kg1 9:17</a>, 
 <p>
 </p><p>fenced cities, with walls, gates, and bars; fortified cities in the tribe of Ephraim. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#006">2 Chronicles 8:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">ch2 8:6</a></font></span></p>And Baalath,.... See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#018">Kg1 9:18</a>. From hence, to the end of <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#011">Ch2 8:11</a>, it is the same with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#019">Kg1 9:19</a>. See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#019">Kg1 9:19</a>. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#020">Kg1 9:20</a>. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#021">Kg1 9:21</a>. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#022">Kg1 9:22</a>. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#023">Kg1 9:23</a>. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#024">Kg1 9:24</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#012">2 Chronicles 8:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">ch2 8:12</a></font></span></p>Then Solomon offered burnt offerings to the Lord,.... Meaning not barely at the time he rebuilt the above cities, for it was his constant practice: 
 <p>
 </p><p>on the altar of the Lord, which he had built before the porch; the brasen altar, which was at the entrance into the temple, within the court; of which see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#001">Ch2 4:1</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#013">2 Chronicles 8:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">ch2 8:13</a></font></span></p>Even after a certain rate every day, according to the commandment of Moses,.... The daily sacrifice, morning and evening, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#038">Exo 29:38</a>, 
 <p>
 </p><p>on the sabbaths, and on the new moons; when there were additional sacrifices, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#009">Num 28:9</a>, &amp;c. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and on the solemn feasts three times in the year, even in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles; which serves to explain the three times in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#025">Kg1 9:25</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#014">2 Chronicles 8:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">ch2 8:14</a></font></span></p>And he appointed, according to the order of David his father, the courses of the priests to their service,.... The twenty four courses which served weekly in their turns, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#001">Ch1 24:1</a>. 
 <p>
 </p><p>and the Levites to their charges, to praise and minister before the priests, as duty of every day required; who also had their courses by lot, to sing the praises of God, when the priests sacrificed, or blew the trumpets, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#001">Ch1 25:1</a>, 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>the porters also by their courses at every gate; from hence Dr. Lightfoot concludes that these were divided into twenty four classes, as the priests and Levite singers were: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>for so had David the man of God commanded, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#001">Ch1 26:1</a>, who in all these affairs acted as a prophet, under the inspiration and direction of the Holy Spirit of God. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#015">2 Chronicles 8:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">ch2 8:15</a></font></span></p>And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and Levites,.... The priests and Levites departed not from it, not from the commandment of Solomon, according to the order of David, but in all things obeyed it: 
 <p>
 </p><p>concerning any matter; which related to the office of either of them, sacrificers, singers, or porters: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>or concerning the treasures; such of the Levites as had the care of them were faithful to their trust, see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#020">Ch1 26:20</a>, &amp;c. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#016">2 Chronicles 8:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">ch2 8:16</a></font></span></p>Now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the foundation of the house of the Lord, and until it was finished,.... The materials were prepared, and the money for the expenses; and even the very stones and timber were made fit for the building, so that there was nothing to retard the completion of it: 
 <p>
 </p><p>so the house of God was perfected; in the space of seven years, in all the parts, and according to the form and pattern of it, see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#038">Kg1 6:38</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#017">2 Chronicles 8:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">ch2 8:17</a></font></span></p>Then went Solomon to Eziongeber,.... Being now at leisure to look after his navy, to carry on merchandise; and of this, and the following verse, and the reconciliation of them with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#026">Kg1 9:26</a>; see Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#026">Kg1 9:26</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#027">Kg1 9:27</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#028">Kg1 9:28</a>.
