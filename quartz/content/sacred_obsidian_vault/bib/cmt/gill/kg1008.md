 <p>
 </p><p>This chapter gives an account of the introduction of the ark into the temple, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#001">Kg1 8:1</a> of the glory of the Lord filling it, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#010">Kg1 8:10</a> of a speech Solomon made to the people concerning the building of the temple, and how he came to be engaged in it, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#012">Kg1 8:12</a>, of a prayer of his he put up on this occasion, requesting, that what supplications soever were made at any time, or on any account, by Israelites or strangers, might be accepted by the Lord, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#022">Kg1 8:22</a>, and of his blessing the people of Israel at the close of it, with some useful exhortations, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#054">Kg1 8:54</a>, and of the great number of sacrifices offered up by him, and the feast he made for the people, upon which he dismissed them, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#062">Kg1 8:62</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#001">3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">kg1 8:1</a></font></span></p>Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel,.... The judges in the several cities, or senators of the great sanhedrim, as others; though it is a question whether as yet there was such a court: 
 <p>
 </p><p>and all the heads of the tribes; the princes of the twelve tribes: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel; the principal men of the ancient families in every tribe: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>unto King Solomon in Jerusalem; these he summoned together to himself there where the temple was built: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the city of David, which is Zion; whither David brought it, when he had taken that fort, so called, and dwelt in it; and from this mountain Solomon proposed to bring it up to the temple, on a higher mountain, Moriah, not far from one another. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#002">3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">kg1 8:2</a></font></span></p>And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto King Solomon at the feast,.... Not of tabernacles, as the Targum on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#003">Ch2 5:3</a> and so Jarchi; though that was in the same month next mentioned, and began on the fifteenth of it, and held seven days; wherefore this must be the feast of the dedication of the temple, and which was kept before that; since both lasted fourteen days, and the people were dismissed on the twenty third of the month; now not only the above principal persons convened, but a vast number of the common people came to see the solemnity of removing the ark, and of dedicating the temple, and to attend the feast of it, and the more, since in a few days was the time for all the males in Israel to appear there: 
 <p>
 </p><p>in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month; it was, as the Targum says, originally the first month; but upon the children of Israel coming out of Egypt in Ab or Nisan, that became the first month, and this was the seventh from that; and is the same with Tisri, which answers to part of September, and part of October, here called Ethanim; which some render the month of the ancients, others of strong ones; either because of the many feasts that were in it, as some say; or because it was the time of ingathering all the increase and fruits of the earth, which strengthen and support man's life; or rather of "never failing", i.e. waters, showers falling in this month, and the rivers full of water (l); so September is "septimus imber", according to Isidore (m), and the three following months are alike derived; this, by the Egyptians, was called Theuth, and was with them the first month in the year (n); so Porphyry says (o), with the Egyptians the beginning of the year was not Aquarius, as with the Romans, but Cancer; and so the month of September was the first with the Ethiopians (p), and with most people (q); though with the Chinese about the middle of Aquarius (r). Now, though the temple was finished in the eighth month, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#038">Kg1 6:38</a>, it was not dedicated until the seventh in the following year; it required time to finish the utensils and vessels, and put them in their proper place, and for the drying of the walls, &amp;c.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">kg1 8:3</a></font></span></p>And all the elders of Israel came,.... To Zion, the city of David: 
 <p>
 </p><p>and the priests took up the ark; from thence; in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#004">Ch2 5:4</a> it is said the Levites did it, whose business it was, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#025">Deu 31:25</a>, and so the priests might be called; for every priest was a Levite, though every Levite was not a priest, and the priests did at all times bear the ark; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#015">Jos 3:15</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#004">3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">kg1 8:4</a></font></span></p>And they brought up the ark of the Lord,.... From the city of David to the temple: 
 <p>
 </p><p>and the tabernacle of the congregation; not the tent David made for the ark, though that might be brought also, but the tabernacle of Moses, which had been many years at Gibeon; but now removed to Zion, and from thence to the temple, where it was laid up, as having been a sacred thing; that it might not be put to common or superstitious uses, and to prevent the being of more places than one for worship: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle; as the candlestick, shewbread table, incense altar, &amp;c. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>even those did the priests and the Levites bring up; some brought one, and some another; the priests brought the ark, and the Levites the vessels. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#005">3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">kg1 8:5</a></font></span></p>And King Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled together,.... On this solemn occasion: 
 <p>
 </p><p>were with him before the ark; while it was in the court of the priests, before it was carried into the most holy place: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude; the phrase seems to be hyperbolical, and designed to denote a great number. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#006">3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">kg1 8:6</a></font></span></p>And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the Lord unto his place,.... Destined for it, the like to which it had in the tabernacle: 
 <p>
 </p><p>into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place; that part of the house where the divine oracle was, the holy of holies; for though into it none but the high priest might enter, and he but once a year; yet in case of necessity, as for the repair of it, which the Jews (s) gather from hence, other priests might enter, as was the case now; an high priest could not carry in the ark himself, and therefore it was necessary to employ others; and besides, as yet the divine Majesty had not taken up his residence in it: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>even under the wings of the cherubim; the large ones which Solomon had made, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#023">Kg1 6:23</a> not those of Moses. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(s) Vid. Maimon. Hilchot Beth Habechirah, c. 7. sect. 23. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#007">3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">kg1 8:7</a></font></span></p>For the cherubim spread forth their two wings over the place of the ark,.... The most holy place where the ark stood, even from wall to wall: 
 <p>
 </p><p>and the cherubim covered the ark, and the staves thereof above; so that neither could be seen. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#008">3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">kg1 8:8</a></font></span></p>And they drew out the staves,.... Not made them larger, as Ben Gersom, than those in the tabernacle of Moses, this place being larger than that; nor did they draw them wholly out, and lay them up in the sanctuary, there being no further use for them, the ark having now a fixed place, and not to be removed; which would have been contrary to <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#015">Exo 25:15</a> but they drew them out some little way: 
 <p>
 </p><p>that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before the oracle; not in that part of the temple commonly called the holy place, in distinction from the most holy, for that seems to be denied in the next clause; nor could they be seen there, since there was a wall and a vail between them; though some think they might be seen when the door was opened, and the vail turned aside; and these also pushing against the vail, might be seen prominent, like the breasts of a woman under a covering, as the Jews express it; but the sense is, that the ends of these were seen out of the ark from under the wings of the cherubim, being a little drawn, in that part of the most holy place which is before the oracle or mercy seat: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and they were not seen without; neither quite out of the ark, nor without the most holy place, nor in the holy place; but were only seen by the high priest when he went in on the day of atonement, and served as a direction to him to go between them before the ark, and there perform his work (t); which, through the darkness of the place, and the ark being covered with the wings of the cherubim, he could not otherwise discern the exact place where it stood: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and there they are unto this day: when the writer of this book lived, even in the same situation. 
 </p><p>

 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#009">3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">kg1 8:9</a></font></span></p>There was nothing in the ark, save the two tables of stone which Moses put there at Horeb,.... That is, there were no other writings; or, as Ben Gersom says, no other part of the law, but the decalogue otherwise he observes there were in it Aaron's rod and the pot of manna, according to <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#004">Heb 9:4</a> though the particle there may be rendered "at", or "with", or "by"; see Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#004">Heb 9:4</a> and so they might be not within it, but in some place on the sides of it, see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#026">Deu 31:26</a>, 
 <p>
 </p><p>when the Lord made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt; about two months after. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#010">3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">kg1 8:10</a></font></span></p>And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place,.... The most holy place, having set up the ark of the Lord there, who were all sanctified that were there, and did not wait by course as at other times, see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#011">Ch2 5:11</a>, where in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#012">Ch2 5:12</a> it is said, that at this time, the Levites, who were singers of the families of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun, arrayed in fine linen, with their musical instruments in their hands, stood at the east end of the altar of burnt offering, and one hundred and twenty priests, blowing their trumpets, praised the Lord together with one sound, declaring his goodness and his mercy, which endure for ever: and then it was 
 <p>
 </p><p>that the cloud filled the house of the Lord; the whole temple, both the holy of holies and the holy place, and the court of the priests; so that it was visible to all, and was a token of the divine presence of God, of his taking possession of his house, and of his taking up his residence in it. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#011">3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">kg1 8:11</a></font></span></p>So that the priests could not stand to minister, because of the cloud,.... Either through the darkness it first caused, or through the light that broke out of it, which was dazzling to them, or through the terror it struck their minds with; they could neither minister in the holy place, by offering incense there; and as for the most holy place, none but the high priest could minister there, and that on one day only; nor in the court of the priests, at the altar of burnt offerings: 
 <p>
 </p><p>for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord; a bright and glorious stream came forth from the cloud, and spread itself all over the house, and then took up its abode in the most holy place as in the tabernacle, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#034">Exo 40:34</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#012">3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">kg1 8:12</a></font></span></p>And then spake Solomon,.... Perceiving by this symbol that the Lord was come into his house, to take up his dwelling in it, and seeing the priests and people in consternation at it, spake the following words to their comfort: 
 <p>
 </p><p>the Lord said that he would dwell in the thick darkness; and now was fulfilling his promise, and therefore to be considered not as a token of his displeasure, but of his gracious presence; this was done for the greater awe of the divine Majesty, and to denote the darkness of the former dispensation; reference may be had to <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#002">Lev 16:2</a> or rather this was now said by the Lord, that is, it appeared to be his resolution and determination to dwell in this manner; the Targum is, 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>"the Lord is pleased to cause his Shechinah or divine Majesty to dwell in Jerusalem,'' 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>in the temple there. This was imitated by the Heathens; hence the Lacedemonians had a temple dedicated to Jupiter Scotitas, or the dark, as Pausanias (u) relates; and the Indian Pagans to this day affect darkness in their temples, and are very careful that no light enter into them but by the door, which is commonly strait and low, and by little crevices in the windows (w).

 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#013">3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">kg1 8:13</a></font></span></p>I have surely built thee an house to dwell in,.... Turning himself from the priests and people, he quieted with a few words, he addressed the Lord; having built an house for him, for his worship and glory, with this view, that he might dwell in it, he was now, by the above token, fully assured it would be an habitation for him: 
 <p>
 </p><p>a settled place for thee to abide in for ever; which is observed in distinction from the tabernacle of Moses, which was often removed from place to place, otherwise this did not continue for ever; though Solomon might hope it would, at least unto the times of the Messiah; and indeed such a building on this spot, for such use, did continue so long, excepting the interval of the seventy years' captivity in Babylon. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#014">3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">kg1 8:14</a></font></span></p>And the king turned his face about,.... He was before the altar, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#022">Kg1 8:22</a>, with his face to that first, and looking towards the holy and the most holy place, filled with the cloud and glory; and now he turned himself and stood with the altar behind him, and looking to the court of the people: 
 <p>
 </p><p>and blessed all the congregation of Israel; either blessed the Lord before them, or prayed for blessings for them, or congratulated them upon the Lord's taking up his residence in the temple, which was so great an honour and favour to them: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and all the congregation of Israel stood: ready to receive the king's blessing, and in honour of him, and reverence to the divine Being. The Jews say, none might sit in the court but the kings of the house of David. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#015">3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">kg1 8:15</a></font></span></p>And he said, blessed be the Lord God of Israel,.... All praise and glory, honour and blessing, be ascribed to the Lord; who had afresh shown himself to be Israel's covenant God, by taking up his residence among them in the temple he had filled with his glory: 
 <p>
 </p><p>which spake with his mouth to David my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled it; who graciously promised him he should have a son that should build an house for him, and which he had by his power and providence faithfully performed; or rather which spake concerning David, so Noldius (x); for God did not speak with his mouth to David, but to Nathan, of him: saying; as follows.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">kg1 8:16</a></font></span></p>Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt,.... Which was now about four hundred and eighty eight years ago; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#001">Kg1 6:1</a>. 
 <p>
 </p><p>I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build an house, that my name might be therein; he had chosen one in his mind from all eternity; but he had not made known this choice, nor the place he had chosen; he gave hints by Moses, that there was a place which he should choose, or declare he had chosen to put his name in, but did not express it, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#005">Deu 12:5</a> but now it was a clear case that he had chosen Jerusalem, and that was the city he always had in view, see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#006">Ch2 6:6</a>, 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>but I chose David to be over my people Israel; to be their king, and to him he gave the first hint of the place where the temple was to be built, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#001">Ch1 22:1</a>, and he chose no man, and his family with him, before him, to rule over Israel, and be concerned in such a work, see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#005">Ch2 6:5</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#017">3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">kg1 8:17</a></font></span></p>And it was in the heart of David my father,.... His mind was disposed to it, his heart was set upon it, he had taken up a resolution: 
 <p>
 </p><p>to build an house for the name of the Lord God of Israel; for his worship and service, for his honour and glory, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#003">Sa2 7:3</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#018">3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">kg1 8:18</a></font></span></p>And the Lord said unto David my father,.... By Nathan the prophet: 
 <p>
 </p><p>whereas it was in thine heart to build an house unto my name, thou didst well that it was in thine heart; his design was good, and so far it was acceptable to the Lord, that he thought of such a thing, though it was not his pleasure that should do it, as follows. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#019">3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">kg1 8:19</a></font></span></p>Nevertheless, thou shall not build the house,.... Which is implied in the question in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#005">Sa2 7:5</a>. 
 <p>
 </p><p>but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house unto my name; which is expressed in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#012">Sa2 7:12</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#020">3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">kg1 8:20</a></font></span></p>And the Lord hath performed his word that he spake,.... To David, concerning his son's building the temple: 
 <p>
 </p><p>and I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the Lord promised; succeeded him in the kingdom: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and have built an house for the name of the Lord God of Israel; the temple he had now finished; and thus the promise to David was punctually fulfilled, that he should have a son that should succeed him in the throne, and build the house of the Lord. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#021">3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">kg1 8:21</a></font></span></p>And I have set there a place for the ark,.... The most holy place: 
 <p>
 </p><p>wherein is the covenant of the Lord; the two tables of stone, on which were the covenant of the Lord, as the Targum: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt; as in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#009">Kg1 8:9</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#022">3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">kg1 8:22</a></font></span></p>And Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord,.... The altar of the burnt offering in the court of the priests, where he prayed the following prayer; and which altar was typical of Christ, who is always to be in sight in prayer, and through whom all sacrifices of prayer and praise become acceptable to God. In <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#013">Ch2 6:13</a> he is said to stand upon a scaffold of brass, five cubits long, five broad, and three high, which stood in the midst of the court; it was a sort of a pulpit, round, as a laver, for which the word is sometimes used, and on which he kneeled: 
 <p>
 </p><p>in the presence of all the congregation of Israel; who stood in the great court before him, called the court of Israel: 
 </p><p>

 </p><p>and repent of them, and make supplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captives; though and while they are in such a state: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>saying, we have sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed wickedness; which phrases include all their sins, with all the aggravated circumstances of them, and their sense of them, and contrition for them.

 <p>
 </p><p>"return unto thy worship;'' 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>relinquishing false worship they had given into, and serve the Lord in the best manner they could:

By returning them to their own land; by which it would appear that the Lord had forgiven their trespasses, as well as by what follows: 
 <p>
 </p><p>and give them compassion before them who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them; for it is in the power of God to work upon the affections of men, and dispose their minds to use his people well, and to pity them under their distresses, as the Chaldeans did the Jews in Babylon, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#046">Psa 106:46</a>.

By his choice of them in his own mind, by the redemption of them out of Egypt, by the peculiar laws he gave them, and by the special blessings he conferred upon them: 
 <p>
 </p><p>as thou spakest by the hand of Moses thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord our God; it was he that spake this to Moses, and by him to the people, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005">Exo 19:5</a> and it was he that did it, namely, separate them from all nations, to be his people and peculiar treasure: in this and the two preceding verses Solomon makes use of arguments taken from what the people of Israel were to the Lord, and he had done for them, to engage him to hearken to their supplications, and here ends his long prayer; in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#001">Ch2 6:1</a> some things are added at the close of it, and some omitted.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_054">kg1 8:54</a></font></span></p>And it was so, that, when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the Lord,....

 <p>

 </p><p>from kneeling on his knees; upon the brasen scaffold; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#013">Ch2 6:13</a>, in which posture he was during this long prayer: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>with his hands spread up to heaven; which gesture he had used in his prayer, and now continued in blessing the people.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_055">kg1 8:55</a></font></span></p>And he stood and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice,.... Turning himself the altar, and his face to the people, giving them his benediction, not only as the father of his people, but as preacher in Jerusalem, closing it with a word of exhortation to them: 
 <p>
 </p><p>saying: as follows.

A land of rest, and rest in the land from all enemies; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#009">Deu 12:9</a>, 
 <p>
 </p><p>there hath not failed one word of all his good promises, which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant: so Joshua observed a little before his death, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#014">Jos 23:14</a> to which Solomon seems to have respect; and who lived to see a greater accomplishment of the gracious promises of God, and his faithfulness therein, both in the times of his father David, and his own.

Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and those that came out of Egypt, and especially that entered into the land of Canaan under Joshua, and subdued it; as the Lord had been with them to guide and direct them, protect and defend them, succeed and prosper them, so Solomon desires he might be with them: nothing is more desirable than the presence of God; Solomon could not have prayed for a greater blessing for himself and his people; the Targum is, 
 <p>
 </p><p>"let the Word of the Lord our God be for our help, as he was for the help of our fathers:'' 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>let him not leave us, nor forsake us: this was no doubt a prayer of faith, founded upon a divine promise, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#005">Jos 1:5</a>.

 <p>
 </p><p>to walk in all his ways; he has prescribed and directed to:

 </p><p>and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers; all his laws, moral, ceremonial, and judicial.

 </p><p>be nigh unto the Lord our God day and night; be continually remembered and regarded by him, that so gracious answers might always be returned to those who supplicated in this place: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>that he maintain the cause of his servant; of himself and his successors in the throne, that they may continue to possess it in peace, to the glory of God, and the good of the people: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and the cause of his people Israel at all times: that their rights and privileges might be continued, and they supported in them; and both his cause and theirs be regarded:

 </p><p>as the matter shall require; as they should stand in need of assistance, direction, and protection.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_060">kg1 8:60</a></font></span></p>That all the people of the earth may know that the Lord is God,.... By chastising the people of Israel when they sinned; by bearing and answering their prayers when they prayed unto him; by forgiving their sins, and delivering them out of their troubles; by maintaining their cause, and protecting them in the enjoyment of their blessings: and that there is "none else"; no God besides him; all being else fictitious deities, or nominal ones; he only is the one living and true God.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_061">kg1 8:61</a></font></span></p>Let your heart therefore be perfect with the Lord your God,.... Sincere in their love to him, united in their worship of him, and constant in their obedience to him: 
 <p>
 </p><p>to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day: as they did that day, neither king nor people having as yet fallen into idolatry, but showing by their then present appearance a zeal for God, his house, and worship. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#062">3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:62</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_062">kg1 8:62</a></font></span></p>And the king and all Israel with him offered sacrifice before the Lord. For burnt offerings, which having been laid upon the altar, as soon as the king had done praying to God, and blessing the people, and exhorting them, fire came down from heaven, and consumed them; which showed the Lord's acceptance of the sacrifices, and was another confirmation, besides the cloud, of the Lord's well pleasedness with the temple, and of his taking possession of it to reside in it; upon which the people bowed and worshipped, and praised the Lord for his goodness and mercy, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#001">Ch2 7:1</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#063">3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:63</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_063">kg1 8:63</a></font></span></p>And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered unto the Lord,.... Part of which belonged to the offerer, and with those Solomon feasted the people all the days of the feast of the dedication, if not of tabernacles also; for the number was exceeding large, as follows: 
 <p>
 </p><p>22,000 oxen, and 120,000 sheep; which, as suggested, might be the number for all the fourteen days; nor need it seem incredible, since, as Josephus (b) says, at a passover celebrated in the times of Cestius the Roman governor, at the evening of the passover, in two hours time 256,500 lambs were slain; however, this was a very munificent sacrifice of Solomon's, in which he greatly exceeded the Heathens, whose highest number of sacrifices were hecatombs, or by hundreds, but his by thousands: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>so the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the Lord; devoted it to divine and religious worship by these sacrifices: hence in imitation of this sprung the dedication of temples with the Heathens; the first of which among the Romans was that in the capitol at Rome (c) by Romulus; the rites and ceremonies used therein by them may be read in Cicero, Livy, Tacitus, and others (d).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_064">kg1 8:64</a></font></span></p>The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of the Lord,.... The court of the priests that was before the holy place, adjoining to it, in which was the altar of burnt offering; this, or, however, the middle part of it, he sanctified for present use, to offer sacrifices on, for a reason hereafter given: 
 <p>
 </p><p>for there he offered burnt offerings and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings; which was the reason why the middle of the great court was for this time set apart for this service. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#065">3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:65</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_065">kg1 8:65</a></font></span></p>And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him,.... Partaking of the parts of the peace offerings which belonged to him, and were offered by way of thanksgiving on the occasion, together with whatsoever he might as a liberal prince provide for this entertainment: 
 <p>
 </p><p>for it was for a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt; consisting of a number of people, gathered together from Hamath, which was on the northern border of the land of Israel, to the river of Egypt; either the Nile, or Rhinoculura, a branch of it, which lay on the southern border of the land: and this was kept 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>before the Lord; as in his presence, with thankfulness to him, and with a view to his glory: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>seven days and seven days, even fourteen days; seven days for the dedication of the house, and seven days for the feast of tabernacles, as the Targum; which agrees with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#009">Ch2 7:9</a>, the feast of dedication was first, and began perhaps on the seventh day of the month, as the feast of tabernacles did on the fifteenth: within this time, namely, on the tenth, was a fast day, the day of atonement; which was either observed between the two feasts, or was omitted, which is not likely; or they did not eat and drink until the evening of that day. The Septuagint version, according to the Vatican copy, reads "seven days" only once; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#008">Ch2 7:8</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#066">3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:66</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_066">kg1 8:66</a></font></span></p>On the eighth day he sent the people away,.... That is, of the feast of tabernacles, the eighth from the first of that, which was a solemn day, and fell on the twenty second of the month; at the close of which the dismission was made, or they had leave to go, but they did not until the twenty third, according to <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#010">Ch2 7:10</a>. 
 <p>
 </p><p>and they blessed the king; returned him thanks for his care, and charge, and pains, in building the temple; for prayers for them, and the feast he had now made, and wished all health and happiness to him: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart; or to their cities, as the Targum, to their several habitations; being greatly delighted with what they had seen and heard, and partook of especially: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>for all the goodness the Lord had done for David his servant, and for Israel his people; in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#010">Ch2 7:10</a>, it is added, "unto Solomon"; for David, in giving him such a son and successor, who according to promise had built the house of the Lord; and for Solomon, in raising him up to such dignity, and enabling him to build such a temple for the worship of God and his glory; and for the people of Israel, in giving them such a king to rule over them, under whom they enjoyed so much peace and prosperity, and the full and free exercise of the true religion, with such accommodations, and in such a splendid manner as now.
