 <p>The visit of the queen of Sheba. Cf. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#001">Kg1 10:1-13</a>. - This event is narrated as a practical proof of Solomon's extraordinary wisdom. The narrative agrees so exactly in both texts, with the exception of some few quite unimportant differences, that we must regard them as literal extracts from an original document which they have used in common. For the commentary on this section, see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#001">Kg1 10:1-13</a>.

 <p>Solomon's revenue in gold, and the use he made of it. Cf. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#014">Kg1 10:14-22</a>, and the commentary there on this section, which is identical in both narratives, with the exception of some trifling differences. Before מביאים והסּחרים the relative pronoun is to be supplied: "and what the merchants brought." As to the derivation of the word פּחות, which comes from the Aramaic form פּחה, governor (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#014">Ch2 9:14</a>), see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#001">Hag 1:1</a>. - תּרשׁישׁ הלכות אניּות, in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#021">Ch2 9:21</a>, ships going to Tarshish, is an erroneous paraphrase of תּרשׁישׁ אניּות, Tarshish-ships, i.e., ships built for long sea voyages; for the fleet did not go to Tartessus in Spain, but to Ophir in Southern Arabia (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#026">Kg1 9:26</a>.). All the rest has been explained in the commentary on 1 Kings 10.

 <p>In <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#022">Ch2 9:22-28</a>, all that remained to be said of Solomon's royal glory, his riches, his wisdom, and his revenues, is in conclusion briefly summed up, as in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#023">Kg1 10:23-29</a>. From <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#025">Ch2 9:25</a> onwards, the account given in the Chronicle diverges from that in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#026">Kg1 10:26</a>., in so far that what is narrated in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#026">Kg1 10:26-28</a> concerning Solomon's chariots and horses, and his trade with Egypt in horses, is here partly replaced by statements similar in import to those in 1 Kings 5, because the former matters had been already treated of in Chr. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#014">Ch2 1:14-17</a>.

 <p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#025">Ch2 9:25</a> does not correspond to the passage <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#026">Kg1 10:26</a>, but in contents and language agrees with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#006">Kg1 5:6</a>, and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#026">Ch2 9:26</a> with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#001">Kg1 5:1</a>. Only the general estimate of Solomon's riches in gold and silver, in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#027">Ch2 9:27</a>, repeated from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#015">Ch2 1:15</a>, corresponds to <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#027">Kg1 10:27</a>. Finally, in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#028">Ch2 9:28</a> the whole description is rounded off; all that has already been said in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#016">Ch2 1:16</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#017">Ch2 1:17</a> as to the trade in horses with Egypt (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#028">Kg1 10:28-29</a>) being drawn together into one general statement.
