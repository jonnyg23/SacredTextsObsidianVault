 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001">Micah 4:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">mic 4:1</a></font></span></p>But in the (a) last days it shall come to pass, [that] the mountain of the house of the LORD shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the (b) hills; and people shall flow unto it. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) When Christ will come, and the temple will be destroyed. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002">Isa 2:2</a>  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#002">Micah 4:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">mic 4:2</a></font></span></p>And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will (c) teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) He shows that there is no true Church, except where the people are taught by God's pure word.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#003">Micah 4:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">mic 4:3</a></font></span></p>And he shall judge among many people, and (d) rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into (e) pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they (f) learn war any more. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) By his corrections and threatenings he will bring the people into subjection who are in the utmost corners of the world. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(e) They will abstain from all evil doing, and exercise themselves in godliness and in well doing to others. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(f) Read (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#004">Isa 2:4</a>)  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#005">Micah 4:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">mic 4:5</a></font></span></p>For all people will walk (g) every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and ever. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) He shows that the people of God ought to remain constant in their religion, even if all the world should give themselves to their superstition and idolatry.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#007">Micah 4:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">mic 4:7</a></font></span></p>And I will make her that halted (h) a remnant, and her that was cast far off a strong nation: and the LORD shall reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth, even for ever. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) I will cause that Israel, who is now as one lame and halting, and so almost destroyed, to live again, and grow into a great people.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#008">Micah 4:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">mic 4:8</a></font></span></p>And thou, O (i) tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, even (k) the first dominion; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) Meaning Jerusalem, where the Lord's flock was gathered. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(k) The flourishing state of the kingdom, as it was under David and Solomon, which thing was accomplished for the Church by the coming of Christ.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#009">Micah 4:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">mic 4:9</a></font></span></p>Now why dost thou cry out aloud? [is (l) there] no king in thee? is thy counsellor perished? for pangs have taken thee as a woman in travail. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) In the meantime he shows that they would endure great troubles and temptations, when they saw themselves neither to have king nor counsel.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#012">Micah 4:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">mic 4:12</a></font></span></p>But they (m) know not the thoughts of the LORD, neither understand they his counsel: for he shall gather them as the sheaves into the floor. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) He shows that the faithful ought not to measure God's judgments by the braggings and threatenings of the wicked, but by these are admonished to lift up their hearts to God to call for deliverance.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#013">Micah 4:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">mic 4:13</a></font></span></p>Arise and thresh, (n) O daughter of Zion: for I will make thine horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass: and thou shalt beat in pieces many people: and I will consecrate their gain unto the LORD, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(n) God gives his Church this victory, as often as he overcomes their enemies: but the accomplishment of this will be at the last coming of Christ.
