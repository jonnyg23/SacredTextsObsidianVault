 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Where the ten tribes contended against Judah. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) As they of Judah say. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(c) He thought by speaking contemptuously of the king, to stir the people farther to sedition, or else by causing Israel to depart, thought that they of Judah would have esteemed him less.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">sa2 20:2</a></font></span></p>So every man of Israel went up from after David, [and] followed Sheba the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah clave unto their king, from (d) Jordan even to Jerusalem.

 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#006">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 20:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">sa2 20:6</a></font></span></p>And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than [did] Absalom: take thou thy (f) lord's servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fenced cities, and escape us. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Either those who had been under Joab or David's men.

And Joab's (g) garment that he had put on was girded unto him, and upon it a girdle [with] a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Which was his coat, that he used to wear in the wars.

 <p>
 </p><p>(l) She shows that the old custom was not to destroy a city before peace was offered, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#010">Deu 20:10-11</a>). 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#019">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 20:19</a></p>

And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(n) Hearing his fault, he gave in to reason, and required only he that was instigator of the treason.
