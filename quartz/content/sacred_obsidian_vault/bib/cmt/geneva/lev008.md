 <p>
 </p><p>(a) So called, because this superscription, "holiness to the Lord" was graven in it.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#010">Leviticus 8:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">lev 8:10</a></font></span></p>And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the (b) tabernacle and all that [was] therein, and sanctified them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) That is, the holiest of holies, the sanctuary and the court.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">lev 8:15</a></font></span></p>And he slew [it]; and Moses took the blood, and put [it] upon the horns of the (c) altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified (d) it, to make reconciliation upon it. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Of the burnt offering. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(d) To offer for the sins of the people.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">lev 8:17</a></font></span></p>But the bullock, and his (e) hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt with fire without the camp; as the LORD commanded Moses. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) In other burnt offerings, which are not of consecration, or offering for himself, the priest has the skin, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#008">Lev 7:8</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">lev 8:23</a></font></span></p>And he (f) slew [it]; and Moses took of the blood of it, and put [it] upon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Moses did this because the priests were not yet established in their office.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_031">lev 8:31</a></font></span></p>And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh [at] the door of the (g) tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat it with the bread that [is] in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) At the door of the court.

 <p>
 </p><p>(h) By commission given to Moses.
