 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#001">Psalms 128:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">psa 128:1</a></font></span></p>"A Song of degrees." Blessed [is] every one that feareth the LORD; that walketh in his (a) ways. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) God approves not our life, unless it is reformed according to his word.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#002">Psalms 128:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">psa 128:2</a></font></span></p>For thou shalt eat the labour of thine (b) hands: happy [shalt] thou [be], and [it shall be] well with thee. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) The world esteems them happy who live in wealth and idleness but the Holy Spirit approves them best who live of the mean profit of their labours.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#003">Psalms 128:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">psa 128:3</a></font></span></p>Thy wife [shall be] as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house: thy (c) children like olive plants round about thy table. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Because God's favour appears in no outward thing more than in the increase of children, he promises to enrich the faithful with this gift.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#005">Psalms 128:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">psa 128:5</a></font></span></p>The LORD shall (d) bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the good of (e) Jerusalem all the days of thy life. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Because of the spiritual blessing which God has made to his Church, these temporal things will be granted. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(e) For unless God blessed his Church publicly, this private blessing was nothing.
