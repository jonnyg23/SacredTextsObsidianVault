 <p>
 </p><p>(d) They had permission to depart on the 22nd day, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#066">Kg1 8:66</a>) but they did not leave till the next day.

 <p>
 </p><p>(e) I will cause the pestilence to cease and destroy the beasts that hurt the fruit of the earth, and send rain in due season.

 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Declaring that God had more concern for their salvation than for the advancement of his own glory: and where men abuse those things which God has appointed to set forth his praise, he withdraws his graces.
