 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#001">Genesis 38:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">gen 38:1</a></font></span></p>And it came to pass at that time, that (a) Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name [was] Hirah. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Moses describes the genealogy of Judah, because the Messiah should come from him.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#002">Genesis 38:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">gen 38:2</a></font></span></p>And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name [was] Shuah; (b) and he took her, and went in unto her. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) A relationship which nonetheless was condemned by God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#008">Genesis 38:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">gen 38:8</a></font></span></p>And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and marry her, and raise (c) up seed to thy brother. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) This order was for the preservation of the stock, since the child begotten by the second brother would have the name and inheritance of the first: a practice which is abolished in the New Testament.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#011">Genesis 38:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">gen 38:11</a></font></span></p>Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, (d) Remain a widow at thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren [did]. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) For she could not marry in any other family so long as Judah would retain her in his.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#016">Genesis 38:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">gen 38:16</a></font></span></p>And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he (e) knew not that she [was] his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) God miraculously blinded him so that he could not know her by her voice.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#020">Genesis 38:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">gen 38:20</a></font></span></p>And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his (f) friend the Adullamite, to receive [his] pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) That his wickedness might not be known to others.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#023">Genesis 38:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">gen 38:23</a></font></span></p>And Judah said, Let her take [it] to her, lest we be (g) shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) He fears man more than God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#024">Genesis 38:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">gen 38:24</a></font></span></p>And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she [is] with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be (h) burnt. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) We see that the Law, which was written in man's heart, taught them that adultery should be punished with death, even though no law had been given yet.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#026">Genesis 38:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">gen 38:26</a></font></span></p>And Judah acknowledged [them], and said, She hath been (i) more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again (k) no more. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) That is, she ought rather to accuse me than I her. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(k) for the horror of the sin condemned him.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#029">Genesis 38:29</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">gen 38:29</a></font></span></p>And it came to pass, as he (l) drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How (m) hast thou broken forth? [this] breach [be] upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) Their heinous sin was signified by this monstrous birth. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(m) Or the separation between you and your brother.
