 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">jer 24:1</a></font></span></p>The LORD showed me, and, behold, two (a) baskets of figs [were] set before the temple of the LORD, after Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the craftsmen and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) The good figs signified them that were gone into captivity and so saved their life, as in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#008">Jer 21:8</a>), and the bad figs them that remained, who were yet subject to the sword, famine and pestilence.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#005">Jeremiah 24:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">jer 24:5</a></font></span></p>Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Like these good figs, so will I acknowledge them that are carried away captive of Judah, whom I have sent out of this (b) place into the land of the Chaldeans for [their] good. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) By which he approves the yielding of Jeconiah and his company because they obeyed the prophet, who exhorted them to it.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#007">Jeremiah 24:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">jer 24:7</a></font></span></p>And I will give them (c) an heart to know me, that I [am] the LORD: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: for they shall return to me with their whole heart. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Which declares that man of himself can know nothing till God gives the heart and understanding.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">jer 24:8</a></font></span></p>And as the bad figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so bad; surely thus saith the LORD, So will I give Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the remnant of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and them that dwell (d) in the land of Egypt: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Who fled there for comfort.
