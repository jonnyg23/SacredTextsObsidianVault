 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#001">Psalms 116:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">psa 116:1</a></font></span></p>I (a) love the LORD, because he hath heard my voice [and] my supplications. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) He grants that no pleasure is so great as to feel God's help in our need, neither that anything more stirs up our love toward him.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#002">Psalms 116:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">psa 116:2</a></font></span></p>Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon [him] (b) as long as I live. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) That is in convenient time to seek help, which was when he was in distress.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#005">Psalms 116:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">psa 116:5</a></font></span></p>Gracious [is] the LORD, and righteous; yea, our God [is] (c) merciful. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) He shows forth the fruit of his love in calling on him, confessing him to be just and merciful and to help them who are destitute of aid and counsel.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#007">Psalms 116:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">psa 116:7</a></font></span></p>Return unto thy rest, O (d) my soul; for the LORD hath dealt bountifully with thee. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Which was disturbed before, now rest on the Lord, for he has been beneficial towards you.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#009">Psalms 116:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">psa 116:9</a></font></span></p>I will (e) walk before the LORD in the land of the living. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) The Lord will preserve me and save my life.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#010">Psalms 116:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">psa 116:10</a></font></span></p>(f) I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) I felt all these things, and therefore was moved by faith to confess them, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#013">Co2 4:13</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#011">Psalms 116:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">psa 116:11</a></font></span></p>I said in my (g) haste, All men [are] liars. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) In my great distress I thought God would not regard man, who is but lies and vanity, yet I overcame this temptation and felt the contrary.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#013">Psalms 116:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">psa 116:13</a></font></span></p>I will (h) take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the LORD. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) In the Law they used to make a banquet when they gave solemn thanks to God, and to take the cup and drink in sign of thanksgiving.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#015">Psalms 116:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">psa 116:15</a></font></span></p>Precious in the sight of the LORD [is] the (i) death of his saints. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) I perceive that God has a care over his, so that he both disposes their death, and takes an account.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#018">Psalms 116:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">psa 116:18</a></font></span></p>I will pay my (k) vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) I will thank him for his benefits, for that is a just payment, to confess that we owe all to God.
