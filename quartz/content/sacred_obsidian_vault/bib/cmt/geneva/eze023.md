 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#002">Ezekiel 23:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">eze 23:2</a></font></span></p>Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one (a) mother: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Meaning, Israel and Judah who both came out of one family.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#003">Ezekiel 23:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">eze 23:3</a></font></span></p>And they committed harlotries in (b) Egypt; they committed harlotries in their youth: there were their breasts pressed, and there they bruised the teats of their virginity. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) They became idolaters after the manner of the Egyptians.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#004">Ezekiel 23:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">eze 23:4</a></font></span></p>And the names of (c) them [were] Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister: and they were mine, and they bore sons and daughters. Thus [were] their names; Samaria [is] Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Aholah signifies a mansion or dwelling in herself, meaning Samaria, which was the royal city of Israel and Aholibah signifies my mansion in her, by which is meant Jerusalem, where God's temple was.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#005">Ezekiel 23:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">eze 23:5</a></font></span></p>And Aholah played the harlot when (d) she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians [her] neighbours, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) When the Israelites were named the people of God, they became idolaters and forsook God, and put their trust in the Assyrians.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#008">Ezekiel 23:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">eze 23:8</a></font></span></p>Neither left she her harlotries [brought] from Egypt: for in her youth they (e) lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured their immorality upon her. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) The Holy Spirit uses these terms which seem strange to chaste ears, to cause this wicked vice of idolatry to be so abhorred that no one could stand to hear the name of it.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#010">Ezekiel 23:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">eze 23:10</a></font></span></p>These uncovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became a byword among women; for (f) they had executed judgment upon her. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Meaning the Assyrians.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#014">Ezekiel 23:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">eze 23:14</a></font></span></p>And [that] she increased her harlotries: for when she saw men (g) portrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) This declares that no words are able to sufficiently express the rage of idolaters and therefore the Holy Spirit here compares them to those who in their raging love and filthy lusts dote on the images and paintings of them after whom they lust.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#023">Ezekiel 23:23</a></p>

 <p>
 </p><p>(h) These were the names of certain princes and captains under Nebuchadnezzar.

 <p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_037">eze 23:37</a></font></span></p>That they have committed adultery, and blood [is] in their hands, and with their idols have they committed adultery, and have also caused their sons, whom they bore to me, to pass for them through [the fire], to (o) devour [them]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(o) That is, to be sacrifices to their idols, read (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#020">Eze 16:20</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#040">Ezekiel 23:40</a></p>

 <p>
 </p><p>(p) They sent into other countries to have such as would teach the service of their idols.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#041">Ezekiel 23:41</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_041">eze 23:41</a></font></span></p>And satest (q) upon a stately bed, and a table prepared before it, upon which thou hast set my incense and my oil.
