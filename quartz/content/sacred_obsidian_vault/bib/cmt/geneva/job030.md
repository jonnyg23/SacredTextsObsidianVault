 <p>
 </p><p>(c) That is, their fathers died of hunger before they came to age.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#005">Job 30:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">job 30:5</a></font></span></p>They were (d) driven forth from among [men], (they cried after them as [after] a thief;)

 <p>
 </p><p>(n) That is, God has brought me into contempt.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#021">Job 30:21</a></p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">job 30:22</a></font></span></p>Thou liftest me up to the (p) wind; thou causest me to ride [upon it], and dissolvest my substance.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">job 30:26</a></font></span></p>When I looked for good, then (r) evil came [unto me]: and when I waited for light, there came darkness. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(r) Instead of comforting they mocked me.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_028">job 30:28</a></font></span></p>I went mourning (s) without the sun: I stood up, (t) [and] I cried in the congregation.
