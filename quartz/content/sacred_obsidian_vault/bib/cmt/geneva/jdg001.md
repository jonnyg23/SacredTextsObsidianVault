 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">jdg 1:1</a></font></span></p>Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel (a) asked the LORD, saying, (b) Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) By the judgment of Urim; Read (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#030">Exo 28:30</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#021">Num 27:21</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#006">Sa1 28:6</a>)

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">jdg 1:3</a></font></span></p>And Judah said unto Simeon his (c) brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) For the tribe of Simeon had their inheritance within the tribe of Judah, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#001">Jos 19:1</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#006">Judges 1:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">jdg 1:6</a></font></span></p>But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and (d) cut off his thumbs and his great toes. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) This was God's just judgment, as the tyrant himself confesses, that as he had done, so did he receive, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#019">Lev 24:19-20</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#008">Judges 1:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">jdg 1:8</a></font></span></p>Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the (e) city on fire.

 <p>
 </p><p>(f) These three were giants, and the children of Anak.

 <p>
 </p><p>(h) This was one of the names of Moses father in law, read (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#029">Num 10:29</a>).
