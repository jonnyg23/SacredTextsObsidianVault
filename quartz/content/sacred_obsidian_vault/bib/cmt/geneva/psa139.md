 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">psa 139:2</a></font></span></p>Thou knowest my (a) downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) He confesses that neither our actions, thoughts or any part of our life can be hid from God, though he seems to be far off.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#003">Psalms 139:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">psa 139:3</a></font></span></p>Thou (b) compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted [with] all my ways. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) So that they are evidently known to you.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#004">Psalms 139:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">psa 139:4</a></font></span></p>For [there is] not a word in my (c) tongue, [but], lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) You know my meaning before I speak.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#005">Psalms 139:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">psa 139:5</a></font></span></p>Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine (d) hand upon me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) You so guide me with your hand, that I can turn no way, but where you appoint me.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#007">Psalms 139:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">psa 139:7</a></font></span></p>Whither shall I go from thy (e) spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) From your power and knowledge?  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#010">Psalms 139:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">psa 139:10</a></font></span></p>Even there shall thy hand (f) lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Your power holds me so fast that there is no way I can escape from you.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#011">Psalms 139:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">psa 139:11</a></font></span></p>If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be (g) light about me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Though darkness is a hinderance to man's sight, yet is serves your eyes as well as the light.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#013">Psalms 139:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">psa 139:13</a></font></span></p>For thou hast (h) possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) You have made me in all parts and therefore must know me.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#014">Psalms 139:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">psa 139:14</a></font></span></p>I will praise thee; for I am (i) fearfully [and] wonderfully made: marvellous [are] thy works; and [that] my soul knoweth right well. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) Considering your wonderful work in forming me, I cannot but praise you and fear your mighty power.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#015">Psalms 139:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">psa 139:15</a></font></span></p>My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, [and] curiously wrought (k) in the lowest parts of the earth. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) That is, in my mother's womb: which he compares to the inward parts of the earth.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#016">Psalms 139:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">psa 139:16</a></font></span></p>Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; (l) and in thy book all [my members] were written, [which] in continuance were fashioned, when [as yet there was] none of them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) Seeing that you knew me before I was composed of either flesh or bone, much more now must you know me when you have fashioned me.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#017">Psalms 139:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">psa 139:17</a></font></span></p>How (m) precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them! 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) How should we esteem the excellent declaration of your wisdom in the creation of man?  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#018">Psalms 139:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">psa 139:18</a></font></span></p>[If] I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, (n) I am still with thee. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(n) I continually see new opportunity to meditate in your wisdom, and to praise you.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#021">Psalms 139:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">psa 139:21</a></font></span></p>Do not I (o) hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(o) He teaches us boldly to contemn all the hatred of the wicked and friendship of the world, when they would prevent us from serving God sincerely.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#024">Psalms 139:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">psa 139:24</a></font></span></p>And see if [there be any] (p) wicked way in me, and lead me in the (q) way everlasting. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(p) Or any heinous or rebellious way: meaning that though he was subject to sin, yet he was not given to wickedness, and to provoke God by rebellion. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(q) That is, continue your favour toward me to the end.
