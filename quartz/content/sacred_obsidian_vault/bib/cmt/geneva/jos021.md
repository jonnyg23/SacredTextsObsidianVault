 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">jos 21:2</a></font></span></p>And they spake unto them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, The LORD commanded (a) by the hand of Moses to give us cities to dwell in, with the suburbs thereof for our cattle. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) By Moses, by whose ministry God showed his power.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#004">Joshua 21:4</a></p>

 <p>
 </p><p>(b) He means those that were priests: for some were but Levites. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(c) Every tribe gave more or fewer cities according to the size of their inheritance, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#008">Num 35:8</a>).

 <p>
 </p><p>(d) For Aaron came from Kohath, and therefore the priests office remained in that family.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#013">Joshua 21:13</a></p>

 <p>
 </p><p>(f) The suburbs were a thousand cubits from the wall of the cities round about, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#004">Num 35:4</a>).

 <p>
 </p><p>(g) That were not priests.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">jos 21:21</a></font></span></p>For they gave them (h) Shechem with her suburbs in mount Ephraim, [to be] a city of refuge for the slayer; and Gezer with her suburbs, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Hebron and Shechem were the two cities of refuge under the Kohathites.

 <p>
 </p><p>(k) Golan and Kedesh were the cities of refuge under the Gershonites.

 <p>
 </p><p>(l) They are here called the rest, because they are last numbered, and Merari was the younger brother, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#011">Gen 46:11</a>).
