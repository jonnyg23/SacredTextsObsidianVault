 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#009">Job 33:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">job 33:9</a></font></span></p>I am (d) clean without transgression, I [am] innocent; neither [is there] iniquity in me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) He repeats Job's words, by which he protested his innocency in various places, but especially in the 13th, 16th and 30th chapters.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#013">Job 33:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">job 33:13</a></font></span></p>Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not (e) account of any of his matters. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) The cause of his judgments is not always declared to man.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#014">Job 33:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">job 33:14</a></font></span></p>For God speaketh (f) once, yea twice, [yet man] perceiveth it not. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Though God by various examples of his judgments speak to man, yet the reason for it is not known, yea and though God should speak yet is he not understood.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#015">Job 33:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">job 33:15</a></font></span></p>In a dream, in a (g) vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) God, he says, speaks commonly, either by visions to teach us the cause of his judgments, of else by affliction or by his messenger.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#016">Job 33:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">job 33:16</a></font></span></p>Then he openeth the ears of men, and (h) sealeth their instruction, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) That is, determined to send on them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#017">Job 33:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">job 33:17</a></font></span></p>That he may withdraw man [from his] purpose, and hide (i) pride from man. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) He shows for why God sends afflictions: to beat down man's pride, and to turn from evil.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#020">Job 33:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">job 33:20</a></font></span></p>So that his (k) life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) That is, his painful and miserable life.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#022">Job 33:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">job 33:22</a></font></span></p>Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life (l) to the destroyers. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) To them that will bury him.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#023">Job 33:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">job 33:23</a></font></span></p>If there be a (m) messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, (n) to shew unto man his uprightness: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) A man sent from God to declare his will. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(n) A singular man, and as one chosen out of a thousand, who is able to declare the great mercies of God to sinners: and in which man's righteousness stands, which is through the justice of Jesus Christ.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#024">Job 33:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">job 33:24</a></font></span></p>Then he is (o) gracious unto him, and saith, (p) Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(o) He shows that it is a sure token of God's mercy toward sinners, when he causes his word to be preached to them. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(p) That is, the minister will by the preaching of the word pronounce to him the forgiveness of his sins.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#025">Job 33:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">job 33:25</a></font></span></p>His flesh shall be (q) fresher than a child's: he shall return to the days of his youth: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(q) He will feel God's favour and rejoice; declaring by this in which stands the true joy of the faithful, and that God will restore him to health, which is a token of his blessing.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#026">Job 33:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">job 33:26</a></font></span></p>He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his (r) righteousness. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(r) God will forgive his sins, and accept him as just.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#027">Job 33:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">job 33:27</a></font></span></p>He looketh upon men, and [if any] say, I have sinned, and (s) perverted [that which was] right, and it profited (t) me not; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(s) That is, done wickedly. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(t) But my sins have been the cause of God's wrath toward me.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#028">Job 33:28</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_028">job 33:28</a></font></span></p>(u) He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(u) God will forgive the penitent sinner.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#029">Job 33:29</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">job 33:29</a></font></span></p>Lo, all these [things] worketh God (x) oftentimes with man, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(x) Meaning, as often as a sinner repents.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#032">Job 33:32</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_032">job 33:32</a></font></span></p>If thou hast any (y) thing to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to (z) justify thee. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(y) If you doubt anything, or see opportunity to speak against it. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(z) That is, to show you, in which mans justification consists.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#004">Job 33:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">job 33:4</a></font></span></p>The (a) Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) I confess the power of God, and am one of his, therefore you should hear me.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#006">Job 33:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">job 33:6</a></font></span></p>Behold, I [am] according to thy wish in (b) God's stead: I also am formed out of the clay. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Because Job had wished to dispute his cause with God, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#021">Job 16:21</a>) so that he might do it without fear, Elihu says, he will reason in God's stead, whom he does not need to fear.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#007">Job 33:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">job 33:7</a></font></span></p>Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand (c) be heavy upon thee. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) I will not handle you so roughly as these others have done.
