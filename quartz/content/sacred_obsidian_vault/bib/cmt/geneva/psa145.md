 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#001">Psalms 145:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">psa 145:1</a></font></span></p>"David's [Psalm] of praise." (a) I will extol thee, my God, O king; and I will bless thy name for ever and ever. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) He shows which sacrifices are pleasant and acceptable to God, even praise and thanksgiving and seeing that God still continues his benefits toward us, we ought never to be weary in praising him for the same.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#003">Psalms 145:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">psa 145:3</a></font></span></p>(b) Great [is] the LORD, and greatly to be praised; and his greatness [is] unsearchable. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) By this he declares that all power is subject to God, and that no worldly promotion should obscure God's glory.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#004">Psalms 145:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">psa 145:4</a></font></span></p>One generation shall praise thy works to (c) another, and shall declare thy mighty acts. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Even as the reason for man's creation and his preservation in this life is to praise God, therefore he requires that not only we ourselves do this, but cause all others to do the same.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#006">Psalms 145:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">psa 145:6</a></font></span></p>And [men] shall speak of the might of thy (d) terrible acts: and I will declare thy greatness. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Of your terrible judgments against the wicked.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#008">Psalms 145:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">psa 145:8</a></font></span></p>The LORD [is] gracious, and full of (e) compassion; slow to anger, and of great mercy. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) He describes after what sort God shows himself to all his creatures though our sins have provoked his vengeance against all: that is, merciful not only in pardoning the sins of his elect, but in doing good even to the reprobate, although they cannot feel the sweet comfort of the same.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#011">Psalms 145:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">psa 145:11</a></font></span></p>(f) They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) The praise of your glory belongs in all your creatures and though the wicked would obscure the same by their silence, yet the faithful are always mindful of the same.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#012">Psalms 145:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">psa 145:12</a></font></span></p>To make known to the sons of men his (g) mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) He shows that all things are out of order, only but where God reigns.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#014">Psalms 145:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">psa 145:14</a></font></span></p>The LORD upholdeth all that (h) fall, and raiseth up all [those that be] bowed down. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Who being in misery and affliction would faint and fall away if God did not uphold them, and therefore they should revere him who reigns in heaven and suffer themselves to be governed by him.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#015">Psalms 145:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">psa 145:15</a></font></span></p>The eyes of (i) all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their meat in due season. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) That is, as well of man as of beast.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#017">Psalms 145:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">psa 145:17</a></font></span></p>The LORD [is] (k) righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) He praises God, not only because he is beneficial to all his creatures, but also in that he justly punishes the wicked, and mercifully examines his by the cross, giving them strength and delivering them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#018">Psalms 145:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">psa 145:18</a></font></span></p>The LORD [is] nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in (l) truth. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) Which only belongs to the faithful: and this virtue is contrary to infidelity, doubting, impatience and murmuring.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#019">Psalms 145:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">psa 145:19</a></font></span></p>He will fulfil the (m) desire of them that fear him: he also will hear their cry, and will save them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) For they will ask or wish for nothing, but according to his will, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#014">Jo1 5:14</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#021">Psalms 145:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">psa 145:21</a></font></span></p>My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD: and let all (n) flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(n) That is, all men will be bound to praise him.
