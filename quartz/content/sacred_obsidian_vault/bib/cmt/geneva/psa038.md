 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#001">Psalms 38:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">psa 38:1</a></font></span></p>"A Psalm of David, to bring to (a) remembrance." O LORD, rebuke me not in thy (b) wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) To put himself and others in mind of God's chastisement for sin. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) He desires not to be exempted from God's rod, but that he would so moderate his hand, that he might be able to bear it.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#002">Psalms 38:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">psa 38:2</a></font></span></p>For thine (c) arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Your sickness, with which you have visited me.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#003">Psalms 38:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">psa 38:3</a></font></span></p>[There is] no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither [is there any] rest in my bones because of my (d) sin. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) David acknowledges God to be just in his punishments, because his sins had deserved much more.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#004">Psalms 38:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">psa 38:4</a></font></span></p>For mine (e) iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) He confesses his sins, God's justice, and makes prayer his refuge.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#005">Psalms 38:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">psa 38:5</a></font></span></p>My wounds stink [and] are corrupt because of (f) my foolishness. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) That rather gave place to my own lusts, than to the will of God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#008">Psalms 38:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">psa 38:8</a></font></span></p>I am feeble and sore broken: I (g) have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) This example warns us never to despair, no matter how great the torment: but always to cry to God with sure trust for deliverance.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#010">Psalms 38:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">psa 38:10</a></font></span></p>My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, (h) it also is gone from me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) My sight fails me for sorrow.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#011">Psalms 38:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">psa 38:11</a></font></span></p>My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my (i) kinsmen stand afar off. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) Partly for fear and partly for pride, they denied all duty and friendship.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#013">Psalms 38:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">psa 38:13</a></font></span></p>But I, as a (k) deaf [man], heard not; and [I was] as a dumb man [that] openeth not his mouth. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) For I can have no audience before men, and therefore patiently wait for the help of God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#016">Psalms 38:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">psa 38:16</a></font></span></p>For I said, [Hear me], lest [otherwise] they should rejoice over me: (l) when my foot slippeth, they magnify [themselves] against me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) That is, if they see that you do not help me in time, they will mock and triumph as though you had forsaken me.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#017">Psalms 38:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">psa 38:17</a></font></span></p>For I [am] ready to (m) halt, and my sorrow [is] continually before me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) I am without hope to recover my strength.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#019">Psalms 38:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">psa 38:19</a></font></span></p>But mine (n) enemies [are] lively, [and] they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(n) In my greatest misery they most rejoice.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#020">Psalms 38:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">psa 38:20</a></font></span></p>They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I follow [the thing that] (o) good [is]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(o) He would rather have the hatred of all the world, than fail in any part of his duty to God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#022">Psalms 38:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">psa 38:22</a></font></span></p>Make haste to help me, O Lord my (p) salvation. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(p) Who is the author of my salvation: and this declares that he prayed with sure hope of deliverance.
