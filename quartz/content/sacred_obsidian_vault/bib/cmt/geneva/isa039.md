 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">isa 39:1</a></font></span></p>At that time (a) Merodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent (b) letters and a present to Hezekiah: for he had heard that he had been sick, and had recovered. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) This was the first king of Babylon, who overcame the Assyrians in the tenth year of his reign.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#002">Isaiah 39:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">isa 39:2</a></font></span></p>And Hezekiah was (c) glad of them, and showed them the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armour, and all that was found in his treasuries: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah did not show them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Read (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#013">Kg2 20:13</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#025">Ch2 32:25</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#031">Ch2 32:31</a>).

 <p>
 </p><p>(d) He asks him of the particulars, to make him understand the craft of the wicked, which he before being overcome with their flattery and blinded with ambition, could not see.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#006">Isaiah 39:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">isa 39:6</a></font></span></p>Behold, the days come, that all that [is] in thy house, and [that] which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be (e) carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the LORD. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) By the grievousness of the punishment is declared how greatly God detested ambition and vain glory.

 <p>
 </p><p>(f) That is, officers and servants.
