 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#003">Numbers 16:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">num 16:3</a></font></span></p>And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them, (a) [Ye take] too much upon you, seeing all the congregation [are] holy, (b) every one of them, and the LORD [is] among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the LORD? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Or let it suffice you: meaning, to have abused them this long. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) All are equally holy: therefore no one should be preferred above other: thus the wicked reason against God's ordinance.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#005">Numbers 16:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">num 16:5</a></font></span></p>And he spake unto Korah and unto all his company, saying, Even to morrow the LORD will shew who [are] his, and [who is] holy; and will cause [him] to come near unto him: even [him] whom he hath (c) chosen will he cause to come near unto him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) To be the priest and to offer.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#007">Numbers 16:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">num 16:7</a></font></span></p>And put fire therein, and put incense in them before the LORD to morrow: and it shall be [that] the man whom the LORD doth choose, he [shall be] holy: (d) [ye take] too much upon you, ye sons of Levi. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) He lays the same to their charge justly, with which they wrongfully charged him.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#010">Numbers 16:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">num 16:10</a></font></span></p>And he hath brought thee near [to (e) him], and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee: and seek ye the priesthood also? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) To serve in the congregation, as in the verse before.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#013">Numbers 16:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">num 16:13</a></font></span></p>[Is it] a small thing that thou hast brought us up (f) out of a land that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Thus they spoke contemptuously, preferring Egypt to Canaan.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#014">Numbers 16:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">num 16:14</a></font></span></p>Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou (g) put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Will you make those who searched the land believe that they did not see that which they saw?  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#016">Numbers 16:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">num 16:16</a></font></span></p>And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company (h) before the LORD, thou, and they, and Aaron, to morrow: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) At the door of the tabernacle.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#019">Numbers 16:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">num 16:19</a></font></span></p>And Korah gathered all the (l) congregation against them unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the congregation. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) All that were of their faction.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#026">Numbers 16:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">num 16:26</a></font></span></p>And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed (k) in all their sins. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) With them that have committed so many sins.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#028">Numbers 16:28</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_028">num 16:28</a></font></span></p>And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me to do all these works; for [I have] not [done them] of mine own (l) mind. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) I have not invented them from my own brain.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#030">Numbers 16:30</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_030">num 16:30</a></font></span></p>But if the LORD make (m) a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that [appertain] unto them, and they go down quick into (n) the pit; then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the LORD. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) Or, show a strange sight. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(n) Or, deep and dark places of the earth.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#038">Numbers 16:38</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_038">num 16:38</a></font></span></p>The censers of these sinners (o) against their own souls, let them make them broad plates [for] a covering of the altar: for they offered them before the LORD, therefore they are hallowed: and they shall be a (p) sign unto the children of Israel. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(o) Who caused their own death. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(p) Of God's judgments against rebels.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#040">Numbers 16:40</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_040">num 16:40</a></font></span></p>[To be] a memorial unto the children of Israel, that no stranger, which [is] not of the seed of Aaron, come near to offer incense before the LORD; that he be not as (q) Korah, and as his company: as the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(q) Who presumed above his calling.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#046">Numbers 16:46</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_046">num 16:46</a></font></span></p>And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein from off the (r) altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the LORD; the plague is begun. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(r) For it was not lawful to take any other fire, but of the altar of burnt offering, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#001">Lev 10:1</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#047">Numbers 16:47</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_047">num 16:47</a></font></span></p>And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the congregation; and, behold, the (s) plague was begun among the people: and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(s) God had begun to punish the people.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#048">Numbers 16:48</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_048">num 16:48</a></font></span></p>And he stood between the dead and the living; and the (t) plague was stayed. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(t) God drew back his hand and stopped punishing them.
