 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#003">Exodus 13:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">exo 13:3</a></font></span></p>And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of (a) bondage; for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this [place]: there shall no leavened bread be (b) eaten. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Where they were in most cruel slavery. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) To signify that they did not have time to leaven their bread.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#004">Exodus 13:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">exo 13:4</a></font></span></p>This day came ye out in the month (c) Abib. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Containing part of March and part of April, when corn began to ripen in that country.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#006">Exodus 13:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">exo 13:6</a></font></span></p>Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the (d) seventh day [shall be] a feast to the LORD. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Both the seventh and the first day were holy, as in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#016">Exo 12:16</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#008">Exodus 13:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">exo 13:8</a></font></span></p>And thou shalt shew thy son (e) in that day, saying, [This is done] because of that [which] the LORD did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) When you celebrate the feast of unleavened bread.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#009">Exodus 13:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">exo 13:9</a></font></span></p>And it shall be for a sign unto thee (f) upon thine hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the LORD'S law may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) You will constantly remember it, as you would of a thing that is in your hand, or before your eyes.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#013">Exodus 13:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">exo 13:13</a></font></span></p>And every firstling of an (g) ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou (h) redeem. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) This is also understood about the horse and other beasts which were not offered in sacrifice. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(h) By offering a clean beast in sacrifice; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#006">Lev 12:6</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#017">Exodus 13:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">exo 13:17</a></font></span></p>And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not [through] the way of the land of the Philistines, although that [was] near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they (i) see war, and they return to Egypt: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) Which the Philistines would have made against them by blocking their passage.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#018">Exodus 13:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">exo 13:18</a></font></span></p>But God led the people about, [through] the way of the wilderness of the Red sea: and the children of Israel went up (k) harnessed out of the land of Egypt. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) That is, not secretly but openly and as the word signifies, set in order by five and five.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#021">Exodus 13:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">exo 13:21</a></font></span></p>And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a (l) cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) To defend them from the heat of the sun.
