 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#001">Psalms 101:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">psa 101:1</a></font></span></p>"A Psalm of David." I will (a) sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O LORD, will I sing. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) David considers what manner of King he would be, when God would place him in the throne, promising openly, that he would be merciful and just.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#002">Psalms 101:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">psa 101:2</a></font></span></p>I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. (b) O when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Though as yet you deferred to place me in the kingly dignity, yet I will give myself to wisdom and uprightness being a private man.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#003">Psalms 101:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">psa 101:3</a></font></span></p>I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate (c) the work of them that turn aside; [it] shall not cleave to me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) He shows that magistrates do not do their duties, unless they are enemies to all vice.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#005">Psalms 101:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">psa 101:5</a></font></span></p>Whoso privily (d) slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off: him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) In promising to punish these vices, which are most pernicious in them that are about Kings, he declares that he will punish all.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#006">Psalms 101:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">psa 101:6</a></font></span></p>Mine eyes [shall be] upon the (e) faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) He shows what the true use of the sword is, to punish the wicked and to maintain the good.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#008">Psalms 101:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">psa 101:8</a></font></span></p>(f) I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the LORD. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Magistrates must immediately punish vice, lest it grow to further inconvenience; and if heathen magistrates are bound to do this, how much more they who have the charge of the Church of God?
