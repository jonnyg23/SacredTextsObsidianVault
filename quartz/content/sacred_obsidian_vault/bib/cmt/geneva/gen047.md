 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#002">Genesis 47:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">gen 47:2</a></font></span></p>And he took some of his brethren, [even] (a) five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) That the king might be assured that they had come, and to see what type of people they were.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#006">Genesis 47:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">gen 47:6</a></font></span></p>The (b) land of Egypt [is] before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest [any] men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my cattle. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Joseph's great modesty appears in that he would attempt nothing without the king's commandment.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#011">Genesis 47:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">gen 47:11</a></font></span></p>And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of (c) Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Which was a city in the country of Goshen, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#011">Exo 1:11</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#012">Genesis 47:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">gen 47:12</a></font></span></p>And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father's household, with bread, (d) according to [their] families. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Some read that he fed them as little babies, because they could not provide for themselves against that famine.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#014">Genesis 47:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">gen 47:14</a></font></span></p>And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and (e) Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) In which he both declares his faithfulness to the king, and his freedom from covetousness.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#019">Genesis 47:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">gen 47:19</a></font></span></p>Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our (f) land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh: and give [us] seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be not desolate. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) For unless the ground is tilled and sown, it perishes and is as if it was dead.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#021">Genesis 47:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">gen 47:21</a></font></span></p>And as for the people, he (g) removed them to cities from [one] end of the borders of Egypt even to the [other] end thereof. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) By this changing they signified that they had nothing of their own, but received everything from the king's generosity.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#026">Genesis 47:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">gen 47:26</a></font></span></p>And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day, [that] Pharaoh should have the fifth [part]; (h) except the land of the priests only, [which] became not Pharaoh's. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Pharaoh, in providing for idolatrous priests, will be a condemnation to all those who neglect the true ministers of God's word.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#030">Genesis 47:30</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_030">gen 47:30</a></font></span></p>But I will (i) lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) By this he demonstrated that he died in the faith of his fathers, teaching his children to hope for the promised land.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#031">Genesis 47:31</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_031">gen 47:31</a></font></span></p>And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel (k) bowed himself upon the bed's head. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) He rejoiced that Joseph had promised him, and setting himself up on his pillows, praised God; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#010">Ch1 29:10</a>).
