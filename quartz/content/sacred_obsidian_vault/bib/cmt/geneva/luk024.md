 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#001">Luke 24:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">luk 24:1</a></font></span></p>Now upon the (1) first [day] of the week, very (a) early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain [others] with them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(1) Poor humble women, who were certainly not expecting it, are chosen to be the first witnesses of the resurrection, so that there might not be any suspicion of either deceit or violence. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(a) Very early, as Mark says: or as John says, while it was yet dark, that is, when it was yet hardly the dawning of day.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#009">Luke 24:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">luk 24:9</a></font></span></p>(2) And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(2) The cowardly and dastardly mind of the disciples is reproved by the brave courage of women (made so by God's great mercies) to show that the kingdom of God consists in an extraordinary power.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#012">Luke 24:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">luk 24:12</a></font></span></p>(3) Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and (b) stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(3) Christ uses the incredulity of his disciples for the fuller setting forth of the truth of his resurrection, lest they should seem to have believed that too lightly which they preached afterward to all the world. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) As it were holding down his head, and bowing his neck, looked diligently in.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#013">Luke 24:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">luk 24:13</a></font></span></p>(4) And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem [about] threescore furlongs. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(4) The resurrection is proved by two other witnesses who saw it, and all the circumstances surrounding it declare that it was no forged event thought up on purpose in their own minds.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#016">Luke 24:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">luk 24:16</a></font></span></p>(c) But their eyes were holden that they should not know him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Were held back and stayed, God no doubt appointing this to be so: and therefore his body was not invisible, but rather their eyes were dimmed.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#018">Luke 24:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">luk 24:18</a></font></span></p>And (d) the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Some of the old fathers think that the other disciple was the same evangelist who wrote this book, but Epiphanius, writing against the Saturnilians, says it was Nathanael; but none of these are certainties.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#020">Luke 24:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">luk 24:20</a></font></span></p>(5) And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(5) It appears by conferring the prophecies of the prophets that all those things are true and certain which the evangelist have put down in writing about Christ.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#031">Luke 24:31</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_031">luk 24:31</a></font></span></p>And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he (e) vanished out of their sight. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Suddenly taken away, and we may not therefore imagine that he was there in an invisible body, but indeed believe that he suddenly changed the place where he was.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#035">Luke 24:35</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_035">luk 24:35</a></font></span></p>And they told what things [were done] in the way, and how he was known of them in (f) breaking of bread. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) When he broke bread, which that people used to do, and as the Jews still do today at the beginning of their meals and say a prayer.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#036">Luke 24:36</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_036">luk 24:36</a></font></span></p>(6) And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace [be] unto you. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(6) The Lord himself shows by certain and necessary signs that he was risen again, and risen in the same body which he had taken upon himself.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#038">Luke 24:38</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_038">luk 24:38</a></font></span></p>And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do (g) thoughts arise in your hearts? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Various and doubtful thoughts which fall often into men's heads, when any strange thing occurs, thoughts of which there is no great likelihood.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#044">Luke 24:44</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_044">luk 24:44</a></font></span></p>(7) And he said unto them, These [are] the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and [in] the prophets, and [in] the psalms, concerning me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(7) The preaching of the gospel, which was promised to the prophets, and performed in his time, is committed unto the apostles, the sum of which is repentance and remission of sins.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#047">Luke 24:47</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_047">luk 24:47</a></font></span></p>And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, (h) beginning at Jerusalem. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) The apostles, who are the preachers of the gospel, beginning at Jerusalem.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#049">Luke 24:49</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_049">luk 24:49</a></font></span></p>And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, (i) until ye be endued with power from on high. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) Until the Holy Spirit comes down from heaven upon you.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#050">Luke 24:50</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_050">luk 24:50</a></font></span></p>(8) And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(8) Christ ascends into heaven, and departing bodily from his disciples, fills their hearts with the Holy Spirit.
