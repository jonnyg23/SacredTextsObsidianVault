 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#001">Genesis 34:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">gen 34:1</a></font></span></p>And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, (a) went out to see the daughters of the land. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) This example teaches us that too much liberty is not to be given to youth.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#004">Genesis 34:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">gen 34:4</a></font></span></p>And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, (b) Get me this damsel to wife. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) This proves that the consent of parents is required in marriage, seeing that even the infidels observed it as a necessary thing.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#014">Genesis 34:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">gen 34:14</a></font></span></p>And they said unto them, (c) We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that [were] a (d) reproach unto us: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) They used the holy ordinance of God a means to accomplish their wicked purpose. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(d) As it is abomination for those who are baptized to be joined to infidels.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#015">Genesis 34:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">gen 34:15</a></font></span></p>But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we [be], that every male of you be (e) circumcised; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Their fault is even greater since they made religion a disguise for their deceit.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#020">Genesis 34:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">gen 34:20</a></font></span></p>And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the (f) gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) For the people used to assemble there, and justice was administered.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#021">Genesis 34:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">gen 34:21</a></font></span></p>These men [are] (g) peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, [it is] large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Thus many pretend to speak for a public profit, when in reality they are only speaking for their own private gain and convenience.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#023">Genesis 34:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">gen 34:23</a></font></span></p>[Shall] not (h) their cattle and their substance and every beast of theirs [be] ours? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Thus they do not lack any form of perversion, who prefer their own convenience before the common good.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#025">Genesis 34:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">gen 34:25</a></font></span></p>And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, (i) Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew (k) all the males. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) For they were the leaders of the company. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(k) The people are punished because of their wicked princes.
