 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">num 30:1</a></font></span></p>And Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes (a) concerning the children of Israel, saying, This [is] the thing which the LORD hath commanded. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Because they might declare them to the Israelites.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#004">Numbers 30:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">num 30:4</a></font></span></p>And her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father shall hold his (b) peace at her: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) For in so doing he approves her.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#005">Numbers 30:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">num 30:5</a></font></span></p>But if her (c) father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not any of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand: and the LORD shall forgive her, because her father disallowed her. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) By not approving or consenting to her vow.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#006">Numbers 30:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">num 30:6</a></font></span></p>And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or (d) uttered ought out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Either by oath, or solemn promise.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#008">Numbers 30:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">num 30:8</a></font></span></p>But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard [it]; then he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered with her lips, wherewith she bound her (e) soul, of none effect: and the LORD shall forgive her. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) For she is in subjection to her husband, and can perform nothing without his consent.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#009">Numbers 30:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">num 30:9</a></font></span></p>But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, wherewith they have bound their souls, shall stand (f) against her. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) For they are not under the authority of the man.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#010">Numbers 30:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">num 30:10</a></font></span></p>And if she vowed in her husband's (h) house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Her husband being alive.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#013">Numbers 30:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">num 30:13</a></font></span></p>Every vow, and every binding oath to (h) afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) To mortify herself by abstinence or other bodily exercise.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#014">Numbers 30:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">num 30:14</a></font></span></p>But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from (i) day to day; then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which [are] upon her: he confirmeth them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard [them]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) And warn her not the same day that he hears it, as in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#008">Num 30:8</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#015">Numbers 30:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">num 30:15</a></font></span></p>But if he shall any ways (k) make them void after that he hath heard [them]; then he shall bear her iniquity. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) Not the same day he heard them, but some day after, the sin will be imputed to him and not to her.
