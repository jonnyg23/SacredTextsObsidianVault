 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#001">Joshua 7:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">jos 7:1</a></font></span></p>But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the (a) accursed thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) In taking that which was commanded to be destroyed.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#002">Joshua 7:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">jos 7:2</a></font></span></p>And Joshua sent men from Jericho to (b) Ai, which [is] beside Bethaven, on the east side of Bethel, and spake unto them, saying, Go up and view the country. And the men went up and viewed Ai. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) This was a city of the Amorites: for there was another so called among the Amorites, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#003">Jer 49:3</a>). The first Ai is called Aiah, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#028">Isa 10:28</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#005">Joshua 7:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">jos 7:5</a></font></span></p>And the (c) men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for they chased them [from] before the gate [even] unto Shebarim, and smote them in the going down: wherefore the hearts of the people melted, and became as water. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) God would by this overthrow make them more earnest to search out and punish the sin committed.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#007">Joshua 7:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">jos 7:7</a></font></span></p>And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord GOD, wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been content, and dwelt on the (d) other side Jordan! 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) This infirmity of his faith shows how we are inclined by nature to distrust.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#009">Joshua 7:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">jos 7:9</a></font></span></p>For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear [of it], and shall environ us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do unto thy great (e) name? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) When your enemies will blaspheme you and say that you were not able to defend us from them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#012">Joshua 7:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">jos 7:12</a></font></span></p>Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, [but] turned [their] backs before their enemies, because they were accursed: neither will I be with you any more, except ye (f) destroy the accursed from among you. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Then to allow wickedness unpunished, is to refuse God willingly.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#013">Joshua 7:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">jos 7:13</a></font></span></p>Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow: for thus saith the LORD God of Israel, [There is] an accursed thing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the (g) accursed thing from among you. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Meaning, the man that took of the thing forbidden.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#015">Joshua 7:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">jos 7:15</a></font></span></p>And it shall be, [that] he that is (h) taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath: because he hath transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he hath wrought folly in Israel. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) That is found guilty, either by lots, or by the judgment of Urim. (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#021">Num 27:21</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#019">Joshua 7:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">jos 7:19</a></font></span></p>And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the LORD God of Israel, and (i) make confession unto him; and tell me now what thou hast done; hide [it] not from me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) By declaring truth: for God is glorified when the truth is confessed.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#021">Joshua 7:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">jos 7:21</a></font></span></p>When I saw among the spoils a goodly (k) Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they [are] hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) Such a rich garment as the states of Babylon wore.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#024">Joshua 7:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">jos 7:24</a></font></span></p>And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the (l) wedge of gold, and his (m) sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them unto the valley of Achor. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) Some read a plate: others, a rod, and some a tongue. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(m) This judgment belonged only to God, and to whom he will reveal it. He had commanded man not to punish the child for the father's sins, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#016">Deu 24:16</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#025">Joshua 7:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">jos 7:25</a></font></span></p>And Joshua said, (n) Why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(n) He declares that this is God's judgment because he had offended, and caused others to be slain.
