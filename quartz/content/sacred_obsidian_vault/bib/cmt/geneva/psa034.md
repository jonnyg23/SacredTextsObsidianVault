 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">psa 34:1</a></font></span></p>"[A Psalm] of David, when he changed his behaviour before Abimelech; who drove him away, and he departed." I will bless the LORD (a) at all times: his praise [shall] continually [be] in my mouth. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) He promised never to become unmindful of God's great benefit for his deliverance.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#002">Psalms 34:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">psa 34:2</a></font></span></p>My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the (b) humble shall hear [thereof], and be glad. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) They who are beaten down with the experience of their own evils.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#004">Psalms 34:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">psa 34:4</a></font></span></p>I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my (c) fears. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Which I conceived for the danger I was in.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#005">Psalms 34:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">psa 34:5</a></font></span></p>They (d) looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not ashamed. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) They will be bold to flee to you for help, when they see your mercies toward me.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#007">Psalms 34:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">psa 34:7</a></font></span></p>The (e) angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Though God's power is sufficient to govern us, yet for man's infirmity he appoints his angels to watch over us.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#010">Psalms 34:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">psa 34:10</a></font></span></p>The young (f) lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the LORD shall not (g) want any good [thing]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) The godly by their patient obedience profit more than they who ravage and spoil. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(g) If they abide the last trial.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#011">Psalms 34:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">psa 34:11</a></font></span></p>Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the (h) fear of the LORD. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) That is, the true religion and worship of God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#012">Psalms 34:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">psa 34:12</a></font></span></p>What man [is he that] desireth life, [and] loveth [many] days, that he may (i) see good? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) Seeing all men naturally desire happiness, he wonders why they cast themselves willingly into misery.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#016">Psalms 34:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">psa 34:16</a></font></span></p>The (k) face of the LORD [is] against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) The anger of God not only destroys the wicked, but also abolishes their name forever.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#018">Psalms 34:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">psa 34:18</a></font></span></p>The LORD [is] nigh unto them that are of a (l) broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) When they seem to be swallowed up with afflictions, then God is at hand to deliver them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#020">Psalms 34:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">psa 34:20</a></font></span></p>(m) He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) And as Christ says, all the hairs of his head.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#021">Psalms 34:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">psa 34:21</a></font></span></p>Evil shall slay the (n) wicked: and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(n) Their wicked enterprises will turn to their own destruction.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#022">Psalms 34:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">psa 34:22</a></font></span></p>The LORD (o) redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(o) For when they seem to be overcome with great dangers and death itself, then God shows himself as their redeemer.
