 <p>
 </p><p>(b) He shows that before this deliverance will come, the Chaldeans would be extremely afflicted by their enemies, and that they would be in such perplexity and sorrow as a woman in her travail as (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#008">Isa 13:8</a>).

 <p>
 </p><p>(d) When I will visit Babylon. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(e) Of the king of Babylon. 
 </p><p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">jer 30:11</a></font></span></p>For I [am] with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: though I make a full end of all nations where I have scattered thee, yet will I not make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, and will not (h) leave thee altogether unpunished. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) In this is commanded God's great mercy toward his, who does not destroy them for their sins, but corrects and chastises them till he has purged and pardoned them and so burns the rods by which he punished them, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#001">Isa 33:1</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#018">Jeremiah 30:18</a></p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">jer 30:21</a></font></span></p>And their (o) nobles shall be from themselves, and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach to me: for who [is] this that engaged his (p) heart to approach to me? saith the LORD.
