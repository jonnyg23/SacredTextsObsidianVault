 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">psa 39:1</a></font></span></p>"To the chief Musician, [even] to (a) Jeduthun, A Psalm of David." I said, (b) I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) This was one of the chief singers, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#041">Ch1 16:41</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) Although he had appointed with himself patiently to have wait for God's timing, yet the vehemency of his pain caused him to break his purpose.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#002">Psalms 39:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">psa 39:2</a></font></span></p>I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, [even] from good; (c) and my sorrow was stirred. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Though when the wicked ruled he thought to have kept silence, yet his zeal caused him to change his mind.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#003">Psalms 39:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">psa 39:3</a></font></span></p>My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned: [then] (d) spake I with my tongue, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) He confesses that he grudged against God, considering the greatness of his sorrows, and the shortness of his life.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#005">Psalms 39:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">psa 39:5</a></font></span></p>Behold, thou hast made my days [as] an handbreadth; and mine age [is] as nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state [is] altogether (e) vanity. Selah. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Yet David offended in that he reasoned with God as though he were too severe toward his weak creature.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#008">Psalms 39:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">psa 39:8</a></font></span></p>Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the reproach of the (f) foolish. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Do not make me a laughing stock to the wicked, wrap me up with the wicked when they are put to shame.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#009">Psalms 39:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">psa 39:9</a></font></span></p>I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because (g) thou didst [it]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Seeing my troubles came from your providence, I ought to have endured them patiently.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#011">Psalms 39:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">psa 39:11</a></font></span></p>When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou (h) makest his (i) beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every man [is] vanity. Selah. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Though your open plagues do not light on them forever, yet your secret curse continually frets them. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(i) The word signifies all that he desires, as health, force, strength, beauty, and in whatever he has delight, so that the rod of God takes away all that is desired in this world.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#013">Psalms 39:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">psa 39:13</a></font></span></p>O spare me, that I may recover strength, (k) before I go hence, and be no more. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) For his sorrow caused him to think that God would destroy him completely, by which we see how hard it is for the saints to keep a measure in their words, when death and despair assails them.
