 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#001">2 Chronicles 26:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">ch2 26:1</a></font></span></p>Then all the people of Judah took (a) Uzziah, who [was] sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Called also Azariah. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#002">2 Chronicles 26:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">ch2 26:2</a></font></span></p>He built (b) Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) He fortified it and made it strong: this city was also called Elath and Elanon near the Red sea. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#005">2 Chronicles 26:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">ch2 26:5</a></font></span></p>And he sought God in the days of (c) Zechariah, who had understanding in the visions of God: and as long as (d) he sought the LORD, God made him to prosper. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) This was not the Zechariah that was the son of Jehoiada, but some other prophet of that name. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(d) For God never forsakes any who seek him, and therefore man is the cause of his own destruction. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#008">2 Chronicles 26:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">ch2 26:8</a></font></span></p>And the Ammonites gave (e) gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread abroad [even] to the entering in of Egypt; for he strengthened [himself] exceedingly. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) That is, they paid tribute in a sign of subjection. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#009">2 Chronicles 26:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">ch2 26:9</a></font></span></p>Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the (f) turning [of the wall], and fortified them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Where the wall or tower turns. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#010">2 Chronicles 26:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">ch2 26:10</a></font></span></p>Also he built towers in the desert, and digged many wells: for he had much cattle, both in the low country, and in the plains: husbandmen [also], and vine dressers in the mountains, and in (g) Carmel: for he loved husbandry. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) That is, in mount Carmel, or as the word signifies in the fruitful field, it is also taken for a green ear of corn when it is full, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#014">Lev 2:14</a>). 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#012">2 Chronicles 26:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">ch2 26:12</a></font></span></p>The whole (h) number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of valour [were] two thousand and six hundred. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Of the chief officers of the king's house, or of the captains and sergeants for war. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#016">2 Chronicles 26:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">ch2 26:16</a></font></span></p>But when he was strong, his heart (i) was lifted up to [his] destruction: for he transgressed against the LORD his God, and went into the temple of the LORD to burn incense upon the altar of incense. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) Thus prosperity causes men to trust in themselves and by forgetting him who is the author of it, procure their own punishment. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#018">2 Chronicles 26:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">ch2 26:18</a></font></span></p>And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, [It appertaineth] not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the LORD, but to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense: (k) go out of the sanctuary; for thou hast trespassed; neither [shall it be] for thine honour from the LORD God. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) Though his zeal seemed to be good and also his intention, yet because they were not governed by the word of God, he did wickedly and was therefore both justly resisted and also punished. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#021">2 Chronicles 26:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">ch2 26:21</a></font></span></p>And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a (l) several house, [being] a leper; for he was cut off from the house of the LORD: and Jotham his son [was] over the king's house, judging the people of the land. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) According to the commandment of the Lord, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#046">Lev 13:46</a>). 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#023">2 Chronicles 26:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">ch2 26:23</a></font></span></p>So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which [belonged] to the kings; for they said, He (m) [is] a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) Therefore was buried apart in the same field but not in the same sepulchre with his predecessors.
