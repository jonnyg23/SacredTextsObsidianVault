 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">gen 46:1</a></font></span></p>And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and (a) offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) By this he signified both that he worshipped the true God, and that he kept in his heart the possession of that land from which need drove him at that time.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#004">Genesis 46:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">gen 46:4</a></font></span></p>I will (b) go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely (c) bring thee up [again]: and Joseph shall (d) put his hand upon thine eyes. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Conducting you by my power. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(c) In your posterity. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(d) Shall shut your eyes when you die: which belongs to him that was most dear or chief of the kindred.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_032">gen 46:32</a></font></span></p>And the men [are] (e) shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) He was not ashamed of his father and kindred, though they were of base condition.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#034">Genesis 46:34</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_034">gen 46:34</a></font></span></p>That ye shall say, Thy servants' trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we, [and] also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd [is] an (f) abomination unto the Egyptians. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) God permits the world to hate his own, so they will forsake the filth of the world, and cling to him.
