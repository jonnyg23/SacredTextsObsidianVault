 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">jo2 1:1</a></font></span></p>The elder unto the (a) elect (b) lady and her children, (1) whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) This is not a proper name, but is to be taken as it sounds that is to say, the worthy and noble lady. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) Excellent and honourable woman. (1) The bond of Christian union is the true and constant profession of the truth.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">jo2 1:3</a></font></span></p>Grace be with you, mercy, [and] peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">jo2 1:4</a></font></span></p>(2) I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in (d) truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(2) This true profession consists both in love towards one another which the Lord has commanded, and also especially in wholesome and sound doctrine, which also is delivered to us: for the commandment of God is a sound and sure foundation both of the rule of conduct and of doctrine, and these cannot be separated from one another, 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(d) According as the truth directs them. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#007">2 John 1:7</a></p>

 <p>
 </p><p>(3) Antichrists fighting against the person and office of Christ had already crept into the Church, in the time of the apostles.

 <p>
 </p><p>(4) He that makes shipwreck of doctrine, loses all. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(e) Beware, and take good heed.

 <p>
 </p><p>(5) We should have nothing to do with those who defend perverse doctrine.
