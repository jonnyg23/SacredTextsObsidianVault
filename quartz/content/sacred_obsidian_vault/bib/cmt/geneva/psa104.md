 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#001">Psalms 104:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">psa 104:1</a></font></span></p>Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou art (a) clothed with honour and majesty. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) The prophet shows that we do not need to enter into the heavens to seek God, for as much as all the order of nature, with the propriety and placing of the elements, are living mirrors to see his majesty in.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#004">Psalms 104:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">psa 104:4</a></font></span></p>Who (b) maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) As the prophet here shows that all visible powers are ready to serve God: so in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#007">Heb 1:7</a>) the angels also, are obedient to his commandment.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#006">Psalms 104:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">psa 104:6</a></font></span></p>Thou coveredst it with the (c) deep as [with] a garment: the (d) waters stood above the mountains. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) You make the sea to be an ornament to the earth. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(d) If by your power you did not bridle the rage of the waters, the whole world would be destroyed.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#011">Psalms 104:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">psa 104:11</a></font></span></p>They give drink to every (e) beast of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) If God provides for the beasts, much more will he extend his provident care to man.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#012">Psalms 104:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">psa 104:12</a></font></span></p>By (f) them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, [which] sing among the branches. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) There is no part of the world so barren where most evident signs of God's blessing do not appear.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#013">Psalms 104:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">psa 104:13</a></font></span></p>He watereth the hills from his (g) chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) From the clouds.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#014">Psalms 104:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">psa 104:14</a></font></span></p>He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of (h) man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) He describes God's providential care over man, who not only provides necessary things for him such as herbs and other meat: but also things to rejoice and comfort him such as wine and oil or ointments.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#019">Psalms 104:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">psa 104:19</a></font></span></p>He appointed (i) the moon for seasons: (k) the sun knoweth his going down. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) As to separate the night from the day, and to note days, months and years. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(k) That is, by his course, either far or near, it notes summer, winter and other seasons.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#021">Psalms 104:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">psa 104:21</a></font></span></p>The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat (l) from God. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) That is, they only find meat according to God's providence, who cares even for the brute beasts.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#023">Psalms 104:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">psa 104:23</a></font></span></p>(m) Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) That is, when the day springs for the light is as it were a shield to defend man against the tyranny and fierceness of beasts.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#024">Psalms 104:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">psa 104:24</a></font></span></p>O LORD, how (n) manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(n) He confesses that no tongue is able to express God's works nor mind to comprehend them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#027">Psalms 104:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">psa 104:27</a></font></span></p>(o) These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give [them] their meat in due season. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(o) God is a nourishing father, who provides for all creatures their daily foods.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#029">Psalms 104:29</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">psa 104:29</a></font></span></p>Thou (p) hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(p) As by your presence all things have life; so if you withdraw your blessings they all perish.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#030">Psalms 104:30</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_030">psa 104:30</a></font></span></p>Thou (q) sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(q) As the death of creatures shows that we are nothing of ourselves: so their generation declares that we receive all things from our Creator.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#032">Psalms 104:32</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_032">psa 104:32</a></font></span></p>He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they (r) smoke. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(r) God's merciful face gives strength to the earth, but his severe countenance burns the mountains.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#035">Psalms 104:35</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_035">psa 104:35</a></font></span></p>Let the sinners be (s) consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(s) Who infect the world, and so cause it to be that God cannot rejoice in his work.
