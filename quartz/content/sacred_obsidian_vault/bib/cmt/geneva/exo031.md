 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#002">Exodus 31:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">exo 31:2</a></font></span></p>See, I (a) have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) I have chosen and made meet, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#030">Exo 35:30</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#003">Exodus 31:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">exo 31:3</a></font></span></p>And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of (b) workmanship, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) This shows that handicrafts are the gifts of God's spirit, and therefore ought to be esteemed.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#006">Exodus 31:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">exo 31:6</a></font></span></p>And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are (c) wise hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) I have instructed them, and increased their knowledge.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#008">Exodus 31:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">exo 31:8</a></font></span></p>And the table and his furniture, and the (d) pure candlestick with all his furniture, and the altar of incense, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) So called, because of the cunning and art used in them, or because the whole was beaten out of the piece.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#011">Exodus 31:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">exo 31:11</a></font></span></p>And the (e) anointing oil, and sweet incense for the holy [place]: according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Which was only to anoint the Priests and the instruments of the tabernacle, not to burn.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#013">Exodus 31:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">exo 31:13</a></font></span></p>Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, (f) Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it [is] a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that [ye] may know that I [am] the LORD that doth sanctify you. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Though I command that these works be done, yet I do not want you to break my Sabbath days.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#014">Exodus 31:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">exo 31:14</a></font></span></p>Ye shall keep the (g) sabbath therefore; for it [is] holy unto you: every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever doeth [any] work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) God repeats this point because the whole keeping of the law stands in the true use of the sabbath, which is to stop working and so obey the will of God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#017">Exodus 31:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">exo 31:17</a></font></span></p>It [is] a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for [in] six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he (h) rested, and was refreshed. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) From creating his creatures, but not from governing and preserving them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#018">Exodus 31:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">exo 31:18</a></font></span></p>And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables (i) of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) By which he declared his will to his people.
