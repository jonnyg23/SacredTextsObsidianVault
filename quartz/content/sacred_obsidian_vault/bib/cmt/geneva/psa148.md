 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">psa 148:2</a></font></span></p>Praise ye him, all (a) his angels: praise ye him, all his hosts. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Because they are members of the same body, he sets them before our eyes, who are most willing and by their prompt obedience teach us to do our duty.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#003">Psalms 148:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">psa 148:3</a></font></span></p>Praise ye him, (b) sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars of light. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) In that God's glory shines in these insensible creatures, this their beauty is as a continual praising of God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#004">Psalms 148:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">psa 148:4</a></font></span></p>Praise him, ye (c) heavens of heavens, and ye (d) waters that [be] above the heavens. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Not that there are various heavens, but because of the spheres and of the situation of the fixed stars and planets, he comprehends by this word the whole heavens. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(d) That is, the rain which is in the middle region of the air, which he here comprehends under the name of the heavens.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#007">Psalms 148:7</a></p>

 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Meaning the great and monstrous fishes, as whales and such like.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#008">Psalms 148:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">psa 148:8</a></font></span></p>(f) Fire, and hail; snow, and vapour; stormy wind fulfilling his word: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Which come not by chance or fortune, but by God's appointed ordinance.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#011">Psalms 148:11</a></p>

 <p>
 </p><p>(g) For the greater gifts that any has received and the more high that one is preferred, the more bound is he to praise God for the same: but neither high nor low condition or degree can be exempted from this duty.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#014">Psalms 148:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">psa 148:14</a></font></span></p>He also exalteth the (h) horn of his people, the praise of all his saints; [even] of the (i) children of Israel, a people near unto him. Praise ye the LORD. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) That is, the dignity, power and glory of his Church. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(i) By reason of his covenant made with Abraham.
