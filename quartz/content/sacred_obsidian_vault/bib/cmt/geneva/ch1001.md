 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001">1 Chronicles 1:1</a></p>

 <p>
 </p><p>The Argument - The laws comprehend both these books in one, which the Grecians because of the length, divide into two: and they are called Chronicles, because they note briefly the history from Adam to the return from their captivity in Babylon. But these are not the books of Chronicles which are mentioned in the books of the kings of Judah and Israel, which set forth the story of both kingdoms, and later perished in the captivity, but an abridgement of the same, and were gathered by Ezra, as the Jews write after their return from Babylon. This first book contains a brief rehearsal of the children of Adam to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and the twelve patriarchs, chiefly of Judah, and the reign of David, because Christ came from him according to the flesh. Therefore it sets forth more amply his acts both concerning civil government, and also the administration and care of things concerning religion, for the good success of which he rejoices and gives thanks to the Lord. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(a) Meaning, that Seth was Adam's son, and Enoch was Seth's son.

 <p>
 </p><p>(b) It would have been sufficient to have named Shem of whom came Abraham and David, but because the world was restored by these three, mention is also made of Ham and Japheth.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">ch1 1:10</a></font></span></p>And Cush begat (c) Nimrod: he began to be mighty upon the earth. 
 <p>

 </p><p>(g) Who came from Shem, and of him Shelah.
