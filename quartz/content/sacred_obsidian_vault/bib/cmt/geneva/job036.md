 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#003">Job 36:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">job 36:3</a></font></span></p>I will fetch (a) my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) He shows that when we speak of God, we must lift our spirits higher than our natural sense is able to reach.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#004">Job 36:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">job 36:4</a></font></span></p>For truly my words [shall] not [be] false: he that is (b) perfect in knowledge [is] with thee. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) You will perceive that I am a faithful instructor, and that I speak to you in the name of God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#005">Job 36:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">job 36:5</a></font></span></p>Behold, God [is] mighty, and despiseth not [any: he is] (c) mighty in strength [and] wisdom. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Strong and constant, and of understanding: for these are the gifts of God, and he loves them in man: but as much as God punished Job now, it is a sign that these are not in him.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#006">Job 36:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">job 36:6</a></font></span></p>He (d) preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Therefore he will not preserve the wicked, but to the humble and afflicted heart he will show grace.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#007">Job 36:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">job 36:7</a></font></span></p>He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with (e) kings [are they] on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) He prefers the godly to honour.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#009">Job 36:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">job 36:9</a></font></span></p>Then he sheweth them their (f) work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) He will move their hearts to feel their sins that they may come to him by repentance as he did Manasseh.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#012">Job 36:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">job 36:12</a></font></span></p>But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die (g) without knowledge. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) That is, in their folly or obstinacy, and so shall cause their own destruction.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#013">Job 36:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">job 36:13</a></font></span></p>But the hypocrites (h) in heart heap up wrath: they (i) cry not when he bindeth them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Which are maliciously bent against God, and flatter themselves in their vices. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(i) When they are in affliction they do not seek God for help, as Asa in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#012">Ch2 16:12</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#014">Job 36:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">job 36:14</a></font></span></p>They die in (k) youth, and their life [is] among the unclean. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) They die of some vile death, and that before they come to age.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#016">Job 36:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">job 36:16</a></font></span></p>Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait [into] a broad place, where [there is] no straitness; and (l) that which should be set on thy table [should be] full of fatness. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) If you had been obedient to God, he would have brought you to freedom and wealth.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#017">Job 36:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">job 36:17</a></font></span></p>But thou hast fulfilled the (m) judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold [on thee]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) You are altogether after the manner of the wicked: for you murmur against the justice of God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#018">Job 36:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">job 36:18</a></font></span></p>(n) Because [there is] wrath, [beware] lest he take thee away with [his] stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(n) God punishes you, lest you forget God in your wealth and so perish.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#020">Job 36:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">job 36:20</a></font></span></p>(o) Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(o) Do not be curious in seeking the cause of God's judgments, when he destroys any.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#021">Job 36:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">job 36:21</a></font></span></p>Take heed, regard not (p) iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(p) And so murmur against God through impatiency.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#025">Job 36:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">job 36:25</a></font></span></p>Every man may see it; man may behold [it] (q) afar off. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(q) The works of God are revealed, that a man may see them afar off, and know God by the same.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#026">Job 36:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">job 36:26</a></font></span></p>Behold, God [is] great, (r) and we know [him] not, neither can the number of his years be searched out. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(r) Our infirmity hinders us so that we cannot attain the perfect knowledge of God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#027">Job 36:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">job 36:27</a></font></span></p>For he maketh small the drops of water: they (s) pour down rain according to the vapour thereof: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(s) That is, the rain comes from those drops of water which he keeps in the clouds.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#029">Job 36:29</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">job 36:29</a></font></span></p>Also can [any] understand the spreadings of the clouds, [or] the noise of his (t) tabernacle? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(t) Meaning, of the clouds, which he calls the tabernacle of God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#030">Job 36:30</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_030">job 36:30</a></font></span></p>Behold, he spreadeth his light upon (u) it, and covereth the (x) bottom of the sea. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(u) Upon the cloud. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(x) That men cannot come to the knowledge of the springs of it.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#031">Job 36:31</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_031">job 36:31</a></font></span></p>For by them judgeth he (y) the people; he giveth meat in abundance. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(y) He shows that the rain has a double use: the one that it declares God's judgments, when it overflows any places, and the other that it makes the land fruitful.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#032">Job 36:32</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_032">job 36:32</a></font></span></p>With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it [not to shine] by [the cloud] that cometh (z) betwixt. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(z) That is, one cloud to dash against another.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#033">Job 36:33</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_033">job 36:33</a></font></span></p>(a) The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) The cold vapour shows him: that is, the cloud of the hot exhalation, which being taken in the cold cloud mounts up toward the place where the fire is, and so anger is engendered; that is, noise and thunderclaps.
