 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">job 34:2</a></font></span></p>Hear my words, O ye (a) wise [men]; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Which are esteemed wise by the world.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#004">Job 34:4</a></p>

 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Let us examine the matter uprightly.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#005">Job 34:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">job 34:5</a></font></span></p>For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken (c) away my judgment. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) That is, has afflicted me without measure.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#006">Job 34:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">job 34:6</a></font></span></p>Should I lie against my (d) right? my wound [is] (e) incurable without transgression. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Should I say, I am wicked, being an innocent? 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(e) I am more punished, than my sin deserves.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#007">Job 34:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">job 34:7</a></font></span></p>What man [is] like Job, [who] drinketh up (f) scorning like water? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Which is compelled to receive your reproach and scorns of many for his foolish words.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#008">Job 34:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">job 34:8</a></font></span></p>Which goeth in (g) company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Meaning that Job was like the wicked, because he seemed not to glorify God and submit himself to his judgments.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#009">Job 34:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">job 34:9</a></font></span></p>For he hath said, (h) It profiteth a man nothing that he should (i) delight himself with God. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) He wrests Job's words who said that God's children are often punished in this world, and the wicked go free. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(i) That is, live godly, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#022">Gen 5:22</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#014">Job 34:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">job 34:14</a></font></span></p>If (k) he set his heart upon man, [if] he gather unto himself his spirit (l) and his breath; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) To destroy him. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(l) The breath of life which he gave man.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#017">Job 34:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">job 34:17</a></font></span></p>Shall even he that hateth right (m) govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) If God were not just, how could be govern the world?  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#018">Job 34:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">job 34:18</a></font></span></p>[Is it fit] to say to a king, [Thou art] (n) wicked? [and] to princes, [Ye are] ungodly? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(n) If man by nature fears to speak evil of such as have power, then they should be much more afraid to speak evil of God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#020">Job 34:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">job 34:20</a></font></span></p>In a moment shall they die, (o) and the people shall be troubled at midnight, (p) and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(o) When they look not for it. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(p) The messengers of visitation that God will send.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#023">Job 34:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">job 34:23</a></font></span></p>For he will not lay upon man more [than right]; that he should (q) enter into judgment with God. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(q) God does not afflict man above measure so that he should have opportunity to contend with him.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#024">Job 34:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">job 34:24</a></font></span></p>He shall break in pieces mighty men without (r) number, and set others in their stead. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(r) For all his creatures are at hand to serve him, so that he needs not to seek for any other army.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#025">Job 34:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">job 34:25</a></font></span></p>Therefore he knoweth their (s) works, and he overturneth [them] in the (t) night, so that they are destroyed. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(s) Make it known that they are wicked. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(t) Declare the things that were hid.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#026">Job 34:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">job 34:26</a></font></span></p>He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of (u) others; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(u) Meaning, openly in the sight of all men.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#028">Job 34:28</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_028">job 34:28</a></font></span></p>So that they cause the cry of the poor to (x) come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(x) By their cruelty and extortion.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#030">Job 34:30</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_030">job 34:30</a></font></span></p>That the (y) hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(y) When tyrants sit in the throne of justice which under pretence of executing justice are hypocrites and oppress the people, it is a sign that God has drawn back his countenance of favour from that place.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#031">Job 34:31</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_031">job 34:31</a></font></span></p>Surely it is meet (z) to be said unto God, I have borne [chastisement], I will not offend [any more]: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(z) It only belongs to God to moderate his corrections, and not to man.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#032">Job 34:32</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_032">job 34:32</a></font></span></p>(a) [That which] I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Thus Elihu speaks in the person of God, as it were mocking Job, because he would be wiser than God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#033">Job 34:33</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_033">job 34:33</a></font></span></p>[Should it be] according to (b) thy mind? he will recompense (c) it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Will God use your counsel in doing his works? 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(c) Thus he speaks in the person of God, as though Job should chose and refuse affliction at his pleasure.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#036">Job 34:36</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_036">job 34:36</a></font></span></p>My desire [is that] Job may be (d) tried unto the end because of [his] answers for wicked men. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) That he may speak as much as he can, that we may answer him and all the wicked that will use such arguments.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#037">Job 34:37</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_037">job 34:37</a></font></span></p>For he (e) addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth [his hands] among us, and multiplieth his words against God. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) He stands stubbornly to the maintenance of his cause.
