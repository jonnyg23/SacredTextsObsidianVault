But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not (b) countervail the king's damage.

 <p>
 </p><p>(c) His conscience accused him that as he had conspired the death of innocents, so the vengeance of God would fall on him for the same.

Then the king said, Hang him thereon.
