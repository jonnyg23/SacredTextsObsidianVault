 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">hab 3:1</a></font></span></p>A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet (a) upon Shigionoth. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) "upon Shigionoth" or "for the ignorance". The prophet instructs his people to pray to God, not only because of their great sins, but also for those they had committed in ignorance.

 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Thus the people were afraid when they heard God's threatenings, and prayed. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(c) That is, the state of your Church which is now ready to perish, before it comes to half a perfect age, which would be under Christ.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#003">Habakkuk 3:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">hab 3:3</a></font></span></p>God came from (d) Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Teman and Paran were near Sinai, where the Law was given: by which is signified that his deliverance was as present now as it was then.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#004">Habakkuk 3:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">hab 3:4</a></font></span></p>And [his] brightness was as the light; (e) he had horns [coming] out of his hand: and there [was] the hiding of his power. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) By which is meant a power that was joined with his brightness, which was hidden to the rest of the world, but was revealed at Mount Sinai to his people; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#016">Psa 31:16</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#006">Habakkuk 3:6</a></p>

 <p>
 </p><p>(g) The iniquity of the king of Syria in vexing your people was made manifest by your judgment, to the comfort of your Church, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#010">Jdg 5:10</a>), and also of the Midianites, who destroyed themselves, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#022">Jdg 7:22</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">hab 3:8</a></font></span></p>Was the LORD displeased against the (h) rivers? [was] thy anger against the rivers? [was] thy wrath against the sea, that thou didst ride (i) upon thy horses [and] thy chariots of salvation? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Meaning that God was not angry with the waters, but that by this means he would destroy his enemies, and deliver his Church.

Selah. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(q) Signifying that there is no salvation, except by Christ. 
 </p><p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">hab 3:14</a></font></span></p>Thou didst (s) strike through with his staffs the head of his villages: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their rejoicing [was] as to devour the poor secretly. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(s) God destroyed his enemies both great and small with their own weapons, though they were ever so fierce against his Church.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#016">Habakkuk 3:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">hab 3:16</a></font></span></p>When I (t) heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I might rest in (u) the day of trouble: when he cometh up (x) to the people, he will invade them with his troops. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(t) He returns to that which he spoke as in, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#002">Hab 3:2</a>) and shows how he was afraid of God's judgments. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(u) He shows that the faithful can never have true rest, except that which they feel before the weight of God's judgments. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(x) That is, the enemy, but the godly will be quiet, knowing that all things will turn to good for them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#018">Habakkuk 3:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">hab 3:18</a></font></span></p>Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy (y) in the God of my salvation.
