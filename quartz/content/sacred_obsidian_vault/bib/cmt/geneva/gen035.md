 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#001">Genesis 35:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">gen 35:1</a></font></span></p>And (a) God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) God is ever at hand to comfort his people in their troubles.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#002">Genesis 35:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">gen 35:2</a></font></span></p>Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that [were] with him, Put away the strange gods that [are] among you, and be (b) clean, and change your garments: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) That by this outward act they should show their inward repentance.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#004">Genesis 35:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">gen 35:4</a></font></span></p>And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which [were] in their hand, and [all their] (c) earrings which [were] in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which [was] by Shechem. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) For in this was some sign of superstition, as in tablets and Agnus deis (a cake of wax, stamped with a lamb bearing a cross or flag, that has been blessed by the Pope).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#005">Genesis 35:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">gen 35:5</a></font></span></p>And they journeyed: and the (d) terror of God was upon the cities that [were] round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Thus, despite the inconvenience that came before, God delivered Jacob.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#013">Genesis 35:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">gen 35:13</a></font></span></p>And God (e) went up from him in the place where he talked with him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) As God is said to descend, when he shows some sign of his presence: so he is said to ascend when a vision is ended.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#016">Genesis 35:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">gen 35:16</a></font></span></p>And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a (f) little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) The Hebrew word signifies as much ground as one can cover from resting point to resting point, which is taken for half a days journey.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#020">Genesis 35:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">gen 35:20</a></font></span></p>And Jacob set a (g) pillar upon her grave: that [is] the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) The ancient fathers used this ceremony to testify their hope of the resurrection to come, which was not generally revealed.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#022">Genesis 35:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">gen 35:22</a></font></span></p>And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and (h) lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard [it]. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) This teaches that the fathers were not chosen for their merits, but only by God's mercies, whose election was not changed by their faults.
