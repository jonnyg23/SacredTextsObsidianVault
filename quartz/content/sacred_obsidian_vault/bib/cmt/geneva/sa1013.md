 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#001">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">sa1 13:1</a></font></span></p>Saul reigned (a) one year; and when he had reigned (b) two years over Israel, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) While these things were done. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) Before he took upon himself the state of a king. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#003">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">sa1 13:3</a></font></span></p>And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that [was] in (c) Geba, and the Philistines heard [of it]. And Saul blew the (d) trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Of Kirjath-jearim, where the ark was, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#005">Sa1 10:5</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(d) That everyone should prepare themselves to fight. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#005">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">sa1 13:5</a></font></span></p>And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which [is] on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from (e) Bethaven. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Which was also called Beth-el, in the tribe of Benjamin. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#007">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">sa1 13:7</a></font></span></p>And [some of] the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of (f) Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he [was] yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Where the two tribes and the half remained. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#008">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">sa1 13:8</a></font></span></p>And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel [had appointed]: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were (g) scattered from him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Thinking that the absence of the prophet was a sign, that they would lose the victory. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#011">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">sa1 13:11</a></font></span></p>And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were (h) scattered from me, and [that] thou camest not within the days appointed, and [that] the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Though these causes seem sufficient in man's judgment: yet because they had not the word of God, they turned to his destruction. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#013">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">sa1 13:13</a></font></span></p>And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy (i) God, which he commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) Who willed you to obey him, and rest on the words spoken by his prophet. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#014">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">sa1 13:14</a></font></span></p>But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him a (k) man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him [to be] captain over his people, because thou hast not kept [that] which the LORD commanded thee. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) That is, David. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#015">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">sa1 13:15</a></font></span></p>And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto (l) Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people [that were] present with him, about six hundred men. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) And went to his city Ramah. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#018">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">sa1 13:18</a></font></span></p>And another company turned the way [to] Bethhoron: and (m) another company turned [to] the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) So that to man's judgment these three armies would have overrun the whole country. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#022">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">sa1 13:22</a></font></span></p>So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither (n) sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that [were] with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(n) To declare that the victory only came from God, and not by their force.
