 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#001">Genesis 48:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">gen 48:1</a></font></span></p>And it came to pass after these things, that [one] told Joseph, Behold, thy father [is] sick: and he took with him his (a) two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Joseph valued his children being received into Jacob's family, which was the Church of God, more than enjoying all the treasures of Egypt.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#004">Genesis 48:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">gen 48:4</a></font></span></p>And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee [for] an (b) everlasting possession. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Which is true in the carnal Israel until the coming of Christ, and in the spiritual forever.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#009">Genesis 48:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">gen 48:9</a></font></span></p>And Joseph said unto his father, They [are] my sons, whom (c) God hath given me in this [place]. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) The faithful acknowledge all benefits come from God's free mercy.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#014">Genesis 48:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">gen 48:14</a></font></span></p>And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid [it] upon (d) Ephraim's head, who [was] the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh [was] the firstborn. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) God's judgments are often contrary to man's and he prefers what man despises.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#016">Genesis 48:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">gen 48:16</a></font></span></p>The (e) Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my (f) name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) This angel must be understood to be Christ, as in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#013">Gen 31:13</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#001">Gen 32:1</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(f) Let them be taken as my children.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#017">Genesis 48:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">gen 48:17</a></font></span></p>And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it (g) displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Joseph fails by binding God's grace to the order of nature.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#020">Genesis 48:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">gen 48:20</a></font></span></p>And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as (h) Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) In whom God's graces should manifestly appear.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#021">Genesis 48:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">gen 48:21</a></font></span></p>And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of (i) your fathers. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) Which they had by faith in the promise.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#022">Genesis 48:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">gen 48:22</a></font></span></p>Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which (k) I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) By my children whom God spared for my sake.
