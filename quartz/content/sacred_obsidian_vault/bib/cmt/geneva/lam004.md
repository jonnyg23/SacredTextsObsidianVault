 <p>
 </p><p>(a) By the gold he means the princes, as by the stones he understands the priests.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#002">Lamentations 4:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">lam 4:2</a></font></span></p>The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they esteemed as earthen (b) pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!

 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Though the dragons are cruel, yet they pity their young, and nourish them, which Jerusalem does not do. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(d) The women forsake their children as the ostrich does her eggs, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#017">Job 39:17</a>).

 <p>
 </p><p>(e) They who were before most in God's favour are now in greatest abomination to him.

 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Some refer this to the blind men who as they went, stumbled on the blood, of which the city was full. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(i) Meaning the heathen who came to destroy them could not abide them.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">lam 4:16</a></font></span></p>The anger of the LORD hath divided them; he will no longer regard them: (k) they respected not the persons of the priests, they favoured not the elders. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) That is, the enemies.

 <p>
 </p><p>(l) He shows two principal causes for their destruction: their cruelty and their vain confidence in man: for they trusted in the help of the Egyptians.

 <p>
 </p><p>(o) He comforts the Church because after seventy years their sorrows will have an end while the wicked would be tormented for ever.
