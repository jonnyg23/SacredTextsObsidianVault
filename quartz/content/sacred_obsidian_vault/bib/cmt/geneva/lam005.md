 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">lam 5:1</a></font></span></p>Remember, O LORD, what is come upon us: (a) consider, and behold our reproach. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) This prayer as is thought, was made when some of the people were carried away captive, others such as the poorest remained, and some went into Egypt and other places for comfort, though it seems that the prophet foreseeing their miseries to come, thus prayed.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#004">Lamentations 5:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">lam 5:4</a></font></span></p>We have drank our (b) water for money; our wood is sold to us. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Meaning their extreme servitude and bondage.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#006">Lamentations 5:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">lam 5:6</a></font></span></p>We have given the (c) hand [to] the Egyptians, [and to] the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) We are joined in league and amity with them, or have submitted ourselves to them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#007">Lamentations 5:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">lam 5:7</a></font></span></p>Our fathers have sinned, [and are] not; and we have borne (d) their iniquities. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) As our fathers have been punished for their sins: so we that are guilty of the same sins are punished.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#009">Lamentations 5:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">lam 5:9</a></font></span></p>We procured our bread with [the peril of] our lives because of the sword (e) of the wilderness. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Because of the enemy that came from the wilderness and would not suffer us to go and seek our necessary food.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#012">Lamentations 5:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">lam 5:12</a></font></span></p>Princes were hung up by (f) their hand: the faces of elders were not honoured. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) That is, by the enemies hand.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#013">Lamentations 5:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">lam 5:13</a></font></span></p>They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under (g) the wood. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Their slavery was so great, that they were not able to abide it.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#014">Lamentations 5:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">lam 5:14</a></font></span></p>The elders have ceased from the (h) gate, the young men from their music. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) There were no more laws nor form of commonwealth.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#017">Lamentations 5:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">lam 5:17</a></font></span></p>For this our heart is faint; for these [things] our (i) eyes are dim. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) With weeping.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#019">Lamentations 5:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">lam 5:19</a></font></span></p>Thou, O LORD, remainest for (k) ever; thy throne from generation to generation. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) And therefore your covenant and mercies can never fail.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">lam 5:21</a></font></span></p>(l) Turn thou us to thee, O LORD, and we shall be turned; renew our days as of old. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) By which is declared that it is not in man's power to turn to God, but is only his work to convert us, and thus God works in us before we can turn to him, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#018">Jer 31:18</a>).
