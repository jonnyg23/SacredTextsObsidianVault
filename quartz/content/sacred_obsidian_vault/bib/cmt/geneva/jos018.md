 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#001">Joshua 18:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">jos 18:1</a></font></span></p>And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh, and set up the (a) tabernacle of the congregation there. And the land was subdued before them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) For they had now removed it from Gilgal, and set it up in Shiloh.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#002">Joshua 18:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">jos 18:2</a></font></span></p>And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes, (b) which had not yet received their inheritance. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) As Eleazar, Joshua, and the heads of the tribes had done to Judah, Ephraim, and half of Manasseh.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#004">Joshua 18:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">jos 18:4</a></font></span></p>Give out from among you three men for [each] tribe: and I will send them, and they shall rise, and go through the land, and describe it according to (c) the inheritance of them; and they shall come [again] to me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) That is, into seven portions, one to every tribe.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#005">Joshua 18:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">jos 18:5</a></font></span></p>And they shall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall abide in their coast on the south, and the house of Joseph shall (d) abide in their coasts on the north. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) For these had their inheritance already appointed.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#006">Joshua 18:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">jos 18:6</a></font></span></p>Ye shall therefore describe the land [into] seven parts, and bring [the description] hither to me, that I may cast lots for you here before the (e) LORD our God. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Before the ark of the Lord.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#007">Joshua 18:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">jos 18:7</a></font></span></p>But the Levites have no part among you; for the (f) priesthood of the LORD [is] their inheritance: and Gad, and Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) That is, the sacrifices and offerings, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#014">Jos 13:14</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#008">Joshua 18:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">jos 18:8</a></font></span></p>And the men arose, and went away: and Joshua charged them that went to (g) describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land, and describe it, and come again to me, that I may here cast lots for you before the LORD in Shiloh. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) By writing the names of every country and city.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#010">Joshua 18:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">jos 18:10</a></font></span></p>And Joshua (h) cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD: and there Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel according to their divisions. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) That everyone should be content with God's appointment.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#011">Joshua 18:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">jos 18:11</a></font></span></p>And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families: and the coast of their lot came forth (i) between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) Their inheritance bordered on Judah and Joseph.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#013">Joshua 18:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">jos 18:13</a></font></span></p>And the border went over from thence toward Luz, to the side of Luz, which [is] (k) Bethel, southward; and the border descended to Atarothadar, near the hill that [lieth] on the south side of the nether Bethhoron. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) Which was in the tribe of Ephraim: another Bethel was in the tribe of Benjamin.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#017">Joshua 18:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">jos 18:17</a></font></span></p>And was drawn from the north, and went forth to (l) Enshemesh, and went forth toward Geliloth, which [is] over against the going up of Adummim, and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) Which is in the tribe of Ephraim.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#019">Joshua 18:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">jos 18:19</a></font></span></p>And the border passed along to the side of Bethhoglah northward: and the outgoings of the border were at the north bay of the salt sea at the south (m) end of Jordan: this [was] the south coast. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) To the very straight, where the river runs into the Salt sea.

This [is] the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their families. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(n) Which was not completely in the tribe of Benjamin, but part of it was also in the tribe of Judah.
