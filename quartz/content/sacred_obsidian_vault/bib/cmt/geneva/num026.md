 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Which came because of their whoredom and idolatry.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#003">Numbers 26:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">num 26:3</a></font></span></p>And Moses and Eleazar the priest spake with them in the plains of Moab by Jordan (b) [near] Jericho, saying,

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">num 26:9</a></font></span></p>And the sons of Eliab; Nemuel, and Dathan, and Abiram. This [is that] Dathan and Abiram, [which were] famous in the congregation, who strove against Moses and against Aaron in the (c) company of Korah, when they strove against the LORD: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) In that rebellion of which Korah was head.

 <p>
 </p><p>(d) That is, as an example that others should not complain and rebel against God's ministers.
