 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#001">Ecclesiastes 8:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">ecc 8:1</a></font></span></p>Who [is] as the wise [man]? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? a man's wisdom maketh his face (a) to shine, and (b) the boldness of his face shall be changed. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) That is, gets him favour and prosperity. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) While before he was proud and arrogant, he will become humble and meek.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#002">Ecclesiastes 8:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">ecc 8:2</a></font></span></p>I [counsel thee] to keep the king's (c) commandment, and [that] in regard of the oath of God. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) That is, that you obey the king and keep the oath that you have made for the same cause.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#003">Ecclesiastes 8:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">ecc 8:3</a></font></span></p>(d) Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he doeth whatever pleaseth him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Do not withdraw from yourself lightly from the obedience of your prince.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#005">Ecclesiastes 8:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">ecc 8:5</a></font></span></p>He who keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man's heart discerneth both (e) time and judgment. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) That is, when time is to obey, and how far he should obey.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#006">Ecclesiastes 8:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">ecc 8:6</a></font></span></p>Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the (f) misery of man [is] great upon him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Man by himself is miserable, and therefore should do nothing to increase the same, but to work all things by wisdom and counsel.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#008">Ecclesiastes 8:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">ecc 8:8</a></font></span></p>[There is] no man that hath power (g) over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither [hath he] power in the day of death: and [there is] no discharge in [that] war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Man has no power to save his own life and therefore must not rashly cast himself into danger.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#009">Ecclesiastes 8:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">ecc 8:9</a></font></span></p>All this have I seen, and applied my heart to every work that is done under the sun: [there is] a time in which one man ruleth over another to his own (h) hurt. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) As comes often to tyrants and wicked rulers.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#010">Ecclesiastes 8:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">ecc 8:10</a></font></span></p>And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and (i) gone from the (k) place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this [is] also vanity. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) That is, others as wicked as they. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(k) They who feared God and worshipped him as he had appointed.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#011">Ecclesiastes 8:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">ecc 8:11</a></font></span></p>Because sentence against an evil work is not (l) executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) Where justice is delayed, there sin reigns.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#014">Ecclesiastes 8:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">ecc 8:14</a></font></span></p>There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there are just [men], to whom it happeneth according to the (m) work of the wicked; again, there are wicked [men], to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also [is] vanity. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) Who are punished as though they were wicked, as in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#017">Ecc 7:17</a>)  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#015">Ecclesiastes 8:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">ecc 8:15</a></font></span></p>Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than (n) to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun.
