 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#002">Exodus 10:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">exo 10:2</a></font></span></p>And that thou mayest tell in the (a) ears of thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I [am] the LORD. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) The miracles would be so great, that they would be spoken of forever: where also we see the duty of parents toward their children.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#003">Exodus 10:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">exo 10:3</a></font></span></p>And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse (b) to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) The purpose of affliction is that we humble ourselves with true repentance under the hand of God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#007">Exodus 10:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">exo 10:7</a></font></span></p>And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a (c) snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Meaning, the occasion of all these evils: so are the godly ever charged as Elijah was by Ahab.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#010">Exodus 10:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">exo 10:10</a></font></span></p>And he said unto them, Let (d) the LORD be so with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look [to it]; for (e) evil [is] before you. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) That is, I hope the degree of affection that the Lord has for you is no more than the degree to which I want to let you go. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(e) Punishment is prepared for you. Some read, "You intend some mischief".  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#016">Exodus 10:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">exo 10:16</a></font></span></p>Then Pharaoh called for (f) Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) The wicked in their misery seek God's ministers for help, even though they hate and detest them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#019">Exodus 10:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">exo 10:19</a></font></span></p>And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts, and cast them into the (g) Red sea; there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) The water seemed red, because the sand or gravel is red: the Hebrews call it the Sea of bulrushes.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#021">Exodus 10:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">exo 10:21</a></font></span></p>And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness [which] may be (h) felt. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Because it was so thick.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#026">Exodus 10:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">exo 10:26</a></font></span></p>Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an (i) hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we know not (k) with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) The ministers of God should not yield one iota to the wicked, in regards to their mission. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(k) That is, with what beasts, or how many.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#028">Exodus 10:28</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_028">exo 10:28</a></font></span></p>And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in [that] day thou seest my face thou shalt (l) die. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) Though earlier he admitted Moses was just, yet again in his own heart he threatened to put him to death.
