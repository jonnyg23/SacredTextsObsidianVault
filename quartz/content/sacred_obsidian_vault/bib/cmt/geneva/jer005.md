 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#001">Jeremiah 5:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">jer 5:1</a></font></span></p>Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in its broad places, if ye can find a man, if there is [any] that executeth judgment, that seeketh the truth; and I will pardon (a) it. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) That is, the city.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#002">Jeremiah 5:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">jer 5:2</a></font></span></p>And though they say, The (b) LORD liveth; surely they swear falsely. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Though they pretend religion and holiness, yet all is but hypocrisy: for under this kind of swearing is contained the true religion.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#003">Jeremiah 5:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">jer 5:3</a></font></span></p>O LORD, [are] not thy eyes upon the (c) truth? thou hast (d) stricken them, but they have not grieved; thou hast consumed them, [but] they have refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a rock; they have refused to return. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Do you not love uprightness and faithful dealing? 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(d) You have often punished them, but all is in vain, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#013">Isa 9:13</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#005">Jeremiah 5:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">jer 5:5</a></font></span></p>I will go to the (e) great men, and will speak to them; for they have known the way of the LORD, [and] the judgment of their God: but these have altogether broken the yoke, [and] burst the bonds. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) He speaks this to the reproach of them who would govern and teach others, and yet are farther out of the way than the simple people.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#006">Jeremiah 5:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">jer 5:6</a></font></span></p>Wherefore a (f) lion from the forest shall slay them, [and] a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over their cities: every one that goeth out from there shall be torn in pieces: because their transgressions are many, [and] their backslidings are increased. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Meaning, Nebuchadnezzar and his army.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#007">Jeremiah 5:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">jer 5:7</a></font></span></p>How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have forsaken me, and (g) sworn by [them that are] no gods: when I had fed them to the full, then they committed adultery, and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots' houses. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) He shows that to swear by anything other than by God is to forsake him.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#010">Jeremiah 5:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">jer 5:10</a></font></span></p>(h) Go ye up upon her walls, and destroy; but make not a full end: (i) take away her battlements; for they [are] not the LORD'S. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) He commands the Babylonians and enemies to destroy them. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(i) Read (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#027">Jer 4:27</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">jer 5:12</a></font></span></p>They have (k) lied about the LORD, and said, [It is] not he; neither shall evil come upon us; neither shall we see sword nor famine: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) Because they gave no credit to the words of his prophets, as in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#015">Isa 28:15</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#013">Jeremiah 5:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">jer 5:13</a></font></span></p>And the prophets shall become (l) wind, and the word [is] (m) not in them: thus shall it be done to them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) Their words will be of no effect, but vain. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(m) They are not sent from the Lord, and therefore that which they threaten to us will come on them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#014">Jeremiah 5:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">jer 5:14</a></font></span></p>Wherefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, Because ye speak this word, behold, I will make my words in (n) thy mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them.

 <p>
 </p><p>(o) That is, the Babylonians and Chaldeans.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#016">Jeremiah 5:16</a></p>

 <p>
 </p><p>(p) Who will kill many with their arrows.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#018">Jeremiah 5:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">jer 5:18</a></font></span></p>Nevertheless in those days, saith the LORD, I will not make a full end with (q) you. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(q) Here the Lord declares his unspeakable favour toward his Church, as in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#027">Jer 4:27</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#019">Jeremiah 5:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">jer 5:19</a></font></span></p>And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Why doeth the LORD our God all these [things] to us? then shalt (r) thou answer them, As ye have forsaken me, and served foreign gods in your land, so shall ye serve strangers in a land [that is] not yours. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(r) Meaning, the prophet Jeremiah.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#025">Jeremiah 5:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">jer 5:25</a></font></span></p>Your (s) iniquities have turned away these [things], and your sins have withheld good [things] from you. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(s) If there is any stay, that we receive not God's blessings in abundance, we must consider that it is for our own iniquities, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#001">Isa 59:1-2</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#028">Jeremiah 5:28</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_028">jer 5:28</a></font></span></p>They have become fat, they shine: yea, they exceed the deeds of the wicked: they judge not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, yet they (t) prosper; and the right of the needy do they not judge. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(t) They feel not the plague of God for it.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#031">Jeremiah 5:31</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_031">jer 5:31</a></font></span></p>The (u) prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love [to have it] so: and what will ye do in its end?
