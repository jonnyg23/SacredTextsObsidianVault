 <p>
 </p><p>(a) See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#001">Isa 13:1</a> 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) The chief city by which the whole country was meant.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">isa 15:2</a></font></span></p>(c) He is gone up to Bajith, and to Dibon, the high places, to weep: Moab shall wail over (d) Nebo, and over Medeba: on all (e) their heads [shall be] baldness, [and] every beard shorn. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) The Moabites will flee to their idols for comfort but it will be too late. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(d) Which were cites of Moab. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(e) For as in the west parts the people used to let their hair grow long when they mourned, so in the East part they cut it off.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#005">Isaiah 15:5</a></p>

 <p>
 </p><p>(f) The prophet speaks this in the person of the Moabites: or as one who felt the great judgment of God that God would come on them. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(g) Meaning that it was a city that always lived in pleasure and never felt sorrow. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(h) He describes the miserable dissipation and flight of the Moabites.

 <p>
 </p><p>(k) Of them who are slain. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(l) So that by no means would they escape the hand of God: thus will God punish the enemies of his Church.
