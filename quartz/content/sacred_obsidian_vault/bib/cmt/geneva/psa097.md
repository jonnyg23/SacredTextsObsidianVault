 <p>
 </p><p>(a) He shows that where God reigns, there is all happiness and spiritual joy. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) For the gospel will not only be preached in Judea, but through all isles and countries.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#002">Psalms 97:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">psa 97:2</a></font></span></p>(c) Clouds and darkness [are] round about him: righteousness and judgment [are] the habitation of his throne. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) He is thus described to keep his enemies in fear, who commonly contemn God's power.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#004">Psalms 97:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">psa 97:4</a></font></span></p>His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and (d) trembled. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) This fear does not bring the wicked to true obedience, but makes them run away from God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#007">Psalms 97:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">psa 97:7</a></font></span></p>(e) Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: worship him, (f) all [ye] gods. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) He signifies that God's judgments are ready to destroy the idolatry. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(f) Let all who are esteemed in the world fall down before him.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#008">Psalms 97:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">psa 97:8</a></font></span></p>Zion heard, and was glad; and the (g) daughters of Judah rejoiced because of thy judgments, O LORD. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) The Jews will have opportunity to rejoice that the Gentiles are made partakers with them of God's favour.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#010">Psalms 97:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">psa 97:10</a></font></span></p>Ye that (h) love the LORD, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) He requires two things from his children: the one that they detest vice, the other, that they put their trust in God for their deliverance.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#011">Psalms 97:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">psa 97:11</a></font></span></p>(i) Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) Though God's deliverance does not appear suddenly, yet it is sown and laid up in store for them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#012">Psalms 97:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">psa 97:12</a></font></span></p>Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks at the (k) remembrance of his holiness. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) Be mindful of his benefits and only trust in his defence.
