 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#001">Exodus 7:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">exo 7:1</a></font></span></p>And the LORD said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a (a) god to Pharaoh: and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) I have given you power and authority to speak in my name and to execute my judgments on him.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#004">Exodus 7:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">exo 7:4</a></font></span></p>But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, [and] my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great (b) judgments. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) To strengthen Moses' faith, God promises again to punish most severely the oppression of his Church.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#007">Exodus 7:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">exo 7:7</a></font></span></p>And Moses [was] (c) fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Moses lived in affliction and banishment forty years before he commanded his office to deliver God's people.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#011">Exodus 7:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">exo 7:11</a></font></span></p>Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the (d) sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) It seems that these were Jannes and Jambres; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#008">Ti2 3:8</a>) so the wicked maliciously resist the truth of God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#015">Exodus 7:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">exo 7:15</a></font></span></p>Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by (e) the river's brink against he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) That is, the Nile river.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#021">Exodus 7:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">exo 7:21</a></font></span></p>And the (f) fish that [was] in the river died; and the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) To show that it was a true miracle, God plagued them in that which was most needed for the preservation of life.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#022">Exodus 7:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">exo 7:22</a></font></span></p>And the magicians of Egypt did (g) so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the LORD had said. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) In outward appearance, after the seven days were ended.
