 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">psa 8:2</a></font></span></p>Out of the mouth (a) of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Though the wicked would hide God's praises, yet the very babes are sufficient witnesses of the same.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#004">Psalms 8:4</a></p>

 <p>
 </p><p>(b) It was sufficient for him to have set forth his glory by the heavens, though he had not come so low as to man who is but dust.

 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Concerning his first creation.

 <p>
 </p><p>(d) By the temporal gifts of man's creation, he is led to consider the benefits which he has by his regeneration through Christ.
