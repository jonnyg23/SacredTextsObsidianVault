 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#001">Mark 2:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">mar 2:1</a></font></span></p>And (1) again he entered into Capernaum after [some] days; and it was noised that he was in the (a) house. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(1) By healing this man who was sick from paralysis Christ shows that men recover all their lost strength in him through faith alone. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(a) In the house where he used to remain: for he chose Capernaum to dwell in and left Nazareth.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#002">Mark 2:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">mar 2:2</a></font></span></p>And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive [them], no, not so much as (b) about the door: and he preached the word unto them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Neither the house nor the entry was able to hold them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#004">Mark 2:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">mar 2:4</a></font></span></p>And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken [it] up, they (c) let down the (d) bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) They broke up the upper part of the house which was made simply, and let down the man that was sick from paralysis into the lower part where Christ preached, for they could not come before Christ in any other way. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(d) The word signifies the poorest kind of bed, upon which men used to lay down at noon, and at such other times to refresh themselves; we call it a couch.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#006">Mark 2:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">mar 2:6</a></font></span></p>But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and (e) reasoning in their hearts, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) In their minds disputing upon the matter, arguing both sides.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#012">Mark 2:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">mar 2:12</a></font></span></p>And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all (f) amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Literally, "past themselves", or "out of their wit".  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#013">Mark 2:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">mar 2:13</a></font></span></p>(2) And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(2) The gospel offends the proud and saves the humble.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#014">Mark 2:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">mar 2:14</a></font></span></p>And as he passed by, he saw (g) Levi the [son] of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Matthew's other name.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#018">Mark 2:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">mar 2:18</a></font></span></p>(3) And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(3) The superstitious and hypocrites rashly put the sum of godliness in matters which do no matter, and are reprehended for three reasons. First, by not considering what every man's strength is able to bear, they rashly make all sorts of laws concerning such things, without any discretion.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#023">Mark 2:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">mar 2:23</a></font></span></p>(4) And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the (h) sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(4) Secondly, because they do not distinguish between the laws which God made concerning things, and the laws that they made concerning the same things, which are not at all based on the law. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(h) Literally, "on the Sabbaths", that is, on the holy days.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#026">Mark 2:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">mar 2:26</a></font></span></p>How he went into the house of God in the days of (i) Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) In (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#001">Sa1 21:1</a>) he is called Ahimelech and his son is called Abiathar, but by conferring other places it is plain that both of them had two names; see (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#006">Ch1 24:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#017">Sa2 8:17</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#029">Sa2 15:29</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#026">Kg1 2:26</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#018">Kg2 25:18</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#028">Mark 2:28</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_028">mar 2:28</a></font></span></p>Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the (k) sabbath. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) Has the sabbath day in his power, and may rule it as he desires.
