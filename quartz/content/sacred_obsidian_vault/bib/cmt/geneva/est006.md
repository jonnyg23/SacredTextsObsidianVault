 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#003">Esther 6:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">est 6:3</a></font></span></p>And the king said, What honour and dignity hath been done to Mordecai (a) for this? Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) For he thought it unworthy of his estate to receive a benefit and not reward it.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#004">Esther 6:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">est 6:4</a></font></span></p>And the king said, Who [is] in the court? Now Haman was come into the outward court of the king's house, to speak unto the king to (b) hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Thus while the wicked imagine the destruction of others, they themselves fall into the same pit.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#008">Esther 6:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">est 6:8</a></font></span></p>Let the royal apparel be brought which the king [useth] to wear, and the (c) horse that the king rideth upon, and the crown royal which is set upon his head: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Meaning by this that the king should make him next to himself as Joseph was known to be next to Pharaoh in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#043">Gen 41:43</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#013">Esther 6:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">est 6:13</a></font></span></p>And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every [thing] that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him, If Mordecai [be] of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against him, (d) but shalt surely fall before him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Thus God sometimes puts in the mouth of the very wicked to speak that thing which he has decreed shall come to pass.
