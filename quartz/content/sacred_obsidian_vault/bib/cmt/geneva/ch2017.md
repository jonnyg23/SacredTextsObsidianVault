 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">ch2 17:3</a></font></span></p>And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the (a) first ways of his father David, and sought not unto (b) Baalim; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) That is, his virtues meaning before he had committed with Bathsheba, and against Uriah. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) Did not seek help from strange Gods. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#006">2 Chronicles 17:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">ch2 17:6</a></font></span></p>And his heart was (c) lifted up in the ways of the LORD: moreover he took away the high places and groves out of Judah. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) He gave himself wholly to serve the Lord.

 <p>
 </p><p>(d) He knew it was in vain to profess religion, unless such were appointed who could instruct the people in the same, and had authority to put away all idolatry.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">ch2 17:10</a></font></span></p>And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that [were] round about Judah, so that they (e) made no war against Jehoshaphat. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Thus God prospers all who with a pure heart seek his glory, and keeps their enemies in fear, so that they are not able to execute their rage against them.

 <p>
 </p><p>(g) That is, they were at his ordinary guard.
