 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">num 14:3</a></font></span></p>And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be (b) a prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) To our enemies the Canaanites.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#005">Numbers 14:5</a></p>

 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#009">Numbers 14:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">num 14:9</a></font></span></p>Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they [are] (e) bread for us: their defence is departed from them, and the LORD [is] with us: fear them not. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) We shall easily overcome them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#010">Numbers 14:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">num 14:10</a></font></span></p>But all the congregation bade (f) stone them with stones. And the glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">num 14:20</a></font></span></p>And the LORD said, I have pardoned (h) according to thy word: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) In that he did not utterly destroy them, but allowed their children and certain others to enter.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#022">Numbers 14:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">num 14:22</a></font></span></p>Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these (i) ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) That is, various times and often.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#024">Numbers 14:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">num 14:24</a></font></span></p>But my servant Caleb, because he had another (k) spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) A meek and obedient spirit, and not rebellious.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#025">Numbers 14:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">num 14:25</a></font></span></p>(Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites (l) dwelt in the valley.) To morrow turn you, and get you into the (m) wilderness by the way of the Red sea. 
 <p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_034">num 14:34</a></font></span></p>After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, [even] forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, [even] forty years, and ye (p) shall know my breach of promise.

 <p>
 </p><p>(q) They confessed their sin in rebelling against God, but did not consider their offence in going up without God's commandment.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#044">Numbers 14:44</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_044">num 14:44</a></font></span></p>But they (r) presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the camp. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(r) They could not be stayed by any means.
