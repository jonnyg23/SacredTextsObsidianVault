 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#001">Job 24:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">job 24:1</a></font></span></p>Why, seeing times (a) are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his (b) days? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Thus Job speaks in his passions, and after the judgment of the flesh: that is, that he does not see the things that are done at times, nor yet has a peculiar care over all, because he does not punish the wicked or avenge the godly. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) When he punishes the wicked and rewards the good.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#004">Job 24:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">job 24:4</a></font></span></p>They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves (c) together. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) And for cruelty and oppression dare not show their faces.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#005">Job 24:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">job 24:5</a></font></span></p>Behold, [as] wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work; (d) rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness (e) [yieldeth] food for them [and] for [their] children. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) That is, spares diligence. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(e) He and his live by robbing and murdering.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#006">Job 24:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">job 24:6</a></font></span></p>They reap [every one] (f) his corn in the field: and they gather the (g) vintage of the wicked. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Meaning the poor man's. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(g) Signifying that one wicked man will not spoil another, but for necessity.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#008">Job 24:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">job 24:8</a></font></span></p>They are wet with the showers of the mountains, (h) and embrace the rock for want of a shelter. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) The poor are driven by the wicked into the rock and holes where they cannot lie dry for the rain.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#009">Job 24:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">job 24:9</a></font></span></p>They pluck the fatherless (i) from the breast, and take a pledge of (k) the poor. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) That is, they so pillage and plunder the poor widow that she cannot sustain herself that she may be able to nurse her baby.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#011">Job 24:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">job 24:11</a></font></span></p>[Which] make oil (l) within their walls, [and] tread [their] winepresses, and suffer thirst. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) In such places which are appointed for that purpose; meaning, that those who labour for the wicked, are pined for hunger.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#012">Job 24:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">job 24:12</a></font></span></p>Men (m) groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God (n) layeth not folly [to them]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) For the great oppression and extortion. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(n) Cry out and call for vengeance.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#013">Job 24:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">job 24:13</a></font></span></p>They are of those that rebel against the (p) light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(p) That is, God's word, because they are reproved by it.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#015">Job 24:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">job 24:15</a></font></span></p>The eye also of the (q) adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth [his] face. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(q) By these particular vices and the licence of it, he would prove that God did not punish the wicked and reward the just.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#018">Job 24:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">job 24:18</a></font></span></p>He [is] swift as the (r) waters; their (s) portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(r) He flees to the waters for his succour. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(s) They think that all the world is bent against them and dare not go by the highway.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#019">Job 24:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">job 24:19</a></font></span></p>Drought and heat consume the snow waters: [so doth] the grave [those which] (t) have sinned. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(t) As the dry ground is never full with waters, so will they never cease sinning till they come to the grave.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#020">Job 24:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">job 24:20</a></font></span></p>(u) The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(u) Though God tolerates the wicked for a time, yet their end will be vile destruction, and in this point Job commits to himself and shows his confidence.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#021">Job 24:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">job 24:21</a></font></span></p>He (x) evil entreateth the barren [that] beareth not: and doeth not good to the widow. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(x) He shows why the wicked will not be lamented, because he did not pity others.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#022">Job 24:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">job 24:22</a></font></span></p>He draweth also the (y) mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no [man] is sure of life. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(y) He declares that after the wicked have destroyed the weakest, they will do the same to the stranger, and therefore are justly punished by God's judgments.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#025">Job 24:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">job 24:25</a></font></span></p>And if [it be] not (z) [so] now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(z) That is, contrary to your reasoning no man can give perfect reasons for God's judgments, let me be reproved.
