 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#001">Hosea 3:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">hos 3:1</a></font></span></p>Then said the LORD unto me, (a) Go yet, love a woman beloved of [her] friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the LORD toward the children of Israel, who look to other gods, and (b) love flagons of wine. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) In this the Prophet represents the person of God, who loved his Church before he called her, and did not withdraw his love when she gave herself to idols. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) That is, gave themselves wholly to pleasure, and could not stop, as those that are given to drunkenness.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#002">Hosea 3:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">hos 3:2</a></font></span></p>So (c) I bought her to me for fifteen [pieces] of silver, and [for] an homer of barley, and an half homer of barley: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Yet I loved her and paid a small portion for her, lest she would have perceived the greatness of my love, and abused me, and not been under duty: for fifteen pieces of silver was but half the price of a slave; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#032">Exo 21:32</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#003">Hosea 3:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">hos 3:3</a></font></span></p>And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for (d) me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for [another] man: so [will] I also [be] for thee. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) I will try you a long time as in your widowhood, whether you will be mine or not.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#004">Hosea 3:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">hos 3:4</a></font></span></p>For the children of Israel shall (e) abide many days without a king, and without a (f) prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and [without] teraphim: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Meaning not only all the time of their captivity, but also until Christ. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(f) That is, they would neither have administration nor religion, and their idols also in which they put their confidence, would be destroyed.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005">Hosea 3:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">hos 3:5</a></font></span></p>Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the LORD their God, and (g) David their king; and shall fear the LORD and his goodness in the latter days. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) This is meant of Christ's kingdom, which was promised to David to be eternal; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#017">Psa 72:17</a>).
