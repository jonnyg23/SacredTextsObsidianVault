 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Which was a fountain at the foot of mount Zion, out of which ran a small river through the city: meaning, that they of Judah distrusting their own power which was small desired such power and riches as they saw in Syria and Israel.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#007">Isaiah 8:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">isa 8:7</a></font></span></p>Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of (h) the river, strong and many, [even] the king of Assyria, and all his glory: and he shall come up over all its channels, and go over all its banks:

 <p>
 </p><p>(i) It will be ready to drown them. 
 </p><p>

 <p>
 </p><p>(q) He will defend you who are his elect, and reject all the rest, meaning Christ against whom the Jews would stumble and fall, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#023">Luk 2:23</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#033">Rom 9:33</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#007">Pe1 2:7,8</a>).
