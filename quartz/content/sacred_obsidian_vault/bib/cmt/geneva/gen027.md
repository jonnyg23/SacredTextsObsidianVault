 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#004">Genesis 27:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">gen 27:4</a></font></span></p>And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring [it] to me, that I may eat; that my (a) soul may bless thee before I die. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) The carnal affection he had for his son made him forget what God spoke to his wife. (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#023">Gen 25:23</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#009">Genesis 27:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">gen 27:9</a></font></span></p>(b) Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as he loveth: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) This trickery is worthy of blame because she should have waited for God to perform his promise.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#013">Genesis 27:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">gen 27:13</a></font></span></p>And his mother said unto him, (c) Upon me [be] thy curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me [them]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) The assurance of God's decree made her bold.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#019">Genesis 27:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">gen 27:19</a></font></span></p>And Jacob said unto his father, (d) I [am] Esau thy firstborn; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Although Jacob was assured of this blessing by faith: yet he did evil to seek it by lies, even more because he abuses God's name through it.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#022">Genesis 27:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">gen 27:22</a></font></span></p>And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The (e) voice [is] Jacob's voice, but the hands [are] the hands of Esau. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) This declares that he suspected something, yet God would not have his decree altered.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#033">Genesis 27:33</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_033">gen 27:33</a></font></span></p>And Isaac (f) trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where [is] he that hath taken venison, and brought [it] me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, [and] he shall be blessed. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) In perceiving his error, by appointing his heir against God's sentence pronounced before.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#036">Genesis 27:36</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_036">gen 27:36</a></font></span></p>And he said, Is not he rightly named (g) Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) In (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#026">Gen 25:26</a>) he was so called because he held his brother by the heel, as though he would overthrow him: and therefore he is here called an overthrower, or deceiver.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#037">Genesis 27:37</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_037">gen 27:37</a></font></span></p>And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made 
 <p>
 </p><p>him (h) thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son? 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(h) For Isaac did this as he was the minister and prophet of God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#040">Genesis 27:40</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_040">gen 27:40</a></font></span></p>And (i) by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt (k) serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) Because your enemies will be all around you. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(k) Which was fulfilled in his posterity the Idumeans: who were tributaries for a time to Israel, and later came to freedom.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#041">Genesis 27:41</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_041">gen 27:41</a></font></span></p>And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; (l) then will I slay my brother Jacob. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) Hypocrites only abstain from doing evil for fear of men.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#042">Genesis 27:42</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_042">gen 27:42</a></font></span></p>And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, (m) as touching thee, doth comfort himself, [purposing] to kill thee. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) He hopes to recover his birthright by killing you.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#045">Genesis 27:45</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_045">gen 27:45</a></font></span></p>Until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget [that] which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be (n) deprived also of you both in one day? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(n) For the wicked son will kill the godly: and the plague of God will later come on the wicked son.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#046">Genesis 27:46</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_046">gen 27:46</a></font></span></p>And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the (o) daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these [which are] of the daughters of the land, (p) what good shall my life do me? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(o) Who were Esau's wives. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(p) By this she persuaded Isaac to agree to Jacob's leaving.
