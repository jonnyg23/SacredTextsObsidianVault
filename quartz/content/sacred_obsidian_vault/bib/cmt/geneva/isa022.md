 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Meaning, Judea, which was compassed about with mountains, and was called the valley of visions, because of the prophets, who were always there, whom they named Seers.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">isa 22:4</a></font></span></p>Therefore said I, Look away from me; I will weep (g) bitterly, labour not to comfort me, because of the plundering of the daughter of my people. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) He shows what is the duty of the godly, when God's plagues hang over the Church, and especially of the ministers, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#001">Jer 9:1</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">isa 22:5</a></font></span></p>For [it is] a day of trouble, and of treading down, and of perplexity by the Lord GOD of hosts in the valley of vision, breaking down the walls, and of (h) crying to the mountains. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) That is, the shout of the enemies whom God had appointed to destroy the city.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">isa 22:8</a></font></span></p>And he uncovered the (k) coverings of Judah, and thou didst look in that day to the armour of the house of the forest. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) The secret place where the armour was: that is, in the house of the forest, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#002">Kg1 7:2</a>).

 <p>
 </p><p>(l) You forfeited the ruinous places which were neglected in times of peace: meaning, the whole City, and the City of David, which was within the compass of the other.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#010">Isaiah 22:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">isa 22:10</a></font></span></p>And ye have numbered the houses (m) of Jerusalem, and the houses have ye broken down to fortify the wall.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">isa 22:11</a></font></span></p>Ye made also a ditch between the two walls for the (n) water of the old pool: but ye have not looked to (o) its maker, neither had respect to him that fashioned it long ago. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(n) To provide if need should be of water. 
 </p><p>

 <p>
 </p><p>(q) Because the Hebrew word also signifies one who nourishes and cherishes, there are those of the scholars who think that this wicked man nourished a secret friendship with the Assyrians and Egyptians to betray the Church and to provide for himself against all dangers: in the mean season he packed craftily, and got of the best offices into his hand under Hezekiah, ever aspiring to the highest.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#016">Isaiah 22:16</a></p>

 <p>
 </p><p>(t) Signifying that whatever dignity the wicked attain to, at length it will turn to the shame of those princes by whom they are preferred.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#020">Isaiah 22:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">isa 22:20</a></font></span></p>And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will (u) call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah: 
 <p>

 <p>
 </p><p>(y) I will establish him, and confirm him in his office, of this phrase read (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#009">Ezr 9:9</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">isa 22:24</a></font></span></p>And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father's house, the offspring and the issue, (z) all vessels of small quantity, from the vessels of cups, even to all the vessels of flagons.
