 <p>
 </p><p>(a) In respect to the rest of the world, and because he had a desire to serve God and live uprightly.

 <p>
 </p><p>(c) God compelled them to present themselves to Noah, as they did before to Adam, when he gave them names, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#019">Gen 2:19</a>).

 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Both the waters in the earth overflowed and also the clouds poured down.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#015">Genesis 7:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">gen 7:15</a></font></span></p>And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two (f) of all flesh, wherein [is] the breath of life.

 <p>
 </p><p>(g) So that God's secret power defended him against the rage of the mighty waters.

 <p>
 </p><p>(h) That is, by God.
