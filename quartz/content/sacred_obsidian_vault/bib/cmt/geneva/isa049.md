 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#001">Isaiah 49:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">isa 49:1</a></font></span></p>Listen, to me O isles; and hearken, ye people, from far; The LORD hath called (a) me from (b) the womb; from the body of my mother hath he made mention of my name. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) This is spoken in the person of Christ, to assure the faithful that these promises should come to pass: for they were all made in him and in him would be performed. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) This is meant of the time that Christ would be manifested to the world, as in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007">Psa 2:7</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#002">Isaiah 49:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">isa 49:2</a></font></span></p>And he hath made my mouth like a sharp (c) sword; in the shadow of his hand hath he (d) hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver hath he hid me; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) By the sword and shaft, he signifies the virtue and efficacy of Christ's doctrine. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(d) God has taken me to his protection and defence: this chiefly is meant of Christ, and may also be applied to the ministers of his word.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#003">Isaiah 49:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">isa 49:3</a></font></span></p>And said to me, Thou [art] my servant, O (e) Israel, in whom I will be glorified. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) By Israel is meant Christ, and all the body of the faithful, as the members and their head.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#004">Isaiah 49:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">isa 49:4</a></font></span></p>Then I said, I have (f) laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for nothing, and in vain: [yet] surely my judgment [is] with the LORD, and my work with my God. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Thus Christ in his members complains that his labour and preaching take no effect, yet he is contented that his doings are approved by God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#005">Isaiah 49:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">isa 49:5</a></font></span></p>And now, saith the LORD that formed me from the womb [to be] his servant, to bring Jacob again to him, Though Israel be not gathered, (g) yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the LORD, and my God shall be my strength. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Though the Jews refuse my doctrine, yet God will approve my ministry.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#006">Isaiah 49:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">isa 49:6</a></font></span></p>And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give (h) thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation to the end of the earth. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) To declare my gospel to the Gentiles, as in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#006">Isa 42:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#047">Act 13:47</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#032">Luk 2:32</a>).

 <p>
 </p><p>(i) Meaning, the Jews whom tyrants kept in bondage. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(k) The benefit of their deliverance will be so great, that great and small will acknowledge it, and revere God for it.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#008">Isaiah 49:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">isa 49:8</a></font></span></p>Thus saith the LORD, (l) In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of salvation have I helped thee: and I will preserve thee, and give (m) thee for a covenant of the people, to establish the (n) earth, to cause to inherit the desolate heritages; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) Thus he speaks of his Church when he would show his mercy toward it, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#002">Co2 6:2</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(m) Meaning, Christ alone. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(n) Signifying that before Christ renewed the earth by his word, there is nothing but confusion and disorder.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#009">Isaiah 49:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">isa 49:9</a></font></span></p>That thou mayest say to the (o) prisoners, Go forth; to them that [are] in darkness, Show yourselves. They shall feed in the ways, and their (p) pastures [shall be] in all high places. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(o) To them who are in the prison of sin and death. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(p) Being in Christ's protection, they will be safe against all dangers, and free from fear of the enemies.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">isa 49:10</a></font></span></p>They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun smite them: for he that hath mercy (q) on them shall lead them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(q) Meaning, that there would be nothing in their way from Babylon that would hinder or hurt them: but this is accomplished spiritually.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#012">Isaiah 49:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">isa 49:12</a></font></span></p>Behold, these shall come from far: and, lo, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of (r) Sinim. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(r) Meaning, the south country, so that Christ will deliver his from all the parts of the world.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#013">Isaiah 49:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">isa 49:13</a></font></span></p>Sing, O (s) heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing, O mountains: for the LORD hath comforted his people, and will have mercy upon his afflicted. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(s) Read (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#023">Isa 44:23</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">isa 49:14</a></font></span></p>But Zion said, The LORD hath (t) forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(t) He objects what the faithful might say in their long affliction and answers to comfort them with a most proper comparison and full of consolation.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#016">Isaiah 49:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">isa 49:16</a></font></span></p>Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of [my] (u) hands; thy (x) walls [are] continually before me.

 <p>

[As] I live, saith the LORD, thou shalt surely (z) clothe thee with them all, as with an ornament, and bind them [on thee], as a bride [doeth]. 
 <p>

 <p>
 </p><p>(a) He shows that Christ will not only gather this great number from the Jews but also from the Gentiles.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">isa 49:24</a></font></span></p>Shall the prey be (d) taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive delivered? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) He makes this as an objection as though the Chaldeans were strong, and had them in just possession.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">isa 49:25</a></font></span></p>But thus saith the LORD, (e) Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered: for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children.

 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#026">Isaiah 49:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">isa 49:26</a></font></span></p>And I will feed them that oppress thee with (f) their own flesh; and they shall be drunk with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh shall know that I the LORD [am] thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.
