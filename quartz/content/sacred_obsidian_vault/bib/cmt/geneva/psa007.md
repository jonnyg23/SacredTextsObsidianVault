 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">psa 7:3</a></font></span></p>O LORD my God, if I have done (b) this; if there be iniquity in my hands; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) With which Cush charges me.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#004">Psalms 7:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">psa 7:4</a></font></span></p>(c) If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:) 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) If I did not reverence Saul for affinities sake, and preserved his life, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#008">Sa1 26:8-9</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#005">Psalms 7:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">psa 7:5</a></font></span></p>Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take [it]; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine (d) honour in the dust. Selah. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Let me not only die, but be dishonoured forever.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#006">Psalms 7:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">psa 7:6</a></font></span></p>Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies: and awake for me [to] the (e) judgment [that] thou hast commanded. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) In promising me the kingdom.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#007">Psalms 7:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">psa 7:7</a></font></span></p>So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for their sakes therefore (f) return thou on high.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">psa 7:8</a></font></span></p>The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my (g) righteousness, and according to mine integrity [that is] in me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) As concerning my behaviour towards Saul and my enemies.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#009">Psalms 7:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">psa 7:9</a></font></span></p>Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the (h) hearts and reins. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Though they pretend a just cause against me, yet God will judge their hypocrisy.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#011">Psalms 7:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">psa 7:11</a></font></span></p>God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry [with the wicked] (i) every day.

 <p>
 </p><p>(k) Unless Saul changes his mind, I will die, for he has both the men and weapons to destroy me. Thus considering his great danger, he magnifies God's grace.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#017">Psalms 7:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">psa 7:17</a></font></span></p>I will praise the LORD according to his (l) righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) In faithfully keeping his promise to me.
