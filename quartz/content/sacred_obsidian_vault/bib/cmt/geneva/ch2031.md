 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">ch2 31:1</a></font></span></p>Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and (a) brake the images in pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the (b) children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) According to the commandment of the Lord, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#025">Deu 7:25</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#012">Jos 7:12</a>).

 <p>
 </p><p>(c) That is, in the temple where they assembled as in a tent.

 <p>
 </p><p>(d) The tithes and firstfruits for the maintenance of the priests and Levites. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(e) That their minds might not be entangled with provision of worldly things, but that they might wholly and cheerfully serve the Lord.

 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Which they had dedicated to the Lord by a vow.

 <p>
 </p><p>(h) They praised the Lord and prayed for all prosperity to his people. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#010">2 Chronicles 31:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">ch2 31:10</a></font></span></p>And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him, and said, Since [the people] began to bring the offerings into the house of the LORD, we have (i) had enough to eat, and have left plenty: for the LORD hath blessed his people; and that which is left [is] this great store. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) He shows that this plenteous liberality is expedient for the maintenance of the ministers and that God therefore prospers his people and increases by his blessing that which is given.

 <p>
 </p><p>(k) Who had also a portion and allowance in this distribution.

 <p>
 </p><p>(l) Meaning, that either by the faithful distribution of the officers, everyone had their part in the things that were offered, or else that their wives and children were relieved, because the Levites were faithful in their office, and so depended on them.
