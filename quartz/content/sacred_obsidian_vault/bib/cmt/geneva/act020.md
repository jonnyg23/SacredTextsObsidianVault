 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#001">Acts 20:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">act 20:1</a></font></span></p>And (1) after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto [him] the disciples, and embraced [them], and departed for to go into Macedonia. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(1) Paul departs from Ephesus by the consent of the church, not to be idle or at rest, but to take pains in another place.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#002">Acts 20:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">act 20:2</a></font></span></p>And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them (a) much exhortation, he came into Greece, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) For after so great trouble, there was need of much exhortation.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#003">Acts 20:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">act 20:3</a></font></span></p>(2) And [there] abode three months. And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(2) A perverse zeal is the guider and instructor to murderers: and we are not excluded by the wisdom of God to prevent the endeavours of wicked men.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#007">Acts 20:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">act 20:7</a></font></span></p>(3) And upon the (b) first [day] of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(3) Assemblies in the night-time cannot be justly condemned, neither should they be, when the cause is good. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) Literally, "the first day of the Sabbath", that is, upon the Lord's day: so that by this place, and by (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#002">Co1 16:2</a>) we properly understand that in those days the Christians habitually assembled themselves solemnly together upon that day.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#008">Acts 20:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">act 20:8</a></font></span></p>(4) And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(4) The devil, taking care to trouble the Church with a great offence, gives Paul a singular occasion to confirm the Gospel  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#016">Acts 20:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">act 20:16</a></font></span></p>(5) For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(5) Paul, an earnest and diligent follower of Christ, making haste to his bonds without any ceasing or stopping in his race, first of all as it were makes his testament, wherein he gives an account of his former life, defends the doctrine which he taught, and exhorts the pastors of the church to persevere and go forward with continuance in their office.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#017">Acts 20:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">act 20:17</a></font></span></p>And from (c) Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) According as the situation of these places is set forth, the distance between Ephesus and Miletus was almost 50 miles or 80 km.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#018">Acts 20:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">act 20:18</a></font></span></p>(6) And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(6) A graphic image of a true pastor.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#020">Acts 20:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">act 20:20</a></font></span></p>[And] how I kept (d) back nothing that was profitable [unto you], but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house to house, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) I did not refrain form speaking, neither did I conceal my motives in any way at all, either for fear or for wicked gain.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#022">Acts 20:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">act 20:22</a></font></span></p>(7) And now, behold, I go (e) bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(7) He testifies that he goes to his imprisonment by the commandment of God. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(e) He calls the guiding direction of the Holy Spirit, who forced him to take his journey to Jerusalem, the bond of the Sprit, whom he followed with all his heart.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#026">Acts 20:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">act 20:26</a></font></span></p>Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I [am] (f) pure from the blood of all [men]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) If you perish, yet there will fault with me. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#006">Act 18:6</a>  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#027">Acts 20:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">act 20:27</a></font></span></p>(8) For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(8) The doctrine of the apostles is most perfect and absolute.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028">Acts 20:28</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_028">act 20:28</a></font></span></p>Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to (g) feed the church of God, which (h) he hath purchased with (i) his own blood. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) To keep it, to feed and govern it. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(h) A notable sentence for Christ's Godhead: which shows plainly in his person, how that by reason of the joining together of the two natures in his own person, that which is proper to one is spoken of the other, being taken as deriving from one another, and not in the original: which in old time the godly fathers termed a communicating or fellowship of properties or attributes, that is to say, a making common of that to two, which belongs but to one. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(i) The words "his own" show forth the excellency of that blood.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#029">Acts 20:29</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">act 20:29</a></font></span></p>(9) For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(9) A prophecy of pastors that would immediately degenerate into wolves, against those who boast and brag only of a succession of persons.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#030">Acts 20:30</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_030">act 20:30</a></font></span></p>Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to (k) draw away disciples after them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) This is great misery, to want the presence of such a shepherd, but it is a greater misery to have wolves enter in.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#032">Acts 20:32</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_032">act 20:32</a></font></span></p>(10) And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an (l) inheritance among all them which are sanctified. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(10) The power of God, and his free promises revealed in his word, are the props and upholders of the ministry of the Gospel. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(l) As children, and therefore an inheritance of free love and good will.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#033">Acts 20:33</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_033">act 20:33</a></font></span></p>(11) I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(11) Pastors must before all things beware of covetousness.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#035">Acts 20:35</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_035">act 20:35</a></font></span></p>I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought (m) to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) As it were by reaching out the hand to those who otherwise are about to slip and fall away, and so to steady them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#037">Acts 20:37</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_037">act 20:37</a></font></span></p>(12) And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(12) The Gospel does not take away natural affections, but rules and bridles them in good order.
