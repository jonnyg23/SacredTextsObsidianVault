 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">mic 7:1</a></font></span></p>Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the (a) summer fruits, as the grapegleanings of the vintage: [there is] no cluster to eat: my soul desired the firstripe fruit. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) The Prophet takes upon himself the voice of the earth, which complains that all her fruits are gone, so that none are left: that is, that there is no godly man remaining, for all are given to cruelty and deceit, so that none spares his own brother.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#002">Micah 7:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">mic 7:2</a></font></span></p>The good [man] is perished out of the earth: and [there is] none upright among men: (b) they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) He shows that the prince, the judge, and the rich man are all linked together to do evil, and to disguise the deeds of one another.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#003">Micah 7:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">mic 7:3</a></font></span></p>That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince asketh, and the judge [asketh] for a reward; and the (c) great [man], he uttereth his mischievous desire: so (d) they wrap it up. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) That is, the rich man that is able to give money, abstains from no wickedness or injury. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(d) These men agree among themselves, and conspire with one another to do evil.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#004">Micah 7:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">mic 7:4</a></font></span></p>The best of them [is] as (e) a brier: the most upright [is sharper] than a thorn hedge: the day of (f) thy watchmen [and] thy visitation cometh; now shall be their perplexity. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) They that are of most estimation and are counted most honest among them, are but thorns and briers to prick.
