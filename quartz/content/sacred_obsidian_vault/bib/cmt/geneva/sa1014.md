 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#001">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">sa1 14:1</a></font></span></p>Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armour, (a) Come, and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison, that [is] on the other side. But he told not his father. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) By this example God declared to Israel that the victory did not consist in multitude or armour, but only because of his grace. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#006">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">sa1 14:6</a></font></span></p>And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these (b) uncircumcised: it may be that the LORD will work for us: for [there is] no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) That is, the Philistines. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#007">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">sa1 14:7</a></font></span></p>And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that [is] in thine heart: turn thee; behold, (c) I [am] with thee according to thy heart. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) I will follow you wherever you go. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#009">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">sa1 14:9</a></font></span></p>(d) If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) This he spoke by the spirit of prophecy, and by this God gave him assurance of victory. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#011">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">sa1 14:11</a></font></span></p>And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the (e) holes where they had hid themselves. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Thus they spoke contemptuously and by derision. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#013">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">sa1 14:13</a></font></span></p>And Jonathan climbed up upon (f) his hands and upon his feet, and his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armourbearer slew after him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) That is, he crept up, or went up with all haste. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#014">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">sa1 14:14</a></font></span></p>And that (g) first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, [which] a yoke [of oxen might plow]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) The second was when they slew one another, and the third when the Israelites chased them. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#015">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">sa1 14:15</a></font></span></p>And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth (h) quaked: so it was a very great trembling. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) In that the insensible creatures tremble for fear of God's judgment, it declares how terrible his vengeance will be against his enemies. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#019">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">sa1 14:19</a></font></span></p>And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the noise that [was] in the host of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the priest, (i) Withdraw thine hand. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) Leave the Ephod alone, for I have no time now to ask counsel from God, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#021">Num 27:21</a>). 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#021">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">sa1 14:21</a></font></span></p>Moreover the Hebrews [that] were with the Philistines before that time, which went up with them into the camp [from the country] round about, even they also [turned] to be with the (k) Israelites that [were] with Saul and Jonathan. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) Though before for fear of the Philistines they declared themselves as enemies to their brethren. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#024">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">sa1 14:24</a></font></span></p>And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, (l) Cursed [be] the man that eateth [any] food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted [any] food. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) Such was his hypocrisy and arrogancy, that he thought to attribute to his policy that which God had given by the hand of Jonathan. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#026">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">sa1 14:26</a></font></span></p>And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the (m) oath. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) That is, the punishment if they break their oath. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#027">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">sa1 14:27</a></font></span></p>But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that [was] in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his (n) eyes were enlightened. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(n) Which were dim before from weariness and hunger. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#029">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:29</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">sa1 14:29</a></font></span></p>Then said Jonathan, My father hath (o) troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(o) By making this cruel law. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#033">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:33</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_033">sa1 14:33</a></font></span></p>Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have transgressed: (p) roll a great stone unto me this day. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(p) That the blood of the beast that shall be slain, may be pressed out upon it. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#036">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:36</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_036">sa1 14:36</a></font></span></p>And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us (q) draw near hither unto God. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(q) To ask counsel from him. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#041">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:41</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_041">sa1 14:41</a></font></span></p>Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give (r) a perfect [lot]. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(r) Cause the lot to fall on him that has broken the oath, but he does not consider his presumption in commanding the same oath. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#045">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:45</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_045">sa1 14:45</a></font></span></p>And the people said unto Saul, (s) Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: [as] the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(s) The people thought it their duty to rescue him, who out of ignorance had broken a rash law, and by whom they had received so great a benefit. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#048">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:48</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_048">sa1 14:48</a></font></span></p>And he gathered an host, and smote the (t) Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(t) As the Lord had commanded, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#017">Deu 25:17</a>). 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#049">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:49</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_049">sa1 14:49</a></font></span></p>Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, (u) and Ishui, and Melchishua: and the names of his two daughters [were these]; the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger (x) Michal: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(u) Called also Abinadab, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#002">Sa1 31:2</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(x) Who was the wife of David, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#027">Sa1 18:27</a>). 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#050">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:50</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_050">sa1 14:50</a></font></span></p>And the name of Saul's wife [was] Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host [was] (y) Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(y) Whom Joab, David's captain, slew (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#027">Sa2 3:27</a>). 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#052">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:52</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_052">sa1 14:52</a></font></span></p>And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: (z) and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(z) As Samuel had forewarned in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#011">Sa1 8:11</a>).
