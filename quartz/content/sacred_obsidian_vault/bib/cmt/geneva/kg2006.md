 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#002">4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">kg2 6:2</a></font></span></p>Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan, and take thence every man a (a) beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. And he answered, Go ye. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Or a piece of wood fit to build with. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#006">4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">kg2 6:6</a></font></span></p>And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he shewed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast [it] in thither; and the iron did (b) swim. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) God wrought this miraculously to confirm the authority of Elisha, to whom he had given such abundance of his Spirit. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#008">4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">kg2 6:8</a></font></span></p>Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel with his servants, saying, In (c) such and such a place [shall be] my camp. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Meaning, that he would lie in ambush and take the Israelites unawares. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#010">4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">kg2 6:10</a></font></span></p>And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of, and (d) saved himself there, not once nor twice. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) The wicked conspire nothing so craftily, but God can reveal it to his servants, and cause their counsel to be disclosed. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#012">4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">kg2 6:12</a></font></span></p>And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Elisha, the prophet that [is] in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy (e) bedchamber. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) There is nothing so secret that you can go about, but he knows it, and reveals it to his king. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#014">4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">kg2 6:14</a></font></span></p>Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a (f) great host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Though it was nothing in man's judgment to have taken Elisha, yet the wicked doubt, and think they are never able to prepare enough power, though it be but against one or a few. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#016">4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">kg2 6:16</a></font></span></p>And he answered, (g) Fear not: for they that [be] with us [are] more than they that [be] with them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) For he was assured of God's help, and that millions of angels camped about the godly to deliver them. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#017">4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">kg2 6:17</a></font></span></p>And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes, (h) that he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain [was] full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) That he may behold how you have prepared an army to rescue us. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#018">4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">kg2 6:18</a></font></span></p>And when (i) they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the LORD, and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) Meaning the Syrians his enemies, who came down thinking themselves sure of him. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#019">4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">kg2 6:19</a></font></span></p>And Elisha said unto them, This [is] not the way, neither [is] this the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. But he led (k) them to Samaria. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) Thus he did being led by the Spirit of God, and not because he sought his own revenge, but only to set forth the glory of God. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#021">4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">kg2 6:21</a></font></span></p>And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, (l) My father, shall I smite [them]? shall I smite [them]? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) The wicked use reverent and grave words toward the servants of God, when they think to have any blessing from them, though in their heart they cannot abide them. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#023">4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">kg2 6:23</a></font></span></p>And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. So the bands of Syria came no (m) more into the land of Israel. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) For this gentle intreaty and the miracle wrought by the prophet, did more for peace than if they had been overcome in battle for they did not return at that time to fight against Israel, or in that king's days. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#025">4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">kg2 6:25</a></font></span></p>And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged it, until an ass's head was [sold] for fourscore [pieces] of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove's (n) dung for five [pieces] of silver. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(n) The Hebrews write, that they burned it in the seige for lack of wood. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#027">4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">kg2 6:27</a></font></span></p>And he said, If the LORD do not help thee, whence shall I help thee? out of the (o) barnfloor, or out of the winepress? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(o) Meaning, any kind of food as corn and wine. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#030">4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:30</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_030">kg2 6:30</a></font></span></p>And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes; and he passed by upon the wall, and the people looked, and, behold, [he had] sackcloth within (p) upon his flesh. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(p) Thus hypocrites when they feel God's judgments think to please him with outward ceremonies whom in prosperity they will not know. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#032">4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:32</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_032">kg2 6:32</a></font></span></p>But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and [the king] sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, See ye how this son of a (q) murderer hath sent to take away mine head? look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door: [is] not the sound of his master's feet behind him? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(q) Meaning, Jehoram Ahab's son, who killed the prophets and caused Naboth to be stoned. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#033">4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:33</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_033">kg2 6:33</a></font></span></p>And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil [is] of the LORD; what (r) should I wait for the LORD any longer? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(r) So the wicked fall into a rage and desperation, if they do not find a quick remedy for their afflictions.
