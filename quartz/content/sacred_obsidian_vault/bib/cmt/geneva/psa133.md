 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Because the greatest part was against David, though some favoured him, yet when he was established king at length, they joined all together like brothers: and therefore he shows by these similarities the convenience of brotherly love.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">psa 133:2</a></font></span></p>[It is] like the precious (b) ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, [even] Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) The ointment was a figure of the graces which come from Christ the head of his Church.

 <p>
 </p><p>(c) By Hermon and Zion he means the plentiful country about Jerusalem. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(d) Where there is such concord.
