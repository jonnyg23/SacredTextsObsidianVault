This book is so called because it contains an account of the enumeration and arrangement of the Israelites. The early part of it, from the first through the tenth chapters, appears to be a supplement to Leviticus, being occupied with relating the appointment of the Levites to the sacred offices. The journal of the march through the wilderness is then given as far as <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#020">Num 21:20</a>; after which the early incidents of the invasion are narrated. One direct quotation only from this book (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#005">Num 16:5</a>) is made in the New Testament (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#019">Ti2 2:19</a>); but indirect references to it by the later sacred writers are very numerous.
