Fausset and David Brown [1882] at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#001">Song of Solomon (Canticles) Chapter 7</a></h3>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">sol 7:1</a></font></span></p>thy feet--rather, "thy goings" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#005">Psa 17:5</a>). Evident allusion to <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#007">Isa 52:7</a> : "How beautiful . . . are the feet of him . . . that publisheth peace" (Shulamite, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#013">Sol 6:13</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>shoes--Sandals are richly jewelled in the East (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#022">Luk 15:22</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#015">Eph 6:15</a>). She is evidently "on the mountains," whither she was wafted (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#012">Sol 6:12</a>), above the daughters of Jerusalem, who therefore portray her feet first. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>daughter--of God the Father, with whom Jesus Christ is one (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#009">Mat 5:9</a>), "children of (the) God" (of peace), equivalent to Shulamite (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#010">Psa 45:10-15</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#018">Co2 6:18</a>), as well as bride of Jesus Christ. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>prince's--therefore princely herself, freely giving the word of life to others, not sparing her "feet," as in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#003">Sol 5:3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#011">Exo 12:11</a>. To act on the offensive is defensive to ourselves. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>joints--rather, "the rounding"; the full graceful curve of the hips in the female figure; like the rounding of a necklace (as the Hebrew for "jewels" means). Compare with the English Version, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#013">Eph 4:13-16</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#019">Col 2:19</a>. Or, applying it to the girdle binding together the robes round the hips (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#014">Eph 6:14</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>cunning workman-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#014">Psa 139:14-16</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#010">Eph 2:10</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#022">Eph 2:22</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#029">Eph 5:29-30</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#032">Eph 5:32</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#002">Song of Solomon (Canticles) 7:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">sol 7:2</a></font></span></p>navel--rather, "girdle-clasp," called from the part of the person underneath. The "shoes" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#001">Sol 7:1</a>) prove that dress is throughout presupposed on all parts where it is usually worn. She is "a bride adorned for her husband"; the "uncomely parts," being most adorned (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#023">Co1 12:23</a>). The girdle-clasp was adorned with red rubies resembling the "round goblet" (crater or mixer) of spice-mixed wine (not "liquor," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#002">Sol 8:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#022">Isa 5:22</a>). The wine of the "New Testament in His blood" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#020">Luk 22:20</a>). The spiritual exhilaration by it was mistaken for that caused by new wine (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#013">Act 2:13-17</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#018">Eph 5:18</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>belly--that is, the vesture on it. As in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#013">Psa 45:13-14</a>, gold and needlework compose the bride's attire, so golden-colored "wheat" and white "lilies" here. The ripe grain, in token of harvest joy, used to be decorated with lilies; so the accumulated spiritual food (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#035">Joh 6:35</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#024">Joh 12:24</a>), free from chaff, not fenced with thorns, but made attractive by lilies ("believers," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#002">Sol 2:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#046">Act 2:46-47</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#013">Act 5:13-14</a>, in common partaking of it). Associated with the exhilarating wine cup (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#017">Zac 9:17</a>), as here.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#003">Song of Solomon (Canticles) 7:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">sol 7:3</a></font></span></p>The daughters of Jerusalem describe her in the same terms as Jesus Christ in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#005">Sol 4:5</a>. The testimonies of heaven and earth coincide. 
 <p>
 </p><p>twins--faith and love.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#004">Song of Solomon (Canticles) 7:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">sol 7:4</a></font></span></p>tower of ivory--In <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#004">Sol 4:4</a>, Jesus Christ saith, "a tower of David builded for an armory." Strength and conquest are the main thought in His description; here, beauty and polished whiteness; contrast <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#005">Sol 1:5</a>. 
 <p>
 </p><p>fishpools--seen by BURCKHARDT, clear (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#001">Rev 22:1</a>), deep, quiet, and full (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#010">Co1 2:10</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#015">Co1 2:15</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Heshbon--east of Jordan, residence of the Amorite king, Sihon (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#025">Num 21:25</a>, &amp;c.), afterwards held by Gad. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Bath-rabbim--"daughter of a multitude"; a crowded thoroughfare. Her eyes (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#001">Sol 4:1</a>) are called by Jesus Christ, "doves' eyes," waiting on Him. But here, looked on by the daughters or Jerusalem, they are compared to a placid lake. She is calm even amidst the crowd (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#002">Pro 8:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#033">Joh 16:33</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>nose--or, face. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>tower of Lebanon--a border-fortress, watching the hostile Damascus. Towards Jesus Christ her face was full of holy shame (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#001">Sol 4:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#003">Sol 4:3</a>); towards spiritual foes, like a watchtower (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#001">Hab 2:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#037">Mar 13:37</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#013">Act 4:13</a>), elevated, so that she looks not up from earth to heaven, but down from heaven to earth. If we retain "nose," discernment of spiritual fragrance is meant.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#005">Song of Solomon (Canticles) 7:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">sol 7:5</a></font></span></p>upon thee--the headdress "upon" her. 
 <p>
 </p><p>Carmel--signifying a well-cultivated field (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#002">Isa 35:2</a>). In <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#015">Sol 5:15</a> He is compared to majestic Lebanon; she here, to fruitful Carmel. Her headdress, or crown (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008">Ti2 4:8</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#004">Pe1 5:4</a>). Also the souls won by her (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#019">Th1 2:19-20</a>), a token of her fruitfulness. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>purple--royalty (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006">Rev 1:6</a>). As applied to hair, it expresses the glossy splendor of black hair (literally, "pendulous hair") so much admired in the East (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#001">Sol 4:1</a>). While the King compares her hair to the flowering hair of goats (the token of her subjection), the daughters of Jerusalem compare it to royal purple. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>galleries--(so <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#017">Sol 1:17</a>, Margin; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#003">Rev 21:3</a>). But MAURER translates here, "flowing ringlets"; with these, as with "thongs" (so LEE, from the Arabic translates it) "the King is held" bound (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#005">Sol 6:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#025">Pro 6:25</a>). Her purple crowns of martyrdom especially captivated the King, appearing from His galleries (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#055">Act 7:55-56</a>). As Samson's strength was in his locks (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#017">Jdg 16:17</a>). Here first the daughters see the King themselves.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#006">Song of Solomon (Canticles) 7:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">sol 7:6</a></font></span></p>Nearer advance of the daughters to the Church (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#047">Act 2:47</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#013">Act 5:13</a>, end). Love to her is the first token of love to Him (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#001">Jo1 5:1</a>, end). 
 <p>
 </p><p>delights--fascinating charms to them and to the King (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#005">Sol 7:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#004">Isa 62:4</a>, Hephzi-bah). Hereafter, too (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#017">Zep 3:17</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#012">Mal 3:12</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#009">Rev 21:9</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#007">Song of Solomon (Canticles) 7:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">sol 7:7</a></font></span></p>palm tree-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#012">Psa 92:12</a>). The sure sign of water near (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#027">Exo 15:27</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#038">Joh 7:38</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>clusters--not of dates, as MOODY STUART thinks. The parallelism (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#008">Sol 7:8</a>), "clusters of the vine," shows it is here clusters of grapes. Vines were often trained (termed "wedded") on other trees.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#008">Song of Solomon (Canticles) 7:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">sol 7:8</a></font></span></p>The daughters are no longer content to admire, but resolve to lay hold of her fruits, high though these be. The palm stem is bare for a great height, and has its crown of fruit-laden boughs at the summit. It is the symbol of triumphant joy (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#013">Joh 12:13</a>); so hereafter (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#009">Rev 7:9</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>breasts-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#011">Isa 66:11</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>the vine--Jesus Christ (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#007">Hos 14:7</a>, end; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#001">Joh 15:1</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>nose--that is, breath; the Holy Ghost breathed into her nostrils by Him, whose "mouth is most sweet" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#016">Sol 5:16</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>apples--citrons, off the tree to which He is likened (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#003">Sol 2:3</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#009">Song of Solomon (Canticles) 7:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">sol 7:9</a></font></span></p>roof of thy mouth--thy voice (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#023">Pro 15:23</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>best wine--the new wine of the gospel kingdom (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#025">Mar 14:25</a>), poured out at Pentecost (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#004">Act 2:4</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#013">Act 2:13</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#017">Act 2:17</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>for my beloved-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#010">Sol 4:10</a>). Here first the daughters call Him theirs, and become one with the bride. The steps successively are (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#005">Sol 1:5</a>) where they misjudge her (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#011">Sol 3:11</a>); <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#008">Sol 5:8</a>, where the possibility of their finding Him, before she regained Him, is expressed; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#009">Sol 5:9</a> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#001">Sol 6:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#006">Sol 7:6</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#009">Sol 7:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#042">Joh 4:42</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>causing . . . asleep to speak-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#006">Isa 35:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#019">Mar 5:19-20</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#047">Act 2:47</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#014">Eph 5:14</a>). Jesus Christ's first miracle turned water into "good wine kept until now" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#010">Joh 2:10</a>); just as the Gospel revives those asleep and dying under the law (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#006">Pro 31:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#009">Rom 7:9-10</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#024">Rom 7:24-25</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#001">Rom 8:1</a>).

They are mentioned again distinctly (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#004">Sol 8:4</a>), as fresh converts were being added from among enquirers, and these needed to be charged not to grieve the Spirit. 
 <p>
 </p><p>his desire is toward me--strong assurance. He so desires us, as to give us sense of His desire toward us (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#017">Psa 139:17-18</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#015">Luk 22:15</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#020">Gal 2:20</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#016">Jo1 4:16</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">sol 7:11</a></font></span></p>field--the country. "The tender grape (MAURER translates, flowers) and vines" occurred before (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#013">Sol 2:13</a>). But here she prepares for Him all kinds of fruit old and new; also, she anticipates, in going forth to seek them, communion with Him in "loves." "Early" implies immediate earnestness. "The villages" imply distance from Jerusalem. At Stephen's death the disciples were scattered from it through Judea and Samaria, preaching the word (Acts 8:4-25). Jesus Christ was with them, confirming the word with miracles. They gathered the old fruits, of which Jesus Christ had sown the seed (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#039">Joh 4:39-42</a>), as well as new fruits.

Atropa mandragora of LINNÃUS; its leaves like lettuce, but dark green, flowers purple, root forked, fruit of the size of an apple, ruddy and sweet-smelling, gathered in wheat harvest, that is, in May (Mariti, ii. 195). 
 <p>
