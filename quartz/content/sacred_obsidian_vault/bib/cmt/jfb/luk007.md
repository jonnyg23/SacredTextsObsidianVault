 <p>
 </p><p>Nain--a small village not elsewhere mentioned in Scripture, and only this once probably visited by our Lord; it lay a little to the south of Mount Tabor, about twelve miles from Capernaum.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#012">Luke 7:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">luk 7:12</a></font></span></p>carried out--"was being carried out." Dead bodies, being ceremonially unclean, were not allowed to be buried within the cities (though the kings of David's house were buried m the city of David), and the funeral was usually on the same day as the death. 
 <p>
 </p><p>only son, &amp;c.--affecting particulars, told with delightful simplicity.

 <p>
 </p><p>saw her, he had compassion, &amp;c.--What consolation to thousands of the bereaved has this single verse carried from age to age!
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#014">Luke 7:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">luk 7:14</a></font></span></p>What mingled majesty and grace shines in this scene! The Resurrection and the Life in human flesh, with a word of command, bringing back life to the dead body; Incarnate Compassion summoning its absolute power to dry a widow's tears!
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#016">Luke 7:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">luk 7:16</a></font></span></p>visited his people--more than bringing back the days of Elijah and Elisha (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#017">Kg1 17:17-24</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#032">Kg2 4:32-37</a>; and see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#031">Mat 15:31</a>).

 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#029">Luke 7:29</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">luk 7:29</a></font></span></p>THE BAPTIST'S MESSAGE THE REPLY, AND CONSEQUENT DISCOURSE. (Luke 7:18-35)
 <p>
 </p><p>And all the people that heard--"on hearing (this)." These are the observations of the Evangelist, not of our Lord. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and the publicans--a striking clause. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>justified God, being baptized, &amp;c.--rather, "having been baptized." The meaning is, They acknowledged the divine wisdom of such a preparatory ministry as John's, in leading them to Him who now spake to them (see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#016">Luk 1:16-17</a>); whereas the Pharisees and lawyers, true to themselves in refusing the baptism of John, set at naught also the merciful design of God in the Saviour Himself, to their own destruction.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#031">Luke 7:31</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_031">luk 7:31</a></font></span></p>the Lord said, &amp;c.--As cross, capricious children, invited by their playmates to join them in their amusements, will play with them neither at weddings nor funerals (juvenile imitations of the joyous and mournful scenes of life), so that generation rejected both John and his Master: the one because he was too unsocial--more like a demoniac than a rational man; the other, because He was too much the reverse, given to animal indulgences, and consorting with the lowest classes of society. But the children of Wisdom recognize and honor her, whether in the austere garb of the Baptist or in the more attractive style of his Master, whether in the Law or in the Gospel, whether in rags or in royalty, for "the full soul loatheth an honeycomb, but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#007">Pro 27:7</a>).
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#037">Luke 7:37</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_037">luk 7:37</a></font></span></p>CHRIST'S FEET WASHED WITH TEARS. (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#036">Luk 7:36-50</a>)
 <p>
 </p><p>a sinner--one who had led a profligate life. Note.--There is no ground whatever for the popular notion that this woman was Mary Magdalene, nor do we know what her name was. (See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#002">Luk 8:2</a>.) 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>an alabaster box of ointment--a perfume vessel, in some cases very costly (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#005">Joh 12:5</a>). "The ointment has here a peculiar interest, as the offering by a penitent of what had been an accessory in her unhallowed work of sin" [ALFORD].
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#038">Luke 7:38</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_038">luk 7:38</a></font></span></p>at his feet behind him--the posture at meals being a reclining one, with the feet out behind. 
 <p>
 </p><p>began to wash, &amp;c.--to "water with a shower." The tears, which were quite involuntary, poured down in a flood upon His naked feet, as she bent down to kiss them; and deeming them rather fouled than washed by this, she hastened to wipe them off with the only towel she had, the long tresses of her own hair, "with which slaves were wont to wash their masters' feet" [STIER]. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>kissed--The word signifies "to kiss fondly, to caress," or to "kiss again and again," which <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#045">Luk 7:45</a> shows is meant here. What prompted this? Much love, springing from a sense of much forgiveness. So says He who knew her heart (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#047">Luk 7:47</a>). Where she had met with Christ before, or what words of His had brought life to her dead heart and a sense of divine pardon to her guilty soul, we know not. But probably she was of the crowd of "publicans and sinners" whom Incarnate Compassion drew so often around Him, and heard from His lips some of those words such as never man spake, "Come unto Me, all ye that labour," &amp;c. No personal interview had up to this time taken place between them; but she could keep her feelings no longer to herself, and having found her way to Him (and entered along with him, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#045">Luk 7:45</a>), they burst forth in this surpassing yet most artless style, as if her whole soul would go out to Him.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#039">Luke 7:39</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_039">luk 7:39</a></font></span></p>the Pharisee--who had formed no definite opinion of our Lord, and invited Him apparently to obtain materials for a judgment. 
 <p>
 </p><p>spake within himself, &amp;c.--"Ha! I have Him now; He plainly knows nothing of the person He allows to touch Him; and so, He can be no prophet." Not so fast, Simon; thou hast not seen through thy Guest yet, but He hath seen through thee.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#040">Luke 7:40</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_040">luk 7:40</a></font></span></p>Like Nathan with David, our Lord conceals His home thrust under the veil of a parable, and makes His host himself pronounce upon the case. The two debtors are the woman and Simon; the criminality of the one was ten times that of the other (in the proportion of "five hundred" to "fifty"); but both being equally insolvent, both are with equal frankness forgiven; and Simon is made to own that the greatest debtor to forgiving mercy will cling to her Divine Benefactor with the deepest gratitude. Does our Lord then admit that Simon was a forgiving man? Let us see.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#044">Luke 7:44</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_044">luk 7:44</a></font></span></p>I entered . . . no water--a compliment to guests. Was this "much love?" Was it any?
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#045">Luke 7:45</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_045">luk 7:45</a></font></span></p>no kiss--of salutation. How much love was here? Any at all?
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#046">Luke 7:46</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_046">luk 7:46</a></font></span></p>with oil . . . not anoint--even common olive oil in contrast with the woman's "ointment" or aromatic balsam. What evidence was thus afforded of any feeling which forgiveness prompts? Our Lord speaks this with delicate politeness, as if hurt at these inattentions of His host, which though not invariably shown to guests, were the customary marks of studied respect and regard. The inference is plain--only one of the debtors was really forgiven, though in the first instance, to give room for the play of withheld feelings, the forgiveness of both is supposed in the parable.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#047">Luke 7:47</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_047">luk 7:47</a></font></span></p>Her sins which are many--"Those many sins of hers," our Lord, who admitted how much more she owed than the Pharisee, now proclaims in naked terms the forgiveness of her guilt. 
 <p>
 </p><p>for--not because, as if love were the cause of forgiveness, but "inasmuch as," or "in proof of which." The latter clause of the verse, and the whole structure of the parable, plainly show this to be the meaning. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>little forgiven . . . loveth little--delicately ironical intimation of no love and no forgiveness in the present case.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#048">Luke 7:48</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_048">luk 7:48</a></font></span></p>said unto her, &amp;c.--an unsought assurance, usually springing up unexpected in the midst of active duty and warm affections, while often it flies from those who mope and are paralyzed for want of it.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#049">Luke 7:49</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_049">luk 7:49</a></font></span></p>they that sat . . . Who is this, &amp;c.--No wonder they were startled to hear One who was reclining at the same couch, and partaking of the same hospitalities with themselves, assume the awful prerogative of "even forgiving sins." But so far from receding from this claim, or softening it down, our Lord only repeats it, with two precious additions: one, announcing what was the one secret of the "forgiveness" she had experienced, and which carried "salvation" in its bosom; the other, a glorious dismissal of her in that "peace" which she had already felt, but is now assured she has His full warrant to enjoy! This wonderful scene teaches two very weighty truths: (1) Though there be degrees of guilt, insolvency, or inability to wipe out the dishonor done to God, is common to all sinners. (2) As Christ is the Great Creditor to whom all debt, whether great or small, contracted by sinners is owing, so to Him belongs the prerogative of forgiving it. This latter truth is brought out in the structure and application of the present parable as it is nowhere else. Either then Jesus was a blaspheming deceiver, or He is God manifest in the flesh.
