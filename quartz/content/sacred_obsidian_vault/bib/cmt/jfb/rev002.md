 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>A Commentary, Critical, Practical, and Explanatory on the Old and New Testaments</i>, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown [1882] at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#001">Revelation Chapter 2</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#001">Revelation 2:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">rev 2:1</a></font></span></p>EPISTLES TO EPHESUS, SMYRNA, PERGAMOS, THYATIRA. (Rev. 2:1-29)
 <p>
 </p><p>Ephesus--famed for the temple of Diana, one of the seven wonders of the world. For three years Paul labored there. He subsequently ordained Timothy superintending overseer or bishop there: probably his charge was but of a temporary nature. John, towards the close of his life, took it as the center from which he superintended the province. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>holdeth--Greek, "holdeth fast," as in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#025">Rev 2:25</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#011">Rev 3:11</a>; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#028">Joh 10:28-29</a>. The title of Christ here as "holding fast the seven stars (from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#016">Rev 1:16</a> : only that, for having is substituted holding fast in His grasp), and walking in the midst of the seven candlesticks," accords with the beginning of His address to the seven churches representing the universal Church. Walking expresses His unwearied activity in the Church, guarding her from internal and external evils, as the high priest moved to and fro in the sanctuary.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#002">Revelation 2:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">rev 2:2</a></font></span></p>I know thy works--expressing His omniscience. Not merely "thy professions, desires, good resolutions" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#013">Rev 14:13</a>, end). 
 <p>
 </p><p>thy labour--Two oldest manuscripts omit "thy"; one supports it. The Greek means "labor unto weariness." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>patience--persevering endurance. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>bear--evil men are a burden which the Ephesian Church regarded as intolerable. We are to "bear (the same Greek, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#002">Gal 6:2</a>) one another's burdens" in the case of weak brethren; but not to bear false brethren. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>tried--by experiment; not the Greek for "test," as <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#001">Jo1 4:1</a>. The apostolical churches had the miraculous gift of discerning spirits. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028">Act 20:28-30</a>, wherein Paul presciently warned the Ephesian elders of the coming false teachers, as also in writing to Timothy at Ephesus. TERTULLIAN [On Baptism, 17], and JEROME [On Illustrious Men, in Lucca 7], record of John, that when a writing, professing to be a canonical history of the acts of Paul, had been composed by a presbyter of Ephesus, John convicted the author and condemned the work. So on one occasion he would not remain under the same roof with Cerinthus the heretic. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>say they are apostles--probably Judaizers. IGNATIUS [Epistle to the Ephesians, 6], says subsequently, "Onesimus praises exceedingly your good discipline that no heresy dwells among you"; and [Epistle to the Ephesians, 9], "Ye did not permit those having evil doctrine to sow their seed among you, but closed your ears."
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#003">Revelation 2:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">rev 2:3</a></font></span></p>borne . . . patience--The oldest manuscripts transpose these words. Then translate as Greek, "persevering endurance . . . borne." "Thou hast borne" My reproach, but "thou canst not bear the evil" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#002">Rev 2:2</a>). A beautiful antithesis. 
 <p>
 </p><p>and . . . hast laboured, and hast not fainted--The two oldest manuscripts and oldest versions read, "and . . . hast not labored," omitting "and hast fainted." The difficulty which transcribers by English Version reading tried to obviate, was the seeming contradiction, "I know thy labor . . . and thou hast not labored." But what is meant is, "Thou hast not been wearied out with labor."
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#004">Revelation 2:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">rev 2:4</a></font></span></p>somewhat . . . because--Translate, "I have against thee (this) that," &amp;c. It is not a mere somewhat"; it is everything. How characteristic of our gracious Lord, that He puts foremost all He can find to approve, and only after this notes the shortcomings! 
 <p>
 </p><p>left thy first love--to Christ. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#012">Ti1 5:12</a>, "cast off their first faith." See the Ephesians' first love, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#015">Eph 1:15</a>. This epistle was written under Domitian, when thirty years had elapsed since Paul had written his Epistle to them. Their warmth of love had given place to a lifeless orthodoxy. Compare Paul's view of faith so called without love, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#002">Co1 13:2</a>.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#005">Revelation 2:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">rev 2:5</a></font></span></p>whence--from what a height. 
 <p>
 </p><p>do the first works--the works which flowed from thy first love. Not merely "feel thy first feelings," but do works flowing from the same principle as formerly, "faith which worketh by love." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>I will come--Greek, "I am coming" in special judgment on thee. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>quickly--omitted in two oldest manuscripts, Vulgate and Coptic versions: supported by one oldest manuscript. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>remove thy candlestick out of his place--I will take away the Church from Ephesus and remove it elsewhere. "It is removal of the candlestick, not extinction of the candle, which is threatened here; judgment for some, but that very judgment the occasion of mercy for others. So it has been. The seat of the Church has been changed, but the Church itself survives. What the East has lost, the West has gained. One who lately visited Ephesus found only three Christians there, and these so ignorant as scarcely to have heard the names of St. Paul or St. John" [TRENCH].
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#006">Revelation 2:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">rev 2:6</a></font></span></p>But--How graciously, after necessary censure, He returns to praise for our consolation, and as an example to us, that we would show, when we reprove, we have more pleasure in praising than in fault-finding. 
 <p>
 </p><p>hatest the deeds--We should hate men's evil deeds, not hate the men themselves. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Nicolaitanes--IRENÃUS [Against Heresies, 1.26.3] and TERTULLIAN [Prescription against Heretics, 46] make these followers of Nicolas, one of the seven (honorably mentioned, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#003">Act 6:3</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#005">Act 6:5</a>). They (CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA [Miscellanies, 2.20 3.4] and EPIPHANIUS [Heresies, 25]) evidently confound the latter Gnostic Nicolaitanes, or followers of one Nicolaos, with those of Revelation. MICHAELIS' view is probable: Nicolaos (conqueror of the people) is the Greek version of Balaam, from Hebrew "Belang Am," "Destroyer of the people." Revelation abounds in such duplicate Hebrew and Greek names: as Apollyon, Abaddon: Devil, Satan: Yea (Greek, "Nai"), Amen. The name, like other names, Egypt, Babylon, Sodom, is symbolic. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#014">Rev 2:14-15</a>, which shows the true sense of Nicolaitanes; they are not a sect, but professing Christians who, like Balaam of old. tried to introduce into the Church a false freedom, that is, licentiousness; this was a reaction in the opposite direction from Judaism, the first danger to the Church combated in the council of Jerusalem, and by Paul in the Epistle to Galatians. These symbolical Nicolaitanes, or followers of Balaam, abused Paul's doctrine of the grace of God into a plea for lasciviousness (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#015">Pe2 2:15-16</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#019">Pe2 2:19</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#004">Jde 1:4</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#011">Jde 1:11</a> who both describe the same sort of seducers as followers of Balaam). The difficulty that they should appropriate a name branded with infamy in Scripture is met by TRENCH: The Antinomian Gnostics were so opposed to John as a Judaizing apostle that they would assume as a name of chiefest honor one which John branded with dishonor.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#007">Revelation 2:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">rev 2:7</a></font></span></p>He that hath an ear--This clause precedes the promise in the first three addresses, succeeds it in the last four. Thus the promises are enclosed on both sides with the precept urging the deepest attention as to the most momentous truths. Every man "hath an ear" naturally, but he alone will be able to hear spiritually to whom God has given "the hearing ear"; whose "ear God hath wakened" and "opened." Compare "Faith, the ears of the soul" [CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>the Spirit saith--What Christ saith, the Spirit saith; so one are the Second and Third Persons. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>unto the churches--not merely to the particular, but to the universal Church. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>overcometh--In John's Gospel (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#033">Joh 16:33</a>) and First Epistle (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#013">Jo1 2:13-14</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#004">Jo1 5:4-5</a>) an object follows, namely, "the world," "the wicked one." Here, where the final issue is spoken of, the conqueror is named absolutely. Paul uses a similar image (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#024">Co1 9:24-25</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#005">Ti2 2:5</a>; but not the same as John's phrase, except <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#021">Rom 12:21</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>will I give--as the Judge. The tree of life in Paradise, lost by the fall, is restored by the Redeemer. Allusions to it occur in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#018">Pro 3:18</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#030">Pro 11:30</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#012">Pro 13:12</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#004">Pro 15:4</a>, and prophetically, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#002">Rev 22:2</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#014">Rev 22:14</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#012">Eze 47:12</a>; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#051">Joh 6:51</a>. It is interesting to note how closely these introductory addresses are linked to the body of Revelation. Thus, the tree of life here, with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#001">Rev 22:1</a>; deliverance from the second death (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#011">Rev 2:11</a>), with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#014">Rev 20:14</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#008">Rev 21:8</a>; the new name (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#017">Rev 2:17</a>), with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#001">Rev 14:1</a>; power over the nations, with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#004">Rev 20:4</a>; the morning star (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#028">Rev 2:28</a>), with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#016">Rev 22:16</a>; the white raiment (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#005">Rev 3:5</a>), with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#004">Rev 4:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#015">Rev 16:15</a>; the name in the book of life (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#005">Rev 3:5</a>), with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#008">Rev 13:8</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#015">Rev 20:15</a>; the new Jerusalem and its citizenship (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#012">Rev 3:12</a>), with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#010">Rev 21:10</a>. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>give . . . tree of life--The thing promised corresponds to the kind of faithfulness manifested. They who refrain from Nicolaitane indulgences (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#006">Rev 2:6</a>) and idol-meats (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#014">Rev 2:14-15</a>), shall eat of meat infinitely superior, namely, the fruit of the tree of life, and the hidden manna (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#017">Rev 2:17</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>in the midst of the paradise--The oldest manuscripts omit "the midst of." In <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#009">Gen 2:9</a> these words are appropriate, for there were other trees in the garden, but not in the midst of it. Here the tree of life is simply in the paradise, for no other tree is mentioned in it; in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#002">Rev 22:2</a> the tree of life is "in the midst of the street of Jerusalem"; from this the clause was inserted here. Paradise (a Persian, or else Semitic word), originally used of any garden of delight; then specially of Eden; then the temporary abode of separate souls in bliss; then "the Paradise of God," the third heaven, the immediate presence of God. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>of God-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#013">Eze 28:13</a>). One oldest manuscript, with Vulgate, Syriac, and Coptic, and CYPRIAN, read, "MY God," as in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#012">Rev 3:12</a>. So Christ calls God, "My God and your God" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#017">Joh 20:17</a>; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#017">Eph 1:17</a>). God is our God, in virtue of being peculiarly Christ's God. The main bliss of Paradise is that it is the Paradise of God; God Himself dwelling there (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#003">Rev 21:3</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#008">Revelation 2:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">rev 2:8</a></font></span></p>Smyrna--in Ionia, a little to the north of Ephesus. POLYCARP, martyred in A.D. 168, eighty-six years after his conversion, was bishop, and probably "the angel of the Church in Smyrna" meant here. The allusions to persecutions and faithfulness unto death accord with this view. IGNATIUS [The Martyrdom of Ignatius 3], on his way to martyrdom in Rome, wrote to POLYCARP, then (A.D. 108) bishop of Smyrna; if his bishopric commenced ten or twelve years earlier, the dates will harmonize. TERTULLIAN [The Prescription against Heretics, 32], and IRENÃUS, who had talked with POLYCARP in youth, tell us POLYCARP was consecrated bishop of Smyrna by St. John. 
 <p>
 </p><p>the first . . . the last . . . was dead . . . is alive--The attributes of Christ most calculated to comfort the Church of Smyrna under its persecutions; resumed from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#017">Rev 1:17-18</a>. As death was to Him but the gate to life eternal, so it is to be to them (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#010">Rev 2:10-11</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#009">Revelation 2:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">rev 2:9</a></font></span></p>thy works, and--omitted in two oldest manuscripts, Vulgate, and Coptic. Supported by one oldest manuscript. 
 <p>
 </p><p>tribulation--owing to persecution. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>poverty--owing to "the spoiling of their goods." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>but thou art rich--in grace. Contrast Laodicea, rich in the world's eyes and her own, poor before God. "There are both poor rich-men, and rich poor-men in God's sight" [TRENCH]. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>blasphemy of them--blasphemous calumny of thee on the part of (or arising from) them. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>say they are Jews, and are not--Jews by national descent, but not spiritually of "the true circumcision." The Jews blaspheme Christ as "the hanged one." As elsewhere, so at Smyrna they bitterly opposed Christianity; and at POLYCARP'S martyrdom they joined the heathens in clamoring for his being cast to the lions; and when there was an obstacle to this, for his being burnt alive; and with their own hands they carried logs for the pile. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>synagogue of Satan--Only once is the term "synagogue" in the New Testament used of the Christian assembly, and that by the apostle who longest maintained the union of the Church and Jewish Synagogue. As the Jews more and more opposed Christianity, and it more and more rooted itself in the Gentile world, the term "synagogue" was left altogether to the former, and Christians appropriated exclusively the honorable term "Church"; contrast an earlier time when the Jewish theocracy is called "the Church in the wilderness." Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#003">Num 16:3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#004">Num 20:4</a>, "congregation of the Lord." Even in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#002">Jam 2:2</a> it is "your (not the Lord's) assembly." The Jews, who might have been "the Church of God," had now, by their opposition and unbelief, become the synagogue of Satan. So "the throne of Satan" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#013">Rev 2:13</a>) represents the heathens' opposition to Christianity; "the depths of Satan" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#024">Rev 2:24</a>), the opposition of heretics.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#010">Revelation 2:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">rev 2:10</a></font></span></p>Fear none, &amp;c.--the oldest manuscripts read, "Fear not those things," &amp;c. "The Captain of our salvation never keeps back what those who faithfully witness for Him may have to bear for His name's sake; never entices recruits by the promise they shall find all things easy and pleasant there" [TRENCH]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>devil--"the accuser." He acted, through Jewish accusers against Christ and His people. The conflict of the latter was not with mere flesh and blood, but with the rulers of the darkness of this world. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>tried--with temptation by "the devil." The same event is often both a temptation from the devil, and a trial from God--God sifting and winnowing the man to separate his chaff from his wheat, the devil sifting him in the hope that nothing but chaff will be found in him [TRENCH]. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>ten days--not the ten persecutions from Nero to Diocletian. LYRA explains ten years on the year-day principle. The shortness of the duration of the persecution is evidently made the ground of consolation. The time of trial shall be short, the duration of your joy shall be for ever. Compare the use of "ten days" for a short time, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#055">Gen 24:55</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#019">Num 11:19</a>. Ten is the number of the world powers hostile to the Church; compare the ten horns of the beast, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#001">Rev 13:1</a>. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>unto death--so as even to endure death for My sake. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>crown of life-- <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#012">Jam 1:12</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008">Ti2 4:8</a>, "crown of righteousness"; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#004">Pe1 5:4</a>, "crown of glory." The crown is the garland, the mark of a conqueror, or of one rejoicing, or at a feast; but diadem is the mark of a KING.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#011">Revelation 2:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">rev 2:11</a></font></span></p>shall not be hurt--Greek, "shall not by any means (or possibly) be hurt." 
 <p>
 </p><p>the second death--"the lake of fire." "The death in life of the lost, as contrasted with the life in death of the saved" [TRENCH]. The phrase "the second death" is peculiar to the Apocalypse. What matter about the first death, which sooner or later must pass over us, if we escape the second death? "It seems that they who die that death shall be hurt by it; whereas, if it were annihilation, and so a conclusion of their torments, it would be no way hurtful, but highly beneficial to them. But the living torments are the second death" [BISHOP PEARSON]. "The life of the damned is death" [AUGUSTINE]. Smyrna (meaning myrrh) yielded its sweet perfume in being bruised even to death. Myrrh was used in embalming dead bodies (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#039">Joh 19:39</a>); was an ingredient in the holy anointing oil (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#023">Exo 30:23</a>); a perfume of the heavenly Bridegroom (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#008">Psa 45:8</a>), and of the bride (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#006">Sol 3:6</a>). "Affliction, like it, is bitter for the time being, but salutary; preserving the elect from corruption, and seasoning them for immortality, and gives scope for the exercise of the fragrantly breathing Christian virtues" [VITRINGA]. POLYCARP'S noble words to his heathen judges who wished him to recant, are well known: "Fourscore and six years have I served the Lord, and He never wronged me, how then can I blaspheme my King and Saviour?" Smyrna's faithfulness is rewarded by its candlestick not having been removed out of its place (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#005">Rev 2:5</a>); Christianity has never wholly left it; whence the Turks call it, "Infidel Smyrna."

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">rev 2:12</a></font></span></p>TRENCH prefers writing Pergamus, or rather, Pergamum, on the river Caicus. It was capital of Attalus the Second's kingdom, which was bequeathed by him to the Romans, 133 B.C. Famous for its library, founded by Eumenes (197-159), and destroyed by Caliph Omar. Parchment, that is, Pergamena charta, was here discovered for book purposes. Also famous for the magnificent temple of Ãsculapius, the healing god [TACITUS, Annals, 3.63].

 <p>
 </p><p>Satan's seat--rather as the Greek is translated all through Revelation, "throne." Satan, in impious mimicry of God's heavenly throne, sets up his earthly throne (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#002">Rev 4:2</a>). Ãsculapius was worshipped there under the serpent form; and Satan, the old serpent, as the instigator (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#010">Rev 2:10</a>) of fanatical devotees of Ãsculapius, and, through them, of the supreme magistracy at Pergamos, persecuted one of the Lord's people (Antipas) even to death. Thus, this address is an anticipatory preface to Rev. 12:1-17; Note: "throne . . . the dragon, Satan . . . war with her seed," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#005">Rev 12:5</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#009">Rev 12:9</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#017">Rev 12:17</a>.

 </p><p>
 </p><p>wherein--Two oldest manuscripts omit this (then translate, "in the days of Antipas, My faithful witness," or "martyr"); two retain it. Two oldest manuscripts read, "My witness, MY faithful one"; two read as English Version. Antipas is another form for Antipater. SIMEON METAPHRASTES has a palpably legendary story, unknown to the early Fathers, that Antipas, in Domitian's reign, was shut up in a red-hot brazen bull, and ended his life in thanksgivings and prayers. HENGSTENBERG makes the name, like other apocalyptic names, symbolical, meaning one standing out "against all" for Christ's sake.

 </p><p>hold the doctrine of Balaam--"the teaching of Balaam," namely, that which he "taught Balak." Compare "the counsel of Balaam," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#016">Num 31:16</a>. "Balak" is dative in the Greek, whence BENGEL translates, "taught (the Moabites) for (that is, to please) Balak." But though in Numbers it is not expressly said he taught Balak, yet there is nothing said inconsistent with his having done so; and JOSEPHUS [Antiquities,4. 6. 6], says he did so. The dative case is a Hebraism for the accusative case.

 </p><p>
 </p><p>eat things sacrificed unto idols--the act common to the Israelites of old, and the Nicolaitanes in John's day; he does not add what was peculiar to the Israelites, namely, that they sacrificed to idols. The temptation to eat idol-meats was a peculiarly strong one to the Gentile converts. For not to do so involved almost a withdrawal from partaking of any social meal with the heathen around. For idol-meats, after a part had been offered in sacrifice, were nearly sure to be on the heathen entertainer's table; so much so, that the Greek "to kill" (thuein) meant originally "to sacrifice." Hence arose the decree of the council of Jerusalem forbidding to eat such meats; subsequently some at Corinth ate unscrupulously and knowingly of such meats, on the ground that the idol is nothing; others needlessly tortured themselves with scruples, lest unknowingly they should eat of them when they got meat from the market or in a heathen friend's house. Paul handles the question in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#001">Co1 8:1-13</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#025">Co1 10:25-33</a>.

Literal eating of idol-meats and fornication in Pergamos were accompanied by spiritual idolatry and fornication. So TRENCH explains. But I prefer taking it, "THOU also," as well as Ephesus ("in like manner" as Ephesus; see below the oldest reading), hast . . . Nicolaitanes, with this important difference, Ephesus, as a Church, hates them and casts them out, but thou "hast them," namely, in the Church.

 </p><p>
 </p><p>which thing I hate--It is sin not to hate what God hates. The Ephesian Church (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#006">Rev 2:6</a>) had this point of superiority to Pergamos. But the three oldest manuscripts, and Vulgate and Syriac, read instead of "which I hate," "IN LIKE MANNER."

Not only the Nicolaitanes, but the whole Church of Pergamos is called on to repent of not having hated the Nicolaitane teaching and practice.

 <p>
 </p><p>I will come--I am coming.

The spiritual Balaamites of John's day are to be smitten with the Lord's spiritual sword, the word or "rod of His mouth."

 <p>
 </p><p>the hidden manna--the heavenly food of Israel, in contrast to the idol-meats (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#014">Rev 2:14</a>). A pot of manna was laid up in the holy place "before the testimony." The allusion is here to this: probably also to the Lord's discourse (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#031">Joh 6:31-35</a>). Translate, "the manna which is hidden." As the manna hidden in the sanctuary was by divine power preserved from corruption, so Christ in His incorruptible body has passed into the heavens, and is hidden there until the time of His appearing. Christ Himself is the manna "hidden" from the world, but revealed to the believer, so that he has already a foretaste of His preciousness. Compare as to Christ's own hidden food on earth, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#032">Joh 4:32</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#034">Joh 4:34</a>, and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#012">Job 23:12</a>. The full manifestation shall be at His coming. Believers are now hidden, even as their meat is hidden. As the manna in the sanctuary, unlike the other manna, was incorruptible, so the spiritual feast offered to all who reject the world's dainties for Christ is everlasting: an incorruptible body and life for ever in Christ at the resurrection. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>white stone . . . new name . . . no man knoweth saving he--TRENCH'S explanation seems best. White is the color and livery of heaven. "New" implies something altogether renewed and heavenly. The white stone is a glistening diamond, the Urim borne by the high priest within the choschen or breastplate of judgment, with the twelve tribes' names on the twelve precious stones, next the heart. The word Urim means "light," answering to the color white. None but the high priest knew the name written upon it, probably the incommunicable name of God, "Jehovah." The high priest consulted it in some divinely appointed way to get direction from God when needful. The "new name" is Christ's (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#012">Rev 3:12</a>, "I will write upon him My new name"): some new revelation of Himself which shall hereafter be imparted to His people, and which they alone are capable of receiving. The connection with the "hidden manna" will thus be clear, as none save the high priest had access to the "manna hidden" in the sanctuary. Believers, as spiritual priests unto God, shall enjoy the heavenly antitypes to the hidden manna and the Urim stone. What they had peculiarly to contend against at Pergamos was the temptation to idol-meats, and fornication, put in their way by Balaamites. As Phinehas was rewarded with "an everlasting priesthood" for his zeal against these very sins to which the Old Testament Balaam seduced Israel; so the heavenly high priesthood is the reward promised here to those zealous against the New Testament Balaamites tempting Christ's people to the same sins. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>receiveth it--namely, "the stone"; not "the new name"; see above. The "name that no man knew but Christ Himself," He shall hereafter reveal to His people.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">rev 2:18</a></font></span></p>Thyatira--in Lydia, south of Pergamos. Lydia, the purple-seller of this city, having been converted at Philippi, a Macedonian city (with which Thyatira, as being a Macedonian colony, had naturally much intercourse), was probably the instrument of first carrying the Gospel to her native town. John follows the geographical order here, for Thyatira lay a little to the left of the road from Pergamos to Sardis [STRABO, 13:4]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>Son of God . . . eyes like . . . fire . . . feet . . . like fine brass--or "glowing brass" (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#014">Rev 1:14-15</a>, whence this description is resumed). Again His attributes accord with His address. The title "Son of God," is from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007">Psa 2:7</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#009">Psa 2:9</a>, which is referred to in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#027">Rev 2:27</a>. The attribute, "eyes like a flame," &amp;c., answers to <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#023">Rev 2:23</a>, "I am He which searcheth the reins and hearts." The attribute, "feet like . . . brass," answers to <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#027">Rev 2:27</a>, "as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers," He treading them to pieces with His strong feet.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">rev 2:19</a></font></span></p>The oldest manuscripts transpose the English Version order, and read, "faith and service." The four are subordinate to "thy works"; thus, "I know thy works, even the love and the faith (these two forming one pair, as 'faith works by love,' <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#006">Gal 5:6</a>), and the service (ministration to the suffering members of the Church, and to all in spiritual or temporal need), and the endurance of (that is, shown by) thee (this pronoun belongs to all four)." As love is inward, so service is its outward manifestation. Similarly, faith and persevering endurance, or "patient continuance (the same Greek as here, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#007">Rom 2:7</a>) in well-doing," are connected. 
 <p>
 </p><p>and thy works; and the last--Omit the second "and," with the three oldest manuscripts and the ancient versions; translate, "And (I know) thy works which are last (to be) more in number than the first"; realizing <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#001">Th1 4:1</a>; the converse of <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#045">Mat 12:45</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#020">Pe2 2:20</a>. Instead of retrograding from "the first works" and "first love," as Ephesus, Thyatira's last works exceeded her first (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#004">Rev 2:4-5</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#020">Revelation 2:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">rev 2:20</a></font></span></p>a few things--omitted in the three oldest manuscripts. Translate then, "I have against thee that," &amp;c. 
 <p>
 </p><p>sufferest--The three oldest manuscripts read, "lettest alone." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>that woman--Two oldest manuscripts read, "THY wife"; two omit it. Vulgate and most ancient versions read as English Version. The symbolical Jezebel was to the Church of Thyatira what Jezebel, Ahab's "wife," was to him. Some self-styled prophetess (or as the feminine in Hebrew is often used collectively to express a multitude, a set of false prophets), as closely attached to the Church of Thyatira as a wife is to a husband, and as powerfully influencing for evil that Church as Jezebel did Ahab. As Balaam, in Israel's early history, so Jezebel, daughter of Eth-baal, king of Sidon (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#031">Kg1 16:31</a>, formerly priest of Astarte, and murderer of his predecessor on the throne, JOSEPHUS [Against Apion, 1.18]), was the great seducer to idolatry in Israel's later history. Like her father, she was swift to shed blood. Wholly given to Baal worship, like Eth-baal, whose name expresses his idolatry, she, with her strong will, seduced the weak Ahab and Israel beyond the calf-worship (which was a worship of the true God under the cherub-ox form, that is, a violation of the second commandment) to that of Baal (a violation of the first commandment also). She seems to have been herself a priestess and prophetess of Baal. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#022">Kg2 9:22</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#030">Kg2 9:30</a>, "whoredoms of . . . Jezebel and her witchcrafts" (impurity was part of the worship of the PhÅnician Astarte, or Venus). Her spiritual counterpart at Thyatira lured God's "servants" by pretended utterances of inspiration to the same libertinism, fornication, and eating of idol-meats, as the Balaamites and Nicolaitanes (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#006">Rev 2:6</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#014">Rev 2:14-15</a>). By a false spiritualism these seducers led their victims into the grossest carnality, as though things done in the flesh were outside the true man, and were, therefore, indifferent. "The deeper the Church penetrated into heathenism, the more she herself became heathenish; this prepares us for the expressions 'harlot' and 'Babylon,' applied to her afterwards" [AUBERLEN]. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>to teach and to seduce--The three oldest manuscripts read, "and she teaches and seduces," or "deceives." "Thyatira was just the reverse of Ephesus. There, much zeal for orthodoxy, but little love; here, activity of faith and love, but insufficient zeal for godly discipline and doctrine, a patience of error even where there was not a participation in it" [TRENCH].

 <p>
 </p><p>of her fornication . . . she repented not--The three oldest manuscripts read, "and she willeth not to repent of (literally, 'out of,' that is, so as to come out of) her fornication." Here there is a transition from literal to spiritual fornication, as appears from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#022">Rev 2:22</a>. The idea arose from Jehovah's covenant relation to the Old Testament Church being regarded as a marriage, any transgression against which was, therefore, harlotry, fornication, or adultery.

 </p><p>I will--Greek present, "I cast her." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>a bed--The place of her sin shall be the place of her punishment. The bed of her sin shall be her bed of sickness and anguish. Perhaps a pestilence was about to be sent. Or the bed of the grave, and of the hell beyond, where the worm dieth not. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>them that commit adultery with her--spiritually; including both the eating of idol-meats and fornication. "With her," in the Greek, implies participation with her in her adulteries, namely, by suffering her (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#020">Rev 2:20</a>), or letting her alone, and so virtually encouraging her. Her punishment is distinct from theirs; she is to be cast into a bed, and her children to be killed; while those who make themselves partakers of her sin by tolerating her, are to be cast into great tribulation. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>except they repent--Greek aorist, "repent" at once; shall have repented by the time limited in My purpose. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>their deeds--Two of the oldest manuscripts and most ancient versions read "her." Thus, God's true servants, who by connivance, are incurring the guilt of her deeds, are distinguished from her. One oldest manuscript, ANDREAS, and CYPRIAN, support "their."

Her proper adherents; not those who suffer her, but those who are begotten of her.

 <p>
 </p><p>kill . . . with death--Compare the disaster that overtook the literal Jezebel's votaries of Baal, and Ahab's sons, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#040">Kg1 18:40</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#006">Kg2 10:6-7</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#024">Kg2 10:24-25</a>. Kill with death is a Hebraism for slay with most sure and awful death; so "dying thou shalt die" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#017">Gen 2:17</a>). Not "die the common death of men" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#029">Num 16:29</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>all the churches shall know--implying that these addresses are designed for the catholic Church of all ages and places. So palpably shall God's hand be seen in the judgment on Thyatira, that the whole Church shall recognize it as God's doing.

 </p><p>I am he--the "I" is strongly emphatical: "that it is I am He who," &amp;c. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>searcheth . . . hearts--God's peculiar attribute is given to Christ. The "reins" are the seat of the desires; the "heart," that of the thoughts. The Greek for "searcheth" expresses an accurate following up of all tracks and windings. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>unto every one of you--literally, "unto you, to each."

 </p><p>
 </p><p>the depths--These false prophets boasted peculiarly of their knowledge of mysteries and the deep things of God; pretensions subsequently expressed by their arrogant title, Gnostics ("full of knowledge"). The Spirit here declares their so-called "depths," (namely, of knowledge of divine things) to be really "depths of Satan"; just as in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#009">Rev 2:9</a>, He says, instead of "the synagogue of God," "the synagogue of Satan." HENGSTENBERG thinks the teachers themselves professed to fathom the depths of Satan, giving loose rein to fleshly lusts, without being hurt thereby. They who thus think to fight Satan with his own weapons always find him more than a match for them. The words, "as they speak," that is, "as they call them," coming after not only "depths," but "depths of Satan," seem to favor this latter view; otherwise I should prefer the former, in which case, "as they speak," or "call them," must refer to "depths" only, not also "depths of Satan." The original sin of Adam was a desire to know EVIL as well as good, so in HENGSTENBERG'S view, those who professed to know "the depths of Satan." It is the prerogative of God alone to know evil fully, without being hurt or defiled by it. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>I will put--Two oldest manuscripts have "I put," or "cast." One oldest manuscript reads as English Version. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>none other burden--save abstinence from, and protestation against, these abominations; no "depths" beyond your reach, such as they teach, no new doctrine, but the old faith and rule of practice once for all delivered to the saints. Exaggerating and perfecting Paul's doctrine of grace without the law as the source of justification and sanctification, these false prophets rejected the law as a rule of life, as though it were an intolerable "burden." But it is a "light" burden. In <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#028">Act 15:28-29</a>, the very term "burden," as here, is used of abstinence from fornication and idol-meats; to this the Lord here refers.

The Septuagint, pointing the Hebrew word differently, read as Revelation here. The English Version of <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#009">Psa 2:9</a> is doubtless right, as the parallel word, "dash in pieces," proves. But the Spirit in this case sanctions the additional thought as true, that the Lord shall mingle mercy to some, with judgment on others; beginning by destroying His Antichristian foes, He shall reign in love over the rest. "Christ shall rule them with a scepter of iron, to make them capable of being ruled with a scepter of gold; severity first, that grace may come after" (TRENCH, who thinks we ought to translate "SCEPTER" for "rod," as in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#008">Heb 1:8</a>). "Shepherd" is used in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#003">Jer 6:3</a>, of hostile rulers; so also in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#016">Zac 11:16</a>. As severity here is the primary thought, "rule as a shepherd" seems to me to be used thus: He who would have shepherded them with a pastoral rod, shall, because of their hardened unbelief, shepherd them with a rod of iron.

 </p><p>shall they be broken--So one oldest manuscript, Vulgate, Syriac, and Coptic Versions read. But two oldest manuscripts, read, "as the vessels of a potter are broken to shivers." A potter's vessel dashed to pieces, because of its failing to answer the design of the maker, is the image to depict God's sovereign power to give reprobates to destruction, not by caprice, but in the exercise of His righteous judgment. The saints shall be in Christ's victorious "armies" when He shall inflict the last decisive blow, and afterwards shall reign with Him. Having by faith "overcome the world," they shall also rule the world. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>even as I--"as I also have received of (from) My Father," namely, in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007">Psa 2:7-9</a>. Jesus had refused to receive the kingdom without the cross at Satan's hands; He would receive it from none but the Father, who had appointed the cross as the path to the crown. As the Father has given the authority to Me over the heathen and uttermost parts of the earth, so I impart a share of it to My victorious disciple.
