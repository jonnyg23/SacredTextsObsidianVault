 <p>
 </p><p>bring again the captivity--that is, reverse it. The Jews restrict this to the return from Babylon. Christians refer it to the coming of Christ. But the prophet comprises the whole redemption, beginning from the return out of Babylon, then continued from the first advent of Christ down to the last day (His second advent), when God will restore His Church to perfect felicity [CALVIN].

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">joe 3:2</a></font></span></p>Parallel to <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#002">Zac 14:2-4</a>, where the "Mount of Olives" answers to the "Valley of Jehoshaphat" here. The latter is called "the valley of blessing" (Berachah) (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#026">Ch2 20:26</a>). It lies between Jerusalem and the Mount of Olives and has the Kedron flowing through it. As Jehoshaphat overthrew the confederate foes of Judah, namely, Ammon, Moab, &amp;c. (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#006">Psa 83:6-8</a>), in this valley, so God was to overthrow the Tyrians, Zidonians, Philistines, Edom, and Egypt, with a similar utter overthrow (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#004">Joe 3:4</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#019">Joe 3:19</a>). This has been long ago fulfilled; but the ultimate event shadowed forth herein is still future, when God shall specially interpose to destroy Jerusalem's last foes, of whom Tyre, Zidon, Edom, Egypt, and Philistia are the types. As "Jehoshaphat" means "the judgment of Jehovah," the valley of Jehoshaphat may be used as a general term for the theater of God's final judgments on Israel's foes, with an allusion to the judgment inflicted on them by Jehoshaphat. The definite mention of the Mount of Olives in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#004">Zac 14:4</a>, and the fact that this was the scene of the ascension, makes it likely the same shall be the scene of Christ's coming again: compare "this same Jesus . . . shall so come in like manner as ye have seen Him go into heaven" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#011">Act 1:11</a>). 
 <p>

Implying that the source of Judah's redemption is God's free love, wherewith He chose Israel as His peculiar heritage, and at the same time assuring them, when desponding because of trials, that He would plead their cause as His own, and as if He were injured in their person.

 <p>
 </p><p>given a boy for . . . harlot--Instead of paying a harlot for her prostitution in money, they gave her a Jewish captive boy as a slave.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">joe 3:4</a></font></span></p>what have ye to do with me--Ye have no connection with Me (that is, with My people: God identifying Himself with Israel); I (that is, My people) have given you no cause of quarrel, why then do ye trouble Me (that is, My people)? (Compare the same phrase, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#024">Jos 22:24</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#012">Jdg 11:12</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#010">Sa2 16:10</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#029">Mat 8:29</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">joe 3:5</a></font></span></p>my silver . . . my gold--that is, the gold and silver of My people. The Philistines and Arabians had carried off all the treasures of King Jehoram's house (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#016">Ch2 21:16-17</a>). Compare also <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#018">Kg1 15:18</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#018">Kg2 12:18</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#014">Kg2 14:14</a>, for the spoiling of the treasures of the temple and the king's palace in Judah by Syria. It was customary among the heathen to hang up in the idol temples some of the spoils of war as presents to their gods.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#006">Joel 3:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">joe 3:6</a></font></span></p>Grecians--literally, "Javanites," that is, the Ionians, a Greek colony on the coast of Asia Minor who were the first Greeks known to the Jews. The Greeks themselves, however, in their original descent came from Javan (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#002">Gen 10:2</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#004">Gen 10:4</a>). Probably the germ of Greek civilization in part came through the Jewish slaves imported into Greece from PhÅnicia by traffickers. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#013">Eze 27:13</a> mentions Javan and Tyre as trading in the persons of men. 
 <p>
 </p><p>far from their border--far from Judea; so that the captive Jews were cut off from all hope of return.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">joe 3:7</a></font></span></p>raise them--that is, I will rouse them. Neither sea nor distance will prevent My bringing them back. Alexander, and his successors, restored to liberty many Jews in bondage in Greece [JOSEPHUS, Antiquities, 13.5; Wars of the Jews, 9,2].
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#008">Joel 3:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">joe 3:8</a></font></span></p>sell them to . . . Sabeans--The Persian Artaxerxes Mnemon and Darius Ochus, and chiefly the Greek Alexander, reduced the PhÅnician and Philistine powers. Thirty thousand Tyrians after the capture of Tyre by the last conqueror, and multitudes of Philistines on the taking of Gaza, were sold as slaves. The Jews are here said to do that which the God of Judah does in vindication of their wrong, namely, sell the PhÅnicians who sold them, to a people "far off," as was Greece, whither the Jews had been sold. The Sabeans at the most remote extremity of Arabia Felix are referred to (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#020">Jer 6:20</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#042">Mat 12:42</a>).
 <p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">joe 3:9</a></font></span></p>The nations hostile to Israel are summoned by Jehovah to "come up" (this phrase is used because Jerusalem was on a hill) against Jerusalem, not that they may destroy it, but to be destroyed by the Lord (Eze. 38:7-23; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#002">Zac 12:2-9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#002">Zac 14:2-3</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>Prepare war--literally, sanctify war: because the heathen always began war with religious ceremonies. The very phrase used of Babylon's preparations against Jerusalem (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#004">Jer 6:4</a>) is now used of the final foes of Jerusalem. As Babylon was then desired by God to advance against her for her destruction, so now all her foes, of whom Babylon was the type, are desired to advance against her for their own destruction.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">joe 3:10</a></font></span></p>Beat your ploughshares into swords--As the foes are desired to "beat their ploughshares into swords, and their pruning hooks into spears," that so they may perish in their unhallowed attack on Judah and Jerusalem, so these latter, and the nations converted to God by them, after the overthrow of the antichristian confederacy, shall, on the contrary, "beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruning hooks," when under Messiah's coming reign there shall be war no more (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#004">Isa 2:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#018">Hos 2:18</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#003">Mic 4:3</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>let the weak say, I am strong--So universal shall be the rage of Israel's foes for invading her, that even the weak among them will fancy themselves strong enough to join the invading forces. Age and infirmity were ordinarily made valid excuses for exemption from service, but so mad shall be the fury of the world against God's people, that even the feeble will not desire to be exempted (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001">Psa 2:1-3</a>).

 </p><p>
 </p><p>thy mighty ones--the warriors who fancy themselves "mighty ones," but who are on that very spot to be overthrown by Jehovah [MAURER]. Compare "the mighty men" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#009">Joe 3:9</a>). Rather, Joel speaks of God's really "mighty ones" in contrast to the self-styled "mighty men" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#009">Joe 3:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#020">Psa 103:20</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#003">Isa 13:3</a>; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#013">Dan 10:13</a>). AUBERLEN remarks: One prophet supplements the other, for they all prophesied only "in part." What was obscure to one was revealed to the other; what is briefly described by one is more fully so by another. Daniel calls Antichrist a king, and dwells on his worldly conquests; John looks more to his spiritual tyranny, for which reason he adds a second beast, wearing the semblance of spirituality. Antichrist himself is described by Daniel. Isaiah (Isa. 29:1-24), Joel (Joel 3:1-21) describe his army of heathen followers coming up against Jerusalem, but not Antichrist himself.

The same as "the valley of Jehoshaphat," that is, "the valley of judgment" (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#002">Joe 3:2</a>). Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#012">Joe 3:12</a>, "there will I sit to judge," which confirms English Version rather than Margin, "threshing." The repetition of "valley of decision" heightens the effect and pronounces the awful certainty of their doom.

The victories of the Jews over their cruel foe Antiochus, under the Maccabees, may be a reference of this prophecy; but the ultimate reference is to the last Antichrist, of whom Antiochus was the type.
