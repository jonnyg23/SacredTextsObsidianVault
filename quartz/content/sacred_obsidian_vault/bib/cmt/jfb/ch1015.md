 <p>
 </p><p>David made him houses in the city of David--Through the liberality of his Tyrian ally (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#001">Ch1 14:1</a>), David was enabled to erect not only a palace for himself, but to furnish suitable accommodation for his numerous family. Where polygamy prevails, each wife has a separate house or suite of apartments for herself and children. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent--that is, made an entirely new one upon the model of the former. The old tabernacle, which Moses had constructed in the wilderness and which had hitherto served the purpose of a sacred covering, was to be left at Gibeon, either because of the unwillingness of the inhabitants to part with such a venerable relic, or because there was no use for it in Jerusalem, where a more solid and sumptuous edifice was contemplated. If it appear surprising that David "made him houses" before he prepared this new tabernacle, it should be remembered that he had received no divine intimation respecting such a work.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">ch1 15:2</a></font></span></p>Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites--After the lapse of three months (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#014">Ch1 13:14</a>) the purpose of transporting the ark to Jerusalem was resumed. Time and reflection had led to a discovery of the cause of the painful catastrophe that marred the first attempt. In preparing for the solemn procession that was now to usher the sacred symbol into its resting-place, David took special care that the carriage should be regulated in strict conformity to the law (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#005">Num 4:5</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#015">Num 4:15</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#009">Num 7:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#017">Num 10:17</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">ch1 15:3</a></font></span></p>David gathered all Israel together--Some are of opinion that this was done on one of the three great festivals, but at whatever time the ceremonial took place, it was of great importance to summon a general convocation of the people, many of whom, from the long-continued disorders of the kingdom, might have had little or no opportunity of knowing anything of the ark, which had been allowed to remain so long in obscurity and neglect.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#004">1 Chronicles 15:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">ch1 15:4</a></font></span></p>David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites--The children of Aaron were the two priests (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#011">Ch1 15:11</a>), Zadok and Abiathar, heads of the two priestly houses of Eleazar and Ithamar, and colleagues in the high priesthood (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#025">Sa2 20:25</a>). The Levites were the chiefs of their father's house (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#012">Ch1 15:12</a>); four belonging to the Kohathite branch, on whose shoulders the ark was to be borne; namely, Uriel, Shemaiah--descended from Elizaphan or Elzaphan-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#022">Exo 6:22</a>), Hebron (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#018">Exo 6:18</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#002">Ch1 6:2</a>), and Amminadab from Uzziel (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#022">Exo 6:22</a>).
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#012">1 Chronicles 15:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">ch1 15:12</a></font></span></p>sanctify yourselves--This special sanctification, which was required on all grave and important occasions, consisted in observing the strictest abstinence, as well as cleanliness, both in person and dress (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#002">Gen 35:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#010">Exo 19:10</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#015">Exo 19:15</a>); and in the neglect of these rules no step could have been taken (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#003">Ch2 30:3</a>).
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#016">1 Chronicles 15:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">ch1 15:16</a></font></span></p>David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint . . . the singers with instruments--These eminent Levites were instructed to train the musicians and singers who were under them, for the solemn procession. The performers were ranged in three choirs or bands, and the names of the principal leaders are given (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#017">Ch1 15:17-18</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#021">Ch1 15:21</a>), with the instruments respectively used by each. "Ben" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#018">Ch1 15:18</a>) is omitted (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#020">Ch1 15:20</a>). Either it was used merely as a common noun, to intimate that Zechariah was the son of Jaaziel or Aziel, or Ben is the same as Azaziah [<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#021">Ch1 15:21</a>].

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">ch1 15:22</a></font></span></p>Chenaniah, chief of the Levites--He was not of the six heads of the Levitical families, but a chief in consequence of his office, which required learning, without regard to birth or family. 
 <p>
 </p><p>instructed about the song--He directed all these bands as to the proper time when each was to strike in or change their notes; or, as some render the passage, "He led the burdens, for he was skilled," that is, in the custom which it was necessary to observe in the carriage of the holy things [BERTHEAU].

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">ch1 15:23</a></font></span></p>Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers--who marched immediately in front, while Obed-edom and Jeiel went in the rear, of the ark.

 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#025">1 Chronicles 15:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">ch1 15:25</a></font></span></p>So David, and the elders . . . and captains . . . went--The pious design of David in ordering all his principal ministers and officers to take part in this solemn work and imparting so much pomp and imposing ceremony to the procession, was evidently to inspire the popular mind with a profound veneration for the ark and to give the young especially salutary impressions of religion, which would be renewed by the remembrance that they had been witnesses of the august solemnity in which the king and the highest aristocracy of the land participated, vying with all other classes to do honor to the God of Israel.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#026">1 Chronicles 15:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">ch1 15:26</a></font></span></p>it came to pass, &amp;c.--(See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#013">Sa2 6:13-23</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>they offered seven bullocks and seven rams--The Levites seem to have entered on this duty with fear and trembling; and finding that they might advance without any such indications of divine wrath as Uzza had experienced (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#010">Ch1 13:10</a>), they offered an ox and a fatted sheep immediately after starting (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#013">Sa2 6:13</a>), and seven bullocks and seven rams--a perfect sacrifice, at the close of the procession (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#001">Ch1 16:1</a>). It is probable that preparations had been made for the offering of similar sacrifices at regular intervals along the way.
 </p><p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">ch1 15:27</a></font></span></p>a robe of fine linen--Hebrew, Butz--is rather supposed in the later books to denote cotton. 
 <p>
 </p><p>an ephod--a shoulder-garment, a cincture or cape over his dress. It was worn by the priests, but was not so peculiar to them as to be forbidden others (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#018">Sa1 2:18</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#018">Sa1 22:18</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">ch1 15:29</a></font></span></p>Michal . . . saw . . . David dancing and playing--His movements would be slow and solemn, suitable to the grave and solemn character of the music. Though his royal robes were laid aside, he was attired like the other officials, showing a becoming humility in the immediate presence of God. The feelings manifested by Michal were only an ebullition of spleen from a proud and passionate woman.
