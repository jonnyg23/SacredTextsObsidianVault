Fausset and David Brown [1882] at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#001">Ecclesiastes Chapter 7</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#001">Ecclesiastes 7:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">ecc 7:1</a></font></span></p>(Ecc. 7:1-29)
 <p>
 </p><p>(See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#012">Ecc 6:12</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>name--character; a godly mind and life; not mere reputation with man, but what a man is in the eyes of God, with whom the name and reality are one thing (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006">Isa 9:6</a>). This alone is "good," while all else is "vanity" when made the chief end. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>ointment--used lavishly at costly banquets and peculiarly refreshing in the sultry East. The Hebrew for "name" and for "ointment," have a happy paronomasia, Sheem and Shemen. "Ointment" is fragrant only in the place where the person is whose head and garment are scented, and only for a time. The "name" given by God to His child (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#012">Rev 3:12</a>) is for ever and in all lands. So in the case of the woman who received an everlasting name from Jesus Christ, in reward for her precious ointment (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#005">Isa 56:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#003">Mar 14:3-9</a>). Jesus Christ Himself hath such a name, as the Messiah, equivalent to Anointed (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#003">Sol 1:3</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and the day of [his] death, &amp;c.--not a general censure upon God for creating man; but, connected with the previous clause, death is to him, who hath a godly name, "better" than the day of his birth; "far better," as <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#023">Phi 1:23</a> has it.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#002">Ecclesiastes 7:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">ecc 7:2</a></font></span></p>Proving that it is not a sensual enjoyment of earthly goods which is meant in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#013">Ecc 3:13</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#018">Ecc 5:18</a>. A thankful use of these is right, but frequent feasting Solomon had found dangerous to piety in his own case. So Job's fear (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#004">Ecc 1:4-5</a>). The house of feasting often shuts out thoughts of God and eternity. The sight of the dead in the "house of mourning" causes "the living" to think of their own "end."
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#003">Ecclesiastes 7:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">ecc 7:3</a></font></span></p>Sorrow--such as arises from serious thoughts of eternity. 
 <p>
 </p><p>laughter--reckless mirth (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#002">Ecc 2:2</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>by the sadness . . . better-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#005">Psa 126:5-6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#017">Co2 4:17</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#010">Heb 12:10-11</a>). MAURER translates: "In sadness of countenance there is (may be) a good (cheerful) heart." So Hebrew, for "good," equivalent to "cheerful" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#009">Ecc 11:9</a>); but the parallel clause supports English Version.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#005">Ecclesiastes 7:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">ecc 7:5</a></font></span></p>(<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#004">Psa 141:4-5</a>). Godly reproof offends the flesh, but benefits the spirit. Fools' songs in the house of mirth please the flesh, but injure the soul.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#006">Ecclesiastes 7:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">ecc 7:6</a></font></span></p>crackling--answers to the loud merriment of fools. It is the very fire consuming them which produces the seeming merry noise (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#005">Joe 2:5</a>). Their light soon goes out in the black darkness. There is a paronomasia in the Hebrew, Sirim ("thorns"), Sir ("pot"). The wicked are often compared to "thorns" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#006">Sa2 23:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#010">Nah 1:10</a>). Dried cow-dung was the common fuel in Palestine; its slowness in burning makes the quickness of a fire of thorns the more graphic, as an image of the sudden end of fools (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#012">Psa 118:12</a>).
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#007">Ecclesiastes 7:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">ecc 7:7</a></font></span></p>oppression--recurring to the idea (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#016">Ecc 3:16</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#008">Ecc 5:8</a>). Its connection with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#004">Ecc 7:4-6</a> is, the sight of "oppression" perpetrated by "fools" might tempt the "wise" to call in question God's dispensations, and imitate the folly (equivalent to "madness") described (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#005">Ecc 7:5</a>,6). WEISS, for "oppression," translates, "distraction," produced by merriment. But <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#008">Ecc 5:8</a> favors English Version. 
 <p>
 </p><p>a gift--that is, the sight of bribery in "places of judgment" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#016">Ecc 3:16</a>) might cause the wise to lose their wisdom (equivalent to "heart"), (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#006">Job 12:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#006">Job 21:6-7</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#001">Job 24:1</a>, &amp;c.). This suits the parallelism better than "a heart of gifts"; a benevolent heart, as WEISS.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#008">Ecclesiastes 7:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">ecc 7:8</a></font></span></p>connected with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#007">Ecc 7:7</a>. Let the "wise" wait for "the end," and the "oppressions" which now (in "the beginning") perplex their faith, will be found by God's working to be overruled to their good. "Tribulation worketh patience" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#003">Rom 5:3</a>), which is infinitely better than "the proud spirit" that prosperity might have generated in them, as it has in fools (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#002">Psa 73:2-3</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#012">Psa 73:12-14</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#017">Psa 73:17-26</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#011">Jam 5:11</a>).
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#009">Ecclesiastes 7:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">ecc 7:9</a></font></span></p>angry--impatient at adversity befalling thee, as Job was (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#002">Ecc 5:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#016">Pro 12:16</a>).

 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#011">Ecclesiastes 7:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">ecc 7:11</a></font></span></p>Rather, "Wisdom, as compared with an inheritance, is good," that is, is as good as an inheritance; "yea, better (literally, and a profit) to them that see the sun" (that is, the living, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#007">Ecc 11:7</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#016">Job 3:16</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#019">Psa 49:19</a>).

 <p>
 </p><p>is, that--rather, "the excellency of the knowledge of wisdom giveth life," that is, life in the highest sense, here and hereafter (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#018">Pro 3:18</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#003">Joh 17:3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#003">Pe2 1:3</a>). Wisdom (religion) cannot be lost as money can. It shields one in adversity, as well as prosperity; money, only in prosperity. The question in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#010">Ecc 7:10</a> implies a want of it.
 </p><p>

"Consider," that is, regard it as "the work of God"; for "God has made (Hebrew, for 'set') this (adversity) also as well as the other (prosperity)." "Adversity" is one of the things which "God has made crooked," and which man cannot "make straight." He ought therefore to be "patient" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#008">Ecc 7:8</a>). 
 <p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">ecc 7:16</a></font></span></p>HOLDEN makes <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#016">Ecc 7:16</a> the scoffing inference of the objector, and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#017">Ecc 7:17</a> the answer of Solomon, now repentant. So (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#032">Co1 15:32</a>) the skeptic's objection; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#033">Co1 15:33</a>) the answer. However, "Be not righteous over much," may be taken as Solomon's words, forbidding a self-made righteousness of outward performances, which would wrest salvation from God, instead of receiving it as the gift of His grace. It is a fanatical, pharisaical righteousness, separated from God; for the "fear of God" is in antithesis to it (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#018">Ecc 7:18</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#003">Ecc 5:3</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#007">Ecc 5:7</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#001">Mat 6:1-7</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#014">Mat 9:14</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#023">Mat 23:23-24</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#003">Rom 10:3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#003">Ti1 4:3</a>).

 </p><p>
 </p><p>destroy thyself--expose thyself to needless persecution, austerities and the wrath of God; hence to an untimely death. "Destroy thyself" answers to "perisheth" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#015">Ecc 7:15</a>); "righteous over much," to "a just man." Therefore in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#015">Ecc 7:15</a> it is self-justiciary, not a truly righteous man, that is meant.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#017">Ecclesiastes 7:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">ecc 7:17</a></font></span></p>over much wicked--so worded, to answer to "righteous over much." For if not taken thus, it would seem to imply that we may be wicked a little. "Wicked" refers to "wicked man" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#015">Ecc 7:15</a>); "die before thy time," to "prolongeth his life," antithetically. There may be a wicked man spared to "live long," owing to his avoiding gross excesses (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#015">Ecc 7:15</a>). Solomon says, therefore, Be not so foolish (answering antithetically to "over wise," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#016">Ecc 7:16</a>), as to run to such excess of riot, that God will be provoked to cut off prematurely thy day of grace (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#005">Rom 2:5</a>). The precept is addressed to a sinner. Beware of aggravating thy sin, so as to make thy case desperate. It refers to the days of Solomon's "vanity" (apostasy, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#015">Ecc 7:15</a>), when only such a precept would be applicable. By litotes it includes, "Be not wicked at all."

 </p><p>wickedness of folly--He is now a step further on the path of penitence than in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#017">Ecc 1:17</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#012">Ecc 2:12</a>, where "folly" is put without "wickedness" prefixed. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>reason--rather, "the right estimation" of things. HOLDEN translates also "foolishness (that is, sinful folly, answering to 'wickedness' in the parallel) of madness" (that is, of man's mad pursuits).

As "God's favor is better than life," she who seduces from God is "more bitter than death." 
 <p>
 </p><p>whoso pleaseth God--as Joseph (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#002">Gen 39:2-3</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#009">Gen 39:9</a>). It is God's grace alone that keeps any from falling.

 <p>
 </p><p>counting one by one--by comparing one thing with another [HOLDEN and MAURER]. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>account--a right estimate. But <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#028">Ecc 7:28</a> more favors GESENIUS. "Considering women one by one."

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_028">ecc 7:28</a></font></span></p>Rather, referring to his past experience, "Which my soul sought further, but I found not." 
 <p>
 </p><p>one man--that is, worthy of the name, "man," "upright"; not more than one in a thousand of my courtiers (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#023">Job 33:23</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#001">Psa 12:1</a>). Jesus Christ alone of men fully realizes the perfect ideal of "man." "Chiefest among ten thousand" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#010">Sol 5:10</a>). No perfect "woman" has ever existed, not even the Virgin Mary. Solomon, in the word "thousand," alludes to his three hundred wives and seven hundred concubines. Among these it was not likely that he should find the fidelity which one true wife pays to one husband. Connected with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#026">Ecc 7:26</a>, not an unqualified condemnation of the sex, as <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#004">Pro 12:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#010">Pro 31:10</a>, &amp;c., prove.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">ecc 7:29</a></font></span></p>The "only" way of accounting for the scarcity of even comparatively upright men and women is that, whereas God made man upright, they (men) have, &amp;c. The only account to be "found" of the origin of evil, the great mystery of theology, is that given in Holy Writ (Gen. 2:1-3:24). Among man's "inventions" was the one especially referred to in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#026">Ecc 7:26</a>, the bitter fruits of which Solomon experienced, the breaking of God's primeval marriage law, joining one man to "one" woman (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#004">Mat 19:4-6</a>). "Man" is singular, namely, Adam; "they," plural, Adam, Eve, and their posterity.
