Various titles have been given them; in the Septuagint and the Vulgate they are called the Third and Fourth Books of Kings. The authorship of these books is unknown; but the prevailing opinion is that they were compiled by Ezra, or one of the later prophets, from the ancient documents that are so frequently referred to in the course of the history as of public and established authority. Their inspired character was acknowledged by the Jewish Church, which ranked them in the sacred canon; and, besides, it is attested by our Lord, who frequently quotes from them (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#009">Kg1 17:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#014">Kg2 5:14</a> with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#024">Luk 4:24-27</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#001">Kg1 10:1</a> with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#042">Mat 12:42</a>).
