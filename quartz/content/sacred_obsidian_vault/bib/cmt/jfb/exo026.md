 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_036">exo 26:36</a></font></span></p>an hanging for the door of the tent--Curtains of rich and elaborate embroidery, made by the women, are suspended over the doors or entrances of the tents occupied by Eastern chiefs and princes. In a similar style of elegance was the hanging finished which was to cover the door of this tabernacle--the chosen habitation of the God and King of Israel. It appears from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#012">Exo 26:12</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#022">Exo 26:22-23</a>, that the ark and mercy seat were placed in the west end of the tabernacle, and consequently the door or entrance fronted the east, so that the Israelites in worshipping Jehovah, turned their faces towards the west; that they might be thus figuratively taught to turn from the worship of that luminary which was the great idol of the nations, and to adore the God who made it and them [HEWLETT].
