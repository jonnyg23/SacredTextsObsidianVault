Call on Him, according to His historically manifested glory. After the example of Abraham, who, as often as God acquired for Himself a name in guiding him, called in solemn worship upon the name of the Lord (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#008">Gen 12:8</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#004">Gen 13:4</a>).

His title, "JEHOVAH," implies that He, the unchangeable, self-existing Being, makes things to be, that is, fulfils His promises, and therefore will not forsake His people.

Out of the whole storehouse of the promises of God, only one is prominently brought forward, namely, that concerning the possession of Canaan [<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#011">Psa 105:11</a>]. Everything revolves around this. The wonders and judgments have all for their ultimate design the fulfilment of this promise.
 <p>

 <p>
 </p><p>yea, very few--literally, "as a few," that is, like fewness itself (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#009">Isa 1:9</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>strangers--sojourners in the land of their future inheritance, as in a strange country (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#009">Heb 11:9</a>).

 <p>

 </p><p>
 </p><p>my prophets--in a similar sense, compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#007">Gen 20:7</a>. The "anointed" are those vessels of God, consecrated to His service, "in whom (as Pharaoh said of Joseph, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#038">Gen 41:38</a>) the Spirit of God is" [HENGSTENBERG].

The "soul" is put for the whole person, because the soul of the captive suffers still more than the body. Joseph is referred to as being an appropriate type of those "bound in affliction and iron" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#010">Psa 107:10</a>).
 </p><p>

It refers to <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#018">Psa 105:18</a>. The soul that was once bound itself now binds others, even princes. The same moral binding is assigned to the saints (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#008">Psa 149:8</a>).

"When Saul had turned his back to go from (God's prophet) Samuel, God turned (Margin) him another heart" (see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#008">Exo 1:8</a>, &amp;c.). Whatever evil the wicked man plots against God's people, God holds bound even his heart, so as not to lay a single plan except what God permits. Thus Isaiah (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#017">Isa 43:17</a>) says it was God who brought forth the army of Pharaoh to pursue Israel to their own destruction (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#021">Exo 4:21</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#003">Exo 7:3</a>).

 <p>
 </p><p>they rebelled not--Moses and Aaron promptly obeyed God (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#027">Heb 11:27</a>); (compare Exo. 7:1-11:10 and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#044">Psa 78:44-51</a>, with which this summary substantially agrees). Or, rather, the "darkness" here is figurative (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#016">Jer 13:16</a>), the literal plague of darkness (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#022">Exo 10:22-23</a>) being only alluded to as the symbol of God's wrath which overhung Egypt as a dark cloud during all the plagues. Hence, it is placed first, out of the historical order. Thus, "They rebelled not (that is, no longer) against His word," refers to the Egyptians. Whenever God sent a plague on them, they were ready to let Israel go, though refusing when the plague ceased. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>his word--His command to let Israel go [HENGSTENBERG]. Of the ten plagues, only eight are mentioned, the fifth, the murrain of beasts, and the sixth, the boils, being omitted.
 </p><p>

His "gift" to Israel's foes is one of a very different kind from that bestowed on His people. 
 <p>
 </p><p>hail for rain--instead of fertilizing showers, hail destructive to trees. This forms the transition to the vegetable kingdom. The locusts in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#034">Psa 105:34</a> similarly are destructive to plants.

(2) That they might be obedient. The observance of God's commands by Abraham was the object of the covenant with him (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#019">Gen 18:19</a>), as it was also the object of the covenant with Israel, that they might observe God's statutes.
