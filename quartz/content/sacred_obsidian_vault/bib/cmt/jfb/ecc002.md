"Wisdom" (worldly common sense, sagacity), which still "remained with me" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#009">Ecc 2:9</a>), showed me that these could not give solid happiness.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#012">Ecclesiastes 2:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">ecc 2:12</a></font></span></p>He had tried (worldly) wisdom (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#012">Ecc 1:12-18</a>) and folly (foolish pleasure) (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#001">Ecc 2:1-11</a>); he now compares them (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#012">Ecc 2:12</a>) and finds that while (worldly) 
 <p>
 </p><p>wisdom excelleth folly (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#013">Ecc 2:13-14</a>), yet the one event, death, befalls both (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#014">Ecc 2:14-16</a>), and that thus the wealth acquired by the wise man's "labor" may descend to a "fool" that hath not labored (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#018">Ecc 2:18-19</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#021">Ecc 2:21</a>); therefore all his labor is vanity (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#022">Ecc 2:22-23</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>what can the man do . . . already done-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#009">Ecc 1:9</a>). Parenthetical. A future investigator can strike nothing out "new," so as to draw a different conclusion from what I draw by comparing "wisdom and madness." HOLDEN, with less ellipsis, translates, "What, O man, shall come after the king?" &amp;c. Better, GROTIUS, "What man can come after (compete with) the king in the things which are done?" None ever can have the same means of testing what all earthly things can do towards satisfying the soul; namely, worldly wisdom, science, riches, power, longevity, all combined.

The worldly "wise" man has good sense in managing his affairs, skill and taste in building and planting, and keeps within safe and respectable bounds in pleasure, while the "fool" is wanting in these respects ("darkness," equivalent to fatal error, blind infatuation), yet one event, death, happens to both (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#026">Job 21:26</a>).

 <p>
 </p><p>Then--Since such is the case. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>this--namely, pursuit of (worldly) wisdom; it can never fill the place of the true wisdom (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#028">Job 28:28</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#009">Jer 8:9</a>).

For selfishness is mostly at the root of worldly parents' alleged providence for their children. But now the remembrance of how he himself, the piously reared child of David, had disregarded his father's dying charge (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#009">Ch1 28:9</a>), suggested the sad misgivings as to what Rehoboam, his son by an idolatrous Ammonitess, Naamah, should prove to be; a foreboding too fully realized (1Ki. 12:1-18; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#021">Kg1 14:21-31</a>).

 </p><p>
 </p><p>evil--not in itself, for this is the ordinary course of things, but "evil," as regards the chief good, that one should have toiled so fruitlessly.

 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#024">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">ecc 2:24</a></font></span></p>English Version gives a seemingly Epicurean sense, contrary to the general scope. The Hebrew, literally is, "It is not good for man that he should eat," &amp;c., "and should make his soul see good" (or "show his soul, that is, himself, happy"), &amp;c. [WEISS]. According to HOLDEN and WEISS, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#012">Ecc 3:12</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#022">Ecc 3:22</a> differ from this verse in the text and meaning; here he means, "It is not good that a man should feast himself, and falsely make as though his soul were happy"; he thus refers to a false pretending of happiness acquired by and for one's self; in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#012">Ecc 3:12</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#022">Ecc 3:22</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#018">Ecc 5:18-19</a>, to real seeing, or finding pleasure when God gives it. There it is said to be good for a man to enjoy with satisfaction and thankfulness the blessings which God gives; here it is said not to be good to take an unreal pleasure to one's self by feasting, &amp;c. 
 <p>
 </p><p>This also I saw--I perceived by experience that good (real pleasure) is not to be taken at will, but comes only from the hand of God [WEISS] (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#006">Psa 4:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#019">Isa 57:19-21</a>). Or as HOLDEN, "It is the appointment from the hand of God, that the sensualist has no solid satisfaction" (good).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#025">Ecclesiastes 2:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">ecc 2:25</a></font></span></p>hasten--after indulgences (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#023">Pro 7:23</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#002">Pro 19:2</a>), eagerly pursue such enjoyments. None can compete with me in this. If I, then, with all my opportunities of enjoyment, failed utterly to obtain solid pleasure of my own making, apart from God, who else can? God mercifully spares His children the sad experiment which Solomon made, by denying them the goods which they often desire. He gives them the fruits of Solomon's experience, without their paying the dear price at which Solomon bought it.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#026">Ecclesiastes 2:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">ecc 2:26</a></font></span></p>True, literally, in the Jewish theocracy; and in some measure in all ages (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#016">Job 27:16-17</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#022">Pro 13:22</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#008">Pro 28:8</a>). Though the retribution be not so visible and immediate now as then, it is no less real. Happiness even here is more truly the portion of the godly (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#011">Psa 84:11</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#005">Mat 5:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#029">Mar 10:29-30</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#028">Rom 8:28</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#008">Ti1 4:8</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>that he--the sinner 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>may give--that is, unconsciously and in spite of himself. The godly Solomon had satisfaction in his riches and wisdom, when God gave them (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#011">Ch2 1:11-12</a>). The backsliding Solomon had no happiness when he sought it in them apart from God; and the riches which he heaped up became the prey of Shishak (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#009">Ch2 12:9</a>).
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Earthly pursuits are no doubt lawful in their proper time and order (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#001">Ecc 3:1-8</a>), but unprofitable when out of time and place; as for instance, when pursued as the solid and chief good (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#009">Ecc 3:9-10</a>); whereas God makes everything beautiful in its season, which man obscurely comprehends (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#011">Ecc 3:11</a>). God allows man to enjoy moderately and virtuously His earthly gifts (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#012">Ecc 3:12-13</a>). What consoles us amidst the instability of earthly blessings is, God's counsels are immutable (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#014">Ecc 3:14</a>).
