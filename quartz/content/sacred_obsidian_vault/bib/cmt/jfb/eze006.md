 <p>
 </p><p>mountains of Israel--that is, of Palestine in general. The mountains are addressed by personification; implying that the Israelites themselves are incurable and unworthy of any more appeals; so the prophet sent to Jeroboam did not deign to address the king, but addressed the altar (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#002">Kg1 13:2</a>). The mountains are specified as being the scene of Jewish idolatries on "the high places" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#003">Eze 6:3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#030">Lev 26:30</a>).

Others translate it, "sun images"; and so in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#006">Eze 6:6</a> (see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#011">Kg2 23:11</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#004">Ch2 34:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#008">Isa 17:8</a>, Margin).

This partially took place in the complete eradication of idolatry from the Jews ever since the Babylonian captivity. But they have yet to repent of their crowning sin, the crucifixion of Messiah; their full repentance is therefore future, after the ordeal of trials for many centuries, ending with that foretold in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#009">Zac 10:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#008">Zac 13:8-9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#001">Zac 14:1-4</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#011">Zac 14:11</a>.

 <p>
 </p><p>I am broken with their whorish heart--FAIRBAIRN translates, actively, "I will break" their whorish heart; English Version is better. In their exile they shall remember how long I bore with them, but was at last compelled to punish, after I was "broken" (My long-suffering wearied out) by their desperate (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#039">Num 15:39</a>) spiritual whorishness [CALVIN], (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#040">Psa 78:40</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#013">Isa 7:13</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#024">Isa 43:24</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#010">Isa 63:10</a>).

They shall not wait for men to condemn them but shall condemn themselves (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#043">Eze 20:43</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#031">Eze 36:31</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#006">Job 42:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#031">Co1 11:31</a>).

In indignation at the abominations of Israel extend thine hand towards Judea, as if about to "strike," and "stamp," shaking off the dust with thy foot, in token of how God shall "stretch out His hand upon them," and tread them down (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#014">Eze 6:14</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#014">Eze 21:14</a>).

Distinct from "he that is near," namely, those outside the city who are within reach of "the sword" of the foe, and so fall by it; not by "famine," as those left in the city.
