 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#001">Psalms 106:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">psa 106:1</a></font></span></p>This Psalm gives a detailed confession of the sins of Israel in all periods of their history, with special reference to the terms of the covenant as intimated (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#045">Psa 105:45</a>). It is introduced by praise to God for the wonders of His mercy, and concluded by a supplication for His favor to His afflicted people, and a doxology. (Psa. 106:1-48)
 <p>
 </p><p>Praise, &amp;c.--(See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#035">Psa 104:35</a>), begins and ends the Psalm, intimating the obligations of praise, however we sin and suffer <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#034">Ch1 16:34-36</a> is the source from which the beginning and end of this Psalm are derived.

Their unutterable greatness is not to keep us back, but to urge us the more to try to praise Him as best we can (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#005">Psa 40:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#015">Psa 71:15</a>).

Their rebellion at the sea (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#011">Exo 14:11</a>) was because they had not remembered nor understood God's miracles on their behalf.

 </p><p>the sea . . . the Red Sea--the very words in which Moses' song celebrated the scene of Israel's deliverance (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#004">Exo 15:4</a>). Israel began to rebel against God at the very moment and scene of its deliverance by God!

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">psa 106:13</a></font></span></p>The faith induced by God's display of power in their behalf was short lived, and their new rebellion and temptation was visited by God with fresh punishment, inflicted by leaving them to the result of their own gratified appetites, and sending on them spiritual poverty (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#018">Num 11:18</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>They soon forgat--literally, "They hasted, they forgat" (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#008">Exo 32:8</a>). "They have turned aside quickly (or, hastily) out of the way." The haste of our desires is such that we can scarcely allow God one day. Unless He immediately answers our call, instantly then arise impatience, and at length despair. 
 </p><p>

 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#014">Psalms 106:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">psa 106:14</a></font></span></p>Literally, "lusted a lust" (quoted from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#004">Num 11:4</a>, Margin). Previously, there had been impatience as to necessaries of life; here it is lusting (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#018">Psa 78:18</a>).
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#015">Psalms 106:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">psa 106:15</a></font></span></p>but sent leanness--rather, "and sent," that is, and thus, even in doing so, the punishment was inflicted at the very time their request was granted. So <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#030">Psa 78:30</a>, "While their meat was yet in their mouths, the wrath of God came upon them." 
 <p>
 </p><p>soul--the animal soul, which craves for food (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#006">Num 11:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#018">Psa 107:18</a>). This soul got its wish, and with it and in it its own punishment. The place was therefore called Kibroth-hattaavah, "the graves of lust" [<a href="../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#034">Num 11:34</a>], because there they buried the people who had lusted. Animal desires when gratified mostly give only a hungry craving for more (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#013">Jer 2:13</a>).
 </p><p>

 <p>
 </p><p>Aaron the saint--literally, "the holy one," as consecrated priest; not a moral attribute, but one designating his office as holy to the Lord. The rebellion was followed by a double punishment: (1) of the non-Levitical rebels, the Reubenites, Dathan and Abiram, &amp;c. (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#006">Deu 11:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#010">Num 26:10</a>); these were swallowed up by the earth.

(2) Of the Levitical rebels, with Korah at their head (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#035">Num 16:35</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#010">Num 26:10</a>); these had sinned by fire, and were punished by fire, as Aaron's (being high priest) sons had been (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#002">Lev 10:2</a>; Num. 16:1-35).

 </p><p>
 </p><p>calf--called so in contempt. They would have made an ox or bull, but their idol turned out but a calf; an imitation of the divine symbols, the cherubim; or of the sacred bull of Egyptian idolatry. The idolatry was more sinful in view of their recent experience of God's power in Egypt and His wonders at Sinai (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#001">Exo 32:1-6</a>). Though intending to worship Jehovah under the symbol of the calf, yet as this was incompatible with His nature (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#015">Deu 4:15-17</a>), they in reality gave up Him, and so were given up by Him. Instead of the Lord of heaven, they had as their glory the image of an ox that does nothing but eat grass.

Their apostasies ungratefully repaid God's many mercies till He finally abandoned them to punishment (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#039">Lev 26:39</a>).
