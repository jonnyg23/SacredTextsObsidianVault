 <p>
 </p><p>over the brook Kedron--a deep, dark ravine, to the northeast of Jerusalem, through which flowed this small storm brook or winter torrent, and which in summer is dried up. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>where was a garden--at the foot of the Mount of Olives, "called Gethsemane; that is, olive press (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#030">Mat 26:30</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#036">Mat 26:36</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#002">John 18:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">joh 18:2</a></font></span></p>Judas . . . knew the place, for Jesus ofttimes--see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#001">Joh 8:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#037">Luk 21:37</a>. 
 <p>
 </p><p>resorted thither with his disciples--The baseness of this abuse of knowledge in Judas, derived from admission to the closest privacies of his Master, is most touchingly conveyed here, though nothing beyond bare narrative is expressed. Jesus, however, knowing that in this spot Judas would expect to find Him, instead of avoiding it, hies Him thither, as a Lamb to the slaughter. "No man taketh My life from Me, but I lay it down of Myself" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#018">Joh 10:18</a>). Besides, the scene which was to fill up the little breathing-time, the awful interval, between the Supper and the Apprehension--like the "silence in heaven for about the space of half an hour" between the breaking of the Apocalyptic Seals and the peal of the Trumpets of war (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#001">Rev 8:1</a>) --the AGONY--would have been too terrible for the upper room; nor would He cloud the delightful associations of the last Passover and the first Supper by pouring out the anguish of His soul there. The garden, however, with its amplitude, its shady olives, its endeared associations, would be congenial to His heart. Here He had room enough to retire--first, from eight of them, and then from the more favored three; and here, when that mysterious scene was over, the stillness would only be broken by the tread of the traitor.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#003">John 18:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">joh 18:3</a></font></span></p>Judas then--"He that was called Judas, one of the Twelve," says Luke (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#047">Luk 22:47</a>), in language which brands him with peculiar infamy, as in the sacred circle while in no sense of it. 
 <p>
 </p><p>a band of men--"the detachment of the Roman cohort on duty at the festival for the purpose of maintaining order" [WEBSTER and WILKINSON]. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>officers from the chief priests and Pharisees--captains of the temple and armed Levites. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>lanterns and torches--It was full moon, but in case He should have secreted Himself somewhere in the dark ravine, they bring the means of exploring its hiding-places--little knowing whom they had to do with. "Now he that betrayed Him had given them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is He, hold Him fast" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#048">Mat 26:48</a>). The cold-bloodedness of this speech was only exceeded by the deed itself. "And Judas went before them [<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#047">Luk 22:47</a>], and forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, Master, and kissed Him" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#049">Mat 26:49</a>; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#027">Exo 4:27</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#007">Exo 18:7</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#045">Luk 7:45</a>). The impudence of this atrocious deed shows how thoroughly he had by this time mastered all his scruples. If the dialogue between our Lord and His captors was before this, as some interpreters think it was, the kiss of Judas was purely gratuitous, and probably to make good his right to the money; our Lord having presented Himself unexpectedly before them, and rendered it unnecessary for any one to point Him out. But a comparison of the narratives seems to show that our Lord's "coming forth" to the band was subsequent to the interview of Judas. "And Jesus said unto him, Friend"--not the endearing term "friend" (in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#015">Joh 15:15</a>), but "companion," a word used on occasions of remonstrance or rebuke (as in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#013">Mat 20:13</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#012">Mat 22:12</a>) --"Wherefore art thou come?" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#050">Mat 26:50</a>). "Betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss"--imprinting upon the foulest act the mark of tenderest affection? What wounded feeling does this express! Of this Jesus showed Himself on various occasions keenly susceptible--as all generous and beautiful natures do.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#004">John 18:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">joh 18:4</a></font></span></p>Jesus . . . knowing all things that should come--were coming. 
 <p>
 </p><p>upon him, went forth--from the shade of the trees, probably, into open view, indicating His sublime preparedness to meet His captors. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Whom seek ye?--partly to prevent a rush of the soldiery upon the disciples [BENGEL]; and see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#051">Mar 14:51-52</a>, as showing a tendency to this: but still more as part of that courage and majesty which so overawed them. He would not wait to be taken.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#005">John 18:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">joh 18:5</a></font></span></p>They answered . . . Jesus of Nazareth--just the sort of blunt, straight forward reply one expects from military men, simply acting on their instructions. 
 <p>
 </p><p>I am He--(See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#020">Joh 6:20</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Judas . . . stood with them--No more is recorded here of his part of the scene, but we have found the gap painfully supplied by all the other Evangelists.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#006">John 18:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">joh 18:6</a></font></span></p>As soon then as he said unto them, I am He, they went backward--recoiled. 
 <p>
 </p><p>and fell to the ground--struck down by a power such as that which smote Saul of Tarsus and his companions to the earth (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#014">Act 26:14</a>). It was the glorious effulgence of the majesty of Christ which overpowered them. "This, occurring before His surrender, would show His power over His enemies, and so the freedom with which He gave Himself up" [MEYER].
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#007">John 18:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">joh 18:7</a></font></span></p>Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye?--Giving them a door of escape from the guilt of a deed which now they were able in some measure to understand. 
 <p>
 </p><p>Jesus of Nazareth--The stunning effect of His first answer wearing off, they think only of the necessity of executing their orders.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#008">John 18:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">joh 18:8</a></font></span></p>I have told you that I am He: if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way--Wonderful self-possession, and consideration for others, in such circumstances!
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#009">John 18:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">joh 18:9</a></font></span></p>That the saying might be fulfilled which he spake, Of them which thou gavest me have I lost none--The reference is to such sayings as <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#039">Joh 6:39</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#012">Joh 17:12</a>; showing how conscious the Evangelist was, that in reporting his Lord's former sayings, he was giving them not in substance merely, but in form also. Observe, also, how the preservation of the disciples on this occasion is viewed as part that deeper preservation undoubtedly intended in the saying quoted.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#010">John 18:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">joh 18:10</a></font></span></p>Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus--None of the other Evangelists mention the name either of the ardent disciple or of his victim. John being "known to the high priest" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#015">Joh 18:15</a>), the mention of the servant's name by him is quite natural, and an interesting mark of truth in a small matter. As to the right ear, specified both here and in Luke (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#050">Luk 22:50</a>), the man was "likely foremost of those who advanced to seize Jesus, and presented himself in the attitude of a combatant; hence his right side would be exposed to attack. The blow of Peter was evidently aimed vertically at his head" [WEBSTER and WILKINSON].
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#011">John 18:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">joh 18:11</a></font></span></p>Then said Jesus--"Suffer ye thus far" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#051">Luk 22:51</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?--This expresses both the feelings which struggled in the Lord's breast during the Agony in the garden--aversion to the cup viewed in itself, but, in the light of the Father's will, perfect preparedness to drink it. (See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#039">Luk 22:39-46</a>). Matthew adds to the address to Peter the following:--"For all they that take the sword shall perish by the sword" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#052">Mat 26:52</a>) --that is, 'Those who take the sword must run all the risks of human warfare; but Mine is a warfare whose weapons, as they are not carnal, are attended with no such hazards, but carry certain victory.' "Thinkest thou that I cannot now"--even after things have proceeded so far--"pray to My Father, and He shall presently give Me"--rather, "place at My disposal"--"more than twelve legions of angels"; with allusion, possibly, to the one angel who had, in His agony, "appeared to Him from heaven strengthening Him" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#043">Luk 22:43</a>); and in the precise number, alluding to the twelve who needed the help, Himself and His eleven disciples. (The full complement of a legion of Roman soldiers was six thousand). "But how then shall the scripture be fulfilled that thus it must be?" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#053">Mat 26:53-54</a>). He could not suffer, according to the Scripture, if He allowed Himself to be delivered from the predicted death. "And He touched his ear and healed him" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#051">Luk 22:51</a>); for "the Son of man came not to destroy men's lives, but to save them" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#056">Luk 9:56</a>), and, even while they were destroying His, to save theirs.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#012">John 18:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">joh 18:12</a></font></span></p>Then the band . . . took Jesus--but not till He had made them feel that "no man took His life from Him, but that He laid it down of Himself."
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#013">John 18:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">joh 18:13</a></font></span></p>And led him away--"In that hour," says Matthew (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#055">Mat 26:55-56</a>), and probably now, on the way to judgment, when the crowds were pressing upon Him, "said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief, with swords and staves, for to take Me"--expressive of the indignity which He felt to be thus done to Him--"I sat daily with you in the temple, and ye laid no hold on Me. But this" (adds <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#053">Luk 22:53</a>) "is your hour and the power of darkness." Matthew continues--"But all this was done that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook Him and fled" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#056">Mat 26:56</a>) --thus fulfilling His prediction (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#027">Mar 14:27</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#032">Joh 16:32</a>).
 <p> JESUS BEFORE ANNAS AND CAIAPHAS--FALL OF PETER. (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#013">Joh 18:13-27</a>)
 </p><p>
 </p><p>And led him away to Annas first--(See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#002">Luk 3:2</a>, and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#057">Mat 26:57</a>). (Also see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#053">Mar 14:53</a>.)
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#014">John 18:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">joh 18:14</a></font></span></p>Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people--(Also see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#053">Mar 14:53</a>.)
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#015">John 18:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">joh 18:15</a></font></span></p>Simon Peter followed Jesus--Natural though this was, and safe enough, had he only "watched and prayed that he enter not into temptation," as his Master bade him (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#041">Mat 26:41</a>), it was, in his case, a fatal step. 
 <p>
 </p><p>and . . . another disciple--Rather, "the other disciple"--our Evangelist himself, no doubt. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>known unto the high priest--(See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#010">Joh 18:10</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#016">John 18:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">joh 18:16</a></font></span></p>But Peter stood at the door without--by preconcerted arrangement with his friend till he should get access for him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>Then went out that other . . . and spake to her that kept the door, and brought in Peter--The naturalness of these small details is not unworthy of notice. This other disciple first made good his own entrance on the score of acquaintance with the high priest; this secured, he goes forth again, now as a privileged person, to make interest for Peter's admission. But thus our poor disciple is in the coils of the serpent. The next steps will best be seen by inverting <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#017">Joh 18:17</a> and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#018">Joh 18:18</a>.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#017">John 18:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">joh 18:17</a></font></span></p>Then saith the damsel that kept the door--"one of the maids of the high priest," says Mark (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#066">Mar 14:66</a>). "When she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him and said" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#067">Mar 14:67</a>). Luke is more graphic (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#056">Luk 22:56</a>) --She "beheld him as he sat by the fire (literally, 'the light'), and earnestly looked on him (fixed her gaze upon him), and said." "His demeanor and timidity, which must have vividly showed themselves, as it so generally happens, leading to the recognition of him" [OLSHAUSEN]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>Art thou not also one of this man's disciples?--that is, thou as well as "that other disciple," whom she knew to be one, but did not challenge, perceiving that he was a privileged person. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>He saith, I am not--"He denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#070">Mat 26:70</a>) --a common form of point blank denial; "I know [supply 'Him'] not, neither understand I what thou sayest" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#068">Mar 14:68</a>); "Woman, I know Him not" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#057">Luk 22:57</a>). This was THE FIRST DENIAL. "And he went out into the porch [thinking, perhaps, to steal away], and the cock crew," (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#068">Mar 14:68</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#018">John 18:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">joh 18:18</a></font></span></p>And the servants and officers--the menials and some of the "band" that "took Jesus." (Also see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#054">Mar 14:54</a>.) 
 <p>
 </p><p>stood there, who had made--"having made." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>a fire of coals, for it was cold, and they warmed themselves--"John alone notices the material (charcoal) of which the fire was made, and the reason for a fire--the coldness of the night" [WEBSTER and WILKINSON]. "Peter went in and sat with the servants to see the end (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#058">Mat 26:58</a>), and warmed himself at the fire" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#054">Mar 14:54</a>). These two statements are extremely interesting. His wishing to "see the end," of issue of these proceedings, was what led him into the palace, for he evidently feared the worst. But once in, the serpent coil is drawn closer; it is a cold night, and why should not he take advantage of the fire as well as others? Besides, in the talk of the crowd about the all-engrossing topic, he may pick up something which he would like to hear. "And as Peter was beneath in the palace" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#066">Mar 14:66</a>). Matthew (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#069">Mat 26:69</a>) says, "sat without in the palace." According to Oriental architecture, and especially in large buildings, as here, the street door--or heavy folding gate through which single persons entered by a wicket kept by a porter--opened by a passage or "porch" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#068">Mar 14:68</a>) into a quadrangular court, here called the "palace" or hall, which was open above, and is frequently paved with flagstones. In the center of this court the "fire" would be kindled (in a brazier). At the upper end of it, probably, was the chamber in which the trial was held, open to the court and not far from the fire (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#061">Luk 22:61</a>), but on a higher level; for Mark (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#066">Mar 14:66</a>) says the court was "beneath" it. The ascent was, perhaps, by a short flight of steps. This explanation will make the intensely interesting details more intelligible.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">joh 18:19</a></font></span></p>The high priest . . . asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine--probably to entrap Him into some statements which might be used against Him at the trial. From our Lord's answer it would seem that "His disciples" were understood to be some secret party. (Also see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#054">Mar 14:54</a>.)

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">joh 18:24</a></font></span></p>Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas--Our translators so render the words, understanding that the foregoing interview took place before Caiaphas; Annas, declining to meddle with the case, having sent Him to Caiaphas at once. But the words here literally are, "Annas sent Him [not 'had sent Him'] to Caiaphas"--and the "now" being of doubtful authority. Thus read, the verse affords no evidence that He was sent to Caiaphas before the interview just recorded, but implies rather the contrary. We take this interview, then, with some of the ablest interpreters, to be a preliminary and non-official one with Annas, at an hour of the night when Caiaphas' Council could not convene; and one that ought not to be confounded with that solemn one recorded by the other Evangelists, when all were assembled and witnesses called. But the building in which both met with Jesus appears to have been the same, the room only being different, and the court, of course, in that case, one. (Also see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#054">Mar 14:54</a>.)

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">joh 18:25</a></font></span></p>And Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said therefore . . . Art thou not also one of his disciples?--In <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#071">Mat 26:71</a> the second charge was made by "another maid, when he was gone out into the porch," who "saw him, and said unto them that were there, This [fellow] was also with Jesus of Nazareth." So also <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#069">Mar 14:69</a>. But in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#058">Luk 22:58</a> it is said, "After a little while" (from the time of the first denial), "another [man] saw him, and said, Thou art also of them." Possibly it was thrown at him by more than one; but these circumstantial variations only confirm the truth of the narrative. 
 <p>
 </p><p>He denied it, and said, I am not--in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#072">Mat 26:72</a>, "He denied with an oath, I do not know the man." This was THE SECOND DENIAL.
 </p><p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">joh 18:26</a></font></span></p>One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman, whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him--No doubt his relationship to Malchus drew attention to the man who smote him, and this enabled him to identify Peter. "Sad reprisals!" [BENGEL]. The other Evangelists make his detection to turn upon his dialect. "After a while ['about the space of one hour after' (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#059">Luk 22:59</a>)] came unto him they that stood by and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them, for thy speech betrayeth thee" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#073">Mat 26:73</a>). "Thou art a Galilean, and thy speech agreeth thereto" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#070">Mar 14:70</a>; and so <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#059">Luk 22:59</a>). The Galilean dialect had a more Syrian cast than that of Judea. If Peter had held his peace, this peculiarity had not been observed; but hoping, probably, to put them off the scent by joining in the fireside talk, he only thus revealed himself.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#027">John 18:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">joh 18:27</a></font></span></p>Peter then denied again--But, if the challenge of Malchus' kinsman was made simultaneously with this on account of his Galilean dialect, it was no simple denial; for <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#074">Mat 26:74</a> says, "Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man." So <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#071">Mar 14:71</a>. This was THE THIRD DENIAL. 
 <p>
 </p><p>and immediately--"while he yet spake" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#060">Luk 22:60</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>the cock crew--As Mark is the only Evangelist who tells us that our Lord predicted that the cock should crow twice (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#030">Mar 14:30</a>), so he only mentions that it did crow twice (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#072">Mar 14:72</a>). The other Evangelists, who tell us merely that our Lord predicted that "before the cock should crow he would deny Him thrice" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#034">Mat 26:34</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#034">Luk 22:34</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#038">Joh 13:38</a>), mention only one actual crowing, which was Mark's last. This is something affecting in this Evangelist--who, according to the earliest tradition (confirmed by internal evidence), derived his materials so largely from Peter as to have been styled his "interpreter," being the only one who gives both the sad prediction and its still sadder fulfilment in full. It seems to show that Peter himself not only retained through all his after-life the most vivid recollection of the circumstances of his fall, but that he was willing that others should know them too. The immediately subsequent acts are given in full only in Luke (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#061">Luk 22:61-62</a>): "And the Lord turned and looked upon Peter," from the hall of judgment to the court, in the way already explained. But who can tell what lightning flashes of wounded love and piercing reproach shot from that "look" through the eye of Peter into his heart! "And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny Me thrice. And Peter went out and wept bitterly." How different from the sequel of Judas' act! Doubtless the hearts of the two men towards the Saviour were perfectly different from the first; and the treason of Judas was but the consummation of the wretched man's resistance of the blaze of light in the midst of which he had lived for three years, while Peter's denial was but a momentary obscuration of the heavenly light and love to his Master which ruled his life. But the immediate cause of the revulsion, which made Peter "weep bitterly," was, beyond all doubt, this heart-piercing "look" which his Lord gave him. And remembering the Saviour's own words at the table, "Simon, Simon, Satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat, but I have prayed [rather, 'I prayed'] for thee that thy faith fail not" (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#031">Luk 22:31-32</a>), may we not say that this prayer fetched down all that there was in that 'look' to pierce and break the heart of. Peter, to keep it from despair, to work in it "repentance unto salvation not to be repented of," and at length, under other healing touches, to "restore his soul?" (See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#007">Mar 16:7</a>).

 <p>
 </p><p>Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas to the hall of judgment--but not till "in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council against Him to put Him to death, and bound Him" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#001">Mat 27:1</a>; and see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#001">Mar 15:1</a>). The word here rendered "hall of judgment" is from the Latin, and denotes "the palace of the governor of a Roman province." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>they themselves went not into the judgment hall lest they should be defiled--by contact with ceremonially unclean Gentiles. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>but that they might eat the passover--If this refer to the principal part of the festival, the eating of the lamb, the question is, how our Lord and His disciples came to eat it the night before; and, as it was an evening meal, how ceremonial defilement contracted in the morning would unfit them for partaking of it, as after six o'clock it was reckoned a new day. These are questions which have occasioned immense research and learned treatises. But as the usages of the Jews appear to have somewhat varied at different times, and our present knowledge of them is not sufficient to clear up all difficulties, they are among the not very important questions which probably will never be entirely solved.

(The Jewish mode in such cases as this was by stoning).

Art thou the King of the Jews?--In <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#002">Luk 23:2</a> they charge our Lord before Pilate with "perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to CÃ&amp;brvbr;sar, saying that He Himself is Christ a king." Perhaps this was what occasioned Pilate's question.

Sayest thou this of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?--an important question for our Lord's case, to bring out whether the word "King" were meant in a political sense, with which Pilate had a right to deal, or whether he were merely put up to it by His accusers, who had no claims to charge Him but such as were of a purely religious nature, with which Pilate had nothing to do.
 <p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_035">joh 18:35</a></font></span></p>Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests delivered thee to me: What hast thou done?--that is, "Jewish questions I neither understand nor meddle with; but Thou art here on a charge which, though it seems only Jewish, may yet involve treasonable matter: As they state it, I cannot decide the point; tell me, then, what procedure of Thine has brought Thee into this position." In modern phrase, Pilate's object in this question was merely to determine the relevancy of the charge.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#036">John 18:36</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_036">joh 18:36</a></font></span></p>Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world--He does not say "not over," but "not of this world"--that is, in its origin and nature; therefore "no such kingdom as need give thee or thy master the least alarm." 
 <p>
 </p><p>if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews--"A very convincing argument; for if His servants did not fight to prevent their King from being delivered up to His enemies, much less would they use force for the establishment of His kingdom" [WEBSTER and WILKINSON]. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>but now--but the fact is. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>is my kingdom not from hence--Our Lord only says whence His kingdom is not--first simply affirming it, next giving proof of it, then reaffirming it. This was all that Pilate had to do with. The positive nature of His kingdom He would not obtrude upon one who was as little able to comprehend it, as entitled officially to information about it. (It is worthy of notice that the "MY," which occurs four times in this one verse--thrice of His kingdom, and once of His servants--is put in the emphatic form).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#037">John 18:37</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_037">joh 18:37</a></font></span></p>Art thou a king then?--There was no sarcasm or disdain in this question (as THOLUCK, ALFORD, and others, allege), else our Lord's answer would have been different. Putting emphasis upon "thou," his question betrays a mixture of surprise and uneasiness, partly at the possibility of there being, after all, something dangerous under the claim, and partly from a certain awe which our Lord's demeanor probably struck into him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>Thou sayest that I am a king--It is even so. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>To this end was I--"have I been." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>born and for this cause came I--am I come. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>into the world, that I may bear witness to the truth--His birth expresses His manhood; His coming into the world, His existence before assuming humanity: The truth, then, here affirmed, though Pilate would catch little of it, was that His Incarnation was expressly in order to the assumption of Royalty in our nature. Yet, instead of saying, He came to be a King, which is His meaning, He says He came to testify to the truth. Why this? Because, in such circumstances it required a noble courage not to flinch from His royal claims; and our Lord, conscious that He was putting forth that courage, gives a turn to His confession expressive of it. It is to this that Paul alludes, in those remarkable words to Timothy: "I charge thee before God, who quickeneth all things, and before Christ Jesus, who, in the presence of Pontius Pilate, witnessed the good confession" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#013">Ti1 6:13</a>). This one act of our Lord's life, His courageous witness-bearing before the governor, was selected as an encouraging example of the fidelity which Timothy ought to display. As the Lord (says OLSHAUSEN beautifully) owned Himself the Son of God before the most exalted theocratic council, so He confessed His regal dignity in presence of the representative of the highest political authority on earth. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice--Our Lord here not only affirms that His word had in it a self-evidencing, self-recommending power, but gently insinuated the true secret of the growth and grandeur of His kingdom--as A KINGDOM OF TRUTH, in its highest sense, into which all souls who have learned to live and count all things but loss for the truth are, by a most heavenly attraction, drawn as into their proper element; THE KING of whom Jesus is, fetching them in and ruling them by His captivating power over their hearts.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#038">John 18:38</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_038">joh 18:38</a></font></span></p>Pilate saith unto him, What is truth?--that is, "Thou stirrest the question of questions, which the thoughtful of every age have asked, but never man yet answered." 
 <p>
 </p><p>And when he had said this--as if, by putting such a question, he was getting into interminable and unseasonable inquiries, when this business demanded rather prompt action. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>he went out again unto the Jews--thus missing a noble opportunity for himself, and giving utterance to that consciousness of the want of all intellectual and moral certainty, which was the feeling of every thoughtful mind at that time. "The only certainty," says the elder PLINY, "is that nothing is certain, nor more miserable than man, nor more proud. The fearful laxity of morals at that time must doubtless be traced in a great degree to this skepticism. The revelation of the eternal truth alone was able to breathe new life into ruined human nature, and that in the apprehension of complete redemption" [OLSHAUSEN]. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and saith unto them--in the hearing of our Lord, who had been brought forth. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>I find in him no fault--no crime. This so exasperated "the chief priests and elders" that, afraid of losing their prey, they poured forth a volley of charges against Him, as appears from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#004">Luk 23:4-5</a> : on Pilate's affirming His innocence, "they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place." They see no hope of getting Pilate's sanction to His death unless they can fasten upon Him a charge of conspiracy against the government; and as Galilee was noted for its turbulence (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#001">Luk 13:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#037">Act 5:37</a>), and our Lord's ministry lay chiefly there, they artfully introduce it to give color to their charge. "And the chief priests accused Him of many things, but He answered nothing (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#003">Mar 15:3</a>). Then said Pilate unto Him, Hearest Thou not how many things they witness against Thee? And He answered him to never a word, insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#013">Mat 27:13-14</a>). See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#003">Mar 15:3-5</a>. In his perplexity, Pilate, hearing of Galilee, bethinks himself of the expedient of sending Him to Herod, in the hope of thereby further shaking off responsibility in the case. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#006">Mar 15:6</a>, and see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#006">Luk 23:6-12</a>. The return of the prisoner only deepened the perplexity of Pilate, who, "calling together the chief priests, rulers, and people," tells them plainly that not one of their charges against "this man" had been made good, while even Herod, to whose jurisdiction he more naturally belonged, had done nothing to Him: He "will therefore chastise and release him" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#013">Luk 23:13-16</a>).
