 <p>
 </p><p>while Apollos was at Corinth--where his ministry was so powerful that a formidable party in the Church of that city gloried in his type of preaching in preference to Paul's (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#012">Co1 1:12</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#004">Co1 3:4</a>), no doubt from the marked infusion of Greek philosophic culture which distinguished it, and which the apostle studiously avoided (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#001">Co1 2:1-5</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Paul having passed through the upper coasts--"parts," the interior of Asia Minor, which, with reference to the seacoast, was elevated. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>came to Ephesus--thus fulfilling his promise (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#021">Act 18:21</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>finding certain disciples--in the same stage of Christian knowledge as Apollos at first, newly arrived, probably, and having had no communication as yet with the church at Ephesus.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#002">Acts 19:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">act 19:2</a></font></span></p>Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed?--rather, "Received ye the Holy Ghost when ye believed?" implying, certainly, that the one did not of necessity carry the other along with it (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#014">Act 8:14-17</a>). Why this question was asked, we cannot tell; but it was probably in consequence of something that passed between them from which the apostle was led to suspect the imperfection of their light. 
 <p>
 </p><p>We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost--This cannot be the meaning, since the personality and office of the Holy Ghost, in connection with Christ, formed an especial subject of the Baptist's teaching. Literally, the words are, "We did not even hear whether the Holy Ghost was (given)"; meaning, at the time of their baptism. That the word "given" is the right supplement, as in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#039">Joh 7:39</a>, seems plain from the nature of the case.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#004">Acts 19:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">act 19:4</a></font></span></p>Then said Paul, John . . . baptized with the baptism of repentance--water unto repentance. 
 <p>
 </p><p>saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him--that is, who should baptize with the Holy Ghost. The point of contrast is not between John and Christ personally, but between the water baptism of John unto repentance, and the promised baptism of the Spirit from the hands of his coming Master unto new life. As to all the facts, or at least the significancy, of this baptism, which made the whole life and work of Christ another thing from what it was conceived to be before it was vouchsafed, these simple disciples were unenlightened.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#005">Acts 19:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">act 19:5</a></font></span></p>When they heard this--not the mere words reported in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#004">Act 19:4</a>, but the subject expounded according to the tenor of those words. 
 <p>
 </p><p>they were baptized--not however by Paul himself (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#014">Co1 1:14</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>in the name of the Lord Jesus--into the whole fulness of the new economy, as now opened up to their believing minds.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#006">Acts 19:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">act 19:6</a></font></span></p>And when Paul had laid his hands upon them . . . they spake with tongues, &amp;c.--See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#044">Act 10:44-45</a>.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">act 19:8</a></font></span></p>he went into the synagogue and spake boldly for . . . three months, &amp;c.--See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#002">Act 17:2-3</a>.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#009">Acts 19:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">act 19:9</a></font></span></p>when divers--"some." 
 <p>
 </p><p>were hardened, &amp;c.--implying that others, probably a large number, believed. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed--from the synagogue, as at Corinth (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#007">Act 18:7</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and separated the disciples--withdrawing to a separate place of meeting, for the sake both of the converts already made, and the unsophisticated multitude. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>disputing--"discoursing" or "discussing." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>daily in the school--or lecture hall. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>of one Tyrannus--probably a converted teacher of rhetoric or philosophy.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#010">Acts 19:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">act 19:10</a></font></span></p>this continued . . . two years--in addition to the former three months. See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#031">Act 20:31</a>. But during some part of this period he must have paid a second unrecorded visit to Corinth, since the one next recorded (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#002">Act 20:2-3</a>) is twice called his third visit (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#014">Co2 12:14</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#001">Co2 13:1</a>). See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#015">Co2 1:15-16</a>, which might seem inconsistent with this. The passage across was quite a short one (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#019">Act 18:19</a>) --Towards the close of this long stay at Ephesus, as we learn from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#008">Co1 16:8</a>, he wrote his FIRST EPISTLE TO THE CORINTHIANS; also (though on this opinions are divided) the EPISTLE TO THE GALATIANS. (See Introduction to First Corinthians, and Introduction to Galatians). And just as at Corinth his greatest success was after his withdrawal to a separate place of meeting (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#007">Act 18:7-10</a>), so at Ephesus. 
 <p>
 </p><p>so that all they which dwelt in--the Roman province of 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks--This is the "great door and effectual opened unto him" while resident at Ephesus (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#009">Co1 16:9</a>), which induced him to make it his headquarters for so long a period. The unwearied and varied character of his labors here are best seen in his own subsequent address to the elders of Ephesus (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#017">Act 20:17</a>, &amp;c.). And thus Ephesus became the "ecclesiastical center for the entire region, as indeed it remained for a very long period" [BAUMGARTEN]. Churches arose at Colosse, Laodicea, and Hierapolis eastward, either through his own labors or those of his faithful helpers whom he sent out in different directions, Epaphras, Archippus, Philemon (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#007">Col 1:7</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#012">Col 4:12-17</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#023">Plm 1:23</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">act 19:12</a></font></span></p>So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, &amp;c.--Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#015">Act 5:15-16</a>, very different from the magical acts practiced at Ephesus. "God wrought these miracles" merely "by the hands of Paul"; and the very exorcists (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#013">Act 19:13</a>), observing that the name of Jesus was the secret of all his miracles, hoped, by aping him in this, to be equally successful; while the result of all in the "magnifying of the Lord Jesus" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#017">Act 19:17</a>) showed that in working them the apostle took care to hold up Him whom he preached as the source of all the miracles which he wrought.
 <p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">act 19:13</a></font></span></p>vagabond Jews--simply, "wandering Jews," who went from place to place practicing exorcism, or the art of conjuring evil spirits to depart out of the possessed. That such a power did exist, for some time at least, seems implied in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#027">Mat 12:27</a>. But no doubt this would breed imposture; and the present case is very different from that referred to in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#049">Luk 9:49-50</a>. 
 <p>
 </p><p>We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth--a striking testimony to the power of Christ's name in Paul's mouth.

The reality of such possessions could not be more clearly expressed. 
 <p>
 </p><p>leaped on them . . . so that they fled . . . naked and wounded--This was so appalling a testimony at once against those profane impostors and in favor of Paul and the Master whom he preached, that we wonder not that it spread to "all the Jews and Greeks at Ephesus, that fear fell on them," and that "the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified."
 </p><p>

 </p><p>and burned them before all--The tense, here used graphically, expresses progress and continuance of the conflagration. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>counted the price . . . and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver--about Â£2000 (presuming it to be the drachma, the current coin of the Levant, of about 10d. value). From their nature they would be costly, and books then bore a value above any standard we are familiar with. The scene must have been long remembered at Ephesus, as a strong proof of honest conviction on the part of the sorcerers and a striking triumph of Jesus Christ over the powers of darkness. The workers of evil were put to scorn, like Baal's priests on Carmel, and the word of God mightily grew and prevailed [HOWSON].
 </p><p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">act 19:21</a></font></span></p>After these things were ended--completed, implying something like a natural finish to his long period of labor at Ephesus. 
 <p>
 </p><p>Paul purposed . . . when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem . . . After I have been there, I must also see Rome--Mark here the vastness of the apostle's missionary plans. They were all fulfilled, though he "saw Rome" only as a prisoner.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#022">Acts 19:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">act 19:22</a></font></span></p>So he sent into Macedonia . . . Timotheus and Erastus--as his pioneers, in part to bring "them into remembrance of his ways which were in Christ" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#017">Co1 4:17</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#010">Co1 16:10</a>), partly to convey his mind on various matters. After a brief stay he was to return (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#011">Co1 16:11</a>). It is very unlikely that this Erastus was "the chamberlain of the city" of Corinth, of that name (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#023">Rom 16:23</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>he himself stayed in--the province of 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Asia for a season--that is, at Ephesus, its chief city. (Asia is mentioned in contrast with Macedonia in the previous clause).

 <p>
 </p><p>Diana--small models of the Ephesian temple and of the shrine or chapel of the goddess, or of the shrine and statue alone, which were purchased by visitors as memorials of what they had seen, and were carried about and deposited in houses as a charm. (The models of the chapel of our Lady of Loretto, and such like, which the Church of Rome systematically encourages, are such a palpable imitation of this heathen practice that it is no wonder it should be regarded by impartial judges as Christianity paganized). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>gain to the craftsmen--the master-artificers.

 <p>
 </p><p>that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath . . . turned away much people--Noble testimony this to the extent of Paul's influence! 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>saying that they be no gods which are made with hands--The universal belief of the people was that they were gods, though the more intelligent regarded them only as habitations of Deity, and some, probably, as mere aids to devotion. It is exactly so in the Church of Rome.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#027">Acts 19:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">act 19:27</a></font></span></p>So that not only this our craft is in danger . . . but, &amp;c.--that is, "that indeed is a small matter; but there is something far worse." So the masters of the poor Pythoness put forward the religious revolution which Paul was attempting to effect at Philippi, as the sole cause of their zealous alarm, to cloak the self-interest which they felt to be touched by his success (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#019">Act 16:19-21</a>). In both cases religious zeal was the hypocritical pretext; self-interest, the real moving cause of the opposition made. 
 <p>
 </p><p>also the temple of the great goddess Diana . . . despised, and her magnificence . . . destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth--It was reckoned one of the wonders of the world. It was built about 550 B.C., of pure white marble, and though burned by a fanatic on the night of the birth of Alexander the Great, 356 B.C., was rebuilt with more splendor than before. It was four hundred twenty-five feet long by two hundred twenty broad, and the columns, one hundred twenty-seven in number, were sixty feet in height, each of them the gift of a king, and thirty-six of them enriched with ornament and color. It was constantly receiving new decorations and additional buildings, statues, and pictures by the most celebrated artists, and kindled unparalleled admiration, enthusiasm, and superstition. Its very site is now a matter of uncertainty. The little wooden image of Diana was as primitive and rude as its shrine was sumptuous; not like the Greek Diana, in the form of an imposing huntress, but quite Asiatic, in the form of a many-breasted female (emblematic of the manifold ministrations of Nature to man), terminating in a shapeless block. Like some other far-famed idols, it was believed to have fallen from heaven (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#035">Act 19:35</a>), and models of it were not only sold in immense numbers to private persons, but set up for worship in other cities [HOWSON]. What power must have attended the preaching of that one man by whom the death blow was felt to be given to their gigantic and witching superstition!

These were wealthy and distinguished citizens of the principal towns of the Asian province, chosen annually, and ten of whom were selected by the proconsul to preside over the games celebrated in the month of May (the same month which Romanism dedicates to the Virgin). It was an office of the highest honor and greatly coveted. Certain of these, it seems, were favorably inclined to the Gospel, at least were Paul's "friends," and knowing the passions of a mob, excited during the festivals, "sent (a message) to him desiring him not to adventure himself into the theater."

As the blame of such a tumult would naturally be thrown upon the Jews, who were regarded by the Romans as the authors of all religious disturbances, they seem to have put forward this man to clear them of all responsibility for the riot. (BENGEL'S conjecture, that this was Alexander the coppersmith, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#014">Ti2 4:14</a>, has little to support it).

To prevent him obtaining a hearing, they drowned his voice in one tumultuous shout in honor of their goddess, which rose to such frantic enthusiasm as took two hours to exhaust itself.

 <p>
 </p><p>had appeased--"calmed." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>the people--"the multitude," which the very presence of such an officer would go far to do. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>he said . . . what man . . . knoweth not that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana--literally, the neocoros or "warden." The word means "temple-sweeper"; then, "temple-guardian." Thirteen cities of Asia had an interest in the temple, but Ephesus was honored with the charge of it. (Various cities have claimed this title with reference to the Virgin or certain saints) [WEBSTER and WILKINSON]. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and of the image which fell down from Jupiter--"from the sky" or "from heaven." See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#027">Act 19:27</a>. "With this we may compare various legends concerning images and pictures in the Romish Church, such as the traditional likenesses of Christ, which were said to be "not made with hands"" [WEBSTER and WILKINSON].

Did they suppose that all this was going to be overturned by a set of itinerant orators? Ridiculous! What did they mean, then, by raising such a stir?

 <p>
 </p><p>nor yet blasphemers of your goddess--This is a remarkable testimony, showing that the apostle had, in preaching against idolatry, studiously avoided (as at Athens) insulting the feelings of those whom he addressed--a lesson this to missionaries and ministers in general.

 <p>
 </p><p>against any man, the law is open--rather, "the court days are being held." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and there are deputies--literally "proconsuls" (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#007">Act 13:7</a>); that is, probably, the proconsul and his council, as a court of appeal.
