 <p>
 </p><p>when any will offer a meat offering--or gift--distinguishing a bloodless from a bloody sacrifice. The word "meat," however, is improper, as its meaning as now used is different from that attached at the date of our English translation. It was then applied not to "flesh," but "food," generally, and here it is applied to the flour of wheat. The meat offerings were intended as a thankful acknowledgment for the bounty of Providence; and hence, although meat offerings accompanied some of the appointed sacrifices, those here described being voluntary oblations, were offered alone. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>pour oil upon it--Oil was used as butter is with us; symbolically it meant the influences of the Spirit, of which oil was the emblem, as incense was of prayer.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">lev 2:2</a></font></span></p>shall burn the memorial--rather, "for a memorial"; that is, a part of it.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#003">Leviticus 2:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">lev 2:3</a></font></span></p>the remnant of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his sons'--The circumstance of a portion of it being appropriated to the use of the priests distinguishes this from a burnt offering. They alone were to partake of it within the sacred precincts, as among "the most holy things."

 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#004">Leviticus 2:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">lev 2:4</a></font></span></p>if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the oven--generally a circular hole excavated in the floor, from one to five feet deep, the sides of which are covered with hardened plaster, on which cakes are baked of the form and thickness of pancakes. (See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#006">Gen 18:6</a>). The shape of Eastern ovens varies considerably according to the nomadic or settled habits of the people.

 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#005">Leviticus 2:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">lev 2:5</a></font></span></p>baken in a pan--a thin plate, generally of copper or iron, placed on a slow fire, similar to what the country people in Scotland called a "girdle" for baking oatmeal cakes.

 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#006">Leviticus 2:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">lev 2:6</a></font></span></p>part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon--Pouring oil on bread is a common practice among Eastern people, who are fond of broken bread dipped in oil, butter, and milk. Oil only was used in the meat offerings, and probably for a symbolic reason. It is evident that these meat offerings were previously prepared by the offerer, and when brought, the priest was to take it from his hands and burn a portion on the altar.

 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#011">Leviticus 2:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">lev 2:11</a></font></span></p>ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any offering of the Lord--Nothing sweet or sour was to be offered. In the warm climates of the East leavened bread soon spoils, and hence it was regarded as the emblem of hypocrisy or corruption. Some, however, think that the prohibition was that leaven and honey were used in the idolatrous rites of the heathen.

 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#012">Leviticus 2:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">lev 2:12</a></font></span></p>the oblation of the first-fruits--voluntary offerings made by individuals out of their increase, and leaven and honey might be used with these (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#017">Lev 23:17</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#020">Num 15:20</a>). Though presented at the altar, they were not consumed, but assigned by God for the use of the priests.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#013">Leviticus 2:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">lev 2:13</a></font></span></p>every . . . meat offering shalt thou season with salt--The same reasons which led to the prohibition of leaven, recommended the use of salt--if the one soon putrefies, the other possesses a strongly preservative property, and hence it became an emblem of incorruption and purity, as well as of a perpetual covenant--a perfect reconciliation and lasting friendship. No injunction in the whole law was more sacredly observed than this application of salt; for besides other uses of it that will be noticed elsewhere, it had a typical meaning referred to by our Lord concerning the effect of the Gospel on those who embrace it (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#049">Mar 9:49-50</a>); as when plentifully applied it preserves meat from spoiling, so will the Gospel keep men from being corrupted by sin. And as salt was indispensable to render sacrifices acceptable to God, so the Gospel, brought home to the hearts of men by the Holy Ghost, is indispensably requisite to their offering up of themselves as living sacrifices [BROWN].

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">lev 2:14</a></font></span></p>a meat offering of thy first-fruits--From the mention of "green ears," this seems to have been a voluntary offering before the harvest--the ears being prepared in the favorite way of Eastern people, by parching them at the fire, and then beating them out for use. It was designed to be an early tribute of pious thankfulness for the earth's increase, and it was offered according to the usual directions.
