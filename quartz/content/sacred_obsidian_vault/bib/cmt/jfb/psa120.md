Fausset and David Brown [1882] at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#001">Psalms Chapter 120</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#002">Psalms 120:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">psa 120:2</a></font></span></p>This is the first of fifteen Psalms (Psalms 120-134) entitled "A Song of Degrees" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#001">Psa 121:1</a> --literally, "A song for the degrees"), or ascents. It seems most probable they were designed for the use of the people when going up (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#027">Kg1 12:27-28</a>) to Jerusalem on the festival occasions (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#016">Deu 16:16</a>), three times a year. David appears as the author of four, Solomon of one (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#001">Psa 127:1</a>), and the other ten are anonymous, probably composed after the captivity. In this Psalm the writer acknowledges God's mercy, prays for relief from a malicious foe, whose punishment he anticipates, and then repeats his complaint. (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#001">Psa 120:1-7</a>)

 </p><p>coals of juniper--which retain heat long. This verse may be read as a description of the wicked, but better as their punishment, in reply to the question of <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#003">Psa 120:3</a>.

 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#005">Psalms 120:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">psa 120:5</a></font></span></p>A residence in these remote lands pictures his miserable condition.

 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#006">Psalms 120:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">psa 120:6</a></font></span></p>While those who surrounded him were maliciously hostile, he was disposed to peace. This Psalm may well begin such a series as this, as a contrast to the promised joys of God's worship.
