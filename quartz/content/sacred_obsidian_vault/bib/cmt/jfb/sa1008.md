 <p>
 </p><p>when Samuel was old--He was now about fifty-four years of age, having discharged the office of sole judge for twelve years. Unable, from growing infirmities, to prosecute his circuit journeys through the country, he at length confined his magisterial duties to Ramah and its neighborhood (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#015">Sa1 7:15</a>), delegating to his sons as his deputies the administration of justice in the southern districts of Palestine, their provincial court being held at Beer-sheba. The young men, however, did not inherit the high qualities of their father. Having corrupted the fountains of justice for their own private aggrandizement, a deputation of the leading men in the country lodged a complaint against them in headquarters, accompanied with a formal demand for a change in the government. The limited and occasional authority of the judges, the disunion and jealousy of the tribes under the administration of those rulers, had been creating a desire for a united and permanent form of government; while the advanced age of Samuel, together with the risk of his death happening in the then unsettled state of the people, was the occasion of calling forth an expression of this desire now.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">sa1 8:6</a></font></span></p>the thing displeased Samuel when they said, Give us a king to judge us--Personal and family feelings might affect his views of this public movement. But his dissatisfaction arose principally from the proposed change being revolutionary in its character. Though it would not entirely subvert their theocratic government, the appointment of a visible monarch would necessarily tend to throw out of view their unseen King and Head. God intimated, through Samuel, that their request would, in anger, be granted, while at the same time he apprised them of some of the evils that would result from their choice.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">sa1 8:11</a></font></span></p>This will be the manner of the king--The following is a very just and graphic picture of the despotic governments which anciently and still are found in the East, and into conformity with which the Hebrew monarchy, notwithstanding the restrictions prescribed by the law, gradually slid. 
 <p>
 </p><p>He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself--Oriental sovereigns claim a right to the services of any of their subjects at pleasure. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>some shall run before his chariots--The royal equipages were, generally throughout the East (as in Persia they still are), preceded and accompanied by a number of attendants who ran on foot.

 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#012">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 8:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">sa1 8:12</a></font></span></p>he will appoint him captains--In the East, a person must accept any office to which he may be nominated by the king, however irksome it may be to his taste or ruinous to his interests.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#013">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 8:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">sa1 8:13</a></font></span></p>he will take your daughters to be confectionaries--Cookery, baking, and the kindred works are, in Eastern countries, female employment, and thousands of young women are occupied with these offices in the palaces even of petty princes.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#014">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 8:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">sa1 8:14</a></font></span></p>he will take your fields, &amp;c.--The circumstances mentioned here might be illustrated by exact analogies in the conduct of many Oriental monarchs in the present day.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">sa1 8:19</a></font></span></p>Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel--They sneered at Samuel's description as a bugbear to frighten them. Determined, at all hazards, to gain their object, they insisted on being made like all the other nations, though it was their glory and happiness to be unlike other nations in having the Lord for their King and Lawgiver (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#009">Num 23:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#028">Deu 33:28</a>). Their demand was conceded, for the government of a king had been provided for in the law; and they were dismissed to wait the appointment, which God had reserved to Himself (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#014">Deu 17:14-20</a>).
