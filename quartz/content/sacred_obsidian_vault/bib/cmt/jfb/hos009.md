 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">hos 9:1</a></font></span></p>WARNING AGAINST ISRAEL'S JOY AT PARTIAL RELIEF FROM THEIR TROUBLES: THEIR CROPS SHALL FAIL, AND THE PEOPLE LEAVE THE LORD'S LAND FOR EGYPT AND ASSYRIA, WHERE THEY CANNOT, IF SO INCLINED, SERVE GOD ACCORDING TO THE ANCIENT RITUAL: FOLLY OF THEIR FALSE PROPHETS. (Hos. 9:1-17)
 <p>
 </p><p>Rejoice not . . . for joy--literally, "to exultation." Thy exultation at the league with Pul, by which peace seems secured, is out of place: since thy idolatry will bring ruin on thee. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>as other people--the Assyrians for instance, who, unlike thee, are in the height of prosperity. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>loved a reward upon every corn floor--Thou hast desired, in reward for thy homage to idols, abundance of corn on every threshing-floor (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#012">Hos 2:12</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#002">Hosea 9:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">hos 9:2</a></font></span></p>(<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#009">Hos 2:9</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#012">Hos 2:12</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>fail--disappoint her expectation.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#003">Hosea 9:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">hos 9:3</a></font></span></p>return to Egypt--(See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#013">Hos 8:13</a>). As in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#005">Hos 11:5</a> it is said, "He shall not return into . . . Egypt." FAIRBAIRN thinks it is not the exact country that is meant, but the bondage state with which, from past experience, Egypt was identified in their minds. Assyria was to be a second Egypt to them. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#068">Deu 28:68</a>, though threatening a return to Egypt, speaks (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#036">Deu 28:36</a>) of their being brought to a nation which neither they nor their fathers had known, showing that it is not the literal Egypt, but a second Egypt-like bondage that is threatened. 
 <p>
 </p><p>eat unclean things in Assyria--reduced by necessity to eat meats pronounced unclean by the Mosaic law (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#013">Eze 4:13</a>). See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#006">Kg2 17:6</a>.

 <p>
 </p><p>neither shall they be pleasing unto him--as being offered on a profane soil. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>sacrifices . . . as the bread of mourners--which was unclean (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#014">Deu 26:14</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#007">Jer 16:7</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#017">Eze 24:17</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>their bread for their soul--their offering for the expiation of their soul [CALVIN], (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#011">Lev 17:11</a>). Rather, "their bread for their sustenance ('soul' being often used for the animal life, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#021">Gen 14:21</a>, Margin) shall not come into the Lord's house"; it shall only subserve their own uses, not My worship.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">hos 9:6</a></font></span></p>because of destruction--to escape from the devastation of their country. 
 <p>
 </p><p>Egypt shall gather them up--that is, into its sepulchres (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#002">Jer 8:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#005">Eze 29:5</a>). Instead of returning to Palestine, they should die in Egypt. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Memphis--famed as a necropolis. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>the pleasant places for their silver--that is, their desired treasuries for their money. Or, "whatever precious thing they have of silver" [MAURER]. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>nettles--the sign of desolation (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#013">Isa 34:13</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#007">Hosea 9:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">hos 9:7</a></font></span></p>visitation--vengeance: punishment (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#003">Isa 10:3</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>Israel shall know it--to her cost experimentally (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#009">Isa 9:9</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>the prophet is a fool--The false prophet who foretold prosperity to the nation shall be convicted of folly by the event. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>the spiritual man--the man pretending to inspiration (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#014">Lam 2:14</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#003">Eze 13:3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#011">Mic 3:11</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#004">Zep 3:4</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>for the multitude of thine iniquity, &amp;c.--Connect these words with, "the days of visitation . . . are come"; "the prophet . . . is mad," being parenthetical. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>the great hatred--or, "the great provocation" [HENDERSON]; or, "(thy) great apostasy" [MAURER]. English Version means Israel's "hatred" of God's prophets and the law.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#008">Hosea 9:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">hos 9:8</a></font></span></p>The watchman . . . was with my God--The spiritual watchmen, the true prophets, formerly consulted my God (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#006">Jer 31:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#001">Hab 2:1</a>); but their so-called prophet is a snare, entrapping Israel into idolatry. 
 <p>
 </p><p>hatred--rather, "(a cause of) apostasy" (see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#007">Hos 9:7</a>) [MAURER]. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>house of his God--that is, the state of Ephraim, as in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#001">Hos 8:1</a> [MAURER]. Or, "the house of his (false) god," the calves [CALVIN]. Jehovah, "my God," seems contrasted with "his God." CALVIN'S view is therefore preferable.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#009">Hosea 9:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">hos 9:9</a></font></span></p>as in the days of Gibeah--as in the day of the perpetration of the atrocity of Gibeah, narrated in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#016">Jdg 19:16-22</a>, &amp;c.
 <p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">hos 9:10</a></font></span></p>As the traveller in a wilderness is delighted at finding grapes to quench his thirst, or the early fig (esteemed a great delicacy in the East, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#004">Isa 28:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#002">Jer 24:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#001">Mic 7:1</a>); so it was My delight to choose your fathers as My peculiar people in Egypt (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#015">Hos 2:15</a>).

 </p><p>at her first time--when the first-fruits of the tree become ripe. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>went to Baal-peor-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#003">Num 25:3</a>): the Moabite idol, in whose worship young women prostituted themselves; the very sin Israel latterly was guilty of. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>separated themselves--consecrated themselves. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>unto that shame--to that shameful or foul idol (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#013">Jer 11:13</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>their abominations were according as they loved--rather, as Vulgate, "they became abominable like the object of their love" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#026">Deu 7:26</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#008">Psa 115:8</a>). English Version gives good sense, "their abominable idols they followed after, according as their lusts prompted them" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#005">Amo 4:5</a>, Margin).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#011">Hosea 9:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">hos 9:11</a></font></span></p>their glory shall fly away--fit retribution to those who "separated themselves unto that shame" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#010">Hos 9:10</a>). Children were accounted the glory of parents; sterility, a reproach. "Ephraim" means "fruitfulness" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#052">Gen 41:52</a>); this its name shall cease to be its characteristic. 
 <p>
 </p><p>from the birth . . . womb . . . conception--Ephraim's children shall perish in a threefold gradation; (1) From the time of birth. (2) From the time of pregnancy. (3) From the time of their first conception.

 <p>
 </p><p>woe . . . to them when I depart--Yet the ungodly in their madness desire God to depart from them (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#014">Job 21:14</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#017">Job 22:17</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#034">Mat 8:34</a>). At last they know to their cost how awful it is when God has departed (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#017">Deu 31:17</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#015">Sa1 28:15-16</a>; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#011">Hos 9:11</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#021">Sa1 4:21</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">hos 9:14</a></font></span></p>what wilt thou give?--As if overwhelmed by feeling, he deliberates with God what is most desirable. 
 <p>
 </p><p>give . . . a miscarrying womb--Of two evils he chooses the least. So great will be the calamity, that barrenness will be a blessing, though usually counted a great misfortune (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#003">Job 3:3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#014">Jer 20:14</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#029">Luk 23:29</a>).

 </p><p>
 </p><p>there I hated them--not with the human passion, but holy hatred of their sin, which required punishment to be inflicted on themselves (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#003">Mal 1:3</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>out of mine house--as in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#001">Hos 8:1</a> : out of the land holy unto ME. Or, as "love" is mentioned immediately after, the reference may be to the Hebrew mode of divorce, the husband (God) putting the wife (Israel) out of the house.
