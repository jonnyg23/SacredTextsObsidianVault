Fausset and David Brown [1882] at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#001">Isaiah Chapter 15</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#001">Isaiah 15:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">isa 15:1</a></font></span></p>THE FIFTEENTH AND SIXTEENTH CHAPTERS FORM ONE PROPHECY ON MOAB. (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#001">Isa 15:1-9</a>)
 <p>
 </p><p>Because--rather, "Surely"; literally, "(I affirm) that" [MAURER]. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>night--the time best suited for a hostile incursion (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#004">Isa 21:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#004">Jer 39:4</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Ar--meaning in Hebrew, "the city"; the metropolis of Moab, on the south of the river Arnon. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Kir--literally, "a citadel"; not far from Ar, towards the south. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>He--Moab personified. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Bajith--rather, "to the temple" [MAURER]; answering to the "sanctuary" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#012">Isa 16:12</a>), in a similar context. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>to Dibon--Rather, as Dibon was in a plain north of the Arnon, "Dibon (is gone up) to the high places," the usual places of sacrifice in the East. Same town as Dimon (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#009">Isa 15:9</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>to weep--at the sudden calamity. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>over Nebo--rather "in Nebo"; not "on account of" Nebo (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#003">Isa 15:3</a>) [MAURER]. The town Nebo was adjacent to the mountain, not far from the northern shore of the Dead Sea. There it was that Chemosh, the idol of Moab, was worshipped (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#001">Deu 34:1</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Medeba--south of Heshbon, on a hill east of Jordan. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>baldness . . . beard cut off--The Orientals regarded the beard with peculiar veneration. To cut one's beard off is the greatest mark of sorrow and mortification (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#037">Jer 48:37</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#003">Isaiah 15:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">isa 15:3</a></font></span></p>tops of . . . houses--flat; places of resort for prayer, &amp;c., in the East (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#009">Act 10:9</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>weeping abundantly--"melting away in tears." HORSLEY prefers "descending to weep." Thus there is a "parallelism by alternate construction" [LOWTH], or chiasmus; "howl" refers to "tops of houses." "Descending to weep" to "streets" or squares, whither they descend from the housetops.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#004">Isaiah 15:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">isa 15:4</a></font></span></p>Heshbon--an Amorite city, twenty miles east of Jordan; taken by Moab after the carrying away of Israel (compare Jer. 48:1-47). 
 <p>
 </p><p>Elealeh--near Heshbon, in Reuben. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Jahaz--east of Jordan, in Reuben. Near it Moses defeated Sihon. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>therefore--because of the sudden overthrow of their cities. Even the armed men, instead of fighting in defense of their land, shall join in the general cry. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>life, &amp;c.--rather, "his soul is grieved" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#008">Sa1 1:8</a>) [MAURER].
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#005">Isaiah 15:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">isa 15:5</a></font></span></p>My--The prophet himself is moved with pity for Moab. Ministers, in denouncing the wrath of God against sinners, should do it with tender sorrow, not with exultation. 
 <p>
 </p><p>fugitives--fleeing from Moab, wander as far as to Zoar, on the extreme boundary south of the Dead Sea. HORSLEY translates, "her nobility," or "rulers" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#018">Hos 4:18</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>heifer, &amp;c.--that is, raising their voices "like a heifer" (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#034">Jer 48:34</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#036">Jer 48:36</a>). The expression "three years old," implies one at its full vigor (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#009">Gen 15:9</a>), as yet not brought under the yoke; as Moab heretofore unsubdued, but now about to be broken. So <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#018">Jer 31:18</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#013">Hos 4:13</a>. MAURER translates, "Eglath" (in English Version, "a heifer") Shelishijah (that is, the third, to distinguish it from two others of the same name). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>by the mounting up--up the ascent. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Luhith--a mountain in Moab. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Horonaim--a town of Moab not far from Zoar (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#005">Jer 48:5</a>). It means "the two poles," being near caves. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>cry of destruction--a cry appropriate to the destruction which visits their country.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#006">Isaiah 15:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">isa 15:6</a></font></span></p>For--the cause of their flight southwards (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#019">Kg2 3:19</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#025">Kg2 3:25</a>). "For" the northern regions and even the city Nimrim (the very name of which means "limpid waters," in Gilead near Jordan) are without water or herbage.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#007">Isaiah 15:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">isa 15:7</a></font></span></p>Therefore--because of the devastation of the land. 
 <p>
 </p><p>abundance--literally, "that which is over and above" the necessaries of life. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>brook of . . . willows--The fugitives flee from Nimrim, where the waters have failed, to places better watered. Margin has "valley of Arabians"; that is, to the valley on the boundary between them and Arabia-PetrÃ&amp;brvbr;a; now Wady-el Arabah. "Arabia" means a "desert."
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#008">Isaiah 15:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">isa 15:8</a></font></span></p>Eglaim-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#010">Eze 47:10</a>), En-eglaim. Not the Agalum of EUSEBIUS, eight miles from Areopolis towards the south; the context requires a town on the very borders of Moab or beyond them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>Beer-elim--literally, "the well of the Princes"--(so <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#016">Num 21:16-18</a>). Beyond the east borders of Moab.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#009">Isaiah 15:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">isa 15:9</a></font></span></p>Dimon--same as Dibon (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#002">Isa 15:2</a>). Its waters are the Arnon. 
 <p>
 </p><p>full of blood--The slain of Moab shall be so many. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>bring more--fresh calamities, namely, the "lions" afterwards mentioned (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#025">Kg2 17:25</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#006">Jer 5:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#003">Jer 15:3</a>). VITRINGA understands Nebuchadnezzar as meant by "the lion"; but it is plural, "lions." The "more," or in Hebrew, "additions," he explains of the addition made to the waters of Dimon by the streams of blood of the slain.
