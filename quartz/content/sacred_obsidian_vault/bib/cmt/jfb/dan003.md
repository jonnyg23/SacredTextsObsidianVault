 <p>
 </p><p>image--Nebuchadnezzar's confession of God did not prevent him being a worshipper of idols, besides. Ancient idolaters thought that each nation had its own gods, and that, in addition to these, foreign gods might be worshipped. The Jewish religion was the only exclusive one that claimed all homage for Jehovah as the only true God. Men will in times of trouble confess God, if they are allowed to retain their favorite heart-idols. The image was that of Bel, the Babylonian tutelary god; or rather, Nebuchadnezzar himself the personification and representative of the Babylonian empire, as suggested to him by the dream (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#038">Dan 2:38</a>), "Thou art this head of gold." The interval between the dream and the event here was about nineteen years. Nebuchadnezzar had just returned from finishing the Jewish and Syrian wars, the spoils of which would furnish the means of rearing such a colossal statue [PRIDEAUX]. The colossal size makes it likely that the frame was wood, overlaid with gold. The "height," sixty cubits, is so out of proportion with the "breadth," exceeding it ten times, that it seems best to suppose the thickness from breast to back to be intended, which is exactly the right proportion of a well-formed man [AUGUSTINE, The City of God, 15.20]. PRIDEAUX thinks the sixty cubits refer to the image and pedestal together, the image being twenty-seven cubits high, or forty feet, the pedestal thirty-three cubits, or fifty feet. HERODOTUS [1.183] confirms this by mentioning a similar image, forty feet high, in the temple of Belus at Babylon. It was not the same image, for the one here was on the plain of Dura, not in the city.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">dan 3:6</a></font></span></p>No other nation but the Jews would feel this edict oppressive; for it did not prevent them worshipping their own gods besides. It was evidently aimed at the Jews by those jealous of their high position in the king's court, who therefore induced the king to pass an edict as to all recusants, representing such refusal of homage as an act of treason to Nebuchadnezzar as civil and religious "head" of the empire. So the edict under Darius (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#007">Dan 6:7-9</a>) was aimed against the Jews by those jealous of Daniel's influence. The literal image of Nebuchadnezzar is a typical prophecy of "the image of the beast," connected with mystical Babylon, in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#014">Rev 13:14</a>. The second mystical beast there causeth the earth, and them that dwell therein, to worship the first beast, and that as many as would not, should be killed (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#012">Rev 13:12</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#015">Rev 13:15</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>furnace--a common mode of punishment in Babylon (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#022">Jer 29:22</a>). It is not necessary to suppose that the furnace was made for the occasion. Compare "brick-kiln," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#031">Sa2 12:31</a>. Any furnace for common purposes in the vicinity of Dura would serve. CHARDIN, in his travels (A.D. 1671-1677), mentions that in Persia, to terrify those who took advantage of scarcity to sell provisions at exorbitant prices, the cooks were roasted over a slow fire, and the bakers cast into a burning oven.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">dan 3:7</a></font></span></p>None of the Jews seem to have been present, except the officers, summoned specially.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">dan 3:8</a></font></span></p>accused the Jews--literally, "ate the rent limbs," or flesh of the Jews (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#031">Job 31:31</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#004">Psa 14:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#002">Psa 27:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#025">Jer 10:25</a>). Not probably in general, but as <a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#012">Dan 3:12</a> states, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. Why Daniel was not summoned does not appear. Probably he was in some distant part of the empire on state business, and the general summons (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#002">Dan 3:2</a>) had not time to reach him before the dedication. Also, the Jews enemies found it more politic to begin by attacking Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who were nearer at hand, and had less influence, before they proceeded to attack Daniel.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">dan 3:14</a></font></span></p>Is it true--rather, as the Margin [THEODOTION], "Is it purposely that?" &amp;c.

Notwithstanding his "fury," his past favor for them disposes him to give them the opportunity of excusing themselves on the ground that their disobedience had not been intentional; so he gives them another trial to see whether they would still worship the image.

Hesitation, or parleying with sin, is fatal; unhesitating decision is the only safety, where the path of duty is clear (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#019">Mat 10:19</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#028">Mat 10:28</a>).
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#017">Daniel 3:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">dan 3:17</a></font></span></p>If it be so--VATABLUS translates, "Assuredly." English Version agrees better with the original. The sense is, If it be our lot to be cast into the furnace, our God (quoted from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#004">Deu 6:4</a>) is able to deliver us (a reply to Nebuchadnezzar's challenge, "Who is that God that shall deliver you?"); and He will deliver us (either from death, or in death, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#017">Ti2 4:17-18</a>). He will, we trust, literally deliver us, but certainly He will do so spiritually.
 <p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">dan 3:18</a></font></span></p>But if not, &amp;c.--connected with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#018">Dan 3:18</a>. "Whether our God deliver us, as He is able, or do not, we will not serve thy gods." Their service of God is not mercenary in its motive. Though He slay them, they will still trust in Him (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#015">Job 13:15</a>). Their deliverance from sinful compliance was as great a miracle in the kingdom of grace, as that from the furnace was in the kingdom of nature. Their youth, and position as captives and friendless exiles, before the absolute world potentate and the horrid death awaiting them if they should persevere in their faith, all enhance the grace of God, which carried them through such an ordeal.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">dan 3:19</a></font></span></p>visage . . . changed--He had shown forbearance (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#014">Dan 3:14-15</a>) as a favor to them, but now that they despise even his forbearance, anger "fills" him, and is betrayed in his whole countenance. 
 <p>
 </p><p>seven times more than it was wont--literally, "than it was (ever) seen to be heated." Seven is the perfect number; that is, it was made as hot as possible. Passion overdoes and defeats its own end, for the hotter the fire, the sooner were they likely to be put out of pain.

So these are specified [GESENIUS], "their pantaloons, inner tunics (hosen, or stockings, are not commonly worn in the East), and outer mantles." Their being cast in so hurriedly, with all their garments on, enhanced the miracle in that not even the smell of fire passed on their clothes, though of delicate, inflammable material.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">dan 3:23</a></font></span></p>fell down--not cast down; for those who brought the three youths to the furnace, perished by the flames themselves, and so could not cast them in. Here follows an addition in the Septuagint, Syrian, Arabic, and Vulgate versions. "The Prayer of Azarias," and "The Song of the Three Holy Children." It is not in the Chaldee. The hymn was sung throughout the whole Church in their liturgies, from the earliest times [RUFINUS in Commentary on the Apostles Creed, and ATHANASIUS]. The "astonishment" of Nebuchadnezzar in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#024">Dan 3:24</a> is made an argument for its genuineness, as if it explained the cause of his astonishment, namely, "they walked in the midst of the fire praising God, but the angel of the Lord came down into the oven" (vs. 1 and vs. 27 of the Apocryphal addition). But <a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#025">Dan 3:25</a> of English Version explains his astonishment, without need of any addition.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#024">Daniel 3:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">dan 3:24</a></font></span></p>True, O king--God extorted this confession from His enemies' own mouths.

 <p>
 </p><p>loose--whereas they had been cast in "bound." Nebuchadnezzar's question, in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#024">Dan 3:24</a>, is as if he can scarcely trust his own memory as to a fact so recent, now that he sees through an aperture in the furnace what seems to contradict it. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>walking in . . . midst of . . . fire--image of the godly unhurt, and at large (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#036">Joh 8:36</a>), "in the midst of trouble" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#007">Psa 138:7</a>; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#003">Psa 23:3-4</a>). They walked up and down in the fire, not leaving it, but waiting for God's time to bring them out, just as Jesus waited in the tomb as God's prisoner, till God should let Him out (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#026">Act 2:26-27</a>). So Paul (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#008">Co2 12:8-9</a>). So Noah waited in the ark, after the flood, till God brought him forth (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#012">Gen 8:12-18</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>like the Son of God--Unconsciously, like Saul, Caiaphas (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#049">Joh 11:49-52</a>), and Pilate, he is made to utter divine truths. "Son of God" in his mouth means only an "angel" from heaven, as <a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#028">Dan 3:28</a> proves. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#006">Job 1:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#007">Job 38:7</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#007">Psa 34:7-8</a>; and the probably heathen centurion's exclamation (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#054">Mat 27:54</a>). The Chaldeans believed in families of gods: Bel, the supreme god, accompanied by the goddess Mylitta, being the father of the gods; thus the expression he meant: one sprung from and sent by the gods. Really it was the "messenger of the covenant," who herein gave a prelude to His incarnation.

 </p><p>Punished with insanity for his haughtiness, he sinks to the level of the beasts (illustrating <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#006">Psa 49:6</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#012">Psa 49:12</a>). The opposition between bestial and human life, set forth here, is a key to interpret the symbolism in the seventh chapter concerning the beasts and the Son of man. After his conquests, and his building in fifteen days a new palace, according to the heathen historian, ABYDENUS (268 B.C.), whose account confirms Daniel, he ascended upon his palace roof (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#029">Dan 4:29</a>, Margin), whence he could see the surrounding city which he had built, and seized by some deity, he predicted the Persian conquest of Babylon, adding a prayer that the Persian leader might on his return be borne where there is no path of men, and where the wild beasts graze (language evidently derived by tradition from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#032">Dan 4:32-33</a>, though the application is different). In his insanity, his excited mind would naturally think of the coming conquest of Babylon by the Medo-Persians, already foretold to him in the second chapter.
