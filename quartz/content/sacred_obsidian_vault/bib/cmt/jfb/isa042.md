 <p>
 </p><p>my servant--The law of prophetic suggestion leads Isaiah from Cyrus to the far greater Deliverer, behind whom the former is lost sight of. The express quotation in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#018">Mat 12:18-20</a>, and the description can apply to Messiah alone (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006">Psa 40:6</a>; with which compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#006">Exo 21:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#038">Joh 6:38</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007">Phi 2:7</a>). Israel, also, in its highest ideal, is called the "servant" of God (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#003">Isa 49:3</a>). But this ideal is realized only in the antitypical Israel, its representative-man and Head, Messiah (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#015">Mat 2:15</a>, with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001">Hos 11:1</a>). "Servant" was the position assumed by the Son of God throughout His humiliation. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>elect--chosen by God before the foundation of the world for an atonement (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#020">Pe1 1:20</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#008">Rev 13:8</a>). Redemption was no afterthought to remedy an unforeseen evil (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#025">Rom 16:25-26</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#009">Eph 3:9</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#011">Eph 3:11</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#009">Ti2 1:9-10</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#002">Tit 1:2-3</a>). In <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#018">Mat 12:18</a> it is rendered "My beloved"; the only beloved Son, beloved in a sense distinct from all others. Election and the love of God are inseparably joined. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>soul--a human phrase applied to God, because of the intended union of humanity with the Divinity: "I Myself." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>delighteth--is well pleased with, and accepts, as a propitiation. God could have "delighted" in no created being as a mediator (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#021">Isa 42:21</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#005">Isa 63:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#017">Mat 3:17</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>spirit upon him-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#002">Isa 11:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001">Isa 61:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#018">Luk 4:18</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#034">Joh 3:34</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>judgment--the gospel dispensation, founded on justice, the canon of the divine rule and principle of judgment called "the law" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#003">Isa 2:3</a>; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#004">Isa 42:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#004">Isa 51:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#006">Isa 49:6</a>). The Gospel has a discriminating judicial effect: saving to penitents; condemnatory to Satan, the enemy (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#031">Joh 12:31</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#011">Joh 16:11</a>), and the wilfully impenitent (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#039">Joh 9:39</a>). <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#018">Mat 12:18</a> has, "He shall show," for "He shall bring forth," or "cause to go forth." Christ both produced and announced His "judgment." The Hebrew dwells most on His producing it; Matthew on His announcement of it: the two are joined in Him.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#002">Isaiah 42:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">isa 42:2</a></font></span></p>Matthew (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#019">Mat 12:19</a>) marks the kind of "cry" as that of altercation by quoting it, "He shall not strive" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#007">Isa 53:7</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>street--the Septuagint translates "outside." An image from an altercation in a house, loud enough to be heard in the street outside: appropriate of Him who "withdrew Himself" from the public fame created by His miracles to privacy (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#015">Mat 12:15</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#005">Isa 34:5</a>, there, shows another and sterner aspect of His character, which is also implied in the term "judgment").
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#003">Isaiah 42:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">isa 42:3</a></font></span></p>bruised--"It pleased the Lord to bruise Him" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#005">Isa 53:5</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010">Isa 53:10</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#015">Gen 3:15</a>); so He can feel for the bruised. As <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#002">Isa 42:2</a> described His unturbulent spirit towards His violent enemies (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#014">Mat 12:14-16</a>), and His utter freedom from love of notoriety, so <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#003">Isa 42:3</a>, His tenderness in cherishing the first spark of grace in the penitent (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#011">Isa 40:11</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>reed--fragile: easily "shaken with the wind" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#007">Mat 11:7</a>). Those who are at best feeble, and who besides are oppressed by calamity or by the sense of sin. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>break--entirely crush or condemn. Compare "bind up the broken-hearted" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#004">Isa 50:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001">Isa 61:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#028">Mat 11:28</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>flax--put for the lamp-wick, formed of flax. The believer is the lamp (so the Greek, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#015">Mat 5:15</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#035">Joh 5:35</a>): his conscience enlightened by the Holy Ghost is the wick. "Smoking" means "dimly burning," "smouldering," the flame not quite extinct. This expresses the positive side of the penitent's religion; as "bruised reed," the negative. Broken-hearted in himself, but not without some spark of flame: literally, "from above." Christ will supply such a one with grace as with oil. Also, the light of nature smouldering in the Gentiles amidst the hurtful fumes of error. He not only did not quench, but cleared away the mists and superadded the light of revelation. See JEROME, To Algasia, Question 2. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>truth--<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#020">Mat 12:20</a> quotes it, "send forth judgment unto victory." Matthew, under the Spirit, gives the virtual sense, but varies the word, in order to bring out a fresh aspect of the same thing. Truth has in itself the elements of victory over all opposing forces. Truth is the victory of Him who is "the truth" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006">Joh 14:6</a>). The gospel judicial sifting ("judgment") of believers and unbelievers, begun already in part (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#018">Joh 3:18-19</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#039">Joh 9:39</a>), will be consummated victoriously in truth only at His second coming; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#013">Isa 42:13-14</a>, here, and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#032">Mat 12:32</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#036">Mat 12:36</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#041">Mat 12:41-42</a>, show that there is reference to the judicial aspect of the Gospel, especially finally: besides the mild triumph of Jesus coming in mercy to the penitent now (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#002">Isa 42:2</a>), there shall be finally the judgment on His enemies, when the "truth" shall be perfectly developed. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001">Isa 61:1-3</a>, where the two comings are similarly joined (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#004">Psa 2:4-6</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#008">Psa 2:8</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#002">Rev 15:2</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#004">Rev 15:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#011">Rev 19:11-16</a>). On "judgment," see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001">Isa 42:1</a>.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#004">Isaiah 42:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">isa 42:4</a></font></span></p>fail--faint; man in religion may become as the almost expiring flax-wick (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#003">Isa 42:3</a>), but not so He in His purposes of grace. 
 <p>
 </p><p>discouraged--literally, "broken," that is, checked in zeal by discouragements (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#004">Isa 49:4-5</a>). ROSENMULLER not so well translates, "He shall not be too slow on the one hand, nor run too hastily on the other." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>judgment--His true religion, the canon of His judgments and righteous reign. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>isles . . . wait, &amp;c.--The distant lands beyond sea shall put their trust in His gospel way of salvation. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#021">Mat 12:21</a> virtually gives the sense, with the inspired addition of another aspect of the same thing, "In his name shall the Gentiles trust" (as "wait for" here means, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#018">Isa 30:18</a>). "His law" is not something distinct from Himself, but is indeed Himself, the manifestation of God's character ("name") in Christ, who is the embodiment of the law (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#021">Isa 42:21</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#006">Jer 23:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#004">Rom 10:4</a>). "Isles" here, and in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#012">Isa 42:12</a>, may refer to the fact that the populations of which the Church was primarily formed were Gentiles of the countries bordering on the Mediterranean.

To show to all that He is able to sustain the Messiah in His appointed work, and that all might accept Messiah as commissioned by such a mighty God, He commences by announcing Himself as the Almighty Creator and Preserver of all things.

God "set forth" His Son "to be a propitiation (so as) to declare His (God's) righteousness, that God might be just, and (yet) the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025">Rom 3:25-26</a>; compare see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#002">Isa 41:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#013">Isa 45:13</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#008">Isa 50:8-9</a>).

In the ulterior sense the New Testament Church, which was about to be led and enlightened by the Son of God as its leader and shepherd in the wilderness of the Roman empire, until it should reach a city of habitation. "A way . . . they knew not," refers to the various means ployed by Providence for the establishment of the Church in the world, such as would never have occurred to the mind of mere man. "Blind," they are called, as not having heretofore seen God's ways in ordering His Church. 
 <p>
 </p><p>make darkness light, &amp;c.--implies that the glorious issue would only be known by the event itself [VITRINGA]. The same holds good of the individual believer (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#021">Isa 30:21</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#007">Psa 107:7</a>; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#006">Hos 2:6</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#014">Hos 2:14</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#008">Eph 5:8</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#005">Heb 13:5</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">isa 42:17</a></font></span></p>turned back . . . ashamed--disappointed in their trust; the same phrase occurs in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#004">Psa 35:4</a>.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">isa 42:18</a></font></span></p>deaf--namely, to the voice of God. 
 <p>
 </p><p>blind--to your duty and interest; wilfully so (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#020">Isa 42:20</a>). In this they differ from "the blind" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#016">Isa 42:16</a>). The Jews are referred to. He had said, God would destroy the heathen idolatry; here he remembers that even Israel, His "servant" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#019">Isa 42:19</a>), from whom better things might have been expected, is tainted with this sin.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#019">Isaiah 42:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">isa 42:19</a></font></span></p>my servant--namely, Israel. Who of the heathen is so blind? Considering Israel's high privileges, the heathen's blindness was as nothing compared with that of Israelite idolaters. 
 <p>
 </p><p>my messenger . . . sent--Israel was designed by God to be the herald of His truth to other nations. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>perfect--furnished with institutions, civil and religious, suited to their perfect well-being. Compare the title, "Jeshurun," the perfect one, applied to Israel (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#002">Isa 44:2</a>), as the type of Messiah Or translate, the friend of God, which Israel was by virtue of descent from Abraham, who was so called (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#008">Isa 41:8</a>), [GESENIUS]. The language, "my servant" (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001">Isa 42:1</a>), "messenger" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001">Mal 3:1</a>), "perfect" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#004">Rom 10:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010">Heb 2:10</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#022">Pe1 2:22</a>), can, in the full antitypical sense, only apply to Christ. So <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#021">Isa 42:21</a> plainly refers to Him. "Blind" and "deaf" in His case refer to His endurance of suffering and reproach, as though He neither saw nor heard (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#013">Psa 38:13-14</a>). Thus there is a transition by contrast from the moral blindness of Israel (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#018">Isa 42:18</a>) to the patient blindness and deafness of Messiah [HORSLEY].

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">isa 42:20</a></font></span></p>observest--Thou dost not keep them. The "many things" are the many proofs which all along from the first God had given Israel of His goodness and His power (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#032">Deu 4:32-38</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#002">Deu 29:2-4</a>; Psa. 78:1-72; Psa. 105:1-45). 
 <p>
 </p><p>he--transition from the second to the third person. "Opening . . . ears," that is, though he (Israel) hath his ears open (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#010">Isa 6:10</a>). This language, too (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#019">Isa 42:19</a>), applies to Messiah as Jehovah's servant (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#005">Isa 50:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006">Psa 40:6</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">isa 42:21</a></font></span></p>his righteousness--not His people's, but His own; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#024">Isa 42:24</a> shows that they had no righteousness (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#024">Isa 45:24</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#016">Isa 59:16</a>). God is well pleased with His Son ("in whom My soul delighteth," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001">Isa 42:1</a>), "who fulfils all righteousness" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#015">Mat 3:15</a>) for them, and with them for His sake (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#006">Isa 42:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#016">Psa 71:16</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#019">Psa 71:19</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#017">Mat 5:17</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#003">Rom 10:3-4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#009">Phi 3:9</a>). Perhaps in God's "righteousness" here is included His faithfulness to His promises given to Israel's forefathers [ROSENMULLER]; because of this He is well pleased with Israel, even though displeased with their sin, which He here reproves; but that promise could only be based on the righteousness of Messiah, the promised seed, which is God's righteousness.
