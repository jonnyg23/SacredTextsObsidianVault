 <p>
 </p><p>caterpillar--rather, "the wingless locust"; as it gathers; the Hebrew word for "gathers" is properly used of the gathering of the fruits of harvest (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#010">Isa 32:10</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>running to and fro--namely, in gathering harvest fruits.

 </p><p>
 </p><p>Bashan--afterwards called Batanea (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#013">Isa 2:13</a>).

Perhaps alluding to their being about to be burnt on the funeral pyre (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#033">Isa 30:33</a>).

 <p>
 </p><p>hypocrites--rather, "the profane"; "the abandoned" [HORSLEY].

Fire is a common image for the divine judgments (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#006">Isa 29:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#030">Isa 30:30</a>).

 <p>
 </p><p>bread . . . waters--image from the expected siege by Sennacherib; however besieged by trials without, the godly shall have literal and spiritual food, as God sees good for them (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#017">Isa 41:17</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#025">Psa 37:25</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#010">Psa 34:10</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#015">Psa 132:15</a>).

 <p>
 </p><p>king in . . . beauty--not as now, Hezekiah in sackcloth, oppressed by the enemy, but King Messiah (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#001">Isa 32:1</a>) "in His beauty" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#010">Sol 5:10</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#016">Sol 5:16</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#003">Rev 4:3</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>land . . . very far off--rather, "the land in its remotest extent" (no longer pent up as Hezekiah was with the siege); see Margin. For Jerusalem is made the scene of the king's glory (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#020">Isa 33:20</a>, &amp;c.), and it could not be said to be "very far off," unless the far-off land be heaven, the Jerusalem above, which is to follow the earthly reign of Messiah at literal Jerusalem (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#017">Isa 65:17-19</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#017">Jer 3:17</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#001">Rev 21:1-2</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#010">Rev 21:10</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">isa 33:18</a></font></span></p>meditate--on the "terror" caused by the enemy, but now past. 
 <p>
 </p><p>where, &amp;c.--the language of the Jews exulting over their escape from danger. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>scribe--who enrolled the army [MAURER]; or, who prescribed the tribute to be paid [ROSENMULLER]; or, who kept an account of the spoil. "The principal scribe of the host" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#019">Kg2 25:19</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#025">Jer 52:25</a>). The Assyrian records are free from the exaggerations of Egyptian records. Two scribes are seen in every Assyrian bas-relief, writing down the various objects brought to them, the heads of the slain, prisoners, cattle, sheep, &amp;c. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>receiver--"weigher," Margin. LAYARD mentions, among the Assyrian inscriptions, "a pair a scales for weighing the spoils." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>counted . . . towers--he whose duty it was to reconnoitre and report the strength of the city to be besieged.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#019">Isaiah 33:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">isa 33:19</a></font></span></p>fierce people--The Assyrians shall not be allowed to enter Jerusalem (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#032">Kg2 19:32</a>). Or, thou shalt not any longer see fierce enemies threatening thee as previously; such as the Assyrians, Romans, and the last Antichristian host that is yet to assail Jerusalem (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#049">Deu 28:49-50</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#015">Jer 5:15</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#002">Zac 14:2</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>stammering--barbarous; so "deeper," &amp;c., that is, unintelligible. The Assyrian tongue differed only in dialect from the Hebrew, but in the Assyrian levies were many of non-Semitic race and language, as the Medes, Elamites, &amp;c. (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#011">Isa 28:11</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#020">Isaiah 33:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">isa 33:20</a></font></span></p>solemnities--solemn assemblies at the great feasts (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#029">Isa 30:29</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#004">Psa 42:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#012">Psa 48:12</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>not . . . taken down . . . removed--image from captives "removed" from their land (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#017">Isa 36:17</a>). There shall be no more "taking away" to an enemy's land. Or else, from nomads living in shifting tents. The saints, who sojourned once in tabernacles as pilgrims, shall have a "building of God--eternal in the heavens" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001">Co2 5:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#009">Heb 11:9-10</a>; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#002">Isa 54:2</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>stakes--driven into the ground; to these the "cords" were fastened. Christ's Church shall never fall (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018">Mat 16:18</a>). So individual believers (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#012">Rev 3:12</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#021">Isaiah 33:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">isa 33:21</a></font></span></p>there--namely, in Jerusalem. 
 <p>
 </p><p>will be . . . rivers--Jehovah will be as a broad river surrounding our city (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#006">Isa 19:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#008">Nah 3:8</a>), and this, too, a river of such a kind as no ship of war can pass (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#001">Isa 26:1</a>). Jerusalem had not the advantage of a river; Jehovah will be as one to it, affording all the advantages, without any of the disadvantages of one. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>galley with oars--war vessels of a long shape, and propelled by oars; merchant vessels were broader and carried sail. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>gallant--same Hebrew word as for "glorious," previously; "mighty" will suit both places; a ship of war is meant. No "mighty vessel" will dare to pass where the "mighty Lord" stands as our defense.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#022">Isaiah 33:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">isa 33:22</a></font></span></p>Lord--thrice repeated, as often: the Trinity (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#024">Num 6:24-26</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>judge . . . lawgiver . . . king--perfect ideal of the theocracy, to be realized under Messiah alone; the judicial, legislative, and administrative functions as king to be exercised by Him in person (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004">Isa 11:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#001">Isa 32:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#012">Jam 4:12</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#023">Isaiah 33:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">isa 33:23</a></font></span></p>tacklings--Continuing the allegory in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#021">Isa 33:21</a>, he compares the enemies' host to a war galley which is deprived of the tacklings or cords by which the mast is sustained and the sail is spread; and which therefore is sure to be wrecked on "the broad river" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#021">Isa 33:21</a>), and become the prey of Israel. 
 <p>
 </p><p>they--the tacklings, "hold not firm the base of the mast." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>then--when the Assyrian host shall have been discomfited. Hezekiah had given Sennacherib three hundred talents of silver, and thirty of gold (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#014">Kg2 18:14-16</a>), and had stripped the temple of its gold to give it to him; this treasure was probably part of the prey found in the foe's camp. After the invasion, Hezekiah had so much wealth that he made an improper display of it (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#013">Kg2 20:13-15</a>); this wealth, probably, was in part got from the Assyrian. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>the lame--Even the most feeble shall spoil the Assyrian camp (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#006">Isa 35:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#006">Sa2 5:6</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#024">Isaiah 33:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">isa 33:24</a></font></span></p>sick--SMITH thinks the allusion is to the beginning of the pestilence by which the Assyrians were destroyed, and which, while sparing the righteous, affected some within the city ("sinners in Zion"); it may have been the sickness that visited Hezekiah (Isa. 38:1-22). In the Jerusalem to come there shall be no "sickness," because there will be no "iniquity," it being forgiven (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#003">Psa 103:3</a>). The latter clause of the verse contains the cause of the former (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#005">Mar 2:5-9</a>).
 <p>
 </p><p>The thirty-fourth and thirty-fifth chapters form one prophecy, the former part of which denounces God's judgment against His people's enemies, of whom Edom is the representative; the second part, of the flourishing state of the Church consequent on those judgments. This forms the termination of the prophecies of the first part of Isaiah (the thirty-sixth through thirty-ninth chapters being historical) and is a kind of summary of what went before, setting forth the one main truth, Israel shall be delivered from all its foes, and happier times shall succeed under Messiah.
