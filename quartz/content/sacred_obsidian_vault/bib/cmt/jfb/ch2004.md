 <p>
 </p><p>he made an altar of brass--Steps must have been necessary for ascending so elevated an altar, but the use of these could be no longer forbidden (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#026">Exo 20:26</a>) after the introduction of an official costume for the priests (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#042">Exo 28:42</a>). It measured thirty-five feet by thirty-five, and in height seventeen and a half feet. The thickness of the metal used for this altar is nowhere given; but supposing it to have been three inches, the whole weight of the metal would not be under two hundred tons [NAPIER].

 <p>
 </p><p>he made a molten sea--(See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#023">Kg1 7:23</a>), as in that passage "knops" occur instead of "oxen." It is generally supposed that the rows of ornamental knops were in the form of ox heads.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">ch2 4:3</a></font></span></p>Two rows of oxen were cast, when it was cast--The meaning is, that the circular basin and the brazen oxen which supported it were all of one piece, being cast in one and the same mould. There is a difference in the accounts given of the capacity of this basin, for while in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#026">Kg1 7:26</a> it is said that two thousand baths of water could be contained in it, in this passage no less than three thousand are stated. It has been suggested that there is here a statement not merely of the quantity of water which the basin held, but that also which was necessary to work it, to keep it flowing as a fountain; that which was required to fill both it and its accompaniments. In support of this view, it may be remarked that different words are employed: the one in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#026">Kg1 7:26</a> rendered contained; the two here rendered, received and held. There was a difference between receiving and holding. When the basin played as a fountain, and all its parts were filled for that purpose, the latter, together with the sea itself, received three thousand baths; but the sea exclusively held only two thousand baths, when its contents were restricted to those of the circular basin. It received and held three thousand baths [CALMET, Fragments].

 <p>
 </p><p>ten lavers--(See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#027">Kg1 7:27</a>). The laver of the tabernacle had probably been destroyed. The ten new ones were placed between the porch and the altar, and while the molten sea was for the priests to cleanse their hands and feet, these were intended for washing the sacrifices.

The increased number was not only in conformity with the characteristic splendor of the edifice, but also a standing emblem to the Hebrews, that the growing light of the word was necessary to counteract the growing darkness in the world [LIGHTFOOT].
