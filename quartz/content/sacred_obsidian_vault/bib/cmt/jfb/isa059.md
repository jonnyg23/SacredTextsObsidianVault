 <p>
 </p><p>hands . . . fingers--Not merely the "hands" perpetrate deeds of grosser enormity ("blood"), but the "fingers" commit more minute acts of "iniquity." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>lips . . . tongue--The lips "speak" openly "lies," the tongue "mutters" malicious insinuations ("perverseness"; perverse misrepresentations of others) (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#028">Jer 6:28</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#004">Jer 9:4</a>).

 </p><p>spider's web--This refers not to the spider's web being made to entrap, but to its thinness, as contrasted with substantial "garments," as <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#006">Isa 59:6</a> shows. Their works are vain and transitory (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#014">Job 8:14</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#018">Pro 11:18</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>eateth . . . their eggs--he who partakes in their plans, or has anything to do with them, finds them pestiferous. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>that which is crushed--The egg, when it is broken, breaketh out as a viper; their plans, however specious in their undeveloped form like the egg, when developed, are found pernicious. Though the viper is viviparous (from which "vi-per" is derived), yet during gestation, the young are included in eggs, which break at the birth [BOCHART]; however, metaphors often combine things without representing everything to the life.

 <p>
 </p><p>run . . . haste-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#015">Rom 3:15</a>). Contrast David's "running and hasting" in the ways of God (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#032">Psa 119:32</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#060">Psa 119:60</a>).

 <p>
 </p><p>judgment--justice. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>crooked--the opposite of "straightforward" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#015">Pro 2:15</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#018">Pro 28:18</a>).

"The vindication of our just rights by God is withheld by Him from us." 
 <p>
 </p><p>us--In <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#008">Isa 59:8</a> and previous verses, it was "they," the third person; here, "us . . . we," the first person. The nation here speaks: God thus making them out of their own mouth condemn themselves; just as He by His prophet had condemned them before. Isaiah includes himself with his people and speaks in their name. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>justice--God's justice bringing salvation (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#013">Isa 46:13</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>light--the dawn of returning prosperity. 
 </p><p>

 <p>
 </p><p>stumble at noon . . . as . . . night--There is no relaxation of our evils; at the time when we might look for the noon of relief, there is still the night of our calamity. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>in desolate places--rather, to suit the parallel words "at noonday," in fertile (literally, "fat"; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#028">Gen 27:28</a>) fields [GESENIUS] (where all is promising) we are like the dead (who have no hope left them); or, where others are prosperous, we wander about as dead men; true of all unbelievers (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#010">Isa 26:10</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#017">Luk 15:17</a>).

 </p><p>
 </p><p>salvation--retribution in kind: because not salvation, but "destruction" was "in their paths" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#007">Isa 59:7</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#012">Isaiah 59:12</a></p>

The act, the word, and the thought of apostasy, are all here marked: transgression and departing, &amp;c.; lying (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#004">Isa 59:4</a>), and speaking, &amp;c.; conceiving and uttering from the heart.

 </p><p>
 </p><p>Lord saw it--The iniquity of Israel, so desperate as to require nothing short of Jehovah's interposition to mend it, typifies the same necessity for a Divine Mediator existing in the deep corruption of man; Israel, the model nation, was chosen to illustrate his awful fact.
 </p><p>

 </p><p>
 </p><p>his righteousness--the "arm" of Messiah.

 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#017">Isaiah 59:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">isa 59:17</a></font></span></p>Messiah is represented as a warrior armed at all points, going forth to vindicate His people. Owing to the unity of Christ and His people, their armor is like His, except that they have no "garments of vengeance" (which is God's prerogative, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#019">Rom 12:19</a>), or "cloak of zeal" (in the sense of judicial fury punishing the wicked; this zeal belongs properly to God, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#016">Kg2 10:16</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#002">Rom 10:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#006">Phi 3:6</a>; "zeal," in the sense of anxiety for the Lord's honor, they have, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#011">Num 25:11</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#013">Num 25:13</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#009">Psa 69:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#011">Co2 7:11</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#002">Co2 9:2</a>); and for "salvation," which is of God alone (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#008">Psa 3:8</a>), they have as their helmet, "the hope of salvation" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#008">Th1 5:8</a>). The "helmet of salvation" is attributed to them (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#014">Eph 6:14</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#017">Eph 6:17</a>) in a secondary sense; namely, derived from Him, and as yet only in hope, not fruition (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#024">Rom 8:24</a>). The second coming here, as often, is included in this representation of Messiah. His "zeal" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#015">Joh 2:15-17</a>) at His first coming was but a type of His zeal and vengeance against the foes of God at His second coming (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#008">Th2 1:8-10</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#011">Rev 19:11-21</a>).

This verse predicts the judgments at the Lord's second coming, which shall precede the final redemption of His people (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#018">Isa 66:18</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#015">Isa 66:15-16</a>).

 </p><p>
 </p><p>lift up a standard--rather, from a different Hebrew root, "shall put him to flight," "drive him away" [MAURER]. LOWTH, giving a different sense to the Hebrew for "enemy" from that in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#018">Isa 59:18</a>, and a forced meaning to the Hebrew for "Spirit of the Lord," translates, "When He shall come as a river straitened in its course, which a mighty wind drives along."
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#020">Isaiah 59:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">isa 59:20</a></font></span></p>to Zion-- <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026">Rom 11:26</a> quotes it, "out of Zion." Thus Paul, by inspiration, supplements the sense from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#007">Psa 14:7</a> : He was, and is come to Zion, first with redemption, being sprung as man out of Zion. The Septuagint translates "for the sake of Zion." Paul applies this verse to the coming restoration of Israel spiritually. 
 <p>
 </p><p>them that turn from-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026">Rom 11:26</a>). "shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob"; so the Septuagint, Paul herein gives the full sense under inspiration. They turn from transgression, because He first turns them from it, and it from them (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#004">Psa 130:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#021">Lam 5:21</a>).

Jehovah addresses Messiah the representative and ideal Israel. The literal and spiritual Israel are His seed, to whom the promise is to be fulfilled (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#030">Psa 22:30</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>spirit . . . not depart . . . for ever-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#031">Jer 31:31-37</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#020">Mat 28:20</a>).
 </p><p>
 </p><p>An ode of congratulation to Zion on her restoration at the Lord's second advent to her true position as the mother church from which the Gospel is to be diffused to the whole Gentile world; the first promulgation of the Gospel among the Gentiles, beginning at Jerusalem [<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#047">Luk 24:47</a>], is an earnest of this. The language is too glorious to apply to anything that as yet has happened.
