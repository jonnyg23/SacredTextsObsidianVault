 </p><p>to do all these abominations--namely, those enumerated (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#009">Jer 7:9</a>).

 <p>
 </p><p>seen it--namely, that ye treat My house as if it were a den of thieves. Jehovah implies more than is expressed, "I have seen and will punish it" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#007">Isa 56:7</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#013">Mat 21:13</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">jer 7:12</a></font></span></p>my place . . . in Shiloh--God caused His tabernacle to be set up in Shiloh in Joshua's days (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#001">Jos 18:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#031">Jdg 18:31</a>). In Eli's time God gave the ark, which had been at Shiloh, into the hands of the Philistines (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#006">Jer 26:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#010">Sa1 4:10-11</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#056">Psa 78:56-61</a>).

 </p><p>at the first--implying that Shiloh exceeded the Jewish temple in antiquity. But God's favor is not tied down to localities (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#044">Act 7:44</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>my people Israel--Israel was God's people, yet He spared it not when rebellious: neither will He spare Judah, now that it rebels, though heretofore it has been His people.

 <p>
 </p><p>cakes . . . queen of heaven--Cakes were made of honey, fine flour, &amp;c., in a round flat shape to resemble the disc of the moon, to which they were offered. Others read as Margin, "the frame of heaven," that is, the planets generally; so the Septuagint here; but elsewhere the Septuagint translates, "queen of heaven." The PhÅnicians called the moon Ashtoreth or Astarte: the wife of Baal or Moloch, the king of heaven. The male and female pair of deities symbolized the generative powers of nature; hence arose the introduction of prostitution in the worship. The Babylonians worshipped Ashtoreth as Mylitta, that is, generative. Our Monday, or Moon-day, indicates the former prevalence of moon worship (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#011">Isa 65:11</a>). 
 </p><p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">jer 7:21</a></font></span></p>Put . . . burnt offerings unto . . . sacrifices . . . eat flesh--Add the former (which the law required to be wholly burnt) to the latter (which were burnt only in part), and "eat flesh" even off the holocausts or burnt offerings. As far as I am concerned, saith Jehovah, you may do with one and the other alike. I will have neither (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#011">Isa 1:11</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#013">Hos 8:13</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#021">Amo 5:21-22</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">jer 7:22</a></font></span></p>Not contradicting the divine obligation of the legal sacrifices. But, "I did not require sacrifices, unless combined with moral obedience" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#008">Psa 50:8</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#016">Psa 51:16-17</a>). The superior claim of the moral above the positive precepts of the law was marked by the ten commandments having been delivered first, and by the two tables of stone being deposited alone in the ark (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#006">Deu 5:6</a>). The negative in Hebrew often supplies the want of the comparative: not excluding the thing denied, but only implying the prior claim of the thing set in opposition to it (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#006">Hos 6:6</a>). "I will have mercy, and not sacrifice" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#022">Sa1 15:22</a>). Love to God is the supreme end, external observances only means towards that end. "The mere sacrifice was not so much what I commanded, as the sincere submission to My will gives to the sacrifice all its virtue" [MAGEE, Atonement, Note 57].
