 <p>
 </p><p>the men of Kirjath-jearim--"the city of woods," also Kirjath-baal (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#060">Jos 15:60</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#014">Jos 18:14</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#005">Ch1 13:5-6</a>). It was the nearest town to Beth-shemesh and stood on a hill. This was the reason of the message (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#021">Sa1 6:21</a>), and why this was chosen for the convenience of people turning their faces to the ark (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#029">Kg1 8:29-35</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#002">Psa 28:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#010">Dan 6:10</a>).

But that length of time had passed when the Israelites began to revive from their sad state of religious decline. The capture of the ark had produced a general indifference either as to its loss or its recovery. 
 <p>
 </p><p>all the house of Israel lamented after the Lord--They were then brought, doubtless by the influence of Samuel's exhortations, to renounce idolatry, and to return to the national worship of the true God.

 <p>
 </p><p>Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel--A great national reformation was effected through the influence of Samuel. Disgusted with their foreign servitude, and panting for the restoration of liberty and independence, they were open to salutary impressions; and convinced of their errors, they renounced idolatry. The re-establishment of the faith of their fathers was inaugurated at a great public meeting, held at Mizpeh in Judah, and hallowed by the observance of impressive religious solemnities. The drawing water, and pouring it out before the Lord, seems to have been a symbolical act by which, in the people's name, Samuel testified their sense of national corruption, their need of that moral purification of which water is the emblem, and their sincere desire to pour out their hearts in repentance before God.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">sa1 7:6</a></font></span></p>Samuel judged . . . Israel in Mizpeh--At the time of Eli's death he could not have much exceeded twenty years of age; and although his character and position must have given him great influence, it does not appear that hitherto he had done more than prophets were wont to do. Now he entered on the duties of a civil magistrate.

 <p>
 </p><p>when the Philistines heard, &amp;c.--The character and importance of the national convention at Mizpeh were fully appreciated by the Philistines. They discerned in it the rising spirit of religious patriotism among the Israelites that was prepared to throw off the yoke of their domination. Anxious to crush it at the first, they made a sudden incursion while the Israelites were in the midst of their solemn celebration. Unprepared for resistance, they besought Samuel to supplicate the divine interposition to save them from their enemies. The prophet's prayers and sacrifice were answered by such a tremendous storm of thunder and lightning that the assailants, panic-struck, were disordered and fled. The Israelites, recognizing the hand of God, rushed courageously on the foe they had so much dreaded and committed such immense havoc, that the Philistines did not for long recover from this disastrous blow. This brilliant victory secured peace and independence to Israel for twenty years, as well as the restitution of the usurped territory.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">sa1 7:12</a></font></span></p>Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen--on an open spot between the town and "the crag" (some well-known rock in the neighborhood). A huge stone pillar was erected as a monument of their victory (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#001">Lev 26:1</a>). The name--Eben-ezer--is thought to have been written on the face of it.
