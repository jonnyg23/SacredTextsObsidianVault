 <p>
 </p><p>Libnah--meaning "whiteness," the Blanche-garde of the Crusaders [STANLEY]. EUSEBIUS and JEROME place it more south, in the district of Eleutheropolis, ten miles northwest of Lachish, which Sennacherib had captured (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#002">Isa 36:2</a>). Libnah was in Judea and given to the priests (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#054">Ch1 6:54</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#057">Ch1 6:57</a>).

Egypt was in part governed by three successive Ethiopian monarchs, for forty or fifty years: Sabacho, Sevechus, and Tirhakah. Sevechus retired from Lower Egypt owing to the resistance of the priests, whereupon Sethos, a prince-priest, obtained supreme power with Tanis (Zoan in Scripture), or Memphis, as his capital. The Ethiopians retained Upper Egypt under Tirhakah, with Thebes as the capital. Tirhakah's fame as a conqueror rivalled that of Sesostris; he, and one at least, of the Pharaohs of Lower Egypt, were Hezekiah's allies against Assyria. The tidings of his approach made Sennacherib the more anxious to get possession of Jerusalem before his arrival. 
 <p>

Gozan is the name of the district, Chabour of the river. 
 <p>
 </p><p>Haran--more to the west. Abraham removed to it from Ur (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#031">Gen 11:31</a>); the Carroe of the Romans. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Rezeph--farther west, in Syria. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Eden--There is an ancient village, Adna, north of Baghdad. Some think Eden to be the name of a region (of Mesopotamia or its vicinity) in which was Paradise; Paradise was not Eden itself (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#008">Gen 2:8</a>). "A garden in Eden." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Telassar--now Tel-afer, west of Mosul [LAYARD]. Tel means a "hill" in Arabic and Assyrian names.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">isa 37:14</a></font></span></p>spread--unrolled the scroll of writing. God "knows our necessities before we ask Him," but He delights in our unfolding them to Him with filial confidence (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#003">Ch2 20:3</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#011">Ch2 20:11-13</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">isa 37:16</a></font></span></p>dwellest--the Shekinah, or fiery symbol of God's presence, dwelling in the temple with His people, is from shachan, "to dwell" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#022">Exo 25:22</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#001">Psa 80:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#001">Psa 99:1</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>cherubim--derived by transposition from either a Hebrew root, rachab, to "ride"; or rather, barach, to "bless." They were formed out of the same mass of pure gold as the mercy seat itself (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#019">Exo 25:19</a>, Margin). The phrase, "dwellest between the cherubim," arose from their position at each end of the mercy seat, while the Shekinah, and the awful name, JEHOVAH, in written letters, were in the intervening space. They are so inseparably associated with the manifestation of God's glory, that whether the Lord is at rest or in motion, they always are mentioned with Him (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#089">Num 7:89</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#010">Psa 18:10</a>). (1) They are first mentioned (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#024">Gen 3:24</a>) "on the edge of" (as "on the east" may be translated) Eden; the Hebrew for "placed" is properly to "place in a tabernacle," which implies that this was a local tabernacle in which the symbols of God's presence were manifested suitably to the altered circumstances in which man, after the fall, came before God. It was here that Cain and Abel, and the patriarchs down to the flood, presented their offerings: and it is called "the presence of the Lord" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#016">Gen 4:16</a>). When those symbols were removed at the close of that early patriarchal dispensation, small models of them were made for domestic use, called, in Chaldee, "seraphim" or "teraphim." (2) The cherubim, in the Mosaic tabernacle and Solomon's temple, were the same in form as those at the outskirts of Eden: compound figures, combining the distinguishing properties of several creatures: the ox, chief among the tame and useful animals; the lion among the wild ones; the eagle among birds; and man, the head of all (the original headship of man over the animal kingdom, about to be restored in Jesus Christ, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#004">Psa 8:4-8</a>, is also implied in this combination). They are, throughout Scripture, represented as distinct from God; they could not be likenesses of Him which He forbade in any shape. (3) They are introduced in the third or gospel dispensation (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#006">Rev 4:6</a>) as "living creatures" (not so well translated "beasts" in English Version), not angels, but beings closely connected with the redeemed Church. So also in Eze. 1:5-25; 10:1-22. Thus, throughout the three dispensations, they seem to be symbols of those who in every age should officially study and proclaim the manifold wisdom of God. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>thou alone--literally, "Thou art He who alone art God of all the kingdoms"; whereas Sennacherib had classed Jehovah with the heathen gods, he asserts the nothingness of the latter and the sole lordship of the former.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">isa 37:19</a></font></span></p>cast . . . gods into . . . fire--The policy of the Assyrians in order to alienate the conquered peoples from their own countries was, both to deport them elsewhere, and to destroy the tutelary idols of their nation, the strongest tie which bound them to their native land. The Roman policy was just the reverse.

 <p>
 </p><p>virgin . . . daughter--honorable terms. "Virgin" implies that the city is, as yet, inviolate. "Daughter" is an abstract collective feminine personification of the population, the child of the place denoted (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#010">Isa 23:10</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#008">Isa 1:8</a>).

With us to shake the head is a sign of denial or displeasure; but gestures have different meanings in different countries (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#009">Isa 58:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#006">Eze 25:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#015">Zep 2:15</a>).

 </p><p>
 </p><p>sides--rather, "recesses" [G. V. SMITH]. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>fir trees--not cypresses, as some translate; pine foliage and cedars are still found on the northwest side of Lebanon [STANLEY]. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>height of . . . border--In <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#023">Kg2 19:23</a>, "the lodgings of his borders." Perhaps on the ascent to the top there was a place of repose or caravansary, which bounded the usual attempts of persons to ascend [BARNES]. Here, simply, "its extreme height." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>forest of . . . Carmel--rather, "its thickest forest." "Carmel" expresses thick luxuriance (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#018">Isa 10:18</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#017">Isa 29:17</a>).

I have marched into foreign lands where I had to dig wells for the supply of my armies; even the natural destitution of water there did not impede my march. 
 <p>
 </p><p>rivers of . . . besieged places--rather, "the streams (artificial canals from the Nile) of Egypt." "With the sole of my foot," expresses that as soon as his vast armies marched into a region, the streams were drunk up by them; or rather, that the rivers proved no obstruction to the onward march of his armies. So <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#004">Isa 19:4-6</a>, referring to Egypt, "the river--brooks of defense--shall be dried up." HORSLEY, translates the Hebrew for "besieged places," "rocks."

This was the reason why "the inhabitants were of small power before thee" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#027">Isa 37:27</a>), namely, that I ordered it so; yet thou art in My hands, and I know thy ways (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#028">Isa 37:28</a>), and I will check thee (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#029">Isa 37:29</a>). Connect also, "I from ancient times have arranged ('formed') it." However, English Version is supported by <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#013">Isa 33:13</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#006">Isa 45:6</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#021">Isa 45:21</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#005">Isa 48:5</a>.

The two years, in which they were sustained by the spontaneous growth of the earth, were the two in which Judea had been already ravaged by Sennacherib (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#010">Isa 32:10</a>). Thus translate: "Ye did eat (the first year) such as groweth of itself, and in the second year that . . . but in this third year sow ye," &amp;c., for in this year the land shall be delivered from the foe. The fact that Sennacherib moved his camp away immediately after shows that the first two years refer to the past, not to the future [ROSENMULLER]. Others, referring the first two years to the future, get over the difficulty of Sennacherib's speedy departure, by supposing that year to have been the sabbatical year, and the second year the jubilee; no indication of this appears in the context.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_036">isa 37:36</a></font></span></p>Some attribute the destruction to the agency of the plague (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#024">Isa 33:24</a>), which may have caused Hezekiah's sickness, narrated immediately after; but <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#001">Isa 33:1</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#004">Isa 33:4</a>, proves that the Jews spoiled the corpses, which they would not have dared to do, had there been on them infection of a plague. The secondary agency seems, from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#006">Isa 29:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#030">Isa 30:30</a>, to have been a storm of hail, thunder, and lightning (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#022">Exo 9:22-25</a>). The simoon belongs rather to Africa and Arabia than Palestine, and ordinarily could not produce such a destructive effect. Some few of the army, as <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#021">Ch2 32:21</a> seems to imply, survived and accompanied Sennacherib home. HERODOTUS (2.141) gives an account confirming Scripture in so far as the sudden discomfiture of the Assyrian army is concerned. The Egyptian priests told him that Sennacherib was forced to retreat from Pelusium owing to a multitude of field mice, sent by one of their gods, having gnawed the Assyrians' bow-strings and shield-straps. Compare the language (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#033">Isa 37:33</a>), "He shall not shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shields," which the Egyptians corrupted into their version of the story. Sennacherib was as the time with a part of his army, not at Jerusalem, but on the Egyptian frontier, southwest of Palestine. The sudden destruction of the host near Jerusalem, a considerable part of his whole army, as well as the advance of the Ethiopian Tirhakah, induced him to retreat, which the Egyptians accounted for in a way honoring to their own gods. The mouse was the Egyptian emblem of destruction. The Greek Apollo was called Sminthian, from a Cretan word for "a mouse," as a tutelary god of agriculture, he was represented with one foot upon a mouse, since field mice hurt corn. The Assyrian inscriptions, of course, suppress their own defeat, but nowhere boast of having taken Jerusalem; and the only reason to be given for Sennacherib not having, amidst his many subsequent expeditions recorded in the monuments, returned to Judah, is the terrible calamity he had sustained there, which convinced him that Hezekiah was under the divine protection. RAWLINSON says, In Sennacherib's account of his wars with Hezekiah, inscribed with cuneiform characters in the hall of the palace of Koyunjik, built by him (a hundred forty feet long by a hundred twenty broad), wherein even the Jewish physiognomy of the captives is portrayed, there occurs a remarkable passage; after his mentioning his taking two hundred thousand captive Jews, he adds, "Then I prayed unto God"; the only instance of an inscription wherein the name of GOD occurs without a heathen adjunct. The forty-sixth Psalm probably commemorates Judah's deliverance. It occurred in one "night," according to <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#035">Kg2 19:35</a>, with which Isaiah's words, "when they arose early in the morning," &amp;c., are in undesigned coincidence.

The word, "dwelt," is consistent with any indefinite length of time. "Nineveh," so called from Ninus, that is, Nimrod, its founder; his name means "exceedingly impious rebel"; he subverted the existing patriarchal order of society, by setting up a system of chieftainship, founded on conquest; the hunting field was his training school for war; he was of the race of Ham, and transgressed the limits marked by God (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#008">Gen 10:8-11</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#025">Gen 10:25</a>), encroaching on Shem's portion; he abandoned Babel for a time, after the miraculous confusion of tongues and went and founded Nineveh; he was, after death, worshipped as Orion, the constellation (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#009">Job 9:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#031">Job 38:31</a>).

The eagle-headed human figure in Assyrian sculptures is no doubt Nisroch, the same as Asshur, the chief Assyrian god; the corresponding goddess was Asheera, or Astarte; this means a "grove," or sacred tree, often found as the symbol of the heavenly hosts (Saba) in the sculptures, as Asshur the Eponymus hero of Assyria (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#011">Gen 10:11</a>) answered to the sun or Baal, Belus, the title of office, "Lord." This explains "image of the grove" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#007">Kg2 21:7</a>). The eagle was worshipper by the ancient Persians and Arabs.

He built the palace on the mound Nebbiyunus, and that called the southwest palace of Nimroud. The latter was destroyed by fire, but his name and wars are recorded on the great bulls taken from the building. He obtained his building materials from the northwest palaces of the ancient dynasty, ending in Pul.
