 <p align="center">A D. 29. Age 32. <i>Decapolis: Bethsaida</i>.</p>  
 <p align="center"><font size="-1">Matthew 14, 1-4; 13-14: Luke 9, 7-11: Mark 6, 17-18; 30-33: John 6, 1-3.</font></p>  
 <p>NOW Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus: and he was perplexed, because it was said of some, that John was risen from the dead. Herod himself had laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife: for John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife.</p>  
 <p>And Herod had married her: and sent an executioner, and beheaded John in the prison. Herod said, John have I beheaded; but who is this of whom I hear such things?</p>  
 <p>And he desired to see Jesus. Jesus’ disciples went and told him [Jesus]. And he went over the sea of Galilee, by ship.</p>  
 <p>¶When the apostles were returned, and were gathered unto Jesus, <i>they</i> told all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught. Jesus said unto them.</p>

 <p>He took his disciples, and went privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida. He went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.</p>  
 <p>The people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran afoot and outwent them, and came together unto him.</p>
