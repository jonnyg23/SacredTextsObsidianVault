 <p align="center">A.D. 30. Age 33. <i>Jerusalem. Golgotha: Calvary</i>.</p>  
 <p align="center"><font size="-1">Matthew 27, 27-38: Mark 15, 16-27: Luke 23, 26-34: John 19, 17-20.</font></p>  
 <p>THE soldiers of the governor led Jesus into the common hall, called Pretorium. They stripped him, and clothed him with purple (put on him a scarlet robe): they platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head.</p>  
 <p>¶Then came Jesus forth wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. They mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!</p>  
 <p>After they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, put his own raiment on him, smote him with their hands, and led him away to crucify <i>him</i>.</p>  
 <p>There followed a great company of people, and of women, which bewailed him. But Jesus turning said,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children. For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed <i>are</i> the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.  
 <p>Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us: and to the hills, Cover us.</p>  
 <p>For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?</p></div>  
 <p>And Jesus bearing his cross went forth.</p>  
 <p>As they came out, one Simon, a man of Cyrene, passed by, coming out of the country: him they compelled, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear <i>it</i> after Jesus.</p>  
 <p>¶When they were come to a place called <i>the place</i> of a skull, which is in the Hebrew, Golgotha: to the place called Calvary, they gave to Jesus wine mingled with myrrh (vinegar mingled with gall): when he had tasted <i>thereof</i>, he would not drink. It was the third hour.</p>  
 <p>And there they crucified Jesus: him and the two malefactors: one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Jesus in the midst. Then said Jesus,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.</div>  
 <p>Pilate wrote a title, and put <i>it</i> on the cross. It was written in Hebrew, <i>and</i> Greek, <i>and</i> Latin: JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.</p>
