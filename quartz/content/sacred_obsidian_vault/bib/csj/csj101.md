 <p align="center">A.D. 96</p>  
 <p align="center">Revelation 2, 12-17.</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">AND to the angel of the church in Pergamos write;  
 <p>These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges;</p>  
 <p>I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, <i>even</i> where Satan's seat <i>is;</i> and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas <i>was</i> my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.</p>  
 <p>But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumbling-block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.</p>  
 <p>¶So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.</p>  
 <p>Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.</p></div>  
 <p>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches;</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth <i>it</i>.</div>
