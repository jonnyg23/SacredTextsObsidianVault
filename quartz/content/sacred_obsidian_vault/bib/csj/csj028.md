 <p align="center">A.D. 28. Age 31 <i>Galilee</i> (<i>Capernaum?</i>).</p>  
 <p align="center"><font size="-1">Luke 7, 36-50.</font></p>  
 <p>ONE of the Pharisees [Simon] desired him that he would eat with him. And Jesus went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat.</p>  
 <p>And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, brought an alabaster box of ointment, and stood weeping; and began to wash Jesus’ feet, and did wipe <i>them</i> with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed <i>them</i> with the ointment. <a name="fr_28"></a><a href="#fn_27"><font size="1">*</font></a></p>  
 <p>Now the Pharisee [Simon, the leper] spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known what manner of woman <i>this is;</i> for she is a sinner. Jesus said unto him,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee:  
 <p>There was a certain creditor which had two debtors; the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty. And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both.</p>  
 <p>Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?</p></div>  
 <p>Simon answered, I suppose that he to whom he forgave most. Jesus said,</p>  
 <p>

 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Thou hast rightly judged.</div>  
 <p>He turned to the woman, and said unto Simon,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Seest thou this woman?  
 <p>I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.</p>  
 <p>Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman, since the time I came in, hath not ceased to kiss my feet.</p>  
 <p>My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.</p>  
 <p>Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loveth much: but to whom little is forgiven, <i>the same</i> loveth little.</p></div>  
 <p>And he said unto her,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Thy sins are forgiven.</div>  
 <p>They that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also? Jesus said to the woman,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.</div>
