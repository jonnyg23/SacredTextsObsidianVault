 <p align="center">A.D. 28. Age 31. <i> Sea of Galilee. Decapolis</i>.</p>  
 <p align="center"><font size="-1">Mark 5, 1-20: Luke 8, 26-40: Matthew 8, 28-34.</font></p>  
 <p>THEY came over unto the other side of the sea, and arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, over against Galilee.</p>  
 <p>And when Jesus was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man <a name="fr_38"></a><a href="#fn_37"><font size="1">*</font></a> with an unclean spirit, who ware no clothes, neither abode in <i>any</i> house, but among the tombs: he had devils long time, and no man could bind him, no not with chains.</p>  
 <p>Jesus said,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Come out of the man, <i>thou</i> unclean spirit.</div>  
 <p>He fell down before Jesus, and cried out, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, <i>thou</i> Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not. And Jesus asked him,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">What <i>is</i> thy name?</div>  
 <p>He answered, Legion: for we are many.</p>  
 <p>Now there was a good way off from them a herd of swine feeding. And</p>

 <p>the devils besought Jesus, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine.</p>  
 <p>Jesus gave them leave: he said,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Go.</div>  
 <p>The unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine; and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters. They were about two thousand.</p>  
 <p>They that fed the swine went and told it in the city. And, behold, the whole city came out: they come to Jesus, and see him that had the legion, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: they were afraid. And the Gadarenes round about besought Jesus to depart out of their coasts.</p>  
 <p>Jesus went up into the ship.</p>  
 <p>Now the man, out of whom the devils were departed, besought Jesus that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Return to thine own house. Go home to thy friends; tell them how the Lord had compassion on thee, and shew them how great things God hath done unto thee.</div>  
 <p>Jesus passed over by ship unto the other side, and came into his own city. Much people <i>gladly</i> received him.</p>
