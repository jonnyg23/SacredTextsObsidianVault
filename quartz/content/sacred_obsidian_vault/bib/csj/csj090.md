 <p align="center">A.D. 30. Age 33. <i>Jerusalem: The Sepulchre</i>.</p>  
 <p align="center"><font size="-1">Mark 15, 42-47: Luke 23, 50-56: John 19, 38-42: Matthew 27, 57-66.</font></p>  
 <p>AND now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath, Joseph of Arimathea went in unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.</p>  
 <p>A rich man of Arimathea, a city of the Jews, Joseph was an honorable counsellor, a good man, and a just (he had not consented to the counsel and deed of them). He also waited for the kingdom of God, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews.</p>  
 <p>This <i>man</i> went boldly in unto Pilate, and begged that he might take away the body of Jesus. Pilate gave him leave.</p>  
 <p>Joseph came therefore, and took the body of Jesus. And there came also Nicodemus (which at the first came by night <a name="fr_106"></a><a href="#fn_102"><font size="1">*</font></a>), and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes.</p>  
 <p>Then took they the body, and wound it in a clean cloth of fine linen, with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.</p>  
 <p>Now in the place where Jesus was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid.</p>  
 <p>When Joseph had laid the body in his own new tomb which he had hewn out in the rock, he rolled a great stone, nigh at hand, to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.</p>  
 <p>The women which came with Jesus from Galilee beheld the sepulchre, and how the body was laid. And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, <i>the mother</i> of Joses, sitting over against the sepulchre. That day was the preparation. They returned (home) and prepared spices and ointments: and rested the sabbath day,</p>

 <p>¶Now the next day, that followed the day of preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came unto Pilate, saying, Sir, that deceiver said, while he was yet alive,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">After three days I will rise again.</div>  
 <p>Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.</p>  
 <p>Pilate said, Ye have a watch: make <i>it</i> as sure as you can. So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.</p>
