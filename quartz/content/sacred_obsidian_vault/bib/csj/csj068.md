 <p align="center">A.D. 30. Age 33. <i>Near Bethany</i>. <i>Jerusalem</i>.</p>  
 <p align="center"><font size="-1">Mark 11, 12-26: Matthew 21, 12-13; 18-22: Luke 19, 45-48.</font></p>  
 <p>NOW on the morrow in the morning, when they were come from Bethany, as Jesus returned into the city, he was hungry: and seeing afar off a fig tree having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon. He found nothing but leaves, for the time of the figs was not <i>yet</i>. And he said,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward. No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever.</div>  
 <p><a name="page_101"><font size="1" color="green">p. 101</font></a></p>  
 <p>Presently the fig tree withered away. The disciples saw it, saying, How soon is the fig tree withered away! Jesus answered,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this <i>which is done</i> to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say to this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done. And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.</div>  
 <p>¶ <a name="fr_83"></a><a href="#fn_79"><font size="1">*</font></a>They came to Jerusalem, and Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought therein, and overthrew the tables of the money changers, and the seats of them that sold doves; and would not suffer that any man should carry <i>any</i> vessel through the temple. And he taught, saying,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">My house is the house of prayer. Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it a den of thieves.</div>  
 <p>The scribes and chief priests heard <i>it</i>, and sought how they might destroy Jesus: for they feared him, because all the people were attentive to hear him.</p>  
 <p>When even was come, he went out of the city. In the morning, as they came by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots. And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto Jesus, Master, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away. Jesus answering saith,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Have faith in God. For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass, he shall have whatsoever he saith.  
 <p>Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive <i>them</i>, and ye shall receive <i>them</i>.</p>  
 <p>And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any; that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses. But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses.</p></div>
