 <p>THEN began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not:  <a name="fr_27"></a><a href="#fn_26"><font size="1">*</font></a></p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. But I say unto</div>

 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you.  
 <p>And thou, Capernaum, which are exalted unto heaven, shall be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.</p></div>  
 <p>¶At that time Jesus said,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes. Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight.  
 <p>All things are delivered unto me of my Father, and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal <i>him</i>.</p>  
 <p>¶Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</p>  
 <p>Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke <i>is</i> easy, and my burden is light.</p></div>

 <p><a name="fn_26"></a><a href="csj027.htm#fr_27">33:*</a> This censure of "the cities," and the homage, "I thank thee, O Father," are from Matthew (11, 20-27). In Luke (10, 13-15 and 21;22) is a paraphrase, being a part of Christ's admonition of the "other seventy . . . sent two and two into every city." Turn to XLVIII in this book.</p>
