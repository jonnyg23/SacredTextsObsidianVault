  <h3 align="center">Douay-Rheims Bible: 2 John</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> The ancient to the lady Elect, and her children, whom I love in the truth, and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> For the sake of the truth which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> Grace be with you, mercy, and peace from God the Father, and from Christ Jesus the Son of the Father; in truth and charity. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> I was exceeding glad, that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> And now I beseech thee, lady, not as writing a new commandment to thee, but that which we have had from the beginning, that we love one another. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> And this is charity, that we walk according to his commandments. For this is the commandment, that, as you have heard from the beginning, you should walk in the same: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> For many seducers are gone out into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh: this is a seducer and an antichrist. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> Look to yourselves, that you lose not the things which you have wrought: but that you may receive a full reward. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> Whosoever revolteth, and continueth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that continueth in the doctrine, the same hath both the Father and the Son. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> If any man come to you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into the house nor say to him, God speed you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> For he that saith unto him, God speed you, communicateth with his wicked works. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> Having more things to write unto you, I would not by paper and ink: for I hope that I shall be with you, and speak face to face: that your joy may be full. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> The children of thy sister Elect salute thee.</p>
