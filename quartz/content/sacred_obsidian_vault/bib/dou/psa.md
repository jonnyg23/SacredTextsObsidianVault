 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> Blessed is the man who hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stood in the way of sinners, nor sat in the chair of pestilence. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> But his will is in the law of the Lord, and on his law he shall meditate day and night. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> And he shall be like a tree which is planted near the running waters, which shall bring forth its fruit, in due season. And his leaf shall not fall off: and all whosoever he shall do shall prosper. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> Not so the wicked, not so: but like the dust, which the wind driveth from the face of the earth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> Therefore the wicked shall not rise again in judgment: nor sinners in the council of the just. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> For the Lord knoweth the way of the just: and the way of the wicked shall perish. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> Why have the Gentiles raged, and the people devised vain things? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> The kings of the earth stood up, and the princes met together, against the Lord and against his Christ. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> Let us break their bonds asunder: and let us cast away their yoke from us. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> He that dwelleth in heaven shall laugh at them: and the Lord shall deride them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> Then shall he speak to them in his anger, and trouble them in his rage. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> But I am appointed king by him over Sion his holy mountain, preaching his commandment. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> The Lord hath said to me: Thou art my son, this day have I begotten thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> Ask of me, and I will give thee the Gentiles for thy inheritance, and the utmost parts of the earth for thy possession. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> Thou shalt rule them with a rod of iron, and shalt break them in pieces like a potter's vessel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> And now, O ye kings, understand: receive instruction, you that judge the earth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> Serve ye the Lord with fear: and rejoice unto him with trembling. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> Embrace discipline, lest at any time the Lord be angry, and you perish from the just way. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> When his wrath shall be kindled in a short time, blessed are all they that trust in him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> The psalm of David when he fled from the face of his son Absalom. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> Why, O Lord, are they multiplied that afflict me? many are they who rise up against me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> Many say to my soul: There is no salvation for him in his God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> But thou, O Lord art my protector, my glory, and the lifter up of my head. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> I have cried to the Lord with my voice: and he hath heard me from his holy hill. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> I have slept and taken my rest: and I have risen up, because the Lord hath protected me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> I will not fear thousands of the people, surrounding me: arise, O Lord; save me, O my God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> For thou hast struck all them who are my adversaries without cause: thou hast broken the teeth of sinners. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> Salvation is of the Lord: and thy blessing is upon thy people. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> Unto the end, in verses. A psalm of David. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> When I called upon him, the God of my justice heard me: when I was in distress, thou hast enlarged me. Have mercy on me: and hear my prayer. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> O ye sons of men, how long will you be dull of heart? why do you love vanity, and seek after lying? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> Know ye also that the Lord hath made his holy one wonderful: the Lord will hear me when I shall cry unto him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> Be angry, and sin not: the things you say in your hearts, be sorry for them upon your beds. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> Offer up the sacrifice of justice, and trust in the Lord: many say, Who sheweth us good things? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> The light of thy countenance O Lord, is signed upon us: thou hast given gladness in my heart. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> By the fruit of their corn, their wine and oil, they are multiplied. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:9">4:9</a> In peace in the selfsame I will sleep, and I will rest: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:10">4:10</a> for thou, O Lord, singularly hast settled me in hope. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:1">5:1</a> Unto the end, for her that obtaineth the inheritance. A psalm of David. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:2">5:2</a> Give ear, O Lord, to my words, understand my cry. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:3">5:3</a> Hearken to the voice of my prayer, O my King and my God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:4">5:4</a> For to thee will I pray: O Lord, in the morning thou shalt hear my voice. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:5">5:5</a> In the morning I will stand before thee, and will see: because thou art not a God that willest iniquity. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:6">5:6</a> Neither shall the wicked dwell near thee: nor shall the unjust abide before thy eyes. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:7">5:7</a> Thou hatest all the workers of iniquity: Thou wilt destroy all that speak a lie. The bloody and the deceitful man the Lord will abhor. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:8">5:8</a> But as for me in the multitude of thy mercy, I will come into thy house; I will worship towards thy holy temple, in thy fear. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:9">5:9</a> Conduct me, O Lord, in thy justice: because of my enemies, direct my way in thy sight. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:10">5:10</a> for there is no truth in their mouth; their heart is vain. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:11">5:11</a> Their throat is an open sepulchre: they dealt deceitfully with their tongues: judge them, O God. Let them fall from their devices: according to the multitude of their wickedness cast them out: for they have provoked thee, O Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:12">5:12</a> But let all them be glad that hope in thee: they shall rejoice for ever, and thou shalt dwell in them. And all they that love thy name shall glory in thee: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:13">5:13</a> For thou wilt bless the just. O Lord, thou hast crowned us, as with a shield of thy good will. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:1">6:1</a> Unto the end, in verses, a psalm for David, for the octave. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:2">6:2</a> O Lord, rebuke me not in thy indignation, nor chastise me in thy wrath. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:3">6:3</a> Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am weak: heal me, O Lord, for my bones are troubled. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:4">6:4</a> And my soul is troubled exceedingly: but thou, O Lord, how long? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:5">6:5</a> Turn to me, O Lord, and deliver my soul: O save me for thy mercy's sake. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:6">6:6</a> For there is no one in death, that is mindful of thee: and who shall confess to thee in hell? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:7">6:7</a> I have laboured in my groanings, every night I will wash my bed: I will water my couch with my tears. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:8">6:8</a> My eye is troubled through indignation: I have grown old amongst all my enemies. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:9">6:9</a> Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity: for the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:10">6:10</a> The Lord hath heard my supplication: the Lord hath received my prayer. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:11">6:11</a> Let all my enemies be ashamed, and be very much troubled: let them be turned back, and be ashamed very speedily. </p>

 <p><a name="an_7:2">7:2</a> O Lord my God, in thee have I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:3">7:3</a> Lest at any time he seize upon my soul like a lion, while there is no one to redeem me, nor to save. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:4">7:4</a> O Lord my God, if I have done this thing, if there be iniquity in my hands: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:5">7:5</a> If I have rendered to them that repaid me evils, let me deservedly fall empty before my enemies. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:6">7:6</a> Let the enemy pursue my soul, and take it, and tread down my life on the earth, and bring down my glory to the dust. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:7">7:7</a> Rise up, O Lord, in thy anger: and be thou exalted in the borders of my enemies. And arise, O Lord my God, in the precept which thou hast commanded: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:8">7:8</a> and a congregation of people shall surround thee. And for their sakes return thou on high. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:9">7:9</a> The Lord judgeth the people. Judge me, O Lord, according to my justice, and according to my innocence in me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:10">7:10</a> The wickedness of sinners shall be brought to nought: and thou shalt direct the just: the searcher of hearts and reins is God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:11">7:11</a> Just is my help from the Lord: who saveth the upright of heart. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:12">7:12</a> God is a just judge, strong and patient: is he angry every day? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:13">7:13</a> Except you will be converted, he will brandish his sword: he hath bent his bow and made it ready. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:14">7:14</a> And in it he hath prepared the instruments of death, he hath made ready his arrows for them that burn. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:15">7:15</a> Behold he hath been in labour with injustice; he hath conceived sorrow, and brought forth iniquity. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:16">7:16</a> He hath opened a pit and dug it; and he is fallen into the hole he made. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:17">7:17</a> His sorrow shall be turned on his own head: and his iniquity shall comedown upon his crown. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:18">7:18</a> I will give glory to the Lord according to his justice: and will sing to the name of the Lord the most high. </p>

 <p><a name="an_8:3">8:3</a> Out of the mouth of infants and of sucklings thou hast perfected praise, because of thy enemies, that thou mayst destroy the enemy and the avenger. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:4">8:4</a> For I will behold thy heavens, the works of thy fingers: the moon and the stars which thou hast founded. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:5">8:5</a> What is man that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man that thou visitest him? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:6">8:6</a> Thou hast made him a little less than the angels, thou hast crowned him with glory and honour: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:7">8:7</a> and hast set him over the works of thy hands. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:8">8:8</a> Thou hast subjected all things under his feet, all sheep and oxen: moreover the beasts also of the fields. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:9">8:9</a> The birds of the air, and the fishes of the sea, that pass through the paths of the sea. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:10">8:10</a> O Lord our Lord, how admirable is thy name in all the earth! </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:1">9:1</a> Unto the end, for the hidden things of the Son. A psalm for David. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:2">9:2</a> I will give praise to thee, O Lord, with my whole heart: I will relate all thy wonders. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:3">9:3</a> I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing to thy name, O thou most high. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:4">9:4</a> When my enemy shall be turned back: they shall be weakened and perish before thy face. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:5">9:5</a> For thou hast maintained my judgment and my cause: thou hast sat on the throne, who judgest justice. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:6">9:6</a> Thou hast rebuked the Gentiles, and the wicked one hath perished: thou hast blotted out their name for ever and ever. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:7">9:7</a> The swords of the enemy have failed unto the end: and their cities thou hast destroyed. Their memory hath perished with a noise. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:8">9:8</a> but the Lord remaineth for ever. He hath prepared his throne in judgment: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:9">9:9</a> and he shall judge the world in equity, he shall judge the people in justice. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:10">9:10</a> And the Lord is become a refuge for the poor: a helper in due time in tribulation. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:11">9:11</a> And let them trust in thee who know thy name: for thou hast not forsaken them that seek thee, O Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:12">9:12</a> Sing ye to the Lord, who dwelleth in Sion: declare his ways among the Gentiles: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:13">9:13</a> For requiring their blood he hath remembered the: he hath not forgotten the cry of the poor. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:14">9:14</a> Have mercy on me, O Lord: see my humiliation which I suffer from my enemies. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:15">9:15</a> Thou that liftest me up from the gates of death, that I may declare all thy praises in the gates of the daughter of Sion. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:16">9:16</a> I will rejoice in thy salvation: the Gentiles have stuck fast in the destruction which they have prepared. Their foot hath been taken in the very snare which they hid. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:17">9:17</a> The Lord shall be known when he executeth judgments: the sinner hath been caught in the works of his own hands. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:18">9:18</a> The wicked shall be turned into hell, all the nations that forget God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:19">9:19</a> For the poor man shall not be forgotten to the end: the patience of the poor shall not perish for ever. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:20">9:20</a> Arise, O Lord, let not man be strengthened: let the Gentiles be judged in thy sight. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:21">9:21</a> Appoint, O Lord, a lawgiver over them: that the Gentiles may know themselves to be but men. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:1">10:1</a> Why, O Lord, hast thou retired afar off? why dost thou slight us in our wants, in the time of trouble? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:2">10:2</a> Whilst the wicked man is proud, the poor is set on fire: they are caught in the counsels which they devise. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:3">10:3</a> For the sinner is praised in the desires of his soul: and the unjust man is blessed. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:4">10:4</a> The sinner hath provoked the Lord according to the multitude of his wrath he will not seek him: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:5">10:5</a> God is not before his eyes: his ways are filthy at all times. Thy judgments are removed from his sight: he shall rule over all his enemies. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:6">10:6</a> For he hath said in his heart: I shall not be moved from generation to generation, and shall be without evil. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:7">10:7</a> His mouth is full of cursing, and of bitterness, and of deceit: under his tongue are labour and sorrow. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:8">10:8</a> He sitteth in ambush with the rich in private places, that he may kill the innocent. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:9">10:9</a> His eyes are upon the poor man: He lieth in wait in secret like a lion in his den. He lieth in ambush that he may catch the poor man: to catch the poor, whilst he draweth him to him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:10">10:10</a> In his net he will bring him down, he will crouch and fall, when he shall have power over the poor. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:11">10:11</a> For he hath said in his heart: God hath forgotten, he hath turned away his face not to see to the end. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:12">10:12</a> Arise, O Lord God, let thy hand be exalted: forget not the poor. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:13">10:13</a> Wherefore hath the wicked provoked God? for he hath said in his heart: He will not require it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:14">10:14</a> Thou seest it, for thou considerest labour and sorrow: that thou mayst deliver them into thy hands. To thee is the poor man left: thou wilt be a helper to the orphan. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:15">10:15</a> Break thou the arm of the sinner and of the malignant: his sin shall be sought, and shall not be found. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:16">10:16</a> The Lord shall reign to eternity, yea, for ever and ever: ye Gentiles shall perish from his land. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:17">10:17</a> The Lord hath heard the desire of the poor: thy ear hath heard the preparation of their heart. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:18">10:18</a> To judge for the fatherless and for the humble, that man may no more presume to magnify himself upon earth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:19">10:19</a> Unto the end. A psalm for David. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:20">10:20</a> In the Lord I put my trust: how then do you say to my soul: Get thee away from hence to the mountain like a sparrow? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:21">10:21</a> For, lo, the wicked have bent their bow; they have prepared their arrows in the quiver; to shoot in the dark the upright of heart. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:22">10:22</a> For they have destroyed the things which thou hast made: but what has the just man done? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:23">10:23</a> The Lord is in his holy temple, the Lord's throne is in heaven. His eyes look on the poor man: his eyelids examine the sons of men. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:24">10:24</a> The Lord trieth the just and the wicked: but he that loveth iniquity hateth his own soul. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:25">10:25</a> He shall rain snares upon sinners: fire and brimstone and storms of winds shall be the portion of their cup. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:26">10:26</a> For the Lord is just, and hath loved justice: his countenance hath beheld righteousness. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:1">11:1</a> Unto the end; for the octave, a psalm for David. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:2">11:2</a> Save me, O Lord, for there is now no saint: truths are decayed from among the children of men. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:3">11:3</a> They have spoken vain things every one to his neighbour: with deceitful lips, and with a double heart have they spoken. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:4">11:4</a> May the Lord destroy all deceitful lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:5">11:5</a> Who have said: We will magnify our tongue; our lips are our own; who is Lord over us? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:6">11:6</a> By reason of the misery of the needy, and the groans of the poor, now will I arise, saith the Lord. I win set him in safety; I will deal confidently in his regard. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:7">11:7</a> The words of the Lord are pure words: as silver tried by the fire, purged from the earth refined seven times. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:8">11:8</a> Thou, O Lord, wilt preserve us.: and keep us from this generation for ever. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:9">11:9</a> The wicked walk round about: according to thy highness, thou best multiplied the children of men. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:1">12:1</a> Unto the end, a psalm for David. How long, O Lord, wilt thou forget me unto the end? how long dost thou turn away thy face from me? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:2">12:2</a> How long shall I take counsels in my soul, sorrow in my heart all the day? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:3">12:3</a> How long shall my enemy be exalted over me? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:4">12:4</a> Consider, and hear me, O Lord my God. Enlighten my eyes that I never sleep in death: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:5">12:5</a> lest at any time my enemy say: I have prevailed against him. They that trouble me will rejoice when I am moved: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:6">12:6</a> but I have trusted in thy mercy. My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation: I will sing to the Lord, who giveth me good things: yea I will sing to the name of the Lord the most high. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:1">13:1</a> Unto the end, a psalm for David. The fool hath said in his heart: There is no God, They are corrupt, and are become abominable in their ways: there is none that doth good, no not one. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:2">13:2</a> The Lord hath looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there be any that understand and seek God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:3">13:3</a> They are all gone aside, they are become unprofitable together: there is none that doth good, no not one. Their throat is an open sepulchre: with their tongues they acted deceitfully; the poison of asps is under their lips. Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness; their feet are swift to shed blood. Destruction and unhappiness in their ways: and the way of peace they have not known: there is no fear of God before their eyes. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:4">13:4</a> Shall not all they know that work iniquity, who devour my people as they eat bread ? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:5">13:5</a> They have not called upon the Lord: there have they trembled for fear, where there was no fear. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:6">13:6</a> For the Lord is in the just generation: you have confounded the counsel of the poor man, but the Lord is his hope. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:7">13:7</a> Who shall give out of Sion the salvation of Israel? when the Lord shall have turned away the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice and Israel shall be glad. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:1">14:1</a> A psalm of David. Lord, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle? or who shall rest in thy holy hill? </p>

 <p><a name="an_71:8">71:8</a> And he shall rule from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_71:9">71:9</a> Before him the Ethiopians shall fall down: and his enemies shall lick the ground. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_71:10">71:10</a> The kings of Tharsis and the islands shall offer presents: the kings of the Arabians and of Saba shall bring gifts: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_71:11">71:11</a> And all kings of the earth shall adore him: all nations shall serve him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_71:12">71:12</a> For he shall deliver the poor from the mighty: and the needy that had no helper. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_71:13">71:13</a> He shall spare the poor and needy: and he shall save the souls of the poor. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_71:14">71:14</a> He shall redeem their souls from usuries and iniquity: and their names shall be honourable in his sight. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_71:15">71:15</a> And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Arabia, for him they shall always adore: they shall bless him all the day. </p>

 <p><a name="an_71:20">71:20</a> The praises of David, the son of Jesse, are ended. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_72:1">72:1</a> A psalm for Asaph. How good is God to Israel, to them that are of a right heart! </p> 
 <p><a name="an_72:2">72:2</a> But my feet were almost moved; my steps had well nigh slipped. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_72:3">72:3</a> Because I had a zeal on occasion of the wicked, seeing the prosperity of sinners. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_72:4">72:4</a> For there is no regard to their death, nor is there strength in their stripes. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_72:5">72:5</a> They are not in the labour of men: neither shall they be scourged like other men.  </p> 
 <p><a name="an_72:6">72:6</a> Therefore pride hath held them fast: they are covered with their iniquity and their wickedness. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_72:7">72:7</a> Their iniquity hath come forth, as it were from fatness: they have passed into the affection of the heart. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_72:8">72:8</a> They have thought and spoken wickedness: they have spoken iniquity on high. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_72:9">72:9</a> They have set their mouth against heaven: and their tongue hath passed through the earth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_72:10">72:10</a> Therefore will my people return here and full days shall be found in them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_72:11">72:11</a> And they said: How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_72:12">72:12</a> Behold these are sinners; and yet abounding in the world they have obtained riches. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_72:13">72:13</a> And I said: Then have I in vain justified my heart, and washed my hands among the innocent. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_72:14">72:14</a> And I have been scourged all the day; and my chastisement hath been in the mornings. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_72:15">72:15</a> If I said: I will speak thus; behold I should condemn the generation of thy children. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_72:16">72:16</a> I studied that I might know this thing, it is a labour in my sight: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_72:17">72:17</a> Until I go into the sanctuary of God, and understand concerning their last ends. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_72:18">72:18</a> But indeed for deceits thou hast put it to them: when they were lifted up thou hast cast them down. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_72:19">72:19</a> How are they brought to desolation? they have suddenly ceased to be: they have perished by reason of their iniquity. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_72:20">72:20</a> As the dream of them that awake, O Lord; so in thy city thou shalt bring their image to nothing. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_72:21">72:21</a> For my heart hath been inflamed, and my reins have been changed: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_72:22">72:22</a> and I am brought to nothing, and I knew not. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_72:23">72:23</a> I am become as a beast before thee: and I am always with thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_72:24">72:24</a> Thou hast held me by my right hand; and by thy will thou hast conducted me, and with thy glory thou hast received me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_72:25">72:25</a> For what have I in heaven? and besides thee what do I desire upon earth? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_72:26">72:26</a> For thee my flesh and my heart hath fainted away: thou art the God of my heart, and the God that is my portion for ever. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_72:27">72:27</a> For behold they that go far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that are disloyal to thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_72:28">72:28</a> But it is good for me to adhere to my God, to put my hope in the Lord God: That I may declare all thy praises, in the gates of the daughter of Sion. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_73:1">73:1</a> Understanding for Asaph. O God, why hast thou cast us off unto the end: why is thy wrath enkindled against the sheep of thy pasture? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_73:2">73:2</a> Remember thy congregation, which thou hast possessed from the beginning. The sceptre of thy inheritance which thou hast redeemed: mount Sion in which thou hast dwelt. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_73:3">73:3</a> Lift up thy hands against their pride unto the end; see what things the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_73:4">73:4</a> And they that hate thee have made their boasts, in the midst of thy solemnity. They have set up their ensigns for signs, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_73:5">73:5</a> and they knew not both in the going out and on the highest top. As with axes in a wood of trees, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_73:6">73:6</a> they have cut down at once the gates thereof, with axe and hatchet they have brought it down. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_73:7">73:7</a> They have set fire to thy sanctuary: they have defiled the dwelling place of thy name on the earth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_73:8">73:8</a> They said in their heart, the whole kindred of them together: Let us abolish all the festival days of God from the land. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_73:9">73:9</a> Our signs we have not seen, there is now no prophet: and he will know us no more. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_73:10">73:10</a> How long, O God, shall the enemy reproach: is the adversary to provoke thy name for ever? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_73:11">73:11</a> Why dost thou turn away thy hand: and thy right hand out of the midst of thy bosom for ever ? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_73:12">73:12</a> But God is our king before ages: he hath wrought salvation in the midst of the earth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_73:13">73:13</a> Thou by thy strength didst make the sea firm: thou didst crush the heads of the dragons in the waters. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_73:14">73:14</a> Thou hast broken the heads of the dragon: thou hast given him to be meat for the people of the Ethiopians. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_73:15">73:15</a> Thou hast broken up the fountains and the torrents: thou hast dried up the Ethan rivers. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_73:16">73:16</a> Thine is the day, and thine is the night: thou hast made the morning light and the sun. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_73:17">73:17</a> Thou hast made all the borders of the earth: the summer and the spring were formed by thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_73:18">73:18</a> Remember this, the enemy hath reproached the Lord: and a foolish people hath provoked thy name. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_73:19">73:19</a> Deliver not up to beasts the souls that confess to thee: and forget not to the end the souls of thy poor. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_73:20">73:20</a> Have regard to thy covenant: for they that are the obscure of the earth have been filled with dwellings of iniquity. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_73:21">73:21</a> Let not the humble be turned away with confusion: the poor and needy shall praise thy name. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_73:22">73:22</a> Arise, O God, judge thy own cause: remember thy reproaches with which the foolish man hath reproached thee all the day. </p>

 <p><a name="an_74:1">74:1</a> Unto the end, corrupt not, a psalm of a canticle for Asaph. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_74:2">74:2</a> We will praise thee, O God: we will praise, and we will call upon thy name. We will relate thy wondrous works: </p>

 <p><a name="an_74:6">74:6</a> Lift not up your horn on high: speak not iniquity against God. </p>

 <p><a name="an_74:9">74:9</a> for in the hand of the Lord there is a cup of strong wine full of mixture. And he hath poured it out from this to that: but the dregs thereof are not emptied: all the sinners of the earth shall drink. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_74:10">74:10</a> But I will declare for ever: I will sing to the God of Jacob. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_74:11">74:11</a> And I will break all the horns of sinners: but the horns of the just shall be exalted. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_75:1">75:1</a> Unto the end, in praises, a psalm for Asaph: a canticle to the Assyrians. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_75:2">75:2</a> In Judea God is known: his name is great in Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_75:3">75:3</a> And his place is in peace: and his abode in Sion: </p>

 <p><a name="an_75:5">75:5</a> Thou enlightenest wonderfully from the everlasting hills. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_75:6">75:6</a> All the foolish of heart were troubled. They have slept their sleep; and all the men of riches have found nothing in their hands. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_75:7">75:7</a> At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, they have all slumbered that mounted on horseback. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_75:8">75:8</a> Thou art terrible, and who shall resist thee? from that time thy wrath. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_75:9">75:9</a> Thou hast caused judgment to be heard from heaven: the earth trembled and was still, </p>

 <p><a name="an_76:1">76:1</a> Unto the end, for Idithun, a psalm of Asaph. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_76:2">76:2</a> I cried to the Lord with my voice; to God with my voice, and he gave ear to me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_76:3">76:3</a> In the day of my trouble I sought God, with my hands lifted up to him in the night, and I was not deceived. My soul refused to be comforted: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_76:4">76:4</a> I remembered God, and was delighted, and was exercised, and my spirit swooned away. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_76:5">76:5</a> My eyes prevented the watches: I was troubled, and I spoke not. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_76:6">76:6</a> I thought upon the days of old: and I had in my mind the eternal years. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_76:7">76:7</a> And I meditated in the night with my own heart: and I was exercised and I swept my spirit. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_76:8">76:8</a> Will God then cast off for ever? or will he never be more favourable again? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_76:9">76:9</a> Or will he cut off his mercy for ever, from generation to generation? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_76:10">76:10</a> Or will God forget to shew mercy? or will he in his anger shut up his mercies? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_76:11">76:11</a> And I said, Now have I begun: this is the change of the right hand of the most High. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_76:12">76:12</a> I remembered the works of the Lord: for I will be mindful of thy wonders from the beginning. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_76:13">76:13</a> And I will meditate on all thy works: and will be employed in thy inventions. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_76:14">76:14</a> Thy way, O God, is in the holy place: who is the great God like our God? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_76:15">76:15</a> Thou art the God that dost wonders. Thou hast made thy power known among the nations: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_76:16">76:16</a> with thy arm thou hast redeemed thy people the children of Jacob and of Joseph. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_76:17">76:17</a> The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee: and they were afraid, and the depths were troubled. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_76:18">76:18</a> Great was the noise of the waters: the clouds sent out a sound. For thy arrows pass: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_76:19">76:19</a> the voice of thy thunder in a wheel. Thy lightnings enlightened the world: the earth shook and trembled. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_76:20">76:20</a> Thy way is in the sea, and thy paths in many waters: and thy footsteps shall not be known. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_76:21">76:21</a> Thou hast conducted thy people like sheep, by the hand of Moses and Aaron </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:1">77:1</a> Understanding for Asaph. Attend, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:2">77:2</a> I will open my mouth in parables: I will utter propositions from the beginning. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:3">77:3</a> How great things have we heard and known, and our fathers have told us. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:4">77:4</a> They have not been hidden from their children, in another generation. Declaring the praises of the Lord, and his powers, and his wonders which he hath done. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:5">77:5</a> And he set up a testimony in Jacob: and made a law in Israel. How great things he commanded our fathers, that they should make the same known to their children: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:6">77:6</a> that another generation might know them. The children that should be born and should rise up, and declare them to their children. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:7">77:7</a> That they may put their hope in God and may not forget the works of God: and may seek his commandments. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:8">77:8</a> That they may not become like their fathers, a perverse end exasperating generation. A generation that set not their heart aright: and whose spirit was not faithful to God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:9">77:9</a> The sons of Ephraim who bend and shoot with the bow: they have turned back in the day of battle. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:10">77:10</a> They kept not the covenant of God: and in his law they would not walk. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:11">77:11</a> And they forgot his benefits, and his wonders that he had shewn them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:12">77:12</a> Wonderful things did he do in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Tanis. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:13">77:13</a> He divided the sea and brought them through: and he made the waters to stand as in a vessel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:14">77:14</a> And he conducted them with a cloud by day: and all the night with a light of </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:15">77:15</a> He struck the rock in the wilderness: and gave them to drink, as out of the great deep. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:16">77:16</a> He brought forth water out of the rock: and made streams run down as rivers. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:17">77:17</a> And they added yet more sin against him: they provoked the most High to wrath in the place without water. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:18">77:18</a> And they tempted God in their hearts, by asking meat for their desires. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:19">77:19</a> And they spoke ill of God: they said: Can God furnish a table in the wilderness? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:20">77:20</a> Because he struck the rock, and the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed. Can he also give bread, or provide a table for his people? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:21">77:21</a> Therefore the Lord heard, and was angry: and a fire was kindled against Jacob, and wrath came up against Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:22">77:22</a> Because they believed not in God: and trusted not in his salvation. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:23">77:23</a> And he had commanded the clouds from above, and had opened the doors of heaven. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:24">77:24</a> And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them the bread of heaven. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:25">77:25</a> Man ate the bread of angels: he sent them provisions in abundance. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:26">77:26</a> He removed the south wind from heaven: and by his power brought in the southwest wind. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:27">77:27</a> And he rained upon them flesh as dust: and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:28">77:28</a> And they fell in the midst of their camp, round about their pavilions. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:29">77:29</a> So they did eat, and were filled exceedingly, and he gave them their desire: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:30">77:30</a> they were not defrauded of that which they craved. As yet their meat was in their mouth: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:31">77:31</a> and the wrath of God came upon them. And he slew the fat ones amongst them, and brought down the chosen men of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:32">77:32</a> In all these things they sinned still: and they believed not for his wondrous works. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:33">77:33</a> And their days were consumed in vanity, and their years in haste. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:34">77:34</a> When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned, and came to him early in the morning. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:35">77:35</a> And they remembered that God was their helper: and the most high God their redeemer. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:36">77:36</a> And they loved him with their mouth: and with their tongue they lied unto him: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:37">77:37</a> But their heart was not right with him: nor were they counted faithful in his covenant. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:38">77:38</a> But he is merciful, and will forgive their sins: and will not destroy them. And many a time did he turn away his anger: and did not kindle all his wrath. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:39">77:39</a> And he remembered that they are flesh: a wind that goeth and returneth not. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:40">77:40</a> How often did they provoke him in the desert: and move him to wrath in the place without water? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:41">77:41</a> And they turned back and tempted God: and grieved the holy one of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:42">77:42</a> They remembered not his hand, in the day that he redeemed them from the hand of him that afflicted them: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:43">77:43</a> How he wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Tanis. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:44">77:44</a> And he turned their rivers into blood, and their showers that they might, not drink. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:45">77:45</a> He sent amongst them divers sores of flies, which devoured them: and frogs which destroyed them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:46">77:46</a> And he gave up their fruits to the blast, and their labours to the locust. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:47">77:47</a> And he destroyed their vineyards with hail, and their mulberry trees with hoarfrost. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:48">77:48</a> And he gave up their cattle to the hail, and their stock to the fire. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:49">77:49</a> And he sent upon them the wrath of his indignation: indignation and wrath and trouble, which he sent by evil angels. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:50">77:50</a> He made a way for a path to his anger: he spared not their souls from death, and their cattle he shut up in death. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:51">77:51</a> And he killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt: the firstfruits of all their labour in the tabernacles of Cham. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:52">77:52</a> And he took away his own people as sheep: and guided them in the wilderness like a flock. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:53">77:53</a> And he brought them out in hope, and they feared not: and the sea overwhelmed their enemies. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:54">77:54</a> And he brought them into the mountain of his sanctuary: the mountain which his right hand had purchased. And he cast out the Gentiles before them: and by lot divided to them their land by a line of distribution. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:55">77:55</a> And he made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tabernacles. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:56">77:56</a> Yet they tempted, and provoked the most high God: and they kept not his testimonies. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:57">77:57</a> And they turned away, and kept not the covenant: even like their fathers they were turned aside as a crooked bow. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:58">77:58</a> They provoked him to anger on their hills: and moved him to jealousy with their graven things. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:59">77:59</a> God heard, and despised them, and he reduced Israel exceedingly as it were to nothing. </p>
