  <h3 align="center">American Standard Version: 2 John</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth; and not I only, but also all they that know the truth;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> for the truth's sake which abideth in us, and it shall be with us for ever:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> Grace, mercy, peace shall be with us, from God the Father, and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> I rejoice greatly that I have found [certain] of thy children walking in truth, even as we received commandment from the Father.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote to thee a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> And this is love, that we should walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, even as ye heard from the beginning, that ye should walk in it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> For many deceivers are gone forth into the world, [even] they that confess not that Jesus Christ cometh in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> Look to yourselves, that ye lose not the things which we have wrought, but that ye receive a full reward.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> Whosoever goeth onward and abideth not in the teaching of Christ, hath not God: he that abideth in the teaching, the same hath both the Father and the Son.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> If any one cometh unto you, and bringeth not this teaching, receive him not into [your] house, and give him no greeting:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> for he that giveth him greeting partaketh in his evil works.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> Having many things to write unto you, I would not [write them] with paper and ink: but I hope to come unto you, and to speak face to face, that your joy may be made full.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> The children of thine elect sister salute thee. </p>
