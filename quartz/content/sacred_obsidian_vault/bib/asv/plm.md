  <h3 align="center">American Standard Version: Philemon</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our beloved and fellow-worker,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> and to Apphia our sister, and to Archippus our fellow-soldier, and to the church in thy house:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> I thank my God always, making mention of thee in my prayers,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> hearing of thy love, and of the faith which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> that the fellowship of thy faith may become effectual, in the knowledge of every good thing which is in you, unto Christ.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> For I had much joy and comfort in thy love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through thee, brother.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> Wherefore, though I have all boldness in Christ to enjoin thee that which is befitting,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> yet for love's sake I rather beseech, being such a one as Paul the aged, and now a prisoner also of Christ Jesus:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> I beseech thee for my child, whom I have begotten in my bonds, Onesimus,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> who once was unprofitable to thee, but now is profitable to thee and to me:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> whom I have sent back to thee in his own person, that is, my very heart:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> whom I would fain have kept with me, that in thy behalf he might minister unto me in the bonds of the gospel:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> but without thy mind I would do nothing; that thy goodness should not be as of necessity, but of free will.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> For perhaps he was therefore parted [from thee] for a season, that thou shouldest have him for ever;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> no longer as a servant, but more than a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much rather to thee, both in the flesh and in the Lord.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> If then thou countest me a partner, receive him as myself.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> But if he hath wronged the at all, or oweth [thee] aught, put that to mine account;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:19">1:19</a> I Paul write it with mine own hand, I will repay it: that I say not unto thee that thou owest to me even thine own self besides.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:20">1:20</a> Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my heart in Christ.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:21">1:21</a> Having confidence in thine obedience I write unto thee, knowing that thou wilt do even beyond what I say.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:22">1:22</a> But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I hope that through your prayers I shall be granted unto you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:23">1:23</a> Epaphras, my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus, saluteth thee;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:24">1:24</a> [and so do] Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow-workers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:25">1:25</a> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen. </p>
