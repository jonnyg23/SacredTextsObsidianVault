 <p align="CENTER">XCVII. <i>The Evils in Store for Sinners and the Possessors of unrighteous Wealth</i>.</p> <h3 align="CENTER">CHAPTER XCVII.</h3><dir> <dir>  
 <p>1. Believe, ye righteous, that the sinners will become a shame<br> And perish in the day of unrighteousness.<br> 2. Be it known unto you (ye sinners) that the Most High is mindful of your destruction,<br> And the angels of heaven rejoice over your destruction.</p> 
 <p>3. What will ye do, ye sinners,<br> And whither will ye flee on that day of judgement,<br> When ye hear the voice of the prayer of the righteous?</p> 
 <p>4. Yea, ye shall fare like unto them,<br> Against whom this word shall be a testimony:<br> "Ye have been companions of sinners."</p> 
 <p>5. And in those days the prayer of the righteous shall reach unto the Lord,<br> And for you the days of your judgement shall come.</p> 
 <p>6. And all the words of your unrighteousness shall be read out before the Great Holy One,<br> And your faces shall be covered with shame,<br> And He will reject every work which is grounded on unrighteousness.</p> 
 <p>7. Woe to you, ye sinners, who live on the mid ocean and on the dry land,<br> Whose remembrance is evil against you.</p> 
 <p>8. Woe to you who acquire silver and gold in unrighteousness and say:<br> "We have become rich with riches and have possessions;<br> And have acquired everything we have desired.<a name="page_139"><font size="1" color="green">p. 139</font></a></p> 
 <p>9. And now let us do what we purposed:<br> For we have gathered silver,<br> 9<sup>d</sup> And many are the husbandmen in our houses."<br> 9<sup>e</sup> And our granaries are (brim) full as with water,</p> 
 <p>10 Yea and like water your lies shall flow away;<br> For your riches shall not abide<br> But speedily ascend from you;</p> 
 <p>For ye have acquired it all in unrighteousness,<br> And ye shall be given over to a great curse.</p>
