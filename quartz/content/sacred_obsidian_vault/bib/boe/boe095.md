 <p>1. 'And now, my son Methuselah, call to me all thy brothers<br> And gather together to me all the sons of thy mother; <a name="page_130"><font size="1" color="green">p. 130</font></a><br> For the word calls me,<br> And the spirit is poured out upon me,<br> That I may show you everything<br> That shall befall you for ever.'</p></dir> </dir>  
 <p>2 And there upon Methuselah went and summoned to him all his brothers and assembled his relatives. 3 And he spake unto all the children of righteousness and said:</p><dir> <dir>  
 <p>'Hear, ye sons of Enoch, all the words of your father,<br> And hearken aright to the voice of my mouth;<br> For I exhort you and say unto you, beloved:</p> 
 <p>Love uprightness and walk therein.<br> 4. And draw not nigh to uprightness with a double heart,<br> And associate not with those of a double heart,<br> But walk in righteousness, my sons.<br> And it shall guide you on good paths,<br> And righteousness shall be your companion.</p> 
 <p>5. For I know that violence <b>must</b> increase on the earth,<br> And a great chastisement be executed on the earth,<br> And all unrighteousness come to an end:</p> 
 <p>Yea, it shall be cut off from its roots,<br> And its whole structure be destroyed.</p> 
 <p>6. And unrighteousness shall again be consummated on the earth,<br> And all the deeds of unrighteousness and of violence<br> And transgression shall prevail in a twofold degree.</p> 
 <p>7. And when sin and unrighteousness and blasphemy<br> And violence in all kinds of deeds increase,<br> And apostasy and transgression and uncleanness increase, <a name="page_131"><font size="1" color="green">p. 131</font></a></p> 
 <p>A great chastisement shall come from heaven upon all these,<br> And the holy Lord will come forth with wrath and chastisement<br> To execute judgement on earth.</p> 
 <p>8. In those days violence shall be cut off from its roots,<br> And the roots of unrighteousness together with deceit,<br> And they shall be destroyed from under heaven.</p> 
 <p>9. And all the idols of the heathen shall be abandoned,<br> And the temples burned with fire,<br> And they shall remove them from the whole earth,</p> 
 <p>And they (<i>i.e.</i> the heathen) shall be cast into the judgement of fire,<br> And shall perish in wrath and in grievous judgement for ever.</p> 
 <p>10. And the righteous shall arise from their sleep,<br> And wisdom shall arise and be given unto them.</p></dir> </dir>  
 <p><font color="GREEN">[</font>11. And after that the roots of unrighteousness shall be cut off, and the sinners shall be destroyed by the sword . . . shall be cut off from the blasphemers in every place, and those who plan violence and those who commit blasphemy shall perish by the sword.<font color="GREEN">]</font></p><dir> <dir>  
 <p>18. And now I tell you, my sons, and show you<br> The paths of righteousness and the paths of violence.<br> Yea, I will show them to you again<br> That ye may know what will come to pass.</p> 
 <p>19. And now, hearken unto me, my sons,<br> And walk in the paths of righteousness,<br> And walk not in the paths of violence;<br> For all who walk in the paths of unrighteousness shall perish for ever.'</p>
