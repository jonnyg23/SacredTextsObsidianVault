 <p>l. For wisdom is poured out like water,<br> And glory faileth not before him for evermore.</p> 
 <p>2. For he is mighty in all the secrets of righteousness,<br> And unrighteousness shall disappear as a shadow,<br> And have no continuance;<br> Because the Elect One standeth before the Lord of Spirits,<br> And his glory is for ever and ever,<br> And his might unto all generations. <a name="page_68"><font size="1" color="green">p. 68</font></a></p> 
 <p>3. And in him dwells the spirit of wisdom,<br> And the spirit which gives insight,<br> And the spirit of understanding and of might,<br> And the spirit of those who have fallen asleep in righteousness.</p> 
 <p>4. And he shall judge the secret things,<br> And none shall be able to utter a lying word before him;<br> For he is the Elect One before the Lord of Spirits according to His good pleasure.</p>
