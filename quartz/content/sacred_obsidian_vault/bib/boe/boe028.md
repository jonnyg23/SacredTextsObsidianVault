 <p>1. And he said unto me: 'Enoch, why dost</p> 
 <p><a name="page_51"><font size="1" color="green">p. 51</font></a></p> 
 <p>thou ask me regarding the fragrance of the tree, and <font color="GREEN">⌈</font>why<font color="GREEN">⌉</font> dost thou wish to learn the truth?' Then I answered him <font color="GREEN">⌈⌈</font>saying<font color="GREEN">⌉⌉</font>: 'I wish to know about everything, but especially about this tree.' And he answered saying: 'This high mountain <font color="GREEN">⌈⌈</font>which thou hast seen<font color="GREEN">⌉⌉</font>, whose summit is like the throne of God, is His throne, where the Holy Great One, the Lord of Glory, the Eternal King, will sit, when He shall come down to visit the earth with goodness. 4. And as for this fragrant tree no mortal is permitted to touch it till the great judgement, when He shall take vengeance on all and bring (everything) to its consummation for ever. It shall then be given to the righteous and holy. 5. Its fruit <b>shall be</b> for food to the elect: it shall be transplanted to the holy place, to the temple of the Lord, the Eternal King.</p><dir> <dir>  
 <p>6 Then shall they rejoice with joy and be glad,<br> And into the holy place shall they enter;<br> And its fragrance shall be in their bones,<br> And they shall live a long life on earth,<br> Such as thy fathers lived:<br> And in their days shall no <font color="GREEN">⌈⌈</font>sorrow or<font color="GREEN">⌉⌉</font> plague<br> Or torment or calamity touch them.'</p></dir> </dir>  
 <p>7 Then blessed I the God of Glory, the Eternal King, who hath prepared such things for the righteous, and hath created them and promised to give to them.</p>
