 <p>1. Then I made a circuit to a place in which nothing was completed.</p>  
 <p>2. And there I beheld neither the tremendous workmanship of an exalted heaven, nor of an established earth, but a desolate spot, prepared, and terrific.</p>  
 <p>3. There, too, I beheld seven stars of heaven bound in it together, like great mountains, and like a blazing fire. I exclaimed, For what species of crime have they been bound, and why have they been removed to this place? Then Uriel, one of the holy angels who was with me, and who conducted me, answered: Enoch, wherefore dost thou ask; wherefore reason with thyself, and anxiously inquire? These are those of the stars which have transgressed the commandment of the most high God; and are here bound, until the infinite number of the days of their crimes be completed.</p>  
 <p>4. From thence I afterwards passed on to another terrific place;</p>  
 <p>5. Where I beheld the operation of a great fire blazing and glittering, in the midst of which there</p>  
 <p><a name="page_28"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 28</font></a></p>  
 <p>was a division. Columns of fire struggled together to the end of the abyss, and deep was their descent. But neither its measurement nor magnitude was I able to discover; neither could I perceive its origin. Then I exclaimed, How terrible is this place, and how difficult to explore!</p>  
 <p>6. Uriel, one of the holy angels who was with me, answered and said: Enoch, why art thou alarmed and amazed at this terrific place, at the sight of this <i>place of</i> suffering? This, he said, is the prison of the angels; and here they are kept for ever.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXII">XXII</a></font></span></p>  <h3 align="center">CHAP. XXII. [SECT. V. <a name="fr_66"></a><a href="#fn_65"><font size="1">1</font></a>]</h3>  
 <p>1. From thence I proceeded to another spot, where I saw on the west a great and lofty mountain, a strong rock, and four delightful places.</p>  
 <p>2. Internally it was deep, capacious, and very smooth; as smooth as if it had been rolled over: it was both deep and dark to behold.</p>  
 <p>3. Then Raphael, one of the holy angels who were with me, answered and said, These are the delightful places where the spirits, the souls of the dead, will be collected; for them were they formed; and here will be collected all the souls of the sons of men.</p>  
 <p>4. These places, in which they dwell, shall they</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_29"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 29</font></a></p>  
 <p>occupy until the day of judgment, and until their appointed period.</p>  
 <p>5. Their appointed period will be long, even until the great judgment. And I saw the spirits of the sons of men who were dead; and their voices reached to heaven, while they were accusing. <a name="fr_67"></a><a href="#fn_66"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>6. Then I inquired of Raphael, an angel who was with me, and said, Whose spirit is that, the voice of which reaches <i>to heaven</i>, and accuses?</p>  
 <p>7. He answered, saying, This is the spirit of Abel, who was slain by Cain his brother; and who will accuse that brother, <a name="fr_68"></a><a href="#fn_67"><font size="1">2</font></a> until his seed be destroyed from the face of the earth;</p>  
 <p>8. Until his seed perish from the seed of the human race.</p>  
 <p>9. At that time therefore I inquired respecting him, and respecting the general judgment, saying, Why is one separated from another? He answered, Three <i>separations</i> have been made between the spirits of the dead, and thus have the spirits of the righteous been separated.</p>  
 <p>10. Namely, <i>by</i> a chasm, <i>by</i> water, and <i>by</i> light above it.</p>  
 <p>11. And in the same way likewise are sinners separated when they die, and are buried in the earth; judgment not overtaking them in their lifetime.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_30"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 30</font></a></p>  
 <p>12. Here their souls are separated. Moreover, abundant is their suffering until the time of the great judgment, the castigation, and the torment of those who eternally execrate, whose souls are punished and bound there for ever.</p>  
 <p>13. And thus has it been front the beginning of the world. Thus has there existed a separation between the souls of those who utter complaints, and of those who watch for their destruction, to slaughter them in the day of sinners.</p>  
 <p>14. A receptacle of this sort has been formed <a name="fr_69"></a><a href="#fn_68"><font size="1">1</font></a> for the souls of unrighteous men, and of sinners; of those who have completed crime, and associated with the impious, whom they resemble. Their souls shall not be annihilated in the day of judgment, neither shall they arise from this place. Then I blessed God,</p>  
 <p>15. And said, Blessed be my Lord, the Lord of glory and of righteousness, who reigns over all for ever and for ever.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXIII">XXIII</a></font></span></p>  <h3 align="center">CHAP. XXIII.</h3>  
 <p>1. From thence I went to another place, towards the west, unto the extremities of the earth.</p>  
 <p>2. Where I beheld a fire blazing and running along without cessation, which intermitted its course</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_31"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 31</font></a></p>  
 <p>neither by day nor by night; but continued always the same.</p>  
 <p>3. I inquired, saying, What is this, which never ceases?</p>  
 <p>4. Then Raguel, one of the holy angels who were with me, answered,</p>  
 <p>5. And said, This blazing fire, which thou beholdest running towards the west, is <i>that of</i> all the luminaries of heaven.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXIV">XXIV</a></font></span></p>  <h3 align="center">CHAP. XXIV.</h3>  
 <p>1. I went from thence to another place, and saw a mountain of fire flashing both by day and night. I proceeded towards it; and perceived seven splendid mountains, which were all different from each other.</p>  
 <p>2. Their stones were brilliant and beautiful; all were brilliant and splendid to behold; and beautiful was their surface. Three <i>mountains</i> were towards the east, and strengthened by being placed one upon another; and three were towards the south, strengthened in a similar manner. There were likewise deep valleys, which did not approach each other. And the seventh mountain was in the midst of them. In length they all resembled the seat of a throne, and odoriferous trees surrounded them.</p>  
 <p>3. Among these there was a tree of an unceasing</p>  
 <p><a name="page_32"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 32</font></a></p>  
 <p>smell; nor of those which were in Eden was there one of all the fragrant trees which smelt like this. Its leaf, its flower, and its bark never withered, and its fruit was beautiful.</p>  
 <p>4. Its fruit resembled the cluster of the palm. I exclaimed, Behold! this tree is goodly in aspect, pleasing in its leaf, and the sight of its fruit is delightful to the eye. Then Michael, one of the holy and glorious angels who were with me, and one who presided over them, answered,</p>  
 <p>5. And said: Enoch, why dost thou inquire respecting the odour of this tree?</p>  
 <p>6. <i>Why</i> art thou inquisitive to know it?</p>  
 <p>7. Then I, Enoch, replied to him, and said, Concerning everything I am desirous of instruction, but particularly concerning this tree.</p>  
 <p>8. He answered me, saying, That mountain which thou beholdest, the extent of whose head resembles the seat of the Lord, will be the seat on which shall sit the holy and great Lord of glory, the everlasting King, when he shall come and descend to visit the earth with goodness.</p>  
 <p>9. And that tree of an agreeable smell, not one of carnal <i>odour</i>, <a name="fr_70"></a><a href="#fn_69"><font size="1">1</font></a> there shall be no power to touch, until the period of the great judgment. When all shall be punished and consumed for ever, this shall be bestowed on the righteous and humble. The fruit</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_33"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 33</font></a></p>  
 <p>of this <i>tree</i> shall be given to the elect. For towards the north life shall be planted in the holy place, towards the habitation of the everlasting King.</p>  
 <p>10. Then shall they greatly rejoice and exult in the Holy One. The sweet odour shall enter into their bones; and they shall live a long life on the earth, as thy forefathers have lived; neither in their days shall sorrow, distress, trouble, and punishment afflict them.</p>  
 <p>11. And I blessed the Lord of glory, the everlasting King, because He has prepared <i>this tree</i> for the saints, formed it, and declared that He would give it to them.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXV">XXV</a></font></span></p>  <h3 align="center">CHAP. XXV.</h3>  
 <p>1. From thence I proceeded to the middle of the earth, and beheld a happy and fertile spot, which contained branches continually sprouting from the trees which were planted in it. There I saw a holy mountain, and underneath it water on the eastern side, which flowed towards the south. I saw also on the east another mountain as high as that; and between them there were deep, but not wide valleys.</p>  
 <p>2. Water ran towards the mountain to the west of this; and underneath there was likewise another mountain.</p>  
 <p>3. There was a valley, but not a wide one, below it; and in the midst of them were other deep and</p>  
 <p><a name="page_34"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 34</font></a></p>  
 <p>dry valleys towards the extremity of the three. All these valleys, which were deep, but not wide, consisted of a strong rock, with a tree which was planted in them. And I wondered at the rock and at the valleys, being extremely surprised.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXVI">XXVI</a></font></span></p>  <h3 align="center">CHAP. XXVI.</h3>  
 <p>1. Then I said, What means this blessed land, all these lofty trees, and the accursed valley between them?</p>  
 <p>2. Then Uriel, one of the holy angels who were with me, replied, This valley is the accursed of the accursed for ever. Here shall be collected all who utter with their mouths unbecoming language against God, and speak harsh things of His glory. Here shall they be collected. Here shall be their territory.</p>  
 <p>3. In the latter days an example of judgment shall be made of them in righteousness before the saints: while those who have received mercy shall for ever, all their days, bless God, the everlasting King.</p>  
 <p>4. And at the period of judgment shall they bless Him for his mercy, as He has distributed it to them. Then I blessed God, addressing myself to Him, and making mention, as was meet, of His greatness.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_35"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 35</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXVII">XXVII</a></font></span></p>  <h3 align="center">CHAP. XXVII.</h3>  
 <p>1. From thence I proceeded towards the east, to the middle of the mountain in the desert, the level surface only of which I perceived.</p>  
 <p>2. It was full of trees of the seed alluded to; and water leaped down upon it.</p>  
 <p>3. There appeared a cataract composed as of many cataracts both towards the west and towards the east. Upon one side were trees; upon the other water and dew.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXVIII">XXVIII</a></font></span></p>  <h3 align="center">CHAP. XXVIII.</h3>  
 <p>1. Then I went to another place from the desert, towards the east of that mountain <i>which</i> I had approached.</p>  
 <p>2. There I beheld choice trees, particularly <i>those which produce</i> the sweet-smelling drugs, frankincense and myrrh; <a name="fr_71"></a><a href="#fn_70"><font size="1">1</font></a> and trees unlike to each other.</p>  
 <p>3. And over it, above them, was the elevation of the eastern mountain at no great distance.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXIX">XXIX</a></font></span></p>  <h3 align="center">CHAP. XXIX.</h3>  
 <p>1. I likewise saw another place with valleys of water which never wasted,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_36"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 36</font></a></p>  
 <p>2. <i>Where</i> I perceived a goodly tree, which in smell resembled Zasakinon.</p>  
 <p>3. And towards the sides of these valleys I perceived cinnamon of a sweet odour. Over them I advanced towards the east.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXX">XXX</a></font></span></p>  <h3 align="center">CHAP. XXX.</h3>  
 <p>1. Then I beheld another mountain containing trees, from which water flowed like Neketro. Its name was Sarira, and Kalboneba. And upon this mountain I beheld another mountain, upon which were trees of Alva.</p>  
 <p>2. These trees were full, like almond trees, anal strong; and when they produced fruit, it was superior to all perfume.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXXI">XXXI</a></font></span></p>  <h3 align="center">CHAP. XXXI.</h3>  
 <p>1. After these things, surveying the entrances of the north, above the mountains, I perceived seven mountains replete with pure nard, odoriferous trees, cinnamon and papyrus.</p>  
 <p>2. From thence I passed on above the summits of those mountains to some distance eastwards, and went over the Erythræan sea. And when I was advanced far beyond it, I passed along above the angel Zateel, and arrived at the garden of righteousness.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_37"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 37</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> In this garden I beheld, among other trees, some which were numerous and large, and which flourished there.</p>  
 <p>3. Their fragrance was agreeable and powerful, <a name="fr_72"></a><a href="#fn_71"><font size="1">1</font></a> and their appearance both varied and elegant. The tree of knowledge also was there, of which if any one eats, he becomes endowed with great wisdom.</p>  
 <p>4. It was like a species of the tamarind tree, bearing fruit which resembled grapes extremely fine; and its fragrance extended to a considerable distance. I exclaimed, How beautiful is this tree, and how delightful is its appearance!</p>  
 <p>5. Then holy Raphael, an angel who was with me, answered and said, This is the tree of knowledge, of which thy ancient father and thy aged mother ate, who were before thee; and who, obtaining knowledge, their eyes being opened, and knowing themselves to be naked, were expelled from the garden.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXXII">XXXII</a></font></span></p>  <h3 align="center">CHAP. XXXII.</h3>  
 <p>1. From thence I went on towards the extremities of the earth; where I saw large beasts different from each other, and birds various in their countenances and forms, as well as with notes of different sounds.</p>  
 <p>2. To the east of these beasts I perceived the</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_38"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 38</font></a></p>  
 <p>extremities of the earth, where heaven ceased. The gates of heaven stood open, and I beheld the celestial stars come forth. I numbered them as they proceeded out of the gate, and wrote them all down, as they came out one by one according to their number. <i>I wrote down</i> their names altogether, their times and their seasons, as the angel Uriel, who was with me, pointed them out to me.</p>  
 <p>3. He showed them all to me, and wrote down <i>an account of</i> them.</p>  
 <p>4. He also wrote down for me their names, their regulations, and their operations.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXXIII">XXXIII</a></font></span></p>  <h3 align="center">CHAP. XXXIII.</h3>  
 <p>1. From thence I advanced on towards the north, to the extremities of the earth.</p>  
 <p>2. And there I saw a great and glorious wonder at the extremities of the whole earth.</p>  
 <p>3. I saw there heavenly gates opening into heaven; three of them distinctly separated. The northern winds proceeded from them, blowing cold, hail, frost, snow, dew, and rain.</p>  
 <p>4. From one of the gates they blew mildly; but when they blew from the two <i>other gates</i>, it was with violence and force. They blew over the earth strongly.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_39"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 39</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXXIV">XXXIV</a></font></span></p>  <h3 align="center">CHAP. XXXIV.</h3>  
 <p>1. From thence I went to the extremities of the world westwards;</p>  
 <p>2. Where I perceived three gates open, as I had seen in the north; the gates and passages through them being of equal magnitude.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXXV">XXXV</a></font></span></p>  <h3 align="center">CHAP. XXXV.</h3>  
 <p>1. Then I proceeded to the extremities of the earth southwards; where I saw three gates open to the south, from which issued dew, rain, and wind.</p>  
 <p>2. From thence I went to the extremities of heaven eastwards; where I saw three heavenly gates open to the east, which had smaller gates within them. Through each of these small gates the stars of heaven passed on, and proceeded towards the west by a path which was seen by them, and that at every period <i>of their appearance</i>.</p>  
 <p>3. When I beheld <i>them</i>, I blessed; every time <i>in which they appeared</i>, I blessed the Lord of glory, who had made those great and splendid signs, that they might display the magnificence of his works to angels and to the souls of men; and that these might glorify all his works and operations; might see the effect of his power; might glorify the great labour of his hands; and bless him for ever.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_40"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 40</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXXVII">XXXVII</a></font></span></p>  <h3 align="center">CHAP. XXXVII. <a name="fr_73"></a><a href="#fn_72"><font size="1">1</font></a> [SECT. VI. <a name="fr_74"></a><a href="#fn_73"><font size="1">2</font></a>]</h3>  
 <p>1. The vision which he saw, the second vision of wisdom, which Enoch saw, the son of Jared, the son of Malaleel, the son of Canan, the son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son of Adam. This is the commencement of the word of wisdom, which I received to declare and tell to those who dwell upon earth. Hear from the beginning, and understand to the end, the holy things which I utter in the presence of the Lord of spirits. Those who were before <i>us</i> thought it good to speak;</p>  
 <p>2. And let not us, who come after, obstruct the beginning of wisdom. Until the present period never has there been given before the Lord of spirits that which I have received, wisdom according to the capacity of my intellect, <a name="fr_75"></a><a href="#fn_74"><font size="1">3</font></a> and according to the pleasure of the Lord of spirits; that which I have received from him, <a name="fr_76"></a><a href="#fn_75"><font size="1">4</font></a> a portion of life eternal.</p>  
 <p>3. And I obtained three parables, which I declared to the inhabitants of the world.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_41"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 41</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXXVIII">XXXVIII</a></font></span></p>  <h3 align="center">CHAP. XXXVIII.</h3>  
 <p>1. Parable the first. When the congregation of the righteous shall be manifested; and sinners be judged for their crimes, and be troubled in the sight of the world;</p>  
 <p>2. When righteousness shall be manifested in the presence of the righteous themselves, who will be elected for their <i>good</i> works <i>duly</i> weighed by the Lord of spirits; and when the light of the righteous and the elect, who dwell on earth, shall be manifested; where will the habitation of sinners be? and where the place of rest for those who have rejected the Lord of spirits? It would have been better for them, had they never been born.</p>  
 <p>3. When, too, the secrets of the righteous shall be revealed, then shall sinners be judged; and impious men shall be afflicted in the presence of the righteous and the elect.</p>  
 <p>4. From that period those who possess the earth shall cease to be <a name="fr_77"></a><a href="#fn_76"><font size="1">1</font></a> powerful and exalted. Neither shall they be capable of beholding the countenances of the holy; for the light of the countenances of the holy, the righteous, and the elect, has been seen by the Lord of spirits.</p>  
 <p>5. Yet shall not the mighty kings of that period</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_42"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 42</font></a></p>  
 <p>be destroyed; but be delivered into the hands of the righteous and the holy.</p>  
 <p>6. Nor thenceforwards shall any obtain commiseration from the Lord of spirits, because their lives <i>in this world</i> will have been completed.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXXIX">XXXIX</a></font></span></p>  <h3 align="center">CHAP. XXXIX.</h3>  
 <p>1. In those days shall the elect and holy race descend from the upper heavens, and their seed shall then be with the sons of men. Enoch received books of indignation and wrath, and books of hurry and agitation.</p>  
 <p>2. Never shall they obtain mercy, saith the Lord of spirits.</p>  
 <p>3. A cloud then snatched me up, and the wind raised me above the surface of the earth, placing me at the extremity of the heavens.</p>  
 <p>4. There I saw another vision; I <i>saw</i> the habitations and couches of the saints. There my eyes beheld their habitations with the angels, and their couches with the holy ones. They were entreating, supplicating, and praying for the sons of men; while righteousness like water flowed before them, and mercy like dew <i>was scattered</i> over the earth. And thus <i>shall it be</i> with them for ever and for ever.</p>  
 <p>5. At that time my eyes beheld the dwelling <a name="fr_78"></a><a href="#fn_77"><font size="1">1</font></a> of the elect, of truth, faith, and righteousness.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_43"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 43</font></a></p>  
 <p>6. Countless shall be the number of the holy and the elect, in the presence of God <a name="fr_79"></a><a href="#fn_78"><font size="1">1</font></a> for ever and for ever.</p>  
 <p>7. Their residence I beheld under the wings of the Lord of spirits. All the holy and the elect sung before him, in appearance like a blaze of fire; their mouths being full of blessings, and their lips glorifying the name of the Lord of spirits. And righteousness incessantly <i>dwelt</i> before him,</p>  
 <p>8. There was I desirous of remaining, and my soul longed for that habitation. There was my antecedent inheritance; for thus had I prevailed <a name="fr_80"></a><a href="#fn_79"><font size="1">2</font></a> before the Lord of spirits.</p>  
 <p>9. At that time I glorified and extolled the name of the Lord of spirits with blessing and with praise; for he has established it with blessing and with praise, according to his own good pleasure. <a name="fr_81"></a><a href="#fn_80"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>  
 <p>10. That place long did my eyes contemplate. I blessed and said, Blessed be he, blessed from the beginning for ever. In the beginning, before the world was created, and without end is his knowledge. <a name="fr_82"></a><a href="#fn_81"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>  
 <p>11. What is this world? Of every existing generation those shall bless thee who do not sleep <i>in the</i></p>

 <p><a name="page_44"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 44</font></a></p>  
 <p><i>dust</i>, but stand before thy glory, blessing, glorifying, exalting thee, and saying, The holy, holy, Lord of spirits, fills the whole world of spirits.</p>  
 <p>12. There my eyes beheld all who, without sleeping, stand before him and bless him, saying, Blessed be thou, and blessed be the name of God for ever and for ever. Then my countenance became changed, until I was incapable of seeing.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XL">XL</a></font></span></p>  <h3 align="center">CHAP. XL.</h3>  
 <p>1. After this I beheld thousands of thousands, and myriads of myriads, and an infinite number of people, standing before the Lord of spirits.</p>  
 <p>2. On the four wings likewise of the Lord of spirits, on the four sides, I perceived others, besides those who were standing <i>before him</i>. Their names, too, I know; because the angel, who proceeded with me, declared them to me, discovering to me every secret thing.</p>  
 <p>3. Then I heard the voices of those upon the four sides magnifying the Lord of glory.</p>  
 <p>4. The first voice blessed the Lord of spirits for ever and for ever.</p>  
 <p>5. The second voice I heard blessing the elect One, and the elect who suffer <a name="fr_83"></a><a href="#fn_82"><font size="1">1</font></a> on account of the Lords of spirits.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_45"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 45</font></a></p>  
 <p>6. The third voice I heard petitioning and praying for those who dwell upon earth, and supplicate the name of the Lord of spirits.</p>  
 <p>7. The fourth voice I heard expelling the impious angels, <a name="fr_84"></a><a href="#fn_83"><font size="1">1</font></a> and prohibiting them from entering into presence of the Lord of spirits, to prefer accusations against the inhabitants of the earth.</p>  
 <p>8. After this I besought the angel of peace, who proceeded with me, to explain all that was concealed. I said to him, Who are those <i>whom</i> I have seen on the four sides, and whose words I have heard and written down? He replied, The first is the merciful, the patient, the holy Michael.</p>  
 <p>9. The second is he who <i>presides</i> over every suffering and every affliction <a name="fr_85"></a><a href="#fn_84"><font size="1">2</font></a> of the sons of men, the holy Raphael. The third, who <i>presides</i> over all that is powerful, is Gabriel. And the fourth, who <i>presides</i> over repentance, and the hope of those who will inherit eternal life, is Phanuel. These are the four angels of the most high God, and their four voices, which at that time I heard.</p>
