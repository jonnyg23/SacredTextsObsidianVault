 <p><a name="an_10:1">10:1</a> Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain on Mount Gilboa.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:2">10:2</a> The Philistines followed hard after Saul and after his sons; and the Philistines killed Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:3">10:3</a> The battle went hard against Saul, and the archers overtook him; and he was distressed by reason of the archers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:4">10:4</a> Then Saul said to his armor bearer, "Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me." But his armor bearer would not; for he was terrified. Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell on it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:5">10:5</a> When his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell on his sword, and died.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:6">10:6</a> So Saul died, and his three sons; and all his house died together.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:7">10:7</a> When all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook their cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and lived in them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:8">10:8</a> It happened on the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:9">10:9</a> They stripped him, and took his head, and his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines all around, to carry the news to their idols, and to the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:10">10:10</a> They put his armor in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the house of Dagon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:11">10:11</a> When all Jabesh Gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:12">10:12</a> all the valiant men arose, and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:13">10:13</a> So Saul died for his trespass which he committed against Yahweh, because of the word of Yahweh, which he didn't keep; and also because he asked counsel of one who had a familiar spirit, to inquire [thereby],</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:14">10:14</a> and didn't inquire of Yahweh: therefore he killed him, and turned the kingdom to David the son of Jesse.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:1">11:1</a> Then all Israel gathered themselves to David to Hebron, saying, "Behold, we are your bone and your flesh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:2">11:2</a> In times past, even when Saul was king, it was you who led out and brought in Israel. Yahweh your God said to you, 'You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall be prince over my people Israel.'"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:3">11:3</a> So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Yahweh; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of Yahweh by Samuel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:4">11:4</a> David and all Israel went to Jerusalem (the same is Jebus); and the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, were there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:5">11:5</a> The inhabitants of Jebus said to David, "You shall not come in here." Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion. The same is the city of David.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:6">11:6</a> David said, "Whoever strikes the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain." Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, and was made chief.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:7">11:7</a> David lived in the stronghold; therefore they called it the city of David.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:8">11:8</a> He built the city all around, from Millo even around; and Joab repaired the rest of the city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:9">11:9</a> David grew greater and greater; for Yahweh of Armies was with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:10">11:10</a> Now these are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who showed themselves strong with him in his kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of Yahweh concerning Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:11">11:11</a> This is the number of the mighty men whom David had: Jashobeam, the son of a Hachmonite, the chief of the thirty; he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them at one time.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:12">11:12</a> After him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:13">11:13</a> He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where there was a plot of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:14">11:14</a> They stood in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and killed the Philistines; and Yahweh saved them by a great victory.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:15">11:15</a> Three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the army of the Philistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:16">11:16</a> David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:17">11:17</a> David longed, and said, "Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:18">11:18</a> The three broke through the army of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but David would not drink of it, but poured it out to Yahweh,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:19">11:19</a> and said, "My God forbid it me, that I should do this! Shall I drink the blood of these men who have put their lives in jeopardy?" For they risked their lives to bring it. Therefore he would not drink it. The three mighty men did these things.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:20">11:20</a> Abishai, the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three; for he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them, and had a name among the three.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:21">11:21</a> Of the three, he was more honorable than the two, and was made their captain: however he didn't attain to the [first] three.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:22">11:22</a> Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, he killed the two [sons of] Ariel of Moab: he went down also and killed a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:23">11:23</a> He killed an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian's hand was a spear like a weaver's beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and killed him with his own spear.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:24">11:24</a> These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had a name among the three mighty men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:25">11:25</a> Behold, he was more honorable than the thirty, but he didn't attain to the [first] three: and David set him over his guard.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:26">11:26</a> Also the mighty men of the armies: Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,</p>

 <p><a name="an_12:15">12:15</a> These are those who went over the Jordan in the first month, when it had overflowed all its banks; and they put to flight all them of the valleys, both toward the east, and toward the west.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:16">12:16</a> There came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the stronghold to David.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:17">12:17</a> David went out to meet them, and answered them, "If you have come peaceably to me to help me, my heart shall be knit to you; but if you have come to betray me to my adversaries, since there is no wrong in my hands, may the God of our fathers look thereon, and rebuke it."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:18">12:18</a> Then the Spirit came on Amasai, who was chief of the thirty, [and he said], "We are yours, David, and on your side, you son of Jesse: peace, peace be to you, and peace be to your helpers; for your God helps you." Then David received them, and made them captains of the band.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:19">12:19</a> Of Manasseh also there fell away some to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle; but they didn't help them; for the lords of the Philistines sent him away after consultation, saying, "He will fall away to his master Saul to the jeopardy of our heads."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:20">12:20</a> As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zillethai, captains of thousands who were of Manasseh.</p>

 <p><a name="an_12:32">12:32</a> Of the children of Issachar, men who had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do, the heads of them were two hundred; and all their brothers were at their commandment.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:33">12:33</a> Of Zebulun, such as were able to go out in the army, who could set the battle in array, with all kinds of instruments of war, fifty thousand, and who could order [the battle array, and were] not of double heart.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:34">12:34</a> Of Naphtali one thousand captains, and with them with shield and spear thirty-seven thousand.</p>

 <p><a name="an_12:36">12:36</a> Of Asher, such as were able to go out in the army, who could set the battle in array, forty thousand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:37">12:37</a> On the other side of the Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and of the half-tribe of Manasseh, with all kinds of instruments of war for the battle, one hundred twenty thousand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:38">12:38</a> All these being men of war, who could order the battle array, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel: and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:39">12:39</a> They were there with David three days, eating and drinking; for their brothers had made preparation for them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:40">12:40</a> Moreover those who were near to them, [even] as far as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on donkeys, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, food of meal, cakes of figs, and clusters of raisins, and wine, and oil, and cattle, and sheep in abundance: for there was joy in Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:1">13:1</a> David consulted with the captains of thousands and of hundreds, even with every leader.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:2">13:2</a> David said to all the assembly of Israel, "If it seems good to you, and if it is of Yahweh our God, let us send abroad everywhere to our brothers who are left in all the land of Israel, with whom the priests and Levites are in their cities that have suburbs, that they may gather themselves to us;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:3">13:3</a> and let us bring again the ark of our God to us. For we didn't seek it in the days of Saul."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:4">13:4</a> All the assembly said that they would do so; for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:5">13:5</a> So David assembled all Israel together, from the Shihor [the brook] of Egypt even to the entrance of Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath Jearim.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:6">13:6</a> David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, [that is], to Kiriath Jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God Yahweh that sits [above] the cherubim, that is called by the Name.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:7">13:7</a> They carried the ark of God on a new cart, [and brought it] out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:8">13:8</a> David and all Israel played before God with all their might, even with songs, and with harps, and with stringed instruments, and with tambourines, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:9">13:9</a> When they came to the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:10">13:10</a> The anger of Yahweh was kindled against Uzza, and he struck him, because he put forth his hand to the ark; and there he died before God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:11">13:11</a> David was displeased, because Yahweh had broken forth on Uzza; and he called that place Perez Uzza, to this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:12">13:12</a> David was afraid of God that day, saying, "How shall I bring the ark of God home to me?"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:13">13:13</a> So David didn't move the ark to him into the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:14">13:14</a> The ark of God remained with the family of Obed-Edom in his house three months: and Yahweh blessed the house of Obed-Edom, and all that he had.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:1">14:1</a> Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and masons, and carpenters, to build him a house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:2">14:2</a> David perceived that Yahweh had established him king over Israel; for his kingdom was exalted on high, for his people Israel's sake.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:3">14:3</a> David took more wives at Jerusalem; and David became the father of more sons and daughters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:4">14:4</a> These are the names of the children whom he had in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:5">14:5</a> and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpelet,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:6">14:6</a> and Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:7">14:7</a> and Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphelet.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:8">14:8</a> When the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David: and David heard of it, and went out against them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:9">14:9</a> Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:10">14:10</a> David inquired of God, saying, "Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will you deliver them into my hand?" Yahweh said to him, "Go up; for I will deliver them into your hand."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:11">14:11</a> So they came up to Baal Perazim, and David struck them there; and David said, God has broken my enemies by my hand, like the breach of waters. Therefore they called the name of that place Baal Perazim.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:12">14:12</a> They left their gods there; and David gave commandment, and they were burned with fire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:13">14:13</a> The Philistines yet again made a raid in the valley.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:14">14:14</a> David inquired again of God; and God said to him, "You shall not go up after them. Turn away from them, and come on them over against the mulberry trees.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:15">14:15</a> It shall be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then you shall go out to battle; for God has gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:16">14:16</a> David did as God commanded him: and they struck the army of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:17">14:17</a> The fame of David went out into all lands; and Yahweh brought the fear of him on all nations.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:1">15:1</a> [David] made him houses in the city of David; and he prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:2">15:2</a> Then David said, "No one ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites. For Yahweh has chosen them to carry the ark of God, and to minister to him forever."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:3">15:3</a> David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of Yahweh to its place, which he had prepared for it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:4">15:4</a> David gathered together the sons of Aaron, and the Levites:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:5">15:5</a> of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, and his brothers one hundred twenty;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:6">15:6</a> of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, and his brothers two hundred twenty;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:7">15:7</a> of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief, and his brothers one hundred thirty;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:8">15:8</a> of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief, and his brothers two hundred;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:9">15:9</a> of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief, and his brothers eighty;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:10">15:10</a> of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, and his brothers one hundred twelve.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:11">15:11</a> David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:12">15:12</a> and said to them, "You are the heads of the fathers' [houses] of the Levites. Sanctify yourselves, both you and your brothers, that you may bring up the ark of Yahweh, the God of Israel, to the place that I have prepared for it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:13">15:13</a> For because you didn't carry it at first, Yahweh our God made broke out against us, because we didn't seek him according to the ordinance."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:14">15:14</a> So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of Yahweh, the God of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:15">15:15</a> The children of the Levites bore the ark of God on their shoulders with the poles thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of Yahweh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:16">15:16</a> David spoke to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brothers the singers, with instruments of music, stringed instruments and harps and cymbals, sounding aloud and lifting up the voice with joy.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:17">15:17</a> So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brothers, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brothers, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:18">15:18</a> and with them their brothers of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, the doorkeepers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:19">15:19</a> So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, [were appointed] with cymbals of brass to sound aloud;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:20">15:20</a> and Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with stringed instruments set to Alamoth;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:21">15:21</a> and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps tuned to the eight-stringed lyre, to lead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:22">15:22</a> Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was over the song: he instructed about the song, because he was skillful.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:23">15:23</a> Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:24">15:24</a> Shebaniah, and Joshaphat, and Nethanel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obed-Edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:25">15:25</a> So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh out of the house of Obed-Edom with joy.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:26">15:26</a> It happened, when God helped the Levites who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, that they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:27">15:27</a> David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites who bore the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song [with] the singers: and David had on him an ephod of linen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:28">15:28</a> Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, sounding aloud with stringed instruments and harps.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:29">15:29</a> It happened, as the ark of the covenant of Yahweh came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window, and saw king David dancing and playing; and she despised him in her heart.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:1">16:1</a> They brought in the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:2">16:2</a> When David had made an end of offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Yahweh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:3">16:3</a> He dealt to everyone of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a portion [of flesh], and a cake of raisins.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:4">16:4</a> He appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of Yahweh, and to celebrate and to thank and praise Yahweh, the God of Israel:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:5">16:5</a> Asaph the chief, and second to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, with stringed instruments and with harps; and Asaph with cymbals, sounding aloud;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:6">16:6</a> and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually, before the ark of the covenant of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:7">16:7</a> Then on that day David first ordained to give thanks to Yahweh, by the hand of Asaph and his brothers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:8">16:8</a> Oh give thanks to Yahweh. Call on his name. Make his doings known among the peoples.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:9">16:9</a> Sing to him. Sing praises to him. Tell of all his marvelous works.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:10">16:10</a> Glory in his holy name. Let the heart of those who seek Yahweh rejoice.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:11">16:11</a> Seek Yahweh and his strength. Seek his face forever more.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:12">16:12</a> Remember his marvelous works that he has done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:13">16:13</a> you seed of Israel his servant, you children of Jacob, his chosen ones.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:14">16:14</a> He is Yahweh our God. His judgments are in all the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:15">16:15</a> Remember his covenant forever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:16">16:16</a> [the covenant] which he made with Abraham, his oath to Isaac.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:17">16:17</a> He confirmed the same to Jacob for a statute, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:18">16:18</a> saying, "I will give you the land of Canaan, The lot of your inheritance,"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:19">16:19</a> when you were but a few men in number, yes, very few, and foreigners were in it.</p>

 <p><a name="an_16:21">16:21</a> He allowed no man to do them wrong. Yes, he reproved kings for their sakes,</p>

 <p><a name="an_16:23">16:23</a> Sing to Yahweh, all the earth! Display his salvation from day to day.</p>

 <p><a name="an_16:32">16:32</a> Let the sea roar, and its fullness! Let the field exult, and all that is therein!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:33">16:33</a> Then the trees of the forest will sing for joy before Yahweh, for he comes to judge the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:34">16:34</a> Oh give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good, for his loving kindness endures forever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:35">16:35</a> Say, "Save us, God of our salvation! Gather us together and deliver us from the nations, to give thanks to your holy name, to triumph in your praise."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:36">16:36</a> Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, from everlasting even to everlasting. All the people said, "Amen," and praised Yahweh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:37">16:37</a> So he left there, before the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, Asaph and his brothers, to minister before the ark continually, as every day's work required;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:38">16:38</a> and Obed-Edom with their brothers, sixty-eight; Obed-Edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be doorkeepers;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:39">16:39</a> and Zadok the priest, and his brothers the priests, before the tabernacle of Yahweh in the high place that was at Gibeon,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:40">16:40</a> to offer burnt offerings to Yahweh on the altar of burnt offering continually morning and evening, even according to all that is written in the law of Yahweh, which he commanded to Israel;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:41">16:41</a> and with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest who were chosen, who were mentioned by name, to give thanks to Yahweh, because his loving kindness endures forever;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:42">16:42</a> and with them Heman and Jeduthun [with] trumpets and cymbals for those that should sound aloud, and [with] instruments for the songs of God; and the sons of Jeduthun to be at the gate.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:43">16:43</a> All the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:1">17:1</a> It happened, when David lived in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, "Behold, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of Yahweh is under curtains."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:2">17:2</a> Nathan said to David, "Do all that is in your heart; for God is with you."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:3">17:3</a> It happened the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:4">17:4</a> "Go and tell David my servant, 'Thus says Yahweh, "You shall not build me a house to dwell in;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:5">17:5</a> for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up Israel, to this day, but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tent to another.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:6">17:6</a> In all places in which I have walked with all Israel, did I speak a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people, saying, 'Why have you not built me a house of cedar?'"'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:7">17:7</a> "Now therefore, you shall tell my servant David, 'Thus says Yahweh of Armies, "I took you from the sheep pen, from following the sheep, that you should be prince over my people Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:8">17:8</a> I have been with you wherever you have gone, and have cut off all your enemies from before you. I will make you a name, like the name of the great ones who are in the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:9">17:9</a> I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the first,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:10">17:10</a> and from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel; and I will subdue all your enemies. Moreover I tell you that Yahweh will build you a house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:11">17:11</a> It shall happen, when your days are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fathers, that I will set up your seed after you, who shall be of your sons; and I will establish his kingdom.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:12">17:12</a> He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne forever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:13">17:13</a> I will be his father, and he shall be my son. I will not take my loving kindness away from him, as I took it from him that was before you;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:14">17:14</a> but I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom forever. His throne shall be established forever."'"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:15">17:15</a> According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:16">17:16</a> Then David the king went in, and sat before Yahweh; and he said, "Who am I, Yahweh God, and what is my house, that you have brought me thus far?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:17">17:17</a> This was a small thing in your eyes, God; but you have spoken of your servant's house for a great while to come, and have respected me according to the estate of a man of high degree, Yahweh God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:18">17:18</a> What can David say yet more to you concerning the honor which is done to your servant? For you know your servant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:19">17:19</a> Yahweh, for your servant's sake, and according to your own heart, you have worked all this greatness, to make known all these great things.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:20">17:20</a> Yahweh, there is none like you, neither is there any God besides you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:21">17:21</a> What one nation in the earth is like your people Israel, whom God went to redeem to himself for a people, to make you a name by great and awesome things, in driving out nations from before your people, whom you redeem out of Egypt?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:22">17:22</a> For your people Israel you made your own people forever; and you, Yahweh, became their God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:23">17:23</a> Now, Yahweh, let the word that you have spoken concerning your servant, and concerning his house, be established forever, and do as you have spoken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:24">17:24</a> Let your name be established and magnified forever, saying, 'Yahweh of Armies is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel. The house of David your servant is established before you.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:25">17:25</a> For you, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build him a house. Therefore your servant has found courage to pray before you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:26">17:26</a> Now, Yahweh, you are God, and have promised this good thing to your servant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:27">17:27</a> Now it has pleased you to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever before you; for you, Yahweh, have blessed, and it is blessed forever."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:1">18:1</a> After this it happened, that David struck the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and its towns out of the hand of the Philistines.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:2">18:2</a> He struck Moab; and the Moabites became servants to David, and brought tribute.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:3">18:3</a> David struck Hadadezer king of Zobah to Hamath, as he went to establish his dominion by the river Euphrates.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:4">18:4</a> David took from him one thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen; and David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for one hundred chariots.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:5">18:5</a> When the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David struck of the Syrians twenty-two thousand men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:6">18:6</a> Then David put [garrisons] in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought tribute. Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:7">18:7</a> David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:8">18:8</a> From Tibhath and from Cun, cities of Hadadezer, David took very much brass, with which Solomon made the bronze sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:9">18:9</a> When Tou king of Hamath heard that David had struck all the army of Hadadezer king of Zobah,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:10">18:10</a> he sent Hadoram his son to king David, to Greet him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and struck him; (for Hadadezer had wars with Tou;) and [he had with him] all kinds of vessels of gold and silver and brass.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:11">18:11</a> These also did king David dedicate to Yahweh, with the silver and the gold that he carried away from all the nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:12">18:12</a> Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah struck of the Edomites in the Valley of Salt eighteen thousand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:13">18:13</a> He put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became servants to David. Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:14">18:14</a> David reigned over all Israel; and he executed justice and righteousness to all his people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:15">18:15</a> Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:16">18:16</a> and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were priests; and Shavsha was scribe;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:17">18:17</a> and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:1">19:1</a> It happened after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:2">19:2</a> David said, "I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me." So David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:3">19:3</a> But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, "Do you think that David honors your father, in that he has sent comforters to you? Haven't his servants come to you to search, to overthrow, and to spy out the land?"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:4">19:4</a> So Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:5">19:5</a> Then there went certain persons, and told David how the men were served. He sent to meet them; for the men were greatly ashamed. The king said, "Stay at Jericho until your beards have grown, and then return."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:6">19:6</a> When the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent one thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Arammaacah, and out of Zobah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:7">19:7</a> So they hired for themselves thirty-two thousand chariots, and the king of Maacah and his people, who came and encamped before Medeba. The children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:8">19:8</a> When David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the army of the mighty men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:9">19:9</a> The children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the gate of the city: and the kings who had come were by themselves in the field.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:10">19:10</a> Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:11">19:11</a> The rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother; and they put themselves in array against the children of Ammon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:12">19:12</a> He said, "If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you are to help me; but if the children of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will help you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:13">19:13</a> Be courageous, and let us be strong for our people, and for the cities of our God. May Yahweh do that which seems good to him."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:14">19:14</a> So Joab and the people who were with him drew near before the Syrians to the battle; and they fled before him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:15">19:15</a> When the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:16">19:16</a> When the Syrians saw that they were defeated by Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians who were beyond the River, with Shophach the captain of the army of Hadadezer at their head.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:17">19:17</a> It was told David; and he gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came on them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:18">19:18</a> The Syrians fled before Israel; and David killed of the Syrians [the men of] seven thousand chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the army.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:19">19:19</a> When the servants of Hadadezer saw that they were defeated by Israel, they made peace with David, and served him: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:1">20:1</a> It happened, at the time of the return of the year, at the time when kings go out [to battle], that Joab led forth the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed at Jerusalem. Joab struck Rabbah, and overthrew it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:2">20:2</a> David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it; and it was set on David's head: and he brought forth the spoil of the city, exceeding much.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:3">20:3</a> He brought forth the people who were therein, and cut [them] with saws, and with iron picks, and with axes. David did so to all the cities of the children of Ammon. David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:4">20:4</a> It happened after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines: then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai, of the sons of the giant; and they were subdued.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:5">20:5</a> There was again war with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:6">20:6</a> There was again war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were twenty-four, six [on each hand], and six [on each foot]; and he also was born to the giant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:7">20:7</a> When he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David's brother killed him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:8">20:8</a> These were born to the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:1">21:1</a> Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David to number Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:2">21:2</a> David said to Joab and to the princes of the people, "Go, number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring me word, that I may know the sum of them."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:3">21:3</a> Joab said, "May Yahweh make his people a hundred times as many as they are. But, my lord the king, aren't they all my lord's servants? Why does my lord require this thing? Why will he be a cause of guilt to Israel?"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:4">21:4</a> Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab. Therefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:5">21:5</a> Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to David. All those of Israel were one million one hundred thousand men who drew sword: and in Judah were four hundred seventy thousand men who drew sword.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:6">21:6</a> But he didn't count Levi and Benjamin among them; for the king's word was abominable to Joab.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:7">21:7</a> God was displeased with this thing; therefore he struck Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:8">21:8</a> David said to God, "I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing. But now, put away, I beg you, the iniquity of your servant; for I have done very foolishly."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:9">21:9</a> Yahweh spoke to Gad, David's seer, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:10">21:10</a> "Go and speak to David, saying, 'Thus says Yahweh, "I offer you three things. Choose one of them, that I may do it to you."'"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:11">21:11</a> So Gad came to David, and said to him, "Thus says Yahweh, 'Take your choice:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:12">21:12</a> either three years of famine; or three months to be consumed before your foes, while the sword of your enemies overtakes you; or else three days the sword of Yahweh, even pestilence in the land, and the angel of Yahweh destroying throughout all the borders of Israel. Now therefore consider what answer I shall return to him who sent me.'"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:13">21:13</a> David said to Gad, "I am in distress. Let me fall, I pray, into the hand of Yahweh; for his mercies are very great. Let me not fall into the hand of man."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:14">21:14</a> So Yahweh sent a pestilence on Israel; and seventy thousand men of Israel fell.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:15">21:15</a> God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it. As he was about to destroy, Yahweh saw, and he relented of the disaster, and said to the destroying angel, "It is enough; now stay your hand." The angel of Yahweh was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:16">21:16</a> David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of Yahweh standing between earth and the sky, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:17">21:17</a> David said to God, "Isn't it I who commanded the people to be numbered? It is even I who have sinned and done very wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand, O Yahweh my God, be against me, and against my father's house; but not against your people, that they should be plagued."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:18">21:18</a> Then the angel of Yahweh commanded Gad to tell David that David should go up, and raise an altar to Yahweh in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:19">21:19</a> David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spoke in the name of Yahweh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:20">21:20</a> Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:21">21:21</a> As David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing floor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:22">21:22</a> Then David said to Ornan, "Give me the place of this threshing floor, that I may build thereon an altar to Yahweh. You shall sell it to me for the full price, that the plague may be stopped from afflicting the people."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:23">21:23</a> Ornan said to David, "Take it for yourself, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes. Behold, I give the oxen for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal offering. I give it all."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:24">21:24</a> King David said to Ornan, "No; but I will most certainly buy it for the full price. For I will not take that which is yours for Yahweh, nor offer a burnt offering without cost."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:25">21:25</a> So David gave to Ornan six hundred shekels of gold by weight for the place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:26">21:26</a> David built an altar to Yahweh there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called on Yahweh; and he answered him from the sky by fire on the altar of burnt offering.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:27">21:27</a> Yahweh commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into its sheath.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:28">21:28</a> At that time, when David saw that Yahweh had answered him in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:29">21:29</a> For the tabernacle of Yahweh, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering, were at that time in the high place at Gibeon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:30">21:30</a> But David couldn't go before it to inquire of God; for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of Yahweh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:1">22:1</a> Then David said, "This is the house of Yahweh God, and this is the altar of burnt offering for Israel."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:2">22:2</a> David gave orders to gather together the foreigners who were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to cut worked stones to build the house of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:3">22:3</a> David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the couplings; and brass in abundance without weight;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:4">22:4</a> and cedar trees without number: for the Sidonians and they of Tyre brought cedar trees in abundance to David.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:5">22:5</a> David said, "Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be built for Yahweh must be exceedingly magnificent, of fame and of glory throughout all countries. I will therefore make preparation for it." So David prepared abundantly before his death.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:6">22:6</a> Then he called for Solomon his son, and commanded him to build a house for Yahweh, the God of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:7">22:7</a> David said to Solomon his son, "As for me, it was in my heart to build a house to the name of Yahweh my God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:8">22:8</a> But the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 'You have shed blood abundantly, and have made great wars. You shall not build a house to my name, because you have shed much blood on the earth in my sight.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:9">22:9</a> Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of rest. I will give him rest from all his enemies all around; for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:10">22:10</a> He shall build a house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:11">22:11</a> Now, my son, may Yahweh be with you and prosper you, and build the house of Yahweh your God, as he has spoken concerning you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:12">22:12</a> May Yahweh give you discretion and understanding, and put you in charge of Israel; that so you may keep the law of Yahweh your God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:13">22:13</a> Then you will prosper, if you observe to do the statutes and the ordinances which Yahweh gave Moses concerning Israel. Be strong, and courageous. Don't be afraid, neither be dismayed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:14">22:14</a> Now, behold, in my affliction I have prepared for the house of Yahweh one hundred thousand talents of gold, one million talents of silver, and brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance. I have also prepared timber and stone; and you may add to them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:15">22:15</a> There are also workmen with you in abundance, cutters and workers of stone and timber, and all kinds of men who are skillful in every kind of work:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:16">22:16</a> of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is no number. Arise and be doing, and may Yahweh be with you."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:17">22:17</a> David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:18">22:18</a> "Isn't Yahweh your God with you? Hasn't he given you rest on every side? For he has delivered the inhabitants of the land into my hand; and the land is subdued before Yahweh, and before his people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:19">22:19</a> Now set your heart and your soul to seek after Yahweh your God. Arise therefore, and build the sanctuary of Yahweh God, to bring the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of Yahweh."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:1">23:1</a> Now David was old and full of days; and he made Solomon his son king over Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:2">23:2</a> He gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:3">23:3</a> The Levites were numbered from thirty years old and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty-eight thousand.</p>

 <p><a name="an_23:5">23:5</a> four thousand were doorkeepers; and four thousand praised Yahweh with the instruments which I made, for giving praise."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:6">23:6</a> David divided them into divisions according to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.</p>

 <p><a name="an_23:11">23:11</a> Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah didn't have many sons; therefore they became a fathers' house in one reckoning.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:12">23:12</a> The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.</p>

 <p><a name="an_23:14">23:14</a> But as for Moses the man of God, his sons were named among the tribe of Levi.</p>

 <p><a name="an_23:23">23:23</a> The sons of Mushi: Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:24">23:24</a> These were the sons of Levi after their fathers' houses, even the heads of the fathers' houses of those who were counted individually, in the number of names by their polls, who did the work for the service of the house of Yahweh, from twenty years old and upward.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:25">23:25</a> For David said, "Yahweh, the God of Israel, has given rest to his people; and he dwells in Jerusalem forever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:26">23:26</a> Also the Levites will no longer need to carry the tabernacle and all its vessels for its service."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:27">23:27</a> For by the last words of David the sons of Levi were numbered, from twenty years old and upward.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:28">23:28</a> For their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of Yahweh, in the courts, and in the rooms, and in the purifying of all holy things, even the work of the service of the house of God;</p>

 <p><a name="an_24:4">24:4</a> There were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and [thus] were they divided: of the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen, heads of fathers' houses; and of the sons of Ithamar, according to their fathers' houses, eight.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:5">24:5</a> Thus were they divided impartially by drawing lots; for there were princes of the sanctuary, and princes of God, both of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.</p>

 <p><a name="an_27:17">27:17</a> of Levi, Hashabiah the son of Kemuel: of Aaron, Zadok:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:18">27:18</a> of Judah, Elihu, one of the brothers of David: of Issachar, Omri the son of Michael:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:19">27:19</a> of Zebulun, Ishmaiah the son of Obadiah: of Naphtali, Jeremoth the son of Azriel:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:20">27:20</a> of the children of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Azaziah: of the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joel the son of Pedaiah:</p>

 <p><a name="an_27:22">27:22</a> of Dan, Azarel the son of Jeroham. These were the captains of the tribes of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:23">27:23</a> But David didn't take the number of them from twenty years old and under, because Yahweh had said he would increase Israel like the stars of the sky.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:24">27:24</a> Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number, but didn't finish; and there came wrath for this on Israel; neither was the number put into the account in the chronicles of king David.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:25">27:25</a> Over the king's treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel: and over the treasures in the fields, in the cities, and in the villages, and in the towers, was Jonathan the son of Uzziah:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:26">27:26</a> Over those who did the work of the field for tillage of the ground was Ezri the son of Chelub:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:27">27:27</a> and over the vineyards was Shimei the Ramathite: and over the increase of the vineyards for the winecellars was Zabdi the Shiphmite:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:28">27:28</a> and over the olive trees and the sycamore trees that were in the lowland was Baal Hanan the Gederite: and over the cellars of oil was Joash:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:29">27:29</a> and over the herds that fed in Sharon was Shitrai the Sharonite: and over the herds that were in the valleys was Shaphat the son of Adlai:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:30">27:30</a> and over the camels was Obil the Ishmaelite: and over the donkeys was Jehdeiah the Meronothite: and over the flocks was Jaziz the Hagrite.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:31">27:31</a> All these were the rulers of the substance which was king David's.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:32">27:32</a> Also Jonathan, David's uncle, was a counselor, a man of understanding, and a scribe: and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was with the king's sons:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:33">27:33</a> Ahithophel was the king's counselor: and Hushai the Archite was the king's friend:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:34">27:34</a> and after Ahithophel was Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, and Abiathar: and the captain of the king's army was Joab.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:1">28:1</a> David assembled all the princes of Israel, the princes of the tribes, and the captains of the companies who served the king by division, and the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds, and the rulers over all the substance and possessions of the king and of his sons, with the officers, and the mighty men, even all the mighty men of valor, to Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:2">28:2</a> Then David the king stood up on his feet, and said, "Hear me, my brothers, and my people! As for me, it was in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, and for the footstool of our God; and I had prepared for the building.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:3">28:3</a> But God said to me, 'You shall not build a house for my name, because you are a man of war, and have shed blood.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:4">28:4</a> However Yahweh, the God of Israel, chose me out of all the house of my father to be king over Israel forever. For he has chosen Judah to be prince; and in the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he took pleasure in me to make me king over all Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:5">28:5</a> Of all my sons (for Yahweh has given me many sons), he has chosen Solomon my son to sit on the throne of Yahweh's kingdom over Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:6">28:6</a> He said to me, 'Solomon, your son, shall build my house and my courts; for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:7">28:7</a> I will establish his kingdom forever, if he continues to do my commandments and my ordinances, as at this day.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:8">28:8</a> Now therefore, in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of Yahweh, and in the audience of our God, observe and seek out all the commandments of Yahweh your God; that you may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children after you forever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:9">28:9</a> You, Solomon my son, know the God of your father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind; for Yahweh searches all hearts, and understands all the imaginations of the thoughts. If you seek him, he will be found by you; but if you forsake him, he will cast you off forever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:10">28:10</a> Take heed now; for Yahweh has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary. Be strong, and do it."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:11">28:11</a> Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch [of the temple], and of its houses, and of its treasuries, and of the upper rooms of it, and of the inner rooms of it, and of the place of the mercy seat;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:12">28:12</a> and the pattern of all that he had by the Spirit, for the courts of the house of Yahweh, and for all the surrounding rooms, for the treasuries of the house of God, and for the treasuries of the dedicated things;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:13">28:13</a> also for the divisions of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of Yahweh, and for all the vessels of service in the house of Yahweh;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:14">28:14</a> of gold by weight for the [vessels of] gold, for all vessels of every kind of service; [of silver] for all the vessels of silver by weight, for all vessels of every kind of service;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:15">28:15</a> by weight also for the lampstands of gold, and for its lamps, of gold, by weight for every lampstand and for its lamps; and for the lampstands of silver, [silver] by weight for [every] lampstand and for its lamps, according to the use of every lampstand;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:16">28:16</a> and the gold by weight for the tables of show bread, for every table; and silver for the tables of silver;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:17">28:17</a> and the forks, and the basins, and the cups, of pure gold; and for the golden bowls by weight for every bowl; and for the silver bowls by weight for every bowl;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:18">28:18</a> and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot, [even] the cherubim, that spread out [their wings], and covered the ark of the covenant of Yahweh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:19">28:19</a> "All this," said David, "I have been made to understand in writing from the hand of Yahweh, even all the works of this pattern."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:20">28:20</a> David said to Solomon his son, "Be strong and courageous, and do it. Don't be afraid, nor be dismayed; for Yahweh God, even my God, is with you. He will not fail you, nor forsake you, until all the work for the service of the house of Yahweh is finished.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:21">28:21</a> Behold, there are the divisions of the priests and the Levites, for all the service of the house of God. There shall be with you in all kinds of work every willing man who has skill, for any kind of service. Also the captains and all the people will be entirely at your command."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:1">29:1</a> David the king said to all the assembly, "Solomon my son, whom alone God has chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great; for the palace is not for man, but for Yahweh God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:2">29:2</a> Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for the [things of] gold, and the silver for the [things of] silver, and the brass for the [things of] brass, the iron for the [things of] iron, and wood for the [things of] wood; onyx stones, and [stones] to be set, stones for inlaid work, and of various colors, and all kinds of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:3">29:3</a> In addition, because I have set my affection on the house of my God, since I have a treasure of my own of gold and silver, I give it to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:4">29:4</a> even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, with which to overlay the walls of the houses;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:5">29:5</a> of gold for the [things of] gold, and of silver for the [things of] silver, and for all kinds of work [to be made] by the hands of artificers. Who then offers willingly to consecrate himself this day to Yahweh?"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:6">29:6</a> Then the princes of the fathers' [houses], and the princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers over the king's work, offered willingly;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:7">29:7</a> and they gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand darics, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and of iron a hundred thousand talents.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:8">29:8</a> They with whom [precious] stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of Yahweh, under the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:9">29:9</a> Then the people rejoiced, because they offered willingly, because with a perfect heart they offered willingly to Yahweh: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:10">29:10</a> Therefore David blessed Yahweh before all the assembly; and David said, "You are blessed, Yahweh, the God of Israel our father, forever and ever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:11">29:11</a> Yours, Yahweh, is the greatness, the power, the glory, the victory, and the majesty! For all that is in the heavens and in the earth is yours. Yours is the kingdom, Yahweh, and you are exalted as head above all.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:12">29:12</a> Both riches and honor come from you, and you rule over all; and in your hand is power and might; and it is in your hand to make great, and to give strength to all.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:13">29:13</a> Now therefore, our God, we thank you, and praise your glorious name.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:14">29:14</a> But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly as this? For all things come from you, and of your own have we given you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:15">29:15</a> For we are strangers before you, and foreigners, as all our fathers were. Our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is no remaining.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:16">29:16</a> Yahweh our God, all this store that we have prepared to build you a house for your holy name comes from your hand, and is all your own.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:17">29:17</a> I know also, my God, that you try the heart, and have pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things. Now have I seen with joy your people, that are present here, offer willingly to you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:18">29:18</a> Yahweh, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this forever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of your people, and prepare their heart for you;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:19">29:19</a> and give to Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep your commandments, your testimonies, and your statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for which I have made provision."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:20">29:20</a> David said to all the assembly, "Now bless Yahweh your God!" All the assembly blessed Yahweh, the God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads and prostrated themselves before Yahweh and the king.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:21">29:21</a> They sacrificed sacrifices to Yahweh, and offered burnt offerings to Yahweh, on the next day after that day, even one thousand bulls, one thousand rams, and one thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:22">29:22</a> and ate and drink before Yahweh on that day with great gladness. They made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him to Yahweh to be prince, and Zadok to be priest.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:23">29:23</a> Then Solomon sat on the throne of Yahweh as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:24">29:24</a> All the princes, the mighty men, and also all of the sons of king David submitted themselves to Solomon the king.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:25">29:25</a> Yahweh magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed on him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:26">29:26</a> Now David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:27">29:27</a> The time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; he reigned seven years in Hebron, and thirty-three [years] reigned he in Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:28">29:28</a> He died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor: and Solomon his son reigned in his place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:29">29:29</a> Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the history of Samuel the seer, and in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the history of Gad the seer,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:30">29:30</a> with all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.</p>
