 <p><a name="000"><b>Hiel</b></a>     Life of (i.e., from) God, a native of Bethel, who built (i.e., fortified) Jericho some seven hundred years after its destruction by the Israelites. There fell on him for such an act the imprecation of Joshua (<a href="../kjv/jos006.htm#026">Jos 6:26</a>). He laid the foundation in his first-born, and set up the gates in his youngest son (<a href="../kjv/kg1016.htm#034">Kg1 16:34</a>), i.e., during the progress of the work all his children died. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="001"><b>Hierapolis</b></a>     Sacred city, a city of Phrygia, where was a Christian church under the care of Epaphras (<a href="../kjv/col004.htm#012">Col 4:12</a>, <a href="../kjv/col004.htm#013">Col 4:13</a>). This church was founded at the same time as that of Colosse. It now bears the name of Pambuk-Kalek, i.e., "Cotton Castle", from the white appearance of the cliffs at the base of which the ruins are found. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="002"><b>Higgaion</b></a>     In <a href="../kjv/psa092.htm#003">Psa 92:3</a> means the murmuring tone of the harp. In <a href="../kjv/psa009.htm#016">Psa 9:16</a> it is a musical sign, denoting probably a pause in the instrumental interlude. In <a href="../kjv/psa019.htm#014">Psa 19:14</a> the word is rendered "meditation;" and in <a href="../kjv/lam003.htm#062">Lam 3:62</a>, "device" (R.V., "imagination"). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="003"><b>High Place</b></a>     An eminence, natural or artificial, where worship by sacrifice or offerings was made (<a href="../kjv/kg1013.htm#032">Kg1 13:32</a>; <a href="../kjv/kg2017.htm#029">Kg2 17:29</a>). The first altar after the Flood was built on a mountain (<a href="../kjv/gen008.htm#020">Gen 8:20</a>). Abraham also built an altar on a mountain (<a href="../kjv/gen012.htm#007">Gen 12:7</a>, <a href="../kjv/gen012.htm#008">Gen 12:8</a>). It was on a mountain in Gilead that Laban and Jacob offered sacrifices (<a href="../kjv/gen031.htm#054">Gen 31:54</a>). After the Israelites entered the Promised Land they were strictly enjoined to overthrow the high places of the Canaanites (<a href="../kjv/exo034.htm#013">Exo 34:13</a>; <a href="../kjv/deu007.htm#005">Deu 7:5</a>; <a href="../kjv/deu012.htm#002">Deu 12:2</a>, <a href="../kjv/deu012.htm#003">Deu 12:3</a>), and they were forbidden to worship the Lord on high places (<a href="../kjv/deu012.htm#011">Deu 12:11</a>), and were enjoined to use but one altar for sacrifices (<a href="../kjv/lev017.htm#003">Lev 17:3</a>, <a href="../kjv/lev017.htm#004">Lev 17:4</a>; Deut. 12; <a href="../kjv/deu016.htm#021">Deu 16:21</a>). The injunction against high places was, however, very imperfectly obeyed, and we find again and again mention made of them (<a href="../kjv/kg2014.htm#004">Kg2 14:4</a>; <a href="../kjv/kg2015.htm#004">Kg2 15:4</a>, <a href="../kjv/kg2015.htm#035">Kg2 15:35</a>; <a href="../kjv/ch2015.htm#017">Ch2 15:17</a>, etc.). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="004"><b>High Priest</b></a>     Aaron was the first who was solemnly set apart to this office (<a href="../kjv/exo029.htm#007">Exo 29:7</a>; <a href="../kjv/exo030.htm#023">Exo 30:23</a>; <a href="../kjv/lev008.htm#012">Lev 8:12</a>). He wore a peculiar dress, which on his death passed to his successor in office (<a href="../kjv/exo029.htm#029">Exo 29:29</a>, <a href="../kjv/exo029.htm#030">Exo 29:30</a>). Besides those garments which he wore in common with all priests, there were four that were peculiar to himself as high priest:     (1.) The "robe" of the ephod, all of blue, of "woven work," worn immediately under the ephod. It was without seam or sleeves. The hem or skirt was ornamented with pomegranates and golden bells, seventy-two of each in alternate order. The sounding of the bells intimated to the people in the outer court the time when the high priest entered into the holy place to burn incense before the Lord (Ex. 28). (2.) The "ephod" consisted of two parts, one of which covered the back and the other the breast, which were united by the "curious girdle." It was made of fine twined linen, and ornamented with gold and purple. Each of the shoulder-straps was adorned with a precious stone, on which the names of the twelve tribes were engraved. This was the high priest's distinctive vestment (<a href="../kjv/sa1002.htm#028">Sa1 2:28</a>; <a href="../kjv/sa1014.htm#003">Sa1 14:3</a>; <a href="../kjv/sa1021.htm#009">Sa1 21:9</a>; <a href="../kjv/sa1023.htm#006">Sa1 23:6</a>, <a href="../kjv/sa1023.htm#009">Sa1 23:9</a>; <a href="../kjv/sa1030.htm#007">Sa1 30:7</a>). (3.) The "breastplate of judgment" (<a href="../kjv/exo028.htm#006">Exo 28:6</a>, <a href="../kjv/exo028.htm#025">Exo 28:25</a>; <a href="../kjv/exo039.htm#002">Exo 39:2</a>) of "cunning work." It was a piece of cloth doubled, of one span square. It bore twelve precious stones, set in four rows of three in a row, which constituted the Urim and Thummim (q.v.). These stones had the names of the twelve tribes engraved on them. When the high priest, clothed with the ephod and the breastplate, inquired of the Lord, answers were given in some mysterious way by the Urim and Thummim (<a href="../kjv/sa1014.htm#003">Sa1 14:3</a>, <a href="../kjv/sa1014.htm#018">Sa1 14:18</a>, <a href="../kjv/sa1014.htm#019">Sa1 14:19</a>; <a href="../kjv/sa1023.htm#002">Sa1 23:2</a>, <a href="../kjv/sa1023.htm#004">Sa1 23:4</a>, <a href="../kjv/sa1023.htm#009">Sa1 23:9</a>, <a href="../kjv/sa1023.htm#011">Sa1 23:11</a>, <a href="../kjv/sa1023.htm#012">Sa1 23:12</a>; <a href="../kjv/sa1028.htm#006">Sa1 28:6</a>; <a href="../kjv/sa2005.htm#023">Sa2 5:23</a>). (4.) The "mitre," or upper turban, a twisted band of eight yards of fine linen coiled into a cap, with a gold plate in front, engraved with "Holiness to the Lord," fastened to it by a ribbon of blue.    To the high priest alone it was permitted to enter the holy of holies, which he did only one a year, on the great Day of Atonement, for "the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest" (Heb. 9; 10). Wearing his gorgeous priestly vestments, he entered the temple before all the people, and then, laying them aside and assuming only his linen garments in secret, he entered the holy of holies alone, and made expiation, sprinkling the blood of the sin offering on the mercy seat, and offering up incense. Then resuming his splendid robes, he reappeared before the people (Lev. 16). Thus the wearing of these robes came to be identified with the Day of Atonement. The office, dress, and ministration of the high priest were typical of the priesthood of our Lord (<a href="../kjv/heb004.htm#014">Heb 4:14</a>; <a href="../kjv/heb007.htm#025">Heb 7:25</a>; <a href="../kjv/heb009.htm#012">Heb 9:12</a>, etc.). It is supposed that there were in all eighty-three high priests, beginning with Aaron (1657 B.C.) and ending with Phannias (A.D. 70). At its first institution the office of high priest was held for life (but compare <a href="../kjv/kg1002.htm#027">Kg1 2:27</a>), and was hereditary in the family of Aaron (<a href="../kjv/num003.htm#010">Num 3:10</a>). The office continued in the line of Eleazar, Aaron's eldest son, for two hundred and ninety-six years, when it passed to Eli, the first of the line of Ithamar, who was the fourth son of Aaron. In this line it continued to Abiathar, whom Solomon deposed, and appointed Zadok, of the family of Eleazar, in his stead (<a href="../kjv/kg1002.htm#035">Kg1 2:35</a>), in which it remained till the time of the Captivity. After the Return, Joshua, the son of Josedek, of the family of Eleazar, was appointed to this office. After him the succession was changed from time to time under priestly or political influences.

 <p><a name="005"><b>Highway</b></a>     A raised road for public use. Such roads were not found in Palestine; hence the force of the language used to describe the return of the captives and the advent of the Messiah (<a href="../kjv/isa011.htm#016">Isa 11:16</a>; <a href="../kjv/isa035.htm#008">Isa 35:8</a>; <a href="../kjv/isa040.htm#003">Isa 40:3</a>; <a href="../kjv/isa062.htm#010">Isa 62:10</a>) under the figure of the preparation of a grand thoroughfare for their march. During their possession of Palestine the Romans constructed several important highways, as they did in all countries which they ruled.

 <p><a name="006"><b>Hilkiah</b></a>     Portion of Jehovah.     (1.) <a href="../kjv/ch1006.htm#054">Ch1 6:54</a>. (2.) <a href="../kjv/ch1026.htm#011">Ch1 26:11</a>. (3.) The father of Eliakim (<a href="../kjv/kg2018.htm#018">Kg2 18:18</a>, <a href="../kjv/kg2018.htm#026">Kg2 18:26</a>, <a href="../kjv/kg2018.htm#037">Kg2 18:37</a>). (4.) The father of Gemariah (<a href="../kjv/jer029.htm#003">Jer 29:3</a>). (5.) The father of the prophet Jeremiah (<a href="../kjv/jer001.htm#001">Jer 1:1</a>). (6.) The high priest in the reign of Josiah (<a href="../kjv/ch1006.htm#013">Ch1 6:13</a>; <a href="../kjv/ezr007.htm#001">Ezr 7:1</a>). To him and his deputy (<a href="../kjv/kg2023.htm#005">Kg2 23:5</a>), along with the ordinary priests and the Levites who had charge of the gates, was entrusted the purification of the temple in Jerusalem. While this was in progress, he discovered in some hidden corner of the building a book called the "book of the law" (<a href="../kjv/kg2022.htm#008">Kg2 22:8</a>) and the "book of the covenant" (<a href="../kjv/kg2023.htm#002">Kg2 23:2</a>). Some have supposed that this "book" was nothing else than the original autograph copy of the Pentateuch written by Moses (Deut. 31:9-26). This remarkable discovery occurred in the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign (624 B.C.), a discovery which permanently affected the whole subsequent history of Israel. (See JOSIAH; SHAPHAN.)

 <p><a name="007"><b>Hill</b></a>      (1.) Heb.  gib'eah , a curved or rounded hill, such as are common to Palestine (<a href="../kjv/psa065.htm#012">Psa 65:12</a>; <a href="../kjv/psa072.htm#003">Psa 72:3</a>; <a href="../kjv/psa114.htm#004">Psa 114:4</a>, <a href="../kjv/psa114.htm#006">Psa 114:6</a>). (2.) Heb.  har , properly a mountain range rather than an individual eminence (<a href="../kjv/exo024.htm#004">Exo 24:4</a>, <a href="../kjv/exo024.htm#012">Exo 24:12</a>, <a href="../kjv/exo024.htm#013">Exo 24:13</a>, <a href="../kjv/exo024.htm#018">Exo 24:18</a>; <a href="../kjv/num014.htm#040">Num 14:40</a>, <a href="../kjv/num014.htm#044">Num 14:44</a>, <a href="../kjv/num014.htm#045">Num 14:45</a>).

(3.) Heb.  ma'aleh  in <a href="../kjv/sa1009.htm#011">Sa1 9:11</a>. Authorized Version "hill" is correctly rendered in the Revised Version "ascent." (4.) In <a href="../kjv/luk009.htm#037">Luk 9:37</a> the "hill" is the Mount of Transfiguration.

 <p><a name="008"><b>Hill of Evil Counsel</b></a>     On the south of the Valley of Hinnom. It is so called from a tradition that the house of the high priest Caiaphas, when the rulers of the Jews resolved to put Christ to death, stood here.
