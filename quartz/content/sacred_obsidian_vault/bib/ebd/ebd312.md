 <p><a name="000"><b>Reuben, Tribe of</b></a>     At the Exodus numbered 46,500 male adults, from twenty years old and upwards (<a href="../kjv/num001.htm#020">Num 1:20</a>, <a href="../kjv/num001.htm#021">Num 1:21</a>), and at the close of the wilderness wanderings they numbered only 43,730 (<a href="../kjv/num026.htm#007">Num 26:7</a>). This tribe united with that of Gad in asking permission to settle in the "land of Gilead," "on the other side of Jordan" (<a href="../kjv/num032.htm#001">Num 32:1</a>). The lot assigned to Reuben was the smallest of the lots given to the trans-Jordanic tribes. It extended from the Arnon, in the south along the coast of the Dead Sea to its northern end, where the Jordan flows into it (<a href="../kjv/jos013.htm#015">Jos 13:15</a>, <a href="../kjv/jos013.htm#023">Jos 13:23</a>). It thus embraced the original kingdom of Sihon. Reuben is "to the eastern tribes what Simeon is to the western. 'Unstable as water,' he vanishes away into a mere Arabian tribe. 'His men are few;' it is all he can do 'to live and not die.' We hear of nothing beyond the multiplication of their cattle in the land of Gilead, their spoils of 'camels fifty thousand, and of asses two thousand' (<a href="../kjv/ch1005.htm#009">Ch1 5:9</a>, <a href="../kjv/ch1005.htm#010">Ch1 5:10</a>, <a href="../kjv/ch1005.htm#020">Ch1 5:20</a>, <a href="../kjv/ch1005.htm#021">Ch1 5:21</a>). In the great struggles of the nation he never took part. The complaint against him in the song of Deborah is the summary of his whole history. 'By the streams of Reuben,' i.e., by the fresh streams which descend from the eastern hills into the Jordan and the Dead Sea, on whose banks the Bedouin chiefs met then as now to debate, in the 'streams' of Reuben great were the 'desires'", i.e., resolutions which were never carried out, the people idly resting among their flocks as if it were a time of peace (<a href="../kjv/jdg005.htm#015">Jdg 5:15</a>, <a href="../kjv/jdg005.htm#016">Jdg 5:16</a>). Stanley's Sinai and Palestine. All the three tribes on the east of Jordan at length fell into complete apostasy, and the time of retribution came. God "stirred up the spirit of Pul, king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tiglath-pileser, king of Assyria," to carry them away, the first of the tribes, into captivity (<a href="../kjv/ch1005.htm#025">Ch1 5:25</a>, <a href="../kjv/ch1005.htm#026">Ch1 5:26</a>).

 <p><a name="001"><b>Reuel</b></a>     Friend of God.     (1.) A son of Esau and Bashemath (<a href="../kjv/gen036.htm#004">Gen 36:4</a>, <a href="../kjv/gen036.htm#010">Gen 36:10</a>; <a href="../kjv/ch1001.htm#035">Ch1 1:35</a>). (2.) "The priest of Midian," Moses' father-in-law (<a href="../kjv/exo002.htm#018">Exo 2:18</a>) = Raguel (<a href="../kjv/num010.htm#029">Num 10:29</a>). If he be identified with Jethro (q.v.), then this may be regarded as his proper name, and Jether or Jethro (i.e., "excellency") as his official title. (3.) <a href="../kjv/num002.htm#014">Num 2:14</a>, called also Deuel (<a href="../kjv/num001.htm#014">Num 1:14</a>; <a href="../kjv/num007.htm#042">Num 7:42</a>).

 <p><a name="002"><b>Revelation</b></a>     An uncovering, a bringing to light of that which had been previously wholly hidden or only obscurely seen. God has been pleased in various ways and at different times (<a href="../kjv/heb001.htm#001">Heb 1:1</a>) to make a supernatural revelation of himself and his purposes and plans, which, under the guidance of his Spirit, has been committed to writing. (See WORD OF GOD.) The Scriptures are not merely the "record" of revelation; they are the revelation itself in a written form, in order to the accurate preservation and propagation of the truth. Revelation and inspiration differ. Revelation is the supernatural communication of truth to the mind; inspiration (q.v.) secures to the teacher or writer infallibility in communicating that truth to others. It renders its subject the spokesman or prophet of God in such a sense that everything he asserts to be true, whether fact or doctrine or moral principle, is true, infallibly true.

 <p><a name="003"><b>Revelation, Book of</b></a>     =The Apocalypse, the closing book and the only prophetical book of the New Testament canon. The author of this book was undoubtedly John the apostle. His name occurs four times in the book itself (<a href="../kjv/rev001.htm#001">Rev 1:1</a>, <a href="../kjv/rev001.htm#004">Rev 1:4</a>, <a href="../kjv/rev001.htm#009">Rev 1:9</a>; <a href="../kjv/rev022.htm#008">Rev 22:8</a>), and there is every reason to conclude that the "John" here mentioned was the apostle. In a manuscript of about the twelfth century he is called "John the divine," but no reason can be assigned for this appellation. The date of the writing of this book has generally been fixed at A.D.96, in the reign of Domitian. There are some, however, who contend for an earlier date, A.D. 68 or 69, in the reign of Nero. Those who are in favour of the later date appeal to the testimony of the Christian father Irenaeus, who received information relative to this book from those who had seen John face to face. He says that the Apocalypse "was seen no long time ago." As to the relation between this book and the Gospel of John, it has been well observed that "the leading ideas of both are the same. The one gives us in a magnificent vision, the other in a great historic drama, the supreme conflict between good and evil and its issue. In both Jesus Christ is the central figure, whose victory through defeat is the issue of the conflict. In both the Jewish dispensation is the preparation for the gospel, and the warfare and triumph of the Christ is described in language saturated with the Old Testament The difference of date will go a long way toward explaining the difference of style." Plummer's Gospel of St. John, Introd.

 <p><a name="004"><b>Revelation of Christ</b></a>     The second advent of Christ. Three different Greek words are used by the apostles to express this,     (1.)  apokalupsis  (1 Cor. 1; 7; <a href="../kjv/th2001.htm#007">Th2 1:7</a>; <a href="../kjv/pe1001.htm#007">Pe1 1:7</a>, <a href="../kjv/pe1001.htm#013">Pe1 1:13</a>); (2.)  parousia  (<a href="../kjv/mat024.htm#003">Mat 24:3</a>, <a href="../kjv/mat024.htm#027">Mat 24:27</a>; <a href="../kjv/th1002.htm#019">Th1 2:19</a>; <a href="../kjv/jam005.htm#007">Jam 5:7</a>, <a href="../kjv/jam005.htm#008">Jam 5:8</a>); (3.)  epiphaneia  (<a href="../kjv/ti1006.htm#014">Ti1 6:14</a>; <a href="../kjv/ti2001.htm#010">Ti2 1:10</a>; <a href="../kjv/ti2004.htm#001">Ti2 4:1</a>; <a href="../kjv/tit002.htm#013">Tit 2:13</a>). There existed among Christians a wide expectation, founded on <a href="../kjv/mat024.htm#029">Mat 24:29</a>, <a href="../kjv/mat024.htm#030">Mat 24:30</a>, <a href="../kjv/mat024.htm#034">Mat 24:34</a>, of the speedy return of Christ.

 <p><a name="005"><b>Rezeph</b></a>     Solid; a stone, (<a href="../kjv/kg2019.htm#012">Kg2 19:12</a>; <a href="../kjv/isa037.htm#012">Isa 37:12</a>), a fortress near Haran, probably on the west of the Euphrates, conquered by Sennacherib.

 <p><a name="006"><b>Rezin</b></a>     Firm; a prince, a king of Syria, who joined Pekah (q.v.) in an invasion of the kingdom of Judah (<a href="../kjv/kg2015.htm#037">Kg2 15:37</a>; <a href="../kjv/kg2016.htm#005">Kg2 16:5</a>; <a href="../kjv/isa007.htm#001">Isa 7:1</a>). Ahaz induced Tiglath-pileser III. to attack Damascus, and this caused Rezin to withdraw for the purpose of defending his own kingdom. Damascus was taken, and Rezin was slain in battle by the Assyrian king, and his people carried into captivity, 732 B.C. (<a href="../kjv/kg2016.htm#009">Kg2 16:9</a>).

 <p><a name="007"><b>Rezon</b></a>     Prince, son of Eliadah. Abandoning the service of Hadadezer, the king of Zobah, on the occasion of his being defeated by David, he became the "captain over a band" of marauders, and took Damascus, and became king of Syria (<a href="../kjv/kg1011.htm#023">Kg1 11:23</a>; <a href="../kjv/sa2008.htm#003">Sa2 8:3</a>). For centuries after this the Syrians were the foes of Israel. He "became an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon."
