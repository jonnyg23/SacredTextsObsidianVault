 <p><a name="000"><b>Gittith</b></a>     A stringed instrument of music. This word is found in the titles of <a href="../kjv/psa008.htm#001">Psa 8:1</a>, 81, <a href="../kjv/psa084.htm#001">Psa 84:1</a>. In these places the LXX. render the word by "on the wine-fats." The Targum explains by "on the harp which David brought from Gath." It is the only stringed instrument named in the titles of the Psalms.

 <p><a name="001"><b>Gizonite</b></a>     A name given to Hashem, an inhabitant of Gizoh, a place somewhere in the mountains of Judah (<a href="../kjv/ch1011.htm#034">Ch1 11:34</a>; <a href="../kjv/sa2023.htm#032">Sa2 23:32</a>, <a href="../kjv/sa2023.htm#034">Sa2 23:34</a>).

 <p><a name="002"><b>Glass</b></a>     Was known to the Egyptians at a very early period of their national history, at least 1500 B.C.. Various articles both useful and ornamental were made of it, as bottles, vases, etc. A glass bottle with the name of Sargon on it was found among the ruins of the north-west palace of Nimroud. The Hebrew word zekukith (<a href="../kjv/job028.htm#017">Job 28:17</a>), rendered in the Authorized Version "crystal," is rightly rendered in the Revised Version "glass." This is the only allusion to glass found in the Old Testament. It is referred to in the New Testament in <a href="../kjv/rev004.htm#006">Rev 4:6</a>; <a href="../kjv/rev015.htm#002">Rev 15:2</a>; <a href="../kjv/rev021.htm#018">Rev 21:18</a>, <a href="../kjv/rev021.htm#021">Rev 21:21</a>. In <a href="../kjv/job037.htm#018">Job 37:18</a>, the word rendered "looking-glass" is in the Revised Version properly rendered "mirror," formed, i.e., of some metal. (Compare <a href="../kjv/exo038.htm#008">Exo 38:8</a> : "looking-glasses" are brazen mirrors,R.V.). A mirror is referred to also in <a href="../kjv/jam001.htm#023">Jam 1:23</a>. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="003"><b>Glean</b></a>     The corners of fields were not to be reaped, and the sheaf accidentally left behind was not to be fetched away, according to the law of Moses (<a href="../kjv/lev019.htm#009">Lev 19:9</a>; <a href="../kjv/lev023.htm#022">Lev 23:22</a>; <a href="../kjv/deu024.htm#021">Deu 24:21</a>). They were to be left for the poor to glean. Similar laws were given regarding vineyards and oliveyards. (Compare <a href="../kjv/rut002.htm#002">Rut 2:2</a>.) 
 </p>
 <p><a name="004"><b>Glede</b></a>     An Old English name for the common kite, mentioned only in <a href="../kjv/deu014.htm#013">Deu 14:13</a> (Heb.  ra'ah ), the Milvus ater or black kite. The Hebrew word does not occur in the parallel passage in Leviticus (<a href="../kjv/lev011.htm#014">Lev 11:14</a>,  da'ah , rendered "vulture;" in R.V., "kite"). It was an unclean bird. The Hebrew name is from a root meaning "to see," "to look," thus designating a bird with a keen sight. The bird intended is probably the buzzard, of which there are three species found in Palestine. (See VULTURE.) 
 </p>
 <p><a name="005"><b>Glorify</b></a>      (1.) To make glorious, or cause so to appear (<a href="../kjv/joh012.htm#028">Joh 12:28</a>; <a href="../kjv/joh013.htm#031">Joh 13:31</a>, <a href="../kjv/joh013.htm#032">Joh 13:32</a>; <a href="../kjv/joh017.htm#004">Joh 17:4</a>, <a href="../kjv/joh017.htm#005">Joh 17:5</a>). (2.) Spoken of God to "shew forth his praise" (<a href="../kjv/co1006.htm#020">Co1 6:20</a>; <a href="../kjv/co1010.htm#031">Co1 10:31</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="006"><b>Glory</b></a>     (Heb.  kabhod ; Gr.  doxa ).     (1.) Abundance, wealth, treasure, and hence honour (<a href="../kjv/psa049.htm#012">Psa 49:12</a>); glory (<a href="../kjv/gen031.htm#001">Gen 31:1</a>; <a href="../kjv/mat004.htm#008">Mat 4:8</a>; <a href="../kjv/rev021.htm#024">Rev 21:24</a>, <a href="../kjv/rev021.htm#026">Rev 21:26</a>). (2.) Honour, dignity (<a href="../kjv/kg1003.htm#013">Kg1 3:13</a>; <a href="../kjv/heb002.htm#007">Heb 2:7</a> <a href="../kjv/pe1001.htm#024">Pe1 1:24</a>); of God (<a href="../kjv/psa019.htm#001">Psa 19:1</a>; <a href="../kjv/psa029.htm#001">Psa 29:1</a>); of the mind or heart (<a href="../kjv/gen049.htm#006">Gen 49:6</a>; <a href="../kjv/psa007.htm#005">Psa 7:5</a>; <a href="../kjv/act002.htm#046">Act 2:46</a>). (3.) Splendour, brightness, majesty (<a href="../kjv/gen045.htm#013">Gen 45:13</a>; <a href="../kjv/isa004.htm#005">Isa 4:5</a>; <a href="../kjv/act022.htm#011">Act 22:11</a>; <a href="../kjv/co2003.htm#007">Co2 3:7</a>); of Jehovah (<a href="../kjv/isa059.htm#019">Isa 59:19</a>; <a href="../kjv/isa060.htm#001">Isa 60:1</a>; <a href="../kjv/th2001.htm#009">Th2 1:9</a>). (4.) The glorious moral attributes, the infinite perfections of God (<a href="../kjv/isa040.htm#005">Isa 40:5</a>; <a href="../kjv/act007.htm#002">Act 7:2</a>; <a href="../kjv/rom001.htm#023">Rom 1:23</a>; <a href="../kjv/rom009.htm#023">Rom 9:23</a>; <a href="../kjv/eph001.htm#012">Eph 1:12</a>). Jesus is the "brightness of the Father's glory" (<a href="../kjv/heb001.htm#003">Heb 1:3</a>; <a href="../kjv/joh001.htm#014">Joh 1:14</a>; <a href="../kjv/joh002.htm#011">Joh 2:11</a>). (5.) The bliss of heaven (<a href="../kjv/rom002.htm#007">Rom 2:7</a>, <a href="../kjv/rom002.htm#010">Rom 2:10</a>; <a href="../kjv/rom005.htm#002">Rom 5:2</a>; <a href="../kjv/rom008.htm#018">Rom 8:18</a>; <a href="../kjv/heb002.htm#010">Heb 2:10</a>; <a href="../kjv/pe1005.htm#001">Pe1 5:1</a>, <a href="../kjv/pe1005.htm#010">Pe1 5:10</a>). (6.) The phrase "Give glory to God" (<a href="../kjv/jos007.htm#019">Jos 7:19</a>; <a href="../kjv/jer013.htm#016">Jer 13:16</a>) is a Hebrew idiom meaning, "Confess your sins." The words of the Jews to the blind man, "Give God the praise" (<a href="../kjv/joh009.htm#024">Joh 9:24</a>), are an adjuration to confess. They are equivalent to, "Confess that you are an impostor," "Give God the glory by speaking the truth;" for they denied that a miracle had been wrought. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="007"><b>Glutton</b></a>      (<a href="../kjv/deu021.htm#020">Deu 21:20</a>), Heb.  zolel , from a word meaning "to shake out," "to squander;" and hence one who is prodigal, who wastes his means by indulgence. In <a href="../kjv/pro023.htm#021">Pro 23:21</a>, the word means debauchers or wasters of their own body. In <a href="../kjv/pro028.htm#007">Pro 28:7</a>, the word (pl.) is rendered Authorized Version "riotous men;" Revised Version, "gluttonous." <a href="../kjv/mat011.htm#019">Mat 11:19</a>, <a href="../kjv/luk007.htm#034">Luk 7:34</a>, Greek  phagos , given to eating, gluttonous. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="008"><b>Gnash</b></a>     Heb.  harak , meaning "to grate the teeth", (<a href="../kjv/job016.htm#009">Job 16:9</a>; <a href="../kjv/psa112.htm#010">Psa 112:10</a>; <a href="../kjv/lam002.htm#016">Lam 2:16</a>), denotes rage or sorrow. (See also <a href="../kjv/act007.htm#054">Act 7:54</a>; <a href="../kjv/mar009.htm#018">Mar 9:18</a>.) 
 </p>
 <p><a name="009"><b>Gnat</b></a>     Only in <a href="../kjv/mat023.htm#024">Mat 23:24</a>, a small two-winged stinging fly of the genus Culex, which includes mosquitoes. Our Lord alludes here to the gnat in a proverbial expression probably in common use, "who strain out the gnat;" the words in the Authorized Version, "strain at a gnat," being a mere typographical error, which has been corrected in the Revised Version. The custom of filtering wine for this purpose was common among the Jews. It was founded on <a href="../kjv/lev011.htm#023">Lev 11:23</a>. It is supposed that the "lice," <a href="../kjv/exo008.htm#016">Exo 8:16</a> (marg. R.V., "sand-flies"), were a species of gnat.
