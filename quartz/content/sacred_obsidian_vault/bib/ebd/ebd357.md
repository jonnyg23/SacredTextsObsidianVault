 <p><a name="000"><b>Tabrimon</b></a>     Good is Rimmon, the father of Benhadad, king of Syria (<a href="../kjv/kg1015.htm#018">Kg1 15:18</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="001"><b>Taches</b></a>     Hooks or clasps by which the tabernacle curtains were connected (<a href="../kjv/exo026.htm#006">Exo 26:6</a>, <a href="../kjv/exo026.htm#011">Exo 26:11</a>, <a href="../kjv/exo026.htm#033">Exo 26:33</a>; <a href="../kjv/exo035.htm#011">Exo 35:11</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="002"><b>Tachmonite</b></a>     =Hachmonite a name given to Jashobeam (<a href="../kjv/sa2023.htm#008">Sa2 23:8</a>; compare <a href="../kjv/ch1011.htm#011">Ch1 11:11</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="003"><b>Tackling</b></a>     (<a href="../kjv/isa033.htm#023">Isa 33:23</a>), the ropes attached to the mast of a ship. In <a href="../kjv/act027.htm#019">Act 27:19</a> this word means generally the furniture of the ship or the "gear" (<a href="../kjv/act027.htm#017">Act 27:17</a>), all that could be removed from the ship. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="004"><b>Tadmor</b></a>     Palm, a city built by Solomon "in the wilderness" (<a href="../kjv/ch2008.htm#004">Ch2 8:4</a>). In <a href="../kjv/kg1009.htm#018">Kg1 9:18</a>, where the word occurs in the Authorized Version, the Hebrew text and the Revised Version read "Tamar," which is properly a city on the southern border of Palestine and toward the wilderness (compare <a href="../kjv/eze047.htm#019">Eze 47:19</a>; <a href="../kjv/eze048.htm#028">Eze 48:28</a>). In <a href="../kjv/ch2008.htm#014">Ch2 8:14</a> Tadmor is mentioned in connection with Hamath-zobah. It is called Palmyra by the Greeks and Romans. It stood in the great Syrian wilderness, 176 miles from Damascus and 130 from the Mediterranean and was the centre of a vast commercial traffic with Western Asia. It was also an important military station. (See SOLOMON.) "Remains of ancient temples and palaces, surrounded by splendid colonnades of white marble, many of which are yet standing, and thousands of prostrate pillars, scattered over a large extent of space, attest the ancient magnificence of this city of palms, surpassing that of the renowned cities of Greece and Rome."

 <p><a name="005"><b>Tahapanes</b></a>     =Tahpanhes=Tehaphnehes (called "Daphne" by the Greeks, now Tell Defenneh), an ancient Egyptian city, on the Tanitic branch of the Nile, about 16 miles from Pelusium. The Jews from Jerusalem fled to this place after the death of Gedaliah (q.v.), and settled there for a time (<a href="../kjv/jer002.htm#016">Jer 2:16</a>; <a href="../kjv/jer043.htm#007">Jer 43:7</a>; <a href="../kjv/jer044.htm#001">Jer 44:1</a>; <a href="../kjv/jer046.htm#014">Jer 46:14</a>). A platform of brick-work, which there is every reason to believe was the pavement at the entry of Pharaoh's palace, has been discovered at this place. "Here," says the discoverer, Mr. Petrie, "the ceremony described by Jeremiah [<a href="../kjv/jer043.htm#008">Jer 43:8</a>; "brick-kiln", i.e., pavement of brick] took place before the chiefs of the fugitives assembled on the platform, and here Nebuchadnezzar spread his royal pavilion" (R.V., "brickwork").

 <p><a name="006"><b>Tahpenes</b></a>     The wife of Pharaoh, who gave her sister in marriage to Hadad the Edomite (<a href="../kjv/kg1011.htm#019">Kg1 11:19</a>, <a href="../kjv/kg1011.htm#020">Kg1 11:20</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="007"><b>Tahtim-hodshi</b></a>     The land of the newly inhabited, (<a href="../kjv/sa2024.htm#006">Sa2 24:6</a>). It is conjectured that, instead of this word, the reading should be, "the Hittites of Kadesh," the Hittite capital, on the Orontes. It was apparently some region east of the Jordan and north of Gilead. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="008"><b>Tale</b></a>      (1.) Heb.  tokhen , "a task," as weighed and measured out = tally, i.e., the number told off; the full number (<a href="../kjv/exo005.htm#018">Exo 5:18</a>; see <a href="../kjv/sa1018.htm#027">Sa1 18:27</a>; <a href="../kjv/ch1009.htm#028">Ch1 9:28</a>). In <a href="../kjv/eze045.htm#011">Eze 45:11</a> rendered "measure." (2.) Heb.  hegeh , "a thought;" "meditation" (<a href="../kjv/psa090.htm#009">Psa 90:9</a>); meaning properly "as a whisper of sadness," which is soon over, or "as a thought." The LXX. and Vulgate render it "spider;" the Authorized Version and Revised Version, "as a tale" that is told. In <a href="../kjv/job037.htm#002">Job 37:2</a> this word is rendered "sound;" Revised Version margin, "muttering;" and in <a href="../kjv/eze002.htm#010">Eze 2:10</a>, "mourning." 
 </p>
 <p><a name="009"><b>Talent</b></a>     Of silver contained 3,000 shekels (<a href="../kjv/exo038.htm#025">Exo 38:25</a>, <a href="../kjv/exo038.htm#026">Exo 38:26</a>), and was equal to 94 3/7 lb. avoirdupois. The Greek talent, however, as in the LXX., was only 82 1/4 lb. It was in the form of a circular mass, as the Hebrew name  kikkar  denotes. A talent of gold was double the weight of a talent of silver (<a href="../kjv/sa2012.htm#030">Sa2 12:30</a>). Parable of the talents (<a href="../kjv/mat018.htm#024">Mat 18:24</a>; <a href="../kjv/mat025.htm#015">Mat 25:15</a>).
