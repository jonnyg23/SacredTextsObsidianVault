 <p><a name="000"><b>Spirit, Holy</b></a>     See HOLY GHOST. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="001"><b>Sponge</b></a>     Occurs only in the narrative of the crucifixion (<a href="../kjv/mat027.htm#048">Mat 27:48</a>; <a href="../kjv/mar015.htm#036">Mar 15:36</a>; <a href="../kjv/joh019.htm#029">Joh 19:29</a>). It is ranked as a zoophyte. It is found attached to rocks at the bottom of the sea. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="002"><b>Spouse</b></a>     (<a href="../kjv/sol004.htm#008">Sol 4:8</a>; <a href="../kjv/hos004.htm#013">Hos 4:13</a>, <a href="../kjv/hos004.htm#014">Hos 4:14</a>) may denote either husband or wife, but in the Scriptures it denotes only the latter. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="003"><b>Spring</b></a>     (Heb.  'ain , "the bright open source, the eye of the landscape"). To be carefully distinguished from "well" (q.v.). "Springs" mentioned in <a href="../kjv/jos010.htm#040">Jos 10:40</a> (Heb.  'ashdoth ) should rather be "declivities" or "slopes" (R.V.), i.e., the undulating ground lying between the lowlands (the  shephelah ) and the central range of hills. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="004"><b>Stachys</b></a>     Spike; an ear of corn, a convert at Rome whom Paul salutes (<a href="../kjv/rom016.htm#009">Rom 16:9</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="005"><b>Stacte</b></a>     (Heb.  nataph ), one of the components of the perfume which was offered on the golden altar (<a href="../kjv/exo030.htm#034">Exo 30:34</a>; R.V. marg., " opobalsamum "). The Hebrew word is from a root meaning "to distil," and it has been by some interpreted as distilled myrrh. Others regard it as the gum of the storax tree, or rather shrub, the Styrax officinale. "The Syrians value this gum highly, and use it medicinally as an emulsion in pectoral complaints, and also in perfumery." 
 </p>
 <p><a name="006"><b>Star, Morning</b></a>     A name figuratively given to Christ (<a href="../kjv/rev022.htm#016">Rev 22:16</a>; compare <a href="../kjv/pe2001.htm#019">Pe2 1:19</a>). When Christ promises that he will give the "morning star" to his faithful ones, he "promises that he will give to them himself, that he will give to them himself, that he will impart to them his own glory and a share in his own royal dominion; for the star is evermore the symbol of royalty (<a href="../kjv/mat002.htm#002">Mat 2:2</a>), being therefore linked with the sceptre (<a href="../kjv/num024.htm#017">Num 24:17</a>). All the glory of the world shall end in being the glory of the Church." Trench's Comm. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="007"><b>Stargazers</b></a>     (<a href="../kjv/isa047.htm#013">Isa 47:13</a>), those who pretend to tell what will occur by looking upon the stars. The Chaldean astrologers "divined by the rising and setting, the motions, aspects, colour, degree of light, etc., of the stars." 
 </p>
 <p><a name="008"><b>Stars</b></a>     The eleven stars (<a href="../kjv/gen037.htm#009">Gen 37:9</a>); the seven (<a href="../kjv/amo005.htm#008">Amo 5:8</a>); wandering (<a href="../kjv/jde001.htm#013">Jde 1:13</a>); seen in the east at the birth of Christ, probably some luminous meteors miraculously formed for this specific purpose (<a href="../kjv/mat002.htm#002">Mat 2:2</a>); stars worshipped (<a href="../kjv/deu004.htm#019">Deu 4:19</a>; <a href="../kjv/kg2017.htm#016">Kg2 17:16</a>; <a href="../kjv/kg2021.htm#003">Kg2 21:3</a>; <a href="../kjv/jer019.htm#013">Jer 19:13</a>); spoken of symbolically (<a href="../kjv/num024.htm#017">Num 24:17</a>; <a href="../kjv/rev001.htm#016">Rev 1:16</a>, <a href="../kjv/rev001.htm#020">Rev 1:20</a>; <a href="../kjv/rev012.htm#001">Rev 12:1</a>). (See ASTROLOGERS.) 
 </p>
 <p><a name="009"><b>Stater</b></a>     Greek word rendered "piece of money" (<a href="../kjv/mat017.htm#027">Mat 17:27</a>, A.V.; and "shekel" in R.V.). It was equal to two  didrachmas  ("tribute money," <a href="../kjv/mat017.htm#024">Mat 17:24</a>), or four  drachmas , and to about 2s. 6d. of our money. (See SHEKEL.)
