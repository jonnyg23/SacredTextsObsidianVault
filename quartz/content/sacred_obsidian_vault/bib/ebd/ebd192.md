 <p><a name="000"><b>Ivory</b></a>     (Heb. pl.  shenhabbim , the "tusks of elephants") was early used in decorations by the Egyptians, and a great trade in it was carried on by the Assyrians (<a href="../kjv/eze027.htm#006">Eze 27:6</a>; <a href="../kjv/rev018.htm#012">Rev 18:12</a>). It was used by the Phoenicians to ornament the box-wood rowing-benches of their galleys, and Hiram's skilled workmen made Solomon's throne of ivory (<a href="../kjv/kg1010.htm#018">Kg1 10:18</a>). It was brought by the caravans of Dedan (<a href="../kjv/isa021.htm#013">Isa 21:13</a>), and from the East Indies by the navy of Tarshish (<a href="../kjv/kg1010.htm#022">Kg1 10:22</a>). Many specimens of ancient Egyptian and Assyrian ivory-work have been preserved. The word habbim is derived from the Sanscrit ibhas, meaning "elephant," preceded by the Hebrew article (ha); and hence it is argued that Ophir, from which it and the other articles mentioned in <a href="../kjv/kg1010.htm#022">Kg1 10:22</a> were brought, was in India.
