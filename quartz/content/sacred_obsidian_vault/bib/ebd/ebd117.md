 <p><a name="000"><b>Elika</b></a>     God is his rejecter, one of David's thirty-seven distinguished heroes (<a href="../kjv/sa2023.htm#025">Sa2 23:25</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="001"><b>Elim</b></a>     Trees, (<a href="../kjv/exo015.htm#027">Exo 15:27</a>; <a href="../kjv/num033.htm#009">Num 33:9</a>), the name of the second station where the Israelites encamped after crossing the Red Sea. It had "twelve wells of water and threescore and ten palm trees." It has been identified with the Wady Ghurundel, the most noted of the four wades which descend from the range of et-Tih towards the sea. Here they probably remained some considerable time. The form of expression in <a href="../kjv/exo016.htm#001">Exo 16:1</a> seems to imply that the people proceeded in detachments or companies from Elim, and only for the first time were assembled as a complete host when they reached the wilderness of Sin (q.v.).

 <p><a name="002"><b>Elimelech</b></a>     God his king, a man of the tribe of Judah, of the family of the Hezronites, and kinsman of Boaz, who dwelt in Bethlehem in the days of the judges. In consequence of a great dearth he, with his wife Naomi and his two sons, went to dwell in the land of Moab. There he and his sons died (<a href="../kjv/rut001.htm#002">Rut 1:2</a>, <a href="../kjv/rut001.htm#003">Rut 1:3</a>; <a href="../kjv/rut002.htm#001">Rut 2:1</a>, <a href="../kjv/rut002.htm#003">Rut 2:3</a>; <a href="../kjv/rut004.htm#003">Rut 4:3</a>, <a href="../kjv/rut004.htm#009">Rut 4:9</a>). Naomi afterwards returned to Palestine with her daughter Ruth. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="003"><b>Elioenai</b></a>     Toward Jehovah are my eyes - the name of several men mentioned in the Old Testament (<a href="../kjv/ch1007.htm#008">Ch1 7:8</a>; <a href="../kjv/ch1004.htm#036">Ch1 4:36</a>; <a href="../kjv/ezr010.htm#022">Ezr 10:22</a>, <a href="../kjv/ezr010.htm#027">Ezr 10:27</a>). Among these was the eldest son of Neariah, son of Shemaiah, of the descendants of Zerubbabel. His family are the latest mentioned in the Old Testament (<a href="../kjv/ch1003.htm#023">Ch1 3:23</a>, <a href="../kjv/ch1003.htm#024">Ch1 3:24</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="004"><b>Eliphalet</b></a>     God his deliverance, one of David's sons (<a href="../kjv/sa2005.htm#016">Sa2 5:16</a>); called also Eliphelet (<a href="../kjv/ch1003.htm#008">Ch1 3:8</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="005"><b>Eliphaz</b></a>     God his strength.     (1.) One of Job's "three friends" who visited him in his affliction (<a href="../kjv/job004.htm#001">Job 4:1</a>). He was a "Temanite" - i.e., a native of Teman, in Idumea. He first enters into debate with Job. His language is uniformly more delicate and gentle than that of the other two, although he imputes to Job special sins as the cause of his present sufferings. He states with remarkable force of language the infinite purity and majesty of God (<a href="../kjv/job004.htm#012">Job 4:12</a>; <a href="../kjv/job015.htm#012">Job 15:12</a>). (2.) The son of Esau by his wife Adah, and father of several Edomitish tribes (<a href="../kjv/gen036.htm#004">Gen 36:4</a>, <a href="../kjv/gen036.htm#010">Gen 36:10</a>, <a href="../kjv/gen036.htm#011">Gen 36:11</a>, <a href="../kjv/gen036.htm#016">Gen 36:16</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="006"><b>Elipheleh</b></a>     God will distinguish him, one of the porters appointed to play "on the Sheminith" on the occasion of the bringing up of the ark to the city of David (<a href="../kjv/ch1015.htm#018">Ch1 15:18</a>, <a href="../kjv/ch1015.htm#021">Ch1 15:21</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="007"><b>Eliphelet</b></a>     God his deliverance.     (1.) One of David's distinguished warriors (<a href="../kjv/sa2023.htm#034">Sa2 23:34</a>); called also Eliphal in <a href="../kjv/ch1011.htm#035">Ch1 11:35</a>. (2.) One of the sons of David born at Jerusalem (<a href="../kjv/ch1003.htm#006">Ch1 3:6</a>; <a href="../kjv/ch1014.htm#005">Ch1 14:5</a>); called Elpalet in <a href="../kjv/ch1014.htm#005">Ch1 14:5</a>. Also another of David's sons (<a href="../kjv/ch1003.htm#008">Ch1 3:8</a>); called Eliphalet in <a href="../kjv/sa2005.htm#016">Sa2 5:16</a>; <a href="../kjv/ch1014.htm#007">Ch1 14:7</a>. (3.) A descendant of king Saul through Jonathan (<a href="../kjv/ch1008.htm#039">Ch1 8:39</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="008"><b>Elisabeth</b></a>     God her oath, the mother of John the Baptist (<a href="../kjv/luk001.htm#005">Luk 1:5</a>). She was a descendant of Aaron. She and her husband Zacharias (q.v.) "were both righteous before God" (<a href="../kjv/luk001.htm#005">Luk 1:5</a>, <a href="../kjv/luk001.htm#013">Luk 1:13</a>). Mary's visit to Elisabeth is described in 1:39-63. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="009"><b>Elisha</b></a>     God his salvation, the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah, who became the attendant and disciple of Elijah (<a href="../kjv/kg1019.htm#016">Kg1 19:16</a>). His name first occurs in the command given to Elijah to anoint him as his successor (<a href="../kjv/kg1019.htm#016">Kg1 19:16</a>). This was the only one of the three commands then given to Elijah which he accomplished. On his way from Sinai to Damascus he found Elisha at his native place engaged in the labours of the field, ploughing with twelve yoke of oxen. He went over to him, threw over his shoulders his rough mantle, and at once adopted him as a son, and invested him with the prophetical office (compare <a href="../kjv/luk009.htm#061">Luk 9:61</a>, <a href="../kjv/luk009.htm#062">Luk 9:62</a>). Elisha accepted the call thus given (about four years before the death of Ahab), and for some seven or eight years became the close attendant on Elijah till he was parted from him and taken up into heaven. During all these years we hear nothing of Elisha except in connection with the closing scenes of Elijah's life. After Elijah, Elisha was accepted as the leader of the sons of the prophets, and became noted in Israel. He possessed, according to his own request, "a double portion" of Elijah's spirit (<a href="../kjv/kg2002.htm#009">Kg2 2:9</a>); and for the long period of about sixty years (892-832 B.C.) held the office of "prophet in Israel" (<a href="../kjv/kg2005.htm#008">Kg2 5:8</a>). After Elijah's departure, Elisha returned to Jericho, and there healed the spring of water by casting salt into it (<a href="../kjv/kg2002.htm#021">Kg2 2:21</a>). We next find him at Bethel (<a href="../kjv/kg2002.htm#023">Kg2 2:23</a>), where, with the sternest of his master, he cursed the youths who came out and scoffed at him as a prophet of God: "Go up, thou bald head." The judgment at once took effect, and God terribly visited the dishonour done to his prophet as dishonour done to himself. We next read of his predicting a fall of rain when the army of Jehoram was faint from thirst (<a href="../kjv/kg2003.htm#009">Kg2 3:9</a>); of the multiplying of the poor widow's cruse of oil (<a href="../kjv/kg2004.htm#001">Kg2 4:1</a>); the miracle of restoring to life the son of the woman of Shunem (2 Kings 4:18-37); the multiplication of the twenty loaves of new barley into a sufficient supply for an hundred men (<a href="../kjv/kg2004.htm#042">Kg2 4:42</a>); of the cure of Naaman the Syrian of his leprosy (2 Kings 5:1-27); of the punishment of Gehazi for his falsehood and his covetousness; of the recovery of the axe lost in the waters of the Jordan (<a href="../kjv/kg2006.htm#001">Kg2 6:1</a>); of the miracle at Dothan, half-way on the road between Samaria and Jezreel; of the siege of Samaria by the king of Syria, and of the terrible sufferings of the people in connection with it, and Elisha's prophecy as to the relief that would come (2 Kings 6:24-7:2). We then find Elisha at Damascus, to carry out the command given to his master to anoint Hazael king over Syria (<a href="../kjv/kg2008.htm#007">Kg2 8:7</a>); thereafter he directs one of the sons of the prophets to anoint Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat, king of Israel, instead of Ahab. Thus the three commands given to Elijah (<a href="../kjv/kg2009.htm#001">Kg2 9:1</a>) were at length carried out. We do not again read of him till we find him on his death-bed in his own house (<a href="../kjv/kg2013.htm#014">Kg2 13:14</a>). Joash, the grandson of Jehu, comes to mourn over his approaching departure, and utters the same words as those of Elisha when Elijah was taken away: "My father, my father! the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof." Afterwards when a dead body is laid in Elisha's grave a year after his burial, no sooner does it touch the hallowed remains than the man "revived, and stood up on his feet" (<a href="../kjv/kg2013.htm#020">Kg2 13:20</a>).
