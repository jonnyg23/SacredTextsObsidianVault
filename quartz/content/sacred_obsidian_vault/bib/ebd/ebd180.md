 <p><a name="000"><b>Hobab</b></a>     Beloved, the Kenite, has been usually identified with Jethro (q.v.), <a href="../kjv/exo018.htm#005">Exo 18:5</a>, <a href="../kjv/exo018.htm#027">Exo 18:27</a>; compare <a href="../kjv/num010.htm#029">Num 10:29</a>, <a href="../kjv/num010.htm#030">Num 10:30</a>. In <a href="../kjv/jdg004.htm#011">Jdg 4:11</a>, the word rendered "father-in-law" means properly any male relative by marriage (compare <a href="../kjv/gen019.htm#014">Gen 19:14</a>, "son-in-law," A.V.), and should be rendered "brother-in-law," as in the R.V. His descendants followed Israel to Canaan (<a href="../kjv/num010.htm#029">Num 10:29</a>), and at first pitched their tents near Jericho, but afterwards settled in the south in the borders of Arad (<a href="../kjv/jdg001.htm#008">Jdg 1:8</a>, <a href="../kjv/jdg001.htm#016">Jdg 1:16</a>).

 <p><a name="001"><b>Hobah</b></a>     Hiding-place, a place to the north of Damascus, to which Abraham pursued Chedorlaomer and his confederates (<a href="../kjv/gen014.htm#015">Gen 14:15</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="002"><b>Hodijah</b></a>     Majesty of Jehovah.     (1.) One of the Levites who assisted Ezra in expounding the law (<a href="../kjv/neh008.htm#007">Neh 8:7</a>; <a href="../kjv/neh009.htm#005">Neh 9:5</a>). (2.) <a href="../kjv/neh010.htm#018">Neh 10:18</a>, a Levite who sealed the covenant. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="003"><b>Hoglah</b></a>     Partridge, one of the daughters of Zelophehad the Gileadite, to whom portions were assigned by Moses (<a href="../kjv/num026.htm#033">Num 26:33</a>; <a href="../kjv/num027.htm#001">Num 27:1</a>; <a href="../kjv/num036.htm#011">Num 36:11</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="004"><b>Hoham</b></a>     Jehovah impels, the king of Hebron who joined the league against Gibeon. He and his allies were defeated (<a href="../kjv/jos010.htm#003">Jos 10:3</a>, <a href="../kjv/jos010.htm#005">Jos 10:5</a>, <a href="../kjv/jos010.htm#016">Jos 10:16</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="005"><b>Hold</b></a>     A fortress, the name given to David's lurking-places (<a href="../kjv/sa1022.htm#004">Sa1 22:4</a>, <a href="../kjv/sa1022.htm#005">Sa1 22:5</a>; <a href="../kjv/sa1024.htm#022">Sa1 24:22</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="006"><b>Holiness</b></a>     In the highest sense belongs to God (<a href="../kjv/isa006.htm#003">Isa 6:3</a>; <a href="../kjv/rev015.htm#004">Rev 15:4</a>), and to Christians as consecrated to God's service, and in so far as they are conformed in all things to the will of God (<a href="../kjv/rom006.htm#019">Rom 6:19</a>, <a href="../kjv/rom006.htm#022">Rom 6:22</a>; <a href="../kjv/eph001.htm#004">Eph 1:4</a>; <a href="../kjv/tit001.htm#008">Tit 1:8</a>; <a href="../kjv/pe1001.htm#015">Pe1 1:15</a>). Personal holiness is a work of gradual development. It is carried on under many hindrances, hence the frequent admonitions to watchfulness, prayer, and perseverance (<a href="../kjv/co1001.htm#030">Co1 1:30</a>; <a href="../kjv/co2007.htm#001">Co2 7:1</a>; <a href="../kjv/eph004.htm#023">Eph 4:23</a>, <a href="../kjv/eph004.htm#024">Eph 4:24</a>). (See SANCTIFICATION.) 
 </p>
 <p><a name="007"><b>Holy Ghost</b></a>     The third Person of the adorable Trinity. His personality is proved     (1.) from the fact that the attributes of personality, as intelligence and volition, are ascribed to him (<a href="../kjv/joh014.htm#017">Joh 14:17</a>, <a href="../kjv/joh014.htm#026">Joh 14:26</a>; <a href="../kjv/joh015.htm#026">Joh 15:26</a>; <a href="../kjv/co1002.htm#010">Co1 2:10</a>, <a href="../kjv/co1002.htm#011">Co1 2:11</a>; <a href="../kjv/co1012.htm#011">Co1 12:11</a>). He reproves, helps, glorifies, intercedes (<a href="../kjv/joh016.htm#007">Joh 16:7</a>; <a href="../kjv/rom008.htm#026">Rom 8:26</a>). (2.) He executes the offices peculiar only to a person. The very nature of these offices involves personal distinction (<a href="../kjv/luk012.htm#012">Luk 12:12</a>; <a href="../kjv/act005.htm#032">Act 5:32</a>; <a href="../kjv/act015.htm#028">Act 15:28</a>; <a href="../kjv/act016.htm#006">Act 16:6</a>; <a href="../kjv/act028.htm#025">Act 28:25</a>; <a href="../kjv/co1002.htm#013">Co1 2:13</a>; <a href="../kjv/heb002.htm#004">Heb 2:4</a>; <a href="../kjv/heb003.htm#007">Heb 3:7</a>; <a href="../kjv/pe2001.htm#021">Pe2 1:21</a>).    His divinity is established     (1.) from the fact that the names of God are ascribed to him (<a href="../kjv/exo017.htm#007">Exo 17:7</a>; <a href="../kjv/psa095.htm#007">Psa 95:7</a>; compare <a href="../kjv/heb003.htm#007">Heb 3:7</a>); and (2.) that divine attributes are also ascribed to him, omnipresence (<a href="../kjv/psa139.htm#007">Psa 139:7</a>; <a href="../kjv/eph002.htm#017">Eph 2:17</a>, <a href="../kjv/eph002.htm#018">Eph 2:18</a>; <a href="../kjv/co1012.htm#013">Co1 12:13</a>); omniscience (<a href="../kjv/co1002.htm#010">Co1 2:10</a>, <a href="../kjv/co1002.htm#011">Co1 2:11</a>); omnipotence (<a href="../kjv/luk001.htm#035">Luk 1:35</a>; <a href="../kjv/rom008.htm#011">Rom 8:11</a>); eternity (<a href="../kjv/heb009.htm#004">Heb 9:4</a>). (3.) Creation is ascribed to him (<a href="../kjv/gen001.htm#002">Gen 1:2</a>; <a href="../kjv/job026.htm#013">Job 26:13</a>; <a href="../kjv/psa104.htm#030">Psa 104:30</a>), and the working of miracles (<a href="../kjv/mat012.htm#028">Mat 12:28</a>; <a href="../kjv/co1012.htm#009">Co1 12:9</a>). (4.) Worship is required and ascribed to him (<a href="../kjv/isa006.htm#003">Isa 6:3</a>; <a href="../kjv/act028.htm#025">Act 28:25</a>; <a href="../kjv/rom009.htm#001">Rom 9:1</a>; <a href="../kjv/rev001.htm#004">Rev 1:4</a>; <a href="../kjv/mat028.htm#019">Mat 28:19</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="008"><b>Holy Place</b></a>     One of the two portions into which the tabernacle was divided (<a href="../kjv/exo026.htm#031">Exo 26:31</a>; <a href="../kjv/exo037.htm#017">Exo 37:17</a>; <a href="../kjv/heb009.htm#002">Heb 9:2</a>). It was 20 cubits long and 10 in height and breadth. It was illuminated by the golden candlestick, as it had no opening to admit the light. It contained the table of show-bread (<a href="../kjv/exo025.htm#023">Exo 25:23</a>) and the golden altar of incense (<a href="../kjv/exo030.htm#001">Exo 30:1</a>). It was divided from the holy of holies by a veil of the most costly materials and the brightest colours. The arrangement of the temple (q.v.) was the same in this respect. In it the walls of hewn stone were wainscoted with cedar and overlaid with gold, and adorned with beautiful carvings. It was entered from the porch by folding doors overlaid with gold and richly embossed. Outside the holy place stood the great tank or "sea" of molten brass, supported by twelve oxen, three turned each way, capable of containing two thousand baths of water. Besides this there were ten lavers and the brazen altar of burnt sacrifice. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="009"><b>Holy of Holies</b></a>     The second or interior portion of the tabernacle. It was left in total darkness. No one was permitted to enter it except [the high priest, and that only once a year. It contained the ark of the covenant only (<a href="../kjv/exo025.htm#010">Exo 25:10</a>). It was in the form of a perfect cube of 20 cubits. (See TABERNACLE.)
