It is found in several places in the plural BAALIM (<a href="../kjv/jdg002.htm#011">Jdg 2:11</a>; <a href="../kjv/jdg010.htm#010">Jdg 10:10</a>; <a href="../kjv/kg1018.htm#018">Kg1 18:18</a>; <a href="../kjv/jer002.htm#023">Jer 2:23</a>; <a href="../kjv/hos002.htm#017">Hos 2:17</a>). Baal is identified with Molech (<a href="../kjv/jer019.htm#005">Jer 19:5</a>). It was known to the Israelites as Baal-peor (<a href="../kjv/num025.htm#003">Num 25:3</a>; <a href="../kjv/deu004.htm#003">Deu 4:3</a>), was worshipped till the time of Samuel (<a href="../kjv/sa1007.htm#004">Sa1 7:4</a>), and was afterwards the religion of the ten tribes in the time of Ahab (<a href="../kjv/kg1016.htm#031">Kg1 16:31</a>; <a href="../kjv/kg1018.htm#019">Kg1 18:19</a>, <a href="../kjv/kg1018.htm#022">Kg1 18:22</a>).

The priests of Baal were in great numbers (<a href="../kjv/kg1018.htm#019">Kg1 18:19</a>), and of various classes (<a href="../kjv/kg2010.htm#019">Kg2 10:19</a>). Their mode of offering sacrifices is described in <a href="../kjv/kg1018.htm#025">Kg1 18:25</a>. The sun-god, under the general title of Baal, or "lord," was the chief object of worship of the Canaanites. Each locality had its special Baal, and the various local Baals were summed up under the name of Baalim, or "lords." Each Baal had a wife, who was a colourless reflection of himself. (2.)
