 </p>
 <p><a name="002"><b>Rakkon</b></a>     A place upon the shore, a town belonging to Dan (<a href="../kjv/jos019.htm#046">Jos 19:46</a>). It is now Tell er-Rakkeit, 6 miles north of Joppa, on the sea-shore, near the mouth of the river  'Aujeh , i.e., "yellow water." (See KANAH.) 
 </p>
 <p><a name="003"><b>Ram</b></a>     Exalted.     (1.) The son of Hezron, and one of the ancestors of the royal line (<a href="../kjv/rut004.htm#019">Rut 4:19</a>). The margin of <a href="../kjv/ch1002.htm#009">Ch1 2:9</a>, also <a href="../kjv/mat001.htm#003">Mat 1:3</a>, <a href="../kjv/mat001.htm#004">Mat 1:4</a> and <a href="../kjv/luk003.htm#033">Luk 3:33</a>, have "Aram." (2.) One of the sons of Jerahmeel (<a href="../kjv/ch1002.htm#025">Ch1 2:25</a>, <a href="../kjv/ch1002.htm#027">Ch1 2:27</a>). (3.) A person mentioned in <a href="../kjv/job032.htm#002">Job 32:2</a> as founder of a clan to which Elihu belonged. The same as Aram of <a href="../kjv/gen022.htm#021">Gen 22:21</a>.

 <p><a name="004"><b>Rama</b></a>     (<a href="../kjv/mat002.htm#018">Mat 2:18</a>), the Greek form of 
 </p>
 <p><a name="005"><b>Ramah</b></a>      (1.) A city first mentioned in <a href="../kjv/jos018.htm#025">Jos 18:25</a>, near Gibeah of Benjamin. It was fortified by Baasha, king of Israel (<a href="../kjv/kg1015.htm#017">Kg1 15:17</a>; <a href="../kjv/ch2016.htm#001">Ch2 16:1</a>). Asa, king of Judah, employed Benhadad the Syrian king to drive Baasha from this city (<a href="../kjv/kg1015.htm#018">Kg1 15:18</a>, <a href="../kjv/kg1015.htm#020">Kg1 15:20</a>). Isaiah (<a href="../kjv/isa010.htm#029">Isa 10:29</a>) refers to it, and also Jeremiah, who was once a prisoner there among the other captives of Jerusalem when it was taken by Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="../kjv/jer039.htm#008">Jer 39:8</a>; <a href="../kjv/jer040.htm#001">Jer 40:1</a>). Rachel, whose tomb lies close to Bethlehem, is represented as weeping in Ramah (<a href="../kjv/jer031.htm#015">Jer 31:15</a>) for her slaughtered children. This prophecy is illustrated and fulfilled in the re-awakening of Rachel's grief at the slaughter of the infants in Bethlehem (<a href="../kjv/mat002.htm#018">Mat 2:18</a>). It is identified with the modern village of er-Ram, between Gibeon and Beeroth, about 5 miles due north of Jerusalem. (See SAMUEL.) (2.) A town identified with Rameh, on the border of Asher, about 13 miles south-east of Tyre, "on a solitary hill in the midst of a basin of green fields" (<a href="../kjv/jos019.htm#029">Jos 19:29</a>). (3.) One of the "fenced cities" of Naphtali (<a href="../kjv/jos019.htm#036">Jos 19:36</a>), on a mountain slope, about seven and a half miles west-south-west of Safed, and 15 miles west of the north end of the Sea of Galilee, the present large and well-built village of Rameh. (4.) The same as Ramathaim-zophim (q.v.), a town of Mount Ephraim (<a href="../kjv/sa1001.htm#001">Sa1 1:1</a>, <a href="../kjv/sa1001.htm#019">Sa1 1:19</a>). (5.) The same as Ramoth-gilead (q.v.), <a href="../kjv/kg2008.htm#029">Kg2 8:29</a>; <a href="../kjv/ch2022.htm#006">Ch2 22:6</a>. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="006"><b>Ramathaim-zophim</b></a>     The two heights of the Zophites or of the watchers (only in <a href="../kjv/sa1001.htm#001">Sa1 1:1</a>), "in the land of Zuph" (<a href="../kjv/sa1009.htm#005">Sa1 9:5</a>). Ramathaim is another name for Ramah (4). One of the Levitical families descended from Kohath, that of Zuph or Zophai (<a href="../kjv/ch1006.htm#026">Ch1 6:26</a>, <a href="../kjv/ch1006.htm#035">Ch1 6:35</a>), had a district assigned to them in Ephraim, which from this circumstance was called "the land of Zuph," and hence the name of the town, "Zophim." It was the birth-place of Samuel and the seat of his authority (<a href="../kjv/sa1002.htm#011">Sa1 2:11</a>; <a href="../kjv/sa1007.htm#017">Sa1 7:17</a>). It is frequently mentioned in the history of that prophet and of David (<a href="../kjv/sa1015.htm#034">Sa1 15:34</a>; <a href="../kjv/sa1016.htm#013">Sa1 16:13</a>; <a href="../kjv/sa1019.htm#018">Sa1 19:18</a>). Here Samuel died and was buried (<a href="../kjv/sa1025.htm#001">Sa1 25:1</a>). This town has been identified with the modern Neby Samwil ("the prophet Samuel"), about 4 or 5 miles north-west of Jerusalem. But there is no certainty as to its precise locality. Some have supposed that it may be identical with Arimathea of the New Testament. (See MIZPAH).

 <p><a name="007"><b>Ramath-lehi</b></a>     Elevation of Lehi, or the jawbone height; i.e., the Ramah of Lehi (<a href="../kjv/jdg015.htm#015">Jdg 15:15</a>). The phrase "in the jaw," <a href="../kjv/jdg015.htm#019">Jdg 15:19</a>, Authorized Version, is in the margin, also in the Revised Version, "in Lehi." Here Samson slew a thousand Philistines with a jawbone. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="008"><b>Ramath-mizpeh</b></a>     The height of Mizpeh or of the watch-tower (<a href="../kjv/jos013.htm#026">Jos 13:26</a>), a place mentioned as one of the limits of Gad. There were two Mizpehs on the east of the Jordan. This was the Mizpeh where Jacob and Laban made a covenant, "Mizpeh of Gilead," called also Galeed and Jegar-sahadutha. It has been identified with the modern es-Salt, where the roads from Jericho and from Shechem to Damascus unite, about 25 miles east of the Jordan and 13 south of the Jabbok. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="009"><b>Ramath of the South</b></a>     (Heb.  Ramathnegeb ). The Heb.  negeb  is the general designation for south or south-west of Judah. This was one of the towns of Simeon (<a href="../kjv/jos019.htm#008">Jos 19:8</a>). It is the same as "south Ramoth" (<a href="../kjv/sa1030.htm#027">Sa1 30:27</a>; R.V., "Ramoth of the south"). Its site is doubtful. Some have thought it another name for Baalath-beer.
