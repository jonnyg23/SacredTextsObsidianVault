 <p><a name="000"><b>Rithmah</b></a>     Wild broom, a station in the wilderness (<a href="../kjv/num033.htm#018">Num 33:18</a>, <a href="../kjv/num033.htm#019">Num 33:19</a>), the "broom valley," or "valley of broom bushes," the place apparently of the original encampment of Israel, near Kadesh.

 <p><a name="001"><b>River</b></a>      (1.) Heb.  'aphik , properly the channel or ravine that holds water (<a href="../kjv/sa2022.htm#016">Sa2 22:16</a>), translated "brook," "river," "stream," but not necessarily a perennial stream (<a href="../kjv/eze006.htm#003">Eze 6:3</a>; <a href="../kjv/eze031.htm#012">Eze 31:12</a>; <a href="../kjv/eze032.htm#006">Eze 32:6</a>; <a href="../kjv/eze034.htm#013">Eze 34:13</a>). (2.) Heb.  nahal , in winter a "torrent," in summer a "wady" or valley (<a href="../kjv/gen032.htm#023">Gen 32:23</a>; <a href="../kjv/deu002.htm#024">Deu 2:24</a>; <a href="../kjv/deu003.htm#016">Deu 3:16</a>; <a href="../kjv/isa030.htm#028">Isa 30:28</a>; <a href="../kjv/lam002.htm#018">Lam 2:18</a>; <a href="../kjv/eze047.htm#009">Eze 47:9</a>).    These winter torrents sometimes come down with great suddenness and with desolating force. A distinguished traveler thus describes his experience in this matter:, "I was encamped in Wady  Feiran , near the base of Jebel Serbal, when a tremendous thunderstorm burst upon us. After little more than an hour's rain, the water rose so rapidly in the previously dry wady that I had to run for my life, and with great difficulty succeeded in saving my tent and goods; my boots, which I had not time to pick up, were washed away. In less than two hours a dry desert wady upwards of 300 yards broad was turned into a foaming torrent from 8 to 10 feet deep, roaring and tearing down and bearing everything upon it, tangled masses of tamarisks, hundreds of beautiful palm trees, scores of sheep and goats, camels and donkeys, and even men, women, and children, for a whole encampment of Arabs was washed away a few miles above me. The storm commenced at five in the evening; at half-past nine the waters were rapidly subsiding, and it was evident that the flood had spent its force." (Compare <a href="../kjv/mat007.htm#027">Mat 7:27</a>; <a href="../kjv/luk006.htm#049">Luk 6:49</a>.)     (3.)  Nahar , a "river" continuous and full, a perennial stream, as the Jordan, the Euphrates (<a href="../kjv/gen002.htm#010">Gen 2:10</a>; <a href="../kjv/gen015.htm#018">Gen 15:18</a>; <a href="../kjv/deu001.htm#007">Deu 1:7</a>; <a href="../kjv/psa066.htm#006">Psa 66:6</a>; <a href="../kjv/eze010.htm#015">Eze 10:15</a>). (4.)  Tel'alah , a conduit, or water-course (<a href="../kjv/kg1018.htm#032">Kg1 18:32</a>; <a href="../kjv/kg2018.htm#017">Kg2 18:17</a>; <a href="../kjv/kg2020.htm#020">Kg2 20:20</a>; <a href="../kjv/job038.htm#025">Job 38:25</a>; <a href="../kjv/eze031.htm#004">Eze 31:4</a>). (5.)  Peleg , properly "waters divided", i.e., streams divided, throughout the land (<a href="../kjv/psa001.htm#003">Psa 1:3</a>); "the rivers [i.e., 'divisions'] of waters" (<a href="../kjv/job020.htm#017">Job 20:17</a>; <a href="../kjv/job029.htm#006">Job 29:6</a>; <a href="../kjv/pro005.htm#016">Pro 5:16</a>). (6.)  Ye'or , i.e., "great river", probably from an Egyptian word ( Aur ), commonly applied to the Nile (<a href="../kjv/gen041.htm#001">Gen 41:1</a>), but also to other rivers (<a href="../kjv/job028.htm#010">Job 28:10</a>; <a href="../kjv/isa033.htm#021">Isa 33:21</a>). (7.)  Yubhal , "a river" (<a href="../kjv/jer017.htm#008">Jer 17:8</a>), a full flowing stream. (8.)  'Ubhal , "a river" (<a href="../kjv/dan008.htm#002">Dan 8:2</a>).

 <p><a name="002"><b>River of Egypt</b></a>      (1.) Heb.  nahar   mitsraim , denotes in <a href="../kjv/gen015.htm#018">Gen 15:18</a> the Nile, or its eastern branch (<a href="../kjv/ch2009.htm#026">Ch2 9:26</a>). (2.) In <a href="../kjv/num034.htm#005">Num 34:5</a> (R.V., "brook of Egypt") the Hebrew word is nahal, denoting a stream flowing rapidly in winter, or in the rainy season. This is a desert stream on the borders of Egypt. It is now called the Wady  el-'Arish . The present boundary between Egypt and Palestine is about midway between this wady and Gaza. (See <a href="../kjv/num034.htm#005">Num 34:5</a>; <a href="../kjv/jos015.htm#004">Jos 15:4</a>, <a href="../kjv/jos015.htm#047">Jos 15:47</a>; <a href="../kjv/kg1008.htm#065">Kg1 8:65</a>; <a href="../kjv/kg2024.htm#007">Kg2 24:7</a>; <a href="../kjv/isa027.htm#012">Isa 27:12</a>; <a href="../kjv/eze047.htm#019">Eze 47:19</a>. In all these passages the R.V. has "brook" and the A.V. "river.") 
 </p>
 <p><a name="003"><b>River of Gad</b></a>     Probably the Arno (<a href="../kjv/sa2024.htm#005">Sa2 24:5</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="004"><b>River of God</b></a>     (<a href="../kjv/psa065.htm#009">Psa 65:9</a>), as opposed to earthly streams, denoting that the divine resources are inexhaustible, or the sum of all fertilizing streams that water the earth (<a href="../kjv/gen002.htm#010">Gen 2:10</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="005"><b>Rivers of Babylon</b></a>     (<a href="../kjv/psa137.htm#001">Psa 137:1</a>), i.e., of the whole country of Babylonia, e.g., the Tigris, Euphrates, Chalonas, the Ulai, and the numerous canals. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="006"><b>Rivers of Damascus</b></a>     The Abana and Pharpar (<a href="../kjv/kg2005.htm#012">Kg2 5:12</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="007"><b>Rivers of Judah</b></a>     (<a href="../kjv/joe003.htm#018">Joe 3:18</a>), the watercourses of Judea. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="008"><b>Rizpah</b></a>     Coal; hot stone, the daughter of Aiah, and one of Saul's concubines. She was the mother of Armoni and Mephibosheth (<a href="../kjv/sa2003.htm#007">Sa2 3:7</a>; <a href="../kjv/sa2021.htm#008">Sa2 21:8</a>, <a href="../kjv/sa2021.htm#010">Sa2 21:10</a>, <a href="../kjv/sa2021.htm#011">Sa2 21:11</a>). It happened that a grievous famine, which lasted for three years, fell upon the land during the earlier half of David's reign at Jerusalem. This calamity was sent "for Saul and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites." David inquired of the Gibeonites what satisfaction they demanded, and was answered that nothing would compensate for the wrong Saul had done to them but the death of seven of Saul's sons. David accordingly delivered up to them the two sons of Rizpah and five of the sons of Merab (q.v.), Saul's eldest daughter, whom she bore to Adriel. These the Gibeonites put to death, and hung up their bodies before the Lord at the sanctuary at Gibeah. Rizpah thereupon took her place on the rock of Gibeah (q.v.), and for five months watched the suspended bodies of her children, to prevent them from being devoured by the beasts and birds of prey, till they were at length taken down and buried by David. Her marriage to Abner was the occasion of a quarrel between him and Ishbosheth, which led to Abner's going over to the side of David (<a href="../kjv/sa2003.htm#017">Sa2 3:17</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="009"><b>Road</b></a>     (<a href="../kjv/sa1027.htm#010">Sa1 27:10</a>; R.V., "raid"), an inroad, an incursion. This word is never used in Scripture in the sense of a way or path.
