A daughter of David (2 Sam. 13:1-32; <a href="../kjv/ch1003.htm#009">Ch1 3:9</a>), whom Amnon shamefully outraged and afterwards "hated exceedingly," thereby illustrating the law of human nature noticed even by the heathen, "Proprium humani ingenii est odisse quem laeseris", i.e., "It is the property of human nature to hate one whom you have injured."

Hist.).
