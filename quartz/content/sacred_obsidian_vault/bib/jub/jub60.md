For he told them how he had seen everything in a dream, even all that He had spoken unto him that he should return to his father's house; and they said: "To every place whither thou goest we will go with thee." 4.

And Laban pursued after him and overtook Jacob in the mountain of Gilead in the third month, on the thirteenth thereof. 6.

And he made there a heap for a witness; wherefore the name of that place is called: "The Heap of Witness," after this heap. <a name="fr_693"></a><a href="#fn_691"><font size="1">2</font></a> 9.
