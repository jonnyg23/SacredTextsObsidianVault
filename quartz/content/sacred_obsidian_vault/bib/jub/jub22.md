And he called his sons, and they drew nigh to him, they and their children, and he divided the earth into the lots, which his three sons were to take in possession, and they reached forth their hands, and took the writing out of the bosom of Noah, their father. 12. And there came forth on the writing as Shem's lot <a name="fr_290"></a><a href="#fn_290"><font size="1">2</font></a> the middle of the earth <a name="fr_291"></a><a href="#fn_291"><font size="1">3</font></a> which he should take as an inheritance for himself and for his sons for the generations of eternity, from the middle of the mountain range of Râfâ, <a name="fr_292"></a><a href="#fn_292"><font size="1">4</font></a> from the mouth of the water from the river Tînâ. <a name="fr_293"></a><a href="#fn_293"><font size="1">5</font></a> and his portion goeth towards the west through the midst of this river, and it extendeth till it reacheth the water of the abysses, out of which this river goeth forth and poureth its waters into the sea Mêat, <a name="fr_294"></a><a href="#fn_294"><font size="1">6</font></a> and this river floweth into the great sea. And all that is towards the north is Japheth's, and all that is towards the south belongeth to Shem. 13. And it extendeth till it reacheth Kârâsô: <a name="fr_295"></a><a href="#fn_295"><font size="1">7</font></a> this is in the bosom of the tongue <a name="fr_296"></a><a href="#fn_296"><font size="1">8</font></a> which looketh towards the south. 14.
