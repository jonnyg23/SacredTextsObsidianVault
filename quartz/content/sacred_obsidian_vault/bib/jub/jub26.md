 <p>28. And Ham and his sons went into the land which he was to occupy, which he acquired as his portion in the land of the south. <a name="fr_366"></a><a href="#fn_366"><font size="1">1</font></a> 29. And Canaan saw the land of Lebanon to the river of Egypt that it was very good, and he went not into the land of his inheritance to the west (that is to) the sea, <a name="fr_367"></a><a href="#fn_367"><font size="1">2</font></a> and he dwelt in the land of Lebanon, eastward and westward from the border of Jordan and from the border of the sea. <a name="fr_368"></a><a href="#fn_368"><font size="1">3</font></a> 30. And Ham, his father, and Cush and Mizraim, his brothers, said unto him: "Thou hast settled in a land which. is not thine, and which did not fall to us by lot: do not do so; for if thou dost do so, thou and thy sons will fall in the land and (be) accursed through sedition; for by sedition ye have settled, and by sedition will thy children fall, and thou shalt be rooted out for ever. 31. Dwell not in the dwelling of Shem; for to Shem and to his sons did it come by their lot. 32. Cursed art thou, and cursed shalt thou be beyond all the sons of Noah, by the curse <a name="fr_369"></a><a href="#fn_369"><font size="1">4</font></a> by which we bound ourselves by an oath in the presence of the holy judge, <a name="fr_370"></a><a href="#fn_370"><font size="1">5</font></a> and in the presence of Noah our father." 33. But he did not hearken unto them, and dwelt in the land of Lebanon from Hamath <a name="fr_371"></a><a href="#fn_371"><font size="1">6</font></a> to the entering of Egypt, <a name="fr_372"></a><a href="#fn_372"><font size="1">7</font></a> he and his sons until this day. 34. And for this reason that land is named Canaan. 35. And Japheth and his sons went towards the sea and dwelt in the land of their portion, and Madai saw the land of the sea and it did not please him, and he begged a (portion) from Elam and Asshur and Arpachshad,</p>
