   <h3 align="center">Laws regarding the Jubilees and the Sabbath (l. 1-13).</h3>  
 <p>L. And after this law I made known to thee the days of the Sabbaths in the desert of Sin[ai], which is between Elim and Sinai. <a name="fr_937"></a><a href="#fn_929"><font size="1">5</font></a> 2. And I told thee of the Sabbaths of the land on Mount Sinai, and I told thee of the jubilee years <a name="fr_938"></a><a href="#fn_930"><font size="1">6</font></a> in the sabbaths of years: but the year thereof have I not told thee till ye enter the land which ye are to possess. 3. And the land also will keep its sabbaths while they dwell upon it, <a name="fr_939"></a><a href="#fn_931"><font size="1">7</font></a> and they will know the jubilee year. 4. Wherefore I have ordained for thee the year-weeks <a name="fr_940"></a><a href="#fn_932"><font size="1">8</font></a> and the years and the jubilees: there are forty-nine jubilees from the days of Adam until this day, and one week </p><table align="RIGHT" width="10%" cellpadding="8">

 <p>the Lord, until they pass over into the land of Canaan, crossing the Jordan to the west. 5. And the jubilees will pass by, until Israel is cleansed from all guilt of fornication, and uncleanness, and pollution, and sin, and error, and dwelleth with confidence in all the land, and there will be no more a Satan or any evil one, and the land will be clean from that time for evermore. <a name="fr_941"></a><a href="#fn_933"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>6. And behold the commandment regarding the Sabbaths--I have written (them) down for thee and all the judgments of its laws. 7. Six days wilt thou labour, but on the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God. <a name="fr_942"></a><a href="#fn_934"><font size="1">2</font></a> In it ye shall do no manner of work, ye and your sons, and your men-servants and your maid-servants, and all your cattle and the sojourner also who is with you. 8. And the man that doeth any work on it shall die: <a name="fr_943"></a><a href="#fn_935"><font size="1">3</font></a> whoever desecrateth that day, whoever lieth with (his) wife <a name="fr_944"></a><a href="#fn_936"><font size="1">4</font></a> or whoever saith he will do something on it, that he will set out on a journey thereon <a name="fr_945"></a><a href="#fn_937"><font size="1">5</font></a> in regard to any buying or selling: <a name="fr_946"></a><a href="#fn_938"><font size="1">6</font></a> and whoever draweth water thereon <a name="fr_947"></a><a href="#fn_939"><font size="1">7</font></a> which he had not prepared for himself on the sixth day, and whoever taketh up any burden to carry it out of his tent <a name="fr_948"></a><a href="#fn_940"><font size="1">8</font></a> or out of his house shall die. 9. Ye shall do no work whatever on the Sabbath day save that ye have prepared for yourselves on the sixth day, so as to eat, and drink, and rest, and keep Sabbath from all work on that day, and to bless the Lord your God, who has given you a day of festival, and a holy day: and a day of the holy kingdom for all Israel is this day among their days for ever. 10.

 <p>honour which the Lord hath given to Israel that they should eat and drink and be satisfied on this festival day, and rest thereon from all labour <a name="fr_949"></a><a href="#fn_941"><font size="1">1</font></a> which belongeth to the labour of the children of men, save burning frankincense and bringing oblations and sacrifices before the Lord for days and for Sabbaths. 11. This work alone shall be done on the Sabbath-days <a name="fr_950"></a><a href="#fn_942"><font size="1">2</font></a> in the sanctuary of the Lord your God; that they may atone for Israel with sacrifice continually from day to day for a memorial well-pleasing before the Lord, and that He may receive them always from day to day according as thou hast been commanded. 12. And every man who doeth any work thereon, or goeth a journey, or tilleth (his) farm, <a name="fr_951"></a><a href="#fn_943"><font size="1">3</font></a> whether in his house or any other place, <a name="fr_952"></a><a href="#fn_944"><font size="1">4</font></a> and whoever lighteth a fire, <a name="fr_953"></a><a href="#fn_945"><font size="1">5</font></a> or rideth on any beast, <a name="fr_954"></a><a href="#fn_946"><font size="1">6</font></a> or travelleth by ship on the sea, and whoever striketh or killeth anything, or slaughtereth <a name="fr_955"></a><a href="#fn_947"><font size="1">7</font></a> a beast or a bird, or whoever catcheth an animal or a bird or a fish, or whoever fasteth or maketh war on the Sabbaths: <a name="fr_956"></a><a href="#fn_948"><font size="1">8</font></a> 13. The man who doeth any of these things on the Sabbath shall die, so that the children of Israel shall observe the Sabbaths according to the commandments regarding the Sabbaths of the land, as it is written in the tables, which He gave into my hands that I should write out for thee the laws of the seasons, and the seasons according to the division of their days.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p>Herewith is completed the account of the division of the days.</p>
