 Published anonymously by Burr in pamphlet form,
 <cite>Self-Contradictions of the Bible</cite> was, and remains
 an essential reference work for Atheists, Biblical skeptics and doubters,
 as well as believers who want to know what the opposition is up to.
 It is a set of 144 thematically organized pairs of Bible quotations that
 for the most part, will immediately induce <i>cognitive dissonance</i> in some.
 You have been warned.
 </p>
 <p>
 Burr was not an academic: he was a newspaper reporter, an Atheist obviously,
 a supporter of Darwinism, but an amateur Bible scholar,
 and sometimes that shows in the selections.
 Not everything here is, frankly, a direct hit, and the relentless
 out-of-context quotes mirror how the text can be abused by its adherents.
 However, this is a working-class Atheist tract.
 It is not concerned with philosophical niceities.
 Rather, it is a playbook for use in actual battle.
 </p>
 <p>
 This is another one of those books which you'll either love or hate.
 Or perhaps you'll like <i>half</i> of it.
 It is strange that even in the midst of this critical broadside
 against the Bible, it is possible to enjoy
 the poetry and archaic wisdom of this text, and perhaps some of the mystery
 as well.
