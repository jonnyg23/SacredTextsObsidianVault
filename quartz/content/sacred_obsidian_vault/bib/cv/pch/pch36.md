 <p>Apart from definite revivals, the memory of human sacrifice is clearly stamped not only on the Passover but on the two other typical sacrificial feasts of the Jewsthe indeterminate sacrifice of the Red Heifer, loosely said to have been performed only eight times since Moses, and the annual sacrifice of a scape-goat on the Day of Atonement. In the case of the former, which was prescribed to take place on the Mount of Olives, the high-priest, his eldest son, and the <i>Messiah Milchama</i>the deputy High-Priest anointed for warwere all three anointed with holy oil, the mark of a cross being made with it on their foreheads. But further, in one of the two Talmudic accounts, "in anticipation of the performance of the rite, a pregnant woman was brought into one of the chambers of the temple, which was set apart for the purpose, and kept there till her child was born. The child so born was brought up within the sacred precincts, and protected from any chance of incurring ceremonial pollution. When the time for the rite arrived, this child was seated on a wooden litter borne by bullocks, and conducted to the fountain of Siloah. There the child descended, and drew water from the spring in an earthen vessel, bearing which, he was reconducted, as he came, to the Temple." <a name="fr_772"></a><a href="#fn_772"><font size="1">3</font></a> But by another account "pregnant <i>women</i>" were brought to Jerusalem, and placed in courts built on the rock, <i>with an excavation underneath</i>, and they and their children were there kept "for the use of the red heifer" <a name="fr_773"></a><a href="#fn_773"><font size="1">4</font></a> till the children were seven or eight years old, when they ceased to be held ceremonially pure. Here it becomes fairly clear that a regular supply of children-victims had anciently been provided for sacrifice, and that the heifer was the child's representative. Some trace of the knowledge is preserved in the Talmud, in the dubiously significant</p>

 <p>saying that "as the red heifer atones for sin so also does the death of the righteous atone for sin." <a name="fr_774"></a><a href="#fn_774"><font size="1">1</font></a> Being sacrificed with her face to, the south and her head to the west, <a name="fr_775"></a><a href="#fn_775"><font size="1">2</font></a> the heifer was presumably dedicated either to the setting or winter sun or to the Moon-Goddess. <a name="fr_776"></a><a href="#fn_776"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>  
 <p>By an equally clear clue in the ritual, we can reach the original character of the sacrifice of the scapegoat, which in its official form is clearly post-exilic. <a name="fr_777"></a><a href="#fn_777"><font size="1">4</font></a> In the preparation for that, the high-priest was removed from his own house to the council-chamber seven days in advance, and at the same time a <i>sagan</i> or deputy was appointed who should take his place in case of his being incapacitated. On the night before the day of sacrifice he was not allowed to eat meat, or to sleep, being watched by the younger priests. At that stage, "the elders of the great Sanhedrin handed him over to the seniors of the priestly order, who escorted him to the <i>upper chamber</i> of the house of Abtinas, <a name="fr_778"></a><a href="#fn_778"><font size="1">5</font></a> and there they swore him in, <i>and, after bidding him farewell</i>, departed. In administering the oath, they said: "My lord high-priest, we are ambassadors of the Sanhedrin; <i>thou art ambassador of the Sanhedrin, and our ambassador also</i>. We adjure thee, by Him who causes his name to dwell in this house, that thou deviate not from anything we have rehearsed to thee. Then they parted company, <i>both he and they weeping</i>." <a name="fr_779"></a><a href="#fn_779"><font size="1">6</font></a> An absurd Talmudic explanation is given for the weeping: "He wept because they suspected he was a Sadducee; and they wept <i>because the penalty or false suspicion is scourging</i>." <a name="fr_780"></a><a href="#fn_780"><font size="1">7</font></a> Whatever may have been the historical fact concealed by the last phrase, it is sufficiently clear that the rite was originally one of human sacrifice in which either the priest or his deputy, the <i>Sagan</i> or <i>Segan</i>, was put to death as</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> "ambassador" of the people to the God or Gods, <a name="fr_781"></a><a href="#fn_781"><font size="1">1</font></a> that is, as scapegoat for their sins. And in this Sagan we probably have the true interpretation of the Græcised term <i>Zoganes</i> <a name="fr_782"></a><a href="#fn_782"><font size="1">2</font></a> applied to the mock victim of the Sacæa. He was simply the deputy <a name="fr_783"></a><a href="#fn_783"><font size="1">3</font></a> of the originally due victim, the priest, who must thus have solved his personal problem at a very early date. <a name="fr_784"></a><a href="#fn_784"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>  
 <p>In all likelihood the Hebrews had practised some form of this rite long before the Captivity. And as regards the later practice we have a significant Talmudic clue, in the saying of Rabbi Eleazar that it is lawful to slay an <i>Amhaaretz</i> (one "ignorant of the law," rustic "pagan") on the Day of Atonement, even (?) when it falls on a Sabbath. There were discussions on the point, and it is explained that the victim must not be slain with a knife, as "that would necessitate a formal benediction; but to kill him by tearing his nostrils open no benediction is required." Another Rabbi chimes in that "Rabbi Yochanan has said that it is lawful to split up the Amhaaretz like a fish"; "and that from the neck too," adds yet another. <a name="fr_785"></a><a href="#fn_785"><font size="1">5</font></a> The date explains the proposition. Whether as a regular and sanctioned or as a sporadic practice, the sacrifice of a human victim on the Day of Atonement had in all likelihood been practised at or near Jerusalem both before and after the Return from the Captivity. <a name="fr_786"></a><a href="#fn_786"><font size="1">6</font></a></p>  
 <p>The modified sacrifice of the scapegoat, then, was but another variant of the primordial principle of human sacrifice or "sin-offering" for the good of the people, and is in many respects the complement of the Passover. The Passover victim was set apart on the tenth day of the civil New Year, which dated from spring; the Day of Atonement was the tenth day from the ecclesiastical</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> New Year, which, as we have seen, began in autumn. It is probable that the latter is the older of the two; but both hold their ground in reference to the sun's progress, the spring festival standing for his youth and waxing period, the autumn for his maturity and waning. That they had a common principle in the sacrifice of a pure victim appears from the detail that in both cases the victim before sacrifice is put in an "upper chamber," the idea being to provide that no contamination should arise from a grave beneath. <a name="fr_787"></a><a href="#fn_787"><font size="1">1</font></a> And both festivals, it is to be noted, could be celebrated apart from the Temple, the Passover being a domestic as well as a temple-feast, and the Day of Atonement being celebrated in Babylon as well as at Jerusalem. <a name="fr_788"></a><a href="#fn_788"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>  
 <p>It is important to note this circumstance in view of the theoretic universalism of the traditional rite of sacrifice, which even the Khonds declared to be for "mankind," and on which the Gentilising Christians founded their gospel. Jewish sacrifices were strictly national; but in their later contacts with other races they were constantly being attracted towards more cosmopolitan ideals. <a name="fr_789"></a><a href="#fn_789"><font size="1">3</font></a> It sufficed that they had as basis the communal idea, and that it was capable of development on popular lines. In the legend of the slaying of Saul's seven sons they preserved the belief (seen in force among the Moabites, and at the same time in Israel <a name="fr_790"></a><a href="#fn_790"><font size="1">4</font></a>) that a king's son, offered up by and for his father, was an irresistibly potent sacrifice; and among some sections of the Semitic race, as we have seen, there was current the myth preserved by Eusebius from Philo of Byblos, that Kronos, "whom the Phnicians call Israel," adorned his son called Ieoud, "the only," with emblems of royalty, and sacrificed him. The actuality of such a belief among the Phnicians is proved by the story of Maleus crucifying his only son, crowned and robed in purple, before the walls of Carthage, in order to conquer the city. <a name="fr_791"></a><a href="#fn_791"><font size="1">5</font></a> He was fulfilling an august rite. Always it is a typically divine or racial "father"Kronos, Israel, Abraham</p>

But though that also was clearly a substitution for a human sacrifice, the sacrifice of a red <i>heifer</i> was on the whole more likely to belong originally to a Goddess-cult, and in Egypt all she-calves were sacred to Isis (Herod. ii, 41). On the whole problem cp. Spencer, <i>De Legibus Hebræorum</i>, 1. ii, c. 15.</p>

All critics now place Leviticus in the Priestly Code; and ch. xvi is no exception. Cp. Driver, Introd. c. i, § 3; Kuenen, <i>The Hexateuch</i>, Eng. tr. pp. 86, 312; and the Kautzsch Bible. If Lev. xvi be pre-exilic, why is there no trace of it in Deuteronomy?</p>

 <p><a name="fn_780"></a><a href="pch36.htm#fr_780">159:7</a> Schwab seeks to make the passage more plausible by the rendering (p. 170) that he wept at being supposed capable of unfaithfulness to his instructions, they because of the painful necessity of adjuring him to be faithful. Hershon's translation is the more exact.</p>

Schürer, recognising no problem as to the special function of the <i>segan</i> in the sacrifice, decides that he must have been the στρατηγὸς τοῦ ἱεροῦ or "captain of the temple" (p. 258).

Strack, in his learned and valuable work on <i>The Jew and Human Sacrifice</i> (Eng. trans. 1909, p. 160), replying to the anti-Semitic ravings of Prof. Rohling, argues that the passage first above cited "is not to be taken literally, but is merely a proof of the fanatical hatred dividing those learned in the law from those ignorant of it," and offers as proof of his contention a saying of Rabbi Aqibâ on the same page of Tr. Pesachim "When I was an Amha-ārez, I said, 'Give me a learned man that I may bite him like an ass.'" The great mass of Dr. Strack's argument in his book is sound, and his refutation of the malignant rubbish of the anti-Semites is complete; but I can see no force in his reasoning here. He has ignored the comments (above cited) on the saying of Rabbi Eleazar, which exclude his solution.</p>

The meaning of the sentence is that the Israelites felt the king's sacrifice of his son must be efficacious, and so gave up the contest in despair. Compare the story (above, p. 126) of Hamilcar's sacrifice of his son. So in the story of the sacrifice of the sons of King Hiel as foundation-Gods for Jericho (Josh. vi, 26; 1 Kings xvi, 34) it is implied that a tremendous efficacy had accrued to the practice; and so again when Maleus has sacrificed his son on a high cross in regal attire he speedily takes Carthage (Justin, xviii, 7). Exactly the same principle is found among the Maoris of New Zealand. A war-chief on the verge of defeat "cut out the heart of his own son as an offering for victory," whereafter, making a desperate onset, he and his tribe triumphed: "the war-demon had much praise, and many men were eaten" (Old New Zealand, by a Pakeha Maori, ed. 1900, p. 150).
