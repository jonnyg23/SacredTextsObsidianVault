 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">In</span> the study of the native religions of North and South America, there is a special attraction bound up with the special perplexity of the subject. These religions, like the peoples which have held them, seem to stand historically apart from the rest of humanity, unrelated, underived, independent. The first question that occurs to the ethnologist when he looks at the native American races is, How and when did they get there? With which of the other human families are they most nearly connected? In the present state of knowledge, we still infer a "unity" in the human race, and decline to believe that different human species were independently evolved from lower forms in different continents, acquiring the same physical structure under widely varying conditions. <a name="fr_1747"></a><a href="#fn_1747"><font size="1">1</font></a> The suggestion to this effect by Waitz <a name="fr_1748"></a><a href="#fn_1748"><font size="1">2</font></a> represents the state of speculation before the bearings of the Darwinian theory had been realised. <a name="fr_1749"></a><a href="#fn_1749"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>  
 <p>It is therefore fitting that ethnologists should try to trace a connection between the native races of America and the races of Asia, which are the nearest to them in geographical position. Until that hypothesis is either established or overthrown, our anthropology and our moral science must remain in large part unsettled. It has been argued that "we may safely leave to ethnologists the task of deciding whether the whole human race descends from one original couple or from many; for, spiritually speaking, humanity in any case is one. It is one same spirit that animates it and is developed in it; and this, the incontestable unity of our race, is likewise the only unity we need care to insist on." <a name="fr_1750"></a><a href="#fn_1750"><font size="1">4</font></a> But this defines rather the theological than the scientific attitude: for the very question whether</p>

 <p>an alleged spiritual unity is independent of a biological or genealogical unity is one of the preliminary problems of true "spiritual" science.</p>  
 <p>As we go into detail, we shall see some remarkable coincidences between American and Asiatic and European and Polynesian religious systems; and our conception of human nature must alter a good deal according as we decide that certain peculiar superstitions and ritual practices were reached alike by various races who grew separately out of pre-human species, and these out of still lower species, in different parts of the world, without intermixture; or decide that the whole of the man-like family developed interconnectedly over one area, and that the different races now existing did not branch off from the central stem till they had already acquired what we call human characteristicsthat is, until they had reached the stage of speech, weapons, and fire, at which they probably had "religion."</p>  
 <p>Suppose, for instance, that the American races came many thousands of years ago from Asia, and that they are kindred to the earlier Asiatic races: they would already have the germs of myths and a certain religious bias in common with peoples whose descendants subsist in Asia; and the coincidences in their religion would have to be pronounced historical, that is, they would represent a sequence of phenomena substantially determined by one original set of conditions within a given area and territory. If, on the other hand, we suppose that evolution proceeded in different parts of the planet and in widely different environments on identical lines from the lowest forms of life through many others, up to the anthropoid and the human, our whole conception of evolutionary law is affected, and that in turn must affect our philosophy. Looking inductively for evidence, we find what appear to be clear traces of the existence of man in the Mississippi valley between fifty and sixty thousand years ago, or perhaps even in the "inter-glacial" period. Without deciding as to times, it would seem certain that palæolithic man, whether by way of Behring Strait or of Greenland and Labrador, peopled America from Asia or Western Europe; <a name="fr_1751"></a><a href="#fn_1751"><font size="1">1</font></a> and there are some grounds for inferring two distinct racial movements. <a name="fr_1752"></a><a href="#fn_1752"><font size="1">2</font></a> But to whatever conclusions the palæologist may come on that head, <a name="fr_1753"></a><a href="#fn_1753"><font size="1">3</font></a> the original scientific and logical veto on the hypothesis of</p>

 <p><a name="page_341"><font size="1" color="green">p. 341</font></a></p>  
 <p>two or more independent evolutions of the human species must for the present hold good.</p>  
 <p>However remote be the time of the first migration, then, we are shut up to the assumption that the American races derive from Asia, either directly or by way of Polynesia, <a name="fr_1754"></a><a href="#fn_1754"><font size="1">1</font></a> since the alternative is a hypothesis of a human evolution from pre-human forms in the New World, with the result of yielding an identical human species, while the fauna and flora in general are markedly different. As to the possibility of such an evolution in America, Haeckel gives an emphatic negative. Putting the two hypotheses of immigration from north-east Asia and from Polynesia, he adds: "In any case the original inhabitants of America came from the Old World, and are certainly not, as some suppose, evolved from American apes. Catarrhine or small-nosed apes have at no period existed in America." <a name="fr_1755"></a><a href="#fn_1755"><font size="1">2</font></a> The fact that men are so much alike in the two hemispheres, while the animals are so widely different, is a proof that the former are not autochthonous in America. <a name="fr_1756"></a><a href="#fn_1756"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>  
 <p>Nor is there any physical difficulty over the hypothesis that the American races proceeded, by successive waves of emigration, from Asia. <a name="fr_1757"></a><a href="#fn_1757"><font size="1">4</font></a> At Behring Strait Asia and America are almost within sight of each other; and at one time they were united. And if we suppose a migration of tribes like the Kamtskadals, who easily bear extreme cold, being but slightly civilised, we dispose of all such difficulties as the suggestion that pastoral Mongols would never have crossed without some of their animals. Prescott, however, remarks that "it would be easy for the inhabitant of Eastern Tartary or Japan to steer his course from islet to islet, quite across to the American shore, without being on the ocean more than two days at a time"; <a name="fr_1758"></a><a href="#fn_1758"><font size="1">5</font></a> and this hypothesis is open. <a name="fr_1759"></a><a href="#fn_1759"><font size="1">6</font></a> The question is one for the exact solution of which we have not sufficient materials; and it must be admitted that some ethnologists in the past came to their conclusions</p>

 <p>lightly. It has been said of Pickering, for instance, that he set up a connection between the Malay and the Californian because each had an open countenance, one wife, and no tomahawk. <a name="fr_1760"></a><a href="#fn_1760"><font size="1">1</font></a> Happily we need not resort to such inductions as these. Nor need we be deterred from the scientific search by the fact that some of the guesses made have been wildly absurd. There is said to be widely current in Peru a legend, fully believed by the natives, that the name of the first Inca, Manco Capac, arose in the actual advent of a shipwrecked Englishman, who got to be known as <i>Ingasman</i>, and who married the daughter of one <i>Cocapac</i>, his son being accordingly called <i>Ingasman Cocapac</i>, whence the name and title Inca <i>Manco Capac</i>. <a name="fr_1761"></a><a href="#fn_1761"><font size="1">2</font></a> That is droll enough; but we need not therefore proceed with Dr. Réville dogmatically to decide that "<i>everything shows</i> that the civilisations of Mexico and Peru are autochthonous, <i>springing from the soil itself</i>." <a name="fr_1762"></a><a href="#fn_1762"><font size="1">3</font></a> If it be meant merely that the higher forms of those civilisations (for there were many separate processes) may have subsisted for many centuries without foreign influence, there is no dispute; but the statement as it stands is an unwarranted assertion of a separate human evolution from pre-human forms.</p>  
 <p>In the nature of the case, the primary separation of the American from the Asiatic races being admittedly very remote, there are not many close parallels to be expected. A number of extraordinary correspondences, however, have been traced, which point to migrations posterior to the Stone Ages. Take that, for instance, between the Aztec calendar signs and the Mongolian zodiac. "The symbols in the Mongolian calendar are borrowed from animals. Four of the twelve are the same as the Aztec. Three others are as nearly the same as the different species of animals in the two hemispheres would allow. The remaining five refer to no creature then found in Anahuac. The resemblance went as far as it could." <a name="fr_1763"></a><a href="#fn_1763"><font size="1">4</font></a> And no less remarkable is the "analogy between the Mexican system of reckoning years by cycles and that still in use over a great part of Asia," seeing that "this complex arrangement answers no useful purpose, inasmuch</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>

 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_343"><font size="1" color="green">p. 343</font></a></p>  
 <p>as mere counting by numbers, or by signs numbered in regular succession, would have been a far better arrangement." <a name="fr_1764"></a><a href="#fn_1764"><font size="1">1</font></a> Such a correspondence must be allowed to count for much; and there is also a remarkable, though perhaps not a conclusive, resemblance between the Aztec, pre-Aztec, and Peruvian temple-pyramids and those of Mesopotamia, <a name="fr_1765"></a><a href="#fn_1765"><font size="1">2</font></a> which derived from the earlier Akkadians or Sumerians. Ruins of these still subsist in Central America and Peru which can be compared with the records of those of Babylonia and the one example at Saqqara in Egypt. <a name="fr_1766"></a><a href="#fn_1766"><font size="1">3</font></a> Those temples or "mountain houses" doubtless began as graves, and grew into great mounds of earth, like those found in the Mississippi valley; <a name="fr_1767"></a><a href="#fn_1767"><font size="1">4</font></a> and the Asiatic like the Mexican pyramid was latterly one of several stages or terraces. <a name="fr_1768"></a><a href="#fn_1768"><font size="1">5</font></a> Five seems to have been long a common number in Asia, the Babylonian number seven being reached only at a late period; <a name="fr_1769"></a><a href="#fn_1769"><font size="1">6</font></a> and five was the number of stages or stories in the great temple of Huitzilopochtli, the Mexican national God. <a name="fr_1770"></a><a href="#fn_1770"><font size="1">7</font></a> In the fact that such pyramid temples, or tombs of the same typethe former often carefully covered with masonry, and having likewise in some cases five stagesare found in many of the South Sea Islands, <a name="fr_1771"></a><a href="#fn_1771"><font size="1">8</font></a> we have a fresh reason for supposing an ancient distribution of races eastwards from Asia, in repeated waves of migration. <a name="fr_1772"></a><a href="#fn_1772"><font size="1">9</font></a> So, too, we are entitled to surmise kinship, when we find that the Mexicans and some Native American tribes <a name="fr_1773"></a><a href="#fn_1773"><font size="1">10</font></a> had a fixed usage of throwing the first morsels of their meals into the fire; <a name="fr_1774"></a><a href="#fn_1774"><font size="1">11</font></a> that something like this is the practice of the islanders of</p>

Even the practice of scalping seems to be peculiar to the Native Americans and the kindred Polynesians, and, in a modified form, <a name="fr_1779"></a><a href="#fn_1779"><font size="1">5</font></a> to the Mongols; <a name="fr_1780"></a><a href="#fn_1780"><font size="1">6</font></a> and, as we shall see, the Mexicans, like the ancient Semites and their Sumer-Akkadian teachers, passed their children "through the fire" to the Fire-God. What is more significant, they had the Semitic usage of making certain of their special sacrificial observances last for five days. <a name="fr_1781"></a><a href="#fn_1781"><font size="1">7</font></a></p>  
 <p>There are remarkable concrete parallels, also, in the religious practices and symbolisms of Asia and Mexico, apart from those which may be taken as universal. Thus a stone or metal mirror was the symbol, and the source of the name, of the Mexican God Tezcatlipoca; and it is also the outstanding symbol in Japanese Shintoism, <a name="fr_1782"></a><a href="#fn_1782"><font size="1">8</font></a> recognisably a very primitive Asiatic cult. It is told, again, of the national God and War-God Huitzilopochtli that, when the people came to Mexico from their home, his wooden image with certain war-emblems was carried by four priests in an ark or chest, called the Seat of God. Here we have a widespread usage; <a name="fr_1783"></a><a href="#fn_1783"><font size="1">9</font></a> but it is significant that it is found in some closely similar form among Mongols, Chinese, and Japanese. So with the casting of children's horoscopes. <a name="fr_1784"></a><a href="#fn_1784"><font size="1">10</font></a> More specific is the parallel between certain Mexican usages and those of the Buddhist priests of Thibet and Japansuch as red and yellow headdresses and black robes, <a name="fr_1785"></a><a href="#fn_1785"><font size="1">11</font></a> which were in all likelihood pre-Buddhistic. Singularly suggestive of Buddhist contacts, however, are a number of Mexican sculptures: many figures of Quetzalcoatl are practically identical with the established type of Buddha; and other carvings show hardly less close parallels. <a name="fr_1786"></a><a href="#fn_1786"><font size="1">12</font></a> But</p>

 <p>no less significant of a general Asiatic connection, perhaps, is a circumstance which has not been much considered by the ethnologists, though it has been noted by the anthropologiststhe fact, namely, that both in ancient Asia and in ancient America men kept records by means of knots in strings. <a name="fr_1787"></a><a href="#fn_1787"><font size="1">1</font></a> The Chinese in old times are known to have done so; <a name="fr_1788"></a><a href="#fn_1788"><font size="1">2</font></a> and it is told of he Dravidian Khonds of Orissa that when brought to European knowledge sixty years ago they "kept all accounts by knots on strings," and conceived of their Gods as recording men's faults in the same fashion. <a name="fr_1789"></a><a href="#fn_1789"><font size="1">3</font></a> This would seem to be exactly the method of mnemonics used by the Peruvians when they were discovered by the Spaniards, their <i>quipus</i> being described in the same terms; and there is evidence that the same device was used in Central America, and perhaps among the Tlascalans, though it had gone into disuse among the Mexicans, who had attained to the use of "hieroglyphics." <a name="fr_1790"></a><a href="#fn_1790"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>  
 <p>There remains the question of the source and nature of those hieroglyphics. To examine it in detail is beyond the scope of this survey; and it must suffice to say that as the Mexican hieroglyphic system proper represents an early stage in the evolution of writing from pictures to phonetic symbols, with a phonetic system developed alongside of it, <a name="fr_1791"></a><a href="#fn_1791"><font size="1">5</font></a> the phenomena are quite consistent with the hypothesis of culture influences from Asia at a remote period. It is not necessary to identify glyphs in order to infer that the Chinese, Egyptian, and Aztec systems are akin. The Egyptian symbols remained substantially undeveloped for at least two thousand years; <a name="fr_1792"></a><a href="#fn_1792"><font size="1">6</font></a> and recent specialists are satisfied that "many of the elements of hieroglyphic writing had been growing upon the banks of the Nile long before the time of the first historic dynasty." <a name="fr_1793"></a><a href="#fn_1793"><font size="1">7</font></a> Given such a slow rate of growth, and noting the fact that Mexican and Egyptian hieroglyphics, and Chinese script, are all written in columns, we are provisionally entitled to see in all three the stages of a continuous evolution. <a name="fr_1794"></a><a href="#fn_1794"><font size="1">8</font></a></p>

 <p>It is true that the American languages, while demonstrably akin to each other, like the Indo-European group, show little or no relation to any of the languages of Asia. But though the difficulty of fully proving affinities of language between American and Asiatic races is great, and we seem thus bound to suppose a very remote separation indeed; on the other hand the extraordinary difference between the tongues of American Indians of the same race <a name="fr_1795"></a><a href="#fn_1795"><font size="1">1</font></a> and the observed facts as to the rapid changes of language among South Sea islanders, when isolated from each other, go to suggest that very wide deviation may occur in a few thousands of years among people of one stock who have separated at a stage in which they have no literature, and only the material beginnings of a ritual. Beyond this we need not go. It suffices that there is no conceptual obstacle to the assumption that the civilisation of pre-Christian America grew from the central Asiatic roots which fed the beginnings of civilisation as we know it in Mediterranean Asia and Europe; and that from the practical certainty of an original migration of Asiatics to America there follows the probability that there occurred several, at different stages of Asiatic evolution. <a name="fr_1796"></a><a href="#fn_1796"><font size="1">2</font></a> The hypothesis which seems best to meet all the facts is that America was first peopled from Asia at an extremely remote period; that there slowly grew up American races with a certain definite type of language; and that later immigrants from Asia or Polynesia, perhaps coming as conquerors in virtue of importing a higher civilisation, were linguistically absorbed in the earlier mass, as conquering invaders have repeatedly been in the known history of Europe. <a name="fr_1797"></a><a href="#fn_1797"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>
