  <h3 align="center">Young's Literal Translation: Philemon</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timotheus the brother,  to Philemon our beloved and fellow-worker,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> and Apphia the beloved, and Archippus our fellow-soldier,  and the assembly in thy house:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord  Jesus Christ!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> I give thanks to my God, always making mention of thee in my  prayers,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> hearing of thy love and faith that thou hast unto the Lord  Jesus and toward all the saints,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> that the fellowship of thy faith may become working in the  full knowledge of every good thing that [is] in you toward  Christ Jesus;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> for we have much joy and comfort in thy love, because the  bowels of the saints have been refreshed through thee,  brother.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> Wherefore, having in Christ much boldness to command thee  that which is fit --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> because of the love I rather entreat, being such an one as  Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> I entreat thee concerning my child -- whom I did beget in  my bonds -- Onesimus,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> who once was to thee unprofitable, and now is profitable to  me and to thee,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> whom I did send again, and thou him (that is, my own  bowels) receive,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> whom I did wish to retain to myself, that in thy behalf he  might minister to me in the bonds of the good news,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> and apart from thy mind I willed to do nothing, that as of  necessity thy good deed may not be, but of willingness,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> for perhaps because of this he did depart for an hour, that  age-duringly thou mayest have him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> no more as a servant, but above a servant -- a brother  beloved, especially to me, and how much more to thee, both in  the flesh and in the Lord!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> If, then, with me thou hast fellowship, receive him as me,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> and if he did hurt to thee, or doth owe anything, this to  me be reckoning;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:19">1:19</a> I, Paul did write with my hand, I -- I will repay; that I  may not say that also thyself, besides, to me thou dost owe.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:20">1:20</a> Yes, brother, may I have profit of thee in the Lord;  refresh my bowels in the Lord;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:21">1:21</a> having been confident in thy obedience I did write to thee,  having known that also above what I may say thou wilt do;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:22">1:22</a> and at the same time also prepare for me a lodging, for I  hope that through your prayers I shall be granted to you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:23">1:23</a> Salute thee doth Epaphras, (my fellow-captive in Christ  Jesus,)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:24">1:24</a> Markus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lukas, my fellow-workmen!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:25">1:25</a> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [is] with your spirit!  Amen.</p>
