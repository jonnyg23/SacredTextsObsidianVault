  <h3 align="center">Young's Literal Translation: Acts</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> The former account, indeed, I made concerning all things, O  Theophilus, that Jesus began both to do and to teach,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> till the day in which, having given command, through the  Holy Spirit, to the apostles whom he did choose out, he was  taken up,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> to whom also he did present himself alive after his  suffering, in many certain proofs, through forty days being  seen by them, and speaking the things concerning the reign of  God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> And being assembled together with them, he commanded them  not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of  the Father, which, [saith he,] `Ye did hear of me;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> because John, indeed, baptized with water, and ye shall be  baptized with the Holy Spirit -- after not many days.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> They, therefore, indeed, having come together, were  questioning him, saying, `Lord, dost thou at this time restore  the reign to Israel?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> and he said unto them, `It is not yours to know times or  seasons that the Father did appoint in His own authority;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> but ye shall receive power at the coming of the Holy Spirit  upon you, and ye shall be witnesses to me both in Jerusalem,  and in all Judea, and Samaria, and unto the end of the earth.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> And these things having said -- they beholding -- he was  taken up, and a cloud did receive him up from their sight;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> and as they were looking stedfastly to the heaven in his  going on, then, lo, two men stood by them in white apparel,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> who also said, `Men, Galileans, why do ye stand gazing into  the heaven? this Jesus who was received up from you into the  heaven, shall so come in what manner ye saw him going on to  the heaven.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> Then did they return to Jerusalem from the mount that is  called of Olives, that is near Jerusalem, a sabbath's journey;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> and when they came in, they went up to the upper room,  where were abiding both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew,  Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James, of  Alphaeus, and Simon the Zelotes, and Judas, of James;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> these all were continuing with one accord in prayer and  supplication, with women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and  with his brethren.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> And in these days, Peter having risen up in the midst of  the disciples, said, (the multitude also of the names at the  same place was, as it were, an hundred and twenty,)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> `Men, brethren, it behoved this Writing that it be  fulfilled that beforehand the Holy Spirit spake through the  mouth of David, concerning Judas, who became guide to those who  took Jesus,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> because he was numbered among us, and did receive the share  in this ministration,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> this one, indeed, then, purchased a field out of the reward  of unrighteousness, and falling headlong, burst asunder in the  midst, and all his bowels gushed forth,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:19">1:19</a> and it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem,  insomuch that that place is called, in their proper dialect,  Aceldama, that is, field of blood,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:20">1:20</a> for it hath been written in the book of Psalms: Let his  lodging-place become desolate, and let no one be dwelling in  it, and his oversight let another take.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:21">1:21</a> `It behoveth, therefore, of the men who did go with us  during all the time in which the Lord Jesus went in and went  out among us,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:22">1:22</a> beginning from the baptism of John, unto the day in which  he was received up from us, one of these to become with us a  witness of his rising again.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:23">1:23</a> And they set two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed  Justus, and Matthias,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:24">1:24</a> and having prayed, they said, `Thou, Lord, who art knowing  the heart of all, shew which one thou didst choose of these two</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:25">1:25</a> to receive the share of this ministration and apostleship,  from which Judas, by transgression, did fall, to go on to his  proper place;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:26">1:26</a> and they gave their lots, and the lot fell upon Matthias,  and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> And in the day of the Pentecost being fulfilled, they were  all with one accord at the same place,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> and there came suddenly out of the heaven a sound as of a  bearing violent breath, and it filled all the house where they  were sitting,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> and there appeared to them divided tongues, as it were of  fire; it sat also upon each one of them,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to  speak with other tongues, according as the Spirit was giving  them to declare.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> And there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men from  every nation of those under the heaven,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> and the rumour of this having come, the multitude came  together, and was confounded, because they were each one  hearing them speaking in his proper dialect,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> and they were all amazed, and did wonder, saying one unto  another, `Lo, are not all these who are speaking Galileans?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> and how do we hear, each in our proper dialect, in which we  were born?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and those dwelling in  Mesopotamia, in Judea also, and Cappadocia, Pontus, and Asia,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> Phrygia also, and Pamphylia, Egypt, and the parts of Libya,  that [are] along Cyrene, and the strangers of Rome, both Jews  and proselytes,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> Cretes and Arabians, we did hear them speaking in our  tongues the great things of God.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one  unto another, `What would this wish to be?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> and others mocking said, -- `They are full of sweet wine;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> and Peter having stood up with the eleven, lifted up his  voice and declared to them, `Men, Jews! and all those dwelling  in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and harken to my  sayings,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> for these are not drunken, as ye take it up, for it is the  third hour of the day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> `But this is that which hath been spoken through the  prophet Joel:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> And it shall be in the last days, saith God, I will pour  out of My Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your  daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see  visions, and your old men shall dream dreams;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:18">2:18</a> and also upon My men-servants, and upon My maid-servants,  in those days, I will pour out of My Spirit, and they shall  prophesy;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:19">2:19</a> and I will give wonders in the heaven above, and signs upon  the earth beneath -- blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:20">2:20</a> the sun shall be turned to darkness, and the moon to blood,  before the coming of the day of the Lord -- the great and  illustrious;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:21">2:21</a> and it shall be, every one -- whoever shall call upon the  name of the Lord, he shall be saved.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:22">2:22</a> `Men, Israelites! hear these words, Jesus the Nazarene, a  man approved of God among you by mighty works, and wonders, and  signs, that God did through him in the midst of you, according  as also ye yourselves have known;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:23">2:23</a> this one, by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of  God, being given out, having taken by lawless hands, having  crucified -- ye did slay;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:24">2:24</a> whom God did raise up, having loosed the pains of the  death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:25">2:25</a> for David saith in regard to him: I foresaw the Lord always  before me -- because He is on my right hand -- that I may not  be moved;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:26">2:26</a> because of this was my heart cheered, and my tongue was  glad, and yet -- my flesh also shall rest on hope,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:27">2:27</a> because Thou wilt not leave my soul to hades, nor wilt Thou  give Thy Kind One to see corruption;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:28">2:28</a> Thou didst make known to me ways of life, Thou shalt fill  me with joy with Thy countenance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:29">2:29</a> `Men, brethren! it is permitted to speak with freedom unto  you concerning the patriarch David, that he both died and was  buried, and his tomb is among us unto this day;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:30">2:30</a> a prophet, therefore, being, and knowing that with an oath  God did swear to him, out of the fruit of his loins, according  to the flesh, to raise up the Christ, to sit upon his throne,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:31">2:31</a> having foreseen, he did speak concerning the rising again  of the Christ, that his soul was not left to hades, nor did  his flesh see corruption.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:32">2:32</a> `This Jesus did God raise up, of which we are all  witnesses;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:33">2:33</a> at the right hand then of God having been exalted -- also  the promise of the Holy Spirit having received from the Father  -- he was shedding forth this, which now ye see and hear;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:34">2:34</a> for David did not go up to the heavens, and he saith  himself: The Lord saith to my lord, Sit thou at my right hand,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:35">2:35</a> till I make thy foes thy footstool;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:36">2:36</a> assuredly, therefore, let all the house of Israel know,  that both Lord and Christ did God make him -- this Jesus whom  ye did crucify.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:37">2:37</a> And having heard, they were pricked to the heart; they say  also to Peter, and to the rest of the apostles, `What shall we  do, men, brethren?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:38">2:38</a> and Peter said unto them, `Reform, and be baptized each of  you on the name of Jesus Christ, to remission of sins, and ye  shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:39">2:39</a> for to you is the promise, and to your children, and to all  those afar off, as many as the Lord our God shall call.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:40">2:40</a> Also with many more other words he was testifying and  exhorting, saying, `Be saved from this perverse generation;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:41">2:41</a> then those, indeed, who did gladly receive his word were  baptized, and there were added on that day, as it were, three  thousand souls,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:42">2:42</a> and they were continuing stedfastly in the teaching of the  apostles, and the fellowship, and the breaking of the bread,  and the prayers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:43">2:43</a> And fear came on every soul, many wonders also and signs  were being done through the apostles,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:44">2:44</a> and all those believing were at the same place, and had all  things common,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:45">2:45</a> and the possessions and the goods they were selling, and  were parting them to all, according as any one had need.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:46">2:46</a> Daily also continuing with one accord in the temple,  breaking also at every house bread, they were partaking of food  in gladness and simplicity of heart,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:47">2:47</a> praising God, and having favour with all the people, and  the Lord was adding those being saved every day to the  assembly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> And Peter and John were going up at the same time to the  temple, at the hour of the prayer, the ninth [hour],</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> and a certain man, being lame from the womb of his mother,  was being carried, whom they were laying every day at the gate  of the temple, called Beautiful, to ask a kindness from those  entering into the temple,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> who, having seen Peter and John about to go into the temple,  was begging to receive a kindness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> And Peter, having looked stedfastly toward him with John,  said, `Look toward us;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> and he was giving heed to them, looking to receive something  from them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> and Peter said, `Silver and gold I have none, but what I  have, that I give to thee; in the name of Jesus Christ of  Nazareth, rise up and be walking.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> And having seized him by the right hand, he raised [him] up,  and presently his feet and ankles were strengthened,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> and springing up, he stood, and was walking, and did enter  with them into the temple, walking and springing, and praising  God;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> and all the people saw him walking and praising God,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> they were knowing him also that this it was who for a  kindness was sitting at the Beautiful gate of the temple, and  they were filled with wonder and amazement at what hath  happened to him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> And at the lame man who was healed holding Peter and John,  all the people ran together unto them in the porch called  Solomon's -- greatly amazed,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> and Peter having seen, answered unto the people, `Men,  Israelites! why wonder ye at this? or on us why look ye so  earnestly, as if by our own power or piety we have made him to  walk?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> `The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of  our fathers, did glorify His child Jesus, whom ye delivered up,  and denied him in the presence of Pilate, he having given  judgment to release [him],</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> and ye the Holy and Righteous One did deny, and desired a  man -- a murderer -- to be granted to you,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> and the Prince of the life ye did kill, whom God did raise  out of the dead, of which we are witnesses;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> and on the faith of his name, this one whom ye see and have  known, his name made strong, even the faith that [is] through  him did give to him this perfect soundness before you all.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> `And now, brethren, I have known that through ignorance ye  did [it], as also your rulers;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:18">3:18</a> and God, what things before He had declared through the  mouth of all His prophets, that the Christ should suffer, He  did thus fulfil;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:19">3:19</a> reform ye, therefore, and turn back, for your sins being  blotted out, that times of refreshing may come from the  presence of the Lord,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:20">3:20</a> and He may send Jesus Christ who before hath been preached  to you,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:21">3:21</a> whom it behoveth heaven, indeed, to receive till times of a  restitution of all things, of which God spake through the mouth  of all His holy prophets from the age.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:22">3:22</a> `For Moses, indeed, unto the fathers said -- A prophet to  you shall the Lord your God raise up out of your brethren, like  to me; him shall ye hear in all things, as many as he may speak  unto you;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:23">3:23</a> and it shall be, every soul that may not hear that prophet  shall be utterly destroyed out of the people;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:24">3:24</a> and also all the prophets from Samuel and those following  in order, as many as spake, did also foretell of these days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:25">3:25</a> `Ye are sons of the prophets, and of the covenant that God  made unto our fathers, saying unto Abraham: And in thy seed  shall be blessed all the families of the earth;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:26">3:26</a> to you first, God, having raised up His child Jesus, did  send him, blessing you, in the turning away of each one from  your evil ways.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> And as they are speaking unto the people, there came to them  the priests, and the magistrate of the temple, and the  Sadducees --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> being grieved because of their teaching the people, and  preaching in Jesus the rising again out of the dead --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> and they laid hands upon them, and did put them in custody  unto the morrow, for it was evening already;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> and many of those hearing the word did believe, and the  number of the men became, as it were, five thousand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> And it came to pass upon the morrow, there were gathered  together of them the rulers, and elders, and scribes, to  Jerusalem,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> and Annas the chief priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and  Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the chief  priest,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> and having set them in the midst, they were inquiring, `In  what power, or in what name did ye do this?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> Then Peter, having been filled with the Holy Spirit, said  unto them: `Rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:9">4:9</a> if we to-day are examined concerning the good deed to the  ailing man, by whom he hath been saved,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:10">4:10</a> be it known to all of you, and to all the people of Israel,  that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye did  crucify, whom God did raise out of the dead, in him hath this  one stood by before you whole.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:11">4:11</a> `This is the stone that was set at nought by you -- the  builders, that became head of a corner;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:12">4:12</a> and there is not salvation in any other, for there is no  other name under the heaven that hath been given among men, in  which it behoveth us to be saved.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:13">4:13</a> And beholding the openness of Peter and John, and having  perceived that they are men unlettered and plebeian, they were  wondering -- they were taking knowledge also of them that with  Jesus they had been --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:14">4:14</a> and seeing the man standing with them who hath been healed,  they had nothing to say against [it],</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:15">4:15</a> and having commanded them to go away out of the sanhedrim,  they took counsel with one another,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:16">4:16</a> saying, `What shall we do to these men? because that,  indeed, a notable sign hath been done through them, to all  those dwelling in Jerusalem [is] manifest, and we are not able  to deny [it];</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:17">4:17</a> but that it may spread no further toward the people, let us  strictly threaten them no more to speak in this name to any  man.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:18">4:18</a> And having called them, they charged them not to speak at  all, nor to teach, in the name of Jesus,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:19">4:19</a> and Peter and John answering unto them said, `Whether it is  righteous before God to hearken to you rather than to God,  judge ye;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:20">4:20</a> for we cannot but speak what we did see and hear.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:21">4:21</a> And they having further threatened [them], let them go,  finding nothing how they may punish them, because of the  people, because all were glorifying God for that which hath  been done,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:22">4:22</a> for above forty years of age was the man upon whom had been  done this sign of the healing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:23">4:23</a> And being let go, they went unto their own friends, and  declared whatever the chief priests and the elders said unto  them,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:24">4:24</a> and they having heard, with one accord did lift up the  voice unto God, and said, `Lord, thou [art] God, who didst  make the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all that  [are] in them,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:25">4:25</a> who, through the mouth of David thy servant, did say, Why  did nations rage, and peoples meditate vain things?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:26">4:26</a> the kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were  gathered together against the Lord and against His Christ;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:27">4:27</a> for gathered together of a truth against Thy holy child  Jesus, whom Thou didst anoint, were both Herod and Pontius  Pilate, with nations and peoples of Israel,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:28">4:28</a> to do whatever Thy hand and Thy counsel did determine  before to come to pass.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:29">4:29</a> `And now, Lord, look upon their threatenings, and grant to  Thy servants with all freedom to speak Thy word,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:30">4:30</a> in the stretching forth of Thy hand, for healing, and  signs, and wonders, to come to pass through the name of Thy  holy child Jesus.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:31">4:31</a> And they having prayed, the place was shaken in which they  were gathered together, and they were all filled with the Holy  Spirit, and were speaking the word of God with freedom,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:32">4:32</a> and of the multitude of those who did believe the heart and  the soul was one, and not one was saying that anything of the  things he had was his own, but all things were to them in  common.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:33">4:33</a> And with great power were the apostles giving the testimony  to the rising again of the Lord Jesus, great grace also was on  them all,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:34">4:34</a> for there was not any one among them who did lack, for as  many as were possessors of fields, or houses, selling [them],  were bringing the prices of the thing sold,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:35">4:35</a> and were laying them at the feet of the apostles, and  distribution was being made to each according as any one had  need.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:36">4:36</a> And Joses, who was surnamed by the apostles Barnabas --  which is, having been interpreted, Son of Comfort -- a Levite,  of Cyprus by birth,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:37">4:37</a> a field being his, having sold [it], brought the money and  laid [it] at the feet of the apostles.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:1">5:1</a> And a certain man, Ananias by name, with Sapphira his wife,  sold a possession,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:2">5:2</a> and did keep back of the price -- his wife also knowing --  and having brought a certain part, at the feet of the apostles  he laid [it].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:3">5:3</a> And Peter said, `Ananias, wherefore did the Adversary fill  thy heart, for thee to lie to the Holy Spirit, and to keep  back of the price of the place?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:4">5:4</a> while it remained, did it not remain thine? and having been  sold, in thy authority was it not? why [is] it that thou didst  put in thy heart this thing? thou didst not lie to men, but to  God;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:5">5:5</a> and Ananias hearing these words, having fallen down, did  expire, and great fear came upon all who heard these things,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:6">5:6</a> and having risen, the younger men wound him up, and having  carried forth, they buried [him].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:7">5:7</a> And it came to pass, about three hours after, that his wife,  not knowing what hath happened, came in,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:8">5:8</a> and Peter answered her, `Tell me if for so much ye sold the  place;' and she said, `Yes, for so much.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:9">5:9</a> And Peter said unto her, `How was it agreed by you, to tempt  the Spirit of the Lord? lo, the feet of those who did bury thy  husband [are] at the door, and they shall carry thee forth;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:10">5:10</a> and she fell down presently at his feet, and expired, and  the young men having come in, found her dead, and having  carried forth, they buried [her] by her husband;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:11">5:11</a> and great fear came upon all the assembly, and upon all who  heard these things.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:12">5:12</a> And through the hands of the apostles came many signs and  wonders among the people, and they were with one accord all in  the porch of Solomon;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:13">5:13</a> and of the rest no one was daring to join himself to them,  but the people were magnifying them,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:14">5:14</a> (and the more were believers added to the Lord, multitudes  both of men and women,)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:15">5:15</a> so as into the broad places to bring forth the ailing, and  to lay [them] upon couches and mats, that at the coming of  Peter, even [his] shadow might overshadow some one of them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:16">5:16</a> and there were coming together also the people of the  cities round about to Jerusalem, bearing ailing persons, and  those harassed by unclean spirits -- who were all healed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:17">5:17</a> And having risen, the chief priest, and all those with him  -- being the sect of the Sadducees -- were filled with zeal,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:18">5:18</a> and laid their hands upon the apostles, and did put them in  a public prison;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:19">5:19</a> and a messenger of the Lord through the night opened the  doors of the prison, having also brought them forth, he said,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:20">5:20</a> `Go on, and standing, speak in the temple to the people all  the sayings of this life;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:21">5:21</a> and having heard, they did enter at the dawn into the  temple, and were teaching. And the chief priest having come,  and those with him, they called together the sanhedrim and all  the senate of the sons of Israel, and they sent to the prison  to have them brought,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:22">5:22</a> and the officers having come, did not find them in the  prison, and having turned back, they told,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:23">5:23</a> saying -- `The prison indeed we found shut in all safety,  and the keepers standing without before the doors, and having  opened -- within we found no one.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:24">5:24</a> And as the priest, and the magistrate of the temple, and  the chief priests, heard these words, they were doubting  concerning them to what this would come;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:25">5:25</a> and coming near, a certain one told them, saying -- `Lo,  the men whom ye did put in the prison are in the temple  standing and teaching the people;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:26">5:26</a> then the magistrate having gone away with officers, brought  them without violence, for they were fearing the people, lest  they should be stoned;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:27">5:27</a> and having brought them, they set [them] in the sanhedrim,  and the chief priest questioned them,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:28">5:28</a> saying, `Did not we strictly command you not to teach in  this name? and lo, ye have filled Jerusalem with your teaching,  and ye intend to bring upon us the blood of this man.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:29">5:29</a> And Peter and the apostles answering, said, `To obey God it  behoveth, rather than men;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:30">5:30</a> and the God of our fathers did raise up Jesus, whom ye  slew, having hanged upon a tree;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:31">5:31</a> this one God, a Prince and a Saviour, hath exalted with His  right hand, to give reformation to Israel, and forgiveness of  sins;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:32">5:32</a> and we are His witnesses of these sayings, and the Holy  Spirit also, whom God gave to those obeying him.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:33">5:33</a> And they having heard, were cut [to the heart], and were  taking counsel to slay them,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:34">5:34</a> but a certain one, having risen up in the sanhedrim -- a  Pharisee, by name Gamaliel, a teacher of law honoured by all  the people -- commanded to put the apostles forth a little,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:35">5:35</a> and said unto them, `Men, Israelites, take heed to  yourselves about these men, what ye are about to do,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:36">5:36</a> for before these days rose up Theudas, saying, that himself  was some one, to whom a number of men did join themselves, as  it were four hundred, who was slain, and all, as many as were  obeying him, were scattered, and came to nought.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:37">5:37</a> `After this one rose up, Judas the Galilean, in the days of  the enrollment, and drew away much people after him, and that  one perished, and all, as many as were obeying him, were  scattered;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:38">5:38</a> and now I say to you, Refrain from these men, and let them  alone, because if this counsel or this work may be of men, it  will be overthrown,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:39">5:39</a> and if it be of God, ye are not able to overthrow it, lest  perhaps also ye be found fighting against God.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:40">5:40</a> And to him they agreed, and having called near the  apostles, having beaten [them], they commanded [them] not to  speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:41">5:41</a> they, indeed, then, departed from the presence of the  sanhedrim, rejoicing that for his name they were counted worthy  to suffer dishonour,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:42">5:42</a> every day also in the temple, and in every house, they were  not ceasing teaching and proclaiming good news -- Jesus the  Christ.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:1">6:1</a> And in these days, the disciples multiplying, there came a  murmuring of the Hellenists at the Hebrews, because their  widows were being overlooked in the daily ministration,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:2">6:2</a> and the twelve, having called near the multitude of the  disciples, said, `It is not pleasing that we, having left the  word of God, do minister at tables;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:3">6:3</a> look out, therefore, brethren, seven men of you who are well  testified of, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we may  set over this necessity,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:4">6:4</a> and we to prayer, and to the ministration of the word, will  give ourselves continually.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:5">6:5</a> And the thing was pleasing before all the multitude, and  they did choose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy  Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and  Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:6">6:6</a> whom they did set before the apostles, and they, having  prayed, laid on them [their] hands.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:7">6:7</a> And the word of God did increase, and the number of the  disciples did multiply in Jerusalem exceedingly; a great  multitude also of the priests were obedient to the faith.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:8">6:8</a> And Stephen, full of faith and power, was doing great  wonders and signs among the people,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:9">6:9</a> and there arose certain of those of the synagogue, called of  the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of those  from Cilicia, and Asia, disputing with Stephen,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:10">6:10</a> and they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit  with which he was speaking;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:11">6:11</a> then they suborned men, saying -- `We have heard him  speaking evil sayings in regard to Moses and God.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:12">6:12</a> They did stir up also the people, and the elders, and the  scribes, and having come upon [him], they caught him, and  brought [him] to the sanhedrim;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:13">6:13</a> they set up also false witnesses, saying, `This one doth  not cease to speak evil sayings against this holy place and the  law,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:14">6:14</a> for we have heard him saying, That this Jesus the Nazarean  shall overthrow this place, and shall change the customs that  Moses delivered to us;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:15">6:15</a> and gazing at him, all those sitting in the sanhedrim saw  his face as it were the face of a messenger.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:1">7:1</a> And the chief priest said, `Are then these things so?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:2">7:2</a> and he said, `Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken: The God  of the glory did appear to our father Abraham, being in  Mesopotamia, before his dwelling in Haran,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:3">7:3</a> and He said to him, Go forth out of thy land, and out of thy  kindred, and come to a land that I shall shew thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:4">7:4</a> `Then having come forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, he  dwelt in Haran, and from thence, after the death of his  father, He did remove him to this land wherein ye now dwell,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:5">7:5</a> and He gave him no inheritance in it, not even a footstep,  and did promise to give it to him for a possession, and to his  seed after him -- he having no child.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:6">7:6</a> `And God spake thus, That his seed shall be sojourning in a  strange land, and they shall cause it to serve, and shall do  it evil four hundred years,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:7">7:7</a> and the nation whom they shall serve I will judge, said God;  and after these things they shall come forth and shall do Me  service in this place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:8">7:8</a> `And He gave to him a covenant of circumcision, and so he  begat Isaac, and did circumcise him on the eighth day, and  Isaac [begat] Jacob, and Jacob -- the twelve patriarchs;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:9">7:9</a> and the patriarchs, having been moved with jealousy, sold  Joseph to Egypt, and God was with him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:10">7:10</a> and did deliver him out of all his tribulations, and gave  him favour and wisdom before Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he did  set him -- governor over Egypt and all his house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:11">7:11</a> `And there came a dearth upon all the land of Egypt and  Canaan, and great tribulation, and our fathers were not  finding sustenance,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:12">7:12</a> and Jacob having heard that there was corn in Egypt, sent  forth our fathers a first time;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:13">7:13</a> and at the second time was Joseph made known to his  brethren, and Joseph's kindred became manifest to Pharaoh,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:14">7:14</a> and Joseph having sent, did call for his father Jacob, and  all his kindred -- with seventy and five souls --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:15">7:15</a> and Jacob went down to Egypt, and died, himself and our  fathers,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:16">7:16</a> and they were carried over into Sychem, and were laid in  the tomb that Abraham bought for a price in money from the sons  of Emmor, of Sychem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:17">7:17</a> `And according as the time of the promise was drawing nigh,  which God did swear to Abraham, the people increased and  multiplied in Egypt,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:18">7:18</a> till another king rose, who had not known Joseph;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:19">7:19</a> this one, having dealt subtilely with our kindred, did evil  to our fathers, causing to expose their babes, that they might  not live;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:20">7:20</a> in which time Moses was born, and he was fair to God, and  he was brought up three months in the house of his father;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:21">7:21</a> and he having been exposed, the daughter of Pharaoh took  him up, and did rear him to herself for a son;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:22">7:22</a> and Moses was taught in all wisdom of the Egyptians, and he  was powerful in words and in works.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:23">7:23</a> `And when forty years were fulfilled to him, it came upon  his heart to look after his brethren, the sons of Israel;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:24">7:24</a> and having seen a certain one suffering injustice, he did  defend, and did justice to the oppressed, having smitten the  Egyptian;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:25">7:25</a> and he was supposing his brethren to understand that God  through his hand doth give salvation; and they did not  understand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:26">7:26</a> `On the succeeding day, also, he shewed himself to them as  they are striving, and urged them to peace, saying, Men,  brethren are ye, wherefore do ye injustice to one another?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:27">7:27</a> and he who is doing injustice to the neighbour, did thrust  him away, saying, Who set thee a ruler and a judge over us?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:28">7:28</a> to kill me dost thou wish, as thou didst kill yesterday the  Egyptian?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:29">7:29</a> `And Moses fled at this word, and became a sojourner in the  land of Midian, where he begat two sons,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:30">7:30</a> and forty years having been fulfilled, there appeared to  him in the wilderness of mount Sinai a messenger of the Lord,  in a flame of fire of a bush,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:31">7:31</a> and Moses having seen did wonder at the sight; and he  drawing near to behold, there came a voice of the Lord unto  him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:32">7:32</a> I [am] the God of thy fathers; the God of Abraham, and the  God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. `And Moses having become  terrified, durst not behold,</p>

 <p><a name="an_7:34">7:34</a> seeing I have seen the affliction of My people that [is] in  Egypt, and their groaning I did hear, and came down to deliver  them; and now come, I will send thee to Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:35">7:35</a> `This Moses, whom they did refuse, saying, Who did set thee  a ruler and a judge? this one God a ruler and a redeemer did  send, in the hand of a messenger who appeared to him in the  bush;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:36">7:36</a> this one did bring them forth, having done wonders and  signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red Sea, and in the  wilderness forty years;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:37">7:37</a> this is the Moses who did say to the sons of Israel: A  prophet to you shall the Lord your God raise up out of your  brethren, like to me, him shall ye hear.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:38">7:38</a> `This is he who was in the assembly in the wilderness, with  the messenger who is speaking to him in the mount Sinai, and  with our fathers who did receive the living oracles to give to  us;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:39">7:39</a> to whom our fathers did not wish to become obedient, but  did thrust away, and turned back in their hearts to Egypt,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:40">7:40</a> saying to Aaron, Make to us gods who shall go on before us,  for this Moses, who brought us forth out of the land of Egypt,  we have not known what hath happened to him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:41">7:41</a> `And they made a calf in those days, and brought a  sacrifice to the idol, and were rejoicing in the works of  their hands,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:42">7:42</a> and God did turn, and did give them up to do service to the  host of the heaven, according as it hath been written in the  scroll of the prophets: Slain beasts and sacrifices did ye  offer to Me forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:43">7:43</a> and ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of  your god Remphan -- the figures that ye made to bow before  them, and I will remove your dwelling beyond Babylon.</p>

 <p><a name="an_7:46">7:46</a> who found favour before God, and requested to find a  tabernacle for the God of Jacob;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:47">7:47</a> and Solomon built Him an house.</p>

 <p><a name="an_7:54">7:54</a> And hearing these things, they were cut to the hearts, and  did gnash the teeth at him;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:55">7:55</a> and being full of the Holy Spirit, having looked stedfastly  to the heaven, he saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on  the right hand of God,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:56">7:56</a> and he said, `Lo, I see the heavens having been opened, and  the Son of Man standing on the right hand of God.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:57">7:57</a> And they, having cried out with a loud voice, stopped their  ears, and did rush with one accord upon him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:58">7:58</a> and having cast him forth outside of the city, they were  stoning [him] -- and the witnesses did put down their garments  at the feet of a young man called Saul --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:59">7:59</a> and they were stoning Stephen, calling and saying, `Lord  Jesus, receive my spirit;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:60">7:60</a> and having bowed the knees, he cried with a loud voice,  `Lord, mayest thou not lay to them this sin;' and this having  said, he fell asleep.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:1">8:1</a> And Saul was assenting to his death, and there came in that  day a great persecution upon the assembly in Jerusalem, all  also were scattered abroad in the regions of Judea and Samaria,  except the apostles;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:2">8:2</a> and devout men carried away Stephen, and made great  lamentation over him;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:3">8:3</a> and Saul was making havoc of the assembly, into every house  entering, and haling men and women, was giving them up to  prison;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:4">8:4</a> they then indeed, having been scattered, went abroad  proclaiming good news -- the word.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:5">8:5</a> And Philip having gone down to a city of Samaria, was  preaching to them the Christ,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:6">8:6</a> the multitudes also were giving heed to the things spoken by  Philip, with one accord, in their hearing and seeing the signs  that he was doing,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:7">8:7</a> for unclean spirits came forth from many who were possessed,  crying with a loud voice, and many who have been paralytic and  lame were healed,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:8">8:8</a> and there was great joy in that city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:9">8:9</a> And a certain man, by name Simon, was before in the city  using magic, and amazing the nation of Samaria, saying himself  to be a certain great one,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:10">8:10</a> to whom they were all giving heed, from small unto great,  saying, `This one is the great power of God;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:11">8:11</a> and they were giving heed to him, because of his having for  a long time amazed them with deeds of magic.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:12">8:12</a> And when they believed Philip, proclaiming good news, the  things concerning the reign of God and the name of Jesus  Christ, they were baptized both men and women;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:13">8:13</a> and Simon also himself did believe, and, having been  baptized, he was continuing with Philip, beholding also signs  and mighty acts being done, he was amazed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:14">8:14</a> And the apostles in Jerusalem having heard that Samaria  hath received the word of God, did send unto them Peter and  John,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:15">8:15</a> who having come down did pray concerning them, that they  may receive the Holy Spirit, --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:16">8:16</a> for as yet he was fallen upon none of them, and only they  have been baptized -- to the name of the Lord Jesus;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:17">8:17</a> then were they laying hands on them, and they received the  Holy Spirit.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:18">8:18</a> And Simon, having beheld that through the laying on of the  hands of the apostles, the Holy Spirit is given, brought before  them money,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:19">8:19</a> saying, `Give also to me this authority, that on whomsoever  I may lay the hands, he may receive the Holy Spirit.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:20">8:20</a> And Peter said unto him, `Thy silver with thee -- may it be  to destruction! because the gift of God thou didst think to  possess through money;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:21">8:21</a> thou hast neither part nor lot in this thing, for thy heart  is not right before God;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:22">8:22</a> reform, therefore, from this thy wickedness, and beseech  God, if then the purpose of thy heart may be forgiven thee,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:23">8:23</a> for in the gall of bitterness, and bond of unrighteousness,  I perceive thee being.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:24">8:24</a> And Simon answering, said, `Beseech ye for me unto the  Lord, that nothing may come upon me of the things ye have  spoken.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:25">8:25</a> They indeed, therefore, having testified fully, and spoken  the word of the Lord, did turn back to Jerusalem; in many  villages also of the Samaritans they did proclaim good news.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:26">8:26</a> And a messenger of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying,  `Arise, and go on toward the south, on the way that is going  down from Jerusalem to Gaza,' -- this is desert.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:27">8:27</a> And having arisen, he went on, and lo, a man of Ethiopia, a  eunuch, a man of rank, of Candace the queen of the Ethiopians,  who was over all her treasure, who had come to worship to  Jerusalem;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:28">8:28</a> he was also returning, and is sitting on his chariot, and  he was reading the prophet Isaiah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:29">8:29</a> And the Spirit said to Philip, `Go near, and be joined to  this chariot;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:30">8:30</a> and Philip having run near, heard him reading the prophet  Isaiah, and said, `Dost thou then know what thou dost read?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:31">8:31</a> and he said, `Why, how am I able, if some one may not guide  me?' he called Philip also, having come up, to sit with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:32">8:32</a> And the contents of the Writing that he was reading was  this: `As a sheep unto slaughter he was led, and as a lamb  before his shearer dumb, so he doth not open his mouth;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:33">8:33</a> in his humiliation his judgment was taken away, and his  generation -- who shall declare? because taken from the earth  is his life.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:34">8:34</a> And the eunuch answering Philip said, `I pray thee, about  whom doth the prophet say this? about himself, or about some  other one?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:35">8:35</a> and Philip having opened his mouth, and having begun from  this Writing, proclaimed good news to him -- Jesus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:36">8:36</a> And as they were going on the way, they came upon a certain  water, and the eunuch said, `Lo, water; what doth hinder me to  be baptized?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:37">8:37</a> [And Philip said, `If thou dost believe out of all the  heart, it is lawful;' and he answering said, `I believe Jesus  Christ to be the Son of God;']</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:38">8:38</a> and he commanded the chariot to stand still, and they both  went down to the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and he  baptized him;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:39">8:39</a> and when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the  Lord caught away Philip, and the eunuch saw him no more, for  he was going on his way rejoicing;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:40">8:40</a> and Philip was found at Azotus, and passing through, he was  proclaiming good news to all the cities, till his coming to  Cesarea.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:1">9:1</a> And Saul, yet breathing of threatening and slaughter to the  disciples of the Lord, having gone to the chief priest,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:2">9:2</a> did ask from him letters to Damascus, unto the synagogues,  that if he may find any being of the way, both men and women,  he may bring them bound to Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:3">9:3</a> And in the going, he came nigh to Damascus, and suddenly  there shone round about him a light from the heaven,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:4">9:4</a> and having fallen upon the earth, he heard a voice saying to  him, `Saul, Saul, why me dost thou persecute?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:5">9:5</a> And he said, `Who art thou, Lord?' and the Lord said, `I am  Jesus whom thou dost persecute; hard for thee at the pricks to  kick;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:6">9:6</a> trembling also, and astonished, he said, `Lord, what dost  thou wish me to do?' and the Lord [said] unto him, `Arise, and  enter into the city, and it shall be told thee what it  behoveth thee to do.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:7">9:7</a> And the men who are journeying with him stood speechless,  hearing indeed the voice but seeing no one,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:8">9:8</a> and Saul arose from the earth, and his eyes having been  opened, he beheld no one, and leading him by the hand they  brought him to Damascus,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:9">9:9</a> and he was three days without seeing, and he did neither eat  nor drink.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:10">9:10</a> And there was a certain disciple in Damascus, by name  Ananias, and the Lord said unto him in a vision, `Ananias;' and  he said, `Behold me, Lord;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:11">9:11</a> and the Lord [saith] unto him, `Having risen, go on unto  the street that is called Straight, and seek in the house of  Judas, [one] by name Saul of Tarsus, for, lo, he doth pray,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:12">9:12</a> and he saw in a vision a man, by name Ananias, coming in,  and putting a hand on him, that he may see again.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:13">9:13</a> And Ananias answered, `Lord, I have heard from many about  this man, how many evils he did to Thy saints in Jerusalem,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:14">9:14</a> and here he hath authority from the chief priests, to bind  all those calling on Thy name.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:15">9:15</a> And the Lord said unto him, `Be going on, because a choice  vessel to Me is this one, to bear My name before nations and  kings -- the sons also of Israel;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:16">9:16</a> for I will shew him how many things it behoveth him for My  name to suffer.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:17">9:17</a> And Ananias went away, and did enter into the house, and  having put upon him [his] hands, said, `Saul, brother, the Lord  hath sent me -- Jesus who did appear to thee in the way in  which thou wast coming -- that thou mayest see again, and  mayest be filled with the Holy Spirit.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:18">9:18</a> And immediately there fell from his eyes as it were scales,  he saw again also presently, and having risen, was baptized,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:19">9:19</a> and having received nourishment, was strengthened, and Saul  was with the disciples in Damascus certain days,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:20">9:20</a> and immediately in the synagogues he was preaching the  Christ, that he is the Son of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:21">9:21</a> And all those hearing were amazed, and said, `Is not this  he who laid waist in Jerusalem those calling on this name, and  hither to this intent had come, that he might bring them bound  to the chief priests?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:22">9:22</a> And Saul was still more strengthened, and he was  confounding the Jews dwelling in Damascus, proving that this is  the Christ.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:23">9:23</a> And when many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel  together to kill him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:24">9:24</a> and their counsel against [him] was known to Saul; they  were also watching the gates both day and night, that they may  kill him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:25">9:25</a> and the disciples having taken him, by night did let him  down by the wall, letting down in a basket.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:26">9:26</a> And Saul, having come to Jerusalem, did try to join himself  to the disciples, and they were all afraid of him, not  believing that he is a disciple,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:27">9:27</a> and Barnabas having taken him, brought [him] unto the  apostles, and did declare to them how in the way he saw the  Lord, and that he spake to him, and how in Damascus he was  speaking boldly in the name of Jesus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:28">9:28</a> And he was with them, coming in and going out in Jerusalem,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:29">9:29</a> and speaking boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, he was  both speaking and disputing with the Hellenists, and they were  taking in hand to kill him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:30">9:30</a> and the brethren having known, brought him down to Cesarea,  and sent him forth to Tarsus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:31">9:31</a> Then, indeed, the assemblies throughout all Judea, and  Galilee, and Samaria, had peace, being built up, and, going on  in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy  Spirit, they were multiplied.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:32">9:32</a> And it came to pass that Peter passing throughout all  [quarters], came down also unto the saints who were dwelling at  Lydda,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:33">9:33</a> and he found there a certain man, Aeneas by name -- for  eight years laid upon a couch -- who was paralytic,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:34">9:34</a> and Peter said to him, `Aeneas, heal thee doth Jesus the  Christ; arise and spread for thyself;' and immediately he rose,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:35">9:35</a> and all those dwelling at Lydda, and Saron saw him, and did  turn to the Lord.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:36">9:36</a> And in Joppa there was a certain female disciple, by name  Tabitha, (which interpreted, is called Dorcas,) this woman was  full of good works and kind acts that she was doing;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:37">9:37</a> and it came to pass in those days she, having ailed, died,  and having bathed her, they laid her in an upper chamber,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:38">9:38</a> and Lydda being nigh to Joppa, the disciples having heard  that Peter is in that [place], sent two men unto him, calling  on him not to delay to come through unto them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:39">9:39</a> And Peter having risen, went with them, whom having come,  they brought into the upper chamber, and all the widows stood  by him weeping, and shewing coats and garments, as many as  Dorcas was making while she was with them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:40">9:40</a> And Peter having put them all forth without, having bowed  the knees, did pray, and having turned unto the body said,  `Tabitha, arise;' and she opened her eyes, and having seen  Peter, she sat up,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:41">9:41</a> and having given her [his] hand, he lifted her up, and  having called the saints and the widows, he presented her  alive,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:42">9:42</a> and it became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed  on the Lord;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:43">9:43</a> and it came to pass, that he remained many days in Joppa,  with a certain one, Simon a tanner.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:1">10:1</a> And there was a certain man in Cesarea, by name Cornelius,  a centurion from a band called Italian,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:2">10:2</a> pious, and fearing God with all his house, doing also many  kind acts to the people, and beseeching God always,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:3">10:3</a> he saw in a vision manifestly, as it were the ninth hour of  the day, a messenger of God coming in unto him, and saying to  him, `Cornelius;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:4">10:4</a> and he having looked earnestly on him, and becoming afraid,  said, `What is it, Lord?' And he said to him, `Thy prayers and  thy kind acts came up for a memorial before God,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:5">10:5</a> and now send men to Joppa, and send for a certain one  Simon, who is surnamed Peter,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:6">10:6</a> this one doth lodge with a certain Simon a tanner, whose  house is by the sea; this one shall speak to thee what it  behoveth thee to do.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:7">10:7</a> And when the messenger who is speaking to Cornelius went  away, having called two of his domestics, and a pious soldier  of those waiting on him continually,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:8">10:8</a> and having declared to them all things, he sent them to  Joppa.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:9">10:9</a> And on the morrow, as these are proceeding on the way, and  are drawing nigh to the city, Peter went up upon the house-top  to pray, about the sixth hour,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:10">10:10</a> and he became very hungry, and wished to eat; and they  making ready, there fell upon him a trance,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:11">10:11</a> and he doth behold the heaven opened, and descending unto  him a certain vessel, as a great sheet, bound at the four  corners, and let down upon the earth,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:12">10:12</a> in which were all the four-footed beasts of the earth, and  the wild beasts, and the creeping things, and the fowls of the  heaven,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:13">10:13</a> and there came a voice unto him: `Having risen, Peter,  slay and eat.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:14">10:14</a> And Peter said, `Not so, Lord; because at no time did I  eat anything common or unclean;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:15">10:15</a> and [there is] a voice again a second time unto him: `What  God did cleanse, thou, declare not thou common;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:16">10:16</a> and this was done thrice, and again was the vessel  received up to the heaven.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:17">10:17</a> And as Peter was perplexed in himself what the vision that  he saw might be, then, lo, the men who have been sent from  Cornelius, having made inquiry for the house of Simon, stood  at the gate,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:18">10:18</a> and having called, they were asking if Simon, who is  surnamed Peter, doth lodge here?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:19">10:19</a> And Peter thinking about the vision, the Spirit said to  him, `Lo, three men do seek thee;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:20">10:20</a> but having risen, go down and go on with them, nothing  doubting, because I have sent them;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:21">10:21</a> and Peter having come down unto the men who have been sent  from Cornelius unto him, said, `Lo, I am he whom ye seek, what  [is] the cause for which ye are present?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:22">10:22</a> And they said, `Cornelius, a centurion, a man righteous  and fearing God, well testified to, also, by all the nation of  the Jews, was divinely warned by a holy messenger to send for  thee, to his house, and to hear sayings from thee.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:23">10:23</a> Having called them in, therefore, he lodged them, and on  the morrow Peter went forth with them, and certain of the  brethren from Joppa went with him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:24">10:24</a> and on the morrow they did enter into Cesarea; and  Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his  kindred and near friends,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:25">10:25</a> and as it came that Peter entered in, Cornelius having met  him, having fallen at [his] feet, did bow before [him];</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:26">10:26</a> and Peter raised him, saying, `Stand up; I also myself am  a man;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:27">10:27</a> and talking with him he went in, and doth find many having  come together.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:28">10:28</a> And he said unto them, `Ye know how it is unlawful for a  man, a Jew, to keep company with, or to come unto, one of  another race, but to me God did shew to call no man common or  unclean;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:29">10:29</a> therefore also without gainsaying I came, having been sent  for; I ask, therefore, for what matter ye did send for me?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:30">10:30</a> And Cornelius said, `Four days ago till this hour, I was  fasting, and [at] the ninth hour praying in my house, and, lo,  a man stood before me in bright clothing,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:31">10:31</a> and he said, Cornelius, thy prayer was heard, and thy kind  acts were remembered before God;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:32">10:32</a> send, therefore, to Joppa, and call for Simon, who is  surnamed Peter; this one doth lodge in the house of Simon a  tanner, by the sea, who having come, shall speak to thee;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:33">10:33</a> at once, therefore, I sent to thee; thou also didst do  well, having come; now, therefore, are we all before God  present to hear all things that have been commanded thee by  God.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:34">10:34</a> And Peter having opened his mouth, said, `Of a truth, I  perceive that God is no respecter of persons,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:35">10:35</a> but in every nation he who is fearing Him, and is working  righteousness, is acceptable to Him;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:36">10:36</a> the word that he sent to the sons of Israel, proclaiming  good news -- peace through Jesus Christ (this one is Lord of  all,)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:37">10:37</a> ye -- ye have known; -- the word that came throughout all  Judea, having begun from Galilee, after the baptism that John  preached;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:38">10:38</a> Jesus who [is] from Nazareth -- how God did anoint him  with the Holy Spirit and power; who went through, doing good,  and healing all those oppressed by the devil, because God was  with him;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:39">10:39</a> and we -- we are witnesses of all things that he did, both  in the country of the Jews, and in Jerusalem, -- whom they did  slay, having hanged upon a tree.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:40">10:40</a> `This one God did raise up the third day, and gave him to  become manifest,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:41">10:41</a> not to all the people, but to witnesses, to those having  been chosen before by God -- to us who did eat with [him], and  did drink with him, after his rising out of the dead;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:42">10:42</a> and he commanded us to preach to the people, and to  testify fully that it is he who hath been ordained by God judge  of living and dead --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:43">10:43</a> to this one do all the prophets testify, that through his  name every one that is believing in him doth receive remission  of sins.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:44">10:44</a> While Peter is yet speaking these sayings, the Holy spirit  fell upon all those hearing the word,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:45">10:45</a> and those of the circumcision believing were astonished --  as many as came with Peter -- because also upon the nations the  gift of the Holy Spirit hath been poured out,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:46">10:46</a> for they were hearing them speaking with tongues and  magnifying God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:47">10:47</a> Then answered Peter, `The water is any one able to forbid,  that these may not be baptized, who the Holy Spirit did  receive -- even as also we?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:48">10:48</a> he commanded them also to be baptized in the name of the  Lord; then they besought him to remain certain days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:1">11:1</a> And the apostles and the brethren who are in Judea heard  that also the nations did receive the word of God,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:2">11:2</a> and when Peter came up to Jerusalem, those of the  circumcision were contending with him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:3">11:3</a> saying -- `Unto men uncircumcised thou didst go in, and  didst eat with them!'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:4">11:4</a> And Peter having begun, did expound to them in order  saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:5">11:5</a> `I was in the city of Joppa praying, and I saw in a trance  a vision, a certain vessel coming down, as a great sheet by  four corners being let down out of the heaven, and it came unto  me;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:6">11:6</a> at which having looked stedfastly, I was considering, and I  saw the four-footed beasts of the earth, and the wild beasts,  and the creeping things, and the fowls of heaven;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:7">11:7</a> and I heard a voice saying to me, Having risen, Peter, slay  and eat;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:8">11:8</a> and I said, Not so, Lord; because anything common or  unclean hath at no time entered into my mouth;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:9">11:9</a> and a voice did answer me a second time out of the heaven,  What God did cleanse, thou -- declare not thou common.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:10">11:10</a> `And this happened thrice, and again was all drawn up to  the heaven,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:11">11:11</a> and, lo, immediately, three men stood at the house in  which I was, having been sent from Cesarea unto me,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:12">11:12</a> and the Spirit said to me to go with them, nothing  doubting, and these six brethren also went with me, and we did  enter into the house of the man,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:13">11:13</a> he declared also to us how he saw the messenger in his  house standing, and saying to him, Send men to Joppa, and call  for Simon, who is surnamed Peter,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:14">11:14</a> who shall speak sayings by which thou shalt be saved, thou  and all thy house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:15">11:15</a> `And in my beginning to speak, the Holy Spirit did fall  upon them, even as also upon us in the beginning,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:16">11:16</a> and I remembered the saying of the Lord, how he said, John  indeed did baptize with water, and ye shall be baptized with  the Holy Spirit;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:17">11:17</a> if then the equal gift God did give to them as also to us,  having believed upon the Lord Jesus Christ, I -- how was I able  to withstand God?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:18">11:18</a> And they, having heard these things, were silent, and were  glorifying God, saying, `Then, indeed, also to the nations did  God give the reformation to life.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:19">11:19</a> Those, indeed, therefore, having been scattered abroad,  from the tribulation that came after Stephen, went through unto  Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to none  except to Jews only;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:20">11:20</a> and there were certain of them men of Cyprus and Cyrene,  who having entered into Antioch, were speaking unto the  Hellenists, proclaiming good news -- the Lord Jesus,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:21">11:21</a> and the hand of the Lord was with them, a great number  also, having believed, did turn unto the Lord.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:22">11:22</a> And the account was heard in the ears of the assembly that  [is] in Jerusalem concerning them, and they sent forth Barnabas  to go through unto Antioch,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:23">11:23</a> who, having come, and having seen the grace of God, was  glad, and was exhorting all with purpose of heart to cleave to  the Lord,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:24">11:24</a> because he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit,  and of faith, and a great multitude was added to the Lord.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:25">11:25</a> And Barnabas went forth to Tarsus, to seek for Saul,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:26">11:26</a> and having found him, he brought him to Antioch, and it  came to pass that they a whole year did assemble together in  the assembly, and taught a great multitude, the disciples also  were divinely called first in Antioch Christians.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:27">11:27</a> And in those days there came from Jerusalem prophets to  Antioch,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:28">11:28</a> and one of them, by name Agabus, having stood up, did  signify through the Spirit a great dearth is about to be  throughout all the world -- which also came to pass in the time  of Claudius Caesar --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:29">11:29</a> and the disciples, according as any one was prospering,  determined each of them to send for ministration to the  brethren dwelling in Judea,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:30">11:30</a> which also they did, having sent unto the elders by the  hand of Barnabas and Saul.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:1">12:1</a> And about that time, Herod the king put forth his hands, to  do evil to certain of those of the assembly,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:2">12:2</a> and he killed James, the brother of John, with the sword,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:3">12:3</a> and having seen that it is pleasing to the Jews, he added  to lay hold of Peter also -- and they were the days of the  unleavened food --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:4">12:4</a> whom also having seized, he did put in prison, having  delivered [him] to four quaternions of soldiers to guard him,  intending after the passover to bring him forth to the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:5">12:5</a> Peter, therefore, indeed, was kept in the prison, and  fervent prayer was being made by the assembly unto God for  him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:6">12:6</a> and when Herod was about to bring him forth, the same night  was Peter sleeping between two soldiers, having been bound with  two chains, guards also before the door were keeping the  prison,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:7">12:7</a> and lo, a messenger of the Lord stood by, and a light shone  in the buildings, and having smitten Peter on the side, he  raised him up, saying, `Rise in haste,' and his chains fell  from off [his] hands.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:8">12:8</a> The messenger also said to him, `Gird thyself, and bind on  thy sandals;' and he did so; and he saith to him, `Put thy  garment round and be following me;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:9">12:9</a> and having gone forth, he was following him, and he knew  not that it is true that which is done through the messenger,  and was thinking he saw a vision,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:10">12:10</a> and having passed through a first ward, and a second, they  came unto the iron gate that is leading to the city, which of  its own accord did open to them, and having gone forth, they  went on through one street, and immediately the messenger  departed from him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:11">12:11</a> And Peter having come to himself, said, `Now I have known  of a truth that the Lord did sent forth His messenger, and did  deliver me out of the hand of Herod, and all the expectation of  the people of the Jews;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:12">12:12</a> also, having considered, he came unto the house of Mary,  the mother of John, who is surnamed Mark, where there were many  thronged together and praying.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:13">12:13</a> And Peter having knocked at the door of the porch, there  came a damsel to hearken, by name Rhoda,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:14">12:14</a> and having known the voice of Peter, from the joy she did  not open the porch, but having run in, told of the standing of  Peter before the porch,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:15">12:15</a> and they said unto her, `Thou art mad;' and she was  confidently affirming [it] to be so, and they said, `It is his  messenger;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:16">12:16</a> and Peter was continuing knocking, and having opened, they  saw him, and were astonished,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:17">12:17</a> and having beckoned to them with the hand to be silent, he  declared to them how the Lord brought him out of the prison,  and he said, `Declare to James and to the brethren these  things;' and having gone forth, he went on to another place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:18">12:18</a> And day having come, there was not a little stir among the  soldiers what then was become of Peter,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:19">12:19</a> and Herod having sought for him, and not having found,  having examined the guards, did command [them] to be led away  to punishment, and having gone down from Judea to Cesarea, he  was abiding [there].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:20">12:20</a> And Herod was highly displeased with the Tyrians and  Sidonians, and with one accord they came unto him, and having  made a friend of Blastus, who [is] over the bed-chambers of the  king, they were asking peace, because of their country being  nourished from the king's;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:21">12:21</a> and on a set day, Herod having arrayed himself in kingly  apparel, and having sat down upon the tribunal, was making an  oration unto them,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:22">12:22</a> and the populace were shouting, `The voice of a god, and  not of a man;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:23">12:23</a> and presently there smote him a messenger of the Lord,  because he did not give the glory to God, and having been eaten  of worms, he expired.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:24">12:24</a> And the word of God did grow and did multiply,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:25">12:25</a> and Barnabas and Saul did turn back out of Jerusalem,  having fulfilled the ministration, having taken also with  [them] John, who was surnamed Mark.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:1">13:1</a> And there were certain in Antioch, in the assembly there,  prophets and teachers; both Barnabas, and Simeon who is called  Niger, and Lucius the Cyrenian, Manaen also -- Herod the  tetrarch's foster-brother -- and Saul;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:2">13:2</a> and in their ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy  Spirit said, `Separate ye to me both Barnabas and Saul to the  work to which I have called them,'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:3">13:3</a> then having fasted, and having prayed, and having laid the  hands on them, they sent [them] away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:4">13:4</a> These, indeed, then, having been sent forth by the Holy  Spirit, went down to Seleucia, thence also they sailed to  Cyprus,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:5">13:5</a> and having come unto Salamis, they declared the word of God  in the synagogues of the Jews, and they had also John [as] a  ministrant;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:6">13:6</a> and having gone through the island unto Paphos, they found  a certain magian, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name [is]  Bar-Jesus;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:7">13:7</a> who was with the proconsul Sergius Paulus, an intelligent  man; this one having called for Barnabas and Saul, did desire  to hear the word of God,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:8">13:8</a> and there withstood them Elymas the magian -- for so is his  name interpreted -- seeking to pervert the proconsul from the  faith.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:9">13:9</a> And Saul -- who also [is] Paul -- having been filled with  the Holy Spirit, and having looked stedfastly on him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:10">13:10</a> said, `O full of all guile, and all profligacy, son of a  devil, enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease  perverting the right ways of the Lord?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:11">13:11</a> and now, lo, a hand of the Lord [is] upon thee, and thou  shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season;' and  presently there fell upon him a mist and darkness, and he,  going about, was seeking some to lead [him] by the hand;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:12">13:12</a> then the proconsul having seen what hath come to pass, did  believe, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:13">13:13</a> And those about Paul having set sail from Paphos, came to  Perga of Pamphylia, and John having departed from them, did  turn back to Jerusalem,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:14">13:14</a> and they having gone through from Perga, came to Antioch  of Pisidia, and having gone into the synagogue on the  sabbath-day, they sat down,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:15">13:15</a> and after the reading of the law and of the prophets, the  chief men of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, `Men,  brethren, if there be a word in you of exhortation unto the  people -- say on.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:16">13:16</a> And Paul having risen, and having beckoned with the hand,  said, `Men, Israelites, and those fearing God, hearken:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:17">13:17</a> the God of this people Israel did choose our fathers, and  the people He did exalt in their sojourning in the land of  Egypt, and with an high arm did He bring them out of it;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:18">13:18</a> and about a period of forty years He did suffer their  manners in the wilderness,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:19">13:19</a> and having destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan,  He did divide by lot to them their land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:20">13:20</a> `And after these things, about four hundred and fifty  years, He gave judges -- till Samuel the prophet;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:21">13:21</a> and thereafter they asked for a king, and God did give to  them Saul, son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for  forty years;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:22">13:22</a> and having removed him, He did raise up to them David for  king, to whom also having testified, he said, I found David,  the [son] of Jesse, a man according to My heart, who shall do  all My will.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:23">13:23</a> `Of this one's seed God, according to promise, did raise  to Israel a Saviour -- Jesus,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:24">13:24</a> John having first preached, before his coming, a baptism  of reformation to all the people of Israel;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:25">13:25</a> and as John was fulfilling the course, he said, Whom me do  ye suppose to be? I am not [he], but, lo, he doth come after  me, of whom I am not worthy to loose the sandal of [his] feet.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:26">13:26</a> `Men, brethren, sons of the race of Abraham, and those  among you fearing God, to you was the word of this salvation  sent,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:27">13:27</a> for those dwelling in Jerusalem, and their chiefs, this  one not having known, also the voices of the prophets, which  every sabbath are being read -- having judged [him] -- did  fulfill,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:28">13:28</a> and no cause of death having found, they did ask of Pilate  that he should be slain,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:29">13:29</a> and when they did complete all the things written about  him, having taken [him] down from the tree, they laid him in a  tomb;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:30">13:30</a> and God did raise him out of the dead,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:31">13:31</a> and he was seen for many days of those who did come up  with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto  the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:32">13:32</a> `And we to you do proclaim good news -- that the promise  made unto the fathers,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:33">13:33</a> God hath in full completed this to us their children,  having raised up Jesus, as also in the second Psalm it hath  been written, My Son thou art -- I to-day have begotten thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:34">13:34</a> `And that He did raise him up out of the dead, no more to  return to corruption, he hath said thus -- I will give to you  the faithful kindnesses of David;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:35">13:35</a> wherefore also in another [place] he saith, Thou shalt not  give Thy kind One to see corruption,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:36">13:36</a> for David, indeed, his own generation having served by the  will of God, did fall asleep, and was added unto his fathers,  and saw corruption,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:37">13:37</a> but he whom God did raise up, did not see corruption.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:38">13:38</a> `Let it therefore be known to you, men, brethren, that  through this one to you is the forgiveness of sins declared,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:39">13:39</a> and from all things from which ye were not able in the law  of Moses to be declared righteous, in this one every one who  is believing is declared righteous;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:40">13:40</a> see, therefore, it may not come upon you that hath been  spoken in the prophets:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:41">13:41</a> See, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish, because a work  I -- I do work in your days, a work in which ye may not  believe, though any one may declare [it] to you.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:42">13:42</a> And having gone forth out of the synagogue of the Jews,  the nations were calling upon [them] that on the next sabbath  these sayings may be spoken to them,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:43">13:43</a> and the synagogue having been dismissed, many of the Jews  and of the devout proselytes did follow Paul and Barnabas, who,  speaking to them, were persuading them to remain in the grace  of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:44">13:44</a> And on the coming sabbath, almost all the city was  gathered together to hear the word of God,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:45">13:45</a> and the Jews having seen the multitudes, were filled with  zeal, and did contradict the things spoken by Paul --  contradicting and speaking evil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:46">13:46</a> And speaking boldly, Paul and Barnabas said, `To you it  was necessary that first the word of God be spoken, and seeing  ye do thrust it away, and do not judge yourselves worthy of the  life age-during, lo, we do turn to the nations;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:47">13:47</a> for so hath the Lord commanded us: I have set thee for a  light of nations -- for thy being for salvation unto the end of  the earth.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:48">13:48</a> And the nations hearing were glad, and were glorifying the  word of the Lord, and did believe -- as many as were appointed  to life age-during;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:49">13:49</a> and the word of the Lord was spread abroad through all the  region.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:50">13:50</a> And the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women,  and the first men of the city, and did raise persecution  against Paul and Barnabas, and did put them out from their  borders;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:51">13:51</a> and they having shaken off the dust of their feet against  them, came to Iconium,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:52">13:52</a> and the disciples were filled with joy and the Holy  Spirit.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:1">14:1</a> And it came to pass in Iconium, that they did enter  together into the synagogue of the Jews, and spake, so that  there believed both of Jews and Greeks a great multitude;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:2">14:2</a> and the unbelieving Jews did stir up and made evil the  souls of the nations against the brethren;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:3">14:3</a> long time, indeed, therefore, did they abide speaking  boldly in the Lord, who is testifying to the word of His grace,  and granting signs and wonders to come to pass through their  hands.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:4">14:4</a> And the multitude of the city was divided, and some were  with the Jews, and some with the apostles,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:5">14:5</a> and when there was a purpose both of the nations and of the  Jews with their rulers to use [them] despitefully, and to stone  them,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:6">14:6</a> they having become aware, did flee to the cities of  Lycaonia, Lystra, and Derbe, and to the region round about,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:7">14:7</a> and there they were proclaiming good news.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:8">14:8</a> And a certain man in Lystra, impotent in the feet, was  sitting, being lame from the womb of his mother -- who never  had walked,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:9">14:9</a> this one was hearing Paul speaking, who, having stedfastly  beheld him, and having seen that he hath faith to be saved,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:10">14:10</a> said with a loud voice, `Stand up on thy feet upright;'  and he was springing and walking,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:11">14:11</a> and the multitudes having seen what Paul did, did lift up  their voice, in the speech of Lycaonia, saying, `The gods,  having become like men, did come down unto us;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:12">14:12</a> they were calling also Barnabas Zeus, and Paul Hermes,  since he was the leader in speaking.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:13">14:13</a> And the priest of the Zeus that is before their city, oxen  and garlands unto the porches having brought, with the  multitudes did wish to sacrifice,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:14">14:14</a> and having heard, the apostles Barnabas and Paul, having  rent their garments, did spring into the multitude, crying</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:15">14:15</a> and saying, `Men, why these things do ye? and we are men  like-affected with you, proclaiming good news to you, from  these vanities to turn unto the living God, who made the  heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all the things in  them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:16">14:16</a> who in the past generations did suffer all the nations to  go on in their ways,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:17">14:17</a> though, indeed, without witness He did not leave himself,  doing good -- from heaven giving rains to us, and fruitful  seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:18">14:18</a> and these things saying, scarcely did they restrain the  multitudes from sacrificing to them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:19">14:19</a> And there came thither, from Antioch and Iconium, Jews,  and they having persuaded the multitudes, and having stoned  Paul, drew him outside of the city, having supposed him to be  dead;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:20">14:20</a> and the disciples having surrounded him, having risen he  entered into the city, and on the morrow he went forth with  Barnabas to Derbe.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:21">14:21</a> Having proclaimed good news also to that city, and having  discipled many, they turned back to Lystra, and Iconium, and  Antioch,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:22">14:22</a> confirming the souls of the disciples, exhorting to remain  in the faith, and that through many tribulations it behoveth  us to enter into the reign of God,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:23">14:23</a> and having appointed to them by vote elders in every  assembly, having prayed with fastings, they commended them to  the Lord in whom they had believed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:24">14:24</a> And having passed through Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:25">14:25</a> and having spoken in Perga the word, they went down to  Attalia,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:26">14:26</a> and thence did sail to Antioch, whence they had been given  by the grace of God for the work that they fulfilled;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:27">14:27</a> and having come and gathered together the assembly, they  declared as many things as God did with them, and that He did  open to the nations a door of faith;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:28">14:28</a> and they abode there not a little time with the disciples.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:1">15:1</a> And certain having come down from Judea, were teaching the  brethren -- `If ye be not circumcised after the custom of  Moses, ye are not able to be saved;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:2">15:2</a> there having been, therefore, not a little dissension and  disputation to Paul and Barnabas with them, they arranged for  Paul and Barnabas, and certain others of them, to go up unto  the apostles and elders to Jerusalem about this question,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:3">15:3</a> they indeed, then, having been sent forward by the  assembly, were passing through Phenice and Samaria, declaring  the conversion of the nations, and they were causing great joy  to all the brethren.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:4">15:4</a> And having come to Jerusalem, they were received by the  assembly, and the apostles, and the elders, they declared also  as many things as God did with them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:5">15:5</a> and there rose up certain of those of the sect of the  Pharisees who believed, saying -- `It behoveth to circumcise  them, to command them also to keep the law of Moses.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:6">15:6</a> And there were gathered together the apostles and the  elders, to see about this matter,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:7">15:7</a> and there having been much disputing, Peter having risen up  said unto them, `Men, brethren, ye know that from former days,  God among us did make choice, through my mouth, for the nations  to hear the word of the good news, and to believe;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:8">15:8</a> and the heart-knowing God did bare them testimony, having  given to them the Holy Spirit, even as also to us,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:9">15:9</a> and did put no difference also between us and them, by the  faith having purified their hearts;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:10">15:10</a> now, therefore, why do ye tempt God, to put a yoke upon  the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we  were able to bear?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:11">15:11</a> but, through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, we  believe to be saved, even as also they.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:12">15:12</a> And all the multitude did keep silence, and were  hearkening to Barnabas and Paul, declaring as many signs and  wonders as God did among the nations through them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:13">15:13</a> and after they are silent, James answered, saying, `Men,  brethren, hearken to me;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:14">15:14</a> Simeon did declare how at first God did look after to take  out of the nations a people for His name,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:15">15:15</a> and to this agree the words of the prophets, as it hath  been written:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:16">15:16</a> After these things I will turn back, and I will build  again the tabernacle of David, that is fallen down, and its  ruins I will build again, and will set it upright --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:17">15:17</a> that the residue of men may seek after the Lord, and all  the nations, upon whom My name hath been called, saith the  Lord, who is doing all these things.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:18">15:18</a> `Known from the ages to God are all His works;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:19">15:19</a> wherefore I judge: not to trouble those who from the  nations do turn back to God,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:20">15:20</a> but to write to them to abstain from the pollutions of the  idols, and the whoredom, and the strangled thing; and the  blood;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:21">15:21</a> for Moses from former generations in every city hath those  preaching him -- in the synagogues every sabbath being read.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:22">15:22</a> Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with  the whole assembly, chosen men out of themselves to send to  Antioch with Paul and Barnabas -- Judas surnamed Barsabas, and  Silas, leading men among the brethren --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:23">15:23</a> having written through their hand thus: `The apostles, and  the elders, and the brethren, to those in Antioch, and Syria,  and Cilicia, brethren, who [are] of the nations, greeting;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:24">15:24</a> seeing we have heard that certain having gone forth from  us did trouble you with words, subverting your souls, saying  to be circumcised and to keep the law, to whom we did give no  charge,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:25">15:25</a> it seemed good to us, having come together with one  accord, chosen men to send unto you, with our beloved Barnabas  and Paul --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:26">15:26</a> men who have given up their lives for the name of our Lord  Jesus Christ --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:27">15:27</a> we have sent, therefore, Judas and Silas, and they by word  are telling the same things.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:28">15:28</a> `For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, no more  burden to lay upon you, except these necessary things:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:29">15:29</a> to abstain from things offered to idols, and blood, and a  strangled thing, and whoredom; from which keeping yourselves,  ye shall do well; be strong!'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:30">15:30</a> They then, indeed, having been let go, went to Antioch,  and having brought the multitude together, did deliver the  epistle,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:31">15:31</a> and they having read, did rejoice for the consolation;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:32">15:32</a> Judas also and Silas, being themselves also prophets,  through much discourse did exhort the brethren, and confirm,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:33">15:33</a> and having passed some time, they were let go with peace  from the brethren unto the apostles;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:34">15:34</a> and it seemed good to Silas to remain there still.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:35">15:35</a> And Paul and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and  proclaiming good news -- with many others also -- the word of  the Lord;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:36">15:36</a> and after certain days, Paul said unto Barnabas, `Having  turned back again, we may look after our brethren, in every  city in which we have preached the word of the Lord -- how  they are.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:37">15:37</a> And Barnabas counseled to take with [them] John called  Mark,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:38">15:38</a> and Paul was not thinking it good to take him with them  who withdrew from them from Pamphylia, and did not go with  them to the work;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:39">15:39</a> there came, therefore, a sharp contention, so that they  were parted from one another, and Barnabas having taken Mark,  did sail to Cyprus,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:40">15:40</a> and Paul having chosen Silas, went forth, having been  given up to the grace of God by the brethren;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:41">15:41</a> and he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the  assemblies.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:1">16:1</a> And he came to Derbe and Lystra, and lo, a certain disciple  was there, by name Timotheus son of a certain woman, a  believing Jewess, but of a father, a Greek,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:2">16:2</a> who was well testified to by the brethren in Lystra and  Iconium;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:3">16:3</a> this one did Paul wish to go forth with him, and having  taken [him], he circumcised him, because of the Jews who are in  those places, for they all knew his father -- that he was a  Greek.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:4">16:4</a> And as they were going on through the cities, they were  delivering to them the decrees to keep, that have been judged  by the apostles and the elders who [are] in Jerusalem,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:5">16:5</a> then, indeed, were the assemblies established in the faith,  and were abounding in number every day;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:6">16:6</a> and having gone through Phrygia and the region of Galatia,  having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in  Asia,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:7">16:7</a> having gone toward Mysia, they were trying to go on toward  Bithynia, and the Spirit did not suffer them,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:8">16:8</a> and having passed by Mysia, they came down to Troas.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:9">16:9</a> And a vision through the night appeared to Paul -- a  certain man of Macedonia was standing, calling upon him, and  saying, `Having passed through to Macedonia, help us;' --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:10">16:10</a> and when he saw the vision, immediately we endeavoured to  go forth to Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord hath  called us to preach good news to them,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:11">16:11</a> having set sail, therefore, from Troas, we came with a  straight course to Samothracia, on the morrow also to  Neapolis,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:12">16:12</a> thence also to Philippi, which is a principal city of the  part of Macedonia -- a colony. And we were in this city  abiding certain days,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:13">16:13</a> on the sabbath-day also we went forth outside of the city,  by a river, where there used to be prayer, and having sat  down, we were speaking to the women who came together,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:14">16:14</a> and a certain woman, by name Lydia, a seller of purple, of  the city of Thyatira, worshipping God, was hearing, whose  heart the Lord did open to attend to the things spoken by  Paul;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:15">16:15</a> and when she was baptized, and her household, she did call  upon us, saying, `If ye have judged me to be faithful to the  Lord, having entered into my house, remain;' and she  constrained us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:16">16:16</a> And it came to pass in our going on to prayer, a certain  maid, having a spirit of Python, did meet us, who brought much  employment to her masters by soothsaying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:17">16:17</a> she having followed Paul and us, was crying, saying,  `These men are servants of the Most High God, who declare to us  a way of salvation;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:18">16:18</a> and this she was doing for many days, but Paul having been  grieved, and having turned, said to the spirit, `I command  thee, in the name of Jesus Christ, to come forth from her;'  and it came forth the same hour.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:19">16:19</a> And her masters having seen that the hope of their  employment was gone, having caught Paul and Silas, drew [them]  to the market-place, unto the rulers,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:20">16:20</a> and having brought them to the magistrates, they said,  `These men do exceedingly trouble our city, being Jews;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:21">16:21</a> and they proclaim customs that are not lawful for us to  receive nor to do, being Romans.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:22">16:22</a> And the multitude rose up together against them, and the  magistrates having torn their garments from them, were  commanding to beat [them] with rods,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:23">16:23</a> many blows also having laid upon them, they cast them to  prison, having given charge to the jailor to keep them safely,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:24">16:24</a> who such a charge having received, did put them to the  inner prison, and their feet made fast in the stocks.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:25">16:25</a> And at midnight Paul and Silas praying, were singing hymns  to God, and the prisoners were hearing them,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:26">16:26</a> and suddenly a great earthquake came, so that the  foundations of the prison were shaken, opened also presently  were all the doors, and of all -- the bands were loosed;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:27">16:27</a> and the jailor having come out of sleep, and having seen  the doors of the prison open, having drawn a sword, was about  to kill himself, supposing the prisoners to be fled,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:28">16:28</a> and Paul cried out with a loud voice, saying, `Thou mayest  not do thyself any harm, for we are all here.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:29">16:29</a> And, having asked for a light, he sprang in, and trembling  he fell down before Paul and Silas,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:30">16:30</a> and having brought them forth, said, `Sirs, what must I do  -- that I may be saved?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:31">16:31</a> and they said, `Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou  shalt be saved -- thou and thy house;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:32">16:32</a> and they spake to him the word of the Lord, and to all  those in his household;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:33">16:33</a> and having taken them, in that hour of the night, he did  bathe [them] from the blows, and was baptized, himself and all  his presently,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:34">16:34</a> having brought them also into his house, he set food  before [them], and was glad with all the household, he having  believed in God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:35">16:35</a> And day having come, the magistrates sent the rod-bearers,  saying, `Let those men go;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:36">16:36</a> and the jailor told these words unto Paul -- `The  magistrates have sent, that ye may be let go; now, therefore,  having gone forth go on in peace;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:37">16:37</a> and Paul said to them, `Having beaten us publicly  uncondemned -- men, Romans being -- they did cast [us] to  prison, and now privately do they cast us forth! why no! but  having come themselves, let them bring us forth.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:38">16:38</a> And the rod-bearers told to the magistrates these sayings,  and they were afraid, having heard that they are Romans,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:39">16:39</a> and having come, they besought them, and having brought  [them] forth, they were asking [them] to go forth from the  city;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:40">16:40</a> and they, having gone forth out of the prison, entered  into [the house of] Lydia, and having seen the brethren, they  comforted them, and went forth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:1">17:1</a> And having passed through Amphipolis, and Apollonia, they  came to Thessalonica, where was the synagogue of the Jews,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:2">17:2</a> and according to the custom of Paul, he went in unto them,  and for three sabbaths he was reasoning with them from the  Writings,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:3">17:3</a> opening and alleging, `That the Christ it behoved to  suffer, and to rise again out of the dead, and that this is  the Christ -- Jesus whom I proclaim to you.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:4">17:4</a> And certain of them did believe, and attached themselves to  Paul and to Silas, also of the worshipping Greeks a great  multitude, of the principal women also not a few.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:5">17:5</a> And the unbelieving Jews, having been moved with envy, and  having taken to them of the loungers certain evil men, and  having made a crowd, were setting the city in an uproar; having  assailed also the house of Jason, they were seeking them to  bring [them] to the populace,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:6">17:6</a> and not having found them, they drew Jason and certain  brethren unto the city rulers, calling aloud -- `These, having  put the world in commotion, are also here present,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:7">17:7</a> whom Jason hath received; and these all do contrary to the  decrees of Caesar, saying another to be king -- Jesus.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:8">17:8</a> And they troubled the multitude and the city rulers,  hearing these things,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:9">17:9</a> and having taking security from Jason and the rest, they  let them go.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:10">17:10</a> And the brethren immediately, through the night, sent  forth both Paul and Silas to Berea, who having come, went to  the synagogue of the Jews;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:11">17:11</a> and these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, they  received the word with all readiness of mind, every day  examining the Writings whether those things were so;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:12">17:12</a> many, indeed, therefore, of them did believe, and of the  honourable Greek women and men not a few.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:13">17:13</a> And when the Jews from Thessalonica knew that also in  Berea was the word of God declared by Paul, they came thither  also, agitating the multitudes;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:14">17:14</a> and then immediately the brethren sent forth Paul, to go  on as it were to the sea, but both Silas and Timothy were  remaining there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:15">17:15</a> And those conducting Paul, brought him unto Athens, and  having received a command unto Silas and Timotheus that with  all speed they may come unto him, they departed;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:16">17:16</a> and Paul waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was  stirred in him, beholding the city wholly given to idolatry,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:17">17:17</a> therefore, indeed, he was reasoning in the synagogue with  the Jews, and with the worshipping persons, and in the  market-place every day with those who met with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:18">17:18</a> And certain of the Epicurean and of the Stoic  philosophers, were meeting together to see him, and some were  saying, `What would this seed picker wish to say?' and others,  `Of strange demons he doth seem to be an announcer;' because  Jesus and the rising again he did proclaim to them as good  news,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:19">17:19</a> having also taken him, unto the Areopagus they brought  [him], saying, `Are we able to know what [is] this new teaching  that is spoken by thee,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:20">17:20</a> for certain strange things thou dost bring to our ears? we  wish, then, to know what these things would wish to be;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:21">17:21</a> and all Athenians, and the strangers sojourning, for  nothing else were at leisure but to say something, and to hear  some newer thing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:22">17:22</a> And Paul, having stood in the midst of the Areopagus,  said, `Men, Athenians, in all things I perceive you as  over-religious;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:23">17:23</a> for passing through and contemplating your objects of  worship, I found also an erection on which had been inscribed:  To God -- unknown; whom, therefore -- not knowing -- ye do  worship, this One I announce to you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:24">17:24</a> `God, who did make the world, and all things in it, this  One, of heaven and of earth being Lord, in temples made with  hands doth not dwell,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:25">17:25</a> neither by the hands of men is He served -- needing  anything, He giving to all life, and breath, and all things;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:26">17:26</a> He made also of one blood every nation of men, to dwell  upon all the face of the earth -- having ordained times before  appointed, and the bounds of their dwellings --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:27">17:27</a> to seek the Lord, if perhaps they did feel after Him and  find, -- though, indeed, He is not far from each one of us,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:28">17:28</a> for in Him we live, and move, and are; as also certain of  your poets have said: For of Him also we are offspring.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:29">17:29</a> `Being, therefore, offspring of God, we ought not to think  the Godhead to be like to gold, or silver, or stone, graving of  art and device of man;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:30">17:30</a> the times, indeed, therefore, of the ignorance God having  overlooked, doth now command all men everywhere to reform,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:31">17:31</a> because He did set a day in which He is about to judge the  world in righteousness, by a man whom He did ordain, having  given assurance to all, having raised him out of the dead.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:32">17:32</a> And having heard of a rising again of the dead, some,  indeed, were mocking, but others said, `We will hear thee again  concerning this;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:33">17:33</a> and so Paul went forth from the midst of them,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:34">17:34</a> and certain men having cleaved to him, did believe, among  whom [is] also Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman, by name  Damaris, and others with them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:1">18:1</a> And after these things, Paul having departed out of Athens,  came to Corinth,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:2">18:2</a> and having found a certain Jew, by name Aquilas, of Pontus  by birth, lately come from Italy, and Priscilla his wife --  because of Claudius having directed all the Jews to depart out  of Rome -- he came to them,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:3">18:3</a> and because of being of the same craft, he did remain with  them, and was working, for they were tent-makers as to craft;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:4">18:4</a> and he was reasoning in the synagogue every sabbath,  persuading both Jews and Greeks.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:5">18:5</a> And when both Silas and Timotheus came down from Macedonia,  Paul was pressed in the Spirit, testifying fully to the Jews  Jesus the Christ;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:6">18:6</a> and on their resisting and speaking evil, having shaken  [his] garments, he said unto them, `Your blood [is] upon your  head -- I am clean; henceforth to the nations I will go on.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:7">18:7</a> And having departed thence, he went to the house of a  certain one, by name Justus, a worshipper of God, whose house  was adjoining the synagogue,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:8">18:8</a> and Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue did believe in the  Lord with all his house, and many of the Corinthians hearing  were believing, and they were being baptized.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:9">18:9</a> And the Lord said through a vision in the night to Paul,  `Be not afraid, but be speaking and thou mayest be not silent;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:10">18:10</a> because I am with thee, and no one shall set on thee to do  thee evil; because I have much people in this city;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:11">18:11</a> and he continued a year and six months, teaching among  them the word of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:12">18:12</a> And Gallio being proconsul of Achaia, the Jews made a rush  with one accord upon Paul, and brought him unto the tribunal,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:13">18:13</a> saying -- `Against the law this one doth persuade men to  worship God;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:14">18:14</a> and Paul being about to open [his] mouth, Gallio said unto  the Jews, `If, indeed, then, it was anything unrighteous, or an  act of wicked profligacy, O Jews, according to reason I had  borne with you,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:15">18:15</a> but if it is a question concerning words and names, and of  your law, look ye yourselves [to it], for a judge of these  things I do not wish to be,'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:16">18:16</a> and he drave them from the tribunal;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:17">18:17</a> and all the Greeks having taken Sosthenes, the chief man  of the synagogue, were beating [him] before the tribunal, and  not even for these things was Gallio caring.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:18">18:18</a> And Paul having remained yet a good many days, having  taken leave of the brethren, was sailing to Syria -- and with  him [are] Priscilla and Aquilas -- having shorn [his] head in  Cenchera, for he had a vow;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:19">18:19</a> and he came down to Ephesus, and did leave them there, and  he himself having entered into the synagogue did reason with  the Jews:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:20">18:20</a> and they having requested [him] to remain a longer time  with them, he did not consent,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:21">18:21</a> but took leave of them, saying, `It behoveth me by all  means the coming feast to keep at Jerusalem, and again I will  return unto you -- God willing.' And he sailed from Ephesus,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:22">18:22</a> and having come down to Cesarea, having gone up, and  having saluted the assembly, he went down to Antioch.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:23">18:23</a> And having made some stay he went forth, going through in  order the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the  disciples.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:24">18:24</a> And a certain Jew, Apollos by name, an Alexandrian by  birth, a man of eloquence, being mighty in the Writings, came  to Ephesus,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:25">18:25</a> this one was instructed in the way of the Lord, and being  fervent in the Spirit, was speaking and teaching exactly the  things about the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:26">18:26</a> this one also began to speak boldly in the synagogue, and  Aquilas and Priscilla having heard of him, took him to [them],  and did more exactly expound to him the way of God,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:27">18:27</a> and he being minded to go through into Achaia, the  brethren wrote to the disciples, having exhorted them to  receive him, who having come, did help them much who have  believed through the grace,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:28">18:28</a> for powerfully the Jews he was refuting publicly, shewing  through the Writings Jesus to be the Christ.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:1">19:1</a> And it came to pass, in Apollos' being in Corinth, Paul  having gone through the upper parts, came to Ephesus, and  having found certain disciples,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:2">19:2</a> he said unto them, `The Holy Spirit did ye receive --  having believed?' and they said unto him, `But we did not even  hear whether there is any Holy Spirit;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:3">19:3</a> and he said unto them, `To what, then, were ye baptized?'  and they said, `To John's baptism.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:4">19:4</a> And Paul said, `John, indeed, did baptize with a baptism of  reformation, saying to the people that in him who is coming  after him they should believe -- that is, in the Christ --  Jesus;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:5">19:5</a> and they, having heard, were baptized -- to the name of the  Lord Jesus,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:6">19:6</a> and Paul having laid on them [his] hands, the Holy Spirit  came upon them, they were speaking also with tongues, and  prophesying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:7">19:7</a> and all the men were, as it were, twelve.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:8">19:8</a> And having gone into the synagogue, he was speaking boldly  for three months, reasoning and persuading the things  concerning the reign of God,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:9">19:9</a> and when certain were hardened and were disbelieving,  speaking evil of the way before the multitude, having departed  from them, he did separate the disciples, every day reasoning  in the school of a certain Tyrannus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:10">19:10</a> And this happened for two years so that all those dwelling  in Asia did hear the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and  Greeks,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:11">19:11</a> mighty works also -- not common -- was God working through  the hands of Paul,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:12">19:12</a> so that even unto the ailing were brought from his body  handkerchiefs or aprons, and the sicknesses departed from them;  the evil spirits also went forth from them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:13">19:13</a> And certain of the wandering exorcist Jews, took upon  [them] to name over those having the evil spirits the name of  the Lord Jesus, saying, `We adjure you by Jesus, whom Paul doth  preach;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:14">19:14</a> and there were certain -- seven sons of Sceva, a Jew, a  chief priest -- who are doing this thing;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:15">19:15</a> and the evil spirit, answering, said, `Jesus I know, and  Paul I am acquainted with; and ye -- who are ye?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:16">19:16</a> And the man, in whom was the evil spirit, leaping upon  them, and having overcome them, prevailed against them, so  that naked and wounded they did flee out of that house,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:17">19:17</a> and this became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, who  are dwelling at Ephesus, and fear fell upon them all, and the  name of the Lord Jesus was being magnified,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:18">19:18</a> many also of those who did believe were coming, confessing  and declaring their acts,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:19">19:19</a> and many of those who had practised the curious arts,  having brought the books together, were burning [them] before  all; and they reckoned together the prices of them, and found  [it] five myriads of silverlings;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:20">19:20</a> so powerfully was the word of God increasing and  prevailing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:21">19:21</a> And when these things were fulfilled, Paul purposed in the  Spirit, having gone through Macedonia and Achaia, to go on to  Jerusalem, saying -- `After my being there, it behoveth me also  to see Rome;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:22">19:22</a> and having sent to Macedonia two of those ministering to  him -- Timotheus and Erastus -- he himself stayed a time in  Asia.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:23">19:23</a> And there came, at that time, not a little stir about the  way,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:24">19:24</a> for a certain one, Demetrius by name, a worker in silver,  making silver sanctuaries of Artemis, was bringing to the  artificers gain not a little,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:25">19:25</a> whom, having brought in a crowd together, and those who  did work about such things, he said, `Men, ye know that by this  work we have our wealth;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:26">19:26</a> and ye see and hear, that not only at Ephesus, but almost  in all Asia, this Paul, having persuaded, did turn away a great  multitude, saying, that they are not gods who are made by  hands;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:27">19:27</a> and not only is this department in danger for us of coming  into disregard, but also, that of the great goddess Artemis the  temple is to be reckoned for nothing, and also her greatness is  about to be brought down, whom all Asia and the world doth  worship.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:28">19:28</a> And they having heard, and having become full of wrath,  were crying out, saying, `Great [is] the Artemis of the  Ephesians!'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:29">19:29</a> and the whole city was filled with confusion, they rushed  also with one accord into the theatre, having caught Gaius and  Aristarchus, Macedonians, Paul's fellow-travellers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:30">19:30</a> And on Paul's purposing to enter in unto the populace, the  disciples were not suffering him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:31">19:31</a> and certain also of the chief men of Asia, being his  friends, having sent unto him, were entreating him not to  venture himself into the theatre.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:32">19:32</a> Some indeed, therefore, were calling out one thing, and  some another, for the assembly was confused, and the greater  part did not know for what they were come together;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:33">19:33</a> and out of the multitude they put forward Alexander -- the  Jews thrusting him forward -- and Alexander having beckoned  with the hand, wished to make defence to the populace,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:34">19:34</a> and having known that he is a Jew, one voice came out of  all, for about two hours, crying, `Great [is] the Artemis of  the Ephesians!'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:35">19:35</a> And the public clerk having quieted the multitude, saith,  `Men, Ephesians, why, who is the man that doth not know that  the city of the Ephesians is a devotee of the great goddess  Artemis, and of that which fell down from Zeus?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:36">19:36</a> these things, then, not being to be gainsaid, it is  necessary for you to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:37">19:37</a> `For ye brought these men, who are neither temple-robbers  nor speaking evil of your goddess;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:38">19:38</a> if indeed, therefore, Demetrius and the artificers with  him with any one have a matter, court [days] are held, and  there are proconsuls; let them accuse one another.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:39">19:39</a> `And if ye seek after anything concerning other matters,  in the legal assembly it shall be determined;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:40">19:40</a> for we are also in peril of being accused of insurrection  in regard to this day, there being no occasion by which we  shall be able to give an account of this concourse;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:41">19:41</a> and these things having said, he dismissed the assembly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:1">20:1</a> And after the ceasing of the tumult, Paul having called  near the disciples, and having embraced [them], went forth to  go on to Macedonia;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:2">20:2</a> and having gone through those parts, and having exhorted  them with many words, he came to Greece;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:3">20:3</a> having made also three months' [stay] -- a counsel of the  Jews having been against him -- being about to set forth to  Syria, there came [to him] a resolution of returning through  Macedonia.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:4">20:4</a> And there were accompanying him unto Asia, Sopater of  Berea, and of Thessalonians Aristarchus and Secundus, and  Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus, and of Asiatics Tychicus and  Trophimus;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:5">20:5</a> these, having gone before, did remain for us in Troas,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:6">20:6</a> and we sailed, after the days of the unleavened food, from  Philippi, and came unto them to Troas in five days, where we  abode seven days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:7">20:7</a> And on the first of the week, the disciples having been  gathered together to break bread, Paul was discoursing to  them, about to depart on the morrow, he was also continuing  the discourse till midnight,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:8">20:8</a> and there were many lamps in the upper chamber where they  were gathered together,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:9">20:9</a> and there was sitting a certain youth, by name Eutychus,  upon the window -- being borne down by a deep sleep, Paul  discoursing long -- he having sunk down from the sleep, fell  down from the third story, and was lifted up dead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:10">20:10</a> And Paul, having gone down, fell upon him, and having  embraced [him], said, `Make no tumult, for his life is in  him;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:11">20:11</a> and having come up, and having broken bread, and having  tasted, for a long time also having talked -- till daylight,  so he went forth,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:12">20:12</a> and they brought up the lad alive, and were comforted in  no ordinary measure.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:13">20:13</a> And we having gone before unto the ship, did sail to  Assos, thence intending to take in Paul, for so he had  arranged, intending himself to go on foot;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:14">20:14</a> and when he met with us at Assos, having taken him up, we  came to Mitylene,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:15">20:15</a> and thence having sailed, on the morrow we came  over-against Chios, and the next day we arrived at Samos, and  having remained in Trogyllium, on the following day we came to  Miletus,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:16">20:16</a> for Paul decided to sail past Ephesus, that there may not  be to him a loss of time in Asia, for he hasted, if it were  possible for him, on the day of the Pentecost to be at  Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:17">20:17</a> And from Miletus, having sent to Ephesus, he called for  the elders of the assembly,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:18">20:18</a> and when they were come unto him, he said to them, `Ye --  ye know from the first day in which I came to Asia, how, with  you at all times I was;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:19">20:19</a> serving the Lord with all humility, and many tears, and  temptations, that befell me in the counsels of the Jews against  [me];</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:20">20:20</a> how nothing I did keep back of what things are profitable,  not to declare to you, and to teach you publicly, and in every  house,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:21">20:21</a> testifying fully both to Jews and Greeks, toward God  reformation, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:22">20:22</a> `And now, lo, I -- bound in the Spirit -- go on to  Jerusalem, the things that shall befall me in it not knowing,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:23">20:23</a> save that the Holy Spirit in every city doth testify  fully, saying, that for me bonds and tribulations remain;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:24">20:24</a> but I make account of none of these, neither do I count my  life precious to myself, so that I finish my course with joy,  and the ministration that I received from the Lord Jesus, to  testify fully the good news of the grace of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:25">20:25</a> `And now, lo, I have known that no more shall ye see my  face, -- ye all among whom I did go preaching the reign of God;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:26">20:26</a> wherefore I take you to witness this day, that I [am]  clear from the blood of all,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:27">20:27</a> for I did not keep back from declaring to you all the  counsel of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:28">20:28</a> `Take heed, therefore, to yourselves, and to all the  flock, among which the Holy Spirit made you overseers, to feed  the assembly of God that He acquired through His own blood,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:29">20:29</a> for I have known this, that there shall enter in, after my  departing, grievous wolves unto you, not sparing the flock,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:30">20:30</a> and of your own selves there shall arise men, speaking  perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:31">20:31</a> `Therefore, watch, remembering that three years, night and  day, I did not cease with tears warning each one;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:32">20:32</a> and now, I commend you, brethren, to God, and to the word  of His grace, that is able to build up, and to give you an  inheritance among all those sanctified.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:33">20:33</a> `The silver or gold or garments of no one did I covet;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:34">20:34</a> and ye yourselves know that to my necessities, and to  those who were with me, minister did these hands;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:35">20:35</a> all things I did shew you, that, thus labouring, it  behoveth [us] to partake with the ailing, to be mindful also of  the words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said, It is more  blessed to give than to receive.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:36">20:36</a> And these things having said, having bowed his knees, with  them all, he did pray,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:37">20:37</a> and there came a great weeping to all, and having fallen  upon the neck of Paul, they were kissing him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:38">20:38</a> sorrowing most of all for the word that he had said --  that they are about no more to see his face; and they were  accompanying him to the ship.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:1">21:1</a> And it came to pass, at our sailing, having been parted  from them, having run direct, we came to Coos, and the  succeeding [day] to Rhodes, and thence to Patara,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:2">21:2</a> and having found a ship passing over to Phenicia, having  gone on board, we sailed,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:3">21:3</a> and having discovered Cyprus, and having left it on the  left, we were sailing to Syria, and did land at Tyre, for there  was the ship discharging the lading.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:4">21:4</a> And having found out the disciples, we tarried there seven  days, and they said to Paul, through the Spirit, not to go up  to Jerusalem;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:5">21:5</a> but when it came that we completed the days, having gone  forth, we went on, all bringing us on the way, with women and  children, unto the outside of the city, and having bowed the  knees upon the shore, we prayed,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:6">21:6</a> and having embraced one another, we embarked in the ship,  and they returned to their own friends.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:7">21:7</a> And we, having finished the course, from Tyre came down to  Ptolemais, and having saluted the brethren, we remained one  day with them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:8">21:8</a> and on the morrow Paul and his company having gone forth,  we came to Cesarea, and having entered into the house of  Philip the evangelist -- who is of the seven -- we remained  with him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:9">21:9</a> and this one had four daughters, virgins, prophesying.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:10">21:10</a> And we remaining many more days, there came down a certain  one from Judea, a prophet, by name Agabus,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:11">21:11</a> and he having come unto us, and having taken up the girdle  of Paul, having bound also his own hands and feet, said, `Thus  saith the Holy Spirit, The man whose is this girdle -- so  shall the Jews in Jerusalem bind, and they shall deliver [him]  up to the hands of nations.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:12">21:12</a> And when we heard these things, we called upon [him] --  both we, and those of that place -- not to go up to Jerusalem,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:13">21:13</a> and Paul answered, `What do ye -- weeping, and crushing  mine heart? for I, not only to be bound, but also to die at  Jerusalem, am ready, for the name of the Lord Jesus;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:14">21:14</a> and he not being persuaded, we were silent, saying, `The  will of the Lord be done.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:15">21:15</a> And after these days, having taken [our] vessels, we were  going up to Jerusalem,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:16">21:16</a> and there went also of the disciples from Cesarea with us,  bringing with them him with whom we may lodge, a certain  Mnason of Cyprus, an aged disciple.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:17">21:17</a> And we having come to Jerusalem, the brethren did gladly  receive us,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:18">21:18</a> and on the morrow Paul was going in with us unto James,  all the elders also came,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:19">21:19</a> and having saluted them, he was declaring, one by one,  each of the things God did among the nations through his  ministration,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:20">21:20</a> and they having heard, were glorifying the Lord. They said  also to him, `Thou seest, brother, how many myriads there are  of Jews who have believed, and all are zealous of the law,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:21">21:21</a> and they are instructed concerning thee, that apostacy  from Moses thou dost teach to all Jews among the nations,  saying -- Not to circumcise the children, nor after the customs  to walk;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:22">21:22</a> what then is it? certainly the multitude it behoveth to  come together, for they will hear that thou hast come.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:23">21:23</a> `This, therefore, do that we say to thee: We have four men  having a vow on themselves,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:24">21:24</a> these having taken, be purified with them, and be at  expence with them, that they may shave the head, and all may  know that the things of which they have been instructed  concerning thee are nothing, but thou dost walk -- thyself also  -- the law keeping.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:25">21:25</a> `And concerning those of the nations who have believed, we  have written, having given judgment, that they observe no such  thing, except to keep themselves both from idol-sacrifices,  and blood, and a strangled thing, and whoredom.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:26">21:26</a> Then Paul, having taken the men, on the following day,  with them having purified himself, was entering into the  temple, announcing the fulfilment of the days of the  purification, till the offering was offered for each one of  them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:27">21:27</a> And, as the seven days were about to be fully ended, the  Jews from Asia having beheld him in the temple, were stirring  up all the multitude, and they laid hands upon him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:28">21:28</a> crying out, `Men, Israelites, help! this is the man who,  against the people, and the law, and this place, all everywhere  is teaching; and further, also, Greeks he brought into the  temple, and hath defiled this holy place;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:29">21:29</a> for they had seen before Trophimus, the Ephesian, in the  city with him, whom they were supposing that Paul brought into  the temple.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:30">21:30</a> All the city also was moved and there was a running  together of the people, and having laid hold on Paul, they were  drawing him out of the temple, and immediately were the doors  shut,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:31">21:31</a> and they seeking to kill him, a rumour came to the chief  captain of the band that all Jerusalem hath been thrown into  confusion,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:32">21:32</a> who, at once, having taken soldiers and centurions, ran  down upon them, and they having seen the chief captain and the  soldiers, did leave off beating Paul.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:33">21:33</a> Then the chief captain, having come nigh, took him, and  commanded [him] to be bound with two chains, and was inquiring  who he may be, and what it is he hath been doing,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:34">21:34</a> and some were crying out one thing, and some another,  among the multitude, and not being able to know the certainty  because of the tumult, he commanded him to be carried to the  castle,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:35">21:35</a> and when he came upon the steps, it happened he was borne  by the soldiers, because of the violence of the multitude,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:36">21:36</a> for the crowd of the people was following after, crying,  `Away with him.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:37">21:37</a> And Paul being about to be led into the castle, saith to  the chief captain, `Is it permitted to me to say anything unto  thee?' and he said, `Greek dost thou know?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:38">21:38</a> art not thou, then, the Egyptian who before these days  made an uprising, and did lead into the desert the four  thousand men of the assassins?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:39">21:39</a> And Paul said, `I, indeed, am a man, a Jew, of Tarsus of  Cilicia, of no mean city a citizen; and I beseech thee, suffer  me to speak unto the people.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:40">21:40</a> And he having given him leave, Paul having stood upon the  stairs, did beckon with the hand to the people, and there  having been a great silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew  dialect, saying:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:1">22:1</a> `Men, brethren, and fathers, hear my defence now unto you;'  --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:2">22:2</a> and they having heard that in the Hebrew dialect he was  speaking to them, gave the more silence, and he saith, --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:3">22:3</a> `I, indeed, am a man, a Jew, having been born in Tarsus of  Cilicia, and brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel,  having been taught according to the exactitude of a law of the  fathers, being zealous of God, as all ye are to-day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:4">22:4</a> `And this way I persecuted unto death, binding and  delivering up to prisons both men and women,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:5">22:5</a> as also the chief priest doth testify to me, and all the  eldership; from whom also having received letters unto the  brethren, to Damascus, I was going on, to bring also those  there bound to Jerusalem that they might be punished,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:6">22:6</a> and it came to pass, in my going on and coming nigh to  Damascus, about noon, suddenly out of the heaven there shone a  great light round about me,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:7">22:7</a> I fell also to the ground, and I heard a voice saying to  me, Saul, Saul, why me dost thou persecute?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:8">22:8</a> `And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? and he said unto me, I  am Jesus the Nazarene whom thou dost persecute --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:9">22:9</a> and they who are with me the light did see, and became  afraid, and the voice they heard not of him who is speaking to  me --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:10">22:10</a> and I said, What shall I do, Lord? and the Lord said unto  me, Having risen, go on to Damascus, and there it shall be told  thee concerning all things that have been appointed for thee to  do.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:11">22:11</a> `And when I did not see from the glory of that light,  being led by the hand by those who are with me, I came to  Damascus,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:12">22:12</a> and a certain one, Ananias, a pious man according to the  law, being testified to by all the Jews dwelling [there],</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:13">22:13</a> having come unto me and stood by [me], said to me, Saul,  brother, look up; and I the same hour did look up to him;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:14">22:14</a> and he said, The God of our fathers did choose thee  beforehand to know His will, and to see the Righteous One, and  to hear a voice out of his mouth,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:15">22:15</a> because thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what  thou hast seen and heard;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:16">22:16</a> and now, why tarriest thou? having risen, baptize thyself,  and wash away thy sins, calling upon the name of the Lord.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:17">22:17</a> `And it came to pass when I returned to Jerusalem, and  while I was praying in the temple, I came into a trance,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:18">22:18</a> and I saw him saying to me, Haste and go forth in haste  out of Jerusalem, because they will not receive thy testimony  concerning me;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:19">22:19</a> and I said, Lord, they -- they know that I was imprisoning  and was scourging in every synagogue those believing on thee;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:20">22:20</a> and when the blood of thy witness Stephen was being poured  forth, I also was standing by and assenting to his death, and  keeping the garments of those putting him to death;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:21">22:21</a> and he said unto me, Go, because to nations far off I will  send thee.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:22">22:22</a> And they were hearing him unto this word, and they lifted  up their voice, saying, `Away from the earth with such an one;  for it is not fit for him to live.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:23">22:23</a> And they crying out and casting up their garments, and  throwing dust into the air,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:24">22:24</a> the chief captain commanded him to be brought into the  castle, saying, `By scourges let him be examined;' that he  might know for what cause they were crying so against him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:25">22:25</a> And as he was stretching him with the thongs, Paul said  unto the centurion who was standing by, `A man, a Roman,  uncondemned -- is it lawful to you to scourge;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:26">22:26</a> and the centurion having heard, having gone near to the  chief captain, told, saying, `Take heed what thou art about to  do, for this man is a Roman;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:27">22:27</a> and the chief captain having come near, said to him, `Tell  me, art thou a Roman?' and he said, `Yes;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:28">22:28</a> and the chief captain answered, `I, with a great sum, did  obtain this citizenship;' but Paul said, `But I have been even  born [so].'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:29">22:29</a> Immediately, therefore, they departed from him who are  about to examine him, and the chief captain also was afraid,  having learned that he is a Roman, and because he had bound  him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:30">22:30</a> and on the morrow, intending to know the certainty  wherefore he is accused by the Jews, he did loose him from the  bonds, and commanded the chief priests and all their sanhedrim  to come, and having brought down Paul, he set [him] before  them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:1">23:1</a> And Paul having earnestly beheld the sanhedrim, said, `Men,  brethren, I in all good conscience have lived to God unto this  day;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:2">23:2</a> and the chief priest Ananias commanded those standing by  him to smite him on the mouth,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:3">23:3</a> then Paul said unto him, `God is about to smite thee, thou  whitewashed wall, and thou -- thou dost sit judging me  according to the law, and, violating law, dost order me to be  smitten!'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:4">23:4</a> And those who stood by said, `The chief priest of God dost  thou revile?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:5">23:5</a> and Paul said, `I did not know, brethren, that he is chief  priest: for it hath been written, Of the ruler of thy people  thou shalt not speak evil;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:6">23:6</a> and Paul having known that the one part are Sadducees, and  the other Pharisees, cried out in the sanhedrim, `Men,  brethren, I am a Pharisee -- son of a Pharisee -- concerning  hope and rising again of dead men I am judged.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:7">23:7</a> And he having spoken this, there came a dissension of the  Pharisees and of the Sadducees, and the crowd was divided,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:8">23:8</a> for Sadducees, indeed, say there is no rising again, nor  messenger, nor spirit, but Pharisees confess both.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:9">23:9</a> And there came a great cry, and the scribes of the  Pharisees' part having arisen, were striving, saying, `No evil  do we find in this man; and if a spirit spake to him, or a  messenger, we may not fight against God;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:10">23:10</a> and a great dissension having come, the chief captain  having been afraid lest Paul may be pulled to pieces by them,  commanded the soldiery, having gone down, to take him by force  out of the midst of them, and to bring [him] to the castle.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:11">23:11</a> And on the following night, the Lord having stood by him,  said, `Take courage, Paul, for as thou didst fully testify the  things concerning me at Jerusalem, so it behoveth thee also at  Rome to testify.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:12">23:12</a> And day having come, certain of the Jews having made a  concourse, did anathematize themselves, saying neither to eat  nor to drink till they may kill Paul;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:13">23:13</a> and they were more than forty who made this conspiracy by  oath,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:14">23:14</a> who having come near to the chief priests and to the  elders said, `With an anathema we did anathematize ourselves --  to taste nothing till we have killed Paul;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:15">23:15</a> now, therefore, ye, signify ye to the chief captain, with  the sanhedrim, that to-morrow he may bring him down unto you,  as being about to know more exactly the things concerning him;  and we, before his coming nigh, are ready to put him to  death.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:16">23:16</a> And the son of Paul's sister having heard of the lying in  wait, having gone and entered into the castle, told Paul,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:17">23:17</a> and Paul having called near one of the centurions, said,  `This young man lead unto the chief captain, for he hath  something to tell him.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:18">23:18</a> He indeed, then, having taken him, brought him unto the  chief captain, and saith, `The prisoner Paul, having called me  near, asked [me] this young man to bring unto thee, having  something to say to thee.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:19">23:19</a> And the chief captain having taken him by the hand, and  having withdrawn by themselves, inquired, `What is that which  thou hast to tell me?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:20">23:20</a> and he said -- `The Jews agreed to request thee, that  to-morrow to the sanhedrim thou mayest bring down Paul, as  being about to enquire something more exactly concerning him;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:21">23:21</a> thou, therefore, mayest thou not yield to them, for there  lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, who did  anathematize themselves -- not to eat nor to drink till they  kill him, and now they are ready, waiting for the promise from  thee.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:22">23:22</a> The chief captain, then, indeed, let the young man go,  having charged [him] to tell no one, `that these things thou  didst shew unto me;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:23">23:23</a> and having called near a certain two of the centurions, he  said, `Make ready soldiers two hundred, that they may go on  unto Caesarea, and horsemen seventy, and spearmen two hundred,  from the third hour of the night;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:24">23:24</a> beasts also provide, that, having set Paul on, they may  bring him safe unto Felix the governor;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:25">23:25</a> he having written a letter after this description:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:26">23:26</a> `Claudius Lysias, to the most noble governor Felix, hail:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:27">23:27</a> This man having been taken by the Jews, and being about to  be killed by them -- having come with the soldiery, I rescued  him, having learned that he is a Roman;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:28">23:28</a> and, intending to know the cause for which they were  accusing him, I brought him down to their sanhedrim,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:29">23:29</a> whom I found accused concerning questions of their law,  and having no accusation worthy of death or bonds;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:30">23:30</a> and a plot having been intimated to me against this man --  about to be of the Jews -- at once I sent unto thee, having  given command also to the accusers to say the things against  him before thee; be strong.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:31">23:31</a> Then, indeed, the soldiers according to that directed  them, having taken up Paul, brought him through the night to  Antipatris,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:32">23:32</a> and on the morrow, having suffered the horsemen to go on  with him, they returned to the castle;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:33">23:33</a> those having entered into Caesarea, and delivered the  letter to the governor, did present also Paul to him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:34">23:34</a> And the governor having read [it], and inquired of what  province he is, and understood that [he is] from Cilicia;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:35">23:35</a> `I will hear thee -- said he -- when thine accusers also  may have come;' he also commanded him to be kept in the  praetorium of Herod.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:1">24:1</a> And after five days came down the chief priest Ananias,  with the elders, and a certain orator -- Tertullus, and they  made manifest to the governor [the things] against Paul;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:2">24:2</a> and he having been called, Tertullus began to accuse [him],  saying, `Much peace enjoying through thee, and worthy deeds  being done to this nation through thy forethought,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:3">24:3</a> always, also, and everywhere we receive it, most noble  Felix, with all thankfulness;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:4">24:4</a> and that I may not be further tedious to thee, I pray thee  to hear us concisely in thy gentleness;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:5">24:5</a> for having found this man a pestilence, and moving a  dissension to all the Jews through the world -- a ringleader  also of the sect of the Nazarenes --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:6">24:6</a> who also the temple did try to profane, whom also we took,  and according to our law did wish to judge,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:7">24:7</a> and Lysias the chief captain having come near, with much  violence, out of our hands did take away,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:8">24:8</a> having commanded his accusers to come to thee, from whom  thou mayest be able, thyself having examined, to know  concerning all these things of which we accuse him;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:9">24:9</a> and the Jews also agreed, professing these things to be so.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:10">24:10</a> And Paul answered -- the governor having beckoned to him  to speak -- `Knowing [that] for many years thou hast been a  judge to this nation, the more cheerfully the things concerning  myself I do answer;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:11">24:11</a> thou being able to know that it is not more than twelve  days to me since I went up to worship in Jerusalem,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:12">24:12</a> and neither in the temple did they find me reasoning with  any one, or making a dissension of the multitude, nor in the  synagogues, nor in the city;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:13">24:13</a> nor are they able to prove against me the things  concerning which they now accuse me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:14">24:14</a> `And I confess this to thee, that, according to the way  that they call a sect, so serve I the God of the fathers,  believing all things that in the law and the prophets have  been written,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:15">24:15</a> having hope toward God, which they themselves also wait  for, [that] there is about to be a rising again of the dead,  both of righteous and unrighteous;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:16">24:16</a> and in this I do exercise myself, to have a conscience  void of offence toward God and men always.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:17">24:17</a> `And after many years I came, about to do kind acts to my  nation, and offerings,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:18">24:18</a> in which certain Jews from Asia did find me purified in  the temple, not with multitude, nor with tumult,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:19">24:19</a> whom it behoveth to be present before thee, and to accuse,  if they had anything against me,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:20">24:20</a> or let these same say if they found any unrighteousness in  me in my standing before the sanhedrim,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:21">24:21</a> except concerning this one voice, in which I cried,  standing among them -- Concerning a rising again of the dead I  am judged to-day by you.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:22">24:22</a> And having heard these things, Felix delayed them --  having known more exactly of the things concerning the way --  saying, `When Lysias the chief captain may come down, I will  know fully the things concerning you;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:23">24:23</a> having given also a direction to the centurion to keep  Paul, to let [him] also have liberty, and to forbid none of his  own friends to minister or to come near to him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:24">24:24</a> And after certain days, Felix having come with Drusilla  his wife, being a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him  concerning the faith toward Christ,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:25">24:25</a> and he reasoning concerning righteousness, and temperance,  and the judgment that is about to be, Felix, having become  afraid, answered, `For the present be going, and having got  time, I will call for thee;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:26">24:26</a> and at the same time also hoping that money shall be given  to him by Paul, that he may release him, therefore, also  sending for him the oftener, he was conversing with him;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:27">24:27</a> and two years having been fulfilled, Felix received a  successor, Porcius Festus; Felix also willing to lay a favour  on the Jews, left Paul bound.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:1">25:1</a> Festus, therefore, having come into the province, after  three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:2">25:2</a> and the chief priest and the principal men of the Jews made  manifest to him [the things] against Paul, and were calling on  him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:3">25:3</a> asking favour against him, that he may send for him to  Jerusalem, making an ambush to put him to death in the way.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:4">25:4</a> Then, indeed, Festus answered that Paul is kept in  Caesarea, and himself is about speedily to go on thither,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:5">25:5</a> `Therefore those able among you -- saith he -- having come  down together, if there be anything in this man -- let them  accuse him;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:6">25:6</a> and having tarried among them more than ten days, having  gone down to Caesarea, on the morrow having sat upon the  tribunal, he commanded Paul to be brought;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:7">25:7</a> and he having come, there stood round about the Jews who  have come down from Jerusalem -- many and weighty charges they  are bringing against Paul, which they were not able to prove,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:8">25:8</a> he making defence -- `Neither in regard to the law of the  Jews, nor in regard to the temple, nor in regard to Caesar --  did I commit any sin.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:9">25:9</a> And Festus willing to lay on the Jews a favour, answering  Paul, said, `Art thou willing, to Jerusalem having gone up,  there concerning these things to be judged before me?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:10">25:10</a> and Paul said, `At the tribunal of Caesar I am standing,  where it behoveth me to be judged; to Jews I did no  unrighteousness, as thou dost also very well know;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:11">25:11</a> for if indeed I am unrighteous, and anything worthy of  death have done, I deprecate not to die; and if there is none  of the things of which these accuse me, no one is able to make  a favour of me to them; to Caesar I appeal!'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:12">25:12</a> then Festus, having communed with the council, answered,  `To Caesar thou hast appealed; to Caesar thou shalt go.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:13">25:13</a> And certain days having passed, Agrippa the king, and  Bernice, came down to Caesarea saluting Festus,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:14">25:14</a> and as they were continuing there more days, Festus  submitted to the king the things concerning Paul, saying,  `There is a certain man, left by Felix, a prisoner,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:15">25:15</a> about whom, in my being at Jerusalem, the chief priests  and the elders of the Jews laid information, asking a decision  against him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:16">25:16</a> unto whom I answered, that it is not a custom of Romans to  make a favour of any man to die, before that he who is accused  may have the accusers face to face, and may receive place of  defence in regard to the charge laid against [him].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:17">25:17</a> `They, therefore, having come together -- I, making no  delay, on the succeeding [day] having sat upon the tribunal,  did command the man to be brought,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:18">25:18</a> concerning whom the accusers, having stood up, were  bringing against [him] no accusation of the things I was  thinking of,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:19">25:19</a> but certain questions concerning their own religion they  had against him, and concerning a certain Jesus who was dead,  whom Paul affirmed to be alive;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:20">25:20</a> and I, doubting in regard to the question concerning this,  said, If he would wish to go on to Jerusalem, and there to be  judged concerning these things --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:21">25:21</a> but Paul having appealed to be kept to the hearing of  Sebastus, I did command him to be kept till I might send him  unto Caesar.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:22">25:22</a> And Agrippa said unto Festus, `I was wishing also myself  to hear the man;' and he said, `To-morrow thou shalt hear him;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:23">25:23</a> on the morrow, therefore -- on the coming of Agrippa and  Bernice with much display, and they having entered into the  audience chamber, with the chief captains also, and the  principal men of the city, and Festus having ordered -- Paul  was brought forth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:24">25:24</a> And Festus said, `King Agrippa, and all men who are  present with us, ye see this one, about whom all the multitude  of the Jews did deal with me, both in Jerusalem and here,  crying out, He ought not to live any longer;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:25">25:25</a> and I, having found him to have done nothing worthy of  death, and he also himself having appealed to Sebastus, I  decided to send him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:26">25:26</a> concerning whom I have no certain thing to write to [my]  lord, wherefore I brought him forth before you, and specially  before thee, king Agrippa, that the examination having been  made, I may have something to write;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:27">25:27</a> for it doth seem to me irrational, sending a prisoner, not  also to signify the charges against him.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:1">26:1</a> And Agrippa said unto Paul, `It is permitted to thee to  speak for thyself;' then Paul having stretched forth the hand,  was making a defence:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:2">26:2</a> `Concerning all things of which I am accused by Jews, king  Agrippa, I have thought myself happy, being about to make a  defence before thee to-day,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:3">26:3</a> especially knowing thee to be acquainted with all things --  both customs and questions -- among Jews; wherefore, I beseech  thee, patiently to hear me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:4">26:4</a> `The manner of my life then, indeed, from youth -- which  from the beginning was among my nation, in Jerusalem -- know do  all the Jews,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:5">26:5</a> knowing me before from the first, (if they may be willing  to testify,) that after the most exact sect of our worship, I  lived a Pharisee;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:6">26:6</a> and now for the hope of the promise made to the fathers by  God, I have stood judged,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:7">26:7</a> to which our twelve tribes, intently night and day serving,  do hope to come, concerning which hope I am accused, king  Agrippa, by the Jews;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:8">26:8</a> why is it judged incredible with you, if God doth raise the  dead?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:9">26:9</a> `I, indeed, therefore, thought with myself, that against  the name of Jesus of Nazareth it behoved [me] many things to  do,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:10">26:10</a> which also I did in Jerusalem, and many of the saints I in  prison did shut up, from the chief priests having received the  authority; they also being put to death, I gave my vote against  them,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:11">26:11</a> and in every synagogue, often punishing them, I was  constraining [them] to speak evil, being also exceedingly mad  against them, I was also persecuting [them] even unto strange  cities.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:12">26:12</a> `In which things, also, going on to Damascus -- with  authority and commission from the chief priests --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:13">26:13</a> at mid-day, I saw in the way, O king, out of heaven, above  the brightness of the sun, shining round about me a light --  and those going on with me;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:14">26:14</a> and we all having fallen to the earth, I heard a voice  speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew dialect, Saul, Saul,  why me dost thou persecute? hard for thee against pricks to  kick!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:15">26:15</a> `And I said, Who art thou, Lord? and he said, I am Jesus  whom thou dost persecute;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:16">26:16</a> but rise, and stand upon thy feet, for for this I appeared  to thee, to appoint thee an officer and a witness both of the  things thou didst see, and of the things [in which] I will  appear to thee,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:17">26:17</a> delivering thee from the people, and the nations, to whom  now I send thee,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:18">26:18</a> to open their eyes, to turn [them] from darkness to light,  and [from] the authority of the Adversary unto God, for their  receiving forgiveness of sins, and a lot among those having  been sanctified, by faith that [is] toward me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:19">26:19</a> `Whereupon, king Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the  heavenly vision,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:20">26:20</a> but to those in Damascus first, and to those in Jerusalem,  to all the region also of Judea, and to the nations, I was  preaching to reform, and to turn back unto God, doing works  worthy of reformation;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:21">26:21</a> because of these things the Jews -- having caught me in  the temple -- were endeavouring to kill [me].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:22">26:22</a> `Having obtained, therefore, help from God, till this day,  I have stood witnessing both to small and to great, saying  nothing besides the things that both the prophets and Moses  spake of as about to come,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:23">26:23</a> that the Christ is to suffer, whether first by a rising  from the dead, he is about to proclaim light to the people and  to the nations.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:24">26:24</a> And, he thus making a defence, Festus with a loud voice  said, `Thou art mad, Paul; much learning doth turn thee mad;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:25">26:25</a> and he saith, `I am not mad, most noble Festus, but of  truth and soberness the sayings I speak forth;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:26">26:26</a> for the king doth know concerning these things, before  whom also I speak boldly, for none of these things, I am  persuaded, are hidden from him; for this thing hath not been  done in a corner;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:27">26:27</a> thou dost believe, king Agrippa, the prophets? I have  known that thou dost believe!'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:28">26:28</a> And Agrippa said unto Paul, `In a little thou dost  persuade me to become a Christian!'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:29">26:29</a> and Paul said, `I would have wished to God, both in a  little, and in much, not only thee, but also all those hearing  me to-day, to become such as I also am -- except these bonds.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:30">26:30</a> And, he having spoken these things, the king rose up, and  the governor, Bernice also, and those sitting with them,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:31">26:31</a> and having withdrawn, they were speaking unto one another,  saying -- `This man doth nothing worthy of death or of bonds;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:32">26:32</a> and Agrippa said to Festus, `This man might have been  released if he had not appealed to Caesar.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:1">27:1</a> And when our sailing to Italy was determined, they were  delivering up both Paul and certain others, prisoners, to a  centurion, by name Julius, of the band of Sebastus,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:2">27:2</a> and having embarked in a ship of Adramyttium, we, being  about to sail by the coasts of Asia, did set sail, there being  with us Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:3">27:3</a> on the next [day] also we touched at Sidon, and Julius,  courteously treating Paul, did permit [him], having gone on  unto friends, to receive [their] care.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:4">27:4</a> And thence, having set sail, we sailed under Cyprus,  because of the winds being contrary,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:5">27:5</a> and having sailed over the sea over-against Cilicia and  Pamphylia, we came to Myria of Lycia,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:6">27:6</a> and there the centurion having found a ship of Alexandria,  sailing to Italy, did put us into it,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:7">27:7</a> and having sailed slowly many days, and with difficulty  coming over-against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we  sailed under Crete, over-against Salmone,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:8">27:8</a> and hardly passing it, we came to a certain place called  `Fair Havens,' nigh to which was the city [of] Lasaea.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:9">27:9</a> And much time being spent, and the sailing being now  dangerous -- because of the fast also being already past --  Paul was admonishing,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:10">27:10</a> saying to them, `Men, I perceive that with hurt, and much  damage, not only of the lading and of the ship, but also of  our lives -- the voyage is about to be;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:11">27:11</a> but the centurion to the pilot and to the shipowner gave  credence more than to the things spoken by Paul;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:12">27:12</a> and the haven being incommodious to winter in, the more  part gave counsel to sail thence also, if by any means they  might be able, having attained to Phenice, [there] to winter,  [which is] a haven of Crete, looking to the south-west and  north-west,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:13">27:13</a> and a south wind blowing softly, having thought they had  obtained [their] purpose, having lifted anchor, they sailed  close by Crete,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:14">27:14</a> and not long after there arose against it a tempestuous  wind, that is called Euroclydon,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:15">27:15</a> and the ship being caught, and not being able to bear up  against the wind, having given [her] up, we were borne on,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:16">27:16</a> and having run under a certain little isle, called Clauda,  we were hardly able to become masters of the boat,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:17">27:17</a> which having taken up, they were using helps, undergirding  the ship, and fearing lest they may fall on the quicksand,  having let down the mast -- so were borne on.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:18">27:18</a> And we, being exceedingly tempest-tossed, the succeeding  [day] they were making a clearing,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:19">27:19</a> and on the third [day] with our own hands the tackling of  the ship we cast out,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:20">27:20</a> and neither sun nor stars appearing for more days, and not  a little tempest lying upon us, thenceforth all hope was taken  away of our being saved.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:21">27:21</a> And there having been long fasting, then Paul having stood  in the midst of them, said, `It behoved [you], indeed, O men  -- having hearkened to me -- not to set sail from Crete, and to  save this hurt and damage;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:22">27:22</a> and now I exhort you to be of good cheer, for there shall  be no loss of life among you -- but of the ship;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:23">27:23</a> for there stood by me this night a messenger of God --  whose I am, and whom I serve --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:24">27:24</a> saying, Be not afraid Paul; before Caesar it behoveth thee  to stand; and, lo, God hath granted to thee all those sailing  with thee;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:25">27:25</a> wherefore be of good cheer, men! for I believe God, that  so it shall be, even as it hath been spoken to me,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:26">27:26</a> and on a certain island it behoveth us to be cast.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:27">27:27</a> And when the fourteenth night came -- we being borne up  and down in the Adria -- toward the middle of the night the  sailors were supposing that some country drew nigh to them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:28">27:28</a> and having sounded they found twenty fathoms, and having  gone a little farther, and again having sounded, they found  fifteen fathoms,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:29">27:29</a> and fearing lest on rough places we may fall, out of the  stern having cast four anchors, they were wishing day to come.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:30">27:30</a> And the sailors seeking to flee out of the ship, and  having let down the boat to the sea, in pretence as [if] out of  the foreship they are about to cast anchors,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:31">27:31</a> Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, `If these  do not remain in the ship -- ye are not able to be saved;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:32">27:32</a> then the soldiers did cut off the ropes of the boat, and  suffered it to fall off.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:33">27:33</a> And till the day was about to be, Paul was calling upon  all to partake of nourishment, saying, `Fourteen days to-day,  waiting, ye continue fasting, having taken nothing,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:34">27:34</a> wherefore I call upon you to take nourishment, for this is  for your safety, for of not one of you shall a hair from the  head fall;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:35">27:35</a> and having said these things, and having taken bread, he  gave thanks to God before all, and having broken [it], he began  to eat;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:36">27:36</a> and all having become of good cheer, themselves also took  food,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:37">27:37</a> (and we were -- all the souls in the ship -- two hundred,  seventy and six),</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:38">27:38</a> and having eaten sufficient nourishment, they were  lightening the ship, casting forth the wheat into the sea.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:39">27:39</a> And when the day came, they were not discerning the land,  but a certain creek were perceiving having a beach, into which  they took counsel, if possible, to thrust forward the ship,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:40">27:40</a> and the anchors having taken up, they were committing [it]  to the sea, at the same time -- having loosed the bands of the  rudders, and having hoisted up the mainsail to the wind -- they  were making for the shore,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:41">27:41</a> and having fallen into a place of two seas, they ran the  ship aground, and the fore-part, indeed, having stuck fast,  did remain immoveable, but the hinder-part was broken by the  violence of the waves.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:42">27:42</a> And the soldiers' counsel was that they should kill the  prisoners, lest any one having swam out should escape,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:43">27:43</a> but the centurion, wishing to save Paul, hindered them  from the counsel, and did command those able to swim, having  cast themselves out first -- to get unto the land,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:44">27:44</a> and the rest, some indeed upon boards, and some upon  certain things of the ship; and thus it came to pass that all  came safe unto the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:1">28:1</a> And having been saved, then they knew that the island is  called Melita,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:2">28:2</a> and the foreigners were shewing us no ordinary kindness,  for having kindled a fire, they received us all, because of the  pressing rain, and because of the cold;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:3">28:3</a> but Paul having gathered together a quantity of sticks, and  having laid [them] upon the fire, a viper -- out of the heat  having come -- did fasten on his hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:4">28:4</a> And when the foreigners saw the beast hanging from his  hand, they said unto one another, `Certainly this man is a  murderer, whom, having been saved out of the sea, the justice  did not suffer to live;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:5">28:5</a> he then, indeed, having shaken off the beast into the fire,  suffered no evil,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:6">28:6</a> and they were expecting him to be about to be inflamed, or  to fall down suddenly dead, and they, expecting [it] a long  time, and seeing nothing uncommon happening to him, changing  [their] minds, said he was a god.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:7">28:7</a> And in the neighbourhood of that place were lands of the  principal man of the island, by name Publius, who, having  received us, three days did courteously lodge [us];</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:8">28:8</a> and it came to pass, the father of Publius with feverish  heats and dysentery pressed, was laid, unto whom Paul having  entered, and having prayed, having laid [his] hands on him,  healed him;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:9">28:9</a> this, therefore, being done, the others also in the island  having infirmities were coming and were healed;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:10">28:10</a> who also with many honours did honour us, and we setting  sail -- they were lading [us] with the things that were  necessary.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:11">28:11</a> And after three months, we set sail in a ship (that had  wintered in the isle) of Alexandria, with the sign Dioscuri,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:12">28:12</a> and having landed at Syracuse, we remained three days,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:13">28:13</a> thence having gone round, we came to Rhegium, and after  one day, a south wind having sprung up, the second [day] we  came to Puteoli;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:14">28:14</a> where, having found brethren, we were called upon to  remain with them seven days, and thus to Rome we came;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:15">28:15</a> and thence, the brethren having heard the things  concerning us, came forth to meet us, unto Appii Forum, and  Three Taverns -- whom Paul having seen, having given thanks to  God, took courage.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:16">28:16</a> And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered up the  prisoners to the captain of the barrack, but Paul was suffered  to remain by himself, with the soldier guarding him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:17">28:17</a> And it came to pass after three days, Paul called together  those who are the principal men of the Jews, and they having  come together, he said unto them: `Men, brethren, I -- having  done nothing contrary to the people, or to the customs of the  fathers -- a prisoner from Jerusalem, was delivered up to the  hands of the Romans;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:18">28:18</a> who, having examined me, were wishing to release [me],  because of their being no cause of death in me,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:19">28:19</a> and the Jews having spoken against [it], I was constrained  to appeal unto Caesar -- not as having anything to accuse my  nation of;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:20">28:20</a> for this cause, therefore, I called for you to see and to  speak with [you], for because of the hope of Israel with this  chain I am bound.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:21">28:21</a> And they said unto him, `We did neither receive letters  concerning thee from Judea, nor did any one who came of the  brethren declare or speak any evil concerning thee,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:22">28:22</a> and we think it good from thee to hear what thou dost  think, for, indeed, concerning this sect it is known to us that  everywhere it is spoken against;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:23">28:23</a> and having appointed him a day, they came, more of them  unto him, to the lodging, to whom he was expounding, testifying  fully the reign of God, persuading them also of the things  concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses, and the prophets,  from morning till evening,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:24">28:24</a> and, some, indeed, were believing the things spoken, and  some were not believing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:25">28:25</a> And not being agreed with one another, they were going  away, Paul having spoken one word -- `Well did the Holy Spirit  speak through Isaiah the prophet unto our fathers,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:26">28:26</a> saying, Go on unto this people and say, With hearing ye  shall hear, and ye shall not understand, and seeing ye shall  see, and ye shall not perceive,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:27">28:27</a> for made gross was the heart of this people, and with the  ears they heard heavily, and their eyes they did close, lest  they may see with the eyes, and with the heart may understand,  and be turned back, and I may heal them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:28">28:28</a> `Be it known, therefore, to you, that to the nations was  sent the salvation of God, these also will hear it;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:29">28:29</a> and he having said these things, the Jews went away,  having much disputation among themselves;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:30">28:30</a> and Paul remained an entire two years in his own hired  [house], and was receiving all those coming in unto him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:31">28:31</a> preaching the reign of God, and teaching the things  concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness --  unforbidden. </p>
