 <h3 align="CENTER">Apocrypha: Wisdom Chapter 3</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> But the souls of the righteous are in the hand of God, and there shall no torment touch them. </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> In the sight of the unwise they seemed to die: and their departure is taken for misery, </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And their going from us to be utter destruction: but they are in peace. </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> For though they be punished in the sight of men, yet is their hope full of immortality. </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And having been a little chastised, they shall be greatly rewarded: for God proved them, and found them worthy for himself. </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> As gold in the furnace hath he tried them, and received them as a burnt offering. </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And in the time of their visitation they shall shine, and run to and fro like sparks among the stubble. </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> They shall judge the nations, and have dominion over the people, and their Lord shall reign for ever. </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> They that put their trust in him shall understand the truth: and such as be faithful in love shall abide with him: for grace and mercy is to his saints, and he hath care for his elect. </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> But the ungodly shall be punished according to their own imaginations, which have neglected the righteous, and forsaken the Lord. </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> For whoso despiseth wisdom and nurture, he is miserable, and their hope is vain, their labours unfruitful, and their works unprofitable: </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Their wives are foolish, and their children wicked: </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Their offspring is cursed. Wherefore blessed is the barren that is undefiled, which hath not known the sinful bed: she shall have fruit in the visitation of souls. </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And blessed is the eunuch, which with his hands hath wrought no iniquity, nor imagined wicked things against God: for unto him shall be given the special gift of faith, and an inheritance in the temple of the Lord more acceptable to his mind. </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> For glorious is the fruit of good labours: and the root of wisdom shall never fall away. </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> As for the children of adulterers, they shall not come to their perfection, and the seed of an unrighteous bed shall be rooted out. </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> For though they live long, yet shall they be nothing regarded: and their last age shall be without honour. </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Or, if they die quickly, they have no hope, neither comfort in the day of trial. </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> For horrible is the end of the unrighteous generation. </p>
