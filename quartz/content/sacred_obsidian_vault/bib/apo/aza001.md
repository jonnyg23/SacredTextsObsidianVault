 <h3 align="CENTER">Apocrypha: Prayer of Azariah Chapter 1</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And they walked in the midst of the fire, praising God, and blessing the Lord. </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Then Azarias stood up, and prayed on this manner; and opening his mouth in the midst of the fire said, </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Blessed art thou, O Lord God of our fathers: thy name is worthy to be praised and glorified for evermore: </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> For thou art righteous in all the things that thou hast done to us: yea, true are all thy works, thy ways are right, and all thy judgments truth. </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> In all the things that thou hast brought upon us, and upon the holy city of our fathers, even Jerusalem, thou hast executed true judgment: for according to truth and judgment didst thou bring all these things upon us because of our sins. </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> For we have sinned and committed iniquity, departing from thee. </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> In all things have we trespassed, and not obeyed thy commandments, nor kept them, neither done as thou hast commanded us, that it might go well with us. </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Wherefore all that thou hast brought upon us, and every thing that thou hast done to us, thou hast done in true judgment. </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And thou didst deliver us into the hands of lawless enemies, most hateful forsakers of God, and to an unjust king, and the most wicked in all the world. </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And now we cannot open our mouths, we are become a shame and reproach to thy servants; and to them that worship thee. </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Yet deliver us not up wholly, for thy name's sake, neither disannul thou thy covenant: </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And cause not thy mercy to depart from us, for thy beloved Abraham's sake, for thy servant Issac's sake, and for thy holy Israel's sake; </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> To whom thou hast spoken and promised, that thou wouldest multiply their seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that lieth upon the seashore. </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> For we, O Lord, are become less than any nation, and be kept under this day in all the world because of our sins. </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Neither is there at this time prince, or prophet, or leader, or burnt offering, or sacrifice, or oblation, or incense, or place to sacrifice before thee, and to find mercy. </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Nevertheless in a contrite heart and an humble spirit let us be accepted. </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Like as in the burnt offerings of rams and bullocks, and like as in ten thousands of fat lambs: so let our sacrifice be in thy sight this day, and grant that we may wholly go after thee: for they shall not be confounded that put their trust in thee. </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And now we follow thee with all our heart, we fear thee, and seek thy face. </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Put us not to shame: but deal with us after thy lovingkindness, and according to the multitude of thy mercies. </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Deliver us also according to thy marvellous works, and give glory to thy name, O Lord: and let all them that do thy servants hurt be ashamed; </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And let them be confounded in all their power and might, and let their strength be broken; </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And let them know that thou art God, the only God, and glorious over the whole world. </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And the king's servants, that put them in, ceased not to make the oven hot with rosin, pitch, tow, and small wood; </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> So that the flame streamed forth above the furnace forty and nine cubits. </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And it passed through, and burned those Chaldeans it found about the furnace. </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> But the angel of the Lord came down into the oven together with Azarias and his fellows, and smote the flame of the fire out of the oven; </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And made the midst of the furnace as it had been a moist whistling wind, so that the fire touched them not at all, neither hurt nor troubled them. </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Then the three, as out of one mouth, praised, glorified, and blessed, God in the furnace, saying, </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Blessed art thou, O Lord God of our fathers: and to be praised and exalted above all for ever. </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And blessed is thy glorious and holy name: and to be praised and exalted above all for ever. </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Blessed art thou in the temple of thine holy glory: and to be praised and glorified above all for ever. </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> Blessed art thou that beholdest the depths, and sittest upon the cherubims: and to be praised and exalted above all for ever. </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Blessed art thou on the glorious throne of thy kingdom: and to be praised and glorified above all for ever. </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> Blessed art thou in the firmament of heaven: and above ail to be praised and glorified for ever. </p>
