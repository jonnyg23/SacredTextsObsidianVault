 <h3 align="CENTER">Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 5</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Set thy heart upon thy goods; and say not, I have enough for my life. </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Follow not thine own mind and thy strength, to walk in the ways of thy heart: </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And say not, Who shall controul me for my works? for the Lord will surely revenge thy pride. </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Say not, I have sinned, and what harm hath happened unto me? for the Lord is longsuffering, he will in no wise let thee go. </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Concerning propitiation, be not without fear to add sin unto sin: </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And say not His mercy is great; he will be pacified for the multitude of my sins: for mercy and wrath come from him, and his indignation resteth upon sinners. </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Make no tarrying to turn to the Lord, and put not off from day to day: for suddenly shall the wrath of the Lord come forth, and in thy security thou shalt be destroyed, and perish in the day of vengeance. </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Set not thine heart upon goods unjustly gotten, for they shall not profit thee in the day of calamity. </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Winnow not with every wind, and go not into every way: for so doth the sinner that hath a double tongue. </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Be stedfast in thy understanding; and let thy word be the same. </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Be swift to hear; and let thy life be sincere; and with patience give answer. </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> If thou hast understanding, answer thy neighbour; if not, lay thy hand upon thy mouth. </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Honour and shame is in talk: and the tongue of man is his fall. </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Be not called a whisperer, and lie not in wait with thy tongue: for a foul shame is upon the thief, and an evil condemnation upon the double tongue. </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Be not ignorant of any thing in a great matter or a small. </p>
