 <h3 align="CENTER">Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 31</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Watching for riches consumeth the flesh, and the care thereof driveth away sleep. </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Watching care will not let a man slumber, as a sore disease breaketh sleep, </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> The rich hath great labour in gathering riches together; and when he resteth, he is filled with his delicates. </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> The poor laboureth in his poor estate; and when he leaveth off, he is still needy. </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> He that loveth gold shall not be justified, and he that followeth corruption shall have enough thereof. </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Gold hath been the ruin of many, and their destruction was present. </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> It is a stumblingblock unto them that sacrifice unto it, and every fool shall be taken therewith. </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Blessed is the rich that is found without blemish, and hath not gone after gold. </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Who is he? and we will call him blessed: for wonderful things hath he done among his people. </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Who hath been tried thereby, and found perfect? then let him glory. Who might offend, and hath not offended? or done evil, and hath not done it? </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> His goods shall be established, and the congregation shall declare his alms. </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> If thou sit at a bountiful table, be not greedy upon it, and say not, There is much meat on it. </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Remember that a wicked eye is an evil thing: and what is created more wicked than an eye? therefore it weepeth upon every occasion. </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Stretch not thine hand whithersoever it looketh, and thrust it not with him into the dish. </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Judge not thy neighbour by thyself: and be discreet in every point. </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Eat as it becometh a man, those things which are set before thee; and devour note, lest thou be hated. </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Leave off first for manners' sake; and be not unsatiable, lest thou offend. </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> When thou sittest among many, reach not thine hand out first of all. </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> A very little is sufficient for a man well nurtured, and he fetcheth not his wind short upon his bed. </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Sound sleep cometh of moderate eating: he riseth early, and his wits are with him: but the pain of watching, and choler, and pangs of the belly, are with an unsatiable man. </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And if thou hast been forced to eat, arise, go forth, vomit, and thou shalt have rest. </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> My son, hear me, and despise me not, and at the last thou shalt find as I told thee: in all thy works be quick, so shall there no sickness come unto thee. </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Whoso is liberal of his meat, men shall speak well of him; and the report of his good housekeeping will be believed. </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> But against him that is a niggard of his meat the whole city shall murmur; and the testimonies of his niggardness shall not be doubted of. </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Shew not thy valiantness in wine; for wine hath destroyed many. </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> The furnace proveth the edge by dipping: so doth wine the hearts of the proud by drunkeness. </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Wine is as good as life to a man, if it be drunk moderately: what life is then to a man that is without wine? for it was made to make men glad. </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Wine measurably drunk and in season bringeth gladness of the heart, and cheerfulness of the mind: </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> But wine drunken with excess maketh bitterness of the mind, with brawling and quarrelling. </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Drunkenness increaseth the rage of a fool till he offend: it diminisheth strength, and maketh wounds. </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Rebuke not thy neighbour at the wine, and despise him not in his mirth: give him no despiteful words, and press not upon him with urging him [to drink.] </p>
