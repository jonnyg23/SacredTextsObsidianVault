 <h3 align="CENTER">Apocrypha: Wisdom Chapter 1</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Love righteousness, ye that be judges of the earth: think of the Lord with a good (heart,) and in simplicity of heart seek him. </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> For he will be found of them that tempt him not; and sheweth himself unto such as do not distrust him. </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> For froward thoughts separate from God: and his power, when it is tried, reproveth the unwise. </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> For into a malicious soul wisdom shall not enter; nor dwell in the body that is subject unto sin. </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> For the holy spirit of discipline will flee deceit, and remove from thoughts that are without understanding, and will not abide when unrighteousness cometh in. </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> For wisdom is a loving spirit; and will not acquit a blasphemer of his words: for God is witness of his reins, and a true beholder of his heart, and a hearer of his tongue. </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> For the Spirit of the Lord filleth the world: and that which containeth all things hath knowledge of the voice. </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Therefore he that speaketh unrighteous things cannot be hid: neither shall vengeance, when it punisheth, pass by him. </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> For inquisition shall be made into the counsels of the ungodly: and the sound of his words shall come unto the Lord for the manifestation of his wicked deeds. </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> For the ear of jealousy heareth all things: and the noise of murmurings is not hid. </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Therefore beware of murmuring, which is unprofitable; and refrain your tongue from backbiting: for there is no word so secret, that shall go for nought: and the mouth that belieth slayeth the soul. </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Seek not death in the error of your life: and pull not upon yourselves destruction with the works of your hands. </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> For God made not death: neither hath he pleasure in the destruction of the living. </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> For he created all things, that they might have their being: and the generations of the world were healthful; and there is no poison of destruction in them, nor the kingdom of death upon the earth: </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> (For righteousness is immortal:) </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> But ungodly men with their works and words called it to them: for when they thought to have it their friend, they consumed to nought, and made a covenant with it, because they are worthy to take part with it. </p>
