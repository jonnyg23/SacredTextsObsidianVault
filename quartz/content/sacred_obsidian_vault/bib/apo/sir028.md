 <h3 align="CENTER">Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 28</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> He that revengeth shall find vengeance from the Lord, and he will surely keep his sins [in remembrance.] </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Forgive thy neighbour the hurt that he hath done unto thee, so shall thy sins also be forgiven when thou prayest. </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> One man beareth hatred against another, and doth he seek pardon from the Lord? </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> He sheweth no mercy to a man, which is like himself: and doth he ask forgiveness of his own sins? </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> If he that is but flesh nourish hatred, who will intreat for pardon of his sins? </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Remember thy end, and let enmity cease; [remember] corruption and death, and abide in the commandments. </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Remember the commandments, and bear no malice to thy neighbour: [remember] the covenant of the Highest, and wink at ignorance. </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Abstain from strife, and thou shalt diminish thy sins: for a furious man will kindle strife, </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> A sinful man disquieteth friends, and maketh debate among them that be at peace. </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> As the matter of the fire is, so it burneth: and as a man's strength is, so is his wrath; and according to his riches his anger riseth; and the stronger they are which contend, the more they will be inflamed. </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> An hasty contention kindleth a fire: and an hasty fighting sheddeth blood. </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> If thou blow the spark, it shall burn: if thou spit upon it, it shall be quenched: and both these come out of thy mouth. </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Curse the whisperer and doubletongued: for such have destroyed many that were at peace. </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> A backbiting tongue hath disquieted many, and driven them from nation to nation: strong cities hath it pulled down, and overthrown the houses of great men. </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> A backbiting tongue hath cast out virtuous women, and deprived them of their labours. </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Whoso hearkeneth unto it shall never find rest, and never dwell quietly. </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> The stroke of the whip maketh marks in the flesh: but the stroke of the tongue breaketh the bones. </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Many have fallen by the edge of the sword: but not so many as have fallen by the tongue. </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Well is he that is defended through the venom thereof; who hath not drawn the yoke thereof, nor hath been bound in her bands. </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> For the yoke thereof is a yoke of iron, and the bands thereof are bands of brass. </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> The death thereof is an evil death, the grave were better than it. </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> It shall not have rule over them that fear God, neither shall they be burned with the flame thereof. </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Such as forsake the Lord shall fall into it; and it shall burn in them, and not be quenched; it shall be sent upon them as a lion, and devour them as a leopard. </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Look that thou hedge thy possession about with thorns, and bind up thy silver and gold, </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And weigh thy words in a balance, and make a door and bar for thy mouth. </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Beware thou slide not by it, lest thou fall before him that lieth in wait. </p>
