 <h3 align="CENTER">Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 34</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> The hopes of a man void of understanding are vain and false: and dreams lift up fools. </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Whoso regardeth dreams is like him that catcheth at a shadow, and followeth after the wind. </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> The vision of dreams is the resemblance of one thing to another, even as the likeness of a face to a face. </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Of an unclean thing what can be cleansed? and from that thing which is false what truth can come? </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Divinations, and soothsayings, and dreams, are vain: and the heart fancieth, as a woman's heart in travail. </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> If they be not sent from the most High in thy visitation, set not thy heart upon them. </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> For dreams have deceived many, and they have failed that put their trust in them. </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> The law shall be found perfect without lies: and wisdom is perfection to a faithful mouth. </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> A man that hath travelled knoweth many things; and he that hath much experience will declare wisdom. </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> He that hath no experience knoweth little: but he that hath travelled is full of prudence. </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> When I travelled, I saw many things; and I understand more than I can express. </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> I was ofttimes in danger of death: yet I was delivered because of these things. </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> The spirit of those that fear the Lord shall live; for their hope is in him that saveth them. </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Whoso feareth the Lord shall not fear nor be afraid; for he is his hope. </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Blessed is the soul of him that feareth the Lord: to whom doth he look? and who is his strength? </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> For the eyes of the Lord are upon them that love him, he is their mighty protection and strong stay, a defence from heat, and a cover from the sun at noon, a preservation from stumbling, and an help from falling. </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> He raiseth up the soul, and lighteneth the eyes: he giveth health, life, and blessing. </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> He that sacrificeth of a thing wrongfully gotten, his offering is ridiculous; and the gifts of unjust men are not accepted. </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> The most High is not pleased with the offerings of the wicked; neither is he pacified for sin by the multitude of sacrifices. </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Whoso bringeth an offering of the goods of the poor doeth as one that killeth the son before his father's eyes. </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> The bread of the needy is their life: he that defraudeth him thereof is a man of blood. </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> He that taketh away his neighbour's living slayeth him; and he that defraudeth the labourer of his hire is a bloodshedder. </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> When one buildeth, and another pulleth down, what profit have they then but labour? </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> When one prayeth, and another curseth, whose voice will the Lord hear? </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> He that washeth himself after the touching of a dead body, if he touch it again, what availeth his washing? </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> So is it with a man that fasteth for his sins, and goeth again, and doeth the same: who will hear his prayer? or what doth his humbling profit him? </p>
