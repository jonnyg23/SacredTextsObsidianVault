 <h3 align="CENTER">Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 7</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Do no evil, so shall no harm come unto thee. </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Depart from the unjust, and iniquity shall turn away from thee. </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> My son, sow not upon the furrows of unrighteousness, and thou shalt not reap them sevenfold. </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Seek not of the Lord preeminence, neither of the king the seat of honour. </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> justify not thyself before the Lord; and boast not of thy wisdom before the king. </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Seek not to be judge, being not able to take away iniquity; lest at any time thou fear the person of the mighty, an stumblingblock in the way of thy uprightness. </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Offend not against the multitude of a city, and then thou shalt not cast thyself down among the people. </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Bind not one sin upon another; for in one thou shalt not be unpunished. </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Say not, God will look upon the multitude of my oblations, and when I offer to the most high God, he will accept it. </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Be not fainthearted when thou makest thy prayer, and neglect not to give alms. </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Laugh no man to scorn in the bitterness of his soul: for there is one which humbleth and exalteth. </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Devise not a lie against thy brother; neither do the like to thy friend. </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Use not to make any manner of lie: for the custom thereof is not good. </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Use not many words in a multitude of elders, and make not much babbling when thou prayest. </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Hate not laborious work, neither husbandry, which the most High hath ordained. </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Number not thyself among the multitude of sinners, but remember that wrath will not tarry long. </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Humble thyself greatly: for the vengeance of the ungodly is fire and worms. </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Change not a friend for any good by no means; neither a faithful brother for the gold of Ophir. </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Forego not a wise and good woman: for her grace is above gold. </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Whereas thy servant worketh truly, entreat him not evil. nor the hireling that bestoweth himself wholly for thee. </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Let thy soul love a good servant, and defraud him not of liberty. </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Hast thou cattle? have an eye to them: and if they be for thy profit, keep them with thee. </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Hast thou children? instruct them, and bow down their neck from their youth. </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Hast thou daughters? have a care of their body, and shew not thyself cheerful toward them. </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Marry thy daughter, and so shalt thou have performed a weighty matter: but give her to a man of understanding. </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Hast thou a wife after thy mind? forsake her not: but give not thyself over to a light woman. </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Honour thy father with thy whole heart, and forget not the sorrows of thy mother. </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Remember that thou wast begotten of them; and how canst thou recompense them the things that they have done for thee? </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Fear the Lord with all thy soul, and reverence his priests. </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Love him that made thee with all thy strength, and forsake not his ministers. </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Fear the Lord, and honor the priest; and give him his portion, as it is commanded thee; the firstfruits, and the trespass offering, and the gift of the shoulders, and the sacrifice of sanctification, and the firstfruits of the holy things. </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And stretch thine hand unto the poor, that thy blessing may be perfected. </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> A gift hath grace in the sight of every man living; and for the dead detain it not. </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> Fail not to be with them that weep, and mourn with them that mourn. </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> Be not slow to visit the sick: for that shall make thee to be beloved. </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> Whatsoever thou takest in hand, remember the end, and thou shalt never do amiss. </p>
