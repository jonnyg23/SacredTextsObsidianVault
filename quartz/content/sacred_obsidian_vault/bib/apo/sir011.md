 <h3 align="CENTER">Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 11</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Wisdom lifteth up the head of him that is of low degree, and maketh him to sit among great men. </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Commend not a man for his beauty; neither abhor a man for his outward appearance. </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> The bee is little among such as fly; but her fruit is the chief of sweet things. </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Boast not of thy clothing and raiment, and exalt not thyself in the day of honour: for the works of the Lord are wonderful, and his works among men are hidden. </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Many kings have sat down upon the ground; and one that was never thought of hath worn the crown. </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Many mighty men have been greatly disgraced; and the honourable delivered into other men's hands. </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Blame not before thou hast examined the truth: understand first, and then rebuke. </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Answer not before thou hast heard the cause: neither interrupt men in the midst of their talk. </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Strive not in a matter that concerneth thee not; and sit not in judgment with sinners. </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> My son, meddle not with many matters: for if thou meddle much, thou shalt not be innocent; and if thou follow after, thou shalt not obtain, neither shalt thou escape by fleeing. </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> There is one that laboureth, and taketh pains, and maketh haste, and is so much the more behind. </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Again, there is another that is slow, and hath need of help, wanting ability, and full of poverty; yet the eye of the Lord looked upon him for good, and set him up from his low estate, </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And lifted up his head from misery; so that many that saw from him is peace over all the </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Prosperity and adversity, life and death, poverty and riches, come of the Lord. </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Wisdom, knowledge, and understanding of the law, are of the Lord: love, and the way of good works, are from him. </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Error and darkness had their beginning together with sinners: and evil shall wax old with them that glory therein. </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> The gift of the Lord remaineth with the ungodly, and his favour bringeth prosperity for ever. </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> There is that waxeth rich by his wariness and pinching, and this his the portion of his reward: </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Whereas he saith, I have found rest, and now will eat continually of my goods; and yet he knoweth not what time shall come upon him, and that he must leave those things to others, and die. </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Be stedfast in thy covenant, and be conversant therein, and wax old in thy work. </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Marvel not at the works of sinners; but trust in the Lord, and abide in thy labour: for it is an easy thing in the sight of the Lord on the sudden to make a poor man rich. </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> The blessing of the Lord is in the reward of the godly, and suddenly he maketh his blessing flourish. </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Say not, What profit is there of my service? and what good things shall I have hereafter? </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Again, say not, I have enough, and possess many things, and what evil shall I have hereafter? </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> In the day of prosperity there is a forgetfulness of affliction: and in the day of affliction there is no more remembrance of prosperity. </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> For it is an easy thing unto the Lord in the day of death to reward a man according to his ways. </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> The affliction of an hour maketh a man forget pleasure: and in his end his deeds shall be discovered. </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Judge none blessed before his death: for a man shall be known in his children. </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Bring not every man into thine house: for the deceitful man hath many trains. </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Like as a partridge taken [and kept] in a cage, so is the heart of the proud; and like as a spy, watcheth he for thy fall: </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> For he lieth in wait, and turneth good into evil, and in things worthy praise will lay blame upon thee. </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> Of a spark of fire a heap of coals is kindled: and a sinful man layeth wait for blood. </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Take heed of a mischievous man, for he worketh wickedness; lest he bring upon thee a perpetual blot. </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> Receive a stranger into thine house, and he will disturb thee, and turn thee out of thine own. </p>
