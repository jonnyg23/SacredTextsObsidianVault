 <p><a name="an_gen:12:1">1</a> Now the LORD said unto Abram: 'Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto the land that I will show thee. <a name="an_gen:12:2">2</a> And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and be thou a blessing. <a name="an_gen:12:3">3</a> And I will bless them that bless thee, and him that curseth thee will I curse; and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed.' <a name="an_gen:12:4">4</a> So Abram went, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him; and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran. <a name="an_gen:12:5">5</a> And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came. <a name="an_gen:12:6">6</a> And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the terebinth of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land. <a name="an_gen:12:7">7</a> And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said: 'Unto thy seed will I give this land'; and he builded there an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him. <a name="an_gen:12:8">8</a> And he removed from thence unto the mountain on the east of Beth-el, and pitched his tent, having Beth-el on the west, and Ai on the east; and he builded there an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD. <a name="an_gen:12:9">9</a> And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the South.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_gen:12:10">10</a> And there was a famine in the land; and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was sore in the land. <a name="an_gen:12:11">11</a> And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife: 'Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon. <a name="an_gen:12:12">12</a> And it will come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they will say: This is his wife; and they will kill me, but thee they will keep alive. <a name="an_gen:12:13">13</a> Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister; that it may be well with me for thy sake, and that my soul may live because of thee.' <a name="an_gen:12:14">14</a> And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair. <a name="an_gen:12:15">15</a> And the princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh; and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house. <a name="an_gen:12:16">16</a> And he dealt well with Abram for her sake; and he had sheep, and oxen, and he-asses, and menservants, and maid-servants, and she-asses, and camels. <a name="an_gen:12:17">17</a> And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife. <a name="an_gen:12:18">18</a> And Pharaoh called Abram, and said: 'What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife? <a name="an_gen:12:19">19</a> Why saidst thou: She is my sister? so that I took her to be my wife; now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.' <a name="an_gen:12:20">20</a> And Pharaoh gave men charge concerning him; and they brought him on the way, and his wife, and all that he had.</p>
