 <p><a name="an_sa2:9:1">1</a>  And David said: `Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness for Jonathan's sake?' <a name="an_sa2:9:2">2</a>  Now there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba, and they called him unto David; and the king said unto him: `Art thou Ziba?' And he said: `Thy servant is he.' <a name="an_sa2:9:3">3</a>  And the king said: `Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may show the kindness of God unto him?' And Ziba said unto the king: `Jonathan hath yet a son, who is lame on his feet.' <a name="an_sa2:9:4">4</a>  And the king said unto him: `Where is he?' And Ziba said unto the king: `Behold, he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, in Lodebar.'</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> <a name="an_sa2:9:5">5</a>  Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lo-debar. <a name="an_sa2:9:6">6</a>  And Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came unto David, and fell on his face, and prostrated himself. And David said: `Mephibosheth!' And he answered: `Behold thy servant!' <a name="an_sa2:9:7">7</a>  And David said unto him: `Fear not; for I will surely show thee kindness for Jonathan thy father's sake, and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually.' <a name="an_sa2:9:8">8</a>  And he bowed down, and said: `What is thy servant, that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?'</p>  
 <p><a name="an_sa2:9:9">9</a>  Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said unto him: `All that pertained to Saul and to all his house have I given unto thy master's son. <a name="an_sa2:9:10">10</a>  And thou shalt till the land for him, thou, and thy sons, and thy servants; and thou shalt bring in the fruits, that thy master's son may have bread to eat; but Mephibosheth thy master's son shall eat bread continually at my table.' Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants. <a name="an_sa2:9:11">11</a>  Then said Ziba unto the king: `According to all that my lord the king commandeth his servant, so shall thy servant do; but Mephibosheth eateth at my table as one of the king's sons.' <a name="an_sa2:9:12">12</a>  Now Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Mica. And all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto Mephibosheth. <a name="an_sa2:9:13">13</a>  But Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem; for he did eat continually at the king's table; and he was lame on both his feet.</p>
