 <p><a name="an_gen:35:1">1</a> And God said unto Jacob: 'Arise, go up to Beth-el, and dwell there; and make there an altar unto God, who appeared unto thee when thou didst flee from the face of Esau thy brother.' <a name="an_gen:35:2">2</a> Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him: 'Put away the strange gods that are among you, and purify yourselves, and change your garments; <a name="an_gen:35:3">3</a> and let us arise, and go up to Beth-el; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.' <a name="an_gen:35:4">4</a> And they gave unto Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hand, and the rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the terebinth which was by Shechem. <a name="an_gen:35:5">5</a> And they journeyed; and a terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob. <a name="an_gen:35:6">6</a> So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan—the same is Beth-el—he and all the people that were with him. <a name="an_gen:35:7">7</a> And he built there an altar, and called the place  <a name="fr_58"></a><a href="#fn_57"><font size="1">a</font></a>
 El-beth-el, because there God was revealed unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother. <a name="an_gen:35:8">8</a> And Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried below Beth-el under the oak; and the name of it was called  <a name="fr_59"></a><a href="#fn_58"><font size="1">b</font></a>
 Allon-bacuth.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_gen:35:9">9</a> And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him. <a name="an_gen:35:10">10</a> And God said unto him: 'Thy name is Jacob; thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name'; and He called his name Israel. <a name="an_gen:35:11">11</a> And God said unto him: 'I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins; <a name="an_gen:35:12">12</a> and the land which I gave unto Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.' <a name="an_gen:35:13">13</a> And God went up from him in the place where He spoke with him. <a name="an_gen:35:14">14</a> And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where He spoke with him, a pillar of stone, and he poured out a drink-offering thereon, and poured oil thereon. <a name="an_gen:35:15">15</a> And Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him, Beth-el. <a name="an_gen:35:16">16</a> And they journeyed from Beth-el; and there was still some way to come to Ephrath; and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour. <a name="an_gen:35:17">17</a> And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her: 'Fear not; for this also is a son for thee.' <a name="an_gen:35:18">18</a> And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing—for she died—that she called his name  <a name="fr_60"></a><a href="#fn_59"><font size="1">c</font></a>
 Ben-oni; but his father called him  <a name="fr_61"></a><a href="#fn_60"><font size="1">d</font></a>
 Benjamin. <a name="an_gen:35:19">19</a> And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath—the same is Bethlehem. <a name="an_gen:35:20">20</a> And Jacob set up a pillar upon her grave; the same is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day. <a name="an_gen:35:21">21</a> And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond Migdal-eder. <a name="an_gen:35:22">22</a> And it came to pass, while Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine; and Israel heard of it.</p>  
 <p>Now the sons of Jacob were twelve: <a name="an_gen:35:23">23</a> the sons of Leah: Reuben, <a name="page_44"><font size="1" color="green">p. 44</font></a> Jacob's first-born, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun; <a name="an_gen:35:24">24</a> the sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin; <a name="an_gen:35:25">25</a> and the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid: Dan and Naphtali; <a name="an_gen:35:26">26</a> and the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid: Gad and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob, that were born to him in Paddan-aram. <a name="an_gen:35:27">27</a> And Jacob came unto Isaac his father to Mamre, to Kiriath-arba—the same is Hebron—where Abraham and Isaac sojourned. <a name="an_gen:35:28">28</a> And the days of Isaac were a hundred and fourscore years. <a name="an_gen:35:29">29</a> And Isaac expired, and died, and was gathered unto his people, old and full of days; and Esau and Jacob his sons buried him.</p>
