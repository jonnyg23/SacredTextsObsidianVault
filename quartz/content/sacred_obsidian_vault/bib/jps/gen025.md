 <p><a name="an_gen:25:1">1</a> And Abraham took another wife, and her name was Keturah. <a name="an_gen:25:2">2</a> And she bore him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and <a name="page_29"><font size="1" color="green">p. 29</font></a> Ishbak, and Shuah. <a name="an_gen:25:3">3</a> And Jokshan begot Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim. <a name="an_gen:25:4">4</a> And the sons of Midian: Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah. <a name="an_gen:25:5">5</a> And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac. <a name="an_gen:25:6">6</a> But unto the sons of the concubines, that Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts; and he sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country. <a name="an_gen:25:7">7</a> And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, a hundred threescore and fifteen years. <a name="an_gen:25:8">8</a> And Abraham expired, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people. <a name="an_gen:25:9">9</a> And Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre; <a name="an_gen:25:10">10</a> the field which Abraham purchased of the children of Heth; there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife. <a name="an_gen:25:11">11</a> And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed Isaac his son; and Isaac dwelt by Beer-lahai-roi.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_gen:25:12">12</a> Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bore unto Abraham. <a name="an_gen:25:13">13</a> And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the first-born of Ishmael, Nebaioth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam, <a name="an_gen:25:14">14</a> and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa; <a name="an_gen:25:15">15</a> Hadad, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedem; <a name="an_gen:25:16">16</a> these are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages, and by their encampments; twelve princes according to their nations. <a name="an_gen:25:17">17</a> And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, a hundred and thirty and seven years; and he expired and died; and was gathered unto his people. <a name="an_gen:25:18">18</a> And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Asshur: over against all his brethren he did settle.</p>

 <p><a name="an_gen:25:19">19</a> And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begot Isaac. <a name="an_gen:25:20">20</a> And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean, of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Aramean, to be his wife. <a name="an_gen:25:21">21</a> And Isaac entreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren; and the LORD let Himself be entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived. <a name="an_gen:25:22">22</a> And the children struggled together within her; and she said: 'If it be so, wherefore do I live?' And she went to inquire of the LORD. <a name="an_gen:25:23">23</a> And the LORD said unto her:</p>  
 <p>Two nations are in thy womb,<br> And two peoples shall be separated from thy bowels;<br> And the one people shall be stronger than the other people;<br> And the elder shall serve the younger.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_gen:25:24">24</a> And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb. <a name="an_gen:25:25">25</a> And the first came forth ruddy, all over like a hairy mantle; and they called his name Esau. <a name="an_gen:25:26">26</a> And after that came forth his brother, and his hand had hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called  <a name="fr_28"></a><a href="#fn_27"><font size="1">a</font></a>
 Jacob. And Isaac was threescore years old when she bore them. <a name="an_gen:25:27">27</a> And the boys grew; and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents. <a name="an_gen:25:28">28</a> Now Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison; and Rebekah loved Jacob. <a name="an_gen:25:29">29</a> And Jacob <a name="page_30"><font size="1" color="green">p. 30</font></a> sod pottage; and Esau came in from the field, and he was faint. <a name="an_gen:25:30">30</a> And Esau said to Jacob: 'Let me swallow, I pray thee, some of this red, red pottage; for I am faint.' Therefore was his name called  <a name="fr_29"></a><a href="#fn_28"><font size="1">a</font></a>
 Edom. <a name="an_gen:25:31">31</a> And Jacob said: 'Sell me first thy birthright.' <a name="an_gen:25:32">32</a> And Esau said: 'Behold, I am at the point to die; and what profit shall the birthright do to me?' <a name="an_gen:25:33">33</a> And Jacob said: 'Swear to me first'; and he swore unto him; and he sold his birthright unto Jacob. <a name="an_gen:25:34">34</a> And Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way. So Esau despised his birthright.</p>
