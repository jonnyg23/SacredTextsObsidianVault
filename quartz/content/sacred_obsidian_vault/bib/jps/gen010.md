 <p><a name="an_gen:10:1">1</a> Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah: Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and unto them were sons born after the flood.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_gen:10:2">2</a> The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras. <a name="an_gen:10:3">3</a> And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah. <a name="an_gen:10:4">4</a> And the sons of Javan: Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. <a name="an_gen:10:5">5</a> Of these were the isles of the nations divided in their lands, every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_gen:10:6">6</a> And the sons of Ham: Cush, and Mizraim, and Put, and Canaan. <a name="an_gen:10:7">7</a> And the sons of Cush: Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabteca; and the sons of Raamah: Sheba, and Dedan. <a name="an_gen:10:8">8</a> And Cush begot Nimrod; he began to be a mighty one in the earth. <a name="an_gen:10:9">9</a> He was a mighty hunter before the LORD; wherefore it is said: 'Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before the LORD.' <a name="an_gen:10:10">10</a> And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. <a name="an_gen:10:11">11</a> Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and Rehoboth-ir, and Calah, <a name="an_gen:10:12">12</a> and Resen between Nineveh and Calah—the same is the great city. <a name="an_gen:10:13">13</a> And Mizraim begot Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim, <a name="an_gen:10:14">14</a> and Pathrusim, and Casluhim—whence went forth the Philistines—and Caphtorim.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_gen:10:15">15</a> And Canaan begot Zidon his firstborn, and Heth; <a name="an_gen:10:16">16</a> and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgashite; <a name="an_gen:10:17">17</a> and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite; <a name="an_gen:10:18">18</a> and the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite; and afterward were the families of the Canaanite spread abroad. <a name="an_gen:10:19">19</a> And the border of the Canaanite was from Zidon, as thou goest toward Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest toward Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim, unto Lasha. <a name="an_gen:10:20">20</a> These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, in their nations.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_gen:10:21">21</a> And unto Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth, to him also were children born. <a name="an_gen:10:22">22</a> The sons of Shem: Elam, and Asshur, and Arpachshad, and Lud, and Aram. <a name="an_gen:10:23">23</a> And the sons of Aram: Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash. <a name="an_gen:10:24">24</a> And Arpachshad begot Shelah; and Shelah begot Eber. <a name="an_gen:10:25">25</a> And unto Eber were born two sons; the name of the one was  <a name="fr_16"></a><a href="#fn_15"><font size="1">b</font></a>
 Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan. <a name="an_gen:10:26">26</a> And Joktan begot Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah; <a name="an_gen:10:27">27</a> and Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah; <a name="an_gen:10:28">28</a> and Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba; <a name="an_gen:10:29">29</a> and Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab; all these were the sons of Joktan. <a name="an_gen:10:30">30</a> And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest toward Sephar, unto the mountain of the east. <a name="an_gen:10:31">31</a> These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations. <a name="page_13"><font size="1" color="green">p. 13</font></a></p>  
 <p><a name="an_gen:10:32">32</a> These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations; and of these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.</p>
