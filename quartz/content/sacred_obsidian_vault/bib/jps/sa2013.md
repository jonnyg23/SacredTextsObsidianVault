 <p><a name="an_sa2:13:1">1</a>  And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her. <a name="an_sa2:13:2">2</a>  And Amnon was so distressed that he fell sick because of his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and it seemed hard to Amnon to do any thing unto her. <a name="an_sa2:13:3">3</a>  But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother; and Jonadab was a very subtle man. <a name="an_sa2:13:4">4</a>  And he said unto him: `Why, O son of the king, art thou thus becoming leaner from day to day? wilt thou not tell me?' And Amnon said unto him: `I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.' <a name="an_sa2:13:5">5</a>  And Jonadab said unto him: `Lay thee down on thy bed, and feign thyself sick; and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him: Let my sister Tamar come, I pray thee, and give me bread to eat, and dress the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand.' <a name="an_sa2:13:6">6</a>  So Amnon lay down, and feigned himself sick; and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king: `Let my sister Tamar come, I pray thee, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand.'</p>  
 <p><a name="an_sa2:13:7">7</a>  Then David sent home to Tamar, saying: `Go now to thy brother Amnon's house, and dress him food.' <a name="an_sa2:13:8">8</a>  So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was lying down. And she took dough, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes. <a name="an_sa2:13:9">9</a>  And she took the pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said: `Have out all men from me.' And they went out every man from him. <a name="an_sa2:13:10">10</a>  And Amnon said unto Tamar: `Bring the food into the chamber, that I may eat of thy hand.' And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother. <a name="an_sa2:13:11">11</a>  And when she had brought them near unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her: `Come lie with me, my sister.' <a name="an_sa2:13:12">12</a>  And she answered him: `Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel; do not thou this wanton deed. <a name="an_sa2:13:13">13</a>  And I, whither shall I carry my shame? and as for thee, thou wilt be as one of the base men in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.'</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> <a name="an_sa2:13:14">14</a>  Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice; but being stronger than she, he forced her, and lay with her.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_sa2:13:15">15</a>  Then Amnon hated her with exceeding great hatred; for the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her: `Arise, be gone.' <a name="an_sa2:13:16">16</a>  And she said unto him: `Not so, because this great wrong in putting me forth is worse than the other that thou didst unto me.' But he would not hearken unto her. <a name="an_sa2:13:17">17</a>  Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said: `Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.'— <a name="an_sa2:13:18">18</a>  Now she had a garment of many colours upon her; for with such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins apparelled.—And his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her. <a name="an_sa2:13:19">19</a>  And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of many colours that was on her; and she laid her hand on her head, and went her way, crying aloud as she went.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_sa2:13:20">20</a>  And Absalom her brother said unto her: `Hath  <a name="fr_133"></a><a href="#fn_130"><font size="1">a</font></a>
 Amnon thy brother been with thee? but now hold thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother; take not this thing to heart.' So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house. <a name="an_sa2:13:21">21</a>  But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth. <a name="an_sa2:13:22">22</a>  And Absalom spoke unto Amnon neither good nor bad; for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_sa2:13:23">23</a>  And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal-hazor, which is beside Ephraim; and Absalom invited all the king's sons. <a name="an_sa2:13:24">24</a>  And Absalom came to the king, and said: `Behold now, thy servant hath sheep-shearers; let the king, I pray thee, and his servants go with thy servant.' <a name="an_sa2:13:25">25</a>  And the king said to Absalom: `Nay, my son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome unto thee.' And he pressed him; howbeit he would not go, but blessed him. <a name="an_sa2:13:26">26</a>  Then said Absalom: `If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us.' And the king said unto him: `Why should he go with thee?' <a name="an_sa2:13:27">27</a>  But Absalom pressed him, and he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him. <a name="an_sa2:13:28">28</a>  And Absalom commanded his servants, saying: `Mark ye now, when Anmon's heart is merry with wine; and when I say unto you: Smite Amnon, then kill him, fear not; have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.' <a name="an_sa2:13:29">29</a>  And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man got him up upon his mule, and fled.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_sa2:13:30">30</a>  And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that the tidings came to David, saying: `Absalom hath slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left.' <a name="an_sa2:13:31">31</a>  Then the king arose, and rent his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent. <a name="an_sa2:13:32">32</a>  And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and said: `Let not my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead; for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar. <a name="an_sa2:13:33">33</a>  Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead; for Amnon only is dead.'</p>  
 <p><a name="an_sa2:13:34">34</a>  But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people in a round-about</p>  
 <p><a name="page_382"><font size="1" color="green">p. 382</font></a></p>  
 <p>way by the hill-side. <a name="an_sa2:13:35">35</a>  And Jonadab said unto the king: `Behold, the king's sons are come; as thy servant said, so it is.' <a name="an_sa2:13:36">36</a>  And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice, and wept; and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_sa2:13:37">37</a>  But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And [David] mourned for his son every day.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_sa2:13:38">38</a>  So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years. <a name="an_sa2:13:39">39</a>  And the soul of king David failed with longing for Absalom; for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.</p>
