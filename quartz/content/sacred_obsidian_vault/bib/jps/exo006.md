 <p><a name="an_exo:6:1">1</a> And the LORD said unto Moses: 'Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh; for by a strong hand shall he let them go, and by a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land.'</p>  
 <p align="center">‏וארא‎</p>  
 <p><a name="an_exo:6:2">2</a> And God spoke unto Moses, and said unto him: 'I am the LORD; <a name="an_exo:6:3">3</a> and I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, as God Almighty, but by My name  <a name="fr_77"></a><a href="#fn_76"><font size="1">a</font></a>
 ‏יהוה‎, I made Me not known to them. <a name="an_exo:6:4">4</a> And I have also established My covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their sojournings, wherein they sojourned. <a name="an_exo:6:5">5</a> And moreover I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered My covenant. <a name="an_exo:6:6">6</a> Wherefore say unto the children of Israel: I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will deliver you from their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm, and with great judgments; <a name="an_exo:6:7">7</a> and I will take you to Me for a people, and I will be to you a God; and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God, who brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. <a name="an_exo:6:8">8</a> And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning which I lifted up My hand to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for a heritage: I am the LORD.' <a name="an_exo:6:9">9</a> And Moses spoke so unto the children of Israel; but they hearkened not unto Moses for impatience of spirit, and for cruel bondage.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_exo:6:10">10</a> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: <a name="an_exo:6:11">11</a> 'Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.' <a name="an_exo:6:12">12</a> And Moses spoke before the LORD, saying: 'Behold, the children of Israel have <a name="page_71"><font size="1" color="green">p. 71</font></a> not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips?'</p>  
 <p><a name="an_exo:6:13">13</a> And the LORD spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.</p>

These are that Moses and Aaron. <a name="an_exo:6:28">28</a> And it came to pass on the day when the LORD spoke unto Moses in the land of Egypt, <a name="an_exo:6:29">29</a> that the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 'I am the LORD; speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I speak unto thee.' <a name="an_exo:6:30">30</a> And Moses said before the LORD: 'Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?'</p>
