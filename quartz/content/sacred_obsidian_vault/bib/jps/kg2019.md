 <p><a name="an_kg2:19:1">1</a> And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD. <a name="an_kg2:19:2">2</a> And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz. <a name="an_kg2:19:3">3</a> And they said unto him: `Thus saith Hezekiah: This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of contumely; for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth. <a name="an_kg2:19:4">4</a> It may be the LORD thy God will hear all the words of Rab-shakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to taunt the living God, and will rebuke the words which the LORD thy God hath heard; wherefore make prayer for the remnant that is left.' <a name="an_kg2:19:5">5</a> So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah. <a name="an_kg2:19:6">6</a> And Isaiah said unto them: `Thus shall ye say to your master: Thus saith the LORD: Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me. <a name="an_kg2:19:7">7</a> Behold, I will put a spirit in him, and he shall hear a rumour, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.'</p>  
 <p><a name="an_kg2:19:8">8</a> So Rab-shakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah; for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish. <a name="an_kg2:19:9">9</a> And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia: `Behold, he is come out to fight against thee'; he sent messengers again unto Hezekiah, saying: <a name="an_kg2:19:10">10</a> `Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying: Let not thy God in whom thou trustest beguile thee, saying: Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria. <a name="an_kg2:19:11">11</a> Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered? <a name="an_kg2:19:12">12</a> Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden that were in Telassar? <a name="an_kg2:19:13">13</a> Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?'</p>  
 <p><a name="an_kg2:19:14">14</a> And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD. <a name="an_kg2:19:15">15</a> And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD, and said: `O LORD, the God of Israel, that sittest upon the cherubim, Thou art the God,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_469"><font size="1" color="green">p. 469</font></a></p>  
 <p>even Thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; Thou hast made heaven and earth. <a name="an_kg2:19:16">16</a> Incline Thine ear, O LORD, and hear; open Thine eyes, O LORD, and see; and hear the words of Sennacherib, wherewith he hath sent him to taunt the living God. <a name="an_kg2:19:17">17</a> Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste the nations and their lands, <a name="an_kg2:19:18">18</a> and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them. <a name="an_kg2:19:19">19</a> Now therefore, O LORD our God, save Thou us, I beseech Thee, out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that Thou art the LORD God, even Thou only.'</p>  
 <p><a name="an_kg2:19:20">20</a> Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying: `Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: Whereas thou hast prayed to Me against Sennacherib king of Assyria, I have heard thee. <a name="an_kg2:19:21">21</a> This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning him:</p>  
 <p>The virgin daughter of Zion<br> Hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn;<br> The daughter of Jerusalem<br> Hath shaken her head at thee.<br> <a name="an_kg2:19:22">22</a> Whom hast thou taunted and blasphemed?<br> And against whom hast thou exalted thy voice?<br> Yea, thou hast lifted up thine eyes on high,<br> Even against the Holy One of Israel!<br> <a name="an_kg2:19:23">23</a> By thy messengers thou hast taunted the Lord,<br> And hast said: With the multitude of my chariots<br> Am I come up to the height of the mountains,<br> To the innermost parts of Lebanon;<br> And I have cut down the tall cedars thereof,<br> And the choice cypresses thereof ;<br> And I have entered into his farthest lodge,<br> The forest of his fruitful field.<br> <a name="an_kg2:19:24">24</a> I have digged and drunk<br> Strange waters,<br> And with the sole of my feet have I dried up<br> All the rivers of Egypt.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_kg2:19:25">25</a> Hast thou not heard?<br> Long ago I made it,<br> In ancient times I fashioned it;<br> Now have I brought it to pass,<br> Yea, it is done; that fortified cities<br> Should be laid waste into ruinous heaps.<br> <a name="an_kg2:19:26">26</a> Therefore their inhabitants were of small power,<br> They were dismayed and confounded;<br> They were as the grass of the field,<br> And as the green herb,<br> As the grass on the housetops,<br> And as corn blasted before it is grown up.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_kg2:19:27">27</a> But I know thy sitting down, and thy going out, and thy coming in,<br> And thy raging against Me.<br> <a name="an_kg2:19:28">28</a> Because of thy raging against Me,<br> And for that thy tumult is come up into Mine ears,<br> Therefore will I put My hook in thy nose,<br> And My bridle in thy lips,<br> And I will turn thee back by the way<br> By which thou camest.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_kg2:19:29">29</a> And this shall be the sign unto thee: ye shall eat this year that which groweth of itself, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof. <a name="an_kg2:19:30">30</a> And the remnant that is escaped of the house of</p>  
 <p><a name="page_470"><font size="1" color="green">p. 470</font></a></p>  
 <p>Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward. <a name="an_kg2:19:31">31</a> For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out of mount Zion they that shall escape; the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall perform this. <a name="an_kg2:19:32">32</a> Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria: He shall not come unto this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither shall he come before it with shield, nor cast a mound against it. <a name="an_kg2:19:33">33</a> By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and he shall not come unto this city, saith the LORD. <a name="an_kg2:19:34">34</a> For I will defend this city to save it, for Mine own sake, and for My servant David's sake.'</p>  
 <p><a name="an_kg2:19:35">35</a> And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred fourscore and five thousand; and when men arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses. <a name="an_kg2:19:36">36</a> So Sennachcrib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh. <a name="an_kg2:19:37">37</a> And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sarezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.</p>
