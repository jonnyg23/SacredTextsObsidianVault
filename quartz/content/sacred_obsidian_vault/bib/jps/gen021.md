 <p><a name="an_gen:21:1">1</a> And the LORD remembered Sarah as He had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as He had spoken. <a name="an_gen:21:2">2</a> And Sarah conceived, and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him. <a name="an_gen:21:3">3</a> And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac. <a name="an_gen:21:4">4</a> And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him. <a name="an_gen:21:5">5</a> And Abraham was a hundred years old, when his son Isaac was' born unto him. <a name="an_gen:21:6">6</a> And Sarah said: 'God hath made laughter for me; every one that heareth will laugh on account of me.' <a name="an_gen:21:7">7</a> And she said: 'Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should give children suck? for I have borne him a son in his old age.'</p>  
 <p><a name="an_gen:21:8">8</a> And the child grew, and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned. <a name="an_gen:21:9">9</a> And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne unto Abraham, making sport. <a name="an_gen:21:10">10</a> Wherefore she said unto Abraham: 'Cast out this bondwoman and her son; for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.' <a name="an_gen:21:11">11</a> And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight on account of his son. <a name="an_gen:21:12">12</a> And God said unto Abraham: 'Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah saith unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall seed be called to thee. <a name="an_gen:21:13">13</a> And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.' <a name="an_gen:21:14">14</a> And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away; and she departed, and strayed in the wilderness of Beer-sheba. <a name="an_gen:21:15">15</a> And the water in the bottle was spent, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs. <a name="an_gen:21:16">16</a> And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot; for she said: 'Let me not look upon the death of the child.' And she sat over against him, and lifted up her voice, and wept. <a name="an_gen:21:17">17</a> And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her: 'What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is. <a name="an_gen:21:18">18</a> Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him fast by thy hand; for I will make him a great nation.' <a name="an_gen:21:19">19</a> And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink. <a name="an_gen:21:20">20</a> And God was with the lad, and he grew; and he dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer. <a name="an_gen:21:21">21</a> And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran; and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_gen:21:22">22</a> And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his host spoke unto Abraham, saying: 'God is with thee in all that thou doest. <a name="an_gen:21:23">23</a> Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son; but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.' <a name="an_gen:21:24">24</a> And Abraham said: 'I will swear.' <a name="an_gen:21:25">25</a> And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of the well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away. <a name="an_gen:21:26">26</a> And Abimelech said: 'I know not <a name="page_24"><font size="1" color="green">p. 24</font></a> who hath done this thing; neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to-day.' <a name="an_gen:21:27">27</a> And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and they two made a covenant. <a name="an_gen:21:28">28</a> And Abraham set seven ewe-lambs of the flock by themselves. <a name="an_gen:21:29">29</a> And Abimelech said unto Abraham: 'What mean these seven ewe-lambs which thou hast set by themselves?' <a name="an_gen:21:30">30</a> And he said: 'Verily, these seven ewe-lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that it may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.' <a name="an_gen:21:31">31</a> Wherefore that place was called Beer-sheba; because there they swore both of them. <a name="an_gen:21:32">32</a> So they made a covenant at Beer-sheba; and Abimelech rose up, and Phicol the captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines. <a name="an_gen:21:33">33</a> And Abraham planted a tamarisk-tree in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the Everlasting God. <a name="an_gen:21:34">34</a> And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days.</p>
