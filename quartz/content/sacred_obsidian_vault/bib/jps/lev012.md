 <p><a name="an_lev:12:1">1</a> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: <a name="an_lev:12:2">2</a> Speak unto the children of Israel, saying:</p>  
 <p>If a woman be delivered, and bear a man-child, then she shall be unclean seven days; as in the days of the impurity of her sickness shall she be unclean. <a name="an_lev:12:3">3</a> And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised. <a name="an_lev:12:4">4</a> And she shall continue in the blood of purification three and thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purification be fulfilled. <a name="an_lev:12:5">5</a> But if she bear a maid-child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her impurity; and she shall continue in the blood of purification threescore and six days. <a name="an_lev:12:6">6</a> And when the days of her purification are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt-offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtle-dove, for a sin-offering, unto the door of the <a name="page_132"><font size="1" color="green">p. 132</font></a> tent of meeting, unto the priest. <a name="an_lev:12:7">7</a> And he shall offer it before the LORD, and make atonement for her; and she shall be cleansed from the fountain of her blood. This is the law for her that beareth, whether a male or a female. <a name="an_lev:12:8">8</a> And if her means suffice not for a lamb, then she shall take two turtledoves, or two young pigeons: the one for a burnt-offering, and the other for a sin-offering; and the priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be clean.</p>
