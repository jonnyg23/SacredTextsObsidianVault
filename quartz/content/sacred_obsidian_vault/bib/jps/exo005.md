 <p><a name="an_exo:5:1">1</a> And afterward Moses and Aaron came, and said unto Pharaoh: Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: Let My people go, that they may hold a feast unto Me in the wilderness.' <a name="an_exo:5:2">2</a> And Pharaoh said: 'Who is the LORD, that I should hearken unto His voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, and moreover I will not let Israel go.' <a name="an_exo:5:3">3</a> And they said: 'The God of the Hebrews hath met with us. Let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice unto the LORD our God; lest He fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.' <a name="an_exo:5:4">4</a> And the king of Egypt said unto them: 'Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, cause the people to break loose from their work? get you unto your burdens.' <a name="an_exo:5:5">5</a> And Pharaoh said: 'Behold, the people of the land are now many, and will ye make them rest from their burdens?' <a name="an_exo:5:6">6</a> And the same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying: <a name="an_exo:5:7">7</a> 'Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore. Let them go and gather straw for themselves. <a name="an_exo:5:8">8</a> And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish aught thereof; for they are idle; therefore they cry, saying: Let us go and sacrifice to our God. <a name="an_exo:5:9">9</a> Let heavier work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard lying words.' <a name="an_exo:5:10">10</a> And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying: 'Thus saith Pharaoh: I will not give you straw. <a name="an_exo:5:11">11</a> Go yourselves, get you straw where ye can find it; for nought <a name="page_70"><font size="1" color="green">p. 70</font></a> of your work shall be diminished.' <a name="an_exo:5:12">12</a> So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw. <a name="an_exo:5:13">13</a> And the taskmasters were urgent, saying: 'Fulfil your work, your daily task, as when there was straw.' <a name="an_exo:5:14">14</a> And the officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, saying: 'Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your appointed task in making brick both yesterday and to-day as heretofore?' <a name="an_exo:5:15">15</a> Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying: 'Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants? <a name="an_exo:5:16">16</a> There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us: Make brick; and, behold, thy servants are beaten, but the fault is in thine own people.' <a name="an_exo:5:17">17</a> But he said: 'Ye are idle, ye are idle; therefore ye say: Let us go and sacrifice to the LORD. <a name="an_exo:5:18">18</a> Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks. <a name="an_exo:5:19">19</a> And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were set on mischief, when they said: 'Ye shall not diminish aught from your bricks, your daily task.' <a name="an_exo:5:20">20</a> And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh; <a name="an_exo:5:21">21</a> and they said unto them: 'The LORD look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.' <a name="an_exo:5:22">22</a> And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said: 'Lord, wherefore hast Thou dealt ill with this people? why is it that Thou hast sent me? <a name="an_exo:5:23">23</a> For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Thy name, he hath dealt ill with this people; neither hast Thou delivered Thy people at all.'</p>
