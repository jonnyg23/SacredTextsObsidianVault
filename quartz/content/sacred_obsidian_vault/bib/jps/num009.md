 <p><a name="an_num:9:1">1</a> And the LORD spoke unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying: <a name="an_num:9:2">2</a> `Let the children of Israel keep the passover in its appointed season. <a name="an_num:9:3">3</a> In the fourteenth day of this month, at dusk, ye shall keep it in its appointed season; according to all the statutes of it, and according to all the ordinances thereof, shall ye keep it.' <a name="an_num:9:4">4</a> And Moses spoke unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover. <a name="an_num:9:5">5</a> And they kept the passover in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, at dusk, in the wilderness of Sinai; according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel. <a name="an_num:9:6">6</a> But there were certain men, who were unclean by the dead body of a man, so that they could not keep the passover on that day; and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day. <a name="an_num:9:7">7</a> And those men said unto him: `We are unclean by the dead body of a man; wherefore are we to be kept back, so as not to bring the offering of the LORD in its appointed season among the children of Israel?' <a name="an_num:9:8">8</a> And Moses said unto them: `Stay ye, that I may hear what the LORD will command concerning you.'</p>  
 <p><a name="an_num:9:9">9</a> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: <a name="an_num:9:10">10</a> `Speak unto the children of Israel, saying: If any man of you or of your generations shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the LORD; <a name="an_num:9:11">11</a> in the second month on the fourteenth day at dusk they shall keep it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs; <a name="an_num:9:12">12</a> they shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break a bone thereof; according to all the statute of the passover they shall keep it. <a name="an_num:9:13">13</a> But the man that is clean, and is not on a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, that soul shall be cut off from his people; because he brought not the offering of the LORD in its appointed season, that man shall bear his sin. <a name="an_num:9:14">14</a> And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover unto the LORD: according to the statute of the passover, and according to the ordinance thereof, so shall he do; ye shall have one statute, both for the stranger, and for him that is born in the land.'</p>

 <p><a name="an_num:9:15">15</a> And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, even the tent of the testimony; and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the s appearance of fire, until morning. <a name="an_num:9:16">16</a> So it was alway: the cloud covered it, and the appearance of fire by night. <a name="an_num:9:17">17</a> And whenever the cloud was taken up from over the Tent, then after that the children of Israel journeyed; and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel encamped. <a name="an_num:9:18">18</a> At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of the LORD they encamped: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they remained encamped. <a name="an_num:9:19">19</a> And when the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed not. <a name="an_num:9:20">20</a> And sometimes the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; according to the commandment of the</p>

 <p>LORD they remained encamped, and according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed. <a name="an_num:9:21">21</a> And sometimes the cloud was from evening until morning; and when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they journeyed; or if it continued by day and by night, when the cloud was taken up, they journeyed. <a name="an_num:9:22">22</a> Whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, abiding thereon, the children of Israel remained encamped, and journeyed not; but when it was taken up, they journeyed. <a name="an_num:9:23">23</a> At the commandment of the LORD they encamped, and at the commandment of the LORD they journeyed; they kept the charge of the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.</p>
