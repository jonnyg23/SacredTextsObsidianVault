 <p><a name="an_num:28:1">1</a> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: <a name="an_num:28:2">2</a> Command the children of Israel, and say unto them:</p>  
 <p>My food which is presented unto Me for offerings made by fire, of a sweet savour unto Me, shall ye observe to offer unto Me in its due season. <a name="an_num:28:3">3</a> And thou shalt say unto them: This is the offering made by fire which ye shall bring unto the LORD: he-lambs of the first year without blemish, two day by day, for a continual burnt-offering. <a name="an_num:28:4">4</a> The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb shalt thou offer at dusk; <a name="an_num:28:5">5</a> and the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil. <a name="an_num:28:6">6</a> It is a continual burnt-offering, which was offered in mount Sinai, for a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD. <a name="an_num:28:7">7</a> And the drink-offering thereof shall be the fourth part of a hin for the one lamb; in the holy place shalt thou pour out a drink-offering of strong drink unto the LORD. <a name="an_num:28:8">8</a> And the other lamb shalt thou present at dusk; as the meal-offering of the morning, and as the drink-offering thereof, thou shalt present it, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_num:28:9">9</a> And on the sabbath day two he-lambs of the first year without blemish, and two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, and the drink-offering thereof. <a name="an_num:28:10">10</a> This is the burnt-offering of every sabbath, beside the continual burnt-offering, and the drink-offering thereof.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_num:28:11">11</a> And in your new moons ye shall present a burnt-offering unto the LORD: two young bullocks, and one ram, seven he-lambs of the first year without blemish; <a name="an_num:28:12">12</a> and three tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, for each bullock; and two tenth parts of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, for the one ram; <a name="an_num:28:13">13</a> and a several tenth part of fine flour mingled with oil for a meal-offering unto every lamb; for a burnt-offering of a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD. <a name="an_num:28:14">14</a> And their drink-offerings shall be half a hin of wine for a bullock, and the third part of a hin for the ram, and the fourth part of a hin for a lamb. This is the burnt-offering of every new moon throughout the months of the year. <a name="an_num:28:15">15</a> And one he-goat for a sin-offering unto the LORD; it shall be offered beside the continual burnt-offering, and the drink-offering thereof.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_num:28:16">16</a> And in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, is the LORD's passover. <a name="an_num:28:17">17</a> And on the fifteenth day of this month shall be a feast; seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten. <a name="an_num:28:18">18</a> In the first day shall be a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work; <a name="an_num:28:19">19</a> but ye shall present an offering made by fire, a burnt-offering unto the LORD: two young bullocks, and one ram, and seven he-lambs of the first year; they shall be unto you without blemish; <a name="an_num:28:20">20</a> and their meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil; three tenth parts shall ye offer for a bullock, and two tenth parts for the ram; <a name="an_num:28:21">21</a> a several</p>

 <p>tenth part shalt thou offer for every lamb of the seven lambs; <a name="an_num:28:22">22</a> and one he-goat for a sin-offering, to make atonement for you. <a name="an_num:28:23">23</a> Ye shall offer these beside the burnt-offering of the morning, which is for a continual burnt-offering. <a name="an_num:28:24">24</a> After this manner ye shall offer daily, for seven days, the food of the offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD; it shall be offered beside the continual burnt-offering, and the drink-offering thereof. <a name="an_num:28:25">25</a> And on the seventh day ye shall have a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_num:28:26">26</a> Also in the day of the first-fruits, when ye bring a new meal-offering unto the LORD in your feast of weeks, ye shall have a holy convocation: ye shall do no manner of servile work; <a name="an_num:28:27">27</a> but ye shall present a burnt-offering for a sweet savour unto the LORD: two young bullocks, one ram, seven he-lambs of the first year; <a name="an_num:28:28">28</a> and their meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil, three tenth parts for each bullock, two tenth parts for the one ram, <a name="an_num:28:29">29</a> a several tenth part for every lamb of the seven lambs; <a name="an_num:28:30">30</a> one he-goat, to make atonement for you. <a name="an_num:28:31">31</a> Beside the continual burnt-offering, and the meal-offering thereof, ye shall offer them—they shall be unto you without blemish—and their drink-offerings.</p>
