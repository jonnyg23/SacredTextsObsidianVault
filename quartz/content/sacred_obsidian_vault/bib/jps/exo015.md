 <p><a name="an_exo:15:1">1</a> Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the LORD, and spoke, saying:</p>  
 <p>I will sing unto the LORD, for He is highly exalted;<br> The horse and his rider hath He thrown into the sea.<br> <a name="an_exo:15:2">2</a> The LORD is my strength and song, And<br> He is become my salvation; This is my God, and I will glorify Him;<br> My father's God, and I will exalt Him.<br> <a name="an_exo:15:3">3</a> The LORD is a man of war,<br> The LORD is His name.<br> <a name="an_exo:15:4">4</a> Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath He cast into the sea,<br> And his chosen captains are sunk in the Red Sea.<br> <a name="an_exo:15:5">5</a> The deeps cover them<br> They went down into the depths like a stone.<br> <a name="an_exo:15:6">6</a> Thy right hand, O LORD, glorious in power,<br> Thy right hand, O LORD, dasheth in pieces the enemy. <a name="page_83"><font size="1" color="green">p. 83</font></a><br> <a name="an_exo:15:7">7</a> And in the greatness of Thine excellency Thou overthrowest them that rise up against Thee;<br> Thou sendest forth Thy wrath, it consumeth them as stubble.<br> <a name="an_exo:15:8">8</a> And with the blast of Thy nostrils the waters were piled up—<br> The floods stood upright as a heap; The deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea.<br> <a name="an_exo:15:9">9</a> The enemy said:<br> 'I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil;<br> My lust shall be satisfied upon them;<br> I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.'<br> <a name="an_exo:15:10">10</a> Thou didst blow with Thy wind, the sea covered them;<br> They sank as lead in the mighty waters.<br> <a name="an_exo:15:11">11</a> Who is like unto Thee, O LORD, among the mighty?<br> Who is like unto Thee, glorious in holiness,<br> Fearful in praises, doing wonders?<br> <a name="an_exo:15:12">12</a> Thou stretchedst out Thy right hand—<br> The earth swallowed them.<br> <a name="an_exo:15:13">13</a> Thou in Thy love hast led the people that Thou hast redeemed;<br> Thou hast guided them in Thy strength to Thy holy habitation.<br> <a name="an_exo:15:14">14</a> The peoples have heard, they tremble;<br> Pangs have taken hold on the inhabitants of Philistia.<br> <a name="an_exo:15:15">15</a> Then were the chiefs of Edom affrighted;<br> The mighty men of Moab, trembling taketh hold upon them;<br> All the inhabitants of Canaan are melted away.<br> <a name="an_exo:15:16">16</a> Terror and dread falleth upon them;<br> By the greatness of Thine arm they are as still as a stone;<br> Till Thy people pass over, O LORD,<br> Till the people pass over that Thou hast gotten.<br> <a name="an_exo:15:17">17</a> Thou bringest them in, and plantest them in the mountain of Thine inheritance,<br> The place, O LORD, which Thou hast made for Thee to dwell in,<br> The sanctuary, O Lord, which Thy hands have established.<br> <a name="an_exo:15:18">18</a> The LORD shall reign for ever and ever.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_exo:15:19">19</a> For the horses of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought back the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_exo:15:20">20</a> And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances. <a name="an_exo:15:21">21</a> And Miriam sang unto them:</p>  
 <p>Sing ye to the LORD, for He is highly exalted:<br> The horse and his rider hath He thrown into the sea.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_exo:15:22">22</a> And Moses led Israel onward from the Red Sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water. <a name="an_exo:15:23">23</a> And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter. Therefore the name of it was called  <a name="fr_78"></a><a href="#fn_77"><font size="1">a</font></a>
 Marah. <a name="an_exo:15:24">24</a> And the people murmured against Moses, saying: 'What shall we drink?' <a name="an_exo:15:25">25</a> And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD showed him a tree, and he cast it into the waters, and the waters were made sweet. There He made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there He proved them; <a name="an_exo:15:26">26</a> and He said: 'If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt <a name="page_84"><font size="1" color="green">p. 84</font></a> do that which is right in His eyes, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all His statutes, I will put none of the diseases upon thee, which I have put upon the Egyptians; for I am the LORD that healeth thee.'</p>  
 <p><a name="an_exo:15:27">27</a> And they came to Elim, where were twelve springs of water, and three score and ten palm-trees; and they encamped there by the waters.</p>
