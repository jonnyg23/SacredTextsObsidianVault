 <p><a name="an_jos:2:1">1</a> And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two spies secretly, saying: 'Go view the land, and Jericho.' And they went, and came into the house of a harlot whose name was Rahab, and lay there. <a name="an_jos:2:2">2</a> And it was told the king of Jericho, saying: 'Behold, there came men in hither to-night of the children of Israel to search out the land.' <a name="an_jos:2:3">3</a> And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying: 'Bring forth the men that are come to thee, that are entered into thy house; for they are come to search out all the land.' <a name="an_jos:2:4">4</a> And the woman took the two men, and hid them; and she said: 'Yea, the men came unto me, but I knew not whence they were; <a name="an_jos:2:5">5</a> and it came to pass about the time of the shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out; whither the men went I know not; pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them. <a name="an_jos:2:6">6</a> But she had brought them up to the roof, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had spread out upon the roof. <a name="an_jos:2:7">7</a> And the men pursued after them the way to the Jordan unto the fords; and as soon as they that pursued after them were gone out, the gate was shut. <a name="an_jos:2:8">8</a> And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof; <a name="an_jos:2:9">9</a> and she said unto the men: 'I know that the LORD hath given you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you. <a name="an_jos:2:10">10</a> For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red Sea before you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond the Jordan, unto Sihon and to Og, whom ye utterly destroyed. <a name="an_jos:2:11">11</a> And as soon as we had heard it, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more spirit in any man, because of you; for the LORD your God, He is God in heaven above, and on earth beneath. <a name="an_jos:2:12">12</a> Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD, since I have dealt kindly with you, that ye also will deal kindly with my father's house—and give me a true token <a name="an_jos:2:13">13</a> and save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death.' <a name="an_jos:2:14">14</a> And the men said unto her: 'Our life for yours, if ye tell not this our business; and it shall be, when the LORD giveth us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.' <a name="an_jos:2:15">15</a> Then she let them down by a cord through the window; for her house was upon the side of the wall, and she dwelt upon the wall. <a name="an_jos:2:16">16</a> And she said unto them: 'Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers light upon you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned; and afterward may ye go your way.' <a name="an_jos:2:17">17</a> And the men said unto her: 'We will be guiltless of this thine oath which thou hast made us to swear. <a name="an_jos:2:18">18</a> Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by; and thou shalt gather unto thee into the house thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father's household. <a name="an_jos:2:19">19</a> And it shall be, that whosoever</p>  
 <p><a name="page_263"><font size="1" color="green">p. 263</font></a></p>  
 <p>shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we will be guiltless; and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him. <a name="an_jos:2:20">20</a> But if thou utter this our business, then we will be guiltless of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.' <a name="an_jos:2:21">21</a> And she said: 'According unto your words, so be it.' And she sent them away, and they departed; and she bound the scarlet line in the window. <a name="an_jos:2:22">22</a> And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned; and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found them not. <a name="an_jos:2:23">23</a> Then the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun; and they told him all that had befallen them. <a name="an_jos:2:24">24</a> And they said unto Joshua: 'Truly the LORD hath delivered into our hands all the land; and moreover all the inhabitants of the land do melt away before us.'</p>
