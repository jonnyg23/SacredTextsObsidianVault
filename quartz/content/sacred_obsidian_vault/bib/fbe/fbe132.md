 </i><p>God relates to Enoch, how out of the very lowest darkness comes down the visible and invisible.</p> 
 <p>I COMMANDED in the very lowest <i>parts</i>, that visible things should come down from invisible, and Adoil came down very great, and I beheld him, and lo! he had a belly of great light.</p> 
 <p>2 And I said to him: 'Become undone, Adoil, and let the visible <i>come</i> out of thee.'</p> 
 <p>3 And he came undone, and a great light came out. And I <i>was</i> in the midst of the great light, and as there is born light from light, there came forth a great age, and showed all creation, which I had thought to create.</p> 
 <p>4 And I saw that <i>it was</i> good.</p> 
 <p>5 And I placed for myself a throne, and took my seat on it, and said to the light: 'Go thou up higher and fix thyself high above the throne, and be a foundation to the highest things.'</p> 
 <p>6 And above the light there is nothing else, and then I bent up and looked up from my throne.</p>
