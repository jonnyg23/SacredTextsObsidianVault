 </i><p>Fantastic and not in harmony with the other Odes. The reference to a painless Virgin Birth is notable.</p> 
 <p>1 A cup of milk was offered to me: and I drank it in the sweetness of the delight of the Lord.<br> 2 The Son is the cup, and He who was milked is the Father:<br> 3 And the Holy Spirit milked Him: because His breasts were full, and it was necessary for Him that His milk should be sufficiently released;<br> 4 And the Holy Spirit opened His bosom and mingled the milk from the two breasts of the Father; and gave the mixture to the world without their knowing:<br> 5 And they who receive in its fulness are the ones on the right hand.<br> 6 The Spirit opened the womb of the Virgin and she received conception and brought forth; and the Virgin became a Mother with many mercies;<br> 7 And she travailed and brought forth a Son, without incurring pain;<br> 8 And because she was not sufficiently prepared, and she had not sought a midwife (for He brought her to bear) she brought forth, as if she were a man, of her own will;<br> 9 And she brought Him forth openly, and acquired Him with great dignity,<br> 10 And loved Him in His swaddling clothes and guarded Him kindly, and showed Him in Majesty. Hallelujah.</p>
