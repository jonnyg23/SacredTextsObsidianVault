 </i><p align="CENTER">The first Human thirst.</p> 
 <p>THEN Adam took the fig, and laid it on the golden rods. Eve also took her fig, and put it upon the incense.</p> 
 <p>2 And the weight of each fig was that of a water-melon; for the fruit of the garden was much larger than the fruit of this land.</p> 
 <p>3 But Adam and Eve remained standing and fasting the whole of that night, until the morning dawned.</p> 
 <p>4 When the sun rose they were at their prayers, and Adam said to Eve, after they had done praying:--</p> 
 <p>5 "O Eve, come, let us go to the border of the garden looking south; to the place whence the river flows, and is parted into four heads. There we will pray to God, and ask Him to give us to drink of the Water of Life.</p> 
 <p>6 "For God has not fed us with the Tree of Life, in order that we may not live. We will, therefore, ask him to give us of the Water of Life, and to quench our thirst with it, rather than with a drink of water of this land."</p> 
 <p>7 When Eve heard these words from Adam, she agreed; and they both arose and came to the southern border of the garden, upon the brink of the river of water at some little distance from the garden.</p> 
 <p>8 And they stood and prayed before the Lord, and asked Him to look upon them this once, to forgive them, and to grant them their request.</p> 
 <p>9 After this prayer from both of them, Adam began to pray with his voice before God, and said:--</p> 
 <p>10 "O Lord, when I was in the garden and saw the water that flowed from under the Tree of Life, my heart did not desire, neither did my body require to drink of it; neither did I know thirst, for I was living; and above that which I am now.</p> 
 <p>11 "So that in order to live I did not require any Food of Life, neither did I drink of the Water of Life.</p> 
 <p>12 "But now, O God, I am dead; my flesh is parched with thirst. Give me of the Water of Life that I may drink of it and live.</p> 
 <p>13 "Of Thy mercy, O God, save me from these plagues and trials, and bring me into another land different from this, if Thou wilt not let me dwell in Thy garden."</p>
