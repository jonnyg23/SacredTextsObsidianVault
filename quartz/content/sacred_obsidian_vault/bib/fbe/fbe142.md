 </i><p>God leaves one righteous man of Enoch's tribe with his whole house, who did God's pleasure according to his will.</p> 
 <p>BEHOLD from their seed shall arise another generation, much afterwards, but of them many will be very insatiate.</p> 
 <p>2 He who raises that generation, <i>shall</i> reveal to them the books of thy handwriting, of thy fathers, <i>to them</i> to whom he must point out the guardianship of the world, to the faithful men and workers of my pleasure, who do not acknowledge my name in vain.</p> 
 <p>3 And they shall tell another generation, and those <i>others</i> having read shall be glorified thereafter, more than the first.</p>
