 </i><p align="CENTER">Adam is cautious--but too late.</p> 
 <p>THEN Adam returned to Eve, and said to her, "Arise, and take a fig for thyself, and I will take another; and let us go to our cave."</p> 
 <p>2 Then Adam and Eve took each a fig and went towards the cave; the time was about the setting of the sun; and their thoughts made them long to eat of the fruit.</p> 
 <p>3 But Adam said to Eve, "I am afraid to eat of this fig. I know not what may come upon me from it."</p> 
 <p>4 So Adam wept, and stood praying before God, saying, "Satisfy my hunger, without my having to eat this fig; for after I have eaten it, what will it profit me? And what shall I desire and ask of Thee, O God, when it is gone?"</p> 
 <p>5 And he said again, "I am afraid to eat of it; for I know not what will befall me through it."</p>
