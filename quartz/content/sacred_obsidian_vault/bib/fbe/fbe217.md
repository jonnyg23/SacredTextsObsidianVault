 </i><p>The reference to the sealed document sent by God is one of the great mysteries of the collection.</p> 
 <p>1 Joy is of the saints! and who shall put it on, but they alone?<br> 2 Grace is of the elect! and who shall receive it except those who trust in it from the beginning?<br> 3 Love is of the elect? And who shall put it on except those who have possessed it from the beginning?<br> 4 Walk ye in the knowledge of the Most High without grudging: to His exultation and to the perfection of His knowledge.<br> 5 And His thought was like a letter; His will descended from on high, and it was sent like an arrow which is violently shot from the bow: <a name="page_132"><font size="1" color="green">p. 132</font></a><br> 6 And many hands rushed to the letter to seize it and to take and read it:<br> 7 And it escaped their fingers and they were affrighted at it and at the seal that was upon it.<br> 8 Because it was not permitted to them to loose its seal: for the power that was over the seal was greater than they.<br> 9 But those who saw it went after the letter that they might know where it would alight, and who should read it and who should hear it.<br> 10 But a wheel received it and came over it:<br> 11 And there was with it a sign of the Kingdom and of the Government:<br> 12 And everything which tried to move the wheel it mowed and cut down:<br> 13 And it gathered the multitude of adversaries, and bridged the rivers and crossed over and rooted up many forests and made a broad path.<br> 14 The head went down to the feet, for down to the feet ran the wheel, and that which was a sign upon it.<br> 15 The letter was one of command, for there were included in it all districts;<br> 16 And there was seen at its head, the head which was revealed even the Son of Truth from the Most High Father,<br> 17 And He inherited and took possession of everything. And the thought of many was brought to nought.<br> 18 And all the apostates hasted and fled away. And those who persecuted and were enraged became extinct.<br> 19 And the letter was a great volume, which was wholly written by the. finger of God:<br> 20 And the name of the Father was on it, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, to rule for ever and ever. Hallelujah.</p>
