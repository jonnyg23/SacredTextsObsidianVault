 </i><p>Of how it is fitting to bring one's gift with faith, because there is no repentance after death.</p> 
 <p>BLESSED is the man who in his patience brings his gifts with faith before the Lord's face, because he will find forgiveness of sins.</p> 
 <p>2 But if he take back his words before the time, there is no repentance for him; and if the time pass and he do not of his own will what is promised, there is no repentance after death.</p> 
 <p>3 Because every work which man does before the time, is all deceit before men, and sin before God.</p>
