 </i><p align="CENTER">True poetry--pure and simple.</p> 
 <p>1 No way is hard where there is a simple heart.<br> 2 Nor is there any wound where the thoughts are upright:<br> 3 Nor is there any storm in the depth of the illuminated thought:<br> 4 Where one is surrounded on every side by beauty, there is nothing that is divided.<br> 5 The likeness of what is below is that which is above; for everything is above: what is below is nothing but the imagination of those that are without knowledge.<br> 6 Grace has been revealed for your salvation. Believe and live and be saved. Hallelujah.</p>
