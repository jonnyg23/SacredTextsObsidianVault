 <p>1 As the wings of doves over their nestlings; and the mouth of their nestlings towards their mouths.<br> 2 So also are the wings of the Spirit over my heart:<br> 3 My heart is delighted and exults: like the babe who exults in the womb of his mother:<br> 4 I believed; therefore I was at rest; for faithful is He in whom I have believed:<br> 5 He has richly blessed me and my head is with Him: and the sword shall not divide me from Him, nor the scimitar;<br> 6 For I am ready before destruction comes; and I have been set on His immortal pinions:<br> 7 And He showed me His sign: forth and given me to drink, and from that life is the spirit within me, and it cannot die, for it lives.<br> 8 They who saw me marvelled at me, because I was persecuted, and they supposed that I was swallowed up: for I seemed to them as one of the lost;<br> 9 And my oppression became my salvation; and I was their reprobation because there was no zeal in me;<br> 10 Because I did good to every man I was hated,<br> 11 And they came round me like mad dogs, who ignorantly attack their masters,<br> 12 For their thought is corrupt and their understanding perverted.<br> 13 But I was carrying water in my right hand, and their bitterness I endured by my sweetness;<br> 14 And I did not perish, for I was not their brother nor was my birth like theirs.<br> 15 And they sought for my death and did not find it: for I was older than the memorial of them;<br> 16 And vainly did they make attack upon me and those who, without reward, came after me:<br> 17 They sought to destroy the memorial of him who was before them.<br> 18 For the thought of the Most High cannot be anticipated; and His heart is superior to all wisdom. Hallelujah.</p>
