 </i><p>Then it became evening, and then again morning, and it was the second day. [<i>Monday is the first day</i>.] <i>The fiery Essence</i>.</p> 
 <p>AND for all the heavenly troops I imaged the image and essence of fire, and my eye looked at the very hard, firm rock, and from the gleam of my eye the lightning received its wonderful nature, <i>which</i> is both fire in water and water in fire, and one does not put out the other, nor does the one dry up the other, therefore the lightning is brighter than the sun, softer than water and firmer than hard rock.</p> 
 <p>2 And from the rock I cut off a great fire, and from the fire I created the orders of the incorporeal ten troops of angels, and their weapons are fiery and their raiment a burning flame, and I commanded that each one should stand in his order.</p> <i>
 </i><p>Here Satanail with his angels was thrown down from the height.</p> 
 <p>3 And one from out the order of angels, having turned away with the order that was under him, conceived an impossible thought, to place his throne higher than the clouds above the earth, that he might become equal in rank to my power.</p> 
 <p>4 And I threw him out from the height with his angels, and he was flying in the air continuously above the bottomless.</p>
