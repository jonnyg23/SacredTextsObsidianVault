 </i><p>The mention of the Dove refers to a lost Gospel to which there are rare references in ancient writings.</p> 
 <p>1 The Dove fluttered over the Messiah, because He was her head; and she sang over Him and her voice was heard:<br> 2 And the inhabitants were afraid and the sojourners were moved:<br> 3 The birds dropped their wings and all creeping things died in their holes: and the abysses were opened which had been hidden; and they cried to the Lord like women in travail:<br> 4 And no food was given to them, because it did not belong to them;<br> 5 And they sealed up the abysses with the seal of the Lord. And they perished, in the thought, those that had existed from ancient times;<br> 6 For they were corrupt from the beginning; and the end of their corruption was life:<br> 7 And every one of them that was imperfect perished: for it was not possible to give them a word that they might remain:<br> 8 And the Lord destroyed the imaginations of all them that had not the truth with them.<br> 9 For they who in their hearts were lifted up were deficient in wisdom, and so they were rejected, because the truth was not with them. <a name="page_133"><font size="1" color="green">p. 133</font></a><br> 10 For the Lord disclosed His way, and spread abroad His grace: and those who understood it, know His holiness. Hallelujah.</p>
