 <p align="CENTER">"<i>They became insolent in their prosperity . . . .</i>"</p> 
 <p>I cried unto the Lord when I was in distress,<br>   Unto God when sinners assailed.<br> Suddenly the alarm of war was heard before me;<br>   I said, He will hearken to me for I am full of righteousness.<br> I thought in my heart that I was full of righteousness,<br>   Because I was well off and had become rich in children.<br> Their wealth spread to the whole earth,<br>   And their glory unto the end of the earth.<br> They were exalted unto the stars;<br>   They said they would never fan.<br> But they became insolent in their prosperity,<br>   And they were without understanding,<br> Their sins were in secret,<br>   And even I had no knowledge of them.<br> Their transgressions went beyond those of the heathen before them;<br>   They utterly polluted the holy things of the Lord.</p>
