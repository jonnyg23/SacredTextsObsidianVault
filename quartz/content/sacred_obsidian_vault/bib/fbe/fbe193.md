 </i><p>"They set a worldly monarchy . . . . they lay waste the Throne of David!' A poetic narrative about the utter disintegration of a great nation.</p> 
 <p>O Lord, Thou art our King for ever and ever,<br>   For in Thee, O God, doth our soul glory.<br> How long are the days of man's life upon the earth?<br>   As are his days, so is the hope set upon him.<br> But <i>we</i> hope in God, our deliverer;<br> For the might of our God is for ever with mercy,<br>   And the kingdom of our God is for ever over the nations in judgement.</p> 
 <p>Thou, O Lord, didst choose David to be king over Israel,<br>   And swaredst to him touching his seed that never should his kingdom fail before Thee.<br> But, for our sins, sinners rose up against us;<br>   They assailed us and thrust us out;<br>   What Thou hadst not promised to them, they took away from us with violence.<br> They in no wise glorified Thy honourable name;<br>   They set a worldly monarchy in place of that which was their excellency;<br>   They laid waste the throne of David in tumultuous arrogance.<br> But Thou, O God, didst cast them down, and remove their seed from the earth,<br>   In that there rose up against them a man that was alien to our race.<br> According to their sins didst Thou recompense them, O God;<br>   So that it befell them according to their deeds.<br> God showed them no pity;<br>   He sought out their seed and let not one of them go free.<br> Faithful is the Lord in all His judgements<br>   Which He doeth upon the earth.</p> 
 <p>The lawless one laid waste our land so that none inhabited it,<br>   They destroyed young and old and their children together.<br> In the heat of His anger He sent them away even unto the west,<br>   And He exposed the rulers of the land unsparingly to derision.<br> Being an alien the enemy acted proudly,<br>   And his heart was alien from Our God.<br> And all things whatsoever he did in Jerusalem,<br>   As also the nations in the cities to their gods.</p> 
 <p>And the children of the covenant in the midst of the mingled peoples surpassed them in evil.<br>   There was not among them one that wrought in the midst of Jerusalem mercy and truth.<br> They that loved the synagogues of the pious fled from them,<br>   As sparrows that fly from their nest.<br> They wandered in deserts that their lives might be saved from harm, <a name="page_118"><font size="1" color="green">p. 118</font></a><br>   And precious in the eyes of them that lived abroad was any that escaped alive from them.<br>   Over the whole earth were they scattered by lawless men.<br> For the heavens withheld the rain from dropping upon the earth,<br>   Springs were stopped that sprang perennially out of the deeps, that ran down from lofty mountains.<br> For there was none among them that wrought righteousness and justice;<br>   From the chief of them to the least of them all were sinful;<br>   The king was a transgressor, and the judge disobedient, and the people sinful.<br> Behold, O Lord, and raise up unto them their king, the son of David,<br>   At the time in the which Thou seest, O God, that he may reign over Israel Thy servant.<br> And gird him with strength, that he may shatter unrighteous rulers,<br>   And that he may purge Jerusalem from nations that trample her down to destruction.<br> Wisely, righteously he shall thrust out sinners from the inheritance,<br>   He shall destroy the pride of the sinner as a potter's vessel.<br> With a rod of iron he shall break in pieces all their substance,<br>   He shall destroy the godless nations with the word of his mouth;<br> At his rebuke nations shall flee before him,<br>   And he shall reprove sinners for the thoughts of their heart.</p> 
 <p>And he shall gather together a holy people, whom he shall lead in righteousness,<br>   And he shall judge the tribes of the people that has been sanctified by the Lord his God.<br> And he shall not suffer unrighteousness to lodge any more in their midst,<br>   Nor shall there dwell with them any man that knoweth wickedness,<br>   For he shall know them, that they are all sons of their God.<br> And he shall divide them according to their tribes upon the land,<br>   And neither sojourner nor alien shall sojourn with them any more.<br> He shall judge peoples and nations in the wisdom of his righteousness. <i>Selah</i>.</p> 
 <p>And he shall have the heathen nations to serve him under his yoke;<br>   And he shall glorify the Lord in a place to be seen of all the earth;<br>   And he shall purge Jerusalem, making it holy as of old:<br> So that nations shall come from the ends of the earth to see his glory,<br>   Bringing as gifts her sons who had fainted.<br>   And to see the glory of the Lord, wherewith God hath glorified her.<br> And he shall be a righteous king, taught of God, over them,<br> And there shall be no unrighteousness in his days in their midst,<br>   For all shall be holy and their king the anointed of the Lord.<br> For he shall not put his trust in horse and rider and bow,<br>   Nor shall he multiply for himself gold and silver for war,</p> 
 <p>Nor shall he gather confidence from a multitude for the day of battle. <a name="page_119"><font size="1" color="green">p. 119</font></a><br> The Lord Himself is his king, the hope of him that is mighty through his hope in God.</p> 
 <p>All nations shall be in fear before him,<br>   For he will smite the earth with the word of his mouth for ever.<br> He will bless the people of the Lord with wisdom and gladness,<br>   And he himself will be pure from sin, so that he may rule a great people.<br> He will rebuke rulers, and remove sinners by the might of his word;<br>   And relying upon his God, throughout his days he will not stumble;<br> For God will make him mighty by means of His holy spirit,<br>   And wise by means of the spirit of understanding, with strength and righteousness.<br> And the blessing of the Lord will be with him: he will be strong and stumble not;<br>   His hope will be in the Lord: who then can prevail against him?<br> He will, be mighty in his works, and strong in the fear of God,<br>   He will be shepherding the flock of the Lord faithfully and righteously,<br>   And will suffer none among them to stumble in their pasture.<br> He will lead them all aright,<br>   And there will be no pride among them that any among them should be oppressed.<br> This will be the majesty of the king of Israel whom God knoweth;<br>   He will raise him up over the house of Israel to correct him.<br> His words shall be more refined than costly gold, the choicest;<br>   In the assemblies he will judge the peoples, the tribes of the sanctified.<br> His words shall be like the words of the holy ones in the midst of sanctified peoples.<br> Blessed be they that shall be in those days,<br>   In that they shall see the good fortune of Israel which God shall bring to pass in the gathering together of the tribes.<br> May the Lord hasten His mercy upon Israel!<br>   May He deliver us from the uncleanness of unholy enemies!<br> The Lord Himself is our king for ever and ever.</p>
