 </i><p>Of how none born on earth can remain hidden nor his work remain concealed, but he (sc. God) bids us be meek, to endure attack and insult, and not to offend widows and orphans.</p> 
 <p>I HAVE put everyman's work in writing and none born on earth can remain hidden nor his works remain concealed.</p> 
 <p>2 I see all things.</p> 
 <p>3 Now therefore, my children, in patience and meekness spend the number of your days, that you inherit endless life.</p> 
 <p>4 Endure for the sake of the Lord every wound, every injury, every evil word and attack.</p> 
 <p>5 If ill-requitals befall you, return <i>them</i> not either to neighbour or enemy, because the Lord will return <i>them</i> for you and be your avenger on the day of great judgement, that there be no avenging here among men.</p> 
 <p>6 Whoever of you spends gold or silver for his brother's sake, he will receive ample treasure in the world to come.</p> 
 <p>7 Injure not widows nor orphans nor strangers, lest God's wrath come upon you.</p>
