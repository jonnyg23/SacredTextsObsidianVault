 </i><p>Gad exhorts his listeners against hatred showing how it has brought him into so much trouble. Verses 8-11 are memorable.</p> 
 <p>AND now, my children, I exhort you, love ye each one his brother, and put away hatred from your hearts, love</p> 
 <p><a name="page_256"><font size="1" color="green">p. 256</font></a></p> 
 <p>one another in deed, and in word, and in the inclination of the soul.</p> 
 <p>2 For in the presence of my father I spake peaceably to Joseph; and when I had gone out, the spirit of hatred darkened my mind, and stirred up my soul to slay him.</p> 
 <p>3 Love ye one another from the heart; and if a man sin against thee, speak peaceably to him, and in thy soul hold not guile; and if he repent and confess, forgive him.</p> 
 <p>4 But if he deny it, do not get into a passion with him, lest catching the poison from thee he take to swearing and so thou sin doubly.</p> 
 <p>5 Let not another man hear thy secrets when engaged in legal strife, lest he come to hate thee and become thy enemy, and commit a great sin against thee; for ofttimes he addresseth thee guilefully or busieth himself about thee with wicked intent.</p> 
 <p>6 And though he deny it and yet have a sense of shame when reproved, give over reproving him.</p> 
 <p>7 For be who denieth may repent so as not again to wrong thee; yea, he may also honour thee, and fear and be at peace with thee.</p> 
 <p>8 And if he be shameless and persist in his wrong-doing, even so forgive him from the heart, and leave to God the avenging.</p> 
 <p>9 If a man prospereth more than you, do not be vexed, but pray also for him, that he may have perfect prosperity.</p> 
 <p>10 for so it is expedient for you.</p> 
 <p>11 And if he be further exalted, be not envious of him, remembering that all flesh shall die; and offer praise to God, who giveth things good and profitable to all men.</p> 
 <p>12 Seek out the judgments of the Lord, and thy mind will rest and be at peace.</p> 
 <p>13 And though a man become rich by evil means, even as Esau, the brother of my father, be not jealous; but wait for the end of the Lord.</p> 
 <p>14 For if he taketh away from a man wealth gotten by evil means He forgiveth him if he repent, but the unrepentant is reserved for eternal punishment.</p> 
 <p>15 For the poor man, if free from envy he pleaseth the Lord in all things, is blessed beyond all men, because he hath not the travail of vain men.</p> 
 <p>16 Put away, therefore, jealousy from your souls, and love one another with uprightness of heart.</p> 
 <p>17 Do ye also therefore tell these things to your children, that they honour Judah and Levi, for from them shall the Lord raise up salvation to Israel.</p> 
 <p>18 For I know that at the last your children shall depart from Him, and shall walk in O wickedness, and affliction and corruption before the Lord.</p> 
 <p>19 And when he had rested for a little while, he said again; My children, obey your father, and bury me near to my fathers.</p> 
 <p>20 And he drew up his feet, and fell asleep in peace.</p> 
 <p>21 And after five years they carried him up to Hebron, and laid him with his fathers.</p>
