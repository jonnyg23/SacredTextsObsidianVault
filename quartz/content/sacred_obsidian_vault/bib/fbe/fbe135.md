 </i><p>The week in which God showed Enoch all his wisdom and power, throughout all the seven days, how he created all the heavenly and earthly forces and all moving things even down to man.</p> 
 <p>AND then I made firm the heavenly circle, and <i>made</i> that the lower water which is under heaven collect itself together, into one whole, and that the chaos become dry, and it became so.</p> 
 <p>2 Out of the waves I created rock hard and big, and from the rock I piled up the dry, and the dry I called earth, and the midst of the earth I called abyss, that is to say the bottomless, I collected the sea in one place and bound it together with a yoke.</p> 
 <p>3 And I said to the sea: 'Behold I give thee <i>thy</i> eternal limits, and thou shalt not break loose from thy component parts.'</p> 
 <p>4 Thus I made fast the firmament. This day I called me the first-created.</p>
