 </i><p>A vigorous little Ode in which Christ Himself is the speaker.</p> 
 <p>1 The Lord hath directed my mouth by His word: and He hath opened my heart by His light: and He hath caused to dwell in me His deathless life;<br> 2 And gave me that I might speak the fruit of His peace:<br> 3 To convert the souls of them who are willing to come to Him; and to lead captive a good captivity for freedom.<br> 4 I was strengthened and made mighty and took the world captive;<br> 5 And it became to me for the praise of the Most High, and of God my Father.<br> 6 And the Gentiles were gathered together who were scattered abroad.<br> 7 And I was unpolluted by my love for them, because they confessed me in high places: and the traces of the light were set upon their heart:<br> 8 And they walked in my life and were saved and became my people for ever and ever. Hallelujah.</p>
