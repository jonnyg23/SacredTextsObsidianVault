 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 50</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> The word that the LORD spake against <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> and against the land of the Chaldeans by <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Declare ye among the nations, and publish, and set up a standard; publish, and conceal not: say, <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> is taken, <a href="../ebd/ebd051.htm#005">Bel</a> is confounded, <a href="../ebd/ebd250.htm#001">Merodach</a> is broken in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a>; her idols are confounded, her images are broken in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they shall remove, they shall depart, both man and <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> shall come, they and the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> together, going and weeping: they shall go, and seek the LORD their God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> They shall ask the way to <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a> with their faces thitherward, saying, Come, and let us join ourselves to the LORD in a perpetual <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> that shall not be forgotten.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> My people hath been lost <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>: their shepherds have caused them to go astray, they have turned them away on the mountains: they have gone from mountain to hill, they have forgotten their restingplace.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries said, We offend not, because they have sinned against the LORD, the <a href="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd214.htm#007">justice</a>, even the LORD, the hope of their fathers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Remove out of the midst of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he goats before the flocks.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> For, lo, I will raise and cause to come up against <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> an assembly of great nations from the north country: and they shall set themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken: their <a href="../ebd/ebd032.htm#005">arrows</a> shall be as of a mighty expert man; none shall return in vain.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd076.htm#000">Chaldea</a> shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be satisfied, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of mine heritage, because ye are grown <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</a> as the <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#006">heifer</a> at <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</a>, and bellow as bulls;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Your mother shall be sore confounded; she that bare you shall be ashamed: behold, the hindermost of the nations shall be a <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, a dry land, and a <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#000">desert</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited, but it shall be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> shall be astonished, and <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#005">hiss</a> at all her plagues.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Put yourselves in array against <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> round about: all ye that bend the <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a>, shoot at her, spare no <a href="../ebd/ebd032.htm#005">arrows</a>: for she hath sinned against the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Shout against her round about: she hath given her hand: her foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down: for it is the vengeance of the LORD: take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, do unto her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Cut off the sower from <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, and him that handleth the <a href="../ebd/ebd342.htm#008">sickle</a> in the time of <a href="../ebd/ebd165.htm#008">harvest</a>: for fear of the oppressing <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his own land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> is a scattered <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>; the <a href="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</a> have driven him away: first the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</a> hath devoured him; and last this <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#006">Nebuchadrezzar</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> hath broken his bones.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; Behold, I will punish the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> and his land, as I have punished the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And I will bring <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> again to his <a href="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</a>, and he shall feed on <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#006">Carmel</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd046.htm#003">Bashan</a>, and his soul shall be satisfied upon <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#009">Gilead</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the iniquity of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and they shall not be found: for I will <a href="../ebd/ebd285.htm#001">pardon</a> them whom I reserve.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Go up against the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#002">Merathaim</a>, even against it, and against the inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd288.htm#004">Pekod</a>: waste and utterly destroy after them, saith the LORD, and do according to all that I have commanded thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> A sound of battle is in the land, and of great <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> How is the <a href="../ebd/ebd161.htm#000">hammer</a> of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> become a desolation among the nations!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> I have laid a <a href="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</a> for thee, and thou art also taken, O <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striven against the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> The LORD hath opened his <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#008">armoury</a>, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation: for this is the work of the Lord GOD of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Come against her from the utmost border, open her storehouses: cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly: let nothing of her be left.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, to declare in <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a> the vengeance of the LORD our God, the vengeance of his <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Call together the archers against <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>: all ye that bend the <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a> against it round about; let none thereof escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do unto her: for she hath been proud against the LORD, against the Holy One of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets, and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Behold, I am against thee, O thou most proud, saith the Lord GOD of hosts: for thy day is come, the time that I will visit thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all round about him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> and the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> were oppressed together: and all that took them captives held them <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a>; they refused to let them go.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> Their <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#008">Redeemer</a> is strong; the LORD of hosts is his name: he shall throughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the land, and disquiet the inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> A <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> is upon the Chaldeans, saith the LORD, and upon the inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, and upon her princes, and upon her <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> A <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> is upon the liars; and they shall dote: a <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> is upon her mighty men; and they shall be dismayed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> A <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> is upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her; and they shall become as women: a <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> is upon her treasures; and they shall be robbed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> A <a href="../ebd/ebd108.htm#005">drought</a> is upon her waters; and they shall be dried up: for it is the land of graven images, and they are mad upon their idols.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> Therefore the wild beasts of the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#000">desert</a> with the wild beasts of the islands shall dwell there, and the owls shall dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> As God overthrew <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#004">Sodom</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#007">Gomorrah</a> and the neighbour cities thereof, saith the LORD; so shall no man abide there, neither shall any son of man dwell therein.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> Behold, a people shall come from the north, and a great nation, and many kings shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> They shall hold the <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a> and the lance: they are cruel, and will not shew <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a>: their voice shall roar like the sea, and they shall ride upon horses, every one put in array, like a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> hath heard the report of them, and his hands waxed feeble: anguish took hold of him, and pangs as of a woman in travail.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#001">swelling</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a> unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</a> of the strong: but I will make them suddenly run away from her: and who is a <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> man, that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that <a href="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</a> that will stand before me?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> Therefore hear ye the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their <a href="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</a> desolate with them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="046">46</a> At the noise of the taking of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> the earth is moved, and the cry is heard among the nations.<br>
