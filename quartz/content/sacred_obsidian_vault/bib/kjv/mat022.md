 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Matthew Chapter 22</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> The kingdom of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> is like unto a certain <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, which made a marriage for his son,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the marriage.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> But when the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And when the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Then said the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> For many are called, but few are <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Then went the <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a>, and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And they sent out unto him their disciples with the <a href="../ebd/ebd176.htm#005">Herodians</a>, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not the person of men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#006">tribute</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#002">Caesar</a>, or not?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Shew me the <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#006">tribute</a> money. And they brought unto him a <a href="../ebd/ebd289.htm#002">penny</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#002">Caesar</a> the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> The same day came to him the <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#003">Sadducees</a>, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Saying, Master, <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Now there were with us <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And last of all the woman died also.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a>?  for they all had her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> I am the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, and the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a>, and the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>?  God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> But when the <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a> had heard that he had put the <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#003">Sadducees</a> to silence, they were gathered together.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> Then one of them, which was a <a href="../ebd/ebd225.htm#002">lawyer</a>, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> Master, which is the great commandment in the law?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> This is the first and great commandment.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> While the <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a> were gathered together, <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> asked them,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> Saying, What think ye of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>? whose son is he? They say unto him, The son of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> He saith unto them, How then doth <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> call him Lord, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#009">footstool</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> If <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> then call him Lord, how is he his son?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="046">46</a> And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions.<br>
