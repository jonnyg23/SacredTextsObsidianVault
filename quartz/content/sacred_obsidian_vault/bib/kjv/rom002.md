 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Romans Chapter 2</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Or despisest thou the riches of his <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</a> and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</a> of God leadeth thee to <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#008">repentance</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and <a href="../ebd/ebd312.htm#002">revelation</a> of the righteous judgment of God;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Who will render to every man according to his deeds:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> and honour and <a href="../ebd/ebd187.htm#009">immortality</a>, eternal life:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#005">Tribulation</a> and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#004">Jew</a> first, and also of the Gentile;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#004">Jew</a> first, and also to the Gentile:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> For there is no respect of persons with God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> (For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> For when the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#006">conscience</a> also bearing <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a>, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> In the day when God shall <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> the secrets of men by <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> according to my <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Behold, thou art called a <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#004">Jew</a>, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a>, a light of them which are in <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Thou that sayest a man should not commit <a href="../ebd/ebd010.htm#009">adultery</a>, dost thou commit <a href="../ebd/ebd010.htm#009">adultery</a>? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> For the name of God is blasphemed among the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a> through you, as it is written.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> For <a href="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</a> verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy <a href="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</a> is made uncircumcision.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for <a href="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> thee, who by the letter and <a href="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</a> dost transgress the law?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> For he is not a <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#004">Jew</a>, which is one outwardly; neither is that <a href="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</a>, which is outward in the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> But he is a <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#004">Jew</a>, which is one inwardly; and <a href="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</a> is that of the heart, in the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.<br>
