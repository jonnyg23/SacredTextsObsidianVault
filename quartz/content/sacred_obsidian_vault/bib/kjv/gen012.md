 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Genesis Chapter 12</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now the LORD had said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#004">Abram</a>, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a> thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And I will <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a> them that <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a> thee, and <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</a> him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#004">Abram</a> departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#004">Abram</a> was seventy and five years old when he departed out of <a href="../ebd/ebd163.htm#007">Haran</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#004">Abram</a> took <a href="../ebd/ebd322.htm#004">Sarai</a> his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in <a href="../ebd/ebd163.htm#007">Haran</a>; and they went forth to go into the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</a>; and into the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</a> they came.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#004">Abram</a> passed through the land unto the place of <a href="../ebd/ebd342.htm#007">Sichem</a>, unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#006">Moreh</a>. And the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#008">Canaanite</a> was then in the land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And the LORD appeared unto <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#004">Abram</a>, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> unto the LORD, who appeared unto him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</a>, and pitched his <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a>, having <a href="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</a> on the west, and Hai on the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a>: and there he builded an <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#004">Abram</a> journeyed, going on still toward the south.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And there was a <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a> in the land: and <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#004">Abram</a> went down into <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> to sojourn there; for the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a> was grievous in the land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, that he said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd322.htm#004">Sarai</a> his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And it came to pass, that, when <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#004">Abram</a> was come into <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> The princes also of <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> saw her, and commended her before <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And he entreated <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#004">Abram</a> well for her sake: and he had <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And the LORD plagued <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> and his house with great plagues because of <a href="../ebd/ebd322.htm#004">Sarai</a> Abram's wife.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> called <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#004">Abram</a> and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.<br>
