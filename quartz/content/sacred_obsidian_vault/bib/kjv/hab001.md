 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Habakkuk Chapter 1</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</a> which <a href="../ebd/ebd156.htm#004">Habakkuk</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> did see.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! even cry out unto thee of violence, and thou wilt not save!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause me to behold grievance? for spoiling and violence are before me: and there are that raise up strife and contention.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Behold ye among the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a>, and regard, and wonder marvelously: for I will work a work in your days which ye will not believe, though it be told you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that <a href="../ebd/ebd059.htm#009">bitter</a> and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwellingplaces that are not their's.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> They are terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#004">fly</a> as the <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#003">eagle</a> that hasteth to eat.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up as the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a> wind, and they shall gather the <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a> as the sand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a>, and take it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Then shall his mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend, imputing this his power unto his god.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Art thou not from <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a>, O LORD my God, mine Holy One? we shall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their <a href="../ebd/ebd271.htm#002">net</a>, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Therefore they <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> unto their <a href="../ebd/ebd271.htm#002">net</a>, and burn <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a> unto their drag; because by them their portion is <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</a>, and their meat plenteous.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Shall they therefore empty their <a href="../ebd/ebd271.htm#002">net</a>, and not spare continually to slay the nations?<br>
