 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 11</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Moreover the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> lifted me up, and brought me unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> of the LORD's house, which looketh eastward: and behold at the door of the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> five and twenty men; among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd038.htm#003">Azur</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd288.htm#006">Pelatiah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#003">Benaiah</a>, princes of the people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Then said he unto me, Son of man, these are the men that devise mischief, and give wicked counsel in this city:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Which say, It is not near; let us build houses: this city is the caldron, and we be the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> of the LORD fell upon me, and said unto me, Speak; Thus saith the LORD; Thus have ye said, O house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: for I know the things that come into your mind, every one of them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it, they are the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, and this city is the caldron: but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Ye have feared the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>; and I will bring a <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> upon you, saith the Lord GOD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And I will bring you out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Ye shall fall by the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>; I will <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> you in the border of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> This city shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> in the midst thereof; but I will <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> you in the border of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And ye shall know that I am the LORD: for ye have not walked in my statutes, neither executed my judgments, but have done after the manners of the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a> that are round about you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that <a href="../ebd/ebd288.htm#006">Pelatiah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#003">Benaiah</a> died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Son of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> wholly, are they unto whom the inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> have said, Get you far from the LORD: unto us is this land given in possession.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Although I have cast them far off among the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a>, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</a> in the countries where they shall come.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even gather you from the people, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, and will give them an heart of <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> That they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> But as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord GOD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Then did the cherubims lift up their wings, and the wheels beside them; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> was over them above.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of the LORD went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a> side of the city.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Afterwards the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> took me up, and brought me in a <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a> by the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> of God into <a href="../ebd/ebd076.htm#000">Chaldea</a>, to them of the <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a>. So the <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a> that I had seen went up from me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Then I spake unto them of the <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a> all the things that the LORD had shewed me.<br>
