 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 2</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> determined to build an house for the name of the LORD, and an house for his kingdom.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> sent to Huram the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd374.htm#001">Tyre</a>, saying, As thou didst deal with <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> my father, and didst send him cedars to build him an house to dwell therein, even so deal with me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Behold, I build an house to the name of the LORD my God, to dedicate it to him, and to burn before him sweet <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a>, and for the continual <a href="../ebd/ebd336.htm#008">shewbread</a>, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts of the LORD our God. This is an ordinance for ever to <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And the house which I build is great: for great is our God above all gods.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> But who is able to build him an house, seeing the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> of heavens cannot contain him? who am I then, that I should build him an house, save only to burn <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> before him?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Send me now therefore a man cunning to work in <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, and in <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, and in <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a>, and in <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a>, and in purple, and <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#007">crimson</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#003">blue</a>, and that can skill to <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</a> with the cunning men that are with me in <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> and in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, whom <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> my father did provide.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Send me also <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</a> trees, <a href="../ebd/ebd133.htm#005">fir</a> trees, and <a href="../ebd/ebd017.htm#002">algum</a> trees, out of <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</a>: for I know that thy servants can skill to cut timber in <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</a>; and, behold, my servants shall be with thy servants,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Even to prepare me timber in abundance: for the house which I am about to build shall be wonderful great.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#000">wheat</a>, and twenty thousand measures of <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#003">barley</a>, and twenty thousand <a href="../ebd/ebd047.htm#004">baths</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>, and twenty thousand <a href="../ebd/ebd047.htm#004">baths</a> of oil.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Then Huram the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd374.htm#001">Tyre</a> answered in <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#005">writing</a>, which he sent to <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a>, Because the LORD hath loved his people, he hath made thee <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> over them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Huram said moreover, Blessed be the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, that made <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> and earth, who hath given to <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> a <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> son, endued with prudence and understanding, that might build an house for the LORD, and an house for his kingdom.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding, of Huram my father's,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> The son of a woman of the daughters of <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#009">Dan</a>, and his father was a man of <a href="../ebd/ebd374.htm#001">Tyre</a>, skilful to work in <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, and in <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, in <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a>, in <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a>, in <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a>, and in timber, in purple, in <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#003">blue</a>, and in fine <a href="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</a>, and in <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#007">crimson</a>; also to <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</a> any manner of <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#000">graving</a>, and to find out every device which shall be put to him, with thy cunning men, and with the cunning men of my lord <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> thy father.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Now therefore the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#000">wheat</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#003">barley</a>, the oil, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his servants:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And we will cut <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a> out of <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</a>, as much as thou shalt need: and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#002">Joppa</a>; and thou shalt carry it up to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> numbered all the strangers that were in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, after the numbering wherewith <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> his father had numbered them; and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And he set threescore and ten thousand of them to be bearers of burdens, and fourscore thousand to be hewers in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people a work.<br>
