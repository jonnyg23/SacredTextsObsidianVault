 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Acts Chapter 21</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and had launched, we came with a straight course unto <a href="../ebd/ebd089.htm#005">Coos</a>, and the day following unto <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#001">Rhodes</a>, and from thence unto <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#006">Patara</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And finding a ship sailing over unto <a href="../ebd/ebd293.htm#002">Phenicia</a>, we went aboard, and set forth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Now when we had discovered <a href="../ebd/ebd095.htm#003">Cyprus</a>, we left it on the left hand, and sailed into <a href="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</a>, and landed at <a href="../ebd/ebd374.htm#001">Tyre</a>: for there the ship was to unlade her <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And finding disciples, we tarried there <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> days: who said to <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> through the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a>, that he should not go up to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, till we were out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship; and they returned home again.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And when we had finished our course from <a href="../ebd/ebd374.htm#001">Tyre</a>, we came to <a href="../ebd/ebd301.htm#007">Ptolemais</a>, and saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And the next day we that were of Paul's company departed, and came unto <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#003">Caesarea</a>: and we entered into the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#004">evangelist</a>, which was one of the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a>; and abode with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judaea a certain <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>, named <a href="../ebd/ebd011.htm#007">Agabus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And when he was come unto us, he took Paul's <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#005">girdle</a>, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a>, So shall the Jews at <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> bind the man that owneth this <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#005">girdle</a>, and shall deliver him into the hands of the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place, besought him not to go up to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine heart?  for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> for the name of the Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> There went with us also certain of the disciples of <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#003">Caesarea</a>, and brought with them one <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#004">Mnason</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd095.htm#003">Cyprus</a>, an old <a href="../ebd/ebd104.htm#003">disciple</a>, with whom we should <a href="../ebd/ebd231.htm#002">lodge</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And when we were come to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, the brethren received us gladly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And the day following <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> went in with us unto <a href="../ebd/ebd196.htm#007">James</a>; and all the elders were present.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a> by his ministry.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</a> of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a> to forsake <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which have a vow on them;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> As touching the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a> which believe, we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols, and from <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>, and from strangled, and from <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>, to signify the accomplishment of the days of <a href="../ebd/ebd302.htm#007">purification</a>, until that an <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> should be offered for every one of them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And when the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> days were almost ended, the Jews which were of <a href="../ebd/ebd034.htm#008">Asia</a>, when they saw him in the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Crying out, Men of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, help: This is the man, that teacheth all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>, and hath polluted this holy place.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> (For they had seen before with him in the city <a href="../ebd/ebd373.htm#000">Trophimus</a> an Ephesian, whom they supposed that <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> had brought into the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>.)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and they took <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a>, and drew him out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>: and forthwith the <a href="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</a> were shut.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief captain of the band, that all <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> was in an uproar.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating of <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the <a href="../ebd/ebd073.htm#008">castle</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> And as <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> was to be led into the <a href="../ebd/ebd073.htm#008">castle</a>, he said unto the chief captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#004">Greek</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out into the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> four thousand men that were murderers?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> said, I am a man which am a <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#004">Jew</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd359.htm#003">Tarsus</a>, a city in <a href="../ebd/ebd083.htm#003">Cilicia</a>, a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech thee, suffer me to speak unto the people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> And when he had given him licence, <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand unto the people. And when there was made a great silence, he spake unto them in the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#009">Hebrew</a> tongue, saying,<br>
