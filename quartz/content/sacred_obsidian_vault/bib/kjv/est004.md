 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Esther Chapter 4</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> When <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</a> perceived all that was done, <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</a> his clothes, and put on <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#001">sackcloth</a> with <a href="../ebd/ebd034.htm#000">ashes</a>, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a <a href="../ebd/ebd059.htm#009">bitter</a> cry;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And came even before the king's <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a>: for none might enter into the king's <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> clothed with <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#001">sackcloth</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And in every province, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#001">sackcloth</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd034.htm#000">ashes</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> So Esther's maids and her chamberlains came and told it her. Then was the <a href="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</a> exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</a>, and to take away his <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#001">sackcloth</a> from him: but he received it not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Then called <a href="../ebd/ebd125.htm#006">Esther</a> for <a href="../ebd/ebd167.htm#001">Hatach</a>, one of the king's chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a commandment to <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</a>, to know what it was, and why it was.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd167.htm#001">Hatach</a> went forth to <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</a> unto the street of the city, which was before the king's <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</a> told him of all that had happened unto him, and of the sum of the money that <a href="../ebd/ebd160.htm#004">Haman</a> had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Also he gave him the copy of the <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#005">writing</a> of the decree that was given at <a href="../ebd/ebd342.htm#003">Shushan</a> to destroy them, to shew it unto <a href="../ebd/ebd125.htm#006">Esther</a>, and to declare it unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him for her people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd167.htm#001">Hatach</a> came and told <a href="../ebd/ebd125.htm#006">Esther</a> the words of <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Again <a href="../ebd/ebd125.htm#006">Esther</a> spake unto <a href="../ebd/ebd167.htm#001">Hatach</a>, and gave him commandment unto <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or women, shall come unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law of his to put him to death, except such to whom the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> shall hold out the golden <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#006">sceptre</a>, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> these thirty days.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And they told to <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</a> Esther's words.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</a> commanded to answer <a href="../ebd/ebd125.htm#006">Esther</a>, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house, more than all the Jews.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd125.htm#006">Esther</a> bade them return <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</a> this answer,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in <a href="../ebd/ebd342.htm#003">Shushan</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a> ye for me, and neither eat nor <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a> likewise; and so will I go in unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</a> went his way, and did according to all that <a href="../ebd/ebd125.htm#006">Esther</a> had commanded him.<br>
