 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Lamentations Chapter 4</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> How is the <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> become dim! how is the most fine <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> changed! the stones of the <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</a> are poured out in the top of every street.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> The precious sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a>, comparable to fine <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones: the daughter of my people is become cruel, like the ostriches in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst: the young children ask <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>, and no man breaketh it unto them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: they that were brought up in <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#005">scarlet</a> embrace dunghills.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> For the <a href="../ebd/ebd302.htm#005">punishment</a> of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the <a href="../ebd/ebd302.htm#005">punishment</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#004">Sodom</a>, that was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands stayed on her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Her Nazarites were purer than <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#000">snow</a>, they were whiter than <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#000">milk</a>, they were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing was of <a href="../ebd/ebd322.htm#002">sapphire</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Their visage is blacker than a <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#003">coal</a>; they are not known in the streets: their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> They that be slain with the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> are better than they that be slain with hunger: for these pine away, stricken through for want of the fruits of the field.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children: they were their meat in the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a> of the daughter of my people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> The LORD hath accomplished his <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</a>; he hath poured out his fierce <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>, and hath kindled a fire in <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a>, and it hath devoured the foundations thereof.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world, would not have believed that the <a href="../ebd/ebd011.htm#001">adversary</a> and the enemy should have entered into the gates of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> For the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests, that have shed the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of the just in the midst of her,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> They have wandered as <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a> men in the streets, they have polluted themselves with <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>, so that men could not touch their garments.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> They cried unto them, Depart ye; it is unclean; depart, depart, touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they said among the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a>, They shall no more sojourn there.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> of the LORD hath divided them; he will no more regard them: they respected not the persons of the priests, they favoured not the elders.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>: they pursued us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD, was taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under his <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</a> we shall live among the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</a>, that dwellest in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd375.htm#007">Uz</a>; the <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</a> also shall pass through unto thee: thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd302.htm#005">punishment</a> of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a>; he will no more carry thee away into <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a>: he will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</a>; he will discover thy sins.<br>
