 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Corinthians Chapter 4</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, and stewards of the mysteries of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> not mine own self.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Therefore <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to <a href="../ebd/ebd026.htm#006">Apollos</a> for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>, as if thou hadst not received it?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> We are fools for Christ's sake, but ye are <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</a>, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a>; being persecuted, we suffer it:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring of all things unto this day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> For though ye have ten thousand instructers in <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, yet have ye not many fathers: for in <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> I have begotten you through the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> For this cause have I sent unto you <a href="../ebd/ebd367.htm#001">Timotheus</a>, who is my beloved son, and <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a> in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, as I teach every where in every church.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and in the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd246.htm#003">meekness</a>?<br>
