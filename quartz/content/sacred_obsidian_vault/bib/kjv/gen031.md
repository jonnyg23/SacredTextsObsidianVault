 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Genesis Chapter 31</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> hath taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's hath he gotten all this <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> beheld the countenance of <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</a>, and, behold, it was not toward him as before.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> sent and called <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#004">Rachel</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd225.htm#006">Leah</a> to the field unto his flock,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And your father hath deceived me, and changed my <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#004">wages</a> ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#004">wages</a>; then all the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a> bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be thy hire; then bare all the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a> ringstraked.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Thus God hath taken away the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a> of your father, and given them to me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And it came to pass at the time that the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a> conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a>, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a> were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of God spake unto me in a <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a>, saying, <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>: And I said, Here am I.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which leap upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a> are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I have seen all that <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</a> doeth unto thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> I am the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</a>, where thou anointedst the <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#007">pillar</a>, and where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#004">Rachel</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd225.htm#006">Leah</a> answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured also our money.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is ours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And he carried away all his <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a>, and all his goods which he had gotten, the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a> of his getting, which he had gotten in Padanaram, for to go to <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a> his father in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</a> went to shear his <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#004">Rachel</a> had stolen the images that were her father's.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> stole away unawares to <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</a> the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face toward the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#009">Gilead</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And it was told <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</a> on the third day that <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> was fled.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> days' <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</a>; and they overtook him in the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#009">Gilead</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And God came to <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</a> the Syrian in a <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a> by night, and said unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> either good or bad.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</a> overtook <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>. Now <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> had pitched his <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</a> with his brethren pitched in the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#009">Gilead</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</a> said to <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with <a href="../ebd/ebd348.htm#002">songs</a>, with <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#009">tabret</a>, and with <a href="../ebd/ebd165.htm#001">harp</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And hast not suffered me to <a href="../ebd/ebd221.htm#000">kiss</a> my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> either good or bad.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> answered and said to <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</a>, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> knew not that <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#004">Rachel</a> had stolen them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</a> went into Jacob's <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a>, and into Leah's <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a>, and into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then went he out of Leah's <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a>, and entered into Rachel's <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> Now <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#004">Rachel</a> had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them. And <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</a> searched all the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a>, but found them not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#008">custom</a> of women is upon me. And he searched but found not the images.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> was wroth, and chode with <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> answered and said to <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</a>, What is my trespass? what is my <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> betwixt us both.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> Thus I was; in the day the <a href="../ebd/ebd108.htm#005">drought</a> consumed me, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd138.htm#009">frost</a> by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a>: and thou hast changed my <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#004">wages</a> ten times.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> Except the God of my father, the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, and the fear of <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a>, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</a> answered and said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a> are my <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a>, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> Now therefore come thou, let us make a <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a>, I and thou; and let it be for a <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> between me and thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> took a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a>, and set it up for a <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#007">pillar</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="046">46</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</a>: and they did eat there upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="047">47</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</a> called it Jegarsahadutha: but <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> called it <a href="../ebd/ebd142.htm#001">Galeed</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="048">48</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</a> said, This <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</a> is a <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called <a href="../ebd/ebd142.htm#001">Galeed</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="049">49</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#000">Mizpah</a>; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="050">50</a> If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> betwixt me and thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="051">51</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</a> said to <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, Behold this <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</a>, and behold this <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#007">pillar</a>, which I have cast betwixt me and thee:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="052">52</a> This <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</a> be <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a>, and this <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#007">pillar</a> be <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a>, that I will not pass over this <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</a> to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</a> and this <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#007">pillar</a> unto me, for harm.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="053">53</a> The God of <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, and the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd265.htm#006">Nahor</a>, the God of their father, <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> betwixt us. And <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> sware by the fear of his father <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="054">54</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> offered <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a>, and called his brethren to eat <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>: and they did eat <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>, and tarried all night in the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="055">55</a> And early in the morning <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</a> rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</a> departed, and returned unto his place.<br>
