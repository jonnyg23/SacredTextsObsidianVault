 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 38</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd335.htm#005">Shephatiah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd243.htm#007">Mattan</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd144.htm#009">Gedaliah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#002">Pashur</a>, and Jucal the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd334.htm#001">Shelemiah</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#002">Pashur</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd239.htm#001">Malchiah</a>, heard the words that <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> had spoken unto all the people, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Thus saith the LORD, He that remaineth in this city shall die by the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, by the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a>, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live; for he shall have his life for a prey, and shall live.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Thus saith the LORD, This city shall surely be given into the hand of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of Babylon's army, which shall take it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Therefore the princes said unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, We beseech thee, let this man be put to death: for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words unto them: for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people, but the hurt.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said, Behold, he is in your hand: for the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> is not he that can do any thing against you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Then took they <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a>, and cast him into the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#006">dungeon</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd239.htm#001">Malchiah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd160.htm#009">Hammelech</a>, that was in the court of the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a>: and they let down <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> with cords. And in the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#006">dungeon</a> there was no water, but mire: so <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> sunk in the mire.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was in the king's house, heard that they had put <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#006">dungeon</a>; the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> then <a href="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Ebedmelech went forth out of the king's house, and spake to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> My lord the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, these men have done evil in all that they have done to <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>, whom they have cast into the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#006">dungeon</a>; and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is: for there is no more <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> in the city.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Then the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty men with thee, and take up <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#006">dungeon</a>, before he die.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> under the <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#000">treasury</a>, and took thence old cast clouts and old rotten rags, and let them down by cords into the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#006">dungeon</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a>, Put now these old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the cords. And <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> did so.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> So they drew up <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> with cords, and took him up out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#006">dungeon</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> remained in the court of the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> sent, and took <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> unto him into the third entry that is in the house of the LORD: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a>, I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing from me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</a>, If I declare it unto thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, wilt thou not hearken unto me?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> sware secretly unto <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a>, saying, As the LORD liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put thee to death, neither will I give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</a>, Thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; If thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of Babylon's princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thine house:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> But if thou wilt not go forth to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of Babylon's princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a>, I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> said, They shall not deliver thee. Obey, I beseech thee, the voice of the LORD, which I speak unto thee: so it shall be well unto thee, and thy soul shall live.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that the LORD hath shewed me:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And, behold, all the women that are left in the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of Judah's house shall be brought forth to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of Babylon's princes, and those women shall say, Thy friends have set thee on, and have prevailed against thee: thy feet are sunk in the mire, and they are turned away back.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans: and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>: and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a>, Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come unto thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said unto thee:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication before the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan's house, to die there.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Then came all the princes unto <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a>, and asked him: and he told them according to all these words that the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> abode in the court of the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a> until the day that <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> was taken: and he was there when <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> was taken.<br>
