 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: John Chapter 16</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the <a href="../ebd/ebd087.htm#001">Comforter</a> will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And when he is come, he will reprove the world of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>, and of <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>, and of judgment:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>, because they believe not on me;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Of <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Of judgment, because the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</a> of this world is judged.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Howbeit when he, the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> He shall <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#005">glorify</a> me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? we cannot tell what he saith.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Now <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no <a href="../ebd/ebd301.htm#002">proverb</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answered them, Do ye now believe?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#005">tribulation</a>: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.<br>
