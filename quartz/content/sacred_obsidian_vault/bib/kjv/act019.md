 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Acts Chapter 19</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And it came to pass, that, while <a href="../ebd/ebd026.htm#006">Apollos</a> was at <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#002">Corinth</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> having passed through the upper coasts came to <a href="../ebd/ebd122.htm#007">Ephesus</a>: and finding certain disciples,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a> since ye believed?  And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John's baptism.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a>, John verily baptized with the baptism of <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#008">repentance</a>, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> had laid his hands upon them, the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a> came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And all the men were about twelve.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And he went into the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</a>, and spake boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one <a href="../ebd/ebd374.htm#000">Tyrannus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelt in <a href="../ebd/ebd034.htm#008">Asia</a> heard the word of the Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, both Jews and Greeks.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And God wrought special miracles by the hands of <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Then certain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#006">vagabond</a> Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the LORD <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, saying, We adjure you by <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> whom <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> preacheth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And there were <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> sons of one <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#007">Sceva</a>, a <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#004">Jew</a>, and chief of the priests, which did so.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And the evil <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> answered and said, <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> I know, and <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> I know; but who are ye?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And the man in whom the evil <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</a> and wounded.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at <a href="../ebd/ebd122.htm#007">Ephesus</a>; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> was magnified.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> After these things were ended, <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> purposed in the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>, when he had passed through <a href="../ebd/ebd235.htm#003">Macedonia</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd006.htm#004">Achaia</a>, to go to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, saying, After I have been there, I must also see <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#007">Rome</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> So he sent into <a href="../ebd/ebd235.htm#003">Macedonia</a> two of them that ministered unto him, <a href="../ebd/ebd367.htm#001">Timotheus</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#001">Erastus</a>; but he himself stayed in <a href="../ebd/ebd034.htm#008">Asia</a> for a season.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> For a certain man named <a href="../ebd/ebd101.htm#005">Demetrius</a>, a silversmith, which made <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> shrines for <a href="../ebd/ebd103.htm#002">Diana</a>, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at <a href="../ebd/ebd122.htm#007">Ephesus</a>, but almost throughout all <a href="../ebd/ebd034.htm#008">Asia</a>, this <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> of the great goddess <a href="../ebd/ebd103.htm#002">Diana</a> should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all <a href="../ebd/ebd034.htm#008">Asia</a> and the world worshippeth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is <a href="../ebd/ebd103.htm#002">Diana</a> of the Ephesians.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#003">Gaius</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd030.htm#008">Aristarchus</a>, men of <a href="../ebd/ebd235.htm#003">Macedonia</a>, Paul's companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the <a href="../ebd/ebd363.htm#004">theatre</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And certain of the chief of <a href="../ebd/ebd034.htm#008">Asia</a>, which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the <a href="../ebd/ebd363.htm#004">theatre</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused: and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And they drew <a href="../ebd/ebd016.htm#009">Alexander</a> out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And <a href="../ebd/ebd016.htm#009">Alexander</a> beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defence unto the people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> But when they knew that he was a <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#004">Jew</a>, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is <a href="../ebd/ebd103.htm#002">Diana</a> of the Ephesians.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye men of <a href="../ebd/ebd122.htm#007">Ephesus</a>, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#003">worshipper</a> of the great goddess <a href="../ebd/ebd103.htm#002">Diana</a>, and of the image which fell down from <a href="../ebd/ebd214.htm#006">Jupiter</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> Wherefore if <a href="../ebd/ebd101.htm#005">Demetrius</a>, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them implead one another.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> For we are in danger to be called in question for this day's uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.<br>
