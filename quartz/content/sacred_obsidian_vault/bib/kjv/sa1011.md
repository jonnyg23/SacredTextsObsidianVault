 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 11</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd265.htm#003">Nahash</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#003">Ammonite</a> came up, and encamped against Jabeshgilead: and all the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd193.htm#007">Jabesh</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd265.htm#003">Nahash</a>, Make a <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> with us, and we will serve thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd265.htm#003">Nahash</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#003">Ammonite</a> answered them, On this condition will I make a <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> with you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes, and lay it for a reproach upon all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And the elders of <a href="../ebd/ebd193.htm#007">Jabesh</a> said unto him, Give us <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> days' respite, that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: and then, if there be no man to save us, we will come out to thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Then came the messengers to <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#008">Gibeah</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, and told the tidings in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voices, and wept.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And, behold, <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> came after the <a href="../ebd/ebd174.htm#009">herd</a> out of the field; and <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> said, What aileth the people that they weep? And they told him the tidings of the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd193.htm#007">Jabesh</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> of God came upon <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> when he heard those tidings, and his <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> was kindled greatly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And he took a <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</a> of oxen, and hewed them in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a>, and sent them throughout all the coasts of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> by the hands of messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> and after <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a>, so shall it be done unto his oxen. And the fear of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out with one consent.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And when he numbered them in <a href="../ebd/ebd058.htm#000">Bezek</a>, the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> were three hundred thousand, and the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> thirty thousand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say unto the men of Jabeshgilead, To morrow, by that time the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> be hot, ye shall have help. And the messengers came and shewed it to the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd193.htm#007">Jabesh</a>; and they were glad.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Therefore the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd193.htm#007">Jabesh</a> said, To morrow we will come out unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And it was so on the morrow, that <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> in the morning watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came to pass, that they which remained were scattered, so that two of them were not left together.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And the people said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a>, Who is he that said, Shall <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> said, There shall not a man be put to death this day: for to day the LORD hath wrought <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> to the people, Come, and let us go to <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#001">Gilgal</a>, and renew the kingdom there.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And all the people went to <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#001">Gilgal</a>; and there they made <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> before the LORD in <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#001">Gilgal</a>; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD; and there <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> and all the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> rejoiced greatly.<br>
