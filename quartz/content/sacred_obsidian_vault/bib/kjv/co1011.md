 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Corinthians Chapter 11</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> But I would have you know, that the head of every man is <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> is God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of God: but the woman is the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of the man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> For the man is not of the woman: but the woman of the man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">Judge</a> in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> But if a woman have long hair, it is a <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#008">custom</a>, neither the churches of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#004">supper</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> For in <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#006">eating</a> every one taketh before other his own <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#004">supper</a>: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> What? have ye not houses to eat and to <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> the same night in which he was betrayed took <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> After the same manner also he took the <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</a>, when he had supped, saying, This <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</a> is the new <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#007">testament</a> in my <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>: this do ye, as oft as ye <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> it, in remembrance of me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> For as often as ye eat this <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> this <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</a>, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Wherefore whosoever shall eat this <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> this <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</a> of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of the Lord.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> of that <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#008">damnation</a> to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> For if we would <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> ourselves, we should not be judged.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.<br>
