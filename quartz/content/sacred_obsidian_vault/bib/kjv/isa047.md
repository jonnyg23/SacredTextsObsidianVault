 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 47</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Come down, and sit in the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a>, O <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#009">virgin</a> daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, sit on the ground: there is no <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a>, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Take the millstones, and <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#006">grind</a> meal: uncover thy locks, make bare the leg, uncover the thigh, pass over the rivers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be seen: I will take vengeance, and I will not meet thee as a man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> As for our <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#008">redeemer</a>, the LORD of hosts is his name, the Holy One of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Sit thou silent, and get thee into <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called, The lady of kingdoms.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> I was wroth with my people, I have polluted mine inheritance, and given them into thine hand: thou didst shew them no <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a>; upon the ancient hast thou very heavily laid thy <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever: so that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart, neither didst remember the latter end of it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Therefore hear now this, thou that art given to pleasures, that dwellest carelessly, that sayest in thine heart, I am, and none else beside me; I shall not sit as a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> But these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood: they shall come upon thee in their <a href="../ebd/ebd290.htm#001">perfection</a> for the multitude of thy sorceries, and for the great abundance of thine <a href="../ebd/ebd120.htm#004">enchantments</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness: thou hast said, None seeth me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted thee; and thou hast said in thine heart, I am, and none else beside me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know from whence it riseth: and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou shalt not be able to put it off: and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly, which thou shalt not know.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Stand now with thine <a href="../ebd/ebd120.htm#004">enchantments</a>, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth; if so be thou shalt be able to profit, if so be thou mayest prevail.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the astrologers, the <a href="../ebd/ebd350.htm#007">stargazers</a>, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: there shall not be a <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#003">coal</a> to warm at, nor fire to sit before it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured, even thy merchants, from thy youth: they shall wander every one to his quarter; none shall save thee.<br>
