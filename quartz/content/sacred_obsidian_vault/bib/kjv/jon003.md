 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Jonah Chapter 3</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And the word of the LORD came unto <a href="../ebd/ebd210.htm#007">Jonah</a> the second time, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Arise, go unto <a href="../ebd/ebd273.htm#006">Nineveh</a>, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd210.htm#007">Jonah</a> arose, and went unto <a href="../ebd/ebd273.htm#006">Nineveh</a>, according to the word of the LORD. Now <a href="../ebd/ebd273.htm#006">Nineveh</a> was an exceeding great city of three days' <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd210.htm#007">Jonah</a> began to enter into the city a day's <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</a>, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and <a href="../ebd/ebd273.htm#006">Nineveh</a> shall be overthrown.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> So the people of <a href="../ebd/ebd273.htm#006">Nineveh</a> believed God, and proclaimed a <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a>, and put on <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#001">sackcloth</a>, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> For word came unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd273.htm#006">Nineveh</a>, and he arose from his <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a>, and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#001">sackcloth</a>, and sat in <a href="../ebd/ebd034.htm#000">ashes</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through <a href="../ebd/ebd273.htm#006">Nineveh</a> by the decree of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd174.htm#009">herd</a> nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> water:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> But let man and <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> be covered with <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#001">sackcloth</a>, and cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>, that we perish not?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them; and he did it not.<br>
