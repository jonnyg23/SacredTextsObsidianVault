 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 2</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</a> came also among them to present himself before the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</a>, From whence comest thou? And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</a> answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</a>, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a> his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</a> answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, and he will <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</a> thee to thy face.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</a>, Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> So went <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</a> forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And he took him a <a href="../ebd/ebd299.htm#004">potsherd</a> to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the <a href="../ebd/ebd034.htm#000">ashes</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity?  <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</a> God, and die.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> with his lips.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#005">Eliphaz</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#002">Temanite</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd058.htm#006">Bildad</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd341.htm#008">Shuhite</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd396.htm#000">Zophar</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd264.htm#000">Naamathite</a>: for they had made an appointment together to come to <a href="../ebd/ebd261.htm#004">mourn</a> with him and to comfort him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</a> every one his <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#009">mantle</a>, and sprinkled <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a> upon their heads toward <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> So they sat down with him upon the ground <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> days and <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great.<br>
