 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Matthew Chapter 25</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then shall the kingdom of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And five of them were <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a>, and five were foolish.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> But the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> took oil in their vessels with their lamps.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And the foolish said unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a>, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> But the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> For the kingdom of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a> servant: thou hast been <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a> over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> His lord said unto him, Well done, good and <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a> servant; thou hast been <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a> over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Then he which had received the one <a href="../ebd/ebd357.htm#009">talent</a> came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And I was afraid, and went and hid thy <a href="../ebd/ebd357.htm#009">talent</a> in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with <a href="../ebd/ebd375.htm#006">usury</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Take therefore the <a href="../ebd/ebd357.htm#009">talent</a> from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> When the Son of man shall come in his <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> of his <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a <a href="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</a> divideth his <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a> from the goats:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And he shall set the <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a> on his right hand, but the goats on the left.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> Then shall the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</a> say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>: I was a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a>, and ye took me in:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">Naked</a>, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a>, and ye came unto me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> When saw we thee a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a>, and took thee in? or <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</a>, and clothed thee?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> Or when saw we thee sick, or in <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a>, and came unto thee?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</a> shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> fire, prepared for the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</a> and his angels:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> I was a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a>, and ye took me not in: <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</a>, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a>, and ye visited me not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a>, or <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</a>, or sick, or in <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a>, and did not <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</a> unto thee?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="046">46</a> And these shall go away into <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd302.htm#005">punishment</a>: but the righteous into life eternal.<br>
