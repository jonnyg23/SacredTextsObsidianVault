 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 18</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh and intermeddleth with all wisdom.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> When the wicked cometh, then cometh also contempt, and with ignominy reproach.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> The words of a man's mouth are as <a href="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</a> waters, and the wellspring of wisdom as a flowing <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#006">brook</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> It is not good to accept the person of the wicked, to overthrow the righteous in judgment.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> A fool's lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for strokes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> A fool's mouth is his <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a>, and his lips are the <a href="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</a> of his soul.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> The name of the LORD is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> The rich man's wealth is his strong city, and as an high wall in his own conceit.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Before <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a> the heart of man is haughty, and before honour is <a href="../ebd/ebd184.htm#007">humility</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> He that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly and shame unto him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> who can bear?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> seeketh knowledge.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> A man's <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</a> maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> He that is first in his own cause seemeth just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the mighty.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city: and their contentions are like the bars of a <a href="../ebd/ebd073.htm#008">castle</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> A man's <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</a> shall be satisfied with the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> of his mouth; and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> thereof.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favour of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.<br>
