 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Ecclesiastes Chapter 2</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also is vanity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> I sought in mine heart to give myself unto <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> all the days of their life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> I made me <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#001">gardens</a> and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> I made me pools of water, to water therewith the <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a> that bringeth forth trees:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a> above all that were in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> before me:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> I gathered me also <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#008">peculiar</a> treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments, and that of all sorts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>: also my wisdom remained with me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was vanity and vexation of <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>, and there was no profit under the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and <a href="../ebd/ebd236.htm#002">madness</a>, and folly: for what can the man do that cometh after the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>? even that which hath been already done.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> man's eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a>? Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> For there is no remembrance of the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> man? as the fool.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation of <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a>: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And who knoweth whether he shall be a <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> man or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> under the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a>. This is also vanity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> For there is a man whose labour is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</a> up, that he may give to him that is good before God. This also is vanity and vexation of <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>.<br>
