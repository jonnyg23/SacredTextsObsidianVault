 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Luke Chapter 1</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent <a href="../ebd/ebd363.htm#008">Theophilus</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> THERE was in the days of Herod, the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of Judaea, a certain <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> named <a href="../ebd/ebd386.htm#006">Zacharias</a>, of the course of <a href="../ebd/ebd002.htm#002">Abia</a>: and his wife was of the daughters of <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a>, and her name was <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#008">Elisabeth</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And they had no child, because that <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#008">Elisabeth</a> was <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#007">barren</a>, and they both were now well stricken in years.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his course,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> According to the <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#008">custom</a> of the priest's office, his lot was to burn <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a> when he went into the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> of the Lord.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And there appeared unto him an <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the Lord standing on the right side of the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd386.htm#006">Zacharias</a> saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> But the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> said unto him, Fear not, <a href="../ebd/ebd386.htm#006">Zacharias</a>: for thy <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a> is heard; and thy wife <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#008">Elisabeth</a> shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his <a href="../ebd/ebd059.htm#002">birth</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> neither <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> nor strong <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>; and he shall be filled with the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a>, even from his mother's womb.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And many of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> shall he turn to the Lord their God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And he shall go before him in the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> and power of <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#002">Elias</a>, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd386.htm#006">Zacharias</a> said unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a>, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> answering said unto him, I am <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#006">Gabriel</a>, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And, behold, thou shalt be <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#002">dumb</a>, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And the people waited for <a href="../ebd/ebd386.htm#006">Zacharias</a>, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And after those days his wife <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#008">Elisabeth</a> conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And in the sixth month the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#006">Gabriel</a> was sent from God unto a city of <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a>, named <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#007">Nazareth</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> To a <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#009">virgin</a> espoused to a man whose name was <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>, of the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>; and the virgin's name was <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> came in unto her, and said, <a href="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">Hail</a>, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#002">salutation</a> this should be.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> said unto her, Fear not, <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</a>: for thou hast found favour with God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">JESUS</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> of his father <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And he shall reign over the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</a> unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a>, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> answered and said unto her, The Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a> shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> And, behold, thy cousin <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#008">Elisabeth</a>, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#007">barren</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> For with God nothing shall be impossible.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</a> said, Behold the <a href="../ebd/ebd162.htm#008">handmaid</a> of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> departed from her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</a> arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#006">Juda</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> And entered into the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd386.htm#006">Zacharias</a>, and saluted <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#008">Elisabeth</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> And it came to pass, that, when <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#008">Elisabeth</a> heard the <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#002">salutation</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd040.htm#009">babe</a> leaped in her womb; and <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#008">Elisabeth</a> was filled with the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> of thy womb.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#002">salutation</a> sounded in mine ears, the <a href="../ebd/ebd040.htm#009">babe</a> leaped in my womb for joy.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="046">46</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</a> said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="047">47</a> And my <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> hath rejoiced in God my <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#003">Saviour</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="048">48</a> For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="049">49</a> For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is his name.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="050">50</a> And his <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> is on them that fear him from <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="051">51</a> He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="052">52</a> He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="053">53</a> He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="054">54</a> He hath holpen his servant <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, in remembrance of his <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="055">55</a> As he spake to our fathers, to <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, and to his seed for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="056">56</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</a> abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="057">57</a> Now Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="058">58</a> And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> upon her; and they rejoiced with her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="059">59</a> And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him <a href="../ebd/ebd386.htm#006">Zacharias</a>, after the name of his father.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="060">60</a> And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="061">61</a> And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="062">62</a> And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="063">63</a> And he asked for a <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#005">writing</a> table, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="064">64</a> And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he spake, and praised God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="065">65</a> And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="066">66</a> And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="067">67</a> And his father <a href="../ebd/ebd386.htm#006">Zacharias</a> was filled with the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a>, and prophesied, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="068">68</a> Blessed be the Lord God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; for he hath visited and redeemed his people,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="069">69</a> And hath raised up an <a href="../ebd/ebd182.htm#003">horn</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a> for us in the house of his servant <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="070">70</a> As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="071">71</a> That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="072">72</a> To perform the <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="073">73</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</a> which he sware to our father <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="074">74</a> That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="075">75</a> In <a href="../ebd/ebd180.htm#006">holiness</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> before him, all the days of our life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="076">76</a> And thou, child, shalt be called the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="077">77</a> To give knowledge of <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a> unto his people by the remission of their sins,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="078">78</a> Through the tender <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> of our God; whereby the <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#009">dayspring</a> from on high hath visited us,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="079">79</a> To give light to them that sit in <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a> and in the <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</a> of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="080">80</a> And the child grew, and waxed strong in <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>, and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
