 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Hebrews Chapter 4</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> For unto us was the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a> preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a>, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> For if <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Neither is there any <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#004">creature</a> that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</a> and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Seeing then that we have a great high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, that is passed into the heavens, <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> the Son of God, let us hold <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a> our profession.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> For we have not an high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Let us therefore come boldly unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a>, that we may obtain <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a>, and find <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> to help in time of need.<br>
