 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 9</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then Job answered and said,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with God?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> He is <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Which commandeth the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a>, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the <a href="../ebd/ebd350.htm#008">stars</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Which maketh <a href="../ebd/ebd029.htm#007">Arcturus</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd280.htm#005">Orion</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#006">Pleiades</a>, and the chambers of the south.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> If God will not withdraw his <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>, the proud helpers do stoop under him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to reason with him?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I would make supplication to my <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would despise my life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Now my days are swifter than a <a href="../ebd/ebd299.htm#001">post</a>: they flee away, they see no good.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> They are passed away as the swift <a href="../ebd/ebd339.htm#003">ships</a>: as the <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#003">eagle</a> that hasteth to the prey.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort myself:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> If I wash myself with <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#000">snow</a> water, and make my hands never so <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Neither is there any <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#008">daysman</a> betwixt us, that might lay his hand upon us both.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with me.<br>
 </p>
