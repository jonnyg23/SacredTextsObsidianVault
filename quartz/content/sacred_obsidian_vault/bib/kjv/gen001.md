 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Genesis Chapter 1</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> In the beginning God created the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> and the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And the earth was without form, and void; and <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a> was upon the face of the <a href="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</a>. And the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> of God moved upon the face of the waters.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And God called the light Day, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a> he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And God said, Let there be a <a href="../ebd/ebd134.htm#000">firmament</a> in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And God made the <a href="../ebd/ebd134.htm#000">firmament</a>, and divided the waters which were under the <a href="../ebd/ebd134.htm#000">firmament</a> from the waters which were above the <a href="../ebd/ebd134.htm#000">firmament</a>: and it was so.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And God called the <a href="../ebd/ebd134.htm#000">firmament</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">Heaven</a>. And the evening and the morning were the second day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And God said, Let the waters under the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And God said, Let the earth bring forth <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd174.htm#008">herb</a> yielding seed, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> tree yielding <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And the earth brought forth <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd174.htm#008">herb</a> yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a>, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And the evening and the morning were the third day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And God said, Let there be lights in the <a href="../ebd/ebd134.htm#000">firmament</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for <a href="../ebd/ebd325.htm#003">seasons</a>, and for days, and years:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And let them be for lights in the <a href="../ebd/ebd134.htm#000">firmament</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> to give light upon the earth: and it was so.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the <a href="../ebd/ebd350.htm#008">stars</a> also.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And God set them in the <a href="../ebd/ebd134.htm#000">firmament</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> to give light upon the earth,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>: and God saw that it was good.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#004">creature</a> that hath life, and fowl that may <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#004">fly</a> above the earth in the open <a href="../ebd/ebd134.htm#000">firmament</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And God created great whales, and every living <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#004">creature</a> that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#004">creature</a> after his kind, <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a>, and creeping thing, and <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> of the earth after his kind: and it was so.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And God made the <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> of the earth after his kind, and <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a> after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the <a href="../ebd/ebd134.htm#005">fish</a> of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a>, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the <a href="../ebd/ebd134.htm#005">fish</a> of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And God said, Behold, I have given you every <a href="../ebd/ebd174.htm#008">herb</a> bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And to every <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green <a href="../ebd/ebd174.htm#008">herb</a> for meat: and it was so.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.<br>
