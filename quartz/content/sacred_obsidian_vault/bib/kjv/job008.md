 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 8</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then answered <a href="../ebd/ebd058.htm#006">Bildad</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd341.htm#008">Shuhite</a>, and said,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert <a href="../ebd/ebd214.htm#007">justice</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the <a href="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</a> of thy <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> prosperous.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> (For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</a>:)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their heart?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Can the <a href="../ebd/ebd316.htm#007">rush</a> grow up without mire? can the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#001">flag</a> grow without water?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down, it withereth before any other <a href="../ebd/ebd174.htm#008">herb</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a spider's web.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a>, but it shall not endure.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> He is green before the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a>, and his <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#002">branch</a> shooteth forth in his garden.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> His roots are wrapped about the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</a>, and seeth the place of stones.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he help the evil doers:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.<br>
