 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 16</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then Job answered and said,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye all.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul's stead, I could <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</a> up words against you, and shake mine head at you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should asswage your grief.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and though I forbear, what am I eased?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> against me: and my leanness rising up in me beareth <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> to my face.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd078.htm#004">cheek</a> reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken me by my <a href="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</a>, and shaken me to <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a>, and set me up for his mark.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#001">reins</a> asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my <a href="../ebd/ebd142.htm#000">gall</a> upon the ground.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> He breaketh me with <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#005">breach</a> upon <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#005">breach</a>, he runneth upon me like a giant.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> I have sewed <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#001">sackcloth</a> upon my skin, and defiled my <a href="../ebd/ebd182.htm#003">horn</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</a> of death;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Not for any injustice in mine hands: also my <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a> is pure.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> O earth, cover not thou my <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>, and let my cry have no place.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Also now, behold, my <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> is in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and my record is on high.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for his neighbour!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> When a few years are come, then I shall go the way whence I shall not return.<br>
