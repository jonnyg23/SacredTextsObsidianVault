 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 14</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now it came to pass upon a day, that <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> said unto the young man that bare his <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#006">armour</a>, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines' <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#007">garrison</a>, that is on the other side. But he told not his father.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> tarried in the uttermost part of <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#008">Gibeah</a> under a <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#000">pomegranate</a> tree which is in <a href="../ebd/ebd254.htm#004">Migron</a>: and the people that were with him were about six hundred men;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And Ahiah, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd015.htm#001">Ahitub</a>, Ichabod's brother, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#003">Phinehas</a>, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</a>, the LORD's <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd337.htm#008">Shiloh</a>, wearing an <a href="../ebd/ebd122.htm#008">ephod</a>. And the people knew not that <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> was gone.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And between the passages, by which <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> sought to go over unto the Philistines' <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#007">garrison</a>, there was a sharp <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a> on the one side, and a sharp <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a> on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other <a href="../ebd/ebd327.htm#003">Seneh</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> The forefront of the one was situate <a href="../ebd/ebd275.htm#002">northward</a> over against <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#002">Michmash</a>, and the other southward over against <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#008">Gibeah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> said to the young man that bare his <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#006">armour</a>, Come, and let us go over unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#007">garrison</a> of these uncircumcised: it may be that the LORD will work for us: for there is no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine heart: turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a>, Behold, we will pass over unto these men, and we will discover ourselves unto them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be a sign unto us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And both of them discovered themselves unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#007">garrison</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> said, Behold, the <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#001">Hebrews</a> come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And the men of the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#007">garrison</a> answered <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> and his armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing. And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me: for the LORD hath delivered them into the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armourbearer after him: and they fell before <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a>; and his armourbearer slew after him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And that first slaughter, which <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> and his armourbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half <a href="../ebd/ebd007.htm#004">acre</a> of land, which a <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</a> of oxen might plow.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And there was trembling in the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a>, in the field, and among all the people: the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#007">garrison</a>, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And the watchmen of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#008">Gibeah</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a> looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one another.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> unto the people that were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> and his armourbearer were not there.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of God. For the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of God was at that time with the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And it came to pass, while <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> talked unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, that the noise that was in the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> went on and increased: and <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> said unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, Withdraw thine hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> and all the people that were with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man's <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Moreover the <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#001">Hebrews</a> that were with the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> before that time, which went up with them into the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a> from the country round about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Likewise all the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> which had hid themselves in <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a>, when they heard that the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> So the LORD saved <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> that day: and the battle passed over unto Bethaven.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> were distressed that day: for <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted any food.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And all they of the land came to a <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a>; and there was <a href="../ebd/ebd181.htm#001">honey</a> upon the ground.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And when the people were come into the <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a>, behold, the <a href="../ebd/ebd181.htm#001">honey</a> dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> heard not when his father charged the people with the <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</a>: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</a>, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food this day. And the people were faint.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a>, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this <a href="../ebd/ebd181.htm#001">honey</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And they smote the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> that day from <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#002">Michmash</a> to Aijalon: and the people were very faint.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And the people flew upon the spoil, and took <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them with the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Then they told <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, saying, Behold, the people <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> against the LORD, in that they eat with the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>. And he said, Ye have transgressed: <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#004">roll</a> a great <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> unto me this day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every man his <a href="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</a>, and every man his <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>, and slay them here, and eat; and <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> not against the LORD in <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#006">eating</a> with the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>. And all the people brought every man his <a href="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</a> with him that night, and slew them there.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> built an <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> unto the LORD: the same was the first <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> that he built unto the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> said, Let us go down after the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, Let us draw near hither unto God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>? But he answered him not that day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> hath been this day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> For, as the LORD liveth, which saveth <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, though it be in <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all the people that answered him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> Then said he unto all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, Be ye on one side, and I and <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, Do what seemeth good unto thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> Therefore <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> said unto the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, Give a perfect lot. And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> were taken: but the people escaped.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> said, Cast lots between me and <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> my son. And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> was taken.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> said to <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a>, Tell me what thou hast done. And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> told him, and said, I did but taste a little <a href="../ebd/ebd181.htm#001">honey</a> with the end of the rod that was in mine hand, and, lo, I must die.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt surely die, <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> And the people said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, Shall <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> die, who hath wrought this great <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>? God forbid: as the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a>, that he died not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="046">46</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> went up from following the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> went to their own place.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="047">47</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> took the kingdom over <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>, and against the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a>, and against <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</a>, and against the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd395.htm#005">Zobah</a>, and against the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="048">48</a> And he gathered an <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a>, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> out of the hands of them that spoiled them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="049">49</a> Now the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> were <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a>, and Ishui, and Melchishua: and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the firstborn <a href="../ebd/ebd248.htm#007">Merab</a>, and the name of the younger <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#001">Michal</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="050">50</a> And the name of Saul's wife was <a href="../ebd/ebd014.htm#006">Ahinoam</a>, the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd014.htm#002">Ahimaaz</a>: and the name of the captain of his <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> was <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</a>, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd270.htm#007">Ner</a>, Saul's uncle.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="051">51</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd220.htm#007">Kish</a> was the father of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>; and <a href="../ebd/ebd270.htm#007">Ner</a> the father of <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</a> was the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd002.htm#009">Abiel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="052">52</a> And there was sore war against the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> all the days of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>: and when <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him.<br>
