 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 23</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then they told <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, saying, Behold, the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> fight against <a href="../ebd/ebd216.htm#009">Keilah</a>, and they rob the threshingfloors.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Therefore <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and smite these <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>? And the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, Go, and smite the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>, and save <a href="../ebd/ebd216.htm#009">Keilah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And David's men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>: how much more then if we come to <a href="../ebd/ebd216.htm#009">Keilah</a> against the armies of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> enquired of the LORD yet again. And the LORD answered him and said, Arise, go down to <a href="../ebd/ebd216.htm#009">Keilah</a>; for I will deliver the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> into thine hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> and his men went to <a href="../ebd/ebd216.htm#009">Keilah</a>, and fought with the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>, and brought away their <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a>, and smote them with a great slaughter. So <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> saved the inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd216.htm#009">Keilah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And it came to pass, when <a href="../ebd/ebd002.htm#005">Abiathar</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd014.htm#004">Ahimelech</a> fled to <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd216.htm#009">Keilah</a>, that he came down with an <a href="../ebd/ebd122.htm#008">ephod</a> in his hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And it was told <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> that <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> was come to <a href="../ebd/ebd216.htm#009">Keilah</a>. And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> called all the people together to war, to go down to <a href="../ebd/ebd216.htm#009">Keilah</a>, to besiege <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> and his men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> knew that <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> secretly practised mischief against him; and he said to <a href="../ebd/ebd002.htm#005">Abiathar</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, Bring hither the <a href="../ebd/ebd122.htm#008">ephod</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, O LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, thy servant hath certainly heard that <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> seeketh to come to <a href="../ebd/ebd216.htm#009">Keilah</a>, to destroy the city for my sake.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Will the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd216.htm#009">Keilah</a> deliver me up into his hand? will <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> come down, as thy servant hath heard? O LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the LORD said, He will come down.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, Will the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd216.htm#009">Keilah</a> deliver me and my men into the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>? And the LORD said, They will deliver thee up.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> and his men, which were about six hundred, arose and departed out of <a href="../ebd/ebd216.htm#009">Keilah</a>, and went whithersoever they could go. And it was told <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> that <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> was escaped from <a href="../ebd/ebd216.htm#009">Keilah</a>; and he forbare to go forth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> abode in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#004">Ziph</a>. And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> saw that <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> was come out to seek his life: and <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> was in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#004">Ziph</a> in a <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> Saul's son arose, and went to <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> into the <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a>, and strengthened his hand in God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> over <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> my father knoweth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And they two made a <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> before the LORD: and <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> abode in the <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> went to his house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Then came up the Ziphites to <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#008">Gibeah</a>, saying, Doth not <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> hide himself with us in strong holds in the <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a>, in the hill of <a href="../ebd/ebd156.htm#009">Hachilah</a>, which is on the south of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#002">Jeshimon</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Now therefore, O <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him into the king's hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> said, Blessed be ye of the LORD; for ye have compassion on me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his haunt is, and who hath seen him there: for it is told me that he dealeth very subtilly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And they arose, and went to <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#004">Ziph</a> before <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>: but <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> and his men were in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd241.htm#001">Maon</a>, in the <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</a> on the south of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#002">Jeshimon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> also and his men went to seek him. And they told <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>; wherefore he came down into a <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a>, and abode in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd241.htm#001">Maon</a>. And when <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> heard that, he pursued after <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd241.htm#001">Maon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> went on this side of the mountain, and <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> and his men on that side of the mountain: and <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> made haste to get away for fear of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>; for <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> and his men compassed <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> and his men round about to take them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> But there came a <a href="../ebd/ebd251.htm#005">messenger</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> have invaded the land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Wherefore <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> returned from pursuing after <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, and went against the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>: therefore they called that place Selahammahlekoth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at <a href="../ebd/ebd120.htm#009">Engedi</a>.<br>
