 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 9</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> pillars:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>; she hath also furnished her table.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest places of the city,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Come, eat of my <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> which I have mingled.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#002">blot</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> man, and he will love thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Give instruction to a <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> man, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> If thou be <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a>, thou shalt be <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> for thyself: but if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> A foolish woman is clamorous: she is simple, and knoweth nothing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> To call passengers who go right on their ways:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: and as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Stolen waters are sweet, and <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> eaten in secret is pleasant.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> But he knoweth not that the dead are there; and that her guests are in the depths of <a href="../ebd/ebd173.htm#003">hell</a>.<br>
