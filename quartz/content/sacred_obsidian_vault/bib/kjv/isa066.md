 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 66</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Thus saith the LORD, The <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> is my <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a>, and the earth is my <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#009">footstool</a>: where is the house that ye build unto me? and where is the place of my rest?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> For all those things hath mine hand made, and all those things have been, saith the LORD: but to this man will I look, even to him that is <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> and of a contrite <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>, and trembleth at my word.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> He that killeth an <a href="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</a> is as if he slew a man; he that sacrificeth a <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">lamb</a>, as if he cut off a dog's <a href="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</a>; he that offereth an oblation, as if he offered swine's <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>; he that burneth <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a>, as if he blessed an <a href="../ebd/ebd186.htm#006">idol</a>. Yea, they have <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their abominations.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spake, they did not hear: but they did evil before mine eyes, and chose that in which I delighted not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Hear the word of the LORD, ye that tremble at his word; Your brethren that hated you, that cast you out for my name's sake, said, Let the LORD be glorified: but he shall appear to your joy, and they shall be ashamed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>, a voice of the LORD that rendereth recompence to his enemies.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man child.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? or shall a nation be born at once?  for as soon as <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a> travailed, she brought forth her children.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Shall I bring to the <a href="../ebd/ebd059.htm#002">birth</a>, and not cause to bring forth? saith the LORD: shall I cause to bring forth, and shut the womb? saith thy God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Rejoice ye with <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and be glad with her, all ye that love her: rejoice for joy with her, all ye that <a href="../ebd/ebd261.htm#004">mourn</a> for her:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> That ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that ye may <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#000">milk</a> out, and be delighted with the abundance of her <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a> like a flowing stream: then shall ye suck, ye shall be borne upon her sides, and be dandled upon her knees.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And when ye see this, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like an <a href="../ebd/ebd174.htm#008">herb</a>: and the hand of the LORD shall be known toward his servants, and his indignation toward his enemies.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> For, behold, the LORD will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> with <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</a>, and his rebuke with flames of fire.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> For by fire and by his <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> will the LORD plead with all <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>: and the slain of the LORD shall be many.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#001">gardens</a> behind one tree in the midst, <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#006">eating</a> swine's <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd261.htm#005">mouse</a>, shall be consumed together, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> For I know their works and their thoughts: it shall come, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and see my <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape of them unto the nations, to <a href="../ebd/ebd359.htm#002">Tarshish</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd302.htm#002">Pul</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd232.htm#009">Lud</a>, that draw the <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a>, to <a href="../ebd/ebd373.htm#005">Tubal</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd198.htm#005">Javan</a>, to the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>; and they shall declare my <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> among the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And they shall bring all your brethren for an <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> unto the LORD out of all nations upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy mountain <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, saith the LORD, as the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> bring an <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> in a <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</a> vessel into the house of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And I will also take of them for priests and for Levites, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And it shall come to pass, that from one new <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#004">moon</a> to another, and from one <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> to another, shall all <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> come to <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> before me, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me: for their <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#000">worm</a> shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>.<br>
