 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Judges Chapter 14</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#000">Samson</a> went down to <a href="../ebd/ebd366.htm#006">Timnath</a>, and saw a woman in <a href="../ebd/ebd366.htm#006">Timnath</a> of the daughters of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in <a href="../ebd/ebd366.htm#006">Timnath</a> of the daughters of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>: now therefore get her for me to wife.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>? And <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#000">Samson</a> said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the LORD, that he sought an occasion against the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>: for at that time the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> had dominion over <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Then went <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#000">Samson</a> down, and his father and his mother, to <a href="../ebd/ebd366.htm#006">Timnath</a>, and came to the vineyards of <a href="../ebd/ebd366.htm#006">Timnath</a>: and, behold, a young lion roared against him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</a> him as he would have <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</a> a kid, and he had nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#000">Samson</a> well.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#004">carcase</a> of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees and <a href="../ebd/ebd181.htm#001">honey</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#004">carcase</a> of the lion.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And he took thereof in his hands, and went on <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#006">eating</a>, and came to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat: but he told not them that he had taken the <a href="../ebd/ebd181.htm#001">honey</a> out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#004">carcase</a> of the lion.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> So his father went down unto the woman: and <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#000">Samson</a> made there a <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a>; for so used the young men to do.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#000">Samson</a> said unto them, I will now put forth a <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#003">riddle</a> unto you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> days of the <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a>, and find it out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> But if ye cannot declare it me, then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments. And they said unto him, Put forth thy <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#003">riddle</a>, that we may hear it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days expound the <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#003">riddle</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson's wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#003">riddle</a>, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire: have ye called us to take that we have? is it not so?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#003">riddle</a> unto the children of my people, and hast not told it me. And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told it my father nor my mother, and shall I tell it thee?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And she wept before him the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> days, while their <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a> lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she lay sore upon him: and she told the <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#003">riddle</a> to the children of her people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> went down, What is sweeter than <a href="../ebd/ebd181.htm#001">honey</a>? And what is stronger than a lion?  and he said unto them, If ye had not plowed with my <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#006">heifer</a>, ye had not found out my <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#003">riddle</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to <a href="../ebd/ebd034.htm#001">Ashkelon</a>, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#003">riddle</a>. And his <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> was kindled, and he went up to his father's house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> But Samson's wife was given to his companion, whom he had used as his friend.<br>
