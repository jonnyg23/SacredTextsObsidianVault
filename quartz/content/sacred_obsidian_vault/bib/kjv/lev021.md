 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Leviticus Chapter 21</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, Speak unto the priests the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a>, and say unto them, There shall none be defiled for the dead among his people:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> But for his kin, that is near unto him, that is, for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And for his sister a <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#009">virgin</a>, that is nigh unto him, which hath had no husband; for her may he be defiled.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> But he shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his people, to profane himself.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> They shall not make <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#008">baldness</a> upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#000">beard</a>, nor make any cuttings in their <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of their God: for the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> of their God, they do offer: therefore they shall be holy.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> They shall not take a wife that is a whore, or profane; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband: for he is holy unto his God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> of thy God: he shall be holy unto thee: for I the LORD, which sanctify you, am holy.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And the daughter of any <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, if she profane herself by playing the whore, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with fire.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And he that is the high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> among his brethren, upon whose head the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Neither shall he go out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</a>, nor profane the <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</a> of his God; for the <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</a> of the anointing oil of his God is upon him: I am the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And he shall take a wife in her virginity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> A widow, or a divorced woman, or profane, or an <a href="../ebd/ebd164.htm#005">harlot</a>, these shall he not take: but he shall take a <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#009">virgin</a> of his own people to wife.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Neither shall he profane his seed among his people: for I the LORD do sanctify him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And the LORD spake unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Speak unto <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a>, saying, Whosoever he be of thy seed in their generations that hath any <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#007">blemish</a>, let him not approach to offer the <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> of his God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> For whatsoever man he be that hath a <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#007">blemish</a>, he shall not approach: a <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a> man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or any thing superfluous,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Or a man that is brokenfooted, or brokenhanded,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Or crookbackt, or a <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#009">dwarf</a>, or that hath a <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#007">blemish</a> in his eye, or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> No man that hath a <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#007">blemish</a> of the seed of <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the LORD made by fire: he hath a <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#007">blemish</a>; he shall not come nigh to offer the <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> of his God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> He shall eat the <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Only he shall not go in unto the vail, nor come nigh unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a>, because he hath a <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#007">blemish</a>; that he profane not my sanctuaries: for I the LORD do sanctify them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> told it unto <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a>, and to his sons, and unto all the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
