 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 18</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> The word which came to <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> from the LORD, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will cause thee to hear my words.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Then I went down to the potter's house, and, behold, he wrought a work on the wheels.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And the vessel that he made of <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#004">clay</a> was marred in the hand of the potter: so he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> O house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, cannot I do with you as this potter? saith the LORD. Behold, as the <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#004">clay</a> is in the potter's hand, so are ye in mine hand, O house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy it;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> If that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> If it do evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good, wherewith I said I would benefit them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Now therefore go to, speak to the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and to the inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I frame evil against you, and devise a device against you: return ye now every one from his evil way, and make your ways and your doings good.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And they said, There is no hope: but we will walk after our own devices, and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ask ye now among the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a>, who hath heard such things: the <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#009">virgin</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> hath done a very horrible thing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Will a man leave the <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#000">snow</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</a> which cometh from the <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a> of the field? or shall the cold flowing waters that come from another place be forsaken?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Because my people hath forgotten me, they have burned <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a> to vanity, and they have caused them to stumble in their ways from the ancient paths, to walk in paths, in a way not cast up;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> To make their land desolate, and a perpetual hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished, and wag his head.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> I will scatter them as with an <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a> wind before the enemy; I will shew them the back, and not the face, in the day of their calamity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Then said they, Come and let us devise devices against <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a>; for the law shall not perish from the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, nor counsel from the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a>, nor the word from the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>. Come, and let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Give heed to me, O LORD, and hearken to the voice of them that contend with me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have digged a <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a> for my soul. Remember that I stood before thee to speak good for them, and to turn away thy wrath from them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Therefore deliver up their children to the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a>, and pour out their <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> by the force of the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>; and let their wives be bereaved of their children, and be <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#003">widows</a>; and let their men be put to death; let their young men be slain by the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> in battle.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Let a cry be heard from their houses, when thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them: for they have digged a <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a> to take me, and hid snares for my feet.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Yet, LORD, thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay me: forgive not their iniquity, neither <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#002">blot</a> out their <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> from thy sight, but let them be overthrown before thee; deal thus with them in the time of thine <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>.<br>
