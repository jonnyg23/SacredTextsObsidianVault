 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 19</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a> told <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#006">Jezebel</a> all that <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a> had done, and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#006">Jezebel</a> sent a <a href="../ebd/ebd251.htm#005">messenger</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a>, saying, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by to morrow about this time.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to <a href="../ebd/ebd050.htm#008">Beersheba</a>, which belongeth to <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and left his servant there.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> But he himself went a day's <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</a> into the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, and came and sat down under a <a href="../ebd/ebd214.htm#005">juniper</a> tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And as he lay and slept under a <a href="../ebd/ebd214.htm#005">juniper</a> tree, behold, then an <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And he looked, and, behold, there was a <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#009">cake</a> baken on the coals, and a <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#004">cruse</a> of water at his head. And he did eat and <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>, and laid him down again.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the LORD came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise and eat; because the <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</a> is too great for thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And he arose, and did eat and <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto <a href="../ebd/ebd181.htm#009">Horeb</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And he came thither unto a <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#006">cave</a>, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of the LORD came to him, and he said unto him, What doest thou here, <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: for the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> have forsaken thy <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a>, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> before the LORD. And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</a> the mountains, and brake in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a> the rocks before the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind: and after the wind an <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#009">earthquake</a>; but the LORD was not in the <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#009">earthquake</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And after the <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#009">earthquake</a> a fire; but the LORD was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And it was so, when <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a> heard it, that he wrapped his face in his <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#009">mantle</a>, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#006">cave</a>. And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou here, <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: because the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> have forsaken thy <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a>, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And the LORD said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</a>: and when thou comest, <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#008">anoint</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd168.htm#003">Hazael</a> to be <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> over <a href="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd273.htm#005">Nimshi</a> shalt thou <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#008">anoint</a> to be <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> over <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd331.htm#005">Shaphat</a> of Abelmeholah shalt thou <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#008">anoint</a> to be <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> in thy room.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd168.htm#003">Hazael</a> shall <a href="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</a> slay: and him that escapeth from the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</a> shall <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</a> slay.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Yet I have left me <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> thousand in <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, all the knees which have not bowed unto <a href="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</a>, and every mouth which hath not kissed him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> So he departed thence, and found <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd331.htm#005">Shaphat</a>, who was plowing with twelve <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</a> of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth: and <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a> passed by him, and cast his <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#009">mantle</a> upon him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And he left the oxen, and ran after <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a>, and said, Let me, I pray thee, <a href="../ebd/ebd221.htm#000">kiss</a> my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee. And he said unto him, Go back again: for what have I done to thee?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And he returned back from him, and took a <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</a> of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> with the instruments of the oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a>, and ministered unto him.<br>
