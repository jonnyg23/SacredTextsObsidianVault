 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 19</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Moreover take thou up a <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#005">lamentation</a> for the princes of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And say, What is thy mother? A lioness: she lay down among <a href="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</a>, she nourished her whelps among young <a href="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And she brought up one of her whelps: it became a young lion, and it learned to catch the prey; it devoured men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a>, and they brought him with chains unto the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Now when she saw that she had waited, and her hope was lost, then she took another of her whelps, and made him a young lion.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And he went up and down among the <a href="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</a>, he became a young lion, and learned to catch the prey, and devoured men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And he knew their desolate palaces, and he laid waste their cities; and the land was desolate, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#007">fulness</a> thereof, by the noise of his roaring.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces, and spread their <a href="../ebd/ebd271.htm#002">net</a> over him: he was taken in their <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And they put him in <a href="../ebd/ebd379.htm#001">ward</a> in chains, and brought him to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>: they brought him into holds, that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Thy mother is like a <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</a> in thy <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>, planted by the waters: she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule, and her stature was exalted among the thick branches, and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> But she was plucked up in <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</a>, she was cast down to the ground, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a> wind dried up her <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a>: her strong rods were broken and withered; the fire consumed them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And now she is planted in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, in a dry and thirsty ground.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And fire is gone out of a rod of her branches, which hath devoured her <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a>, so that she hath no strong rod to be a <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#006">sceptre</a> to rule. This is a <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#005">lamentation</a>, and shall be for a <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#005">lamentation</a>.<br>
