 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Ecclesiastes Chapter 7</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> A good name is better than precious <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#007">ointment</a>; and the day of death than the day of one's <a href="../ebd/ebd059.htm#002">birth</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> The heart of the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> It is better to hear the rebuke of the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a>, than for a man to hear the song of fools.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool: this also is vanity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Surely oppression maketh a <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> man mad; and a <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</a> destroyeth the heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and the patient in <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> is better than the proud in <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Be not hasty in thy <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> to be angry: for <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> resteth in the <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#008">bosom</a> of fools.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to them that see the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them that have it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just man that perisheth in his <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a>: why shouldest thou destroy thyself ?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Wisdom strengtheneth the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> more than ten mighty men which are in the city.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</a> thee:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a>; but it was far from me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> That which is far off, and exceeding <a href="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</a>, who can find it out?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason of things, and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness and <a href="../ebd/ebd236.htm#002">madness</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And I find more <a href="../ebd/ebd059.htm#009">bitter</a> than death the woman, whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands as <a href="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">bands</a>: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, counting one by one, to find out the account:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.<br>
