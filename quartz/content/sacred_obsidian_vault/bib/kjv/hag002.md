 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Haggai Chapter 2</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> In the seventh month, in the one and twentieth day of the month, came the word of the LORD by the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> Haggai, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Speak now to <a href="../ebd/ebd391.htm#008">Zerubbabel</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd332.htm#003">Shealtiel</a>, governor of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and to <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> the son of Josedech, the high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, and to the residue of the people, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Who is left among you that saw this house in her first <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>? and how do ye see it now? is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Yet now be strong, O <a href="../ebd/ebd391.htm#008">Zerubbabel</a>, saith the LORD; and be strong, O <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a>, son of Josedech, the high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>; and be strong, all ye people of the land, saith the LORD, and work: for I am with you, saith the LORD of hosts:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> According to the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, so my <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> remaineth among you: fear ye not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> For thus saith the LORD of hosts; Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>, saith the LORD of hosts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> is mine, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> is mine, saith the LORD of hosts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, saith the LORD of hosts: and in this place will I give peace, saith the LORD of hosts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the second year of <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#007">Darius</a>, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ask now the priests concerning the law, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> If one bear holy <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>, or <a href="../ebd/ebd299.htm#005">pottage</a>, or <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>, or oil, or any meat, shall it be holy? And the priests answered and said, No.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Then said Haggai, If one that is unclean by a dead body touch any of these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It shall be unclean.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Then answered Haggai, and said, So is this people, and so is this nation before me, saith the LORD; and so is every work of their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward, from before a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> was laid upon a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> of the LORD:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Since those days were, when one came to an <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</a> of twenty measures, there were but ten: when one came to the pressfat for to draw out fifty vessels out of the press, there were but twenty.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> I smote you with blasting and with <a href="../ebd/ebd254.htm#007">mildew</a> and with <a href="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</a> in all the labours of your hands; yet ye turned not to me, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Consider now from this day and upward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, even from the day that the foundation of the LORD's <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> was laid, consider it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Is the seed yet in the <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#004">barn</a>? yea, as yet the <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd133.htm#001">fig</a> tree, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#000">pomegranate</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#009">olive</a> tree, hath not brought forth: from this day will I <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a> you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And again the word of the LORD came unto Haggai in the four and twentieth day of the month, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Speak to <a href="../ebd/ebd391.htm#008">Zerubbabel</a>, governor of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And I will overthrow the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a>; and I will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> of his brother.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, will I take thee, O <a href="../ebd/ebd391.htm#008">Zerubbabel</a>, my servant, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd332.htm#003">Shealtiel</a>, saith the LORD, and will make thee as a <a href="../ebd/ebd343.htm#001">signet</a>: for I have <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> thee, saith the LORD of hosts.<br>
