 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Psalms Chapter 111</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Praise ye the LORD. I will praise the LORD with my whole heart, in the assembly of the upright, and in the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> The works of the LORD are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> His work is honourable and glorious: and his <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> endureth for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the LORD is gracious and full of compassion.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be mindful of his <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may give them the heritage of the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his commandments are sure.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> They stand <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a> for ever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> He sent <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#009">redemption</a> unto his people: he hath commanded his <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> for ever: holy and reverend is his name.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do his commandments: his praise endureth for ever.<br>
