 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 5</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now will I sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</a>, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a winepress therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And now, O inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and men of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a>, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; and break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor digged; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a> no <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a> upon it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> his pleasant plant: and he looked for judgment, but behold oppression; for <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>, but behold a cry.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till there be no place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> In mine ears said the LORD of hosts, Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one <a href="../ebd/ebd047.htm#003">bath</a>, and the seed of an <a href="../ebd/ebd181.htm#000">homer</a> shall yield an <a href="../ebd/ebd122.htm#003">ephah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>; that continue until night, till <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> inflame them!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd165.htm#001">harp</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#007">viol</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#009">tabret</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#000">pipe</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>, are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the LORD, neither consider the operation of his hands.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Therefore my people are gone into <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a>, because they have no knowledge: and their honourable men are famished, and their multitude dried up with thirst.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Therefore <a href="../ebd/ebd173.htm#003">hell</a> hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without measure: and their <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth, shall descend into it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> But the LORD of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God that is holy shall be sanctified in <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste places of the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</a> ones shall strangers eat.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> as it were with a <a href="../ebd/ebd073.htm#001">cart</a> rope:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> That say, Let him make speed, and hasten his work, that we may see it: and let the counsel of the Holy One of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> draw nigh and come, that we may know it!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a> for light, and light for <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>; that put <a href="../ebd/ebd059.htm#009">bitter</a> for sweet, and sweet for <a href="../ebd/ebd059.htm#009">bitter</a>!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Woe unto them that are <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Woe unto them that are mighty to <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>, and men of strength to mingle strong <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Which justify the wicked for reward, and take away the <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> of the righteous from him!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame consumeth the <a href="../ebd/ebd075.htm#007">chaff</a>, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a>: because they have cast away the law of the LORD of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Therefore is the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> of the LORD kindled against his people, and he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath smitten them: and the hills did tremble, and their carcases were torn in the midst of the streets. For all this his <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And he will lift up an <a href="../ebd/ebd121.htm#008">ensign</a> to the nations from far, and will <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#005">hiss</a> unto them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#005">girdle</a> of their loins be loosed, nor the <a href="../ebd/ebd224.htm#006">latchet</a> of their shoes be broken:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Whose <a href="../ebd/ebd032.htm#005">arrows</a> are sharp, and all their bows bent, their horses' hoofs shall be counted like <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#009">flint</a>, and their wheels like a whirlwind:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Their roaring shall be like a lion, they shall roar like young <a href="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</a>: yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and shall carry it away safe, and none shall deliver it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea: and if one look unto the land, behold <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a> and sorrow, and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof.<br>
