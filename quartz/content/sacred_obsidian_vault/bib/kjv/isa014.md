 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 14</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> For the LORD will have <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> on <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, and will yet choose <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and set them in their own land: and the strangers shall be joined with them, and they shall cleave to the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And the people shall take them, and bring them to their place: and the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> shall possess them in the land of the LORD for servants and handmaids: and they shall take them captives, whose captives they were; and they shall rule over their oppressors.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And it shall come to pass in the day that the LORD shall give thee rest from thy sorrow, and from thy fear, and from the hard <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#002">bondage</a> wherein thou wast made to serve,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> That thou shalt take up this <a href="../ebd/ebd301.htm#002">proverb</a> against the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, and say, How hath the oppressor ceased! the golden city ceased!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> The LORD hath broken the staff of the wicked, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#006">sceptre</a> of the rulers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> He who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke, he that ruled the nations in <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>, is persecuted, and none hindereth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet: they break forth into singing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Yea, the <a href="../ebd/ebd133.htm#005">fir</a> trees rejoice at thee, and the cedars of <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</a>, saying, Since thou art laid down, no feller is come up against us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd173.htm#003">Hell</a> from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming: it stirreth up the dead for thee, even all the chief ones of the earth; it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> All they shall speak and say unto thee, Art thou also become weak as we? art thou become like unto us?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Thy pomp is brought down to the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</a>, and the noise of thy viols: the <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#000">worm</a> is spread under thee, and the worms cover thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> How art thou fallen from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, O <a href="../ebd/ebd232.htm#006">Lucifer</a>, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, I will exalt my <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> above the <a href="../ebd/ebd350.htm#008">stars</a> of God: I will sit also upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a>, in the sides of the north:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Yet thou shalt be brought down to <a href="../ebd/ebd173.htm#003">hell</a>, to the sides of the <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and consider thee, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> That made the world as a <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, and destroyed the cities thereof; that opened not the house of his prisoners?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> All the kings of the nations, even all of them, lie in <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>, every one in his own house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> But thou art cast out of thy <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</a> like an abominable <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#002">branch</a>, and as the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through with a <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, that go down to the stones of the <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a>; as a <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#004">carcase</a> trodden under feet.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Thou shalt not be joined with them in <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#008">burial</a>, because thou hast destroyed thy land, and slain thy people: the seed of evildoers shall never be renowned.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers; that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill the face of the world with cities.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> For I will rise up against them, saith the LORD of hosts, and cut off from <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> the name, and remnant, and son, and nephew, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> I will also make it a possession for the <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#000">bittern</a>, and pools of water: and I will sweep it with the <a href="../ebd/ebd053.htm#009">besom</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a>, saith the LORD of hosts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> The LORD of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, so shall it stand:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> That I will break the Assyrian in my land, and upon my mountains tread him under foot: then shall his <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</a> depart from off them, and his <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</a> depart from off their shoulders.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth: and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> For the LORD of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul it? and his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> In the year that <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#005">Ahaz</a> died was this <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Rejoice not thou, whole Palestina, because the rod of him that smote thee is broken: for out of the serpent's root shall come forth a <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#007">cockatrice</a>, and his <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> shall be a fiery flying <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#009">serpent</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And the firstborn of the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> shall feed, and the needy shall lie down in safety: and I will kill thy root with <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a>, and he shall slay thy remnant.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Howl, O <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a>; cry, O city; thou, whole Palestina, art dissolved: for there shall come from the north a smoke, and none shall be alone in his appointed times.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> What shall one then answer the messengers of the nation? That the LORD hath founded <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> of his people shall trust in it.<br>
