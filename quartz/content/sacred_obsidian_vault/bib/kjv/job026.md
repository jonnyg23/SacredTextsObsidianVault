 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 26</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> But Job answered and said,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> How hast thou helped him that is without power? how savest thou the arm that hath no strength?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom? and how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> came from thee?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Dead things are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd173.htm#003">Hell</a> is <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</a> before him, and <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a> hath no covering.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a> is not <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</a> under them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> He holdeth back the face of his <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a>, and spreadeth his <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a> upon it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> The pillars of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> tremble and are astonished at his reproof.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> By his <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#009">serpent</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#003">thunder</a> of his power who can understand?<br>
