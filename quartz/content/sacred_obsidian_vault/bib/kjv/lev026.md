 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Leviticus Chapter 26</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> in your land, to <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a> down unto it: for I am the LORD your God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</a>: I am the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Then I will give you <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a> in due season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And your <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#009">threshing</a> shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> to the full, and dwell in your land safely.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither shall the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> go through your land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you by the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> with you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of the new.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And I set my <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a> among you: and my soul shall not abhor you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the <a href="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">bands</a> of your <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</a>, and made you go upright.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but that ye break my <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> I also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning <a href="../ebd/ebd012.htm#008">ague</a>, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> times more for your sins.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> as <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a>, and your earth as <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I will bring <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> times more plagues upon you according to your sins.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a>, and make you few in number; and your high ways shall be desolate.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary unto me;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you yet <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> times for your sins.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And I will bring a <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of my <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a>: and when ye are gathered together within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And when I have broken the staff of your <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>, ten women shall <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#001">bake</a> your <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> in one <a href="../ebd/ebd281.htm#005">oven</a>, and they shall deliver you your <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Then I will walk contrary unto you also in <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</a>; and I, even I, will chastise you <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> times for your sins.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And ye shall eat the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> of your sons, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> of your daughters shall ye eat.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And I will scatter you among the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a>, and will draw out a <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye be in your enemies' land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken <a href="../ebd/ebd225.htm#004">leaf</a> shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>; and they shall fall when none pursueth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> And ye shall perish among the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a>, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> And that I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the <a href="../ebd/ebd302.htm#005">punishment</a> of their iniquity:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> Then will I remember my <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> with <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, and also my <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> with <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a>, and also my <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> with <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> will I remember; and I will remember the land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the <a href="../ebd/ebd302.htm#005">punishment</a> of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> with them: for I am the LORD their God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> But I will for their sakes remember the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> in the sight of the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a>, that I might be their God: I am the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="046">46</a> These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#009">Sinai</a> by the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>.<br>
