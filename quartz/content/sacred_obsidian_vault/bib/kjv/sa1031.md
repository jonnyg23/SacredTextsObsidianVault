 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 31</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> fought against <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: and the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> fled from before the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>, and fell down slain in <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#008">Gilboa</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> followed hard upon <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> and upon his sons; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> slew <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd004.htm#001">Abinadab</a>, and Melchishua, Saul's sons.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And the battle went sore against <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, and the archers hit him; and he was sore wounded of the archers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> unto his armourbearer, Draw thy <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> took a <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, and fell upon it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And when his armourbearer saw that <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> was dead, he fell likewise upon his <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, and died with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all his men, that same day together.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And when the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> that were on the other side of the <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a>, and they that were on the other side <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a>, saw that the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> fled, and that <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> came and dwelt in them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And it came to pass on the morrow, when the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> came to strip the slain, that they found <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> and his three sons fallen in <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#008">Gilboa</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And they cut off his head, and stripped off his <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#006">armour</a>, and sent into the land of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> round about, to publish it in the house of their idols, and among the people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And they put his <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#006">armour</a> in the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd034.htm#004">Ashtaroth</a>: and they fastened his body to the wall of Bethshan.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard of that which the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> had done to <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Bethshan, and came to <a href="../ebd/ebd193.htm#007">Jabesh</a>, and burnt them there.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And they took their bones, and buried them under a tree at <a href="../ebd/ebd193.htm#007">Jabesh</a>, and fasted <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> days.<br>
