 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 20</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">Wine</a> is a mocker, strong <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> is raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> The fear of a <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> is as the roaring of a lion: whoso provoketh him to <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> sinneth against his own soul.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> It is an honour for a man to cease from strife: but every fool will be meddling.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; therefore shall he <a href="../ebd/ebd051.htm#001">beg</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd165.htm#008">harvest</a>, and have nothing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Counsel in the heart of man is like <a href="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</a> water; but a man of understanding will draw it out.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Most men will proclaim every one his own <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</a>: but a <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a> man who can find?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> The just man walketh in his integrity: his children are blessed after him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> A <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> that sitteth in the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> of judgment scattereth away all evil with his eyes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Who can say, I have made my heart <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</a>, I am pure from my <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Divers <a href="../ebd/ebd380.htm#006">weights</a>, and divers measures, both of them are alike <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</a> to the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work be pure, and whether it be right.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> The hearing <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a>, and the seeing eye, the LORD hath made even both of them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes, and thou shalt be satisfied with <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> It is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer: but when he is gone his way, then he boasteth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> There is <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Take his garment that is <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#005">surety</a> for a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a>: and take a <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#005">pledge</a> of him for a strange woman.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">Bread</a> of deceit is sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Every purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice make war.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> He that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets: therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#007">lamp</a> shall be put out in obscure <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning; but the end thereof shall not be blessed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Say not thou, I will recompense evil; but wait on the LORD, and he shall save thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Divers <a href="../ebd/ebd380.htm#006">weights</a> are an <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</a> unto the LORD; and a false <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#007">balance</a> is not good.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Man's goings are of the LORD; how can a man then understand his own way?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> It is a <a href="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</a> to the man who devoureth that which is holy, and after <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#001">vows</a> to make enquiry.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> A <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#001">wheel</a> over them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> of man is the <a href="../ebd/ebd071.htm#000">candle</a> of the LORD, searching all the inward parts of the <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">Mercy</a> and truth preserve the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>: and his <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> is upholden by <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of young men is their strength: and the beauty of old men is the grey head.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so do <a href="../ebd/ebd352.htm#005">stripes</a> the inward parts of the <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</a>.<br>
