 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Romans Chapter 11</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, of the <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#005">scripture</a> saith of <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#002">Elias</a>? how he maketh intercession to God against <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of <a href="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And if by <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a>, then is it no more of works: otherwise <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> is no more <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a>. But if it be of works, then it is no more <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a>: otherwise work is no more work.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> What then? <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> (According as it is written, God hath given them the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> saith, Let their table be made a <a href="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</a>, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a> down their back alway.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a> is come unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>, for to provoke them to <a href="../ebd/ebd198.htm#008">jealousy</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>; how much more their <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#007">fulness</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> For I speak to you <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>, inasmuch as I am the <a href="../ebd/ebd026.htm#008">apostle</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>, I magnify mine office:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, and might save some of them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#009">olive</a> tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#009">olive</a> tree;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Behold therefore the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</a> and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</a>, if thou continue in his <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</a>: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> For if thou wert cut out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#009">olive</a> tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#009">olive</a> tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be graffed into their own <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#009">olive</a> tree?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this <a href="../ebd/ebd263.htm#006">mystery</a>, lest ye should be <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, until the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#007">fulness</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a> be come in.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And so all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of <a href="../ebd/ebd345.htm#003">Sion</a> the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> For this is my <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> unto them, when I shall take away their sins.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> As concerning the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a>, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the father's sakes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> For the gifts and <a href="../ebd/ebd069.htm#007">calling</a> of God are without <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#008">repentance</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> through their unbelief:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Even so have these also now not believed, that through your <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> they also may obtain <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> upon all.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!  how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#005">counsellor</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> for ever. <a href="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</a>.<br>
