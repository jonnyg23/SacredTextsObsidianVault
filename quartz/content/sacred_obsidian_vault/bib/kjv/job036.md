 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 36</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#008">Elihu</a> also proceeded, and said,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on God's behalf.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> to my Maker.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a>; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> He openeth also their <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a> to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> But if they obey not, they shall perish by the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, and they shall die without knowledge.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> But the hypocrites in heart <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</a> up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> He delivereth the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and <a href="../ebd/ebd214.htm#007">justice</a> take hold on thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke: then a great <a href="../ebd/ebd307.htm#005">ransom</a> cannot deliver thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Will he esteem thy riches? no, not <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, nor all the <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#000">forces</a> of strength.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> rather than affliction.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a> according to the vapour thereof:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise of his <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to shine by the <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a> that cometh betwixt.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a> also concerning the vapour.<br>
