 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 7</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not his days also like the days of an <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#004">hireling</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> As a servant earnestly desireth the <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</a>, and as an <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#004">hireling</a> looketh for the reward of his work:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> My <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> is clothed with worms and clods of <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a>; my skin is broken, and become loathsome.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine eyes are upon me, and I am not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> As the <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a> is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</a> shall come up no more.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Am I a sea, or a <a href="../ebd/ebd380.htm#009">whale</a>, that thou settest a watch over me?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#002">couch</a> shall ease my complaints;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days are vanity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him every moment?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#009">swallow</a> down my spittle?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men?  why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</a> to myself?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And why dost thou not <a href="../ebd/ebd285.htm#001">pardon</a> my transgression, and take away my iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a>; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.<br>
