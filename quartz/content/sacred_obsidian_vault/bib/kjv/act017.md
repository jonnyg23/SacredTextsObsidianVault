 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Acts Chapter 17</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now when they had passed through <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#009">Amphipolis</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd026.htm#005">Apollonia</a>, they came to <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#000">Thessalonica</a>, where was a <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</a> of the Jews:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a>, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Opening and alleging, that <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, whom I preach unto you, is <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And some of them believed, and consorted with <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd343.htm#004">Silas</a>; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd198.htm#002">Jason</a>, and sought to bring them out to the people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And when they found them not, they drew <a href="../ebd/ebd198.htm#002">Jason</a> and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Whom <a href="../ebd/ebd198.htm#002">Jason</a> hath received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#002">Caesar</a>, saying that there is another <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, one <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And when they had taken security of <a href="../ebd/ebd198.htm#002">Jason</a>, and of the other, they let them go.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And the brethren immediately sent away <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd343.htm#004">Silas</a> by night unto <a href="../ebd/ebd053.htm#002">Berea</a>: who coming thither went into the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</a> of the Jews.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> These were more noble than those in <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#000">Thessalonica</a>, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> But when the Jews of <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#000">Thessalonica</a> had knowledge that the word of God was preached of <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> at <a href="../ebd/ebd053.htm#002">Berea</a>, they came thither also, and stirred up the people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And then immediately the brethren sent away <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> to go as it were to the sea: but <a href="../ebd/ebd343.htm#004">Silas</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd367.htm#001">Timotheus</a> abode there still.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And they that conducted <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> brought him unto <a href="../ebd/ebd036.htm#003">Athens</a>: and receiving a commandment unto <a href="../ebd/ebd343.htm#004">Silas</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd367.htm#001">Timotheus</a> for to come to him with all speed, they departed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Now while <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> waited for them at <a href="../ebd/ebd036.htm#003">Athens</a>, his <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to <a href="../ebd/ebd186.htm#007">idolatry</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Therefore disputed he in the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</a> with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Then certain philosophers of the <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#009">Epicureans</a>, and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, and the resurrection.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And they took him, and brought him unto <a href="../ebd/ebd030.htm#001">Areopagus</a>, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> (For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, Ye men of <a href="../ebd/ebd036.htm#003">Athens</a>, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a>, him declare I unto you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And hath made of one <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their <a href="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the <a href="../ebd/ebd151.htm#006">Godhead</a> is like unto <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, or <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, or <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a>, graven by art and man's device.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> the world in <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#004">assurance</a> unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this matter.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> departed from among them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the which was <a href="../ebd/ebd104.htm#001">Dionysius</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd030.htm#000">Areopagite</a>, and a woman named <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#006">Damaris</a>, and others with them.<br>
