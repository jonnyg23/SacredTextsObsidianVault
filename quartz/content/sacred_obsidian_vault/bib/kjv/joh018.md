 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: John Chapter 18</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> When <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#006">brook</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#008">Cedron</a>, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#001">Judas</a> also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#001">Judas</a> then, having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a>, cometh thither with lanterns and <a href="../ebd/ebd370.htm#008">torches</a> and weapons.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> They answered him, <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#007">Nazareth</a>. <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> saith unto them, I am he. And <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#001">Judas</a> also, which betrayed him, stood with them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#007">Nazareth</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, Of them which thou gavest me have I lost none.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> having a <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a>. The servant's name was <a href="../ebd/ebd239.htm#003">Malchus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a>, Put up thy <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> into the sheath: the <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</a> which my Father hath given me, shall I not <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> it?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, and bound him,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And led him away to <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#007">Annas</a> first; for he was father in law to <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#006">Caiaphas</a>, which was the high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> that same year.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Now <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#006">Caiaphas</a> was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> followed <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, and so did another <a href="../ebd/ebd104.htm#003">disciple</a>: that <a href="../ebd/ebd104.htm#003">disciple</a> was known unto the high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, and went in with <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> into the <a href="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</a> of the high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> stood at the door without. Then went out that other <a href="../ebd/ebd104.htm#003">disciple</a>, which was known unto the high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a>, Art not thou also one of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> stood with them, and warmed himself.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> The high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> then asked <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> of his disciples, and of his doctrine.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</a>, and in the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> so?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Now <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#007">Annas</a> had sent him bound unto <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#006">Caiaphas</a> the high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> One of the servants of the high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, being his <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#006">kinsman</a> whose <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Then led they <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> from <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#006">Caiaphas</a> unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> That the saying of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, and said unto him, Art thou the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</a> of the Jews?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> Pilate answered, Am I a <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#004">Jew</a>? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> then? <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answered, Thou sayest that I am a <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault at all.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> But ye have a <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#008">custom</a>, that I should release unto you one at the <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</a>: will ye therefore that I release unto you the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</a> of the Jews?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but <a href="../ebd/ebd044.htm#002">Barabbas</a>. Now <a href="../ebd/ebd044.htm#002">Barabbas</a> was a robber.<br>
