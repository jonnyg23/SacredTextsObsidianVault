 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 9</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a <a href="../ebd/ebd138.htm#000">fountain</a> of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Oh that I had in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> a lodging place of wayfaring men; that I might leave my people, and go from them! for they be all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And they bend their tongues like their <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a> for lies: but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth; for they proceed from evil to evil, and they know not me, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Take ye heed every one of his neighbour, and trust ye not in any brother: for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbour will walk with slanders.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And they will deceive every one his neighbour, and will not speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies, and weary themselves to commit iniquity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Thine <a href="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</a> is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know me, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will melt them, and try them; for how shall I do for the daughter of my people?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Their tongue is as an arrow shot out; it speaketh deceit: one speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth, but in heart he layeth his wait.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Shall I not visit them for these things? saith the LORD: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the habitations of the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> a <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#005">lamentation</a>, because they are burned up, so that none can pass through them; neither can men hear the voice of the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a>; both the fowl of the heavens and the <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> are fled; they are gone.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And I will make <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> heaps, and a <a href="../ebd/ebd101.htm#007">den</a> of dragons; and I will make the cities of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> desolate, without an inhabitant.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Who is the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> man, that may understand this? and who is he to whom the mouth of the LORD hath spoken, that he may declare it, for what the land perisheth and is burned up like a <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, that none passeth through?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And the LORD saith, Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked therein;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> But have walked after the imagination of their own heart, and after <a href="../ebd/ebd039.htm#007">Baalim</a>, which their fathers taught them:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#001">wormwood</a>, and give them water of <a href="../ebd/ebd142.htm#000">gall</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> I will scatter them also among the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a>, whom neither they nor their fathers have known: and I will send a <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> after them, till I have consumed them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Consider ye, and call for the mourning women, that they may come; and send for cunning women, that they may come:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> For a voice of wailing is heard out of <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a>, How are we spoiled! we are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because our <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#001">dwellings</a> have cast us out.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Yet hear the word of the LORD, O ye women, and let your <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a> receive the word of his mouth, and teach your daughters wailing, and every one her neighbour <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#005">lamentation</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> For death is come up into our windows, and is entered into our palaces, to cut off the children from without, and the young men from the streets.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Speak, Thus saith the LORD, Even the carcases of men shall fall as <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#003">dung</a> upon the open field, and as the handful after the harvestman, and none shall gather them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Thus saith the LORD, Let not the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> man <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> in his might, let not the rich man <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> in his riches:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> But let him that glorieth <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the LORD which exercise lovingkindness, judgment, and <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>, in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will punish all them which are circumcised with the uncircumcised;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</a>, and the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>, and all that are in the utmost corners, that dwell in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>: for all these nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> are uncircumcised in the heart.<br>
