 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 48</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Hear ye this, O house of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, which are called by the name of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and are come forth out of the waters of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, which swear by the name of the LORD, and make mention of the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, but not in truth, nor in <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> For they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves upon the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; The LORD of hosts is his name.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> I have declared the former things from the beginning; and they went forth out of my mouth, and I shewed them; I did them suddenly, and they came to pass.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy <a href="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</a> is an <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a> sinew, and thy brow <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> I have even from the beginning declared it to thee; before it came to pass I shewed it thee: lest thou shouldest say, Mine <a href="../ebd/ebd186.htm#006">idol</a> hath done them, and my graven image, and my molten image, hath commanded them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Thou hast heard, see all this; and will not ye declare it? I have shewed thee new things from this time, even hidden things, and thou didst not know them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the day when thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that time that thine <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a> was not opened: for I knew that thou wouldest deal very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the womb.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> For my name's sake will I defer mine <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>, and for my praise will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Behold, I have refined thee, but not with <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>; I have <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> thee in the <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#000">furnace</a> of affliction.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> For mine own sake, even for mine own sake, will I do it: for how should my name be polluted? and I will not give my <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> unto another.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Hearken unto me, O <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, my called; I am he; I am the first, I also am the last.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spanned the heavens: when I call unto them, they stand up together.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; which among them hath declared these things? The LORD hath loved him: he will do his pleasure on <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, and his arm shall be on the Chaldeans.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> I, even I, have spoken; yea, I have called him: I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; I have not spoken in secret from the beginning; from the time that it was, there am I: and now the Lord GOD, and his <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a>, hath sent me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Thus saith the LORD, thy <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#008">Redeemer</a>, the Holy One of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; I am the LORD thy God which teacheth thee to profit, which leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> as the waves of the sea:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#004">bowels</a> like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Go ye forth of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, flee ye from the Chaldeans, with a voice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter it even to the end of the earth; say ye, The LORD hath redeemed his servant <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts: he caused the waters to flow out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a> for them: he clave the <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a> also, and the waters gushed out.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> There is no peace, saith the LORD, unto the wicked.<br>
