 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 14</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd391.htm#009">Zeruiah</a> perceived that the king's heart was toward <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> woman, and said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning <a href="../ebd/ebd027.htm#000">apparel</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#008">anoint</a> not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And come to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, and speak on this manner unto him. So <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> put the words in her mouth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, she fell on her face to the ground, and did <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#006">obeisance</a>, and said, Help, O <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I am indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And thy <a href="../ebd/ebd162.htm#008">handmaid</a> had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other, and slew him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine <a href="../ebd/ebd162.htm#008">handmaid</a>, and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#007">heir</a> also: and so they shall quench my <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#003">coal</a> which is left, and shall not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I will give charge concerning thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And the woman of Tekoah said unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, My lord, O <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> and his <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> be guiltless.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said, Whoever saith ought unto thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Then said she, I pray thee, let the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> remember the LORD thy God, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> to destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Then the woman said, Let thine <a href="../ebd/ebd162.htm#008">handmaid</a>, I pray thee, speak one word unto my lord the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>. And he said, Say on.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God? for the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> doth speak this thing as one which is faulty, in that the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> doth not fetch home again his banished.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect any person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, it is because the people have made me afraid: and thy <a href="../ebd/ebd162.htm#008">handmaid</a> said, I will now speak unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>; it may be that the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> will perform the request of his <a href="../ebd/ebd162.htm#008">handmaid</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> For the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> will hear, to deliver his <a href="../ebd/ebd162.htm#008">handmaid</a> out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Then thine <a href="../ebd/ebd162.htm#008">handmaid</a> said, The word of my lord the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> shall now be comfortable: for as an <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of God, so is my lord the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> to discern good and bad: therefore the LORD thy God will be with thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Then the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> now speak.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said, Is not the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> with thee in all this?  And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> hath spoken: for thy servant <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a>, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thine <a href="../ebd/ebd162.htm#008">handmaid</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> To fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> done this thing: and my lord is <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a>, according to the wisdom of an <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of God, to know all things that are in the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a>, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> again.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> said, To day thy servant knoweth that I have found <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> in thy sight, my lord, O <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, in that the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> hath fulfilled the request of his servant.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> arose and went to <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#001">Geshur</a>, and brought <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face. So <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> returned to his own house, and saw not the king's face.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> But in all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> there was none to be so much praised as <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</a> of his head there was no <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#007">blemish</a> in him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end that he polled it: because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king's weight.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And unto <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was <a href="../ebd/ebd358.htm#003">Tamar</a>: she was a woman of a fair countenance.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> dwelt two full years in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and saw not the king's face.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Therefore <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> sent for <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a>, to have sent him to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>; but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time, he would not come.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he hath <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#003">barley</a> there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's servants set the field on fire.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> arose, and came to <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> unto his house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> answered <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a>, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, to say, Wherefore am I come from <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#001">Geshur</a>? it had been good for me to have been there still: now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> came to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, and told him: and when he had called for <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a>, he came to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> kissed <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a>.<br>
