 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 21</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a> slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>. And <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#005">Jehoram</a> his son reigned in his stead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And he had brethren the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd037.htm#005">Azariah</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd200.htm#003">Jehiel</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#006">Zechariah</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd037.htm#005">Azariah</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd252.htm#009">Michael</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd335.htm#005">Shephatiah</a>: all these were the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And their father gave them great gifts of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, and of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, and of precious things, with fenced cities in <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>: but the kingdom gave he to <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#005">Jehoram</a>; because he was the firstborn.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Now when <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#005">Jehoram</a> was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself, and slew all his brethren with the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, and divers also of the princes of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#005">Jehoram</a> was thirty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And he walked in the way of the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, like as did the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a>: for he had the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a> to wife: and he wrought that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Howbeit the LORD would not destroy the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, because of the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> that he had made with <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and made themselves a <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#005">Jehoram</a> went forth with his princes, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him in, and the captains of the chariots.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> unto this day. The same time also did <a href="../ebd/ebd228.htm#004">Libnah</a> revolt from under his hand; because he had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Moreover he made high places in the mountains of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> and caused the inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> to commit <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</a>, and compelled <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> thereto.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And there came a <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#005">writing</a> to him from <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> thy father, Because thou hast not walked in the ways of <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a> thy father, nor in the ways of <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> But hast walked in the way of the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and hast made <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> and the inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> to go a whoring, like to the whoredoms of the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a>, and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father's house, which were better than thyself:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Behold, with a great <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#001">plague</a> will the LORD smite thy people, and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy goods:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#004">bowels</a>, until thy <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#004">bowels</a> fall out by reason of the sickness day by day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Moreover the LORD stirred up against <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#005">Jehoram</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>, and of the Arabians, that were near the Ethiopians:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And they came up into <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and brake into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king's house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son left him, save <a href="../ebd/ebd200.htm#006">Jehoahaz</a>, the youngest of his sons.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And after all this the LORD smote him in his <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#004">bowels</a> with an incurable disease.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two years, his <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#004">bowels</a> fell out by reason of his sickness: so he died of sore diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> eight years, and departed without being desired. Howbeit they buried him in the city of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, but not in the sepulchres of the kings.<br>
