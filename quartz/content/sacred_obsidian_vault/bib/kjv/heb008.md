 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Hebrews Chapter 8</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, who is set on the right hand of the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> of the Majesty in the heavens;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> A <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</a>, and of the true <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a>, which the Lord pitched, and not man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> For every high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> For if he were on earth, he should not be a <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Who serve unto the example and <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</a> of heavenly things, as <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> was admonished of God when he was about to make the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a>: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the <a href="../ebd/ebd246.htm#002">mediator</a> of a better <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a>, which was established upon better promises.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> For if that first <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> with the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> and with the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Not according to the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>; because they continued not in my <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a>, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> For this is the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> that I will make with the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> In that he saith, A new <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a>, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away.<br>
