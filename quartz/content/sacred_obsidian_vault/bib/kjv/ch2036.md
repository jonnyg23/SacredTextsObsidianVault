 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 36</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then the people of the land took <a href="../ebd/ebd200.htm#006">Jehoahaz</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#008">Josiah</a>, and made him <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> in his father's stead in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd200.htm#006">Jehoahaz</a> was twenty and three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> put him down at <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and condemned the land in an hundred talents of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> and a <a href="../ebd/ebd357.htm#009">talent</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> made <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#000">Eliakim</a> his brother <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> over <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and turned his name to <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#001">Jehoiakim</a>. And Necho took <a href="../ebd/ebd200.htm#006">Jehoahaz</a> his brother, and carried him to <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#001">Jehoiakim</a> was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Against him came up <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#005">Nebuchadnezzar</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#005">Nebuchadnezzar</a> also carried of the vessels of the house of the LORD to <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, and put them in his <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> at <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Now the rest of the acts of <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#001">Jehoiakim</a>, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#000">Jehoiachin</a> his son reigned in his stead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#000">Jehoiachin</a> was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months and ten days in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And when the year was expired, <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#005">Nebuchadnezzar</a> sent, and brought him to <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, with the goodly vessels of the house of the LORD, and made <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</a> his brother <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> over <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</a> was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned eleven years in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God, and humbled not himself before <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> speaking from the mouth of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And he also rebelled against <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#005">Nebuchadnezzar</a>, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his <a href="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</a>, and hardened his heart from turning unto the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people, transgressed very much after all the abominations of the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a>; and polluted the house of the LORD which he had hallowed in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And the LORD God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers, rising up betimes, and sending; because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling place:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the LORD arose against his people, till there was no remedy.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Therefore he brought upon them the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd076.htm#002">Chaldees</a>, who slew their young men with the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> in the house of their <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</a>, and had no compassion upon young man or maiden, old man, or him that stooped for age: he gave them all into his hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, and of his princes; all these he brought to <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And they burnt the house of God, and brake down the wall of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And them that had escaped from the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> carried he away to <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>; where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of <a href="../ebd/ebd290.htm#009">Persia</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> To fulfil the word of the LORD by the mouth of <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a>, until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths: for as long as she lay desolate she kept <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a>, to fulfil threescore and ten years.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Now in the first year of <a href="../ebd/ebd095.htm#006">Cyrus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd290.htm#009">Persia</a>, that the word of the LORD spoken by the mouth of <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> might be accomplished, the LORD stirred up the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd095.htm#006">Cyrus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd290.htm#009">Persia</a>, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#005">writing</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Thus saith <a href="../ebd/ebd095.htm#006">Cyrus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd290.htm#009">Persia</a>, All the kingdoms of the earth hath the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> given me; and he hath charged me to build him an house in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, which is in <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>. Who is there among you of all his people?  The LORD his God be with him, and let him go up.<br>
