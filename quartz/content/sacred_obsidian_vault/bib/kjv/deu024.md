 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Deuteronomy Chapter 24</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> When a man hath taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found some uncleanness in her: then let him write her a bill of divorcement, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be another man's wife.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And if the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of divorcement, and giveth it in her hand, and sendeth her out of his house; or if the latter husband die, which took her to be his wife;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</a> before the LORD: and thou shalt not cause the land to <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> When a man hath taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war, neither shall he be charged with any business: but he shall be free at home one year, and shall cheer up his wife which he hath taken.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> No man shall take the nether or the upper millstone to <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#005">pledge</a>: for he taketh a man's life to <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#005">pledge</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> If a man be found <a href="../ebd/ebd352.htm#001">stealing</a> any of his brethren of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and maketh merchandise of him, or selleth him; then that thief shall die; and thou shalt put evil away from among you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Take heed in the <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#001">plague</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#003">leprosy</a>, that thou observe diligently, and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you: as I commanded them, so ye shall observe to do.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Remember what the LORD thy God did unto <a href="../ebd/ebd256.htm#003">Miriam</a> by the way, after that ye were come forth out of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> When thou dost lend thy brother any thing, thou shalt not go into his house to fetch his <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#005">pledge</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Thou shalt stand abroad, and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring out the <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#005">pledge</a> abroad unto thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And if the man be <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>, thou shalt not sleep with his <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#005">pledge</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> In any case thou shalt deliver him the <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#005">pledge</a> again when the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> goeth down, that he may sleep in his own raiment, and <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a> thee: and it shall be <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> unto thee before the LORD thy God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Thou shalt not oppress an hired servant that is <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> and needy, whether he be of thy brethren, or of thy strangers that are in thy land within thy gates:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> At his day thou shalt give him his hire, neither shall the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> go down upon it; for he is <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>, and setteth his heart upon it: lest he cry against thee unto the LORD, and it be <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> unto thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a>, nor of the fatherless; nor take a widow's raiment to <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#005">pledge</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> But thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee thence: therefore I command thee to do this thing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> When thou cuttest down thine <a href="../ebd/ebd165.htm#008">harvest</a> in thy field, and hast forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it: it shall be for the <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a>, for the fatherless, and for the widow: that the LORD thy God may <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a> thee in all the work of thine hands.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> When thou beatest thine <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#009">olive</a> tree, thou shalt not go over the boughs again: it shall be for the <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a>, for the fatherless, and for the widow.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#003">glean</a> it afterward: it shall be for the <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a>, for the fatherless, and for the widow.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>: therefore I command thee to do this thing.<br>
