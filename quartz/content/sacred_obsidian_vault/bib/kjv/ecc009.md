 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Ecclesiastes Chapter 9</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this, that the righteous, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a>, and their works, are in the hand of God: no man knoweth either love or <a href="../ebd/ebd167.htm#002">hatred</a> by all that is before them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> All things come alike to all: there is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</a>, and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not: as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> This is an evil among all things that are done under the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a>, that there is one event unto all: yea, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and <a href="../ebd/ebd236.htm#002">madness</a> is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for a living dog is better than a dead lion.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Also their love, and their <a href="../ebd/ebd167.htm#002">hatred</a>, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Go thy way, eat thy <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> with joy, and <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> thy <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> with a merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#007">ointment</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a>, all the days of thy vanity: for that is thy portion in this life, and in thy labour which thou takest under the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</a>, whither thou goest.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> I returned, and saw under the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a>, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> to the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a>, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil <a href="../ebd/ebd271.htm#002">net</a>, and as the birds that are caught in the <a href="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</a>; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> This wisdom have I seen also under the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a>, and it seemed great unto me:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> There was a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> against it, and besieged it, and built great <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#005">bulwarks</a> against it:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Now there was found in it a <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> The words of <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Wisdom is better than weapons of war: but one sinner destroyeth much good.<br>
