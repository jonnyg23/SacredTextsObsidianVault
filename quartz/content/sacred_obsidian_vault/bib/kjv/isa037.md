 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 37</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And it came to pass, when <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a> heard it, that he <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</a> his clothes, and covered himself with <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#001">sackcloth</a>, and went into the house of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And he sent <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#000">Eliakim</a>, who was over the household, and <a href="../ebd/ebd332.htm#009">Shebna</a> the scribe, and the elders of the priests covered with <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#001">sackcloth</a>, unto <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#007">Isaiah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#008">Amoz</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And they said unto him, Thus saith <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a>, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#005">blasphemy</a>: for the children are come to the <a href="../ebd/ebd059.htm#002">birth</a>, and there is not strength to bring forth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> It may be the LORD thy God will hear the words of <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#000">Rabshakeh</a>, whom the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</a> his master hath sent to reproach the living God, and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a> for the remnant that is left.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> So the servants of <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a> came to <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#007">Isaiah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#007">Isaiah</a> said unto them, Thus shall ye say unto your master, Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</a> have blasphemed me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> in his own land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#000">Rabshakeh</a> returned, and found the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</a> warring against <a href="../ebd/ebd228.htm#004">Libnah</a>: for he had heard that he was departed from <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#009">Lachish</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And he heard say concerning <a href="../ebd/ebd368.htm#000">Tirhakah</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd126.htm#005">Ethiopia</a>, He is come forth to make war with thee. And when he heard it, he sent messengers to <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Thus shall ye speak to <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, saying, Let not thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying, <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> shall not be given into the hand of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</a> have done to all lands by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed, as <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#009">Gozan</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd163.htm#007">Haran</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd312.htm#005">Rezeph</a>, and the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd112.htm#009">Eden</a> which were in <a href="../ebd/ebd360.htm#006">Telassar</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Where is the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd160.htm#005">Hamath</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd032.htm#003">Arphad</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of the city of <a href="../ebd/ebd327.htm#009">Sepharvaim</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd174.htm#003">Hena</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#009">Ivah</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a> received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it: and <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a> went up unto the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a> prayed unto the LORD, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> O LORD of hosts, God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, that dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth: thou hast made <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> and earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Incline thine <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a>, O LORD, and hear; open thine eyes, O LORD, and see: and hear all the words of <a href="../ebd/ebd327.htm#005">Sennacherib</a>, which hath sent to reproach the living God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Of a truth, LORD, the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</a> have laid waste all the nations, and their countries,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a>: therefore they have destroyed them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD, even thou only.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#007">Isaiah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#008">Amoz</a> sent unto <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a>, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, Whereas thou hast prayed to me against <a href="../ebd/ebd327.htm#005">Sennacherib</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> This is the word which the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#009">virgin</a>, the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a>, hath despised thee, and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> hath shaken her head at thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? even against the Holy One of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord, and hast said, By the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</a>; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice <a href="../ebd/ebd133.htm#005">fir</a> trees thereof: and I will enter into the height of his border, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#006">forest</a> of his <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#006">Carmel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> I have digged, and <a href="../ebd/ebd108.htm#007">drunk</a> water; and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Hast thou not heard long ago, how I have done it; and of ancient times, that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste defenced cities into ruinous heaps.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded: they were as the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</a> of the field, and as the green <a href="../ebd/ebd174.htm#008">herb</a>, as the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</a> on the housetops, and as <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</a> blasted before it be grown up.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is come up into mine ears, therefore will I put my <a href="../ebd/ebd181.htm#004">hook</a> in thy nose, and my <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#002">bridle</a> in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such as groweth of itself; and the second year that which springeth of the same: and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> thereof.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And the remnant that is escaped of the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> shall again take root downward, and bear <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> upward:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> For out of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a>: the <a href="../ebd/ebd388.htm#003">zeal</a> of the LORD of hosts shall do this.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</a>, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shields, nor cast a bank against it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> For I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> Then the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the LORD went forth, and smote in the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a> of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd327.htm#005">Sennacherib</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</a> departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at <a href="../ebd/ebd273.htm#006">Nineveh</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd273.htm#008">Nisroch</a> his god, that <a href="../ebd/ebd010.htm#003">Adrammelech</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd331.htm#008">Sharezer</a> his sons smote him with the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>; and they escaped into the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#004">Armenia</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#004">Esarhaddon</a> his son reigned in his stead.<br>
