 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Corinthians Chapter 10</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a>, and all passed through the sea;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And were all baptized unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a> and in the sea;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And did all eat the same spiritual meat;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And did all <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> the same spiritual <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>: for they drank of that spiritual <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">Rock</a> that followed them: and that <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">Rock</a> was <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not <a href="../ebd/ebd233.htm#005">lust</a> after evil things, as they also lusted.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>, and rose up to play.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Neither let us commit <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</a>, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Neither let us tempt <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#003">destroyer</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> There hath no <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#008">temptation</a> taken you but such as is common to man: but God is <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a>, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#008">temptation</a> also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from <a href="../ebd/ebd186.htm#007">idolatry</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> I speak as to <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> men; <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> ye what I say.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</a> of blessing which we <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a>, is it not the <a href="../ebd/ebd087.htm#004">communion</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>? The <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> which we break, is it not the <a href="../ebd/ebd087.htm#004">communion</a> of the body of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> For we being many are one <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Behold <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> after the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> What say I then? that the <a href="../ebd/ebd186.htm#006">idol</a> is any thing, or that which is offered in <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> to idols is any thing?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> But I say, that the things which the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a>, they <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#002">fellowship</a> with devils.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Ye cannot <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</a> of the Lord, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</a> of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Do we provoke the Lord to <a href="../ebd/ebd198.htm#008">jealousy</a>? are we stronger than he?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Let no man seek his own, but every man another's wealth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question for <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#006">conscience</a> sake:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> For the earth is the Lord's, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#007">fulness</a> thereof.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> If any of them that believe not bid you to a <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a>, and ye be disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#006">conscience</a> sake.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> But if any man say unto you, This is offered in <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> unto idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#006">conscience</a> sake: for the earth is the Lord's, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#007">fulness</a> thereof:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#006">Conscience</a>, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another man's <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#006">conscience</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> For if I by <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Whether therefore ye eat, or <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>, nor to the church of God:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.<br>
