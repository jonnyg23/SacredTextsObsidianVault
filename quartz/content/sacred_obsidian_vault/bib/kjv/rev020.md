 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Revelation Chapter 20</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And I saw an <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> come down from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, having the <a href="../ebd/ebd218.htm#002">key</a> of the bottomless <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a> and a great <a href="../ebd/ebd075.htm#008">chain</a> in his hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And he laid hold on the <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#000">dragon</a>, that old <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#009">serpent</a>, which is the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">Devil</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</a>, and bound him a thousand years,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And cast him into the bottomless <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a>, and shut him up, and set a <a href="../ebd/ebd325.htm#002">seal</a> upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> a thousand years.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, and shall reign with him a thousand years.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And when the thousand years are expired, <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</a> shall be loosed out of his <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, <a href="../ebd/ebd151.htm#009">Gog</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd236.htm#009">Magog</a>, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a> of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and devoured them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</a> that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#005">brimstone</a>, where the <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> and the false <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And I saw a great white <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a>, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> fled away; and there was found no place for them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and <a href="../ebd/ebd173.htm#003">hell</a> delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And death and <a href="../ebd/ebd173.htm#003">hell</a> were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.<br>
