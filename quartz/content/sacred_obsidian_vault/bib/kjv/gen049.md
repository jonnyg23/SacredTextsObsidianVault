 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Genesis Chapter 49</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>; and hearken unto <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> your father.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd311.htm#009">Reuben</a>, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#002">couch</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#002">Simeon</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#006">Levi</a> are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a wall.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Cursed be their <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, and scatter them in <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall be in the <a href="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</a> of thine enemies; thy father's children shall <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a> down before thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#006">sceptre</a> shall not depart from <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until <a href="../ebd/ebd337.htm#008">Shiloh</a> come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Binding his foal unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</a>, and his ass's colt unto the choice <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</a>; he washed his garments in <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>, and his clothes in the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of grapes:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> His eyes shall be red with <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>, and his teeth white with <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#000">milk</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#003">Zebulun</a> shall dwell at the <a href="../ebd/ebd167.htm#008">haven</a> of the sea; and he shall be for an <a href="../ebd/ebd167.htm#008">haven</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd339.htm#003">ships</a>; and his border shall be unto <a href="../ebd/ebd393.htm#000">Zidon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#002">Issachar</a> is a strong <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</a> couching down between two burdens:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#006">tribute</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#009">Dan</a> shall <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> his people, as one of the tribes of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#009">Dan</a> shall be a <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#009">serpent</a> by the way, an <a href="../ebd/ebd008.htm#005">adder</a> in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> I have waited for thy <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a>, O LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#007">Gad</a>, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Out of <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#008">Asher</a> his <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> shall be <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</a>, and he shall yield royal dainties.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#006">Naphtali</a> is a <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#000">hind</a> let loose: he giveth goodly words.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> But his <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a> abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>; (from thence is the <a href="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>:)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a> thee with blessings of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> above, blessings of the <a href="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</a> that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> hills: they shall be on the head of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>, and on the <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</a> of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a> shall ravin as a <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#001">wolf</a>: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> All these are the twelve tribes of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: and this is it that their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#006">cave</a> that is in the field of <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#008">Ephron</a> the Hittite,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> In the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#006">cave</a> that is in the field of <a href="../ebd/ebd235.htm#007">Machpelah</a>, which is before <a href="../ebd/ebd239.htm#008">Mamre</a>, in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</a>, which <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> bought with the field of <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#008">Ephron</a> the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> There they buried <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</a> his wife; there they buried <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#001">Rebekah</a> his wife; and there I buried <a href="../ebd/ebd225.htm#006">Leah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> The purchase of the field and of the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#006">cave</a> that is therein was from the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#001">Heth</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">ghost</a>, and was gathered unto his people.<br>
