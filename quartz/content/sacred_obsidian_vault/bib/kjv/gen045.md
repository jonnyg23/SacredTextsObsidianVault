 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Genesis Chapter 45</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> made himself known unto his brethren.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> heard.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> said unto his brethren, I am <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> your brother, whom ye sold into <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> For these two years hath the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a> been in the land: and yet there are five years, in the which there shall neither be <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#005">earing</a> nor <a href="../ebd/ebd165.htm#008">harvest</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>, God hath made me lord of all <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>: come down unto me, tarry not:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And thou shalt dwell in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#002">Goshen</a>, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a>; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a>, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And ye shall tell my father of all my <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's <a href="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</a>, and wept; and <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a> wept upon his <a href="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> well, and his servants.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and ye shall eat the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</a> of the land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> is your's.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> did so: and <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> gave them wagons, according to the commandment of <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, and gave them provision for the way.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a> he gave three hundred <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, and five changes of raiment.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden with the good things of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and ten she asses laden with <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> and meat for his father by the way.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And they went up out of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and came into the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> their father,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And told him, saying, <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> is yet alive, and he is governor over all the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he believed them not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And they told him all the words of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> had sent to carry him, the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> their father revived:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> said, It is enough; <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.<br>
