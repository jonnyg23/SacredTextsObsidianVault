 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Psalms Chapter 31</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed: deliver me in thy <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">Bow</a> down thine <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a> to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my strong <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a>, for an house of defence to save me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> For thou art my <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a> and my fortress; therefore for thy name's sake lead me, and guide me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Pull me out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd271.htm#002">net</a> that they have laid privily for me: for thou art my strength.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Into thine hand I commit my <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>: thou hast redeemed me, O LORD God of truth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> I will be glad and rejoice in thy <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a>: for thou hast considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a large room.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Have <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye is consumed with grief, yea, my soul and my <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did see me without fled from me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken vessel.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side: while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> But I trusted in thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> My times are in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy mercies' sake.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon thee: let the wicked be ashamed, and let them be silent in the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Oh how great is thy <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</a>, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#004">pavilion</a> from the strife of tongues.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Blessed be the LORD: for he hath shewed me his marvellous kindness in a strong city.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes: nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> O love the LORD, all ye his saints: for the LORD preserveth the <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a>, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the LORD.<br>
