 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 9</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And it came to pass, when <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> had finished the building of the house of the LORD, and the king's house, and all Solomon's desire which he was pleased to do,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> That the LORD appeared to <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> the second time, as he had appeared unto him at <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#002">Gibeon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And the LORD said unto him, I have heard thy <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a> and thy supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And if thou wilt walk before me, as <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and my judgments:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Then I will establish the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> of thy kingdom upon <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> for ever, as I promised to <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> But if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your children, and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> them:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Then will I cut off <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> shall be a <a href="../ebd/ebd301.htm#002">proverb</a> and a byword among all people:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And at this house, which is high, every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#005">hiss</a>; and they shall say, Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and to this house?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And they shall answer, Because they forsook the LORD their God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and have taken hold upon other gods, and have worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath the LORD brought upon them all this evil.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> had built the two houses, the house of the LORD, and the king's house,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> (Now <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#003">Hiram</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd374.htm#001">Tyre</a> had furnished <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> with <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</a> trees and <a href="../ebd/ebd133.htm#005">fir</a> trees, and with <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, according to all his desire,) that then <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> gave <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#003">Hiram</a> twenty cities in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#003">Hiram</a> came out from <a href="../ebd/ebd374.htm#001">Tyre</a> to see the cities which <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> had given him; and they pleased him not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And he said, What cities are these which thou hast given me, my brother? And he called them the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#001">Cabul</a> unto this day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#003">Hiram</a> sent to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> sixscore talents of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And this is the reason of the <a href="../ebd/ebd228.htm#001">levy</a> which <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> raised; for to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#004">Millo</a>, and the wall of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd169.htm#006">Hazor</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd246.htm#004">Megiddo</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#004">Gezer</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> For <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> had gone up, and taken <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#004">Gezer</a>, and burnt it with fire, and slain the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#007">Canaanites</a> that dwelt in the city, and given it for a present unto his daughter, Solomon's wife.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> built <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#004">Gezer</a>, and Bethhoron the nether,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd038.htm#006">Baalath</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd357.htm#004">Tadmor</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, in the land,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And all the cities of store that <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> had, and cities for his chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> desired to build in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and in <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</a>, and in all the land of his dominion.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And all the people that were left of the <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#006">Amorites</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#006">Hittites</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd290.htm#006">Perizzites</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#007">Hivites</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd199.htm#004">Jebusites</a>, which were not of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those did <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd228.htm#001">levy</a> a <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#006">tribute</a> of bondservice unto this day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> But of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> did <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> make no bondmen: but they were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> These were the chief of the officers that were over Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, which bare rule over the people that wrought in the work.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> unto her house which <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> had built for her: then did he build <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#004">Millo</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And three times in a year did <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> which he built unto the LORD, and he burnt <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a> upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> that was before the LORD. So he finished the house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> made a navy of <a href="../ebd/ebd339.htm#003">ships</a> in Eziongeber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#003">Hiram</a> sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And they came to <a href="../ebd/ebd279.htm#007">Ophir</a>, and fetched from thence <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a>.<br>
