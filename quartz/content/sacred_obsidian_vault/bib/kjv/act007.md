 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Acts Chapter 7</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then said the high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, Are these things so?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> appeared unto our father <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, when he was in <a href="../ebd/ebd251.htm#003">Mesopotamia</a>, before he dwelt in <a href="../ebd/ebd078.htm#001">Charran</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall shew thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in <a href="../ebd/ebd078.htm#001">Charran</a>: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And God spake on this <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a>, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#002">bondage</a>, and entreat them evil four hundred years.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And the nation to whom they shall be in <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#002">bondage</a> will I <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a>, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And he gave him the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</a>: and so <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> begat <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a>, and circumcised him the eighth day; and <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a> begat <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>; and <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> begat the twelve patriarchs.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> into <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>: but God was with him,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And delivered him out of all his <a href="../ebd/ebd011.htm#006">afflictions</a>, and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>; and he made him governor over <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> and all his house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Now there came a <a href="../ebd/ebd099.htm#005">dearth</a> over all the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> and Chanaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> But when <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> heard that there was <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, he sent out our fathers first.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And at the second time <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> was made known to his brethren; and Joseph's kindred was made known unto <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Then sent <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>, and called his father <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> to him, and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> went down into <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and died, he, and our fathers,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And were carried over into <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#007">Sychem</a>, and laid in the <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</a> that <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> bought for a sum of money of the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd120.htm#002">Emmor</a> the father of <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#007">Sychem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn to <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, the people grew and multiplied in <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Till another <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> arose, which knew not <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and evil entreated our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might not live.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> In which time <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> was born, and was exceeding fair, and nourished up in his father's house three months:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> For he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them: but they understood not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> over us?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Then fled <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> at this saying, and was a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a> in the land of Madian, where he begat two sons.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> Sina an <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the Lord in a flame of fire in a <a href="../ebd/ebd067.htm#000">bush</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> When <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to behold it, the voice of the LORD came unto him,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> Saying, I am the God of thy fathers, the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, and the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a>, and the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>. Then <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> trembled, and durst not behold.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for the place where thou standest is holy ground.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> This <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a>? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> which appeared to him in the <a href="../ebd/ebd067.htm#000">bush</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and in the Red sea, and in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> forty years.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> This is that <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, which said unto the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, A <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> This is he, that was in the church in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> with the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> which spake to him in the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> Sina, and with our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give unto us:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back again into <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> Saying unto <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a>, Make us gods to go before us: for as for this <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, which brought us out of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, we wot not what is become of him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> And they made a <a href="../ebd/ebd069.htm#004">calf</a> in those days, and offered <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd186.htm#006">idol</a>, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> Then God turned, and gave them up to <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> Yea, ye took up the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#000">Moloch</a>, and the star of your god <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#006">Remphan</a>, figures which ye made to <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> them: and I will carry you away beyond <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> Our fathers had the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, as he had appointed, speaking unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> Which also our fathers that came after brought in with <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> into the possession of the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>, whom God drave out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="046">46</a> Who found favour before God, and desired to find a <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a> for the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="047">47</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> built him an house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="048">48</a> Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="049">49</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">Heaven</a> is my <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a>, and earth is my <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#009">footstool</a>: what house will ye build me? saith the Lord: or what is the place of my rest?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="050">50</a> Hath not my hand made all these things?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="051">51</a> Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a>: as your fathers did, so do ye.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="052">52</a> Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="053">53</a> Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="054">54</a> When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="055">55</a> But he, being full of the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a>, looked up stedfastly into <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and saw the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of God, and <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> standing on the right hand of God,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="056">56</a> And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="057">57</a> Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="058">58</a> And cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose name was <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="059">59</a> And they stoned <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#002">Stephen</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd069.htm#007">calling</a> upon God, and saying, Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, receive my <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="060">60</a> And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.<br>
