 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Psalms Chapter 39</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#002">bridle</a>, while the wicked is before me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> I was <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#002">dumb</a> with silence, I held my peace, even from good; and my sorrow was stirred.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned: then spake I with my tongue,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is: that I may know how frail I am.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Behold, thou hast made my days as an <a href="../ebd/ebd162.htm#006">handbreadth</a>; and mine age is as nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity. <a href="../ebd/ebd326.htm#008">Selah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the reproach of the foolish.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> I was <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#002">dumb</a>, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of thine hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#005">moth</a>: surely every man is vanity. <a href="../ebd/ebd326.htm#008">Selah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Hear my <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a>, O LORD, and give <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a> unto my cry; hold not thy peace at my tears: for I am a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a> with thee, and a sojourner, as all my fathers were.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and be no more.<br>
