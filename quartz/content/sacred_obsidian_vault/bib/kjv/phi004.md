 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Philippians Chapter 4</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</a>, so stand <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a> in the Lord, my dearly beloved.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> I beseech <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#000">Euodias</a>, and beseech <a href="../ebd/ebd355.htm#000">Syntyche</a>, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which laboured with me in the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a>, with <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#006">Clement</a> also, and with other my fellowlabourers, whose names are in the book of life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a> and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> I can do all things through <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> which strengtheneth me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a>, when I departed from <a href="../ebd/ebd235.htm#003">Macedonia</a>, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> For even in <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#000">Thessalonica</a> ye sent once and again unto my necessity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Not because I desire a <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</a>: but I desire <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> that may abound to your account.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of <a href="../ebd/ebd122.htm#001">Epaphroditus</a> the things which were sent from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> acceptable, wellpleasing to God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> by <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Now unto God and our Father be <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> for ever and ever. <a href="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Salute every saint in <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>. The brethren which are with me greet you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar's household.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> of our Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> be with you all. <a href="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</a>.<br>
