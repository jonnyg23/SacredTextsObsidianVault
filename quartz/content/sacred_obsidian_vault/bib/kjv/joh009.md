 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: John Chapter 9</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And as <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> passed by, he saw a man which was <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a> from his <a href="../ebd/ebd059.htm#002">birth</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>, this man, or his parents, that he was born <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#004">clay</a> of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a> man with the <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#004">clay</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a>, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> He answered and said, A man that is called <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> made <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#004">clay</a>, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> They brought to the <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a> him that aforetime was <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And it was the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> day when <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> made the <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#004">clay</a>, and opened his eyes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Then again the <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a> also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#004">clay</a> upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Therefore said some of the <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a>, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> They say unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a> man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a>, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a>? how then doth he now see?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, he should be put out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Then again called they the man that was <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a>, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a>, now I see.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his <a href="../ebd/ebd104.htm#003">disciple</a>; but we are Moses' disciples.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> We know that God spake unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>: as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#003">worshipper</a> of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> And some of the <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a> which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a> also?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> said unto them, If ye were <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a>, ye should have no <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>: but now ye say, We see; therefore your <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> remaineth.<br>
