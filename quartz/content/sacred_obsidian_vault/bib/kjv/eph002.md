 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Ephesians Chapter 2</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</a> of the power of the air, the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> that now worketh in the children of disobedience:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Among whom also we all had our <a href="../ebd/ebd089.htm#001">conversation</a> in times past in the lusts of our <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, fulfilling the desires of the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> But God, who is rich in <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a>, for his great love wherewith he loved us,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, (by <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> ye are saved;)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> in his kindness toward us through <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> For by <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</a> of God:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Not of works, lest any man should boast.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> For we are his workmanship, created in <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the <a href="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">Circumcision</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> made by hands;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> That at that time ye were without <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, being aliens from the commonwealth of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> But now in <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Having abolished in his <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd121.htm#003">enmity</a>, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#000">cross</a>, having slain the <a href="../ebd/ebd121.htm#003">enmity</a> thereby:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> For through him we both have access by one <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> unto the Father.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> himself being the chief corner <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> in the Lord:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> In whom ye also are builded together for an <a href="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</a> of God through the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a>.<br>
