 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Hebrews Chapter 3</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly <a href="../ebd/ebd069.htm#007">calling</a>, consider the <a href="../ebd/ebd026.htm#008">Apostle</a> and High <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">Priest</a> of our profession, <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Who was <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a> to him that appointed him, as also <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> was <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a> in all his house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> For this man was counted worthy of more <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> than <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> verily was <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a> in all his house, as a servant, for a <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</a> of those things which were to be spoken after;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a> the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Wherefore (as the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a> saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#008">temptation</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Wherefore I was grieved with that <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a>, and said, They do alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> For we are made partakers of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> by <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.<br>
