 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Joshua Chapter 7</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> But the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> committed a trespass in the accursed thing: for <a href="../ebd/ebd006.htm#006">Achan</a>, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#007">Carmi</a>, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd385.htm#008">Zabdi</a>, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd391.htm#001">Zerah</a>, of the <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, took of the accursed thing: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> of the LORD was kindled against the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> sent men from <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#008">Jericho</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</a>, which is beside Bethaven, on the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</a>, and spake unto them, saying, Go up and view the country. And the men went up and viewed <a href="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And they returned to <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a>, and said unto him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite <a href="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</a>; and make not all the people to labour thither; for they are but few.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</a> smote of them about thirty and six men: for they chased them from before the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> even unto <a href="../ebd/ebd332.htm#008">Shebarim</a>, and smote them in the going down: wherefore the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</a> his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of the LORD until the eventide, he and the elders of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and put <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a> upon their heads.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> said, Alas, O LORD God, wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a>, to deliver us into the hand of the <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#006">Amorites</a>, to destroy us? would to God we had been content, and dwelt on the other side <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a>!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> O LORD, what shall I say, when <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> turneth their backs before their enemies!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> For the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#007">Canaanites</a> and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it, and shall environ us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do unto thy great name?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a>, Get thee up; wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have put it even among their own stuff.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Therefore the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> could not stand before their enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because they were accursed: neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed from among you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow: for thus saith the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, There is an accursed thing in the midst of thee, O <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the accursed thing from among you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes: and it shall be, that the <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</a> which the LORD taketh shall come according to the families thereof; and the family which the LORD shall take shall come by households; and the household which the LORD shall take shall come man by man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And it shall be, that he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath: because he hath transgressed the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> of the LORD, and because he hath wrought folly in <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> rose up early in the morning, and brought <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> by their tribes; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> was taken:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And he brought the family of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>; and he took the family of the Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and <a href="../ebd/ebd385.htm#008">Zabdi</a> was taken:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And he brought his household man by man; and <a href="../ebd/ebd006.htm#006">Achan</a>, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#007">Carmi</a>, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd385.htm#008">Zabdi</a>, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd391.htm#001">Zerah</a>, of the <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, was taken.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd006.htm#006">Achan</a>, My son, give, I pray thee, <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> to the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and make <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#003">confession</a> unto him; and tell me now what thou hast done; hide it not from me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd006.htm#006">Achan</a> answered <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a>, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and thus and thus have I done:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, and a wedge of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> under it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> sent messengers, and they ran unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a>; and, behold, it was hid in his <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> under it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And they took them out of the midst of the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a>, and brought them unto <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a>, and unto all the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and laid them out before the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a>, and all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> with him, took <a href="../ebd/ebd006.htm#006">Achan</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd391.htm#001">Zerah</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, and the garment, and the wedge of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>, and his <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a>, and all that he had: and they brought them unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd007.htm#000">Achor</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> said, Why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall trouble thee this day. And all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And they raised over him a great <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</a> of stones unto this day. So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>. Wherefore the name of that place was called, The <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd007.htm#000">Achor</a>, unto this day.<br>
