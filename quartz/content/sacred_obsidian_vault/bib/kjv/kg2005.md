 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 5</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now <a href="../ebd/ebd263.htm#009">Naaman</a>, captain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</a>, was a great man with his master, and honourable, because by him the LORD had given deliverance unto <a href="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</a>: he was also a mighty man in valour, but he was a leper.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</a> out of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> a little maid; and she waited on Naaman's wife.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord were with the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> that is in <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a>! for he would recover him of his <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#003">leprosy</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</a> said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, and six thousand <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, and ten changes of raiment.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And he brought the letter to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, saying, Now when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have therewith sent <a href="../ebd/ebd263.htm#009">Naaman</a> my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him of his <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#003">leprosy</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And it came to pass, when the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> had read the letter, that he <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</a> his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#003">leprosy</a>? wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And it was so, when <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</a> the man of God had heard that the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> had <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</a> his clothes, that he sent to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, saying, Wherefore hast thou <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</a> thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd263.htm#009">Naaman</a> came with his horses and with his <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</a>, and stood at the door of the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</a> sent a <a href="../ebd/ebd251.htm#005">messenger</a> unto him, saying, Go and wash in <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> times, and thy <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd263.htm#009">Naaman</a> was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the LORD his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Are not <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#005">Abana</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#009">Pharpar</a>, rivers of <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</a>, better than all the waters of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>? may I not wash in them, and be <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</a>? So he turned and went away in a rage.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My father, if the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Then went he down, and dipped himself <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> times in <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a>, according to the saying of the man of God: and his <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> came again like unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> of a little child, and he was <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: now therefore, I pray thee, take a blessing of thy servant.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> But he said, As the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take it; but he refused.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd263.htm#009">Naaman</a> said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given to thy servant two mules' <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</a> of earth? for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> nor <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> unto other gods, but unto the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> In this thing the LORD <a href="../ebd/ebd285.htm#001">pardon</a> thy servant, that when my master goeth into the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#005">Rimmon</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a> myself in the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#005">Rimmon</a>: when I <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a> down myself in the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#005">Rimmon</a>, the LORD <a href="../ebd/ebd285.htm#001">pardon</a> thy servant in this thing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#004">Gehazi</a>, the servant of <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</a> the man of God, said, Behold, my master hath spared <a href="../ebd/ebd263.htm#009">Naaman</a> this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: but, as the LORD liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#004">Gehazi</a> followed after <a href="../ebd/ebd263.htm#009">Naaman</a>. And when <a href="../ebd/ebd263.htm#009">Naaman</a> saw him running after him, he lighted down from the <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</a> to meet him, and said, Is all well?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And he said, All is well. My master hath sent me, saying, Behold, even now there be come to me from <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a> two young men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray thee, a <a href="../ebd/ebd357.htm#009">talent</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, and two changes of garments.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd263.htm#009">Naaman</a> said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> in two bags, with two changes of garments, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bare them before him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the house: and he let the men go, and they departed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> But he went in, and stood before his master. And <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</a> said unto him, Whence comest thou, <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#004">Gehazi</a>? And he said, Thy servant went no whither.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And he said unto him, Went not mine heart with thee, when the man turned again from his <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</a> to meet thee? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#003">leprosy</a> therefore of <a href="../ebd/ebd263.htm#009">Naaman</a> shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#000">snow</a>.<br>
