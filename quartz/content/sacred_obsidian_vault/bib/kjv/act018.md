 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Acts Chapter 18</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> After these things <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> departed from <a href="../ebd/ebd036.htm#003">Athens</a>, and came to <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#002">Corinth</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And found a certain <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#004">Jew</a> named <a href="../ebd/ebd027.htm#006">Aquila</a>, born in <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#003">Pontus</a>, lately come from <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#004">Italy</a>, with his wife <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#005">Priscilla</a>; (because that <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#003">Claudius</a> had commanded all Jews to depart from <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#007">Rome</a>:) and came unto them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And he reasoned in the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</a> every <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a>, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd343.htm#004">Silas</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd367.htm#001">Timotheus</a> were come from <a href="../ebd/ebd235.htm#003">Macedonia</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> was pressed in the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>, and testified to the Jews that <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> was <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and said unto them, Your <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> be upon your own heads; I am <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</a>; from henceforth I will go unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man's house, named <a href="../ebd/ebd215.htm#000">Justus</a>, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#009">Crispus</a>, the chief ruler of the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</a>, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Then spake the Lord to <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> in the night by a <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a>, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd142.htm#004">Gallio</a> was the <a href="../ebd/ebd101.htm#008">deputy</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd006.htm#004">Achaia</a>, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a>, and brought him to the judgment seat,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Saying, This fellow persuadeth men to <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> God contrary to the law.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> was now about to open his mouth, <a href="../ebd/ebd142.htm#004">Gallio</a> said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked <a href="../ebd/ebd228.htm#002">lewdness</a>, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for I will be no <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> of such matters.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And he drave them from the judgment seat.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Then all the Greeks took <a href="../ebd/ebd348.htm#009">Sosthenes</a>, the chief ruler of the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</a>, and beat him before the judgment seat. And <a href="../ebd/ebd142.htm#004">Gallio</a> cared for none of those things.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into <a href="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</a>, and with him <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#005">Priscilla</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd027.htm#006">Aquila</a>; having shorn his head in <a href="../ebd/ebd075.htm#001">Cenchrea</a>: for he had a vow.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And he came to <a href="../ebd/ebd122.htm#007">Ephesus</a>, and left them there: but he himself entered into the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</a>, and reasoned with the Jews.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented not;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a> that cometh in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from <a href="../ebd/ebd122.htm#007">Ephesus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And when he had landed at <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#003">Caesarea</a>, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to <a href="../ebd/ebd025.htm#001">Antioch</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#004">Galatia</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#006">Phrygia</a> in order, strengthening all the disciples.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And a certain <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#004">Jew</a> named <a href="../ebd/ebd026.htm#006">Apollos</a>, born at <a href="../ebd/ebd017.htm#001">Alexandria</a>, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to <a href="../ebd/ebd122.htm#007">Ephesus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And he began to speak boldly in the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</a>: whom when <a href="../ebd/ebd027.htm#006">Aquila</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#005">Priscilla</a> had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And when he was disposed to pass into <a href="../ebd/ebd006.htm#004">Achaia</a>, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, shewing by the scriptures that <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> was <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
