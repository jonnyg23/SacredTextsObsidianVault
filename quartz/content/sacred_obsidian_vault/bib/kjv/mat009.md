 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Matthew Chapter 9</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his own city.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the <a href="../ebd/ebd283.htm#004">palsy</a>, lying on a bed: and <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> seeing their faith said unto the sick of the <a href="../ebd/ebd283.htm#004">palsy</a>; Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And, behold, certain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</a> said within themselves, This man blasphemeth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> For whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and walk?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (then saith he to the sick of the <a href="../ebd/ebd283.htm#004">palsy</a>,) Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And he arose, and departed to his house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> But when the multitudes saw it, they marvelled, and glorified God, which had given such power unto men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And as <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named <a href="../ebd/ebd244.htm#003">Matthew</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</a> at the receipt of <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#008">custom</a>: and he saith unto him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And it came to pass, as <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And when the <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a> saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> But when <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> heard that, he said unto them, They that be whole need not a <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#000">physician</a>, but they that are sick.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a>, and not <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a>: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#008">repentance</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a> oft, but thy disciples <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a> not?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber <a href="../ebd/ebd261.htm#004">mourn</a>, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</a> is made worse.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Neither do men put new <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> into old bottles: else the bottles break, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> runneth out, and the bottles perish: but they put new <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> into new bottles, and both are preserved.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> twelve years, came behind him, and touched the <a href="../ebd/ebd173.htm#008">hem</a> of his garment:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> came into the ruler's house, and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> He said unto them, Give place: for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand, and the maid arose.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> departed thence, two <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a> men followed him, crying, and saying, Thou son of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, have <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> on us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And when he was come into the house, the <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a> men came to him: and <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said unto him, Yea, Lord.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And their eyes were opened; and <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> straitly charged them, saying, See that no man know it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all that country.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> As they went out, behold, they brought to him a <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#002">dumb</a> man possessed with a <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And when the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</a> was cast out, the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#002">dumb</a> spake: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> But the <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a> said, He casteth out devils through the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</a> of the devils.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> went about all the cities and <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#003">villages</a>, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a> of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a> having no <a href="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> Then saith he unto his disciples, The <a href="../ebd/ebd165.htm#008">harvest</a> truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> Pray ye therefore the Lord of the <a href="../ebd/ebd165.htm#008">harvest</a>, that he will send forth labourers into his <a href="../ebd/ebd165.htm#008">harvest</a>.<br>
