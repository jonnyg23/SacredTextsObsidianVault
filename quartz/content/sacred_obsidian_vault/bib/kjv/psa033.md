 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Psalms Chapter 33</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous: for praise is comely for the upright.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Praise the LORD with <a href="../ebd/ebd165.htm#001">harp</a>: sing unto him with the <a href="../ebd/ebd301.htm#006">psaltery</a> and an instrument of ten strings.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> For the word of the LORD is right; and all his works are done in truth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> He loveth <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> and judgment: the earth is full of the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</a> of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> of them by the breath of his mouth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</a>: he layeth up the depth in storehouses.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> The LORD bringeth the counsel of the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a> to nought: he maketh the devices of the people of none effect.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD; and the people whom he hath <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> for his own inheritance.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> The LORD looketh from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>; he beholdeth all the sons of men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> From the place of his <a href="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</a> he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their works.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> There is no <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> saved by the multitude of an <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a>: a mighty man is not delivered by much strength.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> An horse is a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver any by his great strength.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he is our help and our <a href="../ebd/ebd337.htm#001">shield</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Let thy <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a>, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in thee.<br>
