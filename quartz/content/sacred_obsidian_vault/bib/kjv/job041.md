 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 41</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Canst thou draw out <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#007">leviathan</a> with an <a href="../ebd/ebd181.htm#004">hook</a>? or his tongue with a <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#000">cord</a> which thou lettest down?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Canst thou put an <a href="../ebd/ebd181.htm#004">hook</a> into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#006">thorn</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft words unto thee?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Will he make a <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Wilt thou play with him as with a <a href="../ebd/ebd059.htm#000">bird</a>? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Shall the companions make a <a href="../ebd/ebd043.htm#006">banquet</a> of him? shall they part him among the merchants?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with <a href="../ebd/ebd134.htm#005">fish</a> spears?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him? whatsoever is under the whole <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> is mine.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to him with his double <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#002">bridle</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Who can open the <a href="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</a> of his face? his teeth are terrible round about.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close <a href="../ebd/ebd325.htm#002">seal</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> In his <a href="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</a> remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> The flakes of his <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> His heart is as firm as a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a>; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#009">dart</a>, nor the <a href="../ebd/ebd156.htm#006">habergeon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> He esteemeth <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a> as <a href="../ebd/ebd352.htm#000">straw</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a> as rotten <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> He maketh the <a href="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#008">boil</a> like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#007">ointment</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the <a href="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</a> to be hoary.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> He beholdeth all high things: he is a <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> over all the children of pride.<br>
