 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Romans Chapter 4</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> What shall we say then that <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> our father, as pertaining to the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, hath found?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> For if <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> were justified by works, he hath whereof to <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>; but not before God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> For what saith the <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#005">scripture</a>? <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> believed God, and it was counted unto him for <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a>, but of <a href="../ebd/ebd099.htm#009">debt</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Even as <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> without works,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Cometh this blessedness then upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</a> only, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> for <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> How was it then reckoned? when he was in <a href="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</a>, or in uncircumcision? Not in <a href="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</a>, but in uncircumcision.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And he received the sign of <a href="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</a>, a <a href="../ebd/ebd325.htm#002">seal</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> might be imputed unto them also:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And the father of <a href="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</a> to them who are not of the <a href="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</a> only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, which he had being yet uncircumcised.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> For the promise, that he should be the <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#007">heir</a> of the world, was not to <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, or to his seed, through the law, but through the <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> of faith.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a>; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>; who is the father of us all,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> (As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> to God;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And therefore it was imputed to him for <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> our Lord from the dead;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our <a href="../ebd/ebd214.htm#009">justification</a>.<br>
