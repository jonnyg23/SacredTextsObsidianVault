 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 42</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then all the captains of the <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#000">forces</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd208.htm#009">Johanan</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd215.htm#007">Kareah</a>, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even unto the greatest, came near,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>, Let, we beseech thee, our supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the LORD thy God, even for all this remnant; (for we are left but a few of many, as thine eyes do behold us:)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> That the LORD thy God may shew us the way wherein we may walk, and the thing that we may do.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> said unto them, I have heard you; behold, I will pray unto the LORD your God according to your words; and it shall come to pass, that whatsoever thing the LORD shall answer you, I will declare it unto you; I will keep nothing back from you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Then they said to <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a>, The LORD be a true and <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> between us, if we do not even according to all things for the which the LORD thy God shall send thee to us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice of the LORD our God, to whom we send thee; that it may be well with us, when we obey the voice of the LORD our God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the LORD came unto <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Then called he <a href="../ebd/ebd208.htm#009">Johanan</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd215.htm#007">Kareah</a>, and all the captains of the <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#000">forces</a> which were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you, and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up: for I repent me of the evil that I have done unto you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Be not afraid of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, of whom ye are afraid; be not afraid of him, saith the LORD: for I am with you to save you, and to deliver you from his hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And I will shew mercies unto you, that he may have <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> upon you, and cause you to return to your own land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, neither obey the voice of the LORD your God,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Saying, No; but we will go into the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>; and there will we dwell:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And now therefore hear the word of the LORD, ye remnant of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>; Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; If ye wholly set your faces to enter into <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and go to sojourn there;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Then it shall come to pass, that the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, which ye feared, shall overtake you there in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a>, whereof ye were afraid, shall follow close after you there in <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>; and there ye shall die.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> to sojourn there; they shall die by the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, by the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a>, and by the pestilence: and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; As mine <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> and my <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</a> hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>; so shall my <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</a> be poured forth upon you, when ye shall enter into <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>: and ye shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</a>, and a reproach; and ye shall see this place no more.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> The LORD hath said concerning you, O ye remnant of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>; Go ye not into <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>: know certainly that I have admonished you this day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> For ye dissembled in your hearts, when ye sent me unto the LORD your God, saying, Pray for us unto the LORD our God; and according unto all that the LORD our God shall say, so declare unto us, and we will do it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And now I have this day declared it to you; but ye have not obeyed the voice of the LORD your God, nor any thing for the which he hath sent me unto you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, by the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a>, and by the pestilence, in the place whither ye desire to go and to sojourn.<br>
