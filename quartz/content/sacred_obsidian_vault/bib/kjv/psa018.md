 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Psalms Chapter 18</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> The LORD is my <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a>, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#000">buckler</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd182.htm#003">horn</a> of my <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a>, and my high tower.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> The sorrows of <a href="../ebd/ebd173.htm#003">hell</a> compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>, and my cry came before him, even into his ears.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a> was under his feet.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And he rode upon a <a href="../ebd/ebd079.htm#003">cherub</a>, and did <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#004">fly</a>: yea, he did <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#004">fly</a> upon the wings of the wind.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> He made <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a> his secret place; his <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#004">pavilion</a> round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed, <a href="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</a> stones and coals of fire.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; <a href="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</a> stones and coals of fire.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Yea, he sent out his <a href="../ebd/ebd032.htm#005">arrows</a>, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> The LORD rewarded me according to my <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> For thou wilt light my <a href="../ebd/ebd071.htm#000">candle</a>: the LORD my God will enlighten my <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he is a <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#000">buckler</a> to all those that trust in him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> For who is God save the LORD? or who is a <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a> save our God?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> He maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and setteth me upon my high places.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> He teacheth my hands to war, so that a <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#000">steel</a> is broken by mine arms.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> Thou hast also given me the <a href="../ebd/ebd337.htm#001">shield</a> of thy <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a>: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the LORD, but he answered them not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> Then did I beat them small as the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a> before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and thou hast made me the head of the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a>: a people whom I have not known shall serve me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="046">46</a> The LORD liveth; and blessed be my <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a>; and let the God of my <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a> be exalted.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="047">47</a> It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="048">48</a> He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="049">49</a> Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a>, and sing praises unto thy name.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="050">50</a> Great deliverance giveth he to his <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>; and sheweth <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> to his anointed, to <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, and to his seed for evermore.<br>
