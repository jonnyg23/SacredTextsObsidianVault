 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Corinthians Chapter 5</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> It is reported commonly that there is <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</a> among you, and such <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</a> as is not so much as named among the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>, that one should have his father's wife.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> For I verily, as absent in body, but present in <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done this deed,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> In the name of our Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, when ye are gathered together, and my <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>, with the power of our Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> To deliver such an one unto <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</a> for the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, that the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> may be saved in the day of the Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#000">leaven</a> leaveneth the whole lump?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Purge out therefore the old <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#000">leaven</a>, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> our <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</a> is sacrificed for us:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Therefore let us keep the <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a>, not with old <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#000">leaven</a>, neither with the <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#000">leaven</a> of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> of sincerity and truth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> For what have I to do to <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> them also that are without? do not ye <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> them that are within?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.<br>
