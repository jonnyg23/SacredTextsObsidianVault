 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Romans Chapter 6</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> What shall we say then? Shall we continue in <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>, that <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> may abound?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>, live any longer therein?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> were baptized into his death?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> was raised up from the dead by the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> For he that is dead is freed from <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Now if we be dead with <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, we believe that we shall also live with him:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Knowing that <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> For in that he died, he died unto <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>, but alive unto God through <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> our Lord.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Let not <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> unto God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> For <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> What then? shall we <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>, because we are not under the law, but under <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a>? God forbid.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> unto death, or of obedience unto <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Being then made free from <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>, ye became the servants of <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd180.htm#006">holiness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> For when ye were the servants of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>, ye were free from <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> What <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed?  for the end of those things is death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> But now being made free from <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>, and become servants to God, ye have your <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd180.htm#006">holiness</a>, and the end <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> For the <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#004">wages</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> is death; but the <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</a> of God is eternal life through <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> our Lord.<br>
