 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 21</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then came <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd274.htm#003">Nob</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd014.htm#004">Ahimelech</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd014.htm#004">Ahimelech</a> was afraid at the meeting of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, and said unto him, Why art thou alone, and no man with thee?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd014.htm#004">Ahimelech</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, The <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed my servants to such and such a place.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Now therefore what is under thine hand? give me five loaves of <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> in mine hand, or what there is present.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> answered <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, and said, There is no common <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> under mine hand, but there is hallowed <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> answered the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, and said unto him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> is in a manner common, yea, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> So the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> gave him hallowed <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>: for there was no <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> there but the <a href="../ebd/ebd336.htm#008">shewbread</a>, that was taken from before the LORD, to put hot <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> in the day when it was taken away.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Now a certain man of the servants of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> was there that day, detained before the LORD; and his name was <a href="../ebd/ebd105.htm#006">Doeg</a>, an Edomite, the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd014.htm#004">Ahimelech</a>, And is there not here under thine hand spear or <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>? for I have neither brought my <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> said, The <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#005">Goliath</a> the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd114.htm#002">Elah</a>, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the <a href="../ebd/ebd122.htm#008">ephod</a>: if thou wilt take that, take it: for there is no other save that here. And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> said, There is none like that; give it me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> arose and fled that day for fear of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, and went to <a href="../ebd/ebd006.htm#008">Achish</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#009">Gath</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And the servants of <a href="../ebd/ebd006.htm#008">Achish</a> said unto him, Is not this <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> hath slain his <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> his ten <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of <a href="../ebd/ebd006.htm#008">Achish</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#009">Gath</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the <a href="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a>, and let his spittle fall down upon his <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#000">beard</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd006.htm#008">Achish</a> unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad: wherefore then have ye brought him to me?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Have I need of mad men, that ye have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house?<br>
