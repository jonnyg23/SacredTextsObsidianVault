 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Exodus Chapter 7</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, See, I have made thee a god to <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a> thy brother shall be thy <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a> thy brother shall speak unto <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, that he send the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> out of his land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand upon <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, out of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> by great judgments.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch forth mine hand upon <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and bring out the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> from among them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a> did as the LORD commanded them, so did they.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> was fourscore years old, and <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a> fourscore and three years old, when they spake unto <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And the LORD spake unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> and unto <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> When <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a <a href="../ebd/ebd256.htm#002">miracle</a> for you: then thou shalt say unto <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a>, Take thy rod, and cast it before <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, and it shall become a <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#009">serpent</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a> went in unto <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, and they did so as the LORD had commanded: and <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a> cast down his rod before <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, and before his servants, and it became a <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#009">serpent</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> also called the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> men and the sorcerers: now the <a href="../ebd/ebd236.htm#007">magicians</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, they also did in like manner with their <a href="../ebd/ebd120.htm#004">enchantments</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, Pharaoh's heart is hardened, he refuseth to let the people go.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Get thee unto <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against he come; and the rod which was turned to a <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#009">serpent</a> shalt thou take in thine hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And thou shalt say unto him, The LORD God of the <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#001">Hebrews</a> hath sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>: and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I am the LORD: behold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd134.htm#005">fish</a> that is in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> of the water of the river.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And the LORD spake unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, Say unto <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a>, Take thy rod, and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, upon their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water, that they may become <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>; and that there may be <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> throughout all the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, both in vessels of <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a>, and in vessels of <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a> did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd134.htm#005">fish</a> that was in the river died; and the river stank, and the Egyptians could not <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> of the water of the river; and there was <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> throughout all the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd236.htm#007">magicians</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> did so with their <a href="../ebd/ebd120.htm#004">enchantments</a>: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the LORD had said.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> turned and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to this also.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>; for they could not <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> of the water of the river.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten the river.<br>
