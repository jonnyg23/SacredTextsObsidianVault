 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Micah Chapter 2</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And they covet fields, and take them by violence; and houses, and take them away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks; neither shall ye go haughtily: for this time is evil.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> In that day shall one take up a <a href="../ebd/ebd284.htm#003">parable</a> against you, and lament with a doleful <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#005">lamentation</a>, and say, We be utterly spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed it from me! turning away he hath divided our fields.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#000">cord</a> by lot in the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a> of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Prophesy ye not, say they to them that prophesy: they shall not prophesy to them, that they shall not take shame.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> O thou that art named the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, is the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> of the LORD straitened? are these his doings? do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye taken away my <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy you, even with a sore <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> If a man walking in the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> and falsehood do lie, saying, I will prophesy unto thee of <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> and of strong <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>; he shall even be the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> of this people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> I will surely assemble, O <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; I will put them together as the <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#009">Bozrah</a>, as the flock in the midst of their <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#007">fold</a>: they shall make great noise by reason of the multitude of men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a>, and are gone out by it: and their <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> shall pass before them, and the LORD on the head of them.<br>
