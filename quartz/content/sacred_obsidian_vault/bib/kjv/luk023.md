 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Luke Chapter 23</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#006">tribute</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#002">Caesar</a>, saying that he himself is <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> a <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</a> of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a> to this place.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> When Pilate heard of <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a>, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> at that time.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And when Herod saw <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some <a href="../ebd/ebd256.htm#002">miracle</a> done by him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And the chief priests and <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</a> stood and vehemently accused him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at <a href="../ebd/ebd121.htm#003">enmity</a> between themselves.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> I will therefore chastise him, and release him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> (For of necessity he must release one unto them at the <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a>.)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us <a href="../ebd/ebd044.htm#002">Barabbas</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> (Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for <a href="../ebd/ebd262.htm#002">murder</a>, was cast into <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a>.)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Pilate therefore, willing to release <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, spake again to them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And he released unto them him that for sedition and <a href="../ebd/ebd262.htm#002">murder</a> was cast into <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a>, whom they had desired; but he delivered <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> to their will.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a>, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#000">cross</a>, that he might bear it after <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> turning unto them said, Daughters of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#007">barren</a>, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And when they were come to the place, which is called <a href="../ebd/ebd069.htm#009">Calvary</a>, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> him <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#006">vinegar</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> And saying, If thou be the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of the Jews, save thyself.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> And a superscription also was written over him in letters of <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#004">Greek</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd224.htm#007">Latin</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#009">Hebrew</a>, THIS IS THE <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">KING</a> OF THE JEWS.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, save thyself and us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> And he said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in <a href="../ebd/ebd284.htm#004">paradise</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a> over all the earth until the ninth hour.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> was darkened, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#001">veil</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> was <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</a> in the midst.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="046">46</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>: and having said thus, he gave up the <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">ghost</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="047">47</a> Now when the <a href="../ebd/ebd075.htm#004">centurion</a> saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="048">48</a> And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="049">49</a> And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a>, stood afar off, beholding these things.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="050">50</a> And, behold, there was a man named <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>, a <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#005">counsellor</a>; and he was a good man, and a just:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="051">51</a> (The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="052">52</a> This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="053">53</a> And he took it down, and wrapped it in <a href="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</a>, and laid it in a <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</a> that was hewn in <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a>, wherein never man before was laid.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="054">54</a> And that day was the preparation, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> drew on.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="055">55</a> And the women also, which came with him from <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a>, followed after, and beheld the <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</a>, and how his body was laid.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="056">56</a> And they returned, and prepared <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#005">spices</a> and ointments; and rested the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> day according to the commandment.<br>
