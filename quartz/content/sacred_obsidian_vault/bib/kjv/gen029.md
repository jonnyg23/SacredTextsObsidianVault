 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Genesis Chapter 29</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> went on his <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</a>, and came into the land of the people of the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there were three flocks of <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a> lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and a great <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> was upon the well's mouth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> from the well's mouth, and watered the <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>, and put the <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> again upon the well's mouth in his place.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they said, Of <a href="../ebd/ebd163.htm#007">Haran</a> are we.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And he said unto them, Know ye <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd265.htm#006">Nahor</a>? And they said, We know him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well: and, behold, <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#004">Rachel</a> his daughter cometh with the <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a> should be gathered together: water ye the <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>, and go and feed them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and till they <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#004">roll</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> from the well's mouth; then we water the <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And while he yet spake with them, <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#004">Rachel</a> came with her father's <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>; for she kept them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And it came to pass, when <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> saw <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#004">Rachel</a> the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</a> his mother's brother, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</a> his mother's brother, that <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> went near, and rolled the <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</a> his mother's brother.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> kissed <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#004">Rachel</a>, and lifted up his voice, and wept.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> told <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#004">Rachel</a> that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And it came to pass, when <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</a> heard the tidings of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</a> all these things.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</a> said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>. And he abode with him the space of a month.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#004">wages</a> be?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</a> had two daughters: the name of the <a href="../ebd/ebd114.htm#008">elder</a> was <a href="../ebd/ebd225.htm#006">Leah</a>, and the name of the younger was <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#004">Rachel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd225.htm#006">Leah</a> was tender eyed; but <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#004">Rachel</a> was beautiful and well favoured.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> loved <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#004">Rachel</a>; and said, I will serve thee <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> years for <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#004">Rachel</a> thy younger daughter.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</a> said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> served <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> years for <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#004">Rachel</a>; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</a>, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</a> gathered together all the men of the place, and made a <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And it came to pass in the evening, that he took <a href="../ebd/ebd225.htm#006">Leah</a> his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</a> gave unto his daughter <a href="../ebd/ebd225.htm#006">Leah</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd393.htm#005">Zilpah</a> his maid for an <a href="../ebd/ebd162.htm#008">handmaid</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was <a href="../ebd/ebd225.htm#006">Leah</a>: and he said to <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</a>, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#004">Rachel</a>? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</a> said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> other years.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#004">Rachel</a> his daughter to wife also.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</a> gave to <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#004">Rachel</a> his daughter <a href="../ebd/ebd058.htm#008">Bilhah</a> his <a href="../ebd/ebd162.htm#008">handmaid</a> to be her maid.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And he went in also unto <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#004">Rachel</a>, and he loved also <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#004">Rachel</a> more than <a href="../ebd/ebd225.htm#006">Leah</a>, and served with him yet <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> other years.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And when the LORD saw that <a href="../ebd/ebd225.htm#006">Leah</a> was hated, he opened her womb: but <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#004">Rachel</a> was <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#007">barren</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd225.htm#006">Leah</a> conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name <a href="../ebd/ebd311.htm#009">Reuben</a>: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the LORD hath heard I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also: and she called his name <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#002">Simeon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons: therefore was his name called <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#006">Levi</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>; and left bearing.<br>
