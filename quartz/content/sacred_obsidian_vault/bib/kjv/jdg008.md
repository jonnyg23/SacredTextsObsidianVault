 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Judges Chapter 8</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a> said unto him, Why hast thou served us thus, that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight with the Midianites?  And they did chide with him sharply.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a> better than the vintage of <a href="../ebd/ebd003.htm#000">Abiezer</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> God hath delivered into your hands the princes of <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#007">Midian</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd280.htm#001">Oreb</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#009">Zeeb</a>: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then their <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> was abated toward him, when he had said that.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</a> came to <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a>, and passed over, he, and the three hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And he said unto the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd352.htm#008">Succoth</a>, Give, I pray you, loaves of <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> unto the people that follow me; for they be faint, and I am pursuing after <a href="../ebd/ebd388.htm#006">Zebah</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd387.htm#002">Zalmunna</a>, kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#007">Midian</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And the princes of <a href="../ebd/ebd352.htm#008">Succoth</a> said, Are the hands of <a href="../ebd/ebd388.htm#006">Zebah</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd387.htm#002">Zalmunna</a> now in thine hand, that we should give <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> unto thine army?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</a> said, Therefore when the LORD hath delivered <a href="../ebd/ebd388.htm#006">Zebah</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd387.htm#002">Zalmunna</a> into mine hand, then I will tear your <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> with the thorns of the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> and with briers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And he went up thence to <a href="../ebd/ebd289.htm#005">Penuel</a>, and spake unto them likewise: and the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd289.htm#005">Penuel</a> answered him as the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd352.htm#008">Succoth</a> had answered him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And he spake also unto the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd289.htm#005">Penuel</a>, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Now <a href="../ebd/ebd388.htm#006">Zebah</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd387.htm#002">Zalmunna</a> were in <a href="../ebd/ebd215.htm#009">Karkor</a>, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a>: for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</a> went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd274.htm#004">Nobah</a> and Jogbehah, and smote the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a>; for the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> was secure.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd388.htm#006">Zebah</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd387.htm#002">Zalmunna</a> fled, he pursued after them, and took the two kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#007">Midian</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd388.htm#006">Zebah</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd387.htm#002">Zalmunna</a>, and discomfited all the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd208.htm#000">Joash</a> returned from battle before the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> was up,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And caught a young man of the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd352.htm#008">Succoth</a>, and enquired of him: and he described unto him the princes of <a href="../ebd/ebd352.htm#008">Succoth</a>, and the elders thereof, even threescore and seventeen men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And he came unto the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd352.htm#008">Succoth</a>, and said, Behold <a href="../ebd/ebd388.htm#006">Zebah</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd387.htm#002">Zalmunna</a>, with whom ye did upbraid me, saying, Are the hands of <a href="../ebd/ebd388.htm#006">Zebah</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd387.htm#002">Zalmunna</a> now in thine hand, that we should give <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> unto thy men that are weary?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> and briers, and with them he taught the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd352.htm#008">Succoth</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And he beat down the tower of <a href="../ebd/ebd289.htm#005">Penuel</a>, and slew the men of the city.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Then said he unto <a href="../ebd/ebd388.htm#006">Zebah</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd387.htm#002">Zalmunna</a>, What manner of men were they whom ye slew at <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#007">Tabor</a>? And they answered, As thou art, so were they; each one resembled the children of a <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And he said, They were my brethren, even the sons of my mother: as the LORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And he said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#007">Jether</a> his firstborn, Up, and slay them. But the youth drew not his <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>: for he feared, because he was yet a youth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd388.htm#006">Zebah</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd387.htm#002">Zalmunna</a> said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for as the man is, so is his strength. And <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</a> arose, and slew <a href="../ebd/ebd388.htm#006">Zebah</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd387.htm#002">Zalmunna</a>, and took away the ornaments that were on their camels' necks.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Then the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</a>, Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son's son also: for thou hast delivered us from the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#007">Midian</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</a> said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the LORD shall rule over you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</a> said unto them, I would desire a request of you, that ye would give me every man the <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#007">earrings</a> of his prey. (For they had golden <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#007">earrings</a>, because they were Ishmaelites.)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And they answered, We will willingly give them. And they spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#007">earrings</a> of his prey.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And the weight of the golden <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#007">earrings</a> that he requested was a thousand and <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> hundred shekels of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>; beside ornaments, and collars, and purple raiment that was on the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#007">Midian</a>, and beside the chains that were about their camels' necks.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</a> made an <a href="../ebd/ebd122.htm#008">ephod</a> thereof, and put it in his city, even in <a href="../ebd/ebd279.htm#009">Ophrah</a>: and all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> went thither a whoring after it: which thing became a <a href="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</a>, and to his house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Thus was <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#007">Midian</a> subdued before the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, so that they lifted up their heads no more. And the country was in quietness forty years in the days of <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#002">Jerubbaal</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd208.htm#000">Joash</a> went and dwelt in his own house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</a> had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten: for he had many wives.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And his <a href="../ebd/ebd087.htm#007">concubine</a> that was in <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#003">Shechem</a>, she also bare him a son, whose name he called <a href="../ebd/ebd004.htm#000">Abimelech</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd208.htm#000">Joash</a> died in a good old age, and was buried in the <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd208.htm#000">Joash</a> his father, in <a href="../ebd/ebd279.htm#009">Ophrah</a> of the Abiezrites.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And it came to pass, as soon as <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</a> was dead, that the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> turned again, and went a whoring after <a href="../ebd/ebd039.htm#007">Baalim</a>, and made Baalberith their god.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> And the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> remembered not the LORD their God, who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> Neither shewed they kindness to the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#002">Jerubbaal</a>, namely, <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</a>, according to all the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</a> which he had shewed unto <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
