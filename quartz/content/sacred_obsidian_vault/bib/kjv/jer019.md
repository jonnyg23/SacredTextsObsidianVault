 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 19</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Thus saith the LORD, Go and get a potter's earthen <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#002">bottle</a>, and take of the ancients of the people, and of the ancients of the priests;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And go forth unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a> of the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#002">Hinnom</a>, which is by the entry of the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a>, and proclaim there the words that I shall tell thee,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And say, Hear ye the word of the LORD, O kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>; Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, the which whosoever heareth, his ears shall tingle.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place, and have burned <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a> in it unto other gods, whom neither they nor their fathers have known, nor the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and have filled this place with the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of innocents;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> They have built also the high places of <a href="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</a>, to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings unto <a href="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</a>, which I commanded not, nor spake it, neither came it into my mind:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that this place shall no more be called <a href="../ebd/ebd370.htm#007">Tophet</a>, nor The <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a> of the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#002">Hinnom</a>, but The <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a> of slaughter.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And I will make void the counsel of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> in this place; and I will cause them to fall by the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> before their enemies, and by the hands of them that seek their lives: and their carcases will I give to be meat for the fowls of the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and for the beasts of the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And I will make this city desolate, and an hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#005">hiss</a> because of all the plagues thereof.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And I will cause them to eat the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> of their sons and the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> of their daughters, and they shall eat every one the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> of his friend in the siege and straitness, wherewith their enemies, and they that seek their lives, shall straiten them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Then shalt thou break the <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#002">bottle</a> in the sight of the men that go with thee,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Even so will I break this people and this city, as one breaketh a potter's vessel, that cannot be made whole again: and they shall bury them in <a href="../ebd/ebd370.htm#007">Tophet</a>, till there be no place to bury.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Thus will I do unto this place, saith the LORD, and to the inhabitants thereof, and even make this city as <a href="../ebd/ebd370.htm#007">Tophet</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And the houses of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and the houses of the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, shall be defiled as the place of <a href="../ebd/ebd370.htm#007">Tophet</a>, because of all the houses upon whose roofs they have burned <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a> unto all the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and have poured out <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> offerings unto other gods.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Then came <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> from <a href="../ebd/ebd370.htm#007">Tophet</a>, whither the LORD had sent him to prophesy; and he stood in the court of the LORD's house; and said to all the people,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; Behold, I will bring upon this city and upon all her towns all the evil that I have pronounced against it, because they have hardened their necks, that they might not hear my words.<br>
