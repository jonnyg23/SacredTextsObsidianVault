 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Genesis Chapter 40</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And it came to pass after these things, that the <a href="../ebd/ebd067.htm#001">butler</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> and his baker had offended their lord the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> was wroth against two of his officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And he put them in <a href="../ebd/ebd379.htm#001">ward</a> in the house of the captain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</a>, into the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a>, the place where <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> was bound.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And the captain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</a> charged <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> with them, and he served them: and they continued a season in <a href="../ebd/ebd379.htm#001">ward</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And they dreamed a <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a> both of them, each man his <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a> in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd067.htm#001">butler</a> and the baker of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, which were bound in the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them, and, behold, they were sad.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the <a href="../ebd/ebd379.htm#001">ward</a> of his lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And they said unto him, We have dreamed a <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a>, and there is no interpreter of it. And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And the chief <a href="../ebd/ebd067.htm#001">butler</a> told his <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>, and said to him, In my <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a>, behold, a <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</a> was before me;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And in the <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</a> were three branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And Pharaoh's <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</a> was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</a>, and I gave the <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</a> into Pharaoh's hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Yet within three days shall <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</a> into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his <a href="../ebd/ebd067.htm#001">butler</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, and bring me out of this house:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#001">Hebrews</a>: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#006">dungeon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>, I also was in my <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a>, and, behold, I had three white baskets on my head:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And in the uppermost <a href="../ebd/ebd046.htm#009">basket</a> there was of all manner of bakemeats for <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>; and the birds did eat them out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd046.htm#009">basket</a> upon my head.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three days:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Yet within three days shall <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> from off thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a> unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief <a href="../ebd/ebd067.htm#001">butler</a> and of the chief baker among his servants.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And he restored the chief <a href="../ebd/ebd067.htm#001">butler</a> unto his butlership again; and he gave the <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</a> into Pharaoh's hand:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> But he hanged the chief baker: as <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> had interpreted to them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Yet did not the chief <a href="../ebd/ebd067.htm#001">butler</a> remember <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>, but forgat him.<br>
