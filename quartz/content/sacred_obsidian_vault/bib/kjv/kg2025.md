 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 25</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#005">Nebuchadnezzar</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> came, he, and all his <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a>, against <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and pitched against it; and they built forts against it round about.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And on the ninth day of the fourth month the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a> prevailed in the city, and there was no <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> for the people of the land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> between two walls, which is by the king's garden: (now the <a href="../ebd/ebd076.htm#002">Chaldees</a> were against the city round about:) and the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> went the way toward the <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And the army of the <a href="../ebd/ebd076.htm#002">Chaldees</a> pursued after the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, and overtook him in the plains of <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#008">Jericho</a>: and all his army were scattered from him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> So they took the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, and brought him up to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#002">Riblah</a>; and they gave judgment upon him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And they slew the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</a> before his eyes, and put out the eyes of <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</a>, and bound him with fetters of <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a>, and carried him to <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which is the nineteenth year of <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#005">Nebuchadnezzar</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, came <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#008">Nebuzaradan</a>, captain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</a>, a servant of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, unto <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And he burnt the house of the LORD, and the king's house, and all the houses of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and every great man's house burnt he with fire.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And all the army of the <a href="../ebd/ebd076.htm#002">Chaldees</a>, that were with the captain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</a>, brake down the walls of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> round about.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Now the rest of the people that were left in the city, and the fugitives that fell away to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, with the remnant of the multitude, did <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#008">Nebuzaradan</a> the captain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</a> carry away.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> But the captain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</a> left of the door of the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And the pillars of <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a> that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brasen sea that was in the house of the LORD, did the <a href="../ebd/ebd076.htm#002">Chaldees</a> break in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a>, and carried the <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a> of them to <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons, and all the vessels of <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a> wherewith they ministered, took they away.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And the firepans, and the bowls, and such things as were of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, in <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, and of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, in <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, the captain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</a> took away.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> The two pillars, one sea, and the bases which <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> had made for the house of the LORD; the <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a> of all these vessels was without weight.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> The height of the one <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#007">pillar</a> was eighteen cubits, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#004">chapiter</a> upon it was <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a>: and the height of the <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#004">chapiter</a> three cubits; and the wreathen work, and pomegranates upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#004">chapiter</a> round about, all of <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a>: and like unto these had the second <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#007">pillar</a> with wreathen work.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And the captain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</a> took <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#003">Seraiah</a> the chief <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd390.htm#008">Zephaniah</a> the second <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, and the three keepers of the door:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war, and five men of them that were in the king's presence, which were found in the city, and the principal scribe of the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a>, which mustered the people of the land, and threescore men of the people of the land that were found in the city:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#008">Nebuzaradan</a> captain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</a> took these, and brought them to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#002">Riblah</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> smote them, and slew them at <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#002">Riblah</a> in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd160.htm#005">Hamath</a>. So <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> was carried away out of their land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And as for the people that remained in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, whom <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#005">Nebuchadnezzar</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> had left, even over them he made <a href="../ebd/ebd144.htm#009">Gedaliah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd014.htm#001">Ahikam</a>, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd331.htm#004">Shaphan</a>, ruler.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And when all the captains of the armies, they and their men, heard that the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> had made <a href="../ebd/ebd144.htm#009">Gedaliah</a> governor, there came to <a href="../ebd/ebd144.htm#009">Gedaliah</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#000">Mizpah</a>, even <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#005">Ishmael</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd271.htm#004">Nethaniah</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd208.htm#009">Johanan</a> the son of Careah, and <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#003">Seraiah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd358.htm#006">Tanhumeth</a> the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd144.htm#009">Gedaliah</a> sware to them, and to their men, and said unto them, Fear not to be the servants of the <a href="../ebd/ebd076.htm#002">Chaldees</a>: dwell in the land, and serve the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>; and it shall be well with you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> But it came to pass in the seventh month, that <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#005">Ishmael</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd271.htm#004">Nethaniah</a>, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd118.htm#001">Elishama</a>, of the seed royal, came, and ten men with him, and smote <a href="../ebd/ebd144.htm#009">Gedaliah</a>, that he died, and the Jews and the <a href="../ebd/ebd076.htm#002">Chaldees</a> that were with him at <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#000">Mizpah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the armies, arose, and came to <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>: for they were afraid of the <a href="../ebd/ebd076.htm#002">Chaldees</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And it came to pass in the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> and thirtieth year of the <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#000">Jehoiachin</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, in the twelfth month, on the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> in the year that he began to reign did lift up the head of <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#000">Jehoiachin</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> out of <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And he spake kindly to him, and set his <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> above the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> of the kings that were with him in <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And changed his <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a> garments: and he did eat <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> continually before him all the days of his life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And his allowance was a continual allowance given him of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, a daily rate for every day, all the days of his life.<br>
