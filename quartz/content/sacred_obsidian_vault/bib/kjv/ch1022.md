 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Chronicles Chapter 22</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> said, This is the house of the LORD God, and this is the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> of the burnt <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> for <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> commanded to gather together the strangers that were in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> prepared <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a> in abundance for the nails for the <a href="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</a> of the gates, and for the joinings; and <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a> in abundance without weight;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Also <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</a> trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of <a href="../ebd/ebd374.htm#001">Tyre</a> brought much <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> said, <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be builded for the LORD must be exceeding magnifical, of fame and of <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> throughout all countries: I will therefore now make preparation for it. So <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> prepared abundantly before his death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Then he called for <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> his son, and charged him to build an house for the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> said to <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a>, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Thou hast shed <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build an house unto my name, because thou hast shed much <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> upon the earth in my sight.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a>, and I will give peace and quietness unto <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> in his days.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> He shall build an house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> of his kingdom over <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Now, my son, the LORD be with thee; and prosper thou, and build the house of the LORD thy God, as he hath said of thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Only the LORD give thee wisdom and understanding, and give thee charge concerning <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, that thou mayest keep the law of the LORD thy God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the statutes and judgments which the LORD charged <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> with concerning <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: be strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the LORD an hundred thousand talents of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, and a thousand thousand talents of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>; and of <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a> without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> have I prepared; and thou mayest add thereto.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and workers of <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> and timber, and all manner of cunning men for every manner of work.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Of the <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a>, there is no number. Arise therefore, and be doing, and the LORD be with thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> also commanded all the princes of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> to help <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> his son, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Is not the LORD your God with you? and hath he not given you rest on every side? for he hath given the inhabitants of the land into mine hand; and the land is subdued before the LORD, and before his people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God; arise therefore, and build ye the <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</a> of the LORD God, to bring the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> of the LORD, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of the LORD.<br>
