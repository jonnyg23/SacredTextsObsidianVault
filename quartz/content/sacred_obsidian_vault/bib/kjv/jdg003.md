 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Judges Chapter 3</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to prove <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> by them, even as many of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> as had not known all the wars of <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Only that the generations of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Namely, five lords of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>, and all the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#007">Canaanites</a>, and the Sidonians, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#007">Hivites</a> that dwelt in <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</a>, from <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> Baalhermon unto the entering in of <a href="../ebd/ebd160.htm#005">Hamath</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And they were to prove <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> dwelt among the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#007">Canaanites</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#006">Hittites</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#006">Amorites</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd290.htm#006">Perizzites</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#007">Hivites</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd199.htm#004">Jebusites</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgat the LORD their God, and served <a href="../ebd/ebd039.htm#007">Baalim</a> and the groves.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Therefore the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> of the LORD was hot against <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and he sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd251.htm#003">Mesopotamia</a>: and the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> served Chushanrishathaim eight years.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And when the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, who delivered them, even <a href="../ebd/ebd281.htm#003">Othniel</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd217.htm#003">Kenaz</a>, Caleb's younger brother.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> of the LORD came upon him, and he judged <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd251.htm#003">Mesopotamia</a> into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And the land had rest forty years. And <a href="../ebd/ebd281.htm#003">Othniel</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd217.htm#003">Kenaz</a> died.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#008">Eglon</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a> against <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And he gathered unto him the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#009">Amalek</a>, and went and smote <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and possessed the city of palm trees.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> So the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> served <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#008">Eglon</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a> eighteen years.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> But when the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, <a href="../ebd/ebd114.htm#000">Ehud</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#003">Gera</a>, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and by him the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> sent a present unto <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#008">Eglon</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd114.htm#000">Ehud</a> made him a dagger which had two edges, of a <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#006">cubit</a> length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And he brought the present unto <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#008">Eglon</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#008">Eglon</a> was a very <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</a> man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> But he himself turned again from the <a href="../ebd/ebd303.htm#004">quarries</a> that were by <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#001">Gilgal</a>, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd114.htm#000">Ehud</a> came unto him; and he was <a href="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</a> in a summer <a href="../ebd/ebd285.htm#002">parlour</a>, which he had for himself alone. And <a href="../ebd/ebd114.htm#000">Ehud</a> said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd114.htm#000">Ehud</a> put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd158.htm#004">haft</a> also went in after the <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#003">blade</a>; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</a> closed upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#003">blade</a>, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</a>; and the dirt came out.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd114.htm#000">Ehud</a> went forth through the porch, and shut the <a href="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd285.htm#002">parlour</a> upon him, and locked them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the <a href="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd285.htm#002">parlour</a> were locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer <a href="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the <a href="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd285.htm#002">parlour</a>; therefore they took a <a href="../ebd/ebd218.htm#002">key</a>, and opened them: and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd114.htm#000">Ehud</a> escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the <a href="../ebd/ebd303.htm#004">quarries</a>, and escaped unto <a href="../ebd/ebd326.htm#005">Seirath</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a>, and the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> went down with him from the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a>, and he before them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a> toward <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>, and suffered not a man to pass over.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And they slew of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a> at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a> was subdued that day under the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>. And the land had rest fourscore years.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And after him was <a href="../ebd/ebd331.htm#000">Shamgar</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd023.htm#002">Anath</a>, which slew of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> six hundred men with an <a href="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd151.htm#000">goad</a>: and he also delivered <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
