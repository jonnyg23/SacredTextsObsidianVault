 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 15</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And it came to pass after this, that <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> rose up early, and stood beside the way of the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a>: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> for judgment, then <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> called unto him, and said, Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> to hear thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> said moreover, Oh that I were made <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him <a href="../ebd/ebd214.htm#007">justice</a>!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do him <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#006">obeisance</a>, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And on this manner did <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> to all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> that came to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> for judgment: so <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> stole the hearts of the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And it came to pass after forty years, that <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> said unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD, in <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#004">Hebron</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#001">Geshur</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</a>, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, then I will serve the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#004">Hebron</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> sent <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#007">spies</a> throughout all the tribes of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> reigneth in <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#004">Hebron</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And with <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> went two hundred men out of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, that were called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> sent for <a href="../ebd/ebd015.htm#000">Ahithophel</a> the Gilonite, David's <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#005">counsellor</a>, from his city, even from <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#002">Giloh</a>, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And there came a <a href="../ebd/ebd251.htm#005">messenger</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, saying, The hearts of the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> are after <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> said unto all his servants that were with him at <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a>: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And the king's servants said unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> shall appoint.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> went forth, and all his household after him. And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the <a href="../ebd/ebd289.htm#000">Pelethites</a>, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#009">Gath</a>, passed on before the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Then said the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#007">Ittai</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#009">Gittite</a>, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>: for thou art a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a>, and also an <a href="../ebd/ebd128.htm#004">exile</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back thy brethren: <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> and truth be with thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#007">Ittai</a> answered the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, and said, As the LORD liveth, and as my lord the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> liveth, surely in what place my lord the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> said to <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#007">Ittai</a>, Go and pass over. And <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#007">Ittai</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#009">Gittite</a> passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> also himself passed over the <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#006">brook</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd218.htm#008">Kidron</a>, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And lo <a href="../ebd/ebd386.htm#008">Zadok</a> also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> of God: and they set down the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of God; and <a href="../ebd/ebd002.htm#005">Abiathar</a> went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd386.htm#008">Zadok</a>, Carry back the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of God into the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me again, and shew me both it, and his <a href="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said also unto <a href="../ebd/ebd386.htm#008">Zadok</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, Art not thou a <a href="../ebd/ebd326.htm#000">seer</a>? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, <a href="../ebd/ebd014.htm#002">Ahimaaz</a> thy son, and <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd002.htm#005">Abiathar</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> See, I will tarry in the <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, until there come word from you to certify me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd386.htm#008">Zadok</a> therefore and <a href="../ebd/ebd002.htm#005">Abiathar</a> carried the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of God again to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>: and they tarried there.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> went up by the ascent of <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went <a href="../ebd/ebd044.htm#008">barefoot</a>: and all the people that was with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And one told <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, saying, <a href="../ebd/ebd015.htm#000">Ahithophel</a> is among the conspirators with <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a>. And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> said, O LORD, I pray thee, turn the counsel of <a href="../ebd/ebd015.htm#000">Ahithophel</a> into foolishness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And it came to pass, that when <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> was come to the top of the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a>, where he worshipped God, behold, <a href="../ebd/ebd185.htm#003">Hushai</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd029.htm#006">Archite</a> came to meet him with his <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#004">coat</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</a>, and earth upon his head:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Unto whom <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</a> unto me:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> But if thou return to the city, and say unto <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a>, I will be thy servant, O <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>; as I have been thy father's servant hitherto, so will I now also be thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of <a href="../ebd/ebd015.htm#000">Ahithophel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And hast thou not there with thee <a href="../ebd/ebd386.htm#008">Zadok</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd002.htm#005">Abiathar</a> the priests?  therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell it to <a href="../ebd/ebd386.htm#008">Zadok</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd002.htm#005">Abiathar</a> the priests.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> Behold, they have there with them their two sons, <a href="../ebd/ebd014.htm#002">Ahimaaz</a> Zadok's son, and <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> Abiathar's son; and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd185.htm#003">Hushai</a> David's friend came into the city, and <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> came into <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
