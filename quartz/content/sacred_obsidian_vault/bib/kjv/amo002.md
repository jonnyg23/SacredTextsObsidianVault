 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Amos Chapter 2</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>, and for four, I will not turn away the <a href="../ebd/ebd302.htm#005">punishment</a> thereof; because he burned the bones of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</a> into <a href="../ebd/ebd229.htm#006">lime</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> But I will send a fire upon <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>, and it shall devour the palaces of Kirioth: and <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a> shall die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And I will cut off the <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> from the midst thereof, and will slay all the princes thereof with him, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and for four, I will not turn away the <a href="../ebd/ebd302.htm#005">punishment</a> thereof; because they have despised the law of the LORD, and have not kept his commandments, and their lies caused them to err, after the which their fathers have walked:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> But I will send a fire upon <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and it shall devour the palaces of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and for four, I will not turn away the <a href="../ebd/ebd302.htm#005">punishment</a> thereof; because they sold the righteous for <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> for a pair of shoes;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> That pant after the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a> of the earth on the head of the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go in unto the same maid, to profane my holy name:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And they lay themselves down upon clothes laid to <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#005">pledge</a> by every <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a>, and they <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> of the condemned in the house of their god.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> from above, and his roots from beneath.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Also I brought you up from the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and led you forty years through the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, to possess the land of the Amorite.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazarites. Is it not even thus, O ye children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>? saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> But ye gave the Nazarites <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>; and commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Behold, I am pressed under you, as a <a href="../ebd/ebd073.htm#001">cart</a> is pressed that is full of sheaves.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Therefore the flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not strengthen his force, neither shall the mighty deliver himself:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Neither shall he stand that handleth the <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a>; and he that is swift of foot shall not deliver himself: neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</a> in that day, saith the LORD.<br>
