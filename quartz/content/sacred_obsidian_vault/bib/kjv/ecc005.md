 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Ecclesiastes Chapter 5</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> of fools: for they consider not that they do evil.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before God: for God is in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> For a <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a> cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool's voice is known by multitude of words.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>; neither say thou before the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a>, that it was an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> For in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also divers vanities: but fear thou God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> If thou seest the oppression of the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>, and violent perverting of judgment and <a href="../ebd/ebd214.htm#007">justice</a> in a province, marvel not at the matter: for he that is higher than the highest regardeth; and there be higher than they.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> himself is served by the field.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> He that loveth <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> shall not be satisfied with <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>; nor he that loveth abundance with increase: this is also vanity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good is there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding of them with their eyes?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> The sleep of a labouring man is sweet, whether he eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> There is a sore evil which I have seen under the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a>, namely, riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a son, and there is nothing in his hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> As he came forth of his mother's womb, <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</a> shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And this also is a sore evil, that in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> All his days also he eateth in <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>, and he hath much sorrow and wrath with his sickness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Behold that which I have seen: it is good and comely for one to eat and to <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>, and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> all the days of his life, which God giveth him: for it is his portion.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labour; this is the <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</a> of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God answereth him in the joy of his heart.<br>
