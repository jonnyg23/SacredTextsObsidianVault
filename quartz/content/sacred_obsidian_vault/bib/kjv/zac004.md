 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Zechariah Chapter 4</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a <a href="../ebd/ebd071.htm#001">candlestick</a> all of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, with a <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#006">bowl</a> upon the top of it, and his <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> lamps thereon, and <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> pipes to the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> lamps, which are upon the top thereof:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And two <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#009">olive</a> trees by it, one upon the right side of the <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#006">bowl</a>, and the other upon the left side thereof.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> So I answered and spake to the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> that talked with me, saying, What are these, my lord?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Then the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of the LORD unto <a href="../ebd/ebd391.htm#008">Zerubbabel</a>, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>, saith the LORD of hosts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Who art thou, O great mountain? before <a href="../ebd/ebd391.htm#008">Zerubbabel</a> thou shalt become a <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</a>: and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings, crying, <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">Grace</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> unto it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> The hands of <a href="../ebd/ebd391.htm#008">Zerubbabel</a> have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd391.htm#008">Zerubbabel</a> with those <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a>; they are the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro through the whole earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Then answered I, and said unto him, What are these two <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#009">olive</a> trees upon the right side of the <a href="../ebd/ebd071.htm#001">candlestick</a> and upon the left side thereof?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And I answered again, and said unto him, What be these two <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#009">olive</a> branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Then said he, These are the two anointed ones, that stand by the LORD of the whole earth.<br>
