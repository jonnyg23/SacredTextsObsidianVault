 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 7</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Also, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD unto the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; An end, the end is come upon the four corners of the land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Now is the end come upon thee, and I will send mine <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> upon thee, and will <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> thee according to thy ways, and will recompense upon thee all thine abominations.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity: but I will recompense thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Thus saith the Lord GOD; An evil, an only evil, behold, is come.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> An end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for thee; behold, it is come.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> The morning is come unto thee, O thou that dwellest in the land: the time is come, the day of trouble is near, and not the sounding again of the mountains.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Now will I shortly pour out my <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</a> upon thee, and accomplish mine <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> upon thee: and I will <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> thee according to thy ways, and will recompense thee for all thine abominations.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will recompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations that are in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I am the LORD that smiteth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth; the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness: none of them shall remain, nor of their multitude, nor of any of their's: neither shall there be wailing for them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller <a href="../ebd/ebd261.htm#004">mourn</a>: for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they were yet alive: for the <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a> is touching the whole multitude thereof, which shall not return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none goeth to the battle: for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> is without, and the pestilence and the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a> within: he that is in the field shall die with the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>; and he that is in the city, <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a> and pestilence shall devour him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every one for his iniquity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> They shall also gird themselves with <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#001">sackcloth</a>, and horror shall cover them; and shame shall be upon all faces, and <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#008">baldness</a> upon all their heads.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> They shall cast their <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> in the streets, and their <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> shall be removed: their <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> and their <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#004">bowels</a>: because it is the stumblingblock of their iniquity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but they made the images of their abominations and of their detestable things therein: therefore have I set it far from them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall pollute it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my secret place: for the robbers shall enter into it, and defile it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Make a <a href="../ebd/ebd075.htm#008">chain</a>: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Wherefore I will bring the worst of the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a>, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be defiled.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">Destruction</a> cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon rumour; then shall they seek a <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>; but the law shall perish from the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, and counsel from the ancients.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> shall <a href="../ebd/ebd261.htm#004">mourn</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</a> shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.<br>
