 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Philippians Chapter 3</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is safe.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the <a href="../ebd/ebd087.htm#006">concision</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> For we are the <a href="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</a>, which <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> God in the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>, and rejoice in <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, and have no confidence in the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Though I might also have confidence in the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>. If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, I more:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, of the <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a>, an <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#009">Hebrew</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#001">Hebrews</a>; as touching the law, a Pharisee;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Concerning <a href="../ebd/ebd388.htm#003">zeal</a>, persecuting the church; touching the <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> which is in the law, blameless.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#003">dung</a>, that I may win <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And be found in him, not having mine own <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> which is of God by faith:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#002">fellowship</a> of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> I press toward the mark for the prize of the high <a href="../ebd/ebd069.htm#007">calling</a> of God in <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#000">cross</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Whose end is <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a>, whose God is their <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</a>, and whose <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> is in their shame, who mind earthly things.)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> For our <a href="../ebd/ebd089.htm#001">conversation</a> is in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>; from whence also we look for the <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#003">Saviour</a>, the Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.<br>
