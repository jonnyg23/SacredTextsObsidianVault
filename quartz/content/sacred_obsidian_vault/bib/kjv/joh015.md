 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: John Chapter 15</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> I am the true <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</a>, and my Father is the <a href="../ebd/ebd185.htm#002">husbandman</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Every <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#002">branch</a> in me that beareth not <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> he taketh away: and every <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#002">branch</a> that beareth <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a>, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Now ye are <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</a> through the word which I have spoken unto you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Abide in me, and I in you. As the <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#002">branch</a> cannot bear <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> of itself, except it abide in the <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</a>; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> I am the <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</a>, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a>: for without me ye can do nothing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#002">branch</a>, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a>; so shall ye be my disciples.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Ye have not <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> me, but I have <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a>, and that your <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> These things I command you, that ye love one another.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>: but now they have no <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#009">cloak</a> for their <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> He that hateth me hateth my Father also.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> But when the <a href="../ebd/ebd087.htm#001">Comforter</a> is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And ye also shall bear <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a>, because ye have been with me from the beginning.<br>
