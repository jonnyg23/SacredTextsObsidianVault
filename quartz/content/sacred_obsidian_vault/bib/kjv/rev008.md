 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Revelation Chapter 8</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And when he had opened the seventh <a href="../ebd/ebd325.htm#002">seal</a>, there was silence in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> about the space of half an hour.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And I saw the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> angels which stood before God; and to them were given <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd373.htm#001">trumpets</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And another <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> came and stood at the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a>, having a golden <a href="../ebd/ebd075.htm#002">censer</a>; and there was given unto him much <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a>, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> which was before the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And the smoke of the <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a>, which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> took the <a href="../ebd/ebd075.htm#002">censer</a>, and filled it with fire of the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a>, and cast it into the earth: and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#009">earthquake</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> angels which had the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd373.htm#001">trumpets</a> prepared themselves to sound.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> The first <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> sounded, and there followed <a href="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</a> and fire mingled with <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</a> was burnt up.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And the second <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the <a href="../ebd/ebd339.htm#003">ships</a> were destroyed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And the third <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> sounded, and there fell a great star from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, burning as it were a <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#007">lamp</a>, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And the name of the star is called <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#001">Wormwood</a>: and the third part of the waters became <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#001">wormwood</a>; and many men died of the waters, because they were made <a href="../ebd/ebd059.htm#009">bitter</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And the fourth <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> sounded, and the third part of the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> was smitten, and the third part of the <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#004">moon</a>, and the third part of the <a href="../ebd/ebd350.htm#008">stars</a>; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And I beheld, and heard an <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> flying through the midst of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound!<br>
