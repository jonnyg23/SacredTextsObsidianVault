 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 23</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And in the seventh year <a href="../ebd/ebd200.htm#009">Jehoiada</a> strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds, <a href="../ebd/ebd037.htm#005">Azariah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#001">Jeroham</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#005">Ishmael</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd200.htm#008">Jehohanan</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd037.htm#005">Azariah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#004">Obed</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd234.htm#007">Maaseiah</a> the son of Adaiah, and <a href="../ebd/ebd118.htm#002">Elishaphat</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd392.htm#007">Zichri</a>, into <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And they went about in <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and the chief of the fathers of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and they came to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And all the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a> made a <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> with the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> in the house of God. And he said unto them, Behold, the king's son shall reign, as the LORD hath said of the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> This is the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you entering on the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a>, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be porters of the <a href="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And a third part shall be at the king's house; and a third part at the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> of the foundation: and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> But let none come into the house of the LORD, save the priests, and they that <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</a> of the Levites; they shall go in, for they are holy: but all the people shall keep the watch of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And the Levites shall compass the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whosoever else cometh into the house, he shall be put to death: but be ye with the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> when he cometh in, and when he goeth out.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> So the Levites and all <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> did according to all things that <a href="../ebd/ebd200.htm#009">Jehoiada</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> had commanded, and took every man his men that were to come in on the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a>, with them that were to go out on the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a>: for <a href="../ebd/ebd200.htm#009">Jehoiada</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> dismissed not the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#006">courses</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Moreover <a href="../ebd/ebd200.htm#009">Jehoiada</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> delivered to the captains of hundreds spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> David's, which were in the house of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> to the left side of the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>, along by the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> and the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>, by the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> round about.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Then they brought out the king's son, and put upon him the <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</a>, and gave him the <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</a>, and made him <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>. And <a href="../ebd/ebd200.htm#009">Jehoiada</a> and his sons anointed him, and said, God save the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Now when <a href="../ebd/ebd036.htm#002">Athaliah</a> heard the noise of the people running and praising the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, she came to the people into the house of the LORD:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And she looked, and, behold, the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> stood at his <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#007">pillar</a> at the entering in, and the princes and the <a href="../ebd/ebd373.htm#001">trumpets</a> by the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>: and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with <a href="../ebd/ebd373.htm#001">trumpets</a>, also the singers with instruments of musick, and such as taught to sing praise. Then <a href="../ebd/ebd036.htm#002">Athaliah</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</a> her clothes, and said, Treason, Treason.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd200.htm#009">Jehoiada</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a>, and said unto them, Have her forth of the <a href="../ebd/ebd307.htm#004">ranges</a>: and whoso followeth her, let him be slain with the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>. For the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> said, Slay her not in the house of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> So they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the entering of the horse <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> by the king's house, they slew her there.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd200.htm#009">Jehoiada</a> made a <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> between him, and between all the people, and between the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, that they should be the LORD's people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Then all the people went to the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</a>, and brake it down, and brake his altars and his images in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a>, and slew <a href="../ebd/ebd243.htm#007">Mattan</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</a> before the altars.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Also <a href="../ebd/ebd200.htm#009">Jehoiada</a> appointed the offices of the house of the LORD by the hand of the priests the Levites, whom <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> had distributed in the house of the LORD, to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD, as it is written in the law of <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, with rejoicing and with singing, as it was ordained by <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD, that none which was unclean in any thing should enter in.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> from the house of the LORD: and they came through the high <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> into the king's house, and set the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> of the kingdom.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was quiet, after that they had slain <a href="../ebd/ebd036.htm#002">Athaliah</a> with the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>.<br>
