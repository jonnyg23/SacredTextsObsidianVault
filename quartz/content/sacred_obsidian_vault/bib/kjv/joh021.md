 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: John Chapter 21</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> After these things <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#006">Tiberias</a>; and on this <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> shewed he himself.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> There were together <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#005">Thomas</a> called <a href="../ebd/ebd103.htm#006">Didymus</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#003">Nathanael</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#004">Cana</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a>, and the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd388.htm#008">Zebedee</a>, and two other of his disciples.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> But when the morning was now come, <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him, No.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And he said unto them, Cast the <a href="../ebd/ebd271.htm#002">net</a> on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Therefore that <a href="../ebd/ebd104.htm#003">disciple</a> whom <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> loved saith unto <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a>, It is the Lord. Now when <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher's <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#004">coat</a> unto him, (for he was <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</a>,) and did cast himself into the sea.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the <a href="../ebd/ebd271.htm#002">net</a> with fishes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and <a href="../ebd/ebd134.htm#005">fish</a> laid thereon, and <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> saith unto them, Bring of the <a href="../ebd/ebd134.htm#005">fish</a> which ye have now caught.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> went up, and drew the <a href="../ebd/ebd271.htm#002">net</a> to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the <a href="../ebd/ebd271.htm#002">net</a> broken.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> saith unto them, Come and <a href="../ebd/ebd103.htm#009">dine</a>. And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> then cometh, and taketh <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>, and giveth them, and <a href="../ebd/ebd134.htm#005">fish</a> likewise.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> This is now the third time that <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> So when they had dined, <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> saith to <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a>, son of <a href="../ebd/ebd210.htm#009">Jonas</a>, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> He saith to him again the second time, <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a>, son of <a href="../ebd/ebd210.htm#009">Jonas</a>, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> He saith unto him the third time, <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a>, son of <a href="../ebd/ebd210.htm#009">Jonas</a>, lovest thou me? <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> saith unto him, Feed my <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdest thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> This spake he, signifying by what death he should <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#005">glorify</a> God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a>, turning about, seeth the <a href="../ebd/ebd104.htm#003">disciple</a> whom <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> loved following; which also leaned on his breast at <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#004">supper</a>, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> seeing him saith to <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, Lord, and what shall this man do?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that <a href="../ebd/ebd104.htm#003">disciple</a> should not die: yet <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> This is the <a href="../ebd/ebd104.htm#003">disciple</a> which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</a> is true.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And there are also many other things which <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. <a href="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</a>.<br>
