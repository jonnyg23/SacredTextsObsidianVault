 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Corinthians Chapter 4</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a>, we faint not;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#006">conscience</a> in the sight of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> But if our <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a> be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> For we preach not ourselves, but <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> For God, who commanded the light to shine out of <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of God in the face of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, that the life also of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> might be made manifest in our body.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> might be made manifest in our mortal <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> So then death worketh in us, but life in you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> We having the same <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Knowing that he which raised up the Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> shall raise up us also by <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, and shall present us with you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.<br>
