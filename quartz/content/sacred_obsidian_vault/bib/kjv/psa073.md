 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Psalms Chapter 73</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Truly God is good to <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, even to such as are of a <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</a> heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> For there are no <a href="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">bands</a> in their death: but their strength is firm.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like other men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Therefore pride compasseth them about as a <a href="../ebd/ebd075.htm#008">chain</a>; violence covereth them as a garment.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression: they speak loftily.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</a> are wrung out to them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in riches.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against the <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a> of thy children.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Until I went into the <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</a> of God; then understood I their end.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> As a <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a> when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#001">reins</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> before thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me by my right hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Whom have I in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> My <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.<br>
