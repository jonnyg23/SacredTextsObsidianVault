 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Luke Chapter 3</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#002">Caesar</a>, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being <a href="../ebd/ebd363.htm#000">tetrarch</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a>, and his brother <a href="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd363.htm#000">tetrarch</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#008">Ituraea</a> and of the region of <a href="../ebd/ebd371.htm#004">Trachonitis</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd234.htm#001">Lysanias</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd363.htm#000">tetrarch</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd003.htm#008">Abilene</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#007">Annas</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#006">Caiaphas</a> being the high priests, the word of God came unto John the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd386.htm#006">Zacharias</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And he came into all the country about <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a>, preaching the baptism of <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#008">repentance</a> for the remission of sins;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> As it is written in the book of the words of <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#003">Esaias</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>, saying, The voice of one crying in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Every <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a> shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways shall be made smooth;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And all <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> shall see the <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a> of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him, O <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a> of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#008">repentance</a>, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> to our father: for I say unto you, That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And now also the <a href="../ebd/ebd037.htm#003">axe</a> is laid unto the root of the trees: every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> is hewn down, and cast into the fire.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> He answereth and saith unto them, He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him, Master, what shall we do?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And he said unto them, Exact no more than that which is appointed you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#004">wages</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their hearts of John, whether he were the <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, or not;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> John answered, saying unto them all, I indeed baptize you with water; but one mightier than I cometh, the <a href="../ebd/ebd224.htm#006">latchet</a> of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you with the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a> and with fire:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Whose <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#001">fan</a> is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and will gather the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#000">wheat</a> into his <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#005">garner</a>; but the <a href="../ebd/ebd075.htm#007">chaff</a> he will burn with fire unquenchable.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> But Herod the <a href="../ebd/ebd363.htm#000">tetrarch</a>, being reproved by him for <a href="../ebd/ebd176.htm#006">Herodias</a> his brother Philip's wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Added yet this above all, that he shut up John in <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> also being baptized, and praying, the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> was opened,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a> descended in a bodily shape like a <a href="../ebd/ebd106.htm#007">dove</a> upon him, and a voice came from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>, which was the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd172.htm#009">Heli</a>,<br>
