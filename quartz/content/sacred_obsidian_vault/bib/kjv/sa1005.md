 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 5</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> took the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of God, and brought it from Ebenezer unto <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#006">Ashdod</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> When the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> took the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of God, they brought it into the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#000">Dagon</a>, and set it by <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#000">Dagon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And when they of <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#006">Ashdod</a> arose early on the morrow, behold, <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#000">Dagon</a> was fallen upon his face to the earth before the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of the LORD. And they took <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#000">Dagon</a>, and set him in his place again.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#000">Dagon</a> was fallen upon his face to the ground before the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of the LORD; and the head of <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#000">Dagon</a> and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#000">threshold</a>; only the stump of <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#000">Dagon</a> was left to him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Therefore neither the priests of <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#000">Dagon</a>, nor any that come into Dagon's house, tread on the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#000">threshold</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#000">Dagon</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#006">Ashdod</a> unto this day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#006">Ashdod</a>, and he destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, even <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#006">Ashdod</a> and the coasts thereof.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And when the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#006">Ashdod</a> saw that it was so, they said, The <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> shall not abide with us: for his hand is sore upon us, and upon <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#000">Dagon</a> our god.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> unto them, and said, What shall we do with the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>? And they answered, Let the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> be carried about unto <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#009">Gath</a>. And they carried the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> about thither.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of the LORD was against the city with a very great <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a>: and he smote the men of the city, both small and great, and they had emerods in their secret parts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Therefore they sent the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of God to <a href="../ebd/ebd114.htm#001">Ekron</a>. And it came to pass, as the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of God came to <a href="../ebd/ebd114.htm#001">Ekron</a>, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> to us, to slay us and our people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>, and said, Send away the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and let it go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for there was a deadly <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a> throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods: and the cry of the city went up to <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>.<br>
