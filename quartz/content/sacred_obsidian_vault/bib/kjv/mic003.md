 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Micah Chapter 3</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, and ye princes of the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; Is it not for you to know judgment?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> from off their bones;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Who also eat the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> of my people, and flay their skin from off them; and they break their bones, and chop them in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a>, as for the pot, and as <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> within the caldron.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Then shall they cry unto the LORD, but he will not hear them: he will even hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that make my people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Therefore night shall be unto you, that ye shall not have a <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a>; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: yea, they shall all cover their lips; for there is no answer of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> But truly I am full of power by the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> of the LORD, and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> his transgression, and to <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> his <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, and princes of the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> They build up <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a> with <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> with iniquity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> The heads thereof <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they lean upon the LORD, and say, Is not the LORD among us? none evil can come upon us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Therefore shall <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a> for your sake be plowed as a field, and <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#006">forest</a>.<br>
