 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Revelation Chapter 1</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd312.htm#002">Revelation</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> unto his servant John:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Who bare record of the word of God, and of the <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, and of all things that he saw.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#007">prophecy</a>, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> John to the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> churches which are in <a href="../ebd/ebd034.htm#008">Asia</a>: <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">Grace</a> be unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> Spirits which are before his <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And from <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, who is the <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a>, and the first begotten of the dead, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</a> of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> and dominion for ever and ever. <a href="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, <a href="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> I am Alpha and <a href="../ebd/ebd278.htm#004">Omega</a>, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> I John, who also am your brother, and companion in <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#005">tribulation</a>, and in the kingdom and patience of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, was in the isle that is called <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#008">Patmos</a>, for the word of God, and for the <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> I was in the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Saying, I am Alpha and <a href="../ebd/ebd278.htm#004">Omega</a>, the first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> churches which are in <a href="../ebd/ebd034.htm#008">Asia</a>; unto <a href="../ebd/ebd122.htm#007">Ephesus</a>, and unto <a href="../ebd/ebd346.htm#007">Smyrna</a>, and unto <a href="../ebd/ebd290.htm#004">Pergamos</a>, and unto <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#004">Thyatira</a>, and unto <a href="../ebd/ebd322.htm#006">Sardis</a>, and unto <a href="../ebd/ebd293.htm#004">Philadelphia</a>, and unto <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#009">Laodicea</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> golden candlesticks;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And in the midst of the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#005">girdle</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> His head and his hairs were white like <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#005">wool</a>, as white as <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#000">snow</a>; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And his feet like unto fine <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a>, as if they burned in a <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#000">furnace</a>; and his voice as the sound of many waters.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And he had in his right hand <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd350.htm#008">stars</a>: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>: and his countenance was as the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> shineth in his strength.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, <a href="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</a>; and have the keys of <a href="../ebd/ebd173.htm#003">hell</a> and of death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd263.htm#006">mystery</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd350.htm#008">stars</a> which thou sawest in my right hand, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> golden candlesticks. The <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd350.htm#008">stars</a> are the angels of the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> churches: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> candlesticks which thou sawest are the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> churches.<br>
