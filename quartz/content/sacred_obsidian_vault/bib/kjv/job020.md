 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 20</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then answered <a href="../ebd/ebd396.htm#000">Zophar</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd264.htm#000">Naamathite</a>, and said,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for this I make haste.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> I have heard the check of my reproach, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> of my understanding causeth me to answer.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Knowest thou not this of old, since man was placed upon earth,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the <a href="../ebd/ebd185.htm#006">hypocrite</a> but for a moment?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Though his excellency <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Yet he shall perish for ever like his own <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#003">dung</a>: they which have seen him shall say, Where is he?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> He shall <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#004">fly</a> away as a <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a>, and shall not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a> of the night.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> The eye also which saw him shall see him no more; neither shall his place any more behold him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> His children shall seek to please the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>, and his hands shall restore their goods.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> His bones are full of the <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Though he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Yet his meat in his <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#004">bowels</a> is turned, it is the <a href="../ebd/ebd142.htm#000">gall</a> of asps within him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> He shall suck the <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#009">poison</a> of asps: the viper's tongue shall slay him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of <a href="../ebd/ebd181.htm#001">honey</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd067.htm#002">butter</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#009">swallow</a> it down: according to his substance shall the restitution be, and he shall not rejoice therein.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>; because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Surely he shall not feel quietness in his <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</a>, he shall not save of that which he desired.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> In the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#007">fulness</a> of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> When he is about to fill his <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</a>, God shall cast the <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</a> of his wrath upon him, and shall <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a> it upon him while he is <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#006">eating</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> He shall flee from the <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a> weapon, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#000">steel</a> shall strike him through.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> cometh out of his <a href="../ebd/ebd142.htm#000">gall</a>: terrors are upon him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> All <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a> shall be hid in his secret places: a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> The increase of his house shall depart, and his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God.<br>
