 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Exodus Chapter 5</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And afterward <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a> went in, and told <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, Thus saith the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, Let my people go, that they may hold a <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a> unto me in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice to let <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> go.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And they said, The God of the <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#001">Hebrews</a> hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days' <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</a> into the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#000">desert</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> unto the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> said unto them, Wherefore do ye, <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a>, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and ye make them rest from their burdens.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Ye shall no more give the people <a href="../ebd/ebd352.htm#000">straw</a> to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather <a href="../ebd/ebd352.htm#000">straw</a> for themselves.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd357.htm#008">tale</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#000">bricks</a>, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> to our God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard vain words.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, I will not give you <a href="../ebd/ebd352.htm#000">straw</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Go ye, get you <a href="../ebd/ebd352.htm#000">straw</a> where ye can find it: yet not ought of your work shall be diminished.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> to gather stubble instead of <a href="../ebd/ebd352.htm#000">straw</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, your daily tasks, as when there was <a href="../ebd/ebd352.htm#000">straw</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And the officers of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, which Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Then the officers of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> came and cried unto <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> There is no <a href="../ebd/ebd352.htm#000">straw</a> given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault is in thine own people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go and do <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> to the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no <a href="../ebd/ebd352.htm#000">straw</a> be given you, yet shall ye deliver the <a href="../ebd/ebd357.htm#008">tale</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#000">bricks</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And the officers of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> did see that they were in evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish ought from your <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#000">bricks</a> of your daily task.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And they met <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a>, who stood in the way, as they came forth from <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And they said unto them, The LORD look upon you, and <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a>; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> in their hand to slay us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> returned unto the LORD, and said, LORD, wherefore hast thou so evil entreated this people? why is it that thou hast sent me?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> For since I came to <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.<br>
