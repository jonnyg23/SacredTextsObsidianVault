 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Psalms Chapter 7</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a>, while there is none to deliver.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> O LORD my God, If I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a>. <a href="../ebd/ebd326.htm#008">Selah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Arise, O LORD, in thine <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>, lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> So shall the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a> of the people compass thee about: for their sakes therefore return thou on high.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> The LORD shall <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> the people: <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> me, O LORD, according to my <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>, and according to mine integrity that is in me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#001">reins</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> My defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> If he turn not, he will whet his <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>; he hath bent his <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a>, and made it ready.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his <a href="../ebd/ebd032.htm#005">arrows</a> against the persecutors.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> He made a <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a>, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> I will praise the LORD according to his <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.<br>
