 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 4</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> If thou wilt return, O <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, saith the LORD, return unto me: and if thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight, then shalt thou not remove.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And thou shalt swear, The LORD liveth, in truth, in judgment, and in <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>; and the nations shall <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a> themselves in him, and in him shall they <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> For thus saith the LORD to the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, and take away the foreskins of your heart, ye men of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> and inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>: lest my <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</a> come forth like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Declare ye in <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and publish in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>; and say, Blow ye the trumpet in the land: cry, gather together, and say, Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the defenced cities.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Set up the standard toward <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a>: retire, stay not: for I will bring evil from the north, and a great <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> The lion is come up from his thicket, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#003">destroyer</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a> is on his way; he is gone forth from his place to make thy land desolate; and thy cities shall be laid waste, without an inhabitant.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> For this gird you with <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#001">sackcloth</a>, lament and howl: for the fierce <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> of the LORD is not turned back from us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And it shall come to pass at that day, saith the LORD, that the heart of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> shall perish, and the heart of the princes; and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall wonder.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! surely thou hast greatly deceived this people and <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, saying, Ye shall have peace; whereas the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> reacheth unto the soul.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> At that time shall it be said to this people and to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, A dry wind of the high places in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> toward the daughter of my people, not to <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#001">fan</a>, nor to cleanse,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Even a full wind from those places shall come unto me: now also will I give sentence against them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots shall be as a whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe unto us! for we are spoiled.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> O <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, wash thine heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be saved. How long shall thy vain thoughts <a href="../ebd/ebd231.htm#002">lodge</a> within thee?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> For a voice declareth from <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#009">Dan</a>, and publisheth affliction from <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Make ye mention to the nations; behold, publish against <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, that watchers come from a far country, and give out their voice against the cities of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> As keepers of a field, are they against her round about; because she hath been rebellious against me, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee; this is thy wickedness, because it is <a href="../ebd/ebd059.htm#009">bitter</a>, because it reacheth unto thine heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> My <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#004">bowels</a>, my <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#004">bowels</a>! I am pained at my very heart; my heart maketh a noise in me; I cannot hold my peace, because thou hast heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the <a href="../ebd/ebd016.htm#007">alarm</a> of war.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">Destruction</a> upon <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a> is cried; for the whole land is spoiled: suddenly are my tents spoiled, and my curtains in a moment.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the trumpet?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> For my people is foolish, they have not known me; they are sottish children, and they have none understanding: they are <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void; and the heavens, and they had no light.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved lightly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the LORD, and by his fierce <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> For thus hath the LORD said, The whole land shall be desolate; yet will I not make a full end.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> For this shall the earth <a href="../ebd/ebd261.htm#004">mourn</a>, and the heavens above be black; because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and will not repent, neither will I turn back from it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen; they shall go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every city shall be forsaken, and not a man dwell therein.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And when thou art spoiled, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothest thyself with <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#007">crimson</a>, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, though thou rentest thy face with painting, in vain shalt thou make thyself fair; thy lovers will despise thee, they will seek thy life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, and the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a>, that bewaileth herself, that spreadeth her hands, saying, Woe is me now! for my soul is wearied because of murderers.<br>
