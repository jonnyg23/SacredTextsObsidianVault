 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 21</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then there was a <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a> in the days of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> three years, year after year; and <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> enquired of the LORD. And the LORD answered, It is for <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, but of the remnant of the <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#006">Amorites</a>; and the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> had sworn unto them: and <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> sought to slay them in his <a href="../ebd/ebd388.htm#003">zeal</a> to the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>.)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Wherefore <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you?  and wherewith shall I make the <a href="../ebd/ebd036.htm#004">atonement</a>, that ye may <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a> the inheritance of the LORD?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And the Gibeonites said unto him, We will have no <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> nor <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, nor of his house; neither for us shalt thou kill any man in <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>. And he said, What ye shall say, that will I do for you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And they answered the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the coasts of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Let <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them up unto the LORD in <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#008">Gibeah</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, whom the LORD did choose. And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said, I will give them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> But the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> spared <a href="../ebd/ebd248.htm#006">Mephibosheth</a>, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, because of the LORD's <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</a> that was between them, between <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> But the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> took the two sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd314.htm#008">Rizpah</a> the daughter of Aiah, whom she bare unto <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#005">Armoni</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd248.htm#006">Mephibosheth</a>; and the five sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#001">Michal</a> the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, whom she brought up for <a href="../ebd/ebd010.htm#006">Adriel</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd046.htm#002">Barzillai</a> the Meholathite:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the hill before the LORD: and they fell all <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> together, and were put to death in the days of <a href="../ebd/ebd165.htm#008">harvest</a>, in the first days, in the beginning of <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#003">barley</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd165.htm#008">harvest</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd314.htm#008">Rizpah</a> the daughter of Aiah took <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#001">sackcloth</a>, and spread it for her upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a>, from the beginning of <a href="../ebd/ebd165.htm#008">harvest</a> until water dropped upon them out of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And it was told <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> what <a href="../ebd/ebd314.htm#008">Rizpah</a> the daughter of Aiah, the <a href="../ebd/ebd087.htm#007">concubine</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, had done.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> went and took the bones of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> and the bones of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> his son from the men of Jabeshgilead, which had stolen them from the street of Bethshan, where the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> had hanged them, when the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> had slain <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#008">Gilboa</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And he brought up from thence the bones of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> and the bones of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> his son; and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And the bones of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> his son buried they in the country of <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd390.htm#000">Zelah</a>, in the <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd220.htm#007">Kish</a> his father: and they performed all that the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> commanded. And after that God was intreated for the land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Moreover the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> had yet war again with <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; and <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> waxed faint.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And Ishbibenob, which was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a> in weight, he being girded with a new <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, thought to have slain <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd004.htm#005">Abishai</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd391.htm#009">Zeruiah</a> succoured him, and smote the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> sware unto him, saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench not the light of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle with the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> at <a href="../ebd/ebd151.htm#003">Gob</a>: then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#009">Saph</a>, which was of the sons of the giant.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And there was again a battle in <a href="../ebd/ebd151.htm#003">Gob</a> with the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>, where <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#006">Elhanan</a> the son of Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the brother of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#005">Goliath</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#009">Gittite</a>, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's <a href="../ebd/ebd048.htm#007">beam</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And there was yet a battle in <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#009">Gath</a>, where was a man of great stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And when he defied <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd338.htm#001">Shimeah</a> the brother of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> slew him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> These four were born to the giant in <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#009">Gath</a>, and fell by the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, and by the hand of his servants.<br>
