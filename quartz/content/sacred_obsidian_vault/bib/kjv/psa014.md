 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Psalms Chapter 14</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> The LORD looked down from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy: there is none that doeth good, no, not one.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>, and call not upon the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> There were they in great fear: for God is in the <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a> of the righteous.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Ye have shamed the counsel of the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>, because the LORD is his refuge.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Oh that the <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> were come out of <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a>! when the LORD bringeth back the <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a> of his people, <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> shall rejoice, and <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> shall be glad.<br>
