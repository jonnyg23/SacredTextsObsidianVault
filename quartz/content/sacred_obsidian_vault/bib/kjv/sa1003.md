 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 3</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And the child <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> ministered unto the LORD before <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</a>. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And it came to pass at that time, when <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</a> was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to <a href="../ebd/ebd380.htm#000">wax</a> dim, that he could not see;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And ere the <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#007">lamp</a> of God went out in the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> of the LORD, where the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of God was, and <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> was laid down to sleep;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> That the LORD called <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a>: and he answered, Here am I.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And he ran unto <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</a>, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And the LORD called yet again, <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a>. And <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> arose and went to <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</a>, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Now <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And the LORD called <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> again the third time. And he arose and went to <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</a>, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</a> perceived that the LORD had called the child.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Therefore <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a>, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> went and lay down in his place.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a>. Then <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And the LORD said to <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a>, Behold, I will do a thing in <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> In that day I will perform against <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</a> all things which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> For I have told him that I will <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And therefore I have sworn unto the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</a>, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> nor <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> lay until the morning, and opened the <a href="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</a> of the house of the LORD. And <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> feared to shew <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</a> called <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a>, and said, <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a>, my son. And he answered, Here am I.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> from <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#009">Dan</a> even to <a href="../ebd/ebd050.htm#008">Beersheba</a> knew that <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> was established to be a <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And the LORD appeared again in <a href="../ebd/ebd337.htm#008">Shiloh</a>: for the LORD revealed himself to <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd337.htm#008">Shiloh</a> by the word of the LORD.<br>
