 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Exodus Chapter 2</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And there went a man of the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#006">Levi</a>, and took to wife a daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#006">Levi</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of bulrushes, and daubed it with <a href="../ebd/ebd346.htm#004">slime</a> and with <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#008">pitch</a>, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> came down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the <a href="../ebd/ebd040.htm#009">babe</a> wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#009">Hebrew</a> women, that she may nurse the child for thee?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#004">wages</a>. And the women took the child, and nursed it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And it came to pass in those days, when <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#009">Hebrew</a>, one of his brethren.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#001">Hebrews</a> strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And he said, Who made thee a <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</a> and a <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Now when <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> heard this thing, he sought to slay <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>. But <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> fled from the face of <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, and dwelt in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#007">Midian</a>: and he sat down by a well.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Now the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#007">Midian</a> had <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And the shepherds came and drove them away: but <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And when they came to <a href="../ebd/ebd312.htm#001">Reuel</a> their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to day?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> was content to dwell with the man: and he gave <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#008">Zipporah</a> his daughter.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And she bare him a son, and he called his name <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#008">Gershom</a>: for he said, I have been a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a> in a strange land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And it came to pass in process of time, that the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> died: and the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> sighed by reason of the <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#002">bondage</a>, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#002">bondage</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> with <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, with <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a>, and with <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And God looked upon the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and God had respect unto them.<br>
