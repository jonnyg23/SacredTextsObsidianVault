 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Genesis Chapter 9</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And God blessed <a href="../ebd/ebd274.htm#002">Noah</a> and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green <a href="../ebd/ebd174.htm#008">herb</a> have I given you all things.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> with the life thereof, which is the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> thereof, shall ye not eat.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And surely your <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of your lives will I require; at the hand of every <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Whoso sheddeth man's <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>, by man shall his <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> be shed: for in the image of God made he man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And God spake unto <a href="../ebd/ebd274.htm#002">Noah</a>, and to his sons with him, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And I, behold, I establish my <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> with you, and with your seed after you;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And with every living <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#004">creature</a> that is with you, of the fowl, of the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a>, and of every <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> of the earth with you; from all that go out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a>, to every <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> of the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And I will establish my <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> with you, neither shall all <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> be cut off any more by the waters of a <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#000">flood</a>; neither shall there any more be a <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#000">flood</a> to destroy the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And God said, This is the token of the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> which I make between me and you and every living <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#004">creature</a> that is with you, for perpetual generations:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> I do set my <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a>, and it shall be for a token of a <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> between me and the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And it shall come to pass, when I bring a <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a> over the earth, that the <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a> shall be seen in the <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And I will remember my <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a>, which is between me and you and every living <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#004">creature</a> of all <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>; and the waters shall no more become a <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#000">flood</a> to destroy all <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a> shall be in the <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a>; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> between God and every living <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#004">creature</a> of all <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> that is upon the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And God said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd274.htm#002">Noah</a>, This is the token of the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a>, which I have established between me and all <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> that is upon the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd274.htm#002">Noah</a>, that went forth of the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a>, were <a href="../ebd/ebd334.htm#002">Shem</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd160.htm#003">Ham</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd197.htm#002">Japheth</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd160.htm#003">Ham</a> is the father of <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> These are the three sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd274.htm#002">Noah</a>: and of them was the whole earth overspread.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd274.htm#002">Noah</a> began to be an <a href="../ebd/ebd185.htm#002">husbandman</a>, and he planted a vineyard:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And he drank of the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd160.htm#003">Ham</a>, the father of <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</a>, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd334.htm#002">Shem</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd197.htm#002">Japheth</a> took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd274.htm#002">Noah</a> awoke from his <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>, and knew what his younger son had done unto him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And he said, Cursed be <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</a>; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd334.htm#002">Shem</a>; and <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</a> shall be his servant.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> God shall enlarge <a href="../ebd/ebd197.htm#002">Japheth</a>, and he shall dwell in the tents of <a href="../ebd/ebd334.htm#002">Shem</a>; and <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</a> shall be his servant.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd274.htm#002">Noah</a> lived after the <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#000">flood</a> three hundred and fifty years.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And all the days of <a href="../ebd/ebd274.htm#002">Noah</a> were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.<br>
