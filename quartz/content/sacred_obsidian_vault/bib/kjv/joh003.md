 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: John Chapter 3</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> There was a man of the <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a>, named <a href="../ebd/ebd272.htm#005">Nicodemus</a>, a ruler of the Jews:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> The same came to <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> by night, and said unto him, <a href="../ebd/ebd304.htm#006">Rabbi</a>, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd272.htm#005">Nicodemus</a> saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a>, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> That which is born of the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> is <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>; and that which is born of the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> is <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd272.htm#005">Nicodemus</a> answered and said unto him, How can these things be?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and knowest not these things?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And no man hath ascended up to <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, but he that came down from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, even the Son of man which is in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And as <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> lifted up the <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#009">serpent</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a> rather than light, because their deeds were evil.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> After these things came <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And John also was baptizing in <a href="../ebd/ebd011.htm#003">Aenon</a> near to <a href="../ebd/ebd319.htm#002">Salim</a>, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> For John was not yet cast into <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And they came unto John, and said unto him, <a href="../ebd/ebd304.htm#006">Rabbi</a>, he that was with thee beyond <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a>, to whom thou barest <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a>, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Ye yourselves bear me <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a>, that I said, I am not the <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, but that I am sent before him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> He that hath the <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#001">bride</a> is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> He must increase, but I must decrease.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> is above all.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> He that hath received his <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</a> hath set to his <a href="../ebd/ebd325.htm#002">seal</a> that God is true.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> by measure unto him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> He that believeth on the Son hath <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.<br>
