 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Hosea Chapter 4</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: for the LORD hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a>, nor knowledge of God in the land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> By swearing, and lying, and killing, and <a href="../ebd/ebd352.htm#001">stealing</a>, and committing <a href="../ebd/ebd010.htm#009">adultery</a>, they break out, and <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> toucheth <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Therefore shall the land <a href="../ebd/ebd261.htm#004">mourn</a>, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people are as they that strive with the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> also shall fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy mother.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> As they were increased, so they sinned against me: therefore will I change their <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> into shame.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> They eat up the <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And there shall be, like people, like <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>: and I will punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed to the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Whoredom and <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> and new <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> take away the heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth unto them: for the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> of whoredoms hath caused them to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> They <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> upon the tops of the mountains, and burn <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a> upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</a> thereof is good: therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit <a href="../ebd/ebd010.htm#009">adultery</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit <a href="../ebd/ebd010.htm#009">adultery</a>: for themselves are separated with whores, and they <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> with harlots: therefore the people that doth not understand shall fall.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Though thou, <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, play the <a href="../ebd/ebd164.htm#005">harlot</a>, yet let not <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> offend; and come not ye unto <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#001">Gilgal</a>, neither go ye up to Bethaven, nor swear, The LORD liveth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> For <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> slideth back as a backsliding <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#006">heifer</a>: now the LORD will feed them as a <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">lamb</a> in a large place.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a> is joined to idols: let him alone.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Their <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> is sour: they have committed whoredom continually: her rulers with shame do love, Give ye.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.<br>
