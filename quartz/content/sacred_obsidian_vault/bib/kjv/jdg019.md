 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Judges Chapter 19</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And it came to pass in those days, when there was no <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, that there was a certain <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#009">Levite</a> sojourning on the side of <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a>, who took to him a <a href="../ebd/ebd087.htm#007">concubine</a> out of Bethlehemjudah.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And his <a href="../ebd/ebd087.htm#007">concubine</a> played the whore against him, and went away from him unto her father's house to Bethlehemjudah, and was there four whole months.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly unto her, and to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple of asses: and she brought him into her father's house: and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And his father in law, the damsel's father, retained him; and he abode with him three days: so they did eat and <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>, and lodged there.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early in the morning, that he rose up to depart: and the damsel's father said unto his son in law, Comfort thine heart with a morsel of <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>, and afterward go your way.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And they sat down, and did eat and <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> both of them together: for the damsel's father had said unto the man, Be content, I pray thee, and tarry all night, and let thine heart be merry.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And when the man rose up to depart, his father in law urged him: therefore he lodged there again.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and the damsel's father said, Comfort thine heart, I pray thee. And they tarried until afternoon, and they did eat both of them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his <a href="../ebd/ebd087.htm#007">concubine</a>, and his servant, his father in law, the damsel's father, said unto him, Behold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you tarry all night: behold, the day groweth to an end, <a href="../ebd/ebd231.htm#002">lodge</a> here, that thine heart may be merry; and to morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against <a href="../ebd/ebd199.htm#003">Jebus</a>, which is <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>; and there were with him two asses saddled, his <a href="../ebd/ebd087.htm#007">concubine</a> also was with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And when they were by <a href="../ebd/ebd199.htm#003">Jebus</a>, the day was far spent; and the servant said unto his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn in into this city of the <a href="../ebd/ebd199.htm#004">Jebusites</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd231.htm#002">lodge</a> in it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And his master said unto him, We will not turn aside hither into the city of a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a>, that is not of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; we will pass over to <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#008">Gibeah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And he said unto his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one of these places to <a href="../ebd/ebd231.htm#002">lodge</a> all night, in <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#008">Gibeah</a>, or in <a href="../ebd/ebd306.htm#005">Ramah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And they passed on and went their way; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> went down upon them when they were by <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#008">Gibeah</a>, which belongeth to <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And they turned aside thither, to go in and to <a href="../ebd/ebd231.htm#002">lodge</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#008">Gibeah</a>: and when he went in, he sat him down in a street of the city: for there was no man that took them into his house to lodging.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even, which was also of <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a>; and he sojourned in <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#008">Gibeah</a>: but the men of the place were Benjamites.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man in the street of the city: and the old man said, Whither goest thou? and whence comest thou?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And he said unto him, We are passing from Bethlehemjudah toward the side of <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a>; from thence am I: and I went to Bethlehemjudah, but I am now going to the house of the LORD; and there is no man that receiveth me to house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Yet there is both <a href="../ebd/ebd352.htm#000">straw</a> and provender for our asses; and there is <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> also for me, and for thy <a href="../ebd/ebd162.htm#008">handmaid</a>, and for the young man which is with thy servants: there is no want of any thing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And the old man said, Peace be with thee; howsoever let all thy wants lie upon me; only <a href="../ebd/ebd231.htm#002">lodge</a> not in the street.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> So he brought him into his house, and gave provender unto the asses: and they washed their feet, and did eat and <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd051.htm#007">Belial</a>, beset the house round about, and beat at the door, and spake to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into thine house, that we may know him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and said unto them, Nay, my brethren, nay, I pray you, do not so wickedly; seeing that this man is come into mine house, do not this folly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Behold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his <a href="../ebd/ebd087.htm#007">concubine</a>; them I will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth good unto you: but unto this man do not so vile a thing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his <a href="../ebd/ebd087.htm#007">concubine</a>, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord was, till it was light.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the <a href="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</a> of the house, and went out to go his way: and, behold, the woman his <a href="../ebd/ebd087.htm#007">concubine</a> was fallen down at the door of the house, and her hands were upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#000">threshold</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going. But none answered. Then the man took her up upon an <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</a>, and the man rose up, and gat him unto his place.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And when he was come into his house, he took a <a href="../ebd/ebd221.htm#007">knife</a>, and laid hold on his <a href="../ebd/ebd087.htm#007">concubine</a>, and divided her, together with her bones, into twelve <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a>, and sent her into all the coasts of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> came up out of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> unto this day: consider of it, take advice, and speak your minds.<br>
