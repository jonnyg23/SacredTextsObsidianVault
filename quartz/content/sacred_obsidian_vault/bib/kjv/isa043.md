 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 43</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> But now thus saith the LORD that created thee, O <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, and he that formed thee, O <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name; thou art mine.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> For I am the LORD thy God, the Holy One of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, thy <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#003">Saviour</a>: I gave <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> for thy <a href="../ebd/ebd307.htm#005">ransom</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd126.htm#005">Ethiopia</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd325.htm#004">Seba</a> for thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been honourable, and I have loved thee: therefore will I give men for thee, and people for thy life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Fear not: for I am with thee: I will bring thy seed from the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a>, and gather thee from the west;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Even every one that is called by my name: for I have created him for my <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>, I have formed him; yea, I have made him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Bring forth the <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a> people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled: who among them can declare this, and shew us former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: or let them hear, and say, It is truth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a>: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> I, even I, am the LORD; and beside me there is no <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#003">saviour</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when there was no strange god among you: therefore ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, that I am God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Yea, before the day was I am he; and there is none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Thus saith the LORD, your <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#008">redeemer</a>, the Holy One of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; For your sake I have sent to <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, and have brought down all their nobles, and the Chaldeans, whose cry is in the <a href="../ebd/ebd339.htm#003">ships</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> I am the LORD, your Holy One, the creator of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, your <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Thus saith the LORD, which maketh a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Which bringeth forth the <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</a> and horse, the army and the power; they shall lie down together, they shall not rise: they are extinct, they are quenched as <a href="../ebd/ebd371.htm#001">tow</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, and rivers in the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#000">desert</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the owls: because I give waters in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, and rivers in the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#000">desert</a>, to give <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> to my people, my <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> But thou hast not called upon me, O <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>; but thou hast been weary of me, O <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Thou hast not brought me the small <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a> of thy burnt offerings; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices. I have not caused thee to serve with an <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a>, nor wearied thee with <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Thou hast bought me no sweet <a href="../ebd/ebd071.htm#002">cane</a> with money, neither hast thou filled me with the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</a> of thy sacrifices: but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou, that thou mayest be justified.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Thy first father hath sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed against me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Therefore I have profaned the princes of the <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</a>, and have given <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> to the <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> to reproaches.<br>
