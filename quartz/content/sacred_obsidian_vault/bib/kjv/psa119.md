 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, and that seek him with the whole heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> They also do no iniquity: they walk in his ways.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy commandments.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have learned thy righteous judgments.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> I will keep thy statutes: O forsake me not utterly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wander from thy commandments.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> against thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Blessed art thou, O LORD: teach me thy statutes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in all riches.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy ways.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy word.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Deal bountifully with thy servant, that I may live, and keep thy word.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> I am a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a> in the earth: hide not thy commandments from me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy judgments at all times.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed, which do err from thy commandments.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept thy testimonies.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Princes also did sit and speak against me: but thy servant did meditate in thy statutes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Thy testimonies also are my delight and my counsellors.leth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> My soul cleaveth unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a>: quicken thou me according to thy word.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> I have declared my ways, and thou heardest me: teach me thy statutes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: so shall I talk of thy wondrous works.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me according unto thy word.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Remove from me the way of lying: and grant me thy law graciously.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> I have <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> the way of truth: thy judgments have I laid before me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> I have stuck unto thy testimonies: O LORD, put me not to shame.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Teach me, O LORD, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it unto the end.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall observe it with my whole heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; for therein do I delight.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#000">covetousness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; and quicken thou me in thy way.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> Stablish thy word unto thy servant, who is devoted to thy fear.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> Turn away my reproach which I fear: for thy judgments are good.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> Let thy mercies come also unto me, O LORD, even thy <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a>, according to thy word.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me: for I trust in thy word.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I have hoped in thy judgments.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> And I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="046">46</a> I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will not be ashamed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="047">47</a> And I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have loved.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="048">48</a> My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I have loved; and I will meditate in thy statutes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="049">49</a> Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me to hope.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="050">50</a> This is my comfort in my affliction: for thy word hath quickened me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="051">51</a> The proud have had me greatly in derision: yet have I not declined from thy law.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="052">52</a> I remembered thy judgments of old, O LORD; and have comforted myself.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="053">53</a> Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake thy law.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="054">54</a> Thy statutes have been my <a href="../ebd/ebd348.htm#002">songs</a> in the house of my pilgrimage.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="055">55</a> I have remembered thy name, O LORD, in the night, and have kept thy law.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="056">56</a> This I had, because I kept thy precepts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="057">57</a> Thou art my portion, O LORD: I have said that I would keep thy words.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="058">58</a> I intreated thy favour with my whole heart: be merciful unto me according to thy word.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="059">59</a> I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="060">60</a> I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="061">61</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">bands</a> of the wicked have robbed me: but I have not forgotten thy law.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="062">62</a> At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy righteous judgments.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="063">63</a> I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="064">64</a> The earth, O LORD, is full of thy <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a>: teach me thy statutes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="065">65</a> Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O LORD, according unto thy word.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="066">66</a> Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thy commandments.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="067">67</a> Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy word.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="068">68</a> Thou art good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="069">69</a> The proud have forged a lie against me: but I will keep thy precepts with my whole heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="070">70</a> Their heart is as <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</a> as grease; but I delight in thy law.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="071">71</a> It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="072">72</a> The law of thy mouth is better unto me than <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="073">73</a> Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="074">74</a> They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I have hoped in thy word.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="075">75</a> I know, O LORD, that thy judgments are right, and that thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="076">76</a> Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort, according to thy word unto thy servant.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="077">77</a> Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy law is my delight.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="078">78</a> Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me without a cause: but I will meditate in thy precepts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="079">79</a> Let those that fear thee turn unto me, and those that have known thy testimonies.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="080">80</a> Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="081">81</a> My soul fainteth for thy <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a>: but I hope in thy word.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="082">82</a> Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="083">83</a> For I am become like a <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#002">bottle</a> in the smoke; yet do I not forget thy statutes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="084">84</a> How many are the days of thy servant? when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="085">85</a> The proud have digged pits for me, which are not after thy law.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="086">86</a> All thy commandments are <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a>: they persecute me wrongfully; help thou me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="087">87</a> They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy precepts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="088">88</a> Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep the <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</a> of thy mouth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="089">89</a> For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="090">90</a> Thy faithfulness is unto all generations: thou hast established the earth, and it abideth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="091">91</a> They continue this day according to thine ordinances: for all are thy servants.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="092">92</a> Unless thy law had been my delights, I should then have perished in mine affliction.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="093">93</a> I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast quickened me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="094">94</a> I am thine, save me: for I have sought thy precepts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="095">95</a> The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: but I will consider thy testimonies.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="096">96</a> I have seen an end of all <a href="../ebd/ebd290.htm#001">perfection</a>: but thy commandment is exceeding broad.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="097">97</a> O how I love thy law! it is my meditation all the day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="098">98</a> Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies: for they are ever with me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="099">99</a> I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies are my meditation.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="100">100</a> I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy precepts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="101">101</a> I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy word.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="102">102</a> I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="103">103</a> How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than <a href="../ebd/ebd181.htm#001">honey</a> to my mouth!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="104">104</a> Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="105">105</a> Thy word is a <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#007">lamp</a> unto my feet, and a light unto my path.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="106">106</a> I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous judgments.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="107">107</a> I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O LORD, according unto thy word.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="108">108</a> Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O LORD, and teach me thy judgments.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="109">109</a> My soul is continually in my hand: yet do I not forget thy law.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="110">110</a> The wicked have laid a <a href="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</a> for me: yet I erred not from thy precepts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="111">111</a> Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they are the rejoicing of my heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="112">112</a> I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway, even unto the end.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="113">113</a> I hate vain thoughts: but thy law do I love.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="114">114</a> Thou art my hiding place and my <a href="../ebd/ebd337.htm#001">shield</a>: I hope in thy word.<br>

 <p><a name="115">115</a> Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the commandments of my God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="116">116</a> Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me not be ashamed of my hope.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="117">117</a> Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="118">118</a> Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes: for their deceit is falsehood.<br>
 </p>

 </p>
 <p><a name="120">120</a> My <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy judgments.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="121">121</a> I have done judgment and <a href="../ebd/ebd214.htm#007">justice</a>: leave me not to mine oppressors.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="122">122</a> Be <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#005">surety</a> for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress me.<br>

 </p>
 <p><a name="168">168</a> I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies: for all my ways are before thee.<br>
