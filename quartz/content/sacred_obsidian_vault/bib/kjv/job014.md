 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 14</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</a>, and continueth not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And doth thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest me into judgment with thee?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Who can bring a <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</a> thing out of an unclean? not one.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#004">hireling</a>, his day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#002">branch</a> thereof will not cease.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Though the root thereof <a href="../ebd/ebd380.htm#000">wax</a> old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">ghost</a>, and where is he?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> As the waters fail from the sea, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#000">flood</a> decayeth and drieth up:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> O that thou wouldest hide me in the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</a>, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> My transgression is sealed up in a <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#008">bag</a>, and thou sewest up mine iniquity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And surely the mountains falling cometh to nought, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a> is removed out of his place.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which grow out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a> of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> But his <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall <a href="../ebd/ebd261.htm#004">mourn</a>.<br>
