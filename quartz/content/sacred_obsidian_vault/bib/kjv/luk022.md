 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Luke Chapter 22</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now the <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a> of unleavened <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> drew nigh, which is called the <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">Passover</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And the chief priests and <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</a> sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Then entered <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</a> into <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#001">Judas</a> surnamed <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#000">Iscariot</a>, being of the number of the twelve.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him unto them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Then came the day of unleavened <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>, when the <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</a> must be killed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And he sent <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> and John, saying, Go and prepare us the <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</a>, that we may eat.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#009">pitcher</a> of water; follow him into the house where he entereth in.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</a> with my disciples?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished: there make ready.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</a> with you before I suffer:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And he took the <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</a>, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> For I say unto you, I will not <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</a>, until the kingdom of God shall come.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And he took <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Likewise also the <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</a> after <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#004">supper</a>, saying, This <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</a> is the new <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#007">testament</a> in my <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>, which is shed for you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And they began to enquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And he said unto them, The kings of the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a> exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth?  is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> That ye may eat and <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And the Lord said, <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a>, behold, <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</a> hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#000">wheat</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a>, and to death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> And he said, I tell thee, <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a>, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And he said unto them, When I sent you without <a href="../ebd/ebd302.htm#008">purse</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#004">scrip</a>, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a <a href="../ebd/ebd302.htm#008">purse</a>, let him take it, and likewise his <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#004">scrip</a>: and he that hath no <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, let him sell his garment, and buy one.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> of Olives; and his disciples also followed him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#008">temptation</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</a> from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> And there appeared an <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> unto him from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, strengthening him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> And being in an <a href="../ebd/ebd012.htm#003">agony</a> he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> falling down to the ground.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> And when he rose up from <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a>, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="046">46</a> And said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#008">temptation</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="047">47</a> And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#001">Judas</a>, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd221.htm#000">kiss</a> him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="048">48</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> said unto him, <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#001">Judas</a>, betrayest thou the Son of man with a <a href="../ebd/ebd221.htm#000">kiss</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="049">49</a> When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="050">50</a> And one of them smote the servant of the high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, and cut off his right <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="051">51</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a>, and healed him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="052">52</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> said unto the chief priests, and captains of the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="053">53</a> When I was daily with you in the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="054">54</a> Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high priest's house. And <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> followed afar off.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="055">55</a> And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> sat down among them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="056">56</a> But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="057">57</a> And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="058">58</a> And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> said, Man, I am not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="059">59</a> And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him: for he is a Galilaean.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="060">60</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="061">61</a> And the Lord turned, and looked upon <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a>. And <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="062">62</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> went out, and wept bitterly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="063">63</a> And the men that held <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> mocked him, and smote him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="064">64</a> And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="065">65</a> And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="066">66</a> And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</a> came together, and led him into their <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#004">council</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="067">67</a> Art thou the <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="068">68</a> And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="069">69</a> Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="070">70</a> Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="071">71</a> And they said, What need we any further <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a>? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth.<br>
