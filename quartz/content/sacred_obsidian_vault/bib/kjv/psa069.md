 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Psalms Chapter 69</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> I sink in <a href="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</a> mire, where there is no standing: I am come into <a href="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</a> waters, where the floods overflow me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored that which I took not away.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> I am become a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a> unto my brethren, and an <a href="../ebd/ebd017.htm#003">alien</a> unto my mother's children.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> For the <a href="../ebd/ebd388.htm#003">zeal</a> of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> I made <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#001">sackcloth</a> also my garment; and I became a <a href="../ebd/ebd301.htm#002">proverb</a> to them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> They that sit in the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> speak against me; and I was the song of the drunkards.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> But as for me, my <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a> is unto thee, O LORD, in an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> hear me, in the truth of thy <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</a> waters.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the <a href="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#009">swallow</a> me up, and let not the <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a> shut her mouth upon me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness is good: turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me speedily.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: deliver me because of mine enemies.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries are all before thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> They gave me also <a href="../ebd/ebd142.htm#000">gall</a> for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#006">vinegar</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Let their table become a <a href="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</a> before them: and that which should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> take hold of them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Let their <a href="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</a> be desolate; and let none dwell in their tents.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> But I am <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> and sorrowful: let thy <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a>, O God, set me up on high.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> This also shall please the LORD better than an <a href="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</a> or <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#003">bullock</a> that hath horns and hoofs.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> The humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shall live that seek God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> For the LORD heareth the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>, and despiseth not his prisoners.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> Let the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> For God will save <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a>, and will build the cities of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>: that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his name shall dwell therein.<br>
