 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 13</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And it came to pass after this, that <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> had a fair sister, whose name was <a href="../ebd/ebd358.htm#003">Tamar</a>; and <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#004">Amnon</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> loved her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#004">Amnon</a> was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister <a href="../ebd/ebd358.htm#003">Tamar</a>; for she was a <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#009">virgin</a>; and <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#004">Amnon</a> thought it hard for him to do anything to her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#004">Amnon</a> had a friend, whose name was <a href="../ebd/ebd210.htm#006">Jonadab</a>, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd338.htm#001">Shimeah</a> David's brother: and <a href="../ebd/ebd210.htm#006">Jonadab</a> was a very subtil man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the king's son, lean from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#004">Amnon</a> said unto him, I love <a href="../ebd/ebd358.htm#003">Tamar</a>, my brother Absalom's sister.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd210.htm#006">Jonadab</a> said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let my sister <a href="../ebd/ebd358.htm#003">Tamar</a> come, and give me meat, and <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#008">dress</a> the meat in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#004">Amnon</a> lay down, and made himself sick: and when the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> was come to see him, <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#004">Amnon</a> said unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, I pray thee, let <a href="../ebd/ebd358.htm#003">Tamar</a> my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> sent home to <a href="../ebd/ebd358.htm#003">Tamar</a>, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon's house, and <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#008">dress</a> him meat.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd358.htm#003">Tamar</a> went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down. And she took <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#001">flour</a>, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#001">bake</a> the cakes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And she took a <a href="../ebd/ebd283.htm#009">pan</a>, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#004">Amnon</a> said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#004">Amnon</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd358.htm#003">Tamar</a>, Bring the meat into the <a href="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</a>, that I may eat of thine hand. And <a href="../ebd/ebd358.htm#003">Tamar</a> took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the <a href="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#004">Amnon</a> her brother.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: do not thou this folly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the fools in <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>; for he will not withhold me from thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#004">Amnon</a> hated her exceedingly; so that the <a href="../ebd/ebd167.htm#002">hatred</a> wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#004">Amnon</a> said unto her, Arise, be gone.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And she said unto him, There is no cause: this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But he would not hearken unto her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd358.htm#003">Tamar</a> put <a href="../ebd/ebd034.htm#000">ashes</a> on her head, and <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</a> her garment of divers colours that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> her brother said unto her, Hath <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#004">Amnon</a> thy brother been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother; regard not this thing. So <a href="../ebd/ebd358.htm#003">Tamar</a> remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> But when <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> heard of all these things, he was very wroth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> spake unto his brother <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#004">Amnon</a> neither good nor bad: for <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> hated <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#004">Amnon</a>, because he had forced his sister <a href="../ebd/ebd358.htm#003">Tamar</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And it came to pass after two full years, that <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> had sheepshearers in Baalhazor, which is beside <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> invited all the king's sons.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> came to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath sheepshearers; let the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, I beseech thee, and his servants go with thy servant.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said to <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a>, Nay, my son, let us not all now go, lest we be chargeable unto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he would not go, but blessed him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a>, If not, I pray thee, let my brother <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#004">Amnon</a> go with us. And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said unto him, Why should he go with thee?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> pressed him, that he let <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#004">Amnon</a> and all the king's sons go with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Now <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon's heart is merry with <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>, and when I say unto you, Smite <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#004">Amnon</a>; then kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And the servants of <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> did unto <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#004">Amnon</a> as <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his <a href="../ebd/ebd262.htm#001">mule</a>, and fled.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came to <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, saying, <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> hath slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Then the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd210.htm#006">Jonadab</a>, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd338.htm#001">Shimeah</a> David's brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the king's sons; for <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#004">Amnon</a> only is dead: for by the appointment of <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister <a href="../ebd/ebd358.htm#003">Tamar</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Now therefore let not my lord the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead: for <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#004">Amnon</a> only is dead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd210.htm#006">Jonadab</a> said unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, Behold, the king's sons come: as thy servant said, so it is.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> also and all his servants wept very sore.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> fled, and went to <a href="../ebd/ebd358.htm#001">Talmai</a>, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd020.htm#007">Ammihud</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#001">Geshur</a>. And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> mourned for his son every day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> fled, and went to <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#001">Geshur</a>, and was there three years.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> And the soul of <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> longed to go forth unto <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a>: for he was comforted concerning <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#004">Amnon</a>, seeing he was dead.<br>
