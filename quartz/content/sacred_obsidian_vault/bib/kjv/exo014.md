 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Exodus Chapter 14</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And the LORD spake unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Speak unto the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, that they turn and <a href="../ebd/ebd120.htm#003">encamp</a> before Pihahiroth, between <a href="../ebd/ebd254.htm#003">Migdol</a> and the sea, over against Baalzephon: before it shall ye <a href="../ebd/ebd120.htm#003">encamp</a> by the sea.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> For <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> will say of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, They are entangled in the land, the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> hath shut them in.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after them; and I will be honoured upon <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, and upon all his <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a>; that the Egyptians may know that I am the LORD. And they did so.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And it was told the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> that the people fled: and the heart of <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> go from serving us?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And he made ready his <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</a>, and took his people with him:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And he took six hundred <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> chariots, and all the chariots of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and captains over every one of them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And the LORD hardened the heart of <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and he pursued after the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: and the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> went out with an high hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> drew nigh, the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> cried out unto the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And they said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, Because there were no graves in <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, hast thou taken us away to die in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Is not this the word that we did tell thee in <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a> of the LORD, which he will shew to you to day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, that they go forward:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, and upon all his <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a>, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have gotten me honour upon <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of God, which went before the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, removed and went behind them; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#007">pillar</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a> went from before their face, and stood behind them:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And it came between the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a> of the Egyptians and the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; and it was a <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a> to them, but it gave light by night to these: so that the one came not near the other all the night.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused the sea to go back by a strong <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a> wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> of the Egyptians through the <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#007">pillar</a> of fire and of the <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a>, and troubled the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> of the Egyptians,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And took off their <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</a> wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; for the LORD fighteth for them against the Egyptians.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, Stretch out thine hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and all the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> But the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Thus the LORD saved <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> saw that great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and his servant <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>.<br>
