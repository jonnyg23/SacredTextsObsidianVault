 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Acts Chapter 10</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> There was a certain man in <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#003">Caesarea</a> called <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#007">Cornelius</a>, a <a href="../ebd/ebd075.htm#004">centurion</a> of the band called the Italian band,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> A devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#002">alms</a> to the people, and prayed to God alway.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> He saw in a <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a> evidently about the ninth hour of the day an <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#007">Cornelius</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord?  And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#002">alms</a> are come up for a memorial before God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And now send men to <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#002">Joppa</a>, and call for one <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a>, whose surname is <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> He lodgeth with one <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a> a tanner, whose house is by the sea side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And when the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> which spake unto <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#007">Cornelius</a> was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#002">Joppa</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> On the morrow, as they went on their <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</a>, and drew nigh unto the city, <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a <a href="../ebd/ebd371.htm#006">trance</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And saw <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> opened, and a certain vessel descending upon him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And there came a voice to him, Rise, <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a>; kill, and eat.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Now while <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> doubted in himself what this <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a> which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#007">Cornelius</a> had made enquiry for Simon's house, and stood before the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And called, and asked whether <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a>, which was surnamed <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a>, were lodged there.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> While <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> thought on the <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> went down to the men which were sent unto him from <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#007">Cornelius</a>; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And they said, <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#007">Cornelius</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd075.htm#004">centurion</a>, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Then called he them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> went away with them, and certain brethren from <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#002">Joppa</a> accompanied him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And the morrow after they entered into <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#003">Caesarea</a>. And <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#007">Cornelius</a> waited for them, and he had called together his kinsmen and near friends.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And as <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> was coming in, <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#007">Cornelius</a> met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#004">Jew</a> to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#007">Cornelius</a> said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And said, <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#007">Cornelius</a>, thy <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a> is heard, and thine <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#002">alms</a> are had in remembrance in the sight of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> Send therefore to <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#002">Joppa</a>, and call hither <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a>, whose surname is <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a>; he is lodged in the house of one <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a> a tanner by the sea side: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>, is accepted with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> The word which God sent unto the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, preaching peace by <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>: (he is Lord of all:)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> That word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a>, after the baptism which John preached;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> How God anointed <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#007">Nazareth</a> with the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a> and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</a>; for God was with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> Not to all the people, but unto witnesses <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> before God, even to us, who did eat and <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> with him after he rose from the dead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">Judge</a> of quick and dead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> To him give all the prophets <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a>, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> While <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> yet spake these words, the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a> fell on all them which heard the word.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> And they of the <a href="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</a> which believed were astonished, as many as came with <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a>, because that on the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a> also was poured out the <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</a> of the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="046">46</a> For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="047">47</a> Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a> as well as we?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="048">48</a> And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.<br>
