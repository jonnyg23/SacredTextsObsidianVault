 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Hebrews Chapter 6</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, let us go on unto <a href="../ebd/ebd290.htm#001">perfection</a>; not laying again the foundation of <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#008">repentance</a> from dead works, and of faith toward God,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And this will we do, if God permit.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</a>, and were made partakers of the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#008">repentance</a>; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> For the earth which drinketh in the <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a> that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> But that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be burned.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a>, though we thus speak.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#004">assurance</a> of hope unto the end:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> For when God made promise to <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Saying, Surely blessing I will <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a> thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> For men verily swear by the greater: and an <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</a> for confirmation is to them an end of all strife.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Which hope we have as an <a href="../ebd/ebd023.htm#005">anchor</a> of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#001">veil</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Whither the <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#005">forerunner</a> is for us entered, even <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, made an high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> for ever after the order of Melchisedec.<br>
