 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Corinthians Chapter 11</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly: and indeed bear with me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> For I am jealous over you with godly <a href="../ebd/ebd198.htm#008">jealousy</a>: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#009">virgin</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> But I fear, lest by any means, as the <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#009">serpent</a> beguiled <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#005">Eve</a> through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> For if he that cometh preacheth another <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>, which ye have not received, or another <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a>, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> But though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a> of God freely?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> I robbed other churches, taking <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#004">wages</a> of them, to do you service.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from <a href="../ebd/ebd235.htm#003">Macedonia</a> supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will I keep myself.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> As the truth of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of <a href="../ebd/ebd006.htm#004">Achaia</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>, they may be found even as we.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And no marvel; for <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</a> himself is transformed into an <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of light.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>; whose end shall be according to their works.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Seeing that many <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> after the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, I will <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> also.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> For ye suffer, if a man bring you into <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#002">bondage</a>, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Are they <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#001">Hebrews</a>? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>? so am I.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Are they ministers of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in labours more abundant, in <a href="../ebd/ebd352.htm#005">stripes</a> above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Of the Jews five times received I forty <a href="../ebd/ebd352.htm#005">stripes</a> save one.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the <a href="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a>, in perils in the city, in perils in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> In weariness and painfulness, in <a href="../ebd/ebd379.htm#004">watchings</a> often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> If I must needs <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>, I will <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of the things which concern mine infirmities.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> The God and Father of our Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> In <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</a> the governor under <a href="../ebd/ebd030.htm#002">Aretas</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> kept the city of the Damascenes with a <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#007">garrison</a>, desirous to apprehend me:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And through a window in a <a href="../ebd/ebd046.htm#009">basket</a> was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands.<br>
