 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Zephaniah Chapter 2</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together, O nation not desired;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Before the decree bring forth, before the day pass as the <a href="../ebd/ebd075.htm#007">chaff</a>, before the fierce <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> of the LORD come upon you, before the day of the LORD's <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> come upon you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Seek ye the LORD, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment; seek <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>, seek <a href="../ebd/ebd246.htm#003">meekness</a>: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the LORD's <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> For <a href="../ebd/ebd144.htm#003">Gaza</a> shall be forsaken, and <a href="../ebd/ebd034.htm#001">Ashkelon</a> a desolation: they shall drive out <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#006">Ashdod</a> at the noon day, and <a href="../ebd/ebd114.htm#001">Ekron</a> shall be rooted up.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation of the Cherethites! the word of the LORD is against you; O <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</a>, the land of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>, I will even destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And the sea coast shall be <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#001">dwellings</a> and cottages for shepherds, and folds for flocks.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>; they shall feed thereupon: in the houses of <a href="../ebd/ebd034.htm#001">Ashkelon</a> shall they lie down in the evening: for the LORD their God shall visit them, and turn away their <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> I have heard the reproach of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>, and the revilings of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a>, whereby they have reproached my people, and magnified themselves against their border.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Therefore as I live, saith the LORD of hosts, the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, Surely <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a> shall be as <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#004">Sodom</a>, and the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a> as <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#007">Gomorrah</a>, even the breeding of nettles, and saltpits, and a perpetual desolation: the residue of my people shall spoil them, and the remnant of my people shall possess them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> This shall they have for their pride, because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of the LORD of hosts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> The LORD will be terrible unto them: for he will famish all the gods of the earth; and men shall <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> him, every one from his place, even all the isles of the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Ye Ethiopians also, ye shall be slain by my <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and destroy <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</a>; and will make <a href="../ebd/ebd273.htm#006">Nineveh</a> a desolation, and dry like a <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of the nations: both the <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#005">cormorant</a> and the <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#000">bittern</a> shall <a href="../ebd/ebd231.htm#002">lodge</a> in the upper lintels of it; their voice shall sing in the windows; desolation shall be in the thresholds; for he shall uncover the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</a> work.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> This is the rejoicing city that dwelt carelessly, that said in her heart, I am, and there is none beside me: how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every one that passeth by her shall <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#005">hiss</a>, and wag his hand.<br>
