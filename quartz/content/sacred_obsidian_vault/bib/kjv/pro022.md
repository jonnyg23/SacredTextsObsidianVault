 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 22</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> A GOOD name is rather to be <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> than great riches, and loving favour rather than <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> The rich and <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> meet together: the LORD is the maker of them all.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself: but the simple pass on, and are punished.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> By <a href="../ebd/ebd184.htm#007">humility</a> and the fear of the LORD are riches, and honour, and life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Thorns and snares are in the way of the froward: he that doth keep his soul shall be far from them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> The rich ruleth over the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>, and the borrower is servant to the lender.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> He that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity: and the rod of his <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> shall fail.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed; for he giveth of his <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> to the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Cast out the scorner, and contention shall go out; yea, strife and reproach shall cease.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> He that loveth pureness of heart, for the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> of his lips the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> shall be his friend.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> The eyes of the LORD preserve knowledge, and he overthroweth the words of the transgressor.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> The slothful man saith, There is a lion without, I shall be slain in the streets.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> The mouth of strange women is a <a href="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a>: he that is abhorred of the LORD shall fall therein.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child; but the rod of correction shall drive it far from him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> He that oppresseth the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> to increase his riches, and he that giveth to the rich, shall surely come to want.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">Bow</a> down thine <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a>, and hear the words of the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a>, and apply thine heart unto my knowledge.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> For it is a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee; they shall withal be fitted in thy lips.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> That thy trust may be in the LORD, I have made known to thee this day, even to thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Have not I written to thee excellent things in counsels and knowledge,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> That I might make thee know the certainty of the words of truth; that thou mightest answer the words of truth to them that send unto thee?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Rob not the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>, because he is <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>: neither oppress the afflicted in the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> For the LORD will plead their cause, and spoil the soul of those that spoiled them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Make no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man thou shalt not go:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Lest thou learn his ways, and get a <a href="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</a> to thy soul.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Be not thou one of them that strike hands, or of them that are sureties for debts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> If thou hast nothing to pay, why should he take away thy bed from under thee?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Remove not the ancient <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#008">landmark</a>, which thy fathers have set.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean men.<br>
