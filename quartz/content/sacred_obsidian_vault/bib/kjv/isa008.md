 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 8</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Moreover the LORD said unto me, Take thee a great <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#004">roll</a>, and write in it with a man's pen concerning Mahershalalhashbaz.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And I took unto me <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a> witnesses to record, <a href="../ebd/ebd375.htm#002">Uriah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#006">Zechariah</a> the son of Jeberechiah.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a son. Then said the LORD to me, Call his name Mahershalalhashbaz.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and my mother, the riches of <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</a> and the spoil of <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a> shall be taken away before the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> The LORD spake also unto me again, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in <a href="../ebd/ebd312.htm#006">Rezin</a> and Remaliah's son;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the river, strong and many, even the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</a>, and all his <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>: and he shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his banks:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And he shall pass through <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>; he shall overflow and go over, he shall reach even to the <a href="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</a>; and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O <a href="../ebd/ebd187.htm#007">Immanuel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a>; and give <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a>, all ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a>; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand: for God is with us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> For the LORD spake thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Say ye not, A confederacy, to all them to whom this people shall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Sanctify the LORD of hosts himself; and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And he shall be for a <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</a>; but for a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> of stumbling and for a <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a> of offence to both the houses of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, for a <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#004">gin</a> and for a <a href="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</a> to the inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Bind up the <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd325.htm#002">seal</a> the law among my disciples.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And I will wait upon the LORD, that hideth his face from the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, and I will look for him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Behold, I and the children whom the LORD hath given me are for signs and for wonders in <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> from the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth in <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people seek unto their God? for the living to the dead?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> To the law and to the <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</a>: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And they shall pass through it, hardly <a href="../ebd/ebd054.htm#001">bestead</a> and hungry: and it shall come to pass, that when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</a> their <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> and their God, and look upward.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And they shall look unto the earth; and behold trouble and <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>, dimness of anguish; and they shall be driven to <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>.<br>
