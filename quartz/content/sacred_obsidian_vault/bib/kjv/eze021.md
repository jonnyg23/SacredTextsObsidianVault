 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 21</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Son of man, set thy face toward <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and drop thy word toward the holy places, and prophesy against the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And say to the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I am against thee, and will draw forth my <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> out of his sheath, and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> go forth out of his sheath against all <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> from the south to the north:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> That all <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> may know that I the LORD have drawn forth my <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> out of his sheath: it shall not return any more.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Sigh therefore, thou son of man, with the breaking of thy loins; and with bitterness sigh before their eyes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou? that thou shalt answer, For the tidings; because it cometh: and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> shall faint, and all knees shall be weak as water: behold, it cometh, and shall be brought to pass, saith the Lord GOD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD; Say, A <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, a <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> is sharpened, and also furbished:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> It is sharpened to make a sore slaughter; it is furbished that it may glitter: should we then make mirth? it contemneth the rod of my son, as every tree.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And he hath given it to be furbished, that it may be handled: this <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> is sharpened, and it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the slayer.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Cry and howl, son of man: for it shall be upon my people, it shall be upon all the princes of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: terrors by reason of the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> shall be upon my people: smite therefore upon thy thigh.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Because it is a trial, and what if the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> contemn even the rod?  it shall be no more, saith the Lord GOD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite thine hands together. and let the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> be doubled the third time, the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> of the slain: it is the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> of the great men that are slain, which entereth into their privy chambers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> I have set the point of the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> against all their gates, that their heart may faint, and their ruins be multiplied: ah! it is made bright, it is wrapped up for the slaughter.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Go thee one way or other, either on the right hand, or on the left, whithersoever thy face is set.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> I will also smite mine hands together, and I will cause my <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</a> to rest: I the LORD have said it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Also, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> may come: both twain shall come forth out of one land: and choose thou a place, choose it at the head of the way to the city.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Appoint a way, that the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> may come to Rabbath of the Ammonites, and to <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> the defenced.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> For the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use <a href="../ebd/ebd104.htm#009">divination</a>: he made his <a href="../ebd/ebd032.htm#005">arrows</a> bright, he consulted with images, he looked in the <a href="../ebd/ebd230.htm#004">liver</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> At his right hand was the <a href="../ebd/ebd104.htm#009">divination</a> for <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, to appoint captains, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to appoint battering rams against the gates, to cast a <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a>, and to build a fort.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And it shall be unto them as a false <a href="../ebd/ebd104.htm#009">divination</a> in their sight, to them that have sworn oaths: but he will call to remembrance the iniquity, that they may be taken.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are discovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because, I say, that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And thou, profane wicked <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, whose day is come, when iniquity shall have an end,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Thus saith the Lord GOD; Remove the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#009">diadem</a>, and take off the <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</a>: this shall not be the same: exalt him that is low, and abase him that is high.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And thou, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites, and concerning their reproach; even say thou, The <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> is drawn: for the slaughter it is furbished, to consume because of the glittering:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Whiles they see vanity unto thee, whiles they divine a lie unto thee, to bring thee upon the necks of them that are slain, of the wicked, whose day is come, when their iniquity shall have an end.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Shall I cause it to return into his sheath? I will <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> thee in the place where thou wast created, in the land of thy nativity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee, I will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath, and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men, and skilful to destroy.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> Thou shalt be for <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#002">fuel</a> to the fire; thy <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> shall be in the midst of the land; thou shalt be no more remembered: for I the LORD have spoken it.<br>
