 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Acts Chapter 9</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And desired of him letters to <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</a> to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And as he journeyed, he came near <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</a>: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, why persecutest thou me?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him into <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And there was a certain <a href="../ebd/ebd104.htm#003">disciple</a> at <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</a>, named <a href="../ebd/ebd023.htm#001">Ananias</a>; and to him said the Lord in a <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd023.htm#001">Ananias</a>. And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and enquire in the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#001">Judas</a> for one called <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, of <a href="../ebd/ebd359.htm#003">Tarsus</a>: for, behold, he prayeth,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And hath seen in a <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a> a man named <a href="../ebd/ebd023.htm#001">Ananias</a> coming in, and putting his hand on him, that he might receive his sight.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd023.htm#001">Ananias</a> answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> vessel unto me, to bear my name before the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>, and kings, and the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> For I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd023.htm#001">Ananias</a> went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, the Lord, even <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And when he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then was <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> certain days with the disciples which were at <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And straightway he preached <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> But all that heard him were amazed, and said; Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</a>, proving that this is very <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> But their laying await was known of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>. And they watched the gates day and night to kill him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the wall in a <a href="../ebd/ebd046.htm#009">basket</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> was come to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, he assayed to join himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a <a href="../ebd/ebd104.htm#003">disciple</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</a> took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</a> in the name of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And he was with them coming in and going out at <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, and disputed against the <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#002">Grecians</a>: but they went about to slay him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Which when the brethren knew, they brought him down to <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#003">Caesarea</a>, and sent him forth to <a href="../ebd/ebd359.htm#003">Tarsus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a>, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a>, were multiplied.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And it came to pass, as <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> passed throughout all quarters, he came down also to the saints which dwelt at <a href="../ebd/ebd233.htm#009">Lydda</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, which had kept his bed eight years, and was sick of the <a href="../ebd/ebd283.htm#004">palsy</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> said unto him, Aeneas, <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> maketh thee whole: arise, and make thy bed. And he arose immediately.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And all that dwelt at <a href="../ebd/ebd233.htm#009">Lydda</a> and Saron saw him, and turned to the Lord.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> Now there was at <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#002">Joppa</a> a certain <a href="../ebd/ebd104.htm#003">disciple</a> named <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#005">Tabitha</a>, which by interpretation is called <a href="../ebd/ebd106.htm#004">Dorcas</a>: this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died: whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper <a href="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> And forasmuch as <a href="../ebd/ebd233.htm#009">Lydda</a> was nigh to <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#002">Joppa</a>, and the disciples had heard that <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring him that he would not delay to come to them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper <a href="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</a>: and all the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#003">widows</a> stood by him weeping, and shewing the coats and garments which <a href="../ebd/ebd106.htm#004">Dorcas</a> made, while she was with them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning him to the body said, <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#005">Tabitha</a>, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a>, she sat up.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the saints and <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#003">widows</a>, presented her alive.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> And it was known throughout all <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#002">Joppa</a>; and many believed in the Lord.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#002">Joppa</a> with one <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a> a tanner.<br>
