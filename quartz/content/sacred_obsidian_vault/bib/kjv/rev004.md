 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Revelation Chapter 4</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And immediately I was in the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>: and, behold, a <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> was set in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and one sat on the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And he that sat was to look upon like a <a href="../ebd/ebd198.htm#003">jasper</a> and a sardine <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a>: and there was a <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#009">rainbow</a> round about the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a>, in sight like unto an <a href="../ebd/ebd119.htm#007">emerald</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And round about the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> were four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders <a href="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</a>, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices: and there were <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> lamps of fire burning before the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a>, which are the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> Spirits of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And before the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> there was a sea of glass like unto <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#005">crystal</a>: and in the midst of the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a>, and round about the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a>, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And the first <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> was like a lion, and the second <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> like a <a href="../ebd/ebd069.htm#004">calf</a>, and the third <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> had a face as a man, and the fourth <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> was like a flying <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#003">eagle</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, LORD God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And when those beasts give <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> and honour and thanks to him that sat on the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a>, who liveth for ever and ever,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.<br>
