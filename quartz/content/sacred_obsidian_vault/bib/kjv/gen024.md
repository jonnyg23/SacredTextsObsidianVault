 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Genesis Chapter 24</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD had blessed <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> in all things.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#007">Canaanites</a>, among whom I dwell:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> The LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, which took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</a>: only bring not my son thither again.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And the servant put his hand under the thigh of <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> his master, and sware to him concerning that matter.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to <a href="../ebd/ebd251.htm#003">Mesopotamia</a>, unto the city of <a href="../ebd/ebd265.htm#006">Nahor</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to draw water.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And he said O LORD God of my master <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, I pray thee, send me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#009">pitcher</a>, I pray thee, that I may <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>; and she shall say, <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">Drink</a>, and I will give thy camels <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a>; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#001">Rebekah</a> came out, who was born to <a href="../ebd/ebd057.htm#003">Bethuel</a>, son of Milcah, the wife of <a href="../ebd/ebd265.htm#006">Nahor</a>, Abraham's brother, with her <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#009">pitcher</a> upon her shoulder.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#009">virgin</a>, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#009">pitcher</a>, and came up.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> a little water of thy <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#009">pitcher</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And she said, <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">Drink</a>, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#009">pitcher</a> upon her hand, and gave him <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And when she had done giving him <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>, she said, I will draw water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And she hasted, and emptied her <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#009">pitcher</a> into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the LORD had made his <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</a> prosperous or not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#009">shekel</a> weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room in thy father's house for us to <a href="../ebd/ebd231.htm#002">lodge</a> in?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And she said unto him, I am the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd057.htm#003">Bethuel</a> the son of Milcah, which she bare unto <a href="../ebd/ebd265.htm#006">Nahor</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> She said moreover unto him, We have both <a href="../ebd/ebd352.htm#000">straw</a> and provender enough, and room to <a href="../ebd/ebd231.htm#002">lodge</a> in.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, who hath not left destitute my master of his <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> and his truth: I being in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master's brethren.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother's house these things.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#001">Rebekah</a> had a brother, and his name was <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</a> ran out unto the man, unto the well.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#001">Rebekah</a> his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave <a href="../ebd/ebd352.htm#000">straw</a> and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men's feet that were with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> And he said, I am Abraham's servant.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</a> my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#007">Canaanites</a>, in whose land I dwell:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> Then shalt thou be clear from this my <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</a>, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not thee one, thou shalt be clear from my <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my master <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, if now thou do prosper my way which I go:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#009">virgin</a> cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#009">pitcher</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> And she say to me, Both <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the same be the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for my master's son.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#001">Rebekah</a> came forth with her <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#009">pitcher</a> on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>, I pray thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="046">46</a> And she made haste, and let down her <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#009">pitcher</a> from her shoulder, and said, <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">Drink</a>, and I will give thy camels <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> also: so I drank, and she made the camels <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> also.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="047">47</a> And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd057.htm#003">Bethuel</a>, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="048">48</a> And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, which had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="049">49</a> And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="050">50</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd057.htm#003">Bethuel</a> answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="051">51</a> Behold, <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#001">Rebekah</a> is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master's son's wife, as the LORD hath spoken.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="052">52</a> And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD, <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#005">bowing</a> himself to the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="053">53</a> And the servant brought forth jewels of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, and jewels of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, and raiment, and gave them to <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#001">Rebekah</a>: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="054">54</a> And they did eat and <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="055">55</a> And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="056">56</a> And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="057">57</a> And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her mouth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="058">58</a> And they called <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#001">Rebekah</a>, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="059">59</a> And they sent away <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#001">Rebekah</a> their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="060">60</a> And they blessed <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#001">Rebekah</a>, and said unto her, Thou art our sister, be thou the mother of <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</a> of millions, and let thy seed possess the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> of those which hate them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="061">61</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#001">Rebekah</a> arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#001">Rebekah</a>, and went his way.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="062">62</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a> came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt in the south country.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="063">63</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a> went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="064">64</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#001">Rebekah</a> lifted up her eyes, and when she saw <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a>, she lighted off the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#000">camel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="065">65</a> For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="066">66</a> And the servant told <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a> all things that he had done.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="067">67</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a> brought her into his mother Sarah's <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a>, and took <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#001">Rebekah</a>, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a> was comforted after his mother's death.<br>
