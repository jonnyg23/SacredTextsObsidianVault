 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 32</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Then was kindled the wrath of <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#008">Elihu</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd044.htm#003">Barachel</a> the Buzite, of the kindred of <a href="../ebd/ebd306.htm#003">Ram</a>: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Now <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#008">Elihu</a> had waited till Job had spoken, because they were <a href="../ebd/ebd114.htm#008">elder</a> than he.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> When <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#008">Elihu</a> saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#008">Elihu</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd044.htm#003">Barachel</a> the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> But there is a <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> in man: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#006">inspiration</a> of the Almighty giveth them understanding.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Great men are not always <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a>: neither do the aged understand judgment.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Behold, I waited for your words; I gave <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a> to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and answered no more;)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> For I am full of matter, the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> within me constraineth me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Behold, my <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</a> is as <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> which hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker would soon take me away.<br>
