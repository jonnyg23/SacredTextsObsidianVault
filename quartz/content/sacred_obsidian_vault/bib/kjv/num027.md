 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Numbers Chapter 27</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then came the daughters of <a href="../ebd/ebd390.htm#002">Zelophehad</a>, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd174.htm#006">Hepher</a>, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#009">Gilead</a>, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd235.htm#006">Machir</a>, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</a>, of the families of <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>: and these are the names of his daughters; <a href="../ebd/ebd238.htm#000">Mahlah</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd274.htm#002">Noah</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd180.htm#003">Hoglah</a>, and Milcah, and Tirzah.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And they stood before <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, and before <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#000">Eleazar</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, and before the princes and all the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a>, by the door of the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Our father died in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the LORD in the company of <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#003">Korah</a>; but died in his own <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>, and had no sons.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Why should the name of our father be done away from among his family, because he hath no son? Give unto us therefore a possession among the brethren of our father.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> brought their cause before the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And the LORD spake unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> The daughters of <a href="../ebd/ebd390.htm#002">Zelophehad</a> speak right: thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brethren; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And thou shalt speak unto the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, saying, If a man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And if he have no daughter, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his brethren.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And if he have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his father's brethren.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And if his father have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#006">kinsman</a> that is next to him of his family, and he shall possess it: and it shall be unto the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> a statute of judgment, as the LORD commanded <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, Get thee up into this <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#006">Abarim</a>, and see the land which I have given unto the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto thy people, as <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a> thy brother was gathered.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> For ye rebelled against my commandment in the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#000">desert</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#000">Zin</a>, in the strife of the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a>, to sanctify me at the water before their eyes: that is the water of <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#009">Meribah</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd215.htm#003">Kadesh</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#000">Zin</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> spake unto the LORD, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Let the LORD, the God of the spirits of all <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, set a man over the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Which may go out before them, and which may go in before them, and which may lead them out, and which may bring them in; that the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a> of the LORD be not as <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a> which have no <a href="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, Take thee <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd275.htm#006">Nun</a>, a man in whom is the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>, and lay thine hand upon him;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And set him before <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#000">Eleazar</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, and before all the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a>; and give him a charge in their sight.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And thou shalt put some of thine honour upon him, that all the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a> of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> may be obedient.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And he shall stand before <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#000">Eleazar</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, who shall ask counsel for him after the judgment of <a href="../ebd/ebd375.htm#005">Urim</a> before the LORD: at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he, and all the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> with him, even all the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> did as the LORD commanded him: and he took <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a>, and set him before <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#000">Eleazar</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, and before all the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And he laid his hands upon him, and gave him a charge, as the LORD commanded by the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>.<br>
