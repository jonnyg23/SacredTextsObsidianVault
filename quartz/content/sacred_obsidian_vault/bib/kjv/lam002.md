 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Lamentations Chapter 2</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> How hath the LORD covered the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a> with a <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a> in his <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>, and cast down from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> unto the earth the beauty of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and remembered not his <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#009">footstool</a> in the day of his <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> The LORD hath swallowed up all the habitations of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, and hath not pitied: he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>; he hath brought them down to the ground: he hath polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> He hath cut off in his fierce <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> all the <a href="../ebd/ebd182.htm#003">horn</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and he burned against <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> like a flaming fire, which devoureth round about.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> He hath bent his <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a> like an enemy: he stood with his right hand as an <a href="../ebd/ebd011.htm#001">adversary</a>, and slew all that were pleasant to the eye in the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a> of the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a>: he poured out his <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</a> like fire.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> The LORD was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, he hath swallowed up all her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong holds, and hath increased in the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> mourning and <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#005">lamentation</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And he hath violently taken away his <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a>, as if it were of a garden: he hath destroyed his places of the assembly: the LORD hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a>, and hath despised in the indignation of his <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> and the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> The LORD hath cast off his <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a>, he hath abhorred his <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</a>, he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; they have made a noise in the house of the LORD, as in the day of a solemn <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> The LORD hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a>: he hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying: therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament; they languished together.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars: her <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> and her princes are among the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>: the law is no more; her prophets also find no <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a> from the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> The elders of the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a> sit upon the ground, and keep silence: they have cast up <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a> upon their heads; they have girded themselves with <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#001">sackcloth</a>: the virgins of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> hang down their heads to the ground.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Mine eyes do fail with tears, my <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#004">bowels</a> are troubled, my <a href="../ebd/ebd230.htm#004">liver</a> is poured upon the earth, for the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a> of the daughter of my people; because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> They say to their mothers, Where is <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>? when they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city, when their soul was poured out into their mothers' <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#008">bosom</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> What thing shall I take to <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> for thee? what thing shall I liken to thee, O daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>? what shall I equal to thee, that I may comfort thee, O <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#009">virgin</a> daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a>? for thy <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#005">breach</a> is great like the sea: who can heal thee?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee: and they have not discovered thine iniquity, to turn away thy <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a>; but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> All that pass by clap their hands at thee; they <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#005">hiss</a> and wag their head at the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, saying, Is this the city that men call The <a href="../ebd/ebd290.htm#001">perfection</a> of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> All thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee: they <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#005">hiss</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#008">gnash</a> the teeth: they say, We have swallowed her up: certainly this is the day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> The LORD hath done that which he had devised; he hath fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old: he hath thrown down, and hath not pitied: and he hath caused thine enemy to rejoice over thee, he hath set up the <a href="../ebd/ebd182.htm#003">horn</a> of thine adversaries.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Their heart cried unto the LORD, O wall of the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a>, let tears run down like a river day and night: give thyself no rest; let not the <a href="../ebd/ebd027.htm#004">apple</a> of thine eye cease.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the <a href="../ebd/ebd379.htm#003">watches</a> pour out thine heart like water before the face of the LORD: lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children, that faint for hunger in the top of every street.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Behold, O LORD, and consider to whom thou hast done this. Shall the women eat their <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a>, and children of a span long? shall the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> and the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> be slain in the <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</a> of the Lord?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my virgins and my young men are fallen by the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>; thou hast slain them in the day of thine <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>; thou hast killed, and not pitied.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about, so that in the day of the LORD's <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> none escaped nor remained: those that I have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed.<br>
