 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Psalms Chapter 139</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> O lord, thou hast searched me, and known me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Whither shall I go from thy <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> If I ascend up into <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, thou art there: if I make my bed in <a href="../ebd/ebd173.htm#003">hell</a>, behold, thou art there.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> If I say, Surely the <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a> shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Yea, the <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a> hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a> and the light are both alike to thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> For thou hast possessed my <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#001">reins</a>: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take thy name in vain.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> I hate them with perfect <a href="../ebd/ebd167.htm#002">hatred</a>: I count them mine enemies.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a>.<br>
