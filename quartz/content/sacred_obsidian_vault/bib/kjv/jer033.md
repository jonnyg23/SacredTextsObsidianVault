 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 33</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Moreover the word of the LORD came unto <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> the second time, while he was yet shut up in the court of the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Thus saith the LORD the maker thereof, the LORD that formed it, to establish it; the LORD is his name;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and shew thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> For thus saith the LORD, the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, which are thrown down by the mounts, and by the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> They come to fight with the Chaldeans, but it is to fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in mine <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> and in my <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</a>, and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And I will cause the <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> and the <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> to return, and will build them, as at the first.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me; and I will <a href="../ebd/ebd285.htm#001">pardon</a> all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned, and whereby they have transgressed against me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honour before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do unto them: and they shall fear and tremble for all the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</a> and for all the prosperity that I procure unto it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Thus saith the LORD; Again there shall be heard in this place, which ye say shall be desolate without man and without <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>, even in the cities of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and in the streets of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, that are desolate, without man, and without inhabitant, and without <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#001">bride</a>, the voice of them that shall say, Praise the LORD of hosts: for the LORD is good; for his <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> endureth for ever: and of them that shall bring the <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> of praise into the house of the LORD. For I will cause to return the <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a> of the land, as at the first, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Again in this place, which is desolate without man and without <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>, and in all the cities thereof, shall be an <a href="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</a> of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the vale, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a>, and in the places about <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and in the cities of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that telleth them, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will perform that good thing which I have promised unto the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> and to the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> In those days, and at that time, will I cause the <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#002">Branch</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> to grow up unto <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>; and he shall execute judgment and <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> in the land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> In those days shall <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> be saved, and <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> shall dwell safely: and this is the name wherewith she shall be called, The LORD our <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> For thus saith the LORD; <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> shall never want a man to sit upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> of the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings, and to kindle meat offerings, and to do <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> continually.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And the word of the LORD came unto <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Thus saith the LORD; If ye can break my <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> of the day, and my <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> of the night, and that there should not be day and night in their season;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Then may also my <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> be broken with <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> my servant, that he should not have a son to reign upon his <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a>; and with the Levites the priests, my ministers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> As the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured: so will I multiply the seed of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> my servant, and the Levites that <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</a> unto me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Moreover the word of the LORD came to <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Considerest thou not what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which the LORD hath <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a>, he hath even cast them off? thus they have despised my people, that they should be no more a nation before them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Thus saith the LORD; If my <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> be not with day and night, and if I have not appointed the ordinances of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> and earth;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Then will I cast away the seed of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> my servant, so that I will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>: for I will cause their <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a> to return, and have <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> on them.<br>
