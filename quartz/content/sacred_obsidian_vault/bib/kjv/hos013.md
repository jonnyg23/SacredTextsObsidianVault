 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Hosea Chapter 13</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> When <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a> spake trembling, he exalted himself in <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; but when he offended in <a href="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</a>, he died.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And now they <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> more and more, and have made them molten images of their <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, and idols according to their own understanding, all of it the work of the craftsmen: they say of them, Let the men that <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd221.htm#000">kiss</a> the calves.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Therefore they shall be as the morning <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a> and as the early <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#008">dew</a> that passeth away, as the <a href="../ebd/ebd075.htm#007">chaff</a> that is driven with the whirlwind out of the floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Yet I am the LORD thy God from the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and thou shalt know no god but me: for there is no <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#003">saviour</a> beside me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> I did know thee in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, in the land of great <a href="../ebd/ebd108.htm#005">drought</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> According to their pasture, so were they filled; they were filled, and their heart was exalted; therefore have they forgotten me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Therefore I will be unto them as a lion: as a <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#002">leopard</a> by the way will I observe them:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps, and will rend the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#003">caul</a> of their heart, and there will I devour them like a lion: the wild <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> shall tear them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> O <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, thou hast destroyed thyself; but in me is thine help.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> I will be thy <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>: where is any other that may save thee in all thy cities? and thy judges of whom thou saidst, Give me a <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> and princes?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> I gave thee a <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> in mine <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>, and took him away in my wrath.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> The iniquity of <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a> is bound up; his <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> is hid.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him: he is an unwise son; for he should not stay long in the place of the breaking forth of children.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> I will <a href="../ebd/ebd307.htm#005">ransom</a> them from the power of the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</a>; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</a>, I will be thy <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a>: <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#008">repentance</a> shall be hid from mine eyes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Though he be fruitful among his brethren, an <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a> wind shall come, the wind of the LORD shall come up from the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, and his spring shall become dry, and his <a href="../ebd/ebd138.htm#000">fountain</a> shall be dried up: he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a> shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>: their infants shall be dashed in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a>, and their women with child shall be ripped up.<br>
