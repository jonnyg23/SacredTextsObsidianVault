 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 19</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Better is the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> that walketh in his integrity, than he that is perverse in his lips, and is a fool.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Also, that the soul be without knowledge, it is not good; and he that hasteth with his feet sinneth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his heart fretteth against the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Wealth maketh many friends; but the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> is separated from his neighbour.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> A false <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall not escape.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Many will intreat the favour of the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</a>: and every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> All the brethren of the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him? he pursueth them with words, yet they are wanting to him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth understanding shall find good.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> A false <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall perish.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule over princes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> The discretion of a man deferreth his <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>; and it is his <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> to pass over a transgression.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> The king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion; but his favour is as <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#008">dew</a> upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> A foolish son is the calamity of his father: and the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> House and riches are the inheritance of fathers: and a prudent wife is from the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Slothfulness casteth into a <a href="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</a> sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; but he that despiseth his ways shall die.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> He that hath pity upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> lendeth unto the LORD; and that which he hath given will he pay him again.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> A man of great wrath shall suffer <a href="../ebd/ebd302.htm#005">punishment</a>: for if thou deliver him, yet thou must do it again.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> in thy latter end.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> There are many devices in a man's heart; nevertheless the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> The desire of a man is his kindness: and a <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> man is better than a liar.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> The fear of the LORD tendeth to life: and he that hath it shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> A slothful man hideth his hand in his <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#008">bosom</a>, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one that hath understanding, and he will understand knowledge.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> He that wasteth his father, and chaseth away his mother, is a son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Cease, my son, to hear the instruction that causeth to err from the words of knowledge.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> An ungodly <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Judgments are prepared for scorners, and <a href="../ebd/ebd352.htm#005">stripes</a> for the back of fools.<br>
