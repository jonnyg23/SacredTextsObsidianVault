 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 23</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then Job answered and said,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Even to day is my complaint <a href="../ebd/ebd059.htm#009">bitter</a>: my stroke is heavier than my groaning.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even to his seat!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would put strength in me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul desireth, even that he doeth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many such things are with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Because I was not cut off before the <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>, neither hath he covered the <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a> from my face.<br>
