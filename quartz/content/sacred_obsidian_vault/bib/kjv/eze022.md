 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 22</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Now, thou son of man, wilt thou <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a>, wilt thou <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> the bloody city? yea, thou shalt shew her all her abominations.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Then say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD, The city sheddeth <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> in the midst of it, that her time may come, and maketh idols against herself to defile herself.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Thou art become guilty in thy <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> that thou hast shed; and hast defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made; and thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come even unto thy years: therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a>, and a mocking to all countries.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Those that be near, and those that be far from thee, shall mock thee, which art infamous and much vexed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Behold, the princes of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, every one were in thee to their power to shed <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> In thee have they set light by father and mother: in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a>: in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Thou hast despised mine holy things, and hast profaned my sabbaths.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> In thee are men that carry tales to shed <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>: and in thee they eat upon the mountains: in the midst of thee they commit <a href="../ebd/ebd228.htm#002">lewdness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> In thee have they discovered their fathers' nakedness: in thee have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And one hath committed <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</a> with his neighbour's wife; and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law; and another in thee hath humbled his sister, his father's daughter.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> In thee have they taken gifts to shed <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>; thou hast taken <a href="../ebd/ebd375.htm#006">usury</a> and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord GOD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Behold, therefore I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made, and at thy <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> which hath been in the midst of thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with thee? I the LORD have spoken it, and will do it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And I will scatter thee among the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a>, and disperse thee in the countries, and will consume thy filthiness out of thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a>, and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Son of man, the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> is to me become <a href="../ebd/ebd108.htm#004">dross</a>: all they are <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd367.htm#005">tin</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a>, and lead, in the midst of the <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#000">furnace</a>; they are even the <a href="../ebd/ebd108.htm#004">dross</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye are all become <a href="../ebd/ebd108.htm#004">dross</a>, behold, therefore I will gather you into the midst of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> As they gather <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a>, and lead, and <a href="../ebd/ebd367.htm#005">tin</a>, into the midst of the <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#000">furnace</a>, to blow the fire upon it, to melt it; so will I gather you in mine <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> and in my <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</a>, and I will leave you there, and melt you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst therof.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> As <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> is melted in the midst of the <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#000">furnace</a>, so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I the LORD have poured out my <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</a> upon you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Son of man, say unto her, Thou art the land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they have made her many <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#003">widows</a> in the midst thereof.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they shewed difference between the unclean and the <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</a>, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>, and to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And her prophets have daubed them with untempered morter, seeing vanity, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord GOD, when the LORD hath not spoken.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#000">robbery</a>, and have vexed the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> and needy: yea, they have oppressed the <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a> wrongfully.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#000">gap</a> before me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I recompensed upon their heads, saith the Lord GOD.<br>
