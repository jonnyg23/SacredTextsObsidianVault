 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 51</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Hearken to me, ye that follow after <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>, ye that seek the LORD: look unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a> whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of the <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a> whence ye are digged.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Look unto <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> your father, and unto <a href="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</a> that bare you: for I called him alone, and blessed him, and increased him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> For the LORD shall comfort <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a>: he will comfort all her waste places; and he will make her <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> like <a href="../ebd/ebd112.htm#009">Eden</a>, and her <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#000">desert</a> like the garden of the LORD; joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Hearken unto me, my people; and give <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a> unto me, O my nation: for a law shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to rest for a light of the people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> My <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> is near; my <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a> is gone forth, and mine arms shall <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> the people; the isles shall wait upon me, and on mine arm shall they trust.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall <a href="../ebd/ebd380.htm#000">wax</a> old like a garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner: but my <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a> shall be for ever, and my <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> shall not be abolished.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Hearken unto me, ye that know <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>, the people in whose heart is my law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> For the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#005">moth</a> shall eat them up like a garment, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#000">worm</a> shall eat them like <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#005">wool</a>: but my <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> shall be for ever, and my <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a> from <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in the ancient days, in the generations of old. Art thou not it that hath cut <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#006">Rahab</a>, and wounded the <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#000">dragon</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Art thou not it which hath dried the sea, the waters of the great <a href="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</a>; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Therefore the redeemed of the LORD shall return, and come with singing unto <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a>; and <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> joy shall be upon their head: they shall obtain gladness and joy; and sorrow and mourning shall flee away.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> I, even I, am he that comforteth you: who art thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die, and of the son of man which shall be made as <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And forgettest the LORD thy maker, that hath stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and hast feared continually every day because of the <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</a> of the oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? and where is the <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</a> of the oppressor?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd128.htm#004">exile</a> hasteneth that he may be loosed, and that he should not die in the <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a>, nor that his <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> should fail.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> But I am the LORD thy God, that divided the sea, whose waves roared: The LORD of hosts is his name.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</a> of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a>, Thou art my people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Awake, awake, stand up, O <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, which hast <a href="../ebd/ebd108.htm#007">drunk</a> at the hand of the LORD the <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</a> of his <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</a>; thou hast drunken the <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#007">dregs</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</a> of trembling, and wrung them out.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> There is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath brought forth; neither is there any that taketh her by the hand of all the sons that she hath brought up.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> These two things are come unto thee; who shall be sorry for thee?  desolation, and <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>: by whom shall I comfort thee?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Thy sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as a wild bull in a <a href="../ebd/ebd271.htm#002">net</a>: they are full of the <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</a> of the LORD, the rebuke of thy God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not with <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Thus saith thy Lord the LORD, and thy God that pleadeth the cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of thine hand the <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</a> of trembling, even the <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#007">dregs</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</a> of my <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</a>; thou shalt no more <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> it again:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee; which have said to thy soul, <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">Bow</a> down, that we may go over: and thou hast laid thy body as the ground, and as the street, to them that went over.<br>
