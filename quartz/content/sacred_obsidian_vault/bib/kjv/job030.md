 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 30</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Yea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me, in whom old age was perished?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> For want and <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a> they were solitary; fleeing into the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> in former time desolate and waste.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Who cut up <a href="../ebd/ebd239.htm#005">mallows</a> by the bushes, and <a href="../ebd/ebd214.htm#005">juniper</a> roots for their meat.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them as after a thief;)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> To dwell in the cliffs of the valleys, in caves of the earth, and in the rocks.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> They were children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were viler than the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Because he hath loosed my <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#000">cord</a>, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#002">bridle</a> before me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the <a href="../ebd/ebd086.htm#004">collar</a> of my <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#004">coat</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd034.htm#000">ashes</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon it, and dissolvest my substance.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</a>, though they cry in his <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul grieved for the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> When I looked for good, then evil came unto me: and when I waited for light, there came <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> My <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#004">bowels</a> boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> I went mourning without the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a>: I stood up, and I cried in the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> My <a href="../ebd/ebd165.htm#001">harp</a> also is turned to mourning, and my <a href="../ebd/ebd280.htm#004">organ</a> into the voice of them that weep.<br>
