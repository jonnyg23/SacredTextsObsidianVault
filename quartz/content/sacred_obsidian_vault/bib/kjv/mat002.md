 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Matthew Chapter 2</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now when <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> was born in <a href="../ebd/ebd056.htm#005">Bethlehem</a> of Judaea in the days of Herod the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, behold, there came <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> men from the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Saying, Where is he that is born <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</a> of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a>, and are come to <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> When Herod the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> had heard these things, he was troubled, and all <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And when he had gathered all the chief priests and <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</a> of the people together, he demanded of them where <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> should be born.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And they said unto him, In <a href="../ebd/ebd056.htm#005">Bethlehem</a> of Judaea: for thus it is written by the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And thou <a href="../ebd/ebd056.htm#005">Bethlehem</a>, in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#006">Juda</a>, art not the least among the princes of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#006">Juda</a>: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Then Herod, when he had privily called the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And he sent them to <a href="../ebd/ebd056.htm#005">Bethlehem</a>, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> him also.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> When they had heard the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a>, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</a> his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd138.htm#004">frankincense</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd263.htm#003">myrrh</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And being warned of God in a <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a> that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And when they were departed, behold, the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the Lord appeareth to <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> in a <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a>, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>, saying, Out of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> have I called my son.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in <a href="../ebd/ebd056.htm#005">Bethlehem</a>, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> In <a href="../ebd/ebd306.htm#004">Rama</a> was there a voice heard, <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#005">lamentation</a>, and weeping, and great mourning, <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#004">Rachel</a> weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> But when Herod was dead, behold, an <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the Lord appeareth in a <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: for they are dead which sought the young child's life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> But when he heard that <a href="../ebd/ebd029.htm#001">Archelaus</a> did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a>, he turned aside into the parts of <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And he came and dwelt in a city called <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#007">Nazareth</a>: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#006">Nazarene</a>.<br>
