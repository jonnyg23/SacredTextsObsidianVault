 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Acts Chapter 16</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then came he to <a href="../ebd/ebd101.htm#009">Derbe</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd234.htm#003">Lystra</a>: and, behold, a certain <a href="../ebd/ebd104.htm#003">disciple</a> was there, named <a href="../ebd/ebd367.htm#001">Timotheus</a>, the son of a certain woman, which was a <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#005">Jewess</a>, and believed; but his father was a <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#004">Greek</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Which was well reported of by the brethren that were at <a href="../ebd/ebd234.htm#003">Lystra</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd186.htm#003">Iconium</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Him would <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#004">Greek</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Now when they had gone throughout <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#006">Phrygia</a> and the region of <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#004">Galatia</a>, and were forbidden of the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a> to preach the word in <a href="../ebd/ebd034.htm#008">Asia</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> After they were come to <a href="../ebd/ebd263.htm#005">Mysia</a>, they assayed to go into <a href="../ebd/ebd059.htm#008">Bithynia</a>: but the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> suffered them not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And they passing by <a href="../ebd/ebd263.htm#005">Mysia</a> came down to <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#008">Troas</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And a <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a> appeared to <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> in the night; There stood a man of <a href="../ebd/ebd235.htm#003">Macedonia</a>, and prayed him, saying, Come over into <a href="../ebd/ebd235.htm#003">Macedonia</a>, and help us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And after he had seen the <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a>, immediately we endeavoured to go into <a href="../ebd/ebd235.htm#003">Macedonia</a>, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a> unto them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Therefore loosing from <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#008">Troas</a>, we came with a straight course to <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#009">Samothracia</a>, and the next day to <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#000">Neapolis</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And from thence to <a href="../ebd/ebd293.htm#009">Philippi</a>, which is the chief city of that part of <a href="../ebd/ebd235.htm#003">Macedonia</a>, and a <a href="../ebd/ebd086.htm#007">colony</a>: and we were in that city abiding certain days.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And on the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> we went out of the city by a river side, where <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a> was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted thither.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And a certain woman named <a href="../ebd/ebd234.htm#000">Lydia</a>, a seller of purple, of the city of <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#004">Thyatira</a>, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a> to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there. And she constrained us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And it came to pass, as we went to <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a>, a certain damsel possessed with a <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd104.htm#009">divination</a> met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> The same followed <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And this did she many days. But <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a>, being grieved, turned and said to the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>, I command thee in the name of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> to come out of her. And he came out the same hour.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd343.htm#004">Silas</a>, and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</a> off their clothes, and commanded to beat them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And when they had laid many <a href="../ebd/ebd352.htm#005">stripes</a> upon them, they cast them into <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a>, charging the jailor to keep them safely:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a>, and made their feet <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a> in the stocks.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And at midnight <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd343.htm#004">Silas</a> prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And suddenly there was a great <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#009">earthquake</a>, so that the foundations of the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a> were shaken: and immediately all the <a href="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</a> were opened, and every one's <a href="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">bands</a> were loosed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And the keeper of the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a> awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</a> open, he drew out his <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd343.htm#004">Silas</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And they said, Believe on the Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their <a href="../ebd/ebd352.htm#005">stripes</a>; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> And the keeper of the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a> told this saying to <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a>, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a>; and now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> And they came and besought them, and brought them out, and desired them to depart out of the city.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> And they went out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a>, and entered into the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd234.htm#000">Lydia</a>: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.<br>
