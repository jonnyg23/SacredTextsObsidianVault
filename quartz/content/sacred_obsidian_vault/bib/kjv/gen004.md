 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Genesis Chapter 4</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd007.htm#007">Adam</a> knew <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#005">Eve</a> his wife; and she conceived, and bare <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#007">Cain</a>, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And she again bare his brother <a href="../ebd/ebd001.htm#004">Abel</a>. And <a href="../ebd/ebd001.htm#004">Abel</a> was a keeper of <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>, but <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#007">Cain</a> was a tiller of the ground.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And in process of time it came to pass, that <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#007">Cain</a> brought of the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> of the ground an <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> unto the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd001.htm#004">Abel</a>, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</a> thereof. And the LORD had respect unto <a href="../ebd/ebd001.htm#004">Abel</a> and to his <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> But unto <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#007">Cain</a> and to his <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> he had not respect. And <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#007">Cain</a> was very wroth, and his countenance fell.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#007">Cain</a>, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#007">Cain</a> talked with <a href="../ebd/ebd001.htm#004">Abel</a> his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#007">Cain</a> rose up against <a href="../ebd/ebd001.htm#004">Abel</a> his brother, and slew him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#007">Cain</a>, Where is <a href="../ebd/ebd001.htm#004">Abel</a> thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> crieth unto me from the ground.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> from thy hand;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#003">fugitive</a> and a <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#006">vagabond</a> shalt thou be in the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#007">Cain</a> said unto the LORD, My <a href="../ebd/ebd302.htm#005">punishment</a> is greater than I can bear.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#003">fugitive</a> and a <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#006">vagabond</a> in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#007">Cain</a>, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#007">Cain</a>, lest any finding him should kill him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#007">Cain</a> went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd274.htm#006">Nod</a>, on the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd112.htm#009">Eden</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#007">Cain</a> knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare <a href="../ebd/ebd121.htm#004">Enoch</a>: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, <a href="../ebd/ebd121.htm#004">Enoch</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And unto <a href="../ebd/ebd121.htm#004">Enoch</a> was born <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#001">Irad</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#001">Irad</a> begat <a href="../ebd/ebd246.htm#007">Mehujael</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd246.htm#007">Mehujael</a> begat <a href="../ebd/ebd251.htm#008">Methusael</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd251.htm#008">Methusael</a> begat <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#004">Lamech</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#004">Lamech</a> took unto him two wives: the name of the one was <a href="../ebd/ebd007.htm#006">Adah</a>, and the name of the other <a href="../ebd/ebd393.htm#004">Zillah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd007.htm#006">Adah</a> bare <a href="../ebd/ebd193.htm#005">Jabal</a>: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And his brother's name was <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#004">Jubal</a>: he was the father of all such as handle the <a href="../ebd/ebd165.htm#001">harp</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd280.htm#004">organ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd393.htm#004">Zillah</a>, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every <a href="../ebd/ebd032.htm#007">artificer</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a>: and the sister of Tubalcain was <a href="../ebd/ebd263.htm#008">Naamah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#004">Lamech</a> said unto his wives, <a href="../ebd/ebd007.htm#006">Adah</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd393.htm#004">Zillah</a>, Hear my voice; ye wives of <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#004">Lamech</a>, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> If <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#007">Cain</a> shall be avenged sevenfold, truly <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#004">Lamech</a> seventy and sevenfold.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd007.htm#007">Adam</a> knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#003">Seth</a>: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of <a href="../ebd/ebd001.htm#004">Abel</a>, whom <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#007">Cain</a> slew.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And to <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#003">Seth</a>, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name <a href="../ebd/ebd121.htm#005">Enos</a>: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.<br>
