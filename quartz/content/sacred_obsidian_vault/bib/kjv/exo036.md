 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Exodus Chapter 36</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then wrought <a href="../ebd/ebd057.htm#009">Bezaleel</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd015.htm#006">Aholiab</a>, and every <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> hearted man, in whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</a>, according to all that the LORD had commanded.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> called <a href="../ebd/ebd057.htm#009">Bezaleel</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd015.htm#006">Aholiab</a>, and every <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> hearted man, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And they received of <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> all the <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a>, which the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> had brought for the work of the service of the <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</a>, to make it withal. And they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And all the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> men, that wrought all the work of the <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</a>, came every man from his work which they made;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And they spake unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work, which the LORD commanded to make.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a>, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</a>. So the people were restrained from bringing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And every <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> hearted man among them that wrought the work of the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a> made ten curtains of fine twined <a href="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#003">blue</a>, and purple, and <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#005">scarlet</a>: with cherubims of cunning work made he them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> The length of one <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#004">curtain</a> was twenty and eight cubits, and the breadth of one <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#004">curtain</a> four cubits: the curtains were all of one size.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and the other five curtains he coupled one unto another.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And he made loops of <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#003">blue</a> on the edge of one <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#004">curtain</a> from the selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the uttermost side of another <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#004">curtain</a>, in the coupling of the second.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Fifty loops made he in one <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#004">curtain</a>, and fifty loops made he in the edge of the <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#004">curtain</a> which was in the coupling of the second: the loops held one <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#004">curtain</a> to another.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And he made fifty <a href="../ebd/ebd357.htm#001">taches</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, and coupled the curtains one unto another with the <a href="../ebd/ebd357.htm#001">taches</a>: so it became one <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And he made curtains of goats' hair for the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a> over the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a>: eleven curtains he made them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> The length of one <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#004">curtain</a> was thirty cubits, and four cubits was the breadth of one <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#004">curtain</a>: the eleven curtains were of one size.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#004">curtain</a> in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#004">curtain</a> which coupleth the second.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And he made fifty <a href="../ebd/ebd357.htm#001">taches</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a> to couple the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a> together, that it might be one.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And he made a covering for the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a> of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering of badgers' skins above that.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And he made boards for the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd339.htm#009">shittim</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a>, standing up.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> The length of a board was ten cubits, and the breadth of a board one <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#006">cubit</a> and a half.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another: thus did he make for all the boards of the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And he made boards for the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a>; twenty boards for the south side southward:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And forty sockets of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> he made under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two sockets under another board for his two tenons.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And for the other side of the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a>, which is toward the north corner, he made twenty boards,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And their forty sockets of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And for the sides of the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd380.htm#008">westward</a> he made six boards.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And two boards made he for the corners of the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a> in the two sides.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at the head thereof, to one <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#007">ring</a>: thus he did to both of them in both the corners.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And there were eight boards; and their sockets were sixteen sockets of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, under every board two sockets.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And he made bars of <a href="../ebd/ebd339.htm#009">shittim</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a>; five for the boards of the one side of the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And five bars for the boards of the other side of the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a>, and five bars for the boards of the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a> for the sides <a href="../ebd/ebd380.htm#008">westward</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from the one end to the other.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> And he overlaid the boards with <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, and made their rings of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> to be places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And he made a vail of <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#003">blue</a>, and purple, and <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#005">scarlet</a>, and fine twined <a href="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</a>: with cherubims made he it of cunning work.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> And he made thereunto four pillars of <a href="../ebd/ebd339.htm#009">shittim</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a>, and overlaid them with <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>: their hooks were of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>; and he cast for them four sockets of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>.<br>
 </p>
