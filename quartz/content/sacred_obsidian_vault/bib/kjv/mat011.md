 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Matthew Chapter 11</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And it came to pass, when <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Now when John had heard in the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a> the works of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, he sent two of his disciples,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answered and said unto them, Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and see:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a> receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> have the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a> preached to them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And as they departed, <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> to see? A <a href="../ebd/ebd309.htm#000">reed</a> shaken with the wind?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment?  behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings' houses.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> But what went ye out for to see? A <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>? yea, I say unto you, and more than a <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my <a href="../ebd/ebd251.htm#005">messenger</a> before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> is greater than he.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And if ye will receive it, this is <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#002">Elias</a>, which was for to come.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> But whereunto shall I liken this <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a>? It is like unto children <a href="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</a> in the markets, and <a href="../ebd/ebd069.htm#007">calling</a> unto their fellows,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> For John came neither <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#006">eating</a> nor drinking, and they say, He hath a <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> The Son of man came <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#006">eating</a> and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Woe unto thee, <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#007">Chorazin</a>! woe unto thee, <a href="../ebd/ebd056.htm#009">Bethsaida</a>! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in <a href="../ebd/ebd374.htm#001">Tyre</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd343.htm#000">Sidon</a>, they would have repented long ago in <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#001">sackcloth</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd034.htm#000">ashes</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for <a href="../ebd/ebd374.htm#001">Tyre</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd343.htm#000">Sidon</a> at the day of judgment, than for you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And thou, <a href="../ebd/ebd071.htm#007">Capernaum</a>, which art exalted unto <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, shalt be brought down to <a href="../ebd/ebd173.htm#003">hell</a>: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#004">Sodom</a>, it would have remained until this day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#004">Sodom</a> in the day of judgment, than for thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> At that time <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Take my <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</a> upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> For my <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</a> is easy, and my <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</a> is light.<br>
