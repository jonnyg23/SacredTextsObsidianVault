 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Genesis Chapter 41</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And, behold, there came up out of the river <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> well favoured <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#000">kine</a> and fatfleshed; and they fed in a <a href="../ebd/ebd245.htm#000">meadow</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And, behold, <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> other <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#000">kine</a> came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#000">kine</a> upon the brink of the river.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And the ill favoured and leanfleshed <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#000">kine</a> did eat up the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> well favoured and <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#000">kine</a>. So <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> awoke.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> ears of <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</a> came up upon one stalk, rank and good.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And, behold, <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> thin ears and blasted with the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a> wind sprung up after them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> thin ears devoured the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> rank and full ears. And <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> awoke, and, behold, it was a <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And it came to pass in the morning that his <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> was troubled; and he sent and called for all the <a href="../ebd/ebd236.htm#007">magicians</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and all the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> men thereof: and <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> told them his <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a>; but there was none that could interpret them unto <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Then spake the chief <a href="../ebd/ebd067.htm#001">butler</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, saying, I do remember my faults this day:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> was wroth with his servants, and put me in <a href="../ebd/ebd379.htm#001">ward</a> in the captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And we dreamed a <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a> in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And there was there with us a young man, an <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#009">Hebrew</a>, servant to the captain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</a>; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a> he did interpret.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> sent and called <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>, and they brought him hastily out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#006">dungeon</a>: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>, I have dreamed a <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a>, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou canst understand a <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a> to interpret it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> answered <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, saying, It is not in me: God shall give <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> an answer of peace.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>, In my <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a>, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And, behold, there came up out of the river <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#000">kine</a>, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a <a href="../ebd/ebd245.htm#000">meadow</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And, behold, <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> other <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#000">kine</a> came up after them, <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> for badness:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And the lean and the ill favoured <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#000">kine</a> did eat up the first <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#000">kine</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And I saw in my <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a>, and, behold, <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> ears came up in one stalk, full and good:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And, behold, <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a> wind, sprung up after them:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And the thin ears devoured the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> good ears: and I told this unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd236.htm#007">magicians</a>; but there was none that could declare it to me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, The <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> is one: God hath shewed <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> what he is about to do.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> good <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#000">kine</a> are <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> years; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> good ears are <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> years: the <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a> is one.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> thin and ill favoured <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#000">kine</a> that came up after them are <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> years; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> empty ears blasted with the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a> wind shall be <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> years of <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> This is the thing which I have spoken unto <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>: What God is about to do he sheweth unto <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Behold, there come <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> years of great plenty throughout all the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And there shall arise after them <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> years of <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a>; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a> shall consume the land;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a> following; for it shall be very grievous.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And for that the <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a> was doubled unto <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Now therefore let <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> look out a man discreet and <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a>, and set him over the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> Let <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> plenteous years.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</a> under the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, and let them keep food in the cities.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> And that food shall be for store to the land against the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> years of <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a>, which shall be in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>; that the land perish not through the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> And the thing was good in the eyes of <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, and in the eyes of all his servants.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> of God is?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none so discreet and <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> as thou art:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> will I be greater than thou.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>, See, I have set thee over all the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> took off his <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#007">ring</a> from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine <a href="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</a>, and put a <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd075.htm#008">chain</a> about his <a href="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> And he made him to ride in the second <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</a> which he had; and they cried before him, <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">Bow</a> the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>, I am <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to wife <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#004">Asenath</a> the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd299.htm#003">Potipherah</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> of On. And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> went out over all the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="046">46</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> was thirty years old when he stood before <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>. And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> went out from the presence of <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, and went throughout all the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="047">47</a> And in the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="048">48</a> And he gathered up all the food of the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> years, which were in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="049">49</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> gathered <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</a> as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for it was without number.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="050">50</a> And unto <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> were born two sons before the years of <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a> came, which <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#004">Asenath</a> the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd299.htm#003">Potipherah</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> of On bare unto him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="051">51</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> called the name of the firstborn <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</a>: For God, said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="052">52</a> And the name of the second called he <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a>: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="053">53</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> years of plenteousness, that was in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, were ended.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="054">54</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> years of <a href="../ebd/ebd099.htm#005">dearth</a> began to come, according as <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> had said: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd099.htm#005">dearth</a> was in all lands; but in all the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> there was <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="055">55</a> And when all the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> was famished, the people cried to <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> for <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>; what he saith to you, do.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="056">56</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a> was over all the face of the earth: and <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a> waxed sore in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="057">57</a> And all countries came into <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> for to buy <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</a>; because that the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a> was so sore in all lands.<br>
