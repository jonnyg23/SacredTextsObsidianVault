 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 3</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And Job spake, and said,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Let that day be <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Let <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a> and the <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</a> of death stain it; let a <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a> dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> As for that night, let <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a> seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Let them <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</a> it that <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</a> the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Let the <a href="../ebd/ebd350.htm#008">stars</a> of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Because it shut not up the <a href="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</a> of my mother's womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">ghost</a> when I came out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> With kings and counsellors of the earth, which build desolate places for themselves;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Or with princes that had <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, who filled their houses with <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Or as an hidden untimely <a href="../ebd/ebd059.htm#002">birth</a> I had not been; as infants which never saw light.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd059.htm#009">bitter</a> in soul;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.<br>
