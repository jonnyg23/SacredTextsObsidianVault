 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 15</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now in the eighteenth year of <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#003">Nebat</a> reigned <a href="../ebd/ebd003.htm#007">Abijam</a> over <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Three years reigned he in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>. and his mother's name was <a href="../ebd/ebd234.htm#004">Maachah</a>, the daughter of Abishalom.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as the heart of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> his father.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Nevertheless for David's sake did the LORD his God give him a <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#007">lamp</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, to set up his son after him, and to establish <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Because <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of <a href="../ebd/ebd375.htm#002">Uriah</a> the Hittite.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And there was war between <a href="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a> all the days of his life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Now the rest of the acts of <a href="../ebd/ebd003.htm#007">Abijam</a>, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#003">chronicles</a> of the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>? And there was war between <a href="../ebd/ebd003.htm#007">Abijam</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd003.htm#007">Abijam</a> slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a> his son reigned in his stead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And in the twentieth year of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> reigned <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a> over <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And forty and one years reigned he in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>. And his mother's name was <a href="../ebd/ebd234.htm#004">Maachah</a>, the daughter of Abishalom.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a> did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, as did <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> his father.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And he took away the <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#006">sodomites</a> out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And also <a href="../ebd/ebd234.htm#004">Maachah</a> his mother, even her he removed from being <a href="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</a>, because she had made an <a href="../ebd/ebd186.htm#006">idol</a> in a <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#008">grove</a>; and <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a> destroyed her <a href="../ebd/ebd186.htm#006">idol</a>, and burnt it by the <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#006">brook</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd218.htm#008">Kidron</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa's heart was perfect with the LORD all his days.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated, and the things which himself had dedicated, into the house of the LORD, <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, and vessels.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And there was war between <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd040.htm#008">Baasha</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> all their days.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd040.htm#008">Baasha</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> went up against <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and built <a href="../ebd/ebd306.htm#005">Ramah</a>, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a> took all the <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> and the <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> that were left in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants: and <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a> sent them to Benhadad, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd357.htm#000">Tabrimon</a>, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#004">Hezion</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</a>, that dwelt at <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> There is a <a href="../ebd/ebd225.htm#005">league</a> between me and thee, and between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>; come and break thy <a href="../ebd/ebd225.htm#005">league</a> with <a href="../ebd/ebd040.htm#008">Baasha</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, that he may depart from me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> So Benhadad hearkened unto <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a>, and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and smote <a href="../ebd/ebd187.htm#002">Ijon</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#009">Dan</a>, and Abelbethmaachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#006">Naphtali</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And it came to pass, when <a href="../ebd/ebd040.htm#008">Baasha</a> heard thereof, that he left off building of <a href="../ebd/ebd306.htm#005">Ramah</a>, and dwelt in Tirzah.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a> made a proclamation throughout all <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>; none was exempted: and they took away the stones of <a href="../ebd/ebd306.htm#005">Ramah</a>, and the timber thereof, wherewith <a href="../ebd/ebd040.htm#008">Baasha</a> had builded; and <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a> built with them <a href="../ebd/ebd144.htm#004">Geba</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#000">Mizpah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> The rest of all the acts of <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a>, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the book of the <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#003">chronicles</a> of the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>? Nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a> slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> his father: and <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a> his son reigned in his stead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd264.htm#008">Nadab</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a> began to reign over <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> in the second year of <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and reigned over <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> two years.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in his <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> wherewith he made <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd040.htm#008">Baasha</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd014.htm#000">Ahijah</a>, of the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#002">Issachar</a>, conspired against him; and <a href="../ebd/ebd040.htm#008">Baasha</a> smote him at <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#007">Gibbethon</a>, which belonged to the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>; for <a href="../ebd/ebd264.htm#008">Nadab</a> and all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> laid siege to <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#007">Gibbethon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Even in the third year of <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> did <a href="../ebd/ebd040.htm#008">Baasha</a> slay him, and reigned in his stead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a>; he left not to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a> any that breathed, until he had destroyed him, according unto the saying of the LORD, which he spake by his servant <a href="../ebd/ebd014.htm#000">Ahijah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd337.htm#009">Shilonite</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Because of the sins of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a> which he sinned, and which he made <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>, by his provocation wherewith he provoked the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Now the rest of the acts of <a href="../ebd/ebd264.htm#008">Nadab</a>, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#003">chronicles</a> of the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And there was war between <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd040.htm#008">Baasha</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> all their days.<br>
