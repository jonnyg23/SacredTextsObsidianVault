 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Hebrews Chapter 13</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Let brotherly love continue.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Be not forgetful to <a href="../ebd/ebd121.htm#009">entertain</a> strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Let your <a href="../ebd/ebd089.htm#001">conversation</a> be without <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#000">covetousness</a>; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their <a href="../ebd/ebd089.htm#001">conversation</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For it is a good thing that the heart be established with <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a>; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> We have an <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a>, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> For the bodies of those beasts, whose <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> is brought into the <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</a> by the high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> for <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>, are burned without the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Wherefore <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> also, that he might sanctify the people with his own <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>, suffered without the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Let us go forth therefore unto him without the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a>, bearing his reproach.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> By him therefore let us offer the <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> of praise to God continually, that is, the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> of our lips giving thanks to his name.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Pray for us: for we trust we have a good <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#006">conscience</a>, in all things willing to live honestly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> But I beseech you the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, that great <a href="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>, through the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>; to whom be <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> for ever and ever. <a href="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for I have written a letter unto you in few words.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Know ye that our brother <a href="../ebd/ebd367.htm#002">Timothy</a> is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#004">Italy</a> salute you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">Grace</a> be with you all. <a href="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</a>.<br>
