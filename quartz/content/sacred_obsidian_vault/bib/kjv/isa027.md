 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 27</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> In that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> shall punish <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#007">leviathan</a> the piercing <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#009">serpent</a>, even <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#007">leviathan</a> that crooked <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#009">serpent</a>; and he shall slay the <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#000">dragon</a> that is in the sea.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> In that day sing ye unto her, A vineyard of red <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> I the LORD do keep it; I will water it every moment: lest any hurt it, I will keep it night and day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">Fury</a> is not in me: who would set the briers and thorns against me in battle? I would go through them, I would burn them together.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Or let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me; and he shall make peace with me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> He shall cause them that come of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> to take root: <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> shall blossom and bud, and fill the face of the world with <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Hath he smitten him, as he smote those that smote him? or is he slain according to the slaughter of them that are slain by him?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> In measure, when it shooteth forth, thou wilt debate with it: he stayeth his rough wind in the day of the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a> wind.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> By this therefore shall the iniquity of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> be purged; and this is all the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> to take away his <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>; when he maketh all the stones of the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder, the groves and images shall not stand up.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Yet the defenced city shall be desolate, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</a> forsaken, and left like a <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>: there shall the <a href="../ebd/ebd069.htm#004">calf</a> feed, and there shall he lie down, and consume the branches thereof.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> When the boughs thereof are withered, they shall be broken off: the women come, and set them on fire: for it is a people of no understanding: therefore he that made them will not have <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> on them, and he that formed them will shew them no favour.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall beat off from the <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#002">channel</a> of the river unto the stream of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and ye shall be gathered one by one, O ye children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And it shall come to pass in that day, that the great trumpet shall be blown, and they shall come which were ready to perish in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</a>, and the outcasts in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and shall <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> the LORD in the holy <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> at <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
