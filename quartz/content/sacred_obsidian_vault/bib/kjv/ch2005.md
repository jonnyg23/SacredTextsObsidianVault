 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 5</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Thus all the work that <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> made for the house of the LORD was finished: and <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> brought in all the things that <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> his father had dedicated; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, and all the instruments, put he among the treasures of the house of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> assembled the elders of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, unto <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, to bring up the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> of the LORD out of the city of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, which is <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Wherefore all the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> assembled themselves unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a> which was in the seventh month.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And all the elders of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> came; and the Levites took up the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And they brought up the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a>, and all the holy vessels that were in the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a>, these did the priests and the Levites bring up.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Also <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a>, and all the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> that were assembled unto him before the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a>, sacrificed <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a> and oxen, which could not be told nor numbered for multitude.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And the priests brought in the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> of the LORD unto his place, to the <a href="../ebd/ebd280.htm#000">oracle</a> of the house, into the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubims:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> For the cherubims spread forth their wings over the place of the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a>, and the cherubims covered the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> and the staves thereof above.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And they drew out the staves of the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a>, that the ends of the staves were seen from the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> before the <a href="../ebd/ebd280.htm#000">oracle</a>; but they were not seen without. And there it is unto this day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> There was nothing in the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> save the two <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#006">tables</a> which <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> put therein at <a href="../ebd/ebd181.htm#009">Horeb</a>, when the LORD made a <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> with the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, when they came out of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place: (for all the priests that were present were sanctified, and did not then wait by course:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Also the Levites which were the singers, all of them of <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#002">Asaph</a>, of <a href="../ebd/ebd173.htm#009">Heman</a>, of <a href="../ebd/ebd199.htm#009">Jeduthun</a>, with their sons and their brethren, being arrayed in white <a href="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</a>, having <a href="../ebd/ebd095.htm#001">cymbals</a> and psalteries and harps, stood at the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a> end of the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a>, and with them an hundred and twenty priests sounding with <a href="../ebd/ebd373.htm#001">trumpets</a>:)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD; and when they lifted up their voice with the <a href="../ebd/ebd373.htm#001">trumpets</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd095.htm#001">cymbals</a> and instruments of musick, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> endureth for ever: that then the house was filled with a <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a>, even the house of the LORD;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> So that the priests could not stand to <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</a> by reason of the <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a>: for the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of the LORD had filled the house of God.<br>
