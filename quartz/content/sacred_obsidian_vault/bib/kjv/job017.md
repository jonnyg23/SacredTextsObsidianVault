 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 17</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are ready for me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Are there not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Lay down now, put me in a <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#005">surety</a> with thee; who is he that will strike hands with me?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> He that speaketh flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was as a <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#009">tabret</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members are as a <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Upright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the <a href="../ebd/ebd185.htm#006">hypocrite</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</a> hands shall be stronger and stronger.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot find one <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> man among you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the thoughts of my heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> They change the night into day: the light is short because of <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> If I wait, the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</a> is mine house: I have made my bed in the <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> I have said to corruption, Thou art my father: to the <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#000">worm</a>, Thou art my mother, and my sister.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And where is now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> They shall go down to the bars of the <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a>, when our rest together is in the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a>.<br>
