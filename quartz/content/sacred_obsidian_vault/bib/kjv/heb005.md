 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Hebrews Chapter 5</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> For every high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> So also <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> glorified not himself to be made an high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> As he saith also in another place, Thou art a <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> for ever after the order of Melchisedec.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Who in the days of his <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a> unto all them that obey him;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Called of God an high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> after the order of Melchisedec.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#000">milk</a>, and not of strong meat.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> For every one that useth <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#000">milk</a> is unskilful in the word of <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>: for he is a <a href="../ebd/ebd040.htm#009">babe</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.<br>
