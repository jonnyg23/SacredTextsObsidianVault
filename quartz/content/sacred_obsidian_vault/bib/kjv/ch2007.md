 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 7</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now when <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> had made an end of praying, the fire came down from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and consumed the burnt <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> and the sacrifices; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of the LORD filled the house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD, because the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of the LORD had filled the LORD's house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And when all the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> saw how the fire came down, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of the LORD upon the house, they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#003">pavement</a>, and worshipped, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> endureth for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Then the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> and all the people offered sacrifices before the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> offered a <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> of twenty and two thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>: so the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> and all the people dedicated the house of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And the priests waited on their offices: the Levites also with instruments of musick of the LORD, which <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> had made to praise the LORD, because his <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> endureth for ever, when <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> praised by their ministry; and the priests sounded <a href="../ebd/ebd373.htm#001">trumpets</a> before them, and all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> stood.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Moreover <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</a> of the peace offerings, because the brasen <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> which <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings, and the meat offerings, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Also at the same time <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> kept the <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> days, and all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> with him, a very great <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a>, from the entering in of <a href="../ebd/ebd160.htm#005">Hamath</a> unto the river of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> days, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> days.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away into their tents, glad and merry in heart for the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</a> that the LORD had shewed unto <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, and to <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a>, and to <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> his people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Thus <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> finished the house of the LORD, and the king's house: and all that came into Solomon's heart to make in the house of the LORD, and in his own house, he prosperously effected.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And the LORD appeared to <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> by night, and said unto him, I have heard thy <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a>, and have <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> this place to myself for an house of <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> If I shut up <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> that there be no <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a>, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and will forgive their <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>, and will heal their land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a> that is made in this place.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> For now have I <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> and sanctified this house, that my name may be there for ever: and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> thy father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and shalt observe my statutes and my judgments;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Then will I stablish the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> of thy kingdom, according as I have covenanted with <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments, which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> them;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have sanctified for my name, will I cast out of my sight, and will make it to be a <a href="../ebd/ebd301.htm#002">proverb</a> and a byword among all nations.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And this house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to every one that passeth by it; so that he shall say, Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and unto this house?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And it shall be answered, Because they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought them forth out of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath he brought all this evil upon them.<br>
