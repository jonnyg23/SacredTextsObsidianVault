 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Of every <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that are not <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</a> by two, the male and his female.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> For yet <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> days, and I will cause it to <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a> upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd274.htm#002">Noah</a> did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.<br>
 </p>

 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd274.htm#002">Noah</a> went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a>, because of the waters of the <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#000">flood</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Of <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</a> beasts, and of beasts that are not <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</a>, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> There went in two and two unto <a href="../ebd/ebd274.htm#002">Noah</a> into the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a>, the male and the female, as God had commanded <a href="../ebd/ebd274.htm#002">Noah</a>.<br>
 </p>

 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great <a href="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</a> broken up, and the windows of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> were opened.<br>
 </p>

 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> They, and every <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> after his kind, and all the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a> after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every <a href="../ebd/ebd059.htm#000">bird</a> of every sort.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And they went in unto <a href="../ebd/ebd274.htm#002">Noah</a> into the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a>, two and two of all <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, wherein is the breath of life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And they that went in, went in male and female of all <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#000">flood</a> was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a>, and it was lift up above the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> went upon the face of the waters.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, were covered.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And all <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a>, and of <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a>, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>; and they were destroyed from the earth: and <a href="../ebd/ebd274.htm#002">Noah</a> only remained alive, and they that were with him in the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a>.<br>
 </p>
