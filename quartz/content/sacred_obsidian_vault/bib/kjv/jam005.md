 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: James Chapter 5</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Your <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> against you, and shall eat your <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#002">sabaoth</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the <a href="../ebd/ebd185.htm#002">husbandman</a> waiteth for the precious <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> standeth before the door.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, neither by the earth, neither by any other <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</a>: but let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing <a href="../ebd/ebd301.htm#005">psalms</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a> of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a> of a righteous man availeth much.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#002">Elias</a> was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a>: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And he prayed again, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> gave <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a>, and the earth brought forth her <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.<br>
 </p>
