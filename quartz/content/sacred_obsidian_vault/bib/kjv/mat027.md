 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Matthew Chapter 27</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> to put him to death:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#001">Judas</a>, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> to the chief priests and elders,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>. And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And he cast down the <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>, and departed, and went and hanged himself.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And the chief priests took the <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a>, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#000">treasury</a>, because it is the price of <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Wherefore that field was called, The field of <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>, unto this day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>, saying, And they took the thirty <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> did value;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</a> of the Jews? And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> said unto him, Thou sayest.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> against thee?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Now at that <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a> the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And they had then a notable prisoner, called <a href="../ebd/ebd044.htm#002">Barabbas</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? <a href="../ebd/ebd044.htm#002">Barabbas</a>, or <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> which is called <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a> because of him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask <a href="../ebd/ebd044.htm#002">Barabbas</a>, and destroy <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, <a href="../ebd/ebd044.htm#002">Barabbas</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> which is called <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of this just person: see ye to it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Then answered all the people, and said, His <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> be on us, and on our children.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Then released he <a href="../ebd/ebd044.htm#002">Barabbas</a> unto them: and when he had scourged <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, he delivered him to be crucified.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Then the soldiers of the governor took <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And they stripped him, and put on him a <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#005">scarlet</a> robe.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And when they had platted a <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</a> of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a <a href="../ebd/ebd309.htm#000">reed</a> in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, <a href="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">Hail</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</a> of the Jews!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And they spit upon him, and took the <a href="../ebd/ebd309.htm#000">reed</a>, and smote him on the head.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And as they came out, they found a man of <a href="../ebd/ebd095.htm#004">Cyrene</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a> by name: him they compelled to bear his <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#000">cross</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And when they were come unto a place called <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#004">Golgotha</a>, that is to say, a place of a skull,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> They gave him <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#006">vinegar</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> mingled with <a href="../ebd/ebd142.htm#000">gall</a>: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</a> down they watched him there;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">JESUS</a> THE <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">KING</a> OF THE JEWS.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> And saying, Thou that destroyest the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>, and buildest it in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#000">cross</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</a> and elders, said,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, let him now come down from the <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#000">cross</a>, and we will believe him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> Now from the sixth hour there was <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a> over all the land unto the ninth hour.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="046">46</a> And about the ninth hour <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> cried with a loud voice, saying, <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#002">lama</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#001">sabachthani</a>? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="047">47</a> Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#002">Elias</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="048">48</a> And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#006">vinegar</a>, and put it on a <a href="../ebd/ebd309.htm#000">reed</a>, and gave him to <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="049">49</a> The rest said, Let be, let us see whether <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#002">Elias</a> will come to save him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="050">50</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">ghost</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="051">51</a> And, behold, the <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#001">veil</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> was <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</a> in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="052">52</a> And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="053">53</a> And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="054">54</a> Now when the <a href="../ebd/ebd075.htm#004">centurion</a>, and they that were with him, watching <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, saw the <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#009">earthquake</a>, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="055">55</a> And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> from <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a>, ministering unto him:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="056">56</a> Among which was <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd236.htm#005">Magdalene</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</a> the mother of <a href="../ebd/ebd196.htm#007">James</a> and Joses, and the mother of Zebedees children.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="057">57</a> When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>, who also himself was Jesus' <a href="../ebd/ebd104.htm#003">disciple</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="058">58</a> He went to Pilate, and begged the body of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="059">59</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> had taken the body, he wrapped it in a <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</a> cloth,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="060">60</a> And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a>: and he rolled a great <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> to the door of the <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</a>, and departed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="061">61</a> And there was <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd236.htm#005">Magdalene</a>, and the other <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</a> over against the <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="062">62</a> Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a> came together unto Pilate,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="063">63</a> Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="064">64</a> Command therefore that the <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</a> be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="065">65</a> Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as sure as ye can.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="066">66</a> So they went, and made the <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</a> sure, sealing the <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a>, and setting a watch.<br>
