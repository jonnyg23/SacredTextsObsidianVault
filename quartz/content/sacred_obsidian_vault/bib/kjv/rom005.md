 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Romans Chapter 5</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> By whom also we have access by faith into this <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And not only so, but we <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> in tribulations also: knowing that <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#005">tribulation</a> worketh patience;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And patience, experience; and experience, hope:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a> which is given unto us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> For when we were yet without strength, in due time <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> died for the ungodly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> died for us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Much more then, being now justified by his <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>, we shall be saved from wrath through him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, by whom we have now received the <a href="../ebd/ebd036.htm#004">atonement</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Wherefore, as by one man <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> entered into the world, and death by <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> (For until the law <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> was in the world: but <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> is not imputed when there is no law.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Nevertheless death reigned from <a href="../ebd/ebd007.htm#007">Adam</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> But not as the offence, so also is the free <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</a>. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> of God, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</a> by <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a>, which is by one man, <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, hath abounded unto many.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</a>: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</a> is of many offences unto <a href="../ebd/ebd214.htm#009">justification</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> and of the <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> shall reign in life by one, <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> of one the free <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</a> came upon all men unto <a href="../ebd/ebd214.htm#009">justification</a> of life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> abounded, <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> did much more abound:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> That as <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> hath reigned unto death, even so might <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> reign through <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> unto eternal life by <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> our Lord.<br>
