 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 4</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> For I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> She shall give to thine head an ornament of <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a>: a <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> shall she deliver to thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Take <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a> hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she is thy life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> For they eat the <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> of wickedness, and <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> of violence.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> The way of the wicked is as <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>: they know not at what they stumble.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> My son, attend to my words; incline thine <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a> unto my sayings.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil.<br>
