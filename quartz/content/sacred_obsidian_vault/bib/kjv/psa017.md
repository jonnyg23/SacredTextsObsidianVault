 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Psalms Chapter 17</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry, give <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a> unto my <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a>, that goeth not out of feigned lips.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes behold the things that are equal.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the night; thou hast tried me, and shalt find nothing; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#003">destroyer</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline thine <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a> unto me, and hear my speech.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Keep me as the <a href="../ebd/ebd027.htm#004">apple</a> of the eye, hide me under the <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</a> of thy wings,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> From the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly enemies, who compass me about.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> They are inclosed in their own <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</a>: with their mouth they speak proudly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#005">bowing</a> down to the earth;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked, which is thy <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> From men which are thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world, which have their portion in this life, and whose <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</a> thou fillest with thy hid treasure: they are full of children, and leave the rest of their substance to their babes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> As for me, I will behold thy face in <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.<br>
