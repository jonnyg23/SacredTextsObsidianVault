 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Genesis Chapter 28</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a> called <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd057.htm#003">Bethuel</a> thy mother's father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughers of <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</a> thy mother's brother.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And God Almighty <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a> thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And give thee the blessing of <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a>, which God gave unto <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a> sent away <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>: and he went to Padanaram unto <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</a>, son of <a href="../ebd/ebd057.htm#003">Bethuel</a> the Syrian, the brother of <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#001">Rebekah</a>, Jacob's and Esau's mother.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> When <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</a> saw that <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a> had blessed <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, and sent him away to Padanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughers of <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And that <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Padanaram;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</a> seeing that the daughters of <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</a> pleased not <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a> his father;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Then went <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#005">Ishmael</a>, and took unto the wives which he had <a href="../ebd/ebd237.htm#002">Mahalath</a> the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#005">Ishmael</a> Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> went out from <a href="../ebd/ebd050.htm#008">Beersheba</a>, and went toward <a href="../ebd/ebd163.htm#007">Haran</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And he dreamed, and behold a <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#000">ladder</a> set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> thy father, and the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a>: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And thy seed shall be as the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a> of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a>, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew it not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> rose up early in the morning, and took the <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#007">pillar</a>, and poured oil upon the top of it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And he called the name of that place <a href="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</a>: but the name of that city was called <a href="../ebd/ebd233.htm#006">Luz</a> at the first.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> to eat, and raiment to put on,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> So that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the LORD be my God:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And this <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a>, which I have set for a <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#007">pillar</a>, shall be God's house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.<br>
