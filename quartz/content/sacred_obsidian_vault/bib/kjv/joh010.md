 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: John Chapter 10</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> But he that entereth in by the door is the <a href="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> To him the <a href="../ebd/ebd299.htm#000">porter</a> openeth; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a> hear his voice: and he calleth his own <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a> by name, and leadeth them out.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And when he putteth forth his own <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>, he goeth before them, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a> follow him: for they know his voice.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a> will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> This <a href="../ebd/ebd284.htm#003">parable</a> spake <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a> did not hear them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> I am the good <a href="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</a>: the good <a href="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</a> giveth his life for the <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> But he that is an <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#004">hireling</a>, and not the <a href="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</a>, whose own the <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a> are not, seeth the <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#001">wolf</a> coming, and leaveth the <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>, and fleeth: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#001">wolf</a> catcheth them, and scattereth the <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#004">hireling</a> fleeth, because he is an <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#004">hireling</a>, and careth not for the <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> I am the good <a href="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</a>, and know my <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>, and am known of mine.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And other <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a> I have, which are not of this <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#007">fold</a>: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#007">fold</a>, and one <a href="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And many of them said, He hath a <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</a>, and is mad; why hear ye him?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</a>. Can a <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</a> open the eyes of the <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And it was at <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a> of the dedication, and it was winter.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> walked in the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> in Solomon's porch.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, tell us plainly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> of me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> But ye believe not, because ye are not of my <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>, as I said unto you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> My <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a> hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> I and my Father are one.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Then the Jews took up stones again to <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> me?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> thee not; but for <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#005">blasphemy</a>; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#005">scripture</a> cannot be broken;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> And went away again beyond <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a> into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no <a href="../ebd/ebd256.htm#002">miracle</a>: but all things that John spake of this man were true.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> And many believed on him there.<br>
