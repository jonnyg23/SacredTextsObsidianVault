 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Luke Chapter 16</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to <a href="../ebd/ebd051.htm#001">beg</a> I am ashamed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> So he called every one of his lord's debtors unto him, and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#000">wheat</a>. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a> wiser than the children of light.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the <a href="../ebd/ebd239.htm#007">mammon</a> of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> habitations.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> He that is <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a> in that which is least is <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a> also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> If therefore ye have not been <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a> in the unrighteous <a href="../ebd/ebd239.htm#007">mammon</a>, who will commit to your trust the true riches?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And if ye have not been <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a> in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and <a href="../ebd/ebd239.htm#007">mammon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a> also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</a> in the sight of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And it is easier for <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> and earth to pass, than one <a href="../ebd/ebd368.htm#006">tittle</a> of the law to fail.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth <a href="../ebd/ebd010.htm#009">adultery</a>: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth <a href="../ebd/ebd010.htm#009">adultery</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine <a href="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</a>, and fared sumptuously every day:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And there was a certain beggar named <a href="../ebd/ebd225.htm#003">Lazarus</a>, which was laid at his <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a>, full of sores,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#008">bosom</a>: the rich man also died, and was buried;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And in <a href="../ebd/ebd173.htm#003">hell</a> he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> afar off, and <a href="../ebd/ebd225.htm#003">Lazarus</a> in his <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#008">bosom</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And he cried and said, Father <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, have <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> on me, and send <a href="../ebd/ebd225.htm#003">Lazarus</a>, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise <a href="../ebd/ebd225.htm#003">Lazarus</a> evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of <a href="../ebd/ebd370.htm#009">torment</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> saith unto him, They have <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> and the prophets; let them hear them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And he said, Nay, father <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And he said unto him, If they hear not <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.<br>
