 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Chronicles Chapter 12</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now these are they that came to <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd393.htm#003">Ziklag</a>, while he yet kept himself close because of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd220.htm#007">Kish</a>: and they were among the mighty men, helpers of the war.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in hurling stones and shooting <a href="../ebd/ebd032.htm#005">arrows</a> out of a <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a>, even of Saul's brethren of <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> The chief was <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#008">Ahiezer</a>, then <a href="../ebd/ebd208.htm#000">Joash</a>, the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd334.htm#004">Shemaah</a> the Gibeathite; and <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#007">Jeziel</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd288.htm#008">Pelet</a>, the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd038.htm#000">Azmaveth</a>; and <a href="../ebd/ebd053.htm#001">Berachah</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd025.htm#006">Antothite</a>.<br>

 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And of the Gadites there separated themselves unto <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> into the hold to the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> men of might, and men of war fit for the battle, that could handle <a href="../ebd/ebd337.htm#001">shield</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#000">buckler</a>, whose faces were like the faces of <a href="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</a>, and were as swift as the roes upon the mountains;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd129.htm#004">Ezer</a> the first, <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#001">Obadiah</a> the second, <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#008">Eliab</a> the third,<br>

 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Attai the sixth, <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#006">Eliel</a> the seventh,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd208.htm#009">Johanan</a> the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> the tenth, <a href="../ebd/ebd235.htm#005">Machbanai</a> the eleventh.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> These were of the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#007">Gad</a>, captains of the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a>: one of the least was over an hundred, and the greatest over a thousand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> These are they that went over <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a> in the first month, when it had overflown all his banks; and they put to flight all them of the valleys, both toward the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a>, and toward the west.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And there came of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> to the hold unto <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> went out to meet them, and answered and said unto them, If ye be come peaceably unto me to help me, mine heart shall be knit unto you: but if ye be come to betray me to mine enemies, seeing there is no wrong in mine hands, the God of our fathers look thereon, and rebuke it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Then the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> came upon <a href="../ebd/ebd019.htm#004">Amasai</a>, who was chief of the captains, and he said, Thine are we, <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, and on thy side, thou son of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#005">Jesse</a>: peace, peace be unto thee, and peace be to thine helpers; for thy God helpeth thee. Then <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> received them, and made them captains of the band.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And there fell some of <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, when he came with the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> against <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> to battle: but they helped them not: for the lords of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> upon advisement sent him away, saying, He will fall to his master <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> to the jeopardy of our heads.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> As he went to <a href="../ebd/ebd393.htm#003">Ziklag</a>, there fell to him of <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd009.htm#004">Adnah</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#002">Jozabad</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd199.htm#007">Jediael</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd252.htm#009">Michael</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#002">Jozabad</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#008">Elihu</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd393.htm#006">Zilthai</a>, captains of the <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</a> that were of <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And they helped <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> against the band of the rovers: for they were all mighty men of valour, and were captains in the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> For at that time day by day there came to <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> to help him, until it was a great <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a>, like the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And these are the numbers of the <a href="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">bands</a> that were ready armed to the war, and came to <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#004">Hebron</a>, to turn the kingdom of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> to him, according to the word of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> The children of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> that bare <a href="../ebd/ebd337.htm#001">shield</a> and spear were six thousand and eight hundred, ready armed to the war.<br>

 </p>
