 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 16</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then the word of the LORD came to <a href="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd162.htm#003">Hanani</a> against <a href="../ebd/ebd040.htm#008">Baasha</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a>, and made thee <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</a> over my people <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; and thou hast walked in the way of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a>, and hast made my people <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>, to provoke me to <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> with their sins;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Behold, I will take away the posterity of <a href="../ebd/ebd040.htm#008">Baasha</a>, and the posterity of his house; and will make thy house like the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#003">Nebat</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Him that dieth of <a href="../ebd/ebd040.htm#008">Baasha</a> in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Now the rest of the acts of <a href="../ebd/ebd040.htm#008">Baasha</a>, and what he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#003">chronicles</a> of the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd040.htm#008">Baasha</a> slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah: and <a href="../ebd/ebd114.htm#002">Elah</a> his son reigned in his stead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And also by the hand of the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd162.htm#003">Hanani</a> came the word of the LORD against <a href="../ebd/ebd040.htm#008">Baasha</a>, and against his house, even for all the evil that he did in the sight of the LORD, in provoking him to <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> with the work of his hands, in being like the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a>; and because he killed him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> In the twenty and sixth year of <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> began <a href="../ebd/ebd114.htm#002">Elah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd040.htm#008">Baasha</a> to reign over <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> in Tirzah, two years.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And his servant <a href="../ebd/ebd393.htm#009">Zimri</a>, captain of half his chariots, conspired against him, as he was in Tirzah, drinking himself <a href="../ebd/ebd108.htm#007">drunk</a> in the house of Arza steward of his house in Tirzah.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd393.htm#009">Zimri</a> went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty and seventh year of <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and reigned in his stead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a>, that he slew all the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd040.htm#008">Baasha</a>: he left him not one that pisseth against a wall, neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his friends.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Thus did <a href="../ebd/ebd393.htm#009">Zimri</a> destroy all the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd040.htm#008">Baasha</a>, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake against <a href="../ebd/ebd040.htm#008">Baasha</a> by <a href="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> For all the sins of <a href="../ebd/ebd040.htm#008">Baasha</a>, and the sins of <a href="../ebd/ebd114.htm#002">Elah</a> his son, by which they sinned, and by which they made <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>, in provoking the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> with their vanities.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Now the rest of the acts of <a href="../ebd/ebd114.htm#002">Elah</a>, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#003">chronicles</a> of the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> In the twenty and seventh year of <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> did <a href="../ebd/ebd393.htm#009">Zimri</a> reign <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> days in Tirzah. And the people were encamped against <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#007">Gibbethon</a>, which belonged to the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And the people that were encamped heard say, <a href="../ebd/ebd393.htm#009">Zimri</a> hath conspired, and hath also slain the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>: wherefore all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> made <a href="../ebd/ebd278.htm#006">Omri</a>, the captain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> over <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> that day in the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd278.htm#006">Omri</a> went up from <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#007">Gibbethon</a>, and all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> with him, and they besieged Tirzah.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And it came to pass, when <a href="../ebd/ebd393.htm#009">Zimri</a> saw that the city was taken, that he went into the <a href="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</a> of the king's house, and burnt the king's house over him with fire, and died.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the LORD, in walking in the way of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a>, and in his <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> which he did, to make <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Now the rest of the acts of <a href="../ebd/ebd393.htm#009">Zimri</a>, and his treason that he wrought, are they not written in the book of the <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#003">chronicles</a> of the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Then were the people of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> divided into two parts: half of the people followed <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#009">Tibni</a> the son of Ginath, to make him <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>; and half followed <a href="../ebd/ebd278.htm#006">Omri</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> But the people that followed <a href="../ebd/ebd278.htm#006">Omri</a> prevailed against the people that followed <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#009">Tibni</a> the son of Ginath: so <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#009">Tibni</a> died, and <a href="../ebd/ebd278.htm#006">Omri</a> reigned.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> In the thirty and first year of <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> began <a href="../ebd/ebd278.htm#006">Omri</a> to reign over <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And he bought the hill <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a> of Shemer for two talents of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd278.htm#006">Omri</a> wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did worse than all that were before him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> For he walked in all the way of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#003">Nebat</a>, and in his <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> wherewith he made <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>, to provoke the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> with their vanities.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Now the rest of the acts of <a href="../ebd/ebd278.htm#006">Omri</a> which he did, and his might that he shewed, are they not written in the book of the <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#003">chronicles</a> of the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd278.htm#006">Omri</a> slept with his fathers, and was buried in <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a> his son reigned in his stead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And in the thirty and eighth year of <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> began <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd278.htm#006">Omri</a> to reign over <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd278.htm#006">Omri</a> reigned over <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a> twenty and two years.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd278.htm#006">Omri</a> did evil in the sight of the LORD above all that were before him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#003">Nebat</a>, that he took to wife <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#006">Jezebel</a> the daughter of Ethbaal <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of the Zidonians, and went and served <a href="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</a>, and worshipped him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And he reared up an <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> for <a href="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</a> in the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</a>, which he had built in <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a> made a <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#008">grove</a>; and <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a> did more to provoke the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> than all the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> that were before him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> In his days did <a href="../ebd/ebd178.htm#000">Hiel</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd055.htm#007">Bethelite</a> build <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#008">Jericho</a>: he laid the foundation thereof in <a href="../ebd/ebd004.htm#003">Abiram</a> his firstborn, and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son <a href="../ebd/ebd326.htm#003">Segub</a>, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd275.htm#006">Nun</a>.<br>
