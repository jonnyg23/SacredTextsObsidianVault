 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Mark Chapter 8</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> called his disciples unto him, and saith unto them,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these men with <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> here in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">Seven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before them; and they did set them before the people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> baskets.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#004">Dalmanutha</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a> came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, tempting him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And he sighed deeply in his <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>, and saith, Why doth this <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a> seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Now the disciples had forgotten to take <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#000">leaven</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a>, and of the <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#000">leaven</a> of Herod.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have no <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> knew it, he saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye have no <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And when the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? And they said, <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">Seven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And he cometh to <a href="../ebd/ebd056.htm#009">Bethsaida</a>; and they bring a <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a> man unto him, and besought him to touch him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And he took the <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a> man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> After that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell it to any in the town.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> went out, and his disciples, into the towns of <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#003">Caesarea</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd293.htm#009">Philippi</a>: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And they answered, John the Baptist; but some say, <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#002">Elias</a>; and others, One of the prophets.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief priests, and <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</a>, and be killed, and after three days rise again.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And he spake that saying openly. And <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> took him, and began to rebuke him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a>, saying, Get thee behind me, <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</a>: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#000">cross</a>, and follow me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a>; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of his Father with the holy angels.<br>
