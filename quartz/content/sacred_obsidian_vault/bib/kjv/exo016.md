 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Exodus Chapter 16</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And they took their <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</a> from <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#001">Elim</a>, and all the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a> of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> came unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">Sin</a>, which is between <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#001">Elim</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#009">Sinai</a>, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And the whole <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a> of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> murmured against <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, when we sat by the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> pots, and when we did eat <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Then said the LORD unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, Behold, I will <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a> said unto all the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, At even, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And in the morning, then ye shall see the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of the LORD; for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: and what are we, that ye murmur against us?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> said, This shall be, when the LORD shall give you in the evening <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> to eat, and in the morning <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> to the full; for that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> spake unto <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a>, Say unto all the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a> of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, Come near before the LORD: for he hath heard your murmurings.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And it came to pass, as <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a> spake unto the whole <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a> of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, that they looked toward the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, and, behold, the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of the LORD appeared in the <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And the LORD spake unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> I have heard the murmurings of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: speak unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, and in the morning ye shall be filled with <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>; and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And it came to pass, that at even the <a href="../ebd/ebd303.htm#002">quails</a> came up, and covered the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a>: and in the morning the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#008">dew</a> lay round about the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And when the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#008">dew</a> that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar <a href="../ebd/ebd138.htm#009">frost</a> on the ground.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And when the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> saw it, they said one to another, It is <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#006">manna</a>: for they wist not what it was. And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> said unto them, This is the <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> which the LORD hath given you to eat.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it every man according to his <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#006">eating</a>, an <a href="../ebd/ebd278.htm#005">omer</a> for every man, according to the number of your persons; take ye every man for them which are in his tents.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> did so, and gathered, some more, some less.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And when they did mete it with an <a href="../ebd/ebd278.htm#005">omer</a>, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#006">eating</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> was wroth with them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#006">eating</a>: and when the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> waxed hot, it melted.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a> came and told <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath said, To morrow is the rest of the holy <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> unto the LORD: <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#001">bake</a> that which ye will <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#001">bake</a> to day, and <a href="../ebd/ebd326.htm#001">seethe</a> that ye will <a href="../ebd/ebd326.htm#001">seethe</a>; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And they laid it up till the morning, as <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#000">worm</a> therein.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> said, Eat that to day; for to day is a <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> unto the LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a>, in it there shall be none.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> See, for that the LORD hath given you the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a>, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> So the people rested on the seventh day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> called the name thereof <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#006">Manna</a>: and it was like <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#001">coriander</a> seed, white; and the taste of it was like <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#003">wafers</a> made with <a href="../ebd/ebd181.htm#001">honey</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> said, This is the thing which the LORD commandeth, Fill an <a href="../ebd/ebd278.htm#005">omer</a> of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> wherewith I have fed you in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, when I brought you forth from the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a>, Take a pot, and put an <a href="../ebd/ebd278.htm#005">omer</a> full of <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#006">manna</a> therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> As the LORD commanded <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, so <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a> laid it up before the <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">Testimony</a>, to be kept.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> did eat <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#006">manna</a> forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#006">manna</a>, until they came unto the borders of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> Now an <a href="../ebd/ebd278.htm#005">omer</a> is the tenth part of an <a href="../ebd/ebd122.htm#003">ephah</a>.<br>
