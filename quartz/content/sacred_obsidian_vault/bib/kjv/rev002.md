 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Revelation Chapter 2</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the church of <a href="../ebd/ebd122.htm#007">Ephesus</a> write; These things saith he that holdeth the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd350.htm#008">stars</a> in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> golden candlesticks;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy <a href="../ebd/ebd071.htm#001">candlestick</a> out of his place, except thou repent.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the <a href="../ebd/ebd272.htm#006">Nicolaitanes</a>, which I also hate.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> He that hath an <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a>, let him hear what the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the <a href="../ebd/ebd284.htm#004">paradise</a> of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the church in <a href="../ebd/ebd346.htm#007">Smyrna</a> write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> I know thy works, and <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#005">tribulation</a>, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#005">blasphemy</a> of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</a> shall cast some of you into <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a>, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#005">tribulation</a> ten days: be thou <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a> unto death, and I will give thee a <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</a> of life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> He that hath an <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a>, let him hear what the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And to the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the church in <a href="../ebd/ebd290.htm#004">Pergamos</a> write; These things saith he which hath the sharp <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> with two edges;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where Satan's seat is: and thou holdest <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a> my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein <a href="../ebd/ebd025.htm#003">Antipas</a> was my <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#008">martyr</a>, who was slain among you, where <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</a> dwelleth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</a>, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the <a href="../ebd/ebd272.htm#006">Nicolaitanes</a>, which thing I hate.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> of my mouth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> He that hath an <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a>, let him hear what the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#006">manna</a>, and will give him a white <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a>, and in the <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the church in <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#004">Thyatira</a> write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> I know thy works, and <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#009">charity</a>, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the first.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#006">Jezebel</a>, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</a>, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And I gave her space to repent of her <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</a>; and she repented not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit <a href="../ebd/ebd010.htm#009">adultery</a> with her into great <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#005">tribulation</a>, except they repent of their deeds.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#001">reins</a> and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> But unto you I say, and unto the rest in <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#004">Thyatira</a>, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</a>, as they speak; I will put upon you none other <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> But that which ye have already hold <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a> till I come.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And he shall rule them with a rod of <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a>; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And I will give him the morning star.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> He that hath an <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a>, let him hear what the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> saith unto the churches.<br>
