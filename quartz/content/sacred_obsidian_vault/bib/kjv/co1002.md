 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Corinthians Chapter 2</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</a> of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> For I determined not to know any thing among you, save <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, and him crucified.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> and of power:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> But we speak the wisdom of God in a <a href="../ebd/ebd263.htm#006">mystery</a>, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a> heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> But God hath revealed them unto us by his <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a>: for the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> searcheth all things, yea, the <a href="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</a> things of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Now we have received, not the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> of the world, but the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a> teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> But the natural man receiveth not the things of the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him?  But we have the mind of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
