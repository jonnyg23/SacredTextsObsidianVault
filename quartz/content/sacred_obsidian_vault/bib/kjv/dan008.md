 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Daniel Chapter 8</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> In the third year of the reign of <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#001">Belshazzar</a> a <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a> appeared unto me, even unto me <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a>, after that which appeared unto me at the first.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And I saw in a <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a>; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at <a href="../ebd/ebd342.htm#003">Shushan</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</a>, which is in the province of <a href="../ebd/ebd114.htm#003">Elam</a>; and I saw in a <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a>, and I was by the river of <a href="../ebd/ebd374.htm#004">Ulai</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a <a href="../ebd/ebd306.htm#003">ram</a> which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> I saw the <a href="../ebd/ebd306.htm#003">ram</a> pushing <a href="../ebd/ebd380.htm#008">westward</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd275.htm#002">northward</a>, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And as I was considering, behold, an he <a href="../ebd/ebd151.htm#001">goat</a> came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd151.htm#001">goat</a> had a notable <a href="../ebd/ebd182.htm#003">horn</a> between his eyes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And he came to the <a href="../ebd/ebd306.htm#003">ram</a> that had two horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</a> of his power.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And I saw him come close unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd306.htm#003">ram</a>, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the <a href="../ebd/ebd306.htm#003">ram</a>, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the <a href="../ebd/ebd306.htm#003">ram</a> to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the <a href="../ebd/ebd306.htm#003">ram</a> out of his hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Therefore the he <a href="../ebd/ebd151.htm#001">goat</a> waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great <a href="../ebd/ebd182.htm#003">horn</a> was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#009">winds</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And out of one of them came forth a little <a href="../ebd/ebd182.htm#003">horn</a>, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a>, and toward the pleasant land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And it waxed great, even to the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>; and it cast down some of the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> and of the <a href="../ebd/ebd350.htm#008">stars</a> to the ground, and stamped upon them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Yea, he magnified himself even to the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a>, and by him the daily <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> was taken away, and the place of the <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</a> was cast down.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And an <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> was given him against the daily <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain saint which spake, How long shall be the <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a> concerning the daily <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a>, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</a> and the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> to be trodden under foot?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</a> be cleansed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And it came to pass, when I, even I <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a>, had seen the <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a>, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And I heard a man's voice between the banks of <a href="../ebd/ebd374.htm#004">Ulai</a>, which called, and said, <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#006">Gabriel</a>, make this man to understand the <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a <a href="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</a> sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end shall be.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd306.htm#003">ram</a> which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd246.htm#001">Media</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd290.htm#009">Persia</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And the rough <a href="../ebd/ebd151.htm#001">goat</a> is the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of Grecia: and the great <a href="../ebd/ebd182.htm#003">horn</a> that is between his eyes is the first <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">Prince</a> of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a> of the evening and the morning which was told is true: wherefore shut thou up the <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a>; for it shall be for many days.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And I <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a> fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose up, and did the king's business; and I was astonished at the <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a>, but none understood it.<br>
