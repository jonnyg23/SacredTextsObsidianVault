 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Genesis Chapter 16</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now <a href="../ebd/ebd322.htm#004">Sarai</a> Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had an <a href="../ebd/ebd162.htm#008">handmaid</a>, an Egyptian, whose name was <a href="../ebd/ebd158.htm#005">Hagar</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd322.htm#004">Sarai</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#004">Abram</a>, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#004">Abram</a> hearkened to the voice of <a href="../ebd/ebd322.htm#004">Sarai</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd322.htm#004">Sarai</a> Abram's wife took <a href="../ebd/ebd158.htm#005">Hagar</a> her maid the Egyptian, after <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#004">Abram</a> had dwelt ten years in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</a>, and gave her to her husband <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#004">Abram</a> to be his wife.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And he went in unto <a href="../ebd/ebd158.htm#005">Hagar</a>, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd322.htm#004">Sarai</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#004">Abram</a>, My wrong be upon thee: I have given my maid into thy <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#008">bosom</a>; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> between me and thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#004">Abram</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd322.htm#004">Sarai</a>, Behold, thy maid is in thine hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when <a href="../ebd/ebd322.htm#004">Sarai</a> dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the LORD found her by a <a href="../ebd/ebd138.htm#000">fountain</a> of water in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, by the <a href="../ebd/ebd138.htm#000">fountain</a> in the way to <a href="../ebd/ebd342.htm#002">Shur</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And he said, <a href="../ebd/ebd158.htm#005">Hagar</a>, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress <a href="../ebd/ebd322.htm#004">Sarai</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with child and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#005">Ishmael</a>; because the LORD hath heard thy affliction.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; behold, it is between <a href="../ebd/ebd215.htm#003">Kadesh</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd053.htm#004">Bered</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd158.htm#005">Hagar</a> bare <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#004">Abram</a> a son: and <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#004">Abram</a> called his son's name, which <a href="../ebd/ebd158.htm#005">Hagar</a> bare, <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#005">Ishmael</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#004">Abram</a> was fourscore and six years old, when <a href="../ebd/ebd158.htm#005">Hagar</a> bare <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#005">Ishmael</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#004">Abram</a>.<br>
