 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Romans Chapter 15</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edification.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> For even <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> That ye may with one mind and one mouth <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#005">glorify</a> God, even the Father of our Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Wherefore receive ye one another, as <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> also received us to the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Now I say that <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> was a <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</a> for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And that the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a> might <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#005">glorify</a> God for his <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a>; as it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>, and sing unto thy name.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And again he saith, Rejoice, ye <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>, with his people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And again, Praise the Lord, all ye <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>; and laud him, all ye people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And again, <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#003">Esaias</a> saith, There shall be a root of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#005">Jesse</a>, and he that shall rise to reign over the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>; in him shall the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a> trust.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also are full of <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</a>, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> that is given to me of God,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> That I should be the <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> to the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>, ministering the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a> of God, that the <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> up of the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a> might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> I have therefore whereof I may <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> through <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> in those things which pertain to God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> hath not wrought by me, to make the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a> obedient, by word and deed,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> of God; so that from <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and round about unto <a href="../ebd/ebd187.htm#004">Illyricum</a>, I have fully preached the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Yea, so have I strived to preach the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a>, not where <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> was named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come unto you;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Whensoever I take my <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</a> into <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#002">Spain</a>, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</a>, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> But now I go unto <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</a> unto the saints.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> For it hath pleased them of <a href="../ebd/ebd235.htm#003">Macedonia</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd006.htm#004">Achaia</a> to make a certain contribution for the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> saints which are at <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a> have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</a> unto them in <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#008">carnal</a> things.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a>, I will come by you into <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#002">Spain</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#007">fulness</a> of the blessing of the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> Christ's sake, and for the love of the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a>, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea; and that my service which I have for <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> may be accepted of the saints;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Now the God of peace be with you all. <a href="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</a>.<br>
