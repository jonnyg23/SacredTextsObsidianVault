 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 15</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> of God came upon <a href="../ebd/ebd037.htm#005">Azariah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#009">Oded</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And he went out to meet <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a>, and said unto him, Hear ye me, <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a>, and all <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a>; The LORD is with you, while ye be with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Now for a long season <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> hath been without the true God, and without a teaching <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, and without law.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> But when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and sought him, he was found of them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the countries.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God did vex them with all adversity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work shall be rewarded.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a> heard these words, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#007">prophecy</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#009">Oded</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a>, and out of the cities which he had taken from <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a>, and renewed the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> of the LORD, that was before the porch of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And he gathered all <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a>, and the strangers with them out of <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</a>, and out of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#002">Simeon</a>: for they fell to him out of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> in abundance, when they saw that the LORD his God was with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> So they gathered themselves together at <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And they offered unto the LORD the same time, of the spoil which they had brought, <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> hundred oxen and <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> thousand <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And they entered into a <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> to seek the LORD God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> That whosoever would not seek the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And they sware unto the LORD with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with <a href="../ebd/ebd373.htm#001">trumpets</a>, and with cornets.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And all <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> rejoiced at the <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</a>: for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and the LORD gave them rest round about.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And also concerning <a href="../ebd/ebd234.htm#004">Maachah</a> the mother of <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, he removed her from being <a href="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</a>, because she had made an <a href="../ebd/ebd186.htm#006">idol</a> in a <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#008">grove</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a> cut down her <a href="../ebd/ebd186.htm#006">idol</a>, and stamped it, and burnt it at the <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#006">brook</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd218.htm#008">Kidron</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> But the high places were not taken away out of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: nevertheless the heart of <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a> was perfect all his days.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, and vessels.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a>.<br>
