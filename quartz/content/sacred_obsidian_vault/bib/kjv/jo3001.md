 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 3 John Chapter 1</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd114.htm#008">elder</a> unto the well beloved <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#003">Gaius</a>, whom I love in the truth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Which have borne <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> of thy <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#009">charity</a> before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</a> after a godly sort, thou shalt do well:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing of the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> I wrote unto the church: but <a href="../ebd/ebd104.htm#002">Diotrephes</a>, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd101.htm#005">Demetrius</a> hath good report of all men, and of the truth itself: yea, and we also bear record; and ye know that our record is true.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name.<br>
 </p>
