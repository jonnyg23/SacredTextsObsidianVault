 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 24</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And it came to pass, when <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> was returned from following the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>, that it was told him, saying, Behold, <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> is in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd120.htm#009">Engedi</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> took three thousand <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> men out of all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and went to seek <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#006">cave</a>; and <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> went in to cover his feet: and <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> and his men remained in the sides of the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#006">cave</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> said unto him, Behold the day of which the LORD said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee. Then <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privily.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And he said unto his men, The LORD forbid that I should do this thing unto my master, the LORD's anointed, to stretch forth mine hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> stayed his servants with these words, and suffered them not to rise against <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>. But <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> rose up out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#006">cave</a>, and went on his way.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> also arose afterward, and went out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#006">cave</a>, and cried after <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, saying, My lord the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>. And when <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> looked behind him, <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> said to <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, Wherefore hearest thou men's words, saying, Behold, <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> seeketh thy hurt?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the LORD had delivered thee to day into mine hand in the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#006">cave</a>: and some bade me kill thee: but mine eye spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth mine hand against my lord; for he is the LORD's anointed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in mine hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> The LORD <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> between me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of thee: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> As saith the <a href="../ebd/ebd301.htm#002">proverb</a> of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> After whom is the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#005">flea</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> The LORD therefore be <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thine hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And it came to pass, when <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> had made an end of speaking these words unto <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, that <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> said, Is this thy voice, my son <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>? And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> lifted up his voice, and wept.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And he said to <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, Thou art more righteous than I: for thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me: forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me into thine hand, thou killedst me not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore the LORD reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, and that the kingdom of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> shall be established in thine hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father's house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> sware unto <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>. And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> went home; but <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> and his men gat them up unto the hold.<br>
