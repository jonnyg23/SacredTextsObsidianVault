 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Hosea Chapter 7</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> When I would have healed <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, then the iniquity of <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a> was discovered, and the wickedness of <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a>: for they commit falsehood; and the thief cometh in, and the troop of robbers spoileth without.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness: now their own doings have beset them about; they are before my face.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> They make the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> They are all adulterers, as an <a href="../ebd/ebd281.htm#005">oven</a> heated by the baker, who ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the <a href="../ebd/ebd106.htm#006">dough</a>, until it be leavened.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> In the day of our <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> the princes have made him sick with bottles of <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>; he stretched out his hand with scorners.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> For they have made ready their heart like an <a href="../ebd/ebd281.htm#005">oven</a>, whiles they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> They are all hot as an <a href="../ebd/ebd281.htm#005">oven</a>, and have devoured their judges; all their kings are fallen: there is none among them that calleth unto me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a>, he hath mixed himself among the people; <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a> is a <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#009">cake</a> not turned.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not: yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And the pride of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> testifieth to his face: and they do not return to the LORD their God, nor seek him for all this.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a> also is like a silly <a href="../ebd/ebd106.htm#007">dove</a> without heart: they call to <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, they go to <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> When they shall go, I will spread my <a href="../ebd/ebd271.htm#002">net</a> upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>; I will chastise them, as their <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a> hath heard.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a> unto them! because they have transgressed against me: though I have redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds: they assemble themselves for <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>, and they rebel against me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Though I have bound and strengthened their arms, yet do they imagine mischief against me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> They return, but not to the most High: they are like a deceitful <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a>: their princes shall fall by the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> for the rage of their tongue: this shall be their derision in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>.<br>
