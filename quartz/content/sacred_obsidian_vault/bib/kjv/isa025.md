 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 25</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> O Lord, thou art my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy name; for thou hast done wonderful things; thy counsels of old are faithfulness and truth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> For thou hast made of a city an <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</a>; of a defenced city a ruin: a <a href="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</a> of strangers to be no city; it shall never be built.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Therefore shall the strong people <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#005">glorify</a> thee, the city of the terrible nations shall fear thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> For thou hast been a strength to the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>, a strength to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</a> from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a dry place; even the heat with the <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</a> of a <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a>: the <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#002">branch</a> of the terrible ones shall be brought low.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make unto all people a <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</a> things, a <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a> of wines on the <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#005">lees</a>, of <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</a> things full of marrow, of wines on the <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#005">lees</a> well refined.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people, and the vail that is spread over all nations.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> He will <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#009">swallow</a> up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth: for the LORD hath spoken it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the LORD; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest, and <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a> shall be trodden down under him, even as <a href="../ebd/ebd352.htm#000">straw</a> is trodden down for the dunghill.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth his hands to swim: and he shall bring down their pride together with the spoils of their hands.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And the fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall he bring down, lay low, and bring to the ground, even to the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a>.<br>
