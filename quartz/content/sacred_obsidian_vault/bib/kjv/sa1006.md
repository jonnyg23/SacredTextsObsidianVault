 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 6</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of the LORD was in the country of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> months.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do to the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of the LORD? tell us wherewith we shall send it to his place.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And they said, If ye send away the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, send it not empty; but in any <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> return him a trespass <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a>: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Then said they, What shall be the trespass <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> which we shall return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>: for one <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#001">plague</a> was on you all, and on your lords.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> unto the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Now therefore make a new <a href="../ebd/ebd073.htm#001">cart</a>, and take two milch <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#000">kine</a>, on which there hath come no <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</a>, and tie the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#000">kine</a> to the <a href="../ebd/ebd073.htm#001">cart</a>, and bring their calves home from them:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And take the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of the LORD, and lay it upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd073.htm#001">cart</a>; and put the jewels of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, which ye return him for a trespass <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a>, in a <a href="../ebd/ebd086.htm#000">coffer</a> by the side thereof; and send it away, that it may go.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to Bethshemesh, then he hath done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us: it was a chance that happened to us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And the men did so; and took two milch <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#000">kine</a>, and tied them to the <a href="../ebd/ebd073.htm#001">cart</a>, and shut up their calves at home:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And they laid the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of the LORD upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd073.htm#001">cart</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd086.htm#000">coffer</a> with the mice of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> and the images of their emerods.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#000">kine</a> took the straight way to the way of Bethshemesh, and went along the <a href="../ebd/ebd178.htm#005">highway</a>, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> went after them unto the border of Bethshemesh.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And they of Bethshemesh were reaping their <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#000">wheat</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd165.htm#008">harvest</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a>: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a>, and rejoiced to see it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd073.htm#001">cart</a> came into the field of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a>, a Bethshemite, and stood there, where there was a great <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a>: and they clave the <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd073.htm#001">cart</a>, and offered the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#000">kine</a> a burnt <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> unto the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And the Levites took down the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of the LORD, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd086.htm#000">coffer</a> that was with it, wherein the jewels of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> were, and put them on the great <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a>: and the men of Bethshemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And when the five lords of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> had seen it, they returned to <a href="../ebd/ebd114.htm#001">Ekron</a> the same day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And these are the golden emerods which the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> returned for a trespass <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> unto the LORD; for <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#006">Ashdod</a> one, for <a href="../ebd/ebd144.htm#003">Gaza</a> one, for Askelon one, for <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#009">Gath</a> one, for <a href="../ebd/ebd114.htm#001">Ekron</a> one;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> belonging to the five lords, both of fenced cities, and of country <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#003">villages</a>, even unto the great <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd001.htm#004">Abel</a>, whereon they set down the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of the LORD: which <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> remaineth unto this day in the field of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a>, the Bethshemite.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked into the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of the LORD, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men: and the people lamented, because the LORD had smitten many of the people with a great slaughter.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy LORD God? and to whom shall he go up from us?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim, saying, The <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> have brought again the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of the LORD; come ye down, and fetch it up to you.<br>
