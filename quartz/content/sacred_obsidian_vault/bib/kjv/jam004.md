 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: James Chapter 4</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Ye <a href="../ebd/ebd233.htm#005">lust</a>, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is <a href="../ebd/ebd121.htm#003">enmity</a> with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Do ye think that the <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#005">scripture</a> saith in vain, The <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> But he giveth more <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a>. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> unto the humble.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</a>, and he will flee from you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Be afflicted, and <a href="../ebd/ebd261.htm#004">mourn</a>, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>.<br>
