 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 44</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Yet now hear, O <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> my servant; and <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, whom I have <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Thus saith the LORD that made thee, and formed thee from the womb, which will help thee; Fear not, O <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, my servant; and thou, Jesurun, whom I have <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour my <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And they shall spring up as among the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</a>, as <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#006">willows</a> by the water <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#006">courses</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> One shall say, I am the LORD's; and another shall call himself by the name of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>; and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the LORD, and surname himself by the name of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Thus saith the LORD the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and his <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#008">redeemer</a> the LORD of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in order for me, since I appointed the ancient people? and the things that are coming, and shall come, let them shew unto them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told thee from that time, and have declared it? ye are even my witnesses. Is there a God beside me? yea, there is no God; I know not any.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> They that make a graven image are all of them vanity; and their delectable things shall not profit; and they are their own witnesses; they see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Who hath formed a god, or molten a graven image that is profitable for nothing?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Behold, all his fellows shall be ashamed: and the workmen, they are of men: let them all be gathered together, let them stand up; yet they shall fear, and they shall be ashamed together.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd346.htm#006">smith</a> with the tongs both worketh in the coals, and fashioneth it with hammers, and worketh it with the strength of his arms: yea, he is hungry, and his strength faileth: he drinketh no water, and is faint.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#009">carpenter</a> stretcheth out his rule; he marketh it out with a line; he fitteth it with planes, and he marketh it out with the compass, and maketh it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man; that it may remain in the house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> He heweth him down cedars, and taketh the <a href="../ebd/ebd095.htm#002">cypress</a> and the <a href="../ebd/ebd275.htm#009">oak</a>, which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#006">forest</a>: he planteth an <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#005">ash</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a> doth nourish it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Then shall it be for a man to burn: for he will take thereof, and warm himself; yea, he kindleth it, and baketh <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>; yea, he maketh a god, and worshippeth it; he maketh it a graven image, and falleth down thereto.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> He burneth part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he eateth <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>; he roasteth roast, and is satisfied: yea, he warmeth himself, and saith, <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#001">Aha</a>, I am warm, I have seen the fire:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And the residue thereof he maketh a god, even his graven image: he falleth down unto it, and worshippeth it, and prayeth unto it, and saith, Deliver me; for thou art my god.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> They have not known nor understood: for he hath shut their eyes, that they cannot see; and their hearts, that they cannot understand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And none considereth in his heart, neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire; yea, also I have baked <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> upon the coals thereof; I have roasted <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, and eaten it: and shall I make the residue thereof an <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</a>? shall I fall down to the stock of a tree?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> He feedeth on <a href="../ebd/ebd034.htm#000">ashes</a>: a deceived heart hath turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Remember these, O <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; for thou art my servant: I have formed thee; thou art my servant: O <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, thou shalt not be forgotten of me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> I have blotted out, as a thick <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a>, thy transgressions, and, as a <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a>, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Sing, O ye heavens; for the LORD hath done it: shout, ye lower parts of the earth: break forth into singing, ye mountains, O <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#006">forest</a>, and every tree therein: for the LORD hath redeemed <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, and glorified himself in <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Thus saith the LORD, thy <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#008">redeemer</a>, and he that formed thee from the womb, I am the LORD that maketh all things; that stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> That frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners mad; that turneth <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> men backward, and maketh their knowledge foolish;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> That confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth the counsel of his messengers; that saith to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, Thou shalt be inhabited; and to the cities of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, Ye shall be built, and I will raise up the decayed places thereof:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> That saith to the <a href="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</a>, Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> That saith of <a href="../ebd/ebd095.htm#006">Cyrus</a>, He is my <a href="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</a>, and shall perform all my pleasure: even saying to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, Thou shalt be built; and to the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>, Thy foundation shall be laid.<br>
