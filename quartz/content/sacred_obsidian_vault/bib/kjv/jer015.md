 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 15</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then said the LORD unto me, Though <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> stood before me, yet my mind could not be toward this people: cast them out of my sight, and let them go forth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And it shall come to pass, if they say unto thee, Whither shall we go forth? then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith the LORD; Such as are for death, to death; and such as are for the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, to the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>; and such as are for the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a>, to the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a>; and such as are for the <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a>, to the <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith the LORD: the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> to slay, and the dogs to tear, and the fowls of the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and destroy.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth, because of <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, for that which he did in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> For who shall have pity upon thee, O <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>? or who shall bemoan thee? or who shall go aside to ask how thou doest?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Thou hast forsaken me, saith the LORD, thou art gone backward: therefore will I stretch out my hand against thee, and destroy thee; I am weary with repenting.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And I will <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#001">fan</a> them with a <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#001">fan</a> in the gates of the land; I will bereave them of children, I will destroy my people since they return not from their ways.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Their <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#003">widows</a> are increased to me above the sand of the seas: I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noonday: I have caused him to fall upon it suddenly, and terrors upon the city.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> She that hath borne <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> languisheth: she hath given up the <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">ghost</a>; her <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> is gone down while it was yet day: she hath been ashamed and confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver to the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> before their enemies, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither lent on <a href="../ebd/ebd375.htm#006">usury</a>, nor men have lent to me on <a href="../ebd/ebd375.htm#006">usury</a>; yet every one of them doth <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</a> me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> The LORD said, Verily it shall be well with thy remnant; verily I will cause the enemy to entreat thee well in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Shall <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a> break the northern <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a> and the <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#000">steel</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Thy substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil without price, and that for all thy sins, even in all thy borders.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And I will make thee to pass with thine enemies into a land which thou knowest not: for a fire is kindled in mine <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>, which shall burn upon you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> O LORD, thou knowest: remember me, and visit me, and revenge me of my persecutors; take me not away in thy longsuffering: know that for thy sake I have suffered rebuke.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O LORD God of hosts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of thy hand: for thou hast filled me with indignation.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuseth to be healed? wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar, and as waters that fail?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Therefore thus saith the LORD, If thou return, then will I bring thee again, and thou shalt stand before me: and if thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth: let them return unto thee; but return not thou unto them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And I will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall: and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee: for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible.<br>
