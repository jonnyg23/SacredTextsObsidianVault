 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Matthew Chapter 4</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then was <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> led up of the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> into the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> to be tempted of the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Then the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</a> taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#009">pinnacle</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Again, the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</a> taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of them;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Then saith <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> unto him, Get thee hence, <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</a>: for it is written, Thou shalt <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Then the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</a> leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Now when <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> had heard that John was cast into <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a>, he departed into <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And leaving <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#007">Nazareth</a>, he came and dwelt in <a href="../ebd/ebd071.htm#007">Capernaum</a>, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of <a href="../ebd/ebd386.htm#001">Zabulon</a> and Nephthalim:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#003">Esaias</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> The land of <a href="../ebd/ebd386.htm#001">Zabulon</a>, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> The people which sat in <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a> saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</a> of death light is sprung up.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> From that time <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> is at hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, walking by the sea of <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a>, saw two brethren, <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a> called <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd023.htm#007">Andrew</a> his brother, casting a <a href="../ebd/ebd271.htm#002">net</a> into the sea: for they were fishers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And they straightway left their nets, and followed him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, <a href="../ebd/ebd196.htm#007">James</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd388.htm#008">Zebedee</a>, and John his brother, in a ship with <a href="../ebd/ebd388.htm#008">Zebedee</a> their father, mending their nets; and he called them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> went about all <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a>, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a> of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And his fame went throughout all <a href="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</a>: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatick, and those that had the <a href="../ebd/ebd283.htm#004">palsy</a>; and he healed them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And there followed him great multitudes of people from <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a>, and from <a href="../ebd/ebd100.htm#002">Decapolis</a>, and from <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and from Judaea, and from beyond <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a>.<br>
