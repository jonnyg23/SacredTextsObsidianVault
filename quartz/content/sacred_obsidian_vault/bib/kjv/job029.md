 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 29</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Moreover Job continued his <a href="../ebd/ebd284.htm#003">parable</a>, and said,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when God preserved me;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> When his <a href="../ebd/ebd071.htm#000">candle</a> shined upon my head, and when by his light I walked through <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God was upon my <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> When the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were about me;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> When I washed my steps with <a href="../ebd/ebd067.htm#002">butter</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a> poured me out rivers of oil;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> When I went out to the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> through the city, when I prepared my seat in the street!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, and stood up.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their mouth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> When the <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a> heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> to me:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Because I delivered the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> I put on <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>, and it clothed me: my judgment was as a robe and a <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#009">diadem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> I was eyes to the <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a>, and feet was I to the lame.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> I was a father to the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>: and the cause which I knew not I searched out.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> My root was spread out by the waters, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#008">dew</a> lay all night upon my <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#002">branch</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> My <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> was fresh in me, and my <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a> was renewed in my hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Unto me men gave <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a>, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And they waited for me as for the <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a>; and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> in the army, as one that comforteth the mourners.<br>
