 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Psalms Chapter 35</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Plead my cause, O LORD, with them that strive with me: fight against them that fight against me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Take hold of <a href="../ebd/ebd337.htm#001">shield</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#000">buckler</a>, and stand up for mine help.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Draw out also the spear, and stop the way against them that persecute me: say unto my soul, I am thy <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul: let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Let them be as <a href="../ebd/ebd075.htm#007">chaff</a> before the wind: and let the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the LORD chase them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the LORD persecute them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> For without cause have they hid for me their <a href="../ebd/ebd271.htm#002">net</a> in a <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a>, which without cause they have digged for my soul.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Let <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a> come upon him at unawares; and let his <a href="../ebd/ebd271.htm#002">net</a> that he hath hid catch himself: into that very <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a> let him fall.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD: it shall rejoice in his <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> All my bones shall say, LORD, who is like unto thee, which deliverest the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> from him that is too strong for him, yea, the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> and the needy from him that spoileth him?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge things that I knew not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> They rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#001">sackcloth</a>: I humbled my soul with fasting; and my <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a> returned into mine own <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#008">bosom</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother: I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth for his mother.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: yea, the <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#000">abjects</a> gathered themselves together against me, and I knew it not; they did tear me, and ceased not:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their teeth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their destructions, my <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#000">darling</a> from the <a href="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> I will give thee thanks in the great <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a>: I will praise thee among much people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters against them that are quiet in the land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, and said, <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#001">Aha</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#001">aha</a>, our eye hath seen it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> This thou hast seen, O LORD: keep not silence: O Lord, be not far from me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, even unto my cause, my God and my Lord.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">Judge</a> me, O LORD my God, according to thy <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>; and let them not rejoice over me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let them not say, We have swallowed him up.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify themselves against me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the LORD be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And my tongue shall speak of thy <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> and of thy praise all the day long.<br>
