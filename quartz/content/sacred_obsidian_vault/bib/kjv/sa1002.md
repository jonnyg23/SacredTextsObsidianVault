 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 2</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd163.htm#002">Hannah</a> prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, mine <a href="../ebd/ebd182.htm#003">horn</a> is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside thee: neither is there any <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a> like our God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> They that were full have hired out themselves for <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>; and they that were hungry ceased: so that the <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#007">barren</a> hath born <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a>; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</a>, and bringeth up.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> The LORD maketh <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> He raiseth up the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a>, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>: for the pillars of the earth are the LORD's, and he hath set the world upon them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>; for by strength shall no man prevail.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a>; out of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> shall he <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#003">thunder</a> upon them: the LORD shall <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, and exalt the <a href="../ebd/ebd182.htm#003">horn</a> of his anointed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd118.htm#005">Elkanah</a> went to <a href="../ebd/ebd306.htm#005">Ramah</a> to his house. And the child did <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</a> unto the LORD before <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Now the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</a> were sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd051.htm#007">Belial</a>; they knew not the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And the priest's <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#008">custom</a> with the people was, that, when any man offered <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a>, the priest's servant came, while the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And he struck it into the <a href="../ebd/ebd283.htm#009">pan</a>, or <a href="../ebd/ebd218.htm#000">kettle</a>, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> took for himself. So they did in <a href="../ebd/ebd337.htm#008">Shiloh</a> unto all the Israelites that came thither.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Also before they burnt the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</a>, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> to roast for the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>; for he will not have sodden <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> of thee, but raw.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</a> presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, Nay; but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Wherefore the <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a <a href="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd122.htm#008">ephod</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Moreover his mother made him a little <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#004">coat</a>, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</a> blessed <a href="../ebd/ebd118.htm#005">Elkanah</a> and his wife, and said, The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the <a href="../ebd/ebd230.htm#008">loan</a> which is lent to the LORD. And they went unto their own home.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And the LORD visited <a href="../ebd/ebd163.htm#002">Hannah</a>, so that she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> grew before the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Now <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</a> was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make the LORD's people to transgress.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> If one man <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> against another, the <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> shall <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> him: but if a man <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> against the LORD, who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And the child <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> grew on, and was in favour both with the LORD, and also with men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And there came a man of God unto <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</a>, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> in Pharaoh's house?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And did I choose him out of all the tribes of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> to be my <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, to offer upon mine <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a>, to burn <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a>, to wear an <a href="../ebd/ebd122.htm#008">ephod</a> before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Wherefore kick ye at my <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> and at mine <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a>, which I have commanded in my <a href="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</a>; and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</a> with the chiefest of all the offerings of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> my people?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Wherefore the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And thou shalt see an enemy in my <a href="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</a>, in all the wealth which God shall give <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a>, shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on <a href="../ebd/ebd181.htm#006">Hophni</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#003">Phinehas</a>; in one day they shall die both of them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And I will raise me up a <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thine house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> and a morsel of <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a piece of <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>.<br>
