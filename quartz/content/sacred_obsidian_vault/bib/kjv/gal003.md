 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Galatians Chapter 3</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> This only would I learn of you, Received ye the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Are ye so foolish? having begun in the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a>, are ye now made perfect by the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> He therefore that ministereth to you the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a>, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Even as <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> believed God, and it was accounted to him for <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#005">scripture</a>, foreseeing that God would justify the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a> through faith, preached before the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> So then they which be of faith are blessed with <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> For as many as are of the works of the law are under the <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</a>: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> hath redeemed us from the <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</a> of the law, being made a <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</a> for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> That the blessing of <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> might come on the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a> through <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>; that we might receive the promise of the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> through faith.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man's <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a>, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Now to <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And this I say, that the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a>, that was confirmed before of God in <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> by promise.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a <a href="../ebd/ebd246.htm#002">mediator</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Now a <a href="../ebd/ebd246.htm#002">mediator</a> is not a <a href="../ebd/ebd246.htm#002">mediator</a> of one, but God is one.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> should have been by the law.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> But the <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#005">scripture</a> hath concluded all under <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>, that the promise by faith of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> might be given to them that believe.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Wherefore the law was our <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#009">schoolmaster</a> to bring us unto <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, that we might be justified by faith.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#009">schoolmaster</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> For ye are all the children of God by faith in <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> For as many of you as have been baptized into <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> have put on <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> There is neither <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#004">Jew</a> nor <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#004">Greek</a>, there is neither <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#001">bond</a> nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.<br>
