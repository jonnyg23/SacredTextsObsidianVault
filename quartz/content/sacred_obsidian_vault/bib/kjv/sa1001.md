 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 1</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a>, and his name was <a href="../ebd/ebd118.htm#005">Elkanah</a>, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#001">Jeroham</a>, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#008">Elihu</a>, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd369.htm#005">Tohu</a>, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd396.htm#003">Zuph</a>, an <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#007">Ephrathite</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And he had two wives; the name of the one was <a href="../ebd/ebd163.htm#002">Hannah</a>, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but <a href="../ebd/ebd163.htm#002">Hannah</a> had no children.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And this man went up out of his city yearly to <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> and to <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> unto the LORD of hosts in <a href="../ebd/ebd337.htm#008">Shiloh</a>. And the two sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd181.htm#006">Hophni</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#003">Phinehas</a>, the priests of the LORD, were there.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And when the time was that <a href="../ebd/ebd118.htm#005">Elkanah</a> offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> But unto <a href="../ebd/ebd163.htm#002">Hannah</a> he gave a worthy portion; for he loved <a href="../ebd/ebd163.htm#002">Hannah</a>: but the LORD had shut up her womb.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And her <a href="../ebd/ebd011.htm#001">adversary</a> also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd118.htm#005">Elkanah</a> her husband to her, <a href="../ebd/ebd163.htm#002">Hannah</a>, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd163.htm#002">Hannah</a> rose up after they had eaten in <a href="../ebd/ebd337.htm#008">Shiloh</a>, and after they had <a href="../ebd/ebd108.htm#007">drunk</a>. Now <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> sat upon a seat by a <a href="../ebd/ebd299.htm#001">post</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and wept sore.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine <a href="../ebd/ebd162.htm#008">handmaid</a>, and remember me, and not forget thine <a href="../ebd/ebd162.htm#008">handmaid</a>, but wilt give unto thine <a href="../ebd/ebd162.htm#008">handmaid</a> a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no <a href="../ebd/ebd307.htm#009">razor</a> come upon his head.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</a> marked her mouth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Now <a href="../ebd/ebd163.htm#002">Hannah</a>, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</a> thought she had been drunken.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</a> said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> from thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd163.htm#002">Hannah</a> answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>: I have <a href="../ebd/ebd108.htm#007">drunk</a> neither <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> nor strong <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>, but have poured out my soul before the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Count not thine <a href="../ebd/ebd162.htm#008">handmaid</a> for a daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd051.htm#007">Belial</a>: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</a> answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And she said, Let thine <a href="../ebd/ebd162.htm#008">handmaid</a> find <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to <a href="../ebd/ebd306.htm#005">Ramah</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd118.htm#005">Elkanah</a> knew <a href="../ebd/ebd163.htm#002">Hannah</a> his wife; and the LORD remembered her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after <a href="../ebd/ebd163.htm#002">Hannah</a> had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a>, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And the man <a href="../ebd/ebd118.htm#005">Elkanah</a>, and all his house, went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a>, and his vow.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd163.htm#002">Hannah</a> went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd118.htm#005">Elkanah</a> her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one <a href="../ebd/ebd122.htm#003">ephah</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#001">flour</a>, and a <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#002">bottle</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>, and brought him unto the house of the LORD in <a href="../ebd/ebd337.htm#008">Shiloh</a>: and the child was young.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And they slew a <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#003">bullock</a>, and brought the child to <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD there.<br>
