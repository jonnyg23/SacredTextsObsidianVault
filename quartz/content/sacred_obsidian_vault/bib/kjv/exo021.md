 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Exodus Chapter 21</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> If thou buy an <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#009">Hebrew</a> servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were married, then his wife shall go out with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or unto the door <a href="../ebd/ebd299.htm#001">post</a>; and his master shall bore his <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a> through with an aul; and he shall serve him for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out free without money.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a>, that he may die.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And if men strive together, and one smite another with a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a>, or with his fist, and he die not, but keepeth his bed:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> If he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall be surely punished.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he is his money.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, that it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye's sake.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And if he smite out his manservant's tooth, or his maidservant's tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> If an <a href="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</a> gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the <a href="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</a> shall be surely stoned, and his <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> shall not be eaten; but the owner of the <a href="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</a> shall be quit.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> But if the <a href="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</a> were wont to push with his <a href="../ebd/ebd182.htm#003">horn</a> in time past, and it hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, but that he hath killed a man or a woman; the <a href="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</a> shall be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the <a href="../ebd/ebd307.htm#005">ransom</a> of his life whatsoever is laid upon him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done unto him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> If the <a href="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</a> shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</a> shall be stoned.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And if a man shall open a <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a>, or if a man shall dig a <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a>, and not cover it, and an <a href="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</a> or an <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</a> fall therein;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> The owner of the <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a> shall make it good, and give money unto the owner of them; and the dead <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> shall be his.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And if one man's <a href="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</a> hurt another's, that he die; then they shall sell the live <a href="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</a>, and divide the money of it; and the dead <a href="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</a> also they shall divide.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> Or if it be known that the <a href="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</a> hath used to push in time past, and his owner hath not kept him in; he shall surely pay <a href="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</a> for <a href="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</a>; and the dead shall be his own.<br>
