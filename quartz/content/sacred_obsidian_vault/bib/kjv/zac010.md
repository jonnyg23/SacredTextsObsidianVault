 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Zechariah Chapter 10</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Ask ye of the LORD <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a> in the time of the latter <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a>; so the LORD shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a>, to every one <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</a> in the field.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie, and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain: therefore they went their way as a flock, they were troubled, because there was no <a href="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Mine <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> was kindled against the shepherds, and I punished the goats: for the LORD of hosts hath visited his flock the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and hath made them as his goodly horse in the battle.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#000">nail</a>, out of him the battle <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a>, out of him every oppressor together.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And they shall be as mighty men, which tread down their enemies in the mire of the streets in the battle: and they shall fight, because the LORD is with them, and the riders on horses shall be confounded.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And I will strengthen the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and I will save the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>, and I will bring them again to place them; for I have <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> upon them: and they shall be as though I had not cast them off: for I am the LORD their God, and will hear them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And they of <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a> shall be like a mighty man, and their heart shall rejoice as through <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>: yea, their children shall see it, and be glad; their heart shall rejoice in the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> I will <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#005">hiss</a> for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them: and they shall increase as they have increased.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And I will sow them among the people: and they shall remember me in far countries; and they shall live with their children, and turn again.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> I will bring them again also out of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and gather them out of <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</a>; and I will bring them into the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#009">Gilead</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</a>; and place shall not be found for them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And he shall pass through the sea with affliction, and shall smite the waves in the sea, and all the deeps of the river shall dry up: and the pride of <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</a> shall be brought down, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#006">sceptre</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> shall depart away.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And I will strengthen them in the LORD; and they shall walk up and down in his name, saith the LORD.<br>
