 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Deuteronomy Chapter 2</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then we turned, and took our <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</a> into the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we compassed <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd326.htm#004">Seir</a> many days.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And the LORD spake unto me, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you <a href="../ebd/ebd275.htm#002">northward</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</a>, which dwell in <a href="../ebd/ebd326.htm#004">Seir</a>; and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd326.htm#004">Seir</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</a> for a possession.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>: these forty years the LORD thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And when we passed by from our brethren the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</a>, which dwelt in <a href="../ebd/ebd326.htm#004">Seir</a>, through the way of the <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</a> from <a href="../ebd/ebd114.htm#005">Elath</a>, and from Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd119.htm#009">Emims</a> dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Which also were accounted <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#006">giants</a>, as the Anakims; but the Moabites called them <a href="../ebd/ebd119.htm#009">Emims</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> The Horims also dwelt in <a href="../ebd/ebd326.htm#004">Seir</a> beforetime; but the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</a> succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> did unto the land of his possession, which the LORD gave unto them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Now rise up, said I, and get you over the <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#006">brook</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd391.htm#002">Zered</a>. And we went over the <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#006">brook</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd391.htm#002">Zered</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were come over the <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#006">brook</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd391.htm#002">Zered</a>, was thirty and eight years; until all the <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a> of the men of war were wasted out from among the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a>, as the LORD sware unto them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from among the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a>, until they were consumed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> That the LORD spake unto me, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>, this day:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And when thou comest nigh over against the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a>, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of the land of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a> any possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> (That also was accounted a land of <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#006">giants</a>: <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#006">giants</a> dwelt therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them <a href="../ebd/ebd387.htm#003">Zamzummims</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> As he did to the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</a>, which dwelt in <a href="../ebd/ebd326.htm#004">Seir</a>, when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And the Avims which dwelt in <a href="../ebd/ebd169.htm#002">Hazerim</a>, even unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of <a href="../ebd/ebd071.htm#008">Caphtor</a>, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Rise ye up, take your <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</a>, and pass over the river <a href="../ebd/ebd032.htm#000">Arnon</a>: behold, I have given into thine hand <a href="../ebd/ebd343.htm#002">Sihon</a> the Amorite, <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd176.htm#009">Heshbon</a>, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations that are under the whole <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And I sent messengers out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd216.htm#005">Kedemoth</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd343.htm#002">Sihon</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd176.htm#009">Heshbon</a> with words of peace, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>: only I will pass through on my feet;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> (As the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</a> which dwell in <a href="../ebd/ebd326.htm#004">Seir</a>, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a> into the land which the LORD our God giveth us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd343.htm#002">Sihon</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd176.htm#009">Heshbon</a> would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy God hardened his <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give <a href="../ebd/ebd343.htm#002">Sihon</a> and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd343.htm#002">Sihon</a> came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at <a href="../ebd/ebd195.htm#005">Jahaz</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> Only the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a> we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> From <a href="../ebd/ebd032.htm#001">Aroer</a>, which is by the brink of the river of <a href="../ebd/ebd032.htm#000">Arnon</a>, and from the city that is by the river, even unto <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#009">Gilead</a>, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> Only unto the land of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a> thou camest not, nor unto any place of the river <a href="../ebd/ebd193.htm#006">Jabbok</a>, nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us.<br>
