 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 1</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river of <a href="../ebd/ebd078.htm#002">Chebar</a>, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> Jehoiachin's <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> The word of the LORD came expressly unto <a href="../ebd/ebd129.htm#001">Ezekiel</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd067.htm#004">Buzi</a>, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river <a href="../ebd/ebd078.htm#002">Chebar</a>; and the hand of the LORD was there upon him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a>, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the <a href="../ebd/ebd086.htm#008">colour</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd019.htm#009">amber</a>, out of the midst of the fire.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot: and they sparkled like the <a href="../ebd/ebd086.htm#008">colour</a> of burnished <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an <a href="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</a> on the left side; they four also had the face of an <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#003">eagle</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And they went every one straight forward: whither the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth <a href="../ebd/ebd229.htm#002">lightning</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of <a href="../ebd/ebd229.htm#002">lightning</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#001">wheel</a> upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd086.htm#008">colour</a> of a <a href="../ebd/ebd053.htm#008">beryl</a>: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were a <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#001">wheel</a> in the middle of a <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#001">wheel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> When they went, they went upon their four sides: and they turned not when they went.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Whithersoever the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> was to go, they went, thither was their <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> of the living <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#004">creature</a> was in the wheels.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> of the living <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#004">creature</a> was in the wheels.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And the likeness of the <a href="../ebd/ebd134.htm#000">firmament</a> upon the heads of the living <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#004">creature</a> was as the <a href="../ebd/ebd086.htm#008">colour</a> of the terrible <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#005">crystal</a>, stretched forth over their heads above.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And under the <a href="../ebd/ebd134.htm#000">firmament</a> were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a>: when they stood, they let down their wings.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And there was a voice from the <a href="../ebd/ebd134.htm#000">firmament</a> that was over their heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And above the <a href="../ebd/ebd134.htm#000">firmament</a> that was over their heads was the likeness of a <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a>, as the appearance of a <a href="../ebd/ebd322.htm#002">sapphire</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a>: and upon the likeness of the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And I saw as the <a href="../ebd/ebd086.htm#008">colour</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd019.htm#009">amber</a>, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> As the appearance of the <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a> that is in the <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a> in the day of <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a>, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.<br>
