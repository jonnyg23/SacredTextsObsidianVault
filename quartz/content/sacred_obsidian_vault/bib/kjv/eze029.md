 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 29</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> In the tenth year, in the tenth month, in the twelfth day of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Son of man, set thy face against <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and prophesy against him, and against all <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Speak, and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, the great <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#000">dragon</a> that lieth in the midst of his rivers, which hath said, My river is mine own, and I have made it for myself.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> But I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the <a href="../ebd/ebd134.htm#005">fish</a> of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales, and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers, and all the <a href="../ebd/ebd134.htm#005">fish</a> of thy rivers shall stick unto thy scales.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And I will leave thee thrown into the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, thee and all the <a href="../ebd/ebd134.htm#005">fish</a> of thy rivers: thou shalt fall upon the open fields; thou shalt not be brought together, nor gathered: I have given thee for meat to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And all the inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> shall know that I am the LORD, because they have been a staff of <a href="../ebd/ebd309.htm#000">reed</a> to the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> When they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou didst break, and rend all their shoulder: and when they leaned upon thee, thou brakest, and madest all their loins to be at a stand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring a <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> upon thee, and cut off man and <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> out of thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> shall be desolate and waste; and they shall know that I am the LORD: because he hath said, The river is mine, and I have made it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Behold, therefore I am against thee, and against thy rivers, and I will make the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> utterly waste and desolate, from the tower of <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#008">Syene</a> even unto the border of <a href="../ebd/ebd126.htm#005">Ethiopia</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And I will make the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate, and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be desolate forty years: and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Yet thus saith the Lord GOD; At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the people whither they were scattered:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And I will bring again the <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and will cause them to return into the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#007">Pathros</a>, into the land of their <a href="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</a>; and they shall be there a base kingdom.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> It shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations: for I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the nations.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, which bringeth their iniquity to remembrance, when they shall look after them: but they shall know that I am the Lord GOD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And it came to pass in the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> and twentieth year, in the first month, in the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Son of man, <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#006">Nebuchadrezzar</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> caused his army to serve a great service against Tyrus: every head was made bald, and every shoulder was peeled: yet had he no <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#004">wages</a>, nor his army, for Tyrus, for the service that he had served against it:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will give the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#006">Nebuchadrezzar</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>; and he shall take her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#004">wages</a> for his army.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> I have given him the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> for his labour wherewith he served against it, because they wrought for me, saith the Lord GOD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> In that day will I cause the <a href="../ebd/ebd182.htm#003">horn</a> of the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> to bud forth, and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.<br>
