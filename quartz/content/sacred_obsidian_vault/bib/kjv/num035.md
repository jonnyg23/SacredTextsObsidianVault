 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Numbers Chapter 35</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And the LORD spake unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> in the plains of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a> by <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a> near <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#008">Jericho</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Command the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, that they give unto the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and ye shall give also unto the Levites <a href="../ebd/ebd352.htm#007">suburbs</a> for the cities round about them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And the cities shall they have to dwell in; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd352.htm#007">suburbs</a> of them shall be for their <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a>, and for their goods, and for all their beasts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd352.htm#007">suburbs</a> of the cities, which ye shall give unto the Levites, shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And ye shall measure from without the city on the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a> side two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits; and the city shall be in the midst: this shall be to them the <a href="../ebd/ebd352.htm#007">suburbs</a> of the cities.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And among the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites there shall be six cities for refuge, which ye shall appoint for the <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#008">manslayer</a>, that he may flee thither: and to them ye shall add forty and two cities.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> So all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be forty and eight cities: them shall ye give with their <a href="../ebd/ebd352.htm#007">suburbs</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And the cities which ye shall give shall be of the possession of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: from them that have many ye shall give many; but from them that have few ye shall give few: every one shall give of his cities unto the Levites according to his inheritance which he inheriteth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And the LORD spake unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Speak unto the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and say unto them, When ye be come over <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a> into the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you; that the slayer may flee thither, which killeth any person at unawares.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger; that the <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#008">manslayer</a> die not, until he stand before the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a> in judgment.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And of these cities which ye shall give six cities shall ye have for refuge.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Ye shall give three cities on this side <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a>, and three cities shall ye give in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</a>, which shall be cities of refuge.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> These six cities shall be a refuge, both for the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and for the <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a>, and for the sojourner among them: that every one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And if he smite him with an instrument of <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a>, so that he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And if he smite him with throwing a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a>, wherewith he may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Or if he smite him with an hand weapon of <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a>, wherewith he may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> The revenger of <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> himself shall slay the murderer: when he meeteth him, he shall slay him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> But if he thrust him of <a href="../ebd/ebd167.htm#002">hatred</a>, or hurl at him by laying of wait, that he die;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Or in <a href="../ebd/ebd121.htm#003">enmity</a> smite him with his hand, that he die: he that smote him shall surely be put to death; for he is a murderer: the revenger of <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> shall slay the murderer, when he meeteth him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> But if he thrust him suddenly without <a href="../ebd/ebd121.htm#003">enmity</a>, or have cast upon him any thing without laying of wait,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Or with any <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a>, wherewith a man may die, seeing him not, and cast it upon him, that he die, and was not his enemy, neither sought his harm:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Then the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a> shall <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> between the slayer and the revenger of <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> according to these judgments:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a> shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a> shall restore him to the city of his refuge, whither he was fled: and he shall abide in it unto the death of the high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, which was anointed with the holy oil.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the city of his refuge, whither he was fled;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And the revenger of <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> find him without the borders of the city of his refuge, and the revenger of <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> kill the slayer; he shall not be guilty of <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>: but after the death of the high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> the slayer shall return into the land of his possession.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> So these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto you throughout your generations in all your <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#001">dwellings</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses: but one <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> shall not testify against any person to cause him to die.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, which is guilty of death: but he shall be surely put to death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are: for <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> it defileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> that is shed therein, but by the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of him that shed it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> Defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit, wherein I dwell: for I the LORD dwell among the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
