 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 24</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed thereof.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> They drive away the <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</a> of the fatherless, they take the widow's <a href="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</a> for a <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#005">pledge</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> They turn the needy out of the way: the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> of the earth hide themselves together.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Behold, as wild asses in the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#000">desert</a>, go they forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> yieldeth food for them and for their children.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> They reap every one his <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</a> in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> They cause the <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd231.htm#002">lodge</a> without clothing, that they have no covering in the cold.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a> for want of a shelter.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#005">pledge</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> They cause him to go <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</a> without clothing, and they take away the sheaf from the hungry;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Which make oil within their walls, and tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> The murderer rising with the light killeth the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> and needy, and in the night is as a thief.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> For the morning is to them even as the <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</a> of death: if one know them, they are in the terrors of the <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</a> of death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd108.htm#005">Drought</a> and heat consume the <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#000">snow</a> waters: so doth the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</a> those which have sinned.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> The womb shall forget him; the <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#000">worm</a> shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> He evil entreateth the <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#007">barren</a> that beareth not: and doeth not good to the widow.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no man is sure of life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth; yet his eyes are upon their ways.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all other, and cut off as the tops of the ears of <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And if it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth?<br>
