 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Song of Solomon (Canticles) Chapter 5</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> I am come into my garden, my sister, my <a href="../ebd/ebd350.htm#002">spouse</a>: I have gathered my <a href="../ebd/ebd263.htm#003">myrrh</a> with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my <a href="../ebd/ebd181.htm#001">honey</a>; I have <a href="../ebd/ebd108.htm#007">drunk</a> my <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> with my <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#000">milk</a>: eat, O friends; <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>, yea, <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> abundantly, O beloved.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> I sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my <a href="../ebd/ebd106.htm#007">dove</a>, my undefiled: for my head is filled with <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#008">dew</a>, and my locks with the drops of the night.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> I have put off my <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#004">coat</a>; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#004">bowels</a> were moved for him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with <a href="../ebd/ebd263.htm#003">myrrh</a>, and my fingers with sweet smelling <a href="../ebd/ebd263.htm#003">myrrh</a>, upon the handles of the <a href="../ebd/ebd230.htm#009">lock</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#001">veil</a> from me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> I charge you, O daughters of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him, that I am sick of love.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> What is thy beloved more than another beloved, O thou fairest among women? what is thy beloved more than another beloved, that thou dost so charge us?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> His head is as the most fine <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, his locks are bushy, and black as a <a href="../ebd/ebd307.htm#008">raven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters, washed with <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#000">milk</a>, and fitly set.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> His cheeks are as a bed of <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#005">spices</a>, as sweet <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#002">flowers</a>: his lips like lilies, dropping sweet smelling <a href="../ebd/ebd263.htm#003">myrrh</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> His hands are as <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> rings set with the <a href="../ebd/ebd053.htm#008">beryl</a>: his <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</a> is as bright <a href="../ebd/ebd192.htm#000">ivory</a> overlaid with sapphires.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> His legs are as pillars of <a href="../ebd/ebd241.htm#006">marble</a>, set upon sockets of fine <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>: his countenance is as <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</a>, excellent as the cedars.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
