  <h3 align="center">Darby Bible: Philippians</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> Paul and Timotheus, bondmen of Jesus Christ, to all the  saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with [the]  overseers and ministers;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> grace to you, and peace from God our Father and [the] Lord  Jesus Christ.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> I thank my God for my whole remembrance of you,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> constantly in my every supplication, making the supplication  for you all with joy,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> because of your fellowship with the gospel, from the first  day until now;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> having confidence of this very thing, that he who has begun  in you a good work will complete it unto Jesus Christ's day:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> as it is righteous for me to think this as to you all,  because ye have *me* in your hearts, and that both in my bonds  and in the defence and confirmation of the glad tidings ye are  all participators in my grace.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> For God is my witness how I long after you all in [the]  bowels of Christ Jesus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more  in full knowledge and all intelligence,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> that ye may judge of and approve the things that are more  excellent, in order that ye may be pure and without offence for  Christ's day,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> being complete as regards the fruit of righteousness, which  [is] by Jesus Christ, to God's glory and praise.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> But I would have you know, brethren, that the circumstances  in which I am have turned out rather to the furtherance of the  glad tidings,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> so that my bonds have become manifest [as being] in Christ  in all the praetorium and to all others;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> and that the most of the brethren, trusting in [the] Lord  through my bonds, dare more abundantly to speak the word of God  fearlessly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> Some indeed also for envy and strife, but some also for  good will, preach the Christ.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> These indeed out of love, knowing that I am set for the  defence of the glad tidings;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> but those out of contention, announce the Christ, not  purely, supposing to arouse tribulation for my bonds.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> What is it then? at any rate, in every way, whether in  pretext or in truth, Christ is announced; and in this I  rejoice, yea, also I will rejoice;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:19">1:19</a> for I know that this shall turn out for me to salvation,  through your supplication and [the] supply of the Spirit of  Jesus Christ;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:20">1:20</a> according to my earnest expectation and hope, that in  nothing I shall be ashamed, but in all boldness, as always, now  also Christ shall be magnified in my body whether by life or by  death.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:21">1:21</a> For for me to live [is] Christ, and to die gain;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:22">1:22</a> but if to live in flesh [is my lot], this is for me worth  the while: and what I shall choose I cannot tell.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:23">1:23</a> But I am pressed by both, having the desire for departure  and being with Christ, [for] [it is] very much better,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:24">1:24</a> but remaining in the flesh [is] more necessary for your  sakes;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:25">1:25</a> and having confidence of this, I know that I shall remain  and abide along with you all, for your progress and joy in  faith;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:26">1:26</a> that your boasting may abound in Christ Jesus through me by  my presence again with you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:27">1:27</a> Only conduct yourselves worthily of the glad tidings of the  Christ, in order that whether coming and seeing you, or absent,  I may hear of what concerns you, that ye stand firm in one  spirit, with one soul, labouring together in the same conflict  with the faith of the glad tidings;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:28">1:28</a> and not frightened in anything by the opposers, which is to  them a demonstration of destruction, but of your salvation, and  that from God;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:29">1:29</a> because to you has been given, as regards Christ, not only  the believing on him but the suffering for him also,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:30">1:30</a> having the same conflict which ye have seen in me, and now  hear of in me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> If then [there be] any comfort in Christ, if any consolation  of love, if any fellowship of [the] Spirit, if any bowels and  compassions,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> fulfil my joy, that ye may think the same thing, having the  same love, joined in soul, thinking one thing;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> [let] nothing [be] in the spirit of strife or vain glory,  but, in lowliness of mind, each esteeming the other as more  excellent than themselves;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> regarding not each his own [qualities], but each those of  others also.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> For let this mind be in you which [was] also in Christ  Jesus;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> who, subsisting in the form of God, did not esteem it an  object of rapine to be on an equality with God;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> but emptied himself, taking a bondman's form, taking his  place in [the] likeness of men;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> and having been found in figure as a man, humbled himself,  becoming obedient even unto death, and [that the] death of  [the] cross.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> Wherefore also God highly exalted him, and granted him a  name, that which is above every name,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of  heavenly and earthly and infernal [beings],</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ [is] Lord to God  [the] Father's glory.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> So that, my beloved, even as ye have always obeyed, not as  in my presence only, but now much rather in my absence, work  out your own salvation with fear and trembling,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> for it is God who works in you both the willing and the  working according to [his] good pleasure.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> Do all things without murmurings and reasonings,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> that ye may be harmless and simple, irreproachable children  of God in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation;  among whom ye appear as lights in [the] world,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> holding forth [the] word of life, so as to be a boast for  me in Christ's day, that I have not run in vain nor laboured in  vain.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> But if also I am poured out as a libation on the sacrifice  and ministration of your faith, I rejoice, and rejoice in  common with you all.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:18">2:18</a> In like manner do *ye* also rejoice, and rejoice with me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:19">2:19</a> But I hope in [the] Lord Jesus to send Timotheus to you  shortly, that *I* also may be refreshed, knowing how ye get on.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:20">2:20</a> For I have no one like-minded who will care with genuine  feeling how ye get on.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:21">2:21</a> For all seek their own things, not the things of Jesus  Christ.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:22">2:22</a> But ye know the proof of him, that, as a child a father, he  has served with me in the work of the glad tidings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:23">2:23</a> Him therefore I hope to send immediately, as soon as I  shall see how it goes with me:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:24">2:24</a> but I trust in [the] Lord that I myself also shall soon  come;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:25">2:25</a> but I have thought it necessary to send to you  Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow-workman and fellow-soldier,  but your messenger and minister to my need,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:26">2:26</a> since he had a longing desire after you all, and was  distressed because ye had heard that he was sick;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:27">2:27</a> for he was also sick close to death, but God had mercy on  him, and not indeed on him alone, but also on me, that I might  not have sorrow upon sorrow.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:28">2:28</a> I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that seeing  him ye might again rejoice, and that *I* might be the less  sorrowful.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:29">2:29</a> Receive him therefore in [the] Lord with all joy, and hold  such in honour;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:30">2:30</a> because for the sake of the work he drew near even to  death, venturing his life that he might fill up what lacked in  your ministration toward me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> For the rest, my brethren, rejoice in [the] Lord: to write  the same things to you, to me [is] not irksome, and for you  safe.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> See to dogs, see to evil workmen, see to the concision.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> For *we* are the circumcision, who worship by [the] Spirit  of God, and boast in Christ Jesus, and do not trust in flesh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> Though *I* have [my] trust even in flesh; if any other think  to trust in flesh, *I* rather:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> as to circumcision, [I received it] the eighth day; of [the]  race of Israel, of [the] tribe of Benjamin, Hebrew of Hebrews;  as to [the] law, a Pharisee;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> as to zeal, persecuting the assembly; as to righteousness  which [is] in [the] law, found blameless;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> but what things were gain to me these I counted, on account  of Christ, loss.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> But surely I count also all things to be loss on account of  the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on  account of whom I have suffered the loss of all, and count them  to be filth, that I may gain Christ;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> and that I may be found in him, not having my righteousness,  which [would be] on the principle of law, but that which is by  faith of Christ, the righteousness which [is] of God through  faith,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> to know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the  fellowship of his sufferings, being conformed to his death,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> if any way I arrive at the resurrection from among [the]  dead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> Not that I have already obtained [the prize], or am already  perfected; but I pursue, if also I may get possession [of it],  seeing that also I have been taken possession of by Christ  [Jesus].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> Brethren, *I* do not count to have got possession myself;  but one thing -- forgetting the things behind, and stretching  out to the things before,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> I pursue, [looking] towards [the] goal, for the prize of  the calling on high of God in Christ Jesus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> As many therefore as [are] perfect, let us be thus minded;  and if ye are any otherwise minded, this also God shall reveal  to you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> But whereto we have attained, [let us] walk in the same  steps.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> Be imitators [all] together of me, brethren, and fix your  eyes on those walking thus as you have us for a model;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:18">3:18</a> (for many walk of whom I have told you often, and now tell  you even weeping, that they [are] the enemies of the cross of  Christ:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:19">3:19</a> whose end [is] destruction, whose god [is] the belly, and  [their] glory in their shame, who mind earthly things:)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:20">3:20</a> for *our* commonwealth has its existence in [the] heavens,  from which also we await the Lord Jesus Christ [as] Saviour,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:21">3:21</a> who shall transform our body of humiliation into conformity  to his body of glory, according to the working of [the] power  which he has even to subdue all things to himself.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> So that, my brethren, beloved and longed for, my joy and  crown, thus stand fast in [the] Lord, beloved.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> I exhort Euodia, and exhort Syntyche, to be of the same mind  in [the] Lord;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> yea, I ask thee also, true yokefellow, assist them, who have  contended along with me in the glad tidings, with Clement also,  and my other fellow-labourers, whose names [are] in [the] book  of life.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> Rejoice in [the] Lord always: again I will say, Rejoice.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> Let your gentleness be known of all men. The Lord [is] near.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> Be careful about nothing; but in everything, by prayer and  supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known  to God;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> and the peace of God, which surpasses every understanding,  shall guard your hearts and your thoughts by Christ Jesus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> For the rest, brethren, whatsoever things [are] true,  whatsoever things [are] noble, whatsoever things [are] just,  whatsoever things [are] pure, whatsoever things [are] amiable,  whatsoever things [are] of good report; if [there be] any  virtue and if any praise, think on these things.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:9">4:9</a> What ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen  in me, these things do; and the God of peace shall be with you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:10">4:10</a> But I rejoiced in [the] Lord greatly, that now however at  length ye have revived your thinking of me, though surely ye  did also think [of me], but lacked opportunity.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:11">4:11</a> Not that I speak as regards privation, for as to me *I*  have learnt in those circumstances in which I am, to be  satisfied in myself.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:12">4:12</a> I know both how to be abased and I know how to abound. In  everything and in all things I am initiated both to be full and  to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer privation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:13">4:13</a> I have strength for all things in him that gives me power.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:14">4:14</a> But ye have done well in taking part in my affliction.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:15">4:15</a> And know also *ye*, O Philippians, that in [the] beginning  of the gospel, when I came out of Macedonia, no assembly  communicated [anything] to me in [the] way of giving and  receiving save *ye* alone;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:16">4:16</a> for also in Thessalonica once and even twice ye sent to me  for my need.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:17">4:17</a> Not that I seek gift, but I seek fruit abounding to your  account.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:18">4:18</a> But I have all things in full supply and abound; I am full,  having received of Epaphroditus the things [sent] from you, an  odour of sweet savour, an acceptable sacrifice, agreeable to  God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:19">4:19</a> But my God shall abundantly supply all your need according  to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:20">4:20</a> But to our God and Father [be] glory to the ages of ages.  Amen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:21">4:21</a> Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren who [are]  with me salute you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:22">4:22</a> All the saints salute you, and specially those of the  household of Caesar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:23">4:23</a> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ [be] with your spirit.  Amen.</p>
