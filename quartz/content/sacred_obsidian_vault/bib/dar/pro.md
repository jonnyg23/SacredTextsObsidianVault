  <h3 align="center">Darby Bible: Proverbs</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> Proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> to know wisdom and instruction; to discern the words of  understanding;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> to receive the instruction of wisdom, righteousness and  judgment, and equity;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> to give prudence to the simple, to the young man knowledge  and discretion.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> He that is wise will hear, and will increase learning; and  the intelligent will gain wise counsels:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> to understand a proverb and an allegory, the words of the  wise and their enigmas.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge: fools  despise wisdom and instruction.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> Hear, my son, the instruction of thy father, and forsake not  the teaching of thy mother;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> for they shall be a garland of grace unto thy head, and  chains about thy neck.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> My son, if sinners entice thee, consent not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let  us lurk secretly for the innocent without cause;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> let us swallow them up alive as Sheol, and whole, as those  that go down into the pit;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> we shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our  houses with spoil:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> cast in thy lot among us; we will all have one purse:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> -- my son, walk not in the way with them, keep back thy  foot from their path;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> for their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed  blood.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> For in vain the net is spread in the sight of anything  which hath wings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> And these lay wait for their own blood; they lurk secretly  for their own lives.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:19">1:19</a> So are the paths of every one that is greedy of gain: it  taketh away the life of its possessors.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:20">1:20</a> Wisdom crieth without; she raiseth her voice in the  broadways;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:21">1:21</a> she calleth in the chief [place] of concourse, in the entry  of the gates; in the city she uttereth her words:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:22">1:22</a> How long, simple ones, will ye love simpleness, and  scorners take pleasure in their scorning, and the foolish hate  knowledge?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:23">1:23</a> Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour forth my spirit  unto you, I will make known to you my words.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:24">1:24</a> Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out  my hand, and no one regarded;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:25">1:25</a> and ye have rejected all my counsel, and would none of my  reproof:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:26">1:26</a> I also will laugh in your calamity, I will mock when your  fear cometh;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:27">1:27</a> when your fear cometh as sudden destruction, and your  calamity cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish come  upon you:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:28">1:28</a> -- then will they call upon me, but I will not answer; they  will seek me early, and shall not find me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:29">1:29</a> Because they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear  of Jehovah;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:30">1:30</a> they would none of my counsel, they despised all my  reproof:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:31">1:31</a> therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their way, and be  filled with their own devices.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:32">1:32</a> For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the  prosperity of the foolish shall cause them to perish.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:33">1:33</a> But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall  be at rest from fear of evil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> My son, if thou receivest my words, and layest up my  commandments with thee,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> so that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom [and] thou apply  thy heart to understanding;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> yea, if thou criest after discernment [and] liftest up thy  voice to understanding;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> if thou seekest her as silver and searchest for her as for  hidden treasures:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> then shalt thou understand the fear of Jehovah, and find the  knowledge of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> For Jehovah giveth wisdom; out of his mouth [come] knowledge  and understanding.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> He layeth up sound wisdom for the upright; [he] is a shield  to them that walk in integrity;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> guarding the paths of just judgment and keeping the way of  his godly ones.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> Then shalt thou understand righteousness and judgment and  equity: every good path.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> When wisdom entereth into thy heart and knowledge is  pleasant unto thy soul,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> discretion shall keep thee, understanding shall preserve  thee:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> To deliver thee from the way of evil, from the man that  speaketh froward things;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> [from those] who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in  the ways of darkness;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> who rejoice to do evil, [and] delight in the frowardness of  evil;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> whose paths are crooked, and who are perverted in their  course:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> To deliver thee from the strange woman, from the stranger  who flattereth with her words;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> who forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the  covenant of her God;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:18">2:18</a> -- for her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto  the dead;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:19">2:19</a> none that go unto her return again, neither do they attain  to the paths of life:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:20">2:20</a> -- that thou mayest walk in the way of the good, and keep  the paths of the righteous.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:21">2:21</a> For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect  shall remain in it;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:22">2:22</a> but the wicked shall be cut off from the land, and the  unfaithful shall be plucked up out of it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> My son, forget not my teaching, and let thy heart observe my  commandments;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> for length of days, and years of life, and peace shall they  add to thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> Let not loving-kindness and truth forsake thee; bind them  about thy neck, write them upon the tablet of thy heart:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> and thou shalt find favour and good understanding in the  sight of God and man.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> Confide in Jehovah with all thy heart, and lean not unto  thine own intelligence;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> in all thy ways acknowledge him, and he will make plain thy  paths.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> Be not wise in thine own eyes; fear Jehovah, and depart from  evil:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> it shall be health for thy navel, and moisture for thy  bones.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> Honour Jehovah with thy substance, and with the first-fruits  of all thine increase;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> so shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy vats  shall overflow with new wine.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> My son, despise not the instruction of Jehovah, neither be  weary of his chastisement;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> for whom Jehovah loveth he chasteneth, even as a father the  son in whom he delighteth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> Blessed is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that  getteth understanding.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> For the gain thereof is better than the gain of silver, and  her revenue than fine gold.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> She is more precious than rubies; and all the things thou  canst desire are not equal unto her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> Length of days is in her right hand; in her left hand  riches and honour.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are  peace.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:18">3:18</a> She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her; and  happy is he that retaineth her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:19">3:19</a> Jehovah by wisdom founded the earth; by understanding he  established the heavens.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:20">3:20</a> By his knowledge the deeps were broken up, and the skies  drop down the dew.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:21">3:21</a> My son, let them not depart from thine eyes; keep sound  wisdom and discretion:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:22">3:22</a> so shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace unto thy  neck.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:23">3:23</a> Then shalt thou walk in thy way securely, and thy foot  shall not stumble;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:24">3:24</a> when thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid, but thou  shalt lie down and thy sleep shall be sweet.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:25">3:25</a> Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the destruction of  the wicked, when it cometh;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:26">3:26</a> for Jehovah shall be thy confidence, and he will keep thy  foot from being taken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:27">3:27</a> Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is  in the power of thy hand to do it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:28">3:28</a> Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and  to-morrow I will give, when thou hast it by thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:29">3:29</a> Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth  securely by thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:30">3:30</a> Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee  no harm.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:31">3:31</a> Envy not the man of violence, and choose none of his ways.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:32">3:32</a> For the perverse is an abomination to Jehovah; but his  secret is with the upright.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:33">3:33</a> The curse of Jehovah is in the house of the wicked; but he  blesseth the habitation of the righteous.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:34">3:34</a> He indeed scorneth the scorners; but he giveth grace unto  the lowly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:35">3:35</a> The wise shall inherit glory; but shame shall be the  promotion of the foolish.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend  to know intelligence;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> for I give you good doctrine: forsake ye not my law.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> For I was a son unto my father, tender and an only one in  the sight of my mother.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> And he taught me, and said unto me, Let thy heart retain my  words; keep my commandments and live.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> Get wisdom, get intelligence: forget [it] not; neither  decline from the words of my mouth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> Forsake her not, and she shall keep thee; love her, and she  shall preserve thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> The beginning of wisdom [is], Get wisdom; and with all thy  getting get intelligence.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> Exalt her, and she shall promote thee; she shall bring thee  to honour when thou dost embrace her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:9">4:9</a> She shall give to thy head a garland of grace; a crown of  glory will she bestow upon thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:10">4:10</a> Hear, my son, and receive my sayings, and the years of thy  life shall be multiplied.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:11">4:11</a> I will teach thee in the way of wisdom, I will lead thee in  paths of uprightness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:12">4:12</a> When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and  when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:13">4:13</a> Take fast hold of instruction, let [her] not go: keep her,  for she is thy life.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:14">4:14</a> Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the  way of evil [men]:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:15">4:15</a> avoid it, pass not by it; turn from it, and pass away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:16">4:16</a> For they sleep not except they have done mischief, and  their sleep is taken away unless they have caused [some] to  fall.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:17">4:17</a> For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of  violence.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:18">4:18</a> But the path of the righteous is as the shining light,  going on and brightening until the day be fully come.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:19">4:19</a> The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what  they stumble.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:20">4:20</a> My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my  sayings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:21">4:21</a> Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst  of thy heart.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:22">4:22</a> For they are life unto those that find them, and health to  all their flesh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:23">4:23</a> Keep thy heart more than anything that is guarded; for out  of it are the issues of life.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:24">4:24</a> Put away from thee perverseness of mouth, and corrupt lips  put far from thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:25">4:25</a> Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look  straight before thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:26">4:26</a> Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be  well-ordered.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:27">4:27</a> Turn not to the right hand nor to the left; remove thy foot  from evil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:1">5:1</a> My son, attend unto my wisdom, incline thine ear to my  understanding;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:2">5:2</a> that thou mayest keep reflection, and that thy lips may  preserve knowledge.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:3">5:3</a> For the lips of the strange woman drop honey, and her mouth  is smoother than oil;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:4">5:4</a> but her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged  sword.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:5">5:5</a> Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on Sheol.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:6">5:6</a> Lest she should ponder the path of life, her ways wander,  she knoweth not [whither].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:7">5:7</a> And now, children, hearken unto me, and depart not from the  words of my mouth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:8">5:8</a> Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of  her house:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:9">5:9</a> lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto  the cruel;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:10">5:10</a> lest strangers be filled with thy wealth, and the fruits of  thy toil [come] into the house of a stranger;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:11">5:11</a> and thou mourn in thine end, when thy flesh and thy body  are consumed;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:12">5:12</a> and thou say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart  despised reproof!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:13">5:13</a> and I have not hearkened unto the voice of my teachers, nor  inclined mine ear to those that instructed me;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:14">5:14</a> I was well nigh in all evil in the midst of the  congregation and assembly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:15">5:15</a> Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters  out of thine own well.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:16">5:16</a> Thy fountains shall be poured forth, as water-brooks in the  broadways.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:17">5:17</a> Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:18">5:18</a> Let thy fountain be blessed; and have joy of the wife of  thy youth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:19">5:19</a> As a lovely hind and a graceful roe, let her breasts  satisfy thee at all times: be thou ravished continually with  her love.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:20">5:20</a> And why shouldest thou, my son, be ravished with a strange  woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:21">5:21</a> For the ways of man are before the eyes of Jehovah, and he  pondereth all his paths.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:22">5:22</a> His own iniquities shall take the wicked, and he shall be  holden with the cords of his sin.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:23">5:23</a> He shall die for want of discipline; and in the greatness  of his folly he shall go astray.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:1">6:1</a> My son, if thou hast become surety for thy friend, if thou  hast stricken thy hand for a stranger,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:2">6:2</a> thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken  with the words of thy mouth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:3">6:3</a> Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, since thou hast  come into the hand of thy friend: go, humble thyself, and be  urgent with thy friend.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:4">6:4</a> Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:5">6:5</a> deliver thyself as a gazelle from the hand [of the hunter],  and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:6">6:6</a> Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways and be wise:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:7">6:7</a> which having no chief, overseer, or ruler,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:8">6:8</a> provideth her bread in the summer, [and] gathereth her food  in the harvest.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:9">6:9</a> How long, sluggard, wilt thou lie down? When wilt thou arise  out of thy sleep?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:10">6:10</a> A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the  hands to rest!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:11">6:11</a> So shall thy poverty come as a roving plunderer, and thy  penury as an armed man.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:12">6:12</a> A man of Belial, a wicked person, is he that goeth about  with a perverse mouth;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:13">6:13</a> he winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he  teacheth with his fingers;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:14">6:14</a> deceits are in his heart; he deviseth mischief at all  times, he soweth discords.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:15">6:15</a> Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly: in a moment  shall he be broken, and without remedy.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:16">6:16</a> These six [things] doth Jehovah hate, yea, seven are an  abomination unto him:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:17">6:17</a> haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent  blood;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:18">6:18</a> a heart that deviseth wicked imaginations; feet that are  swift in running to mischief;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:19">6:19</a> a false witness that uttereth lies, and he that soweth  discords among brethren.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:20">6:20</a> My son, observe thy father's commandment, and forsake not  the teaching of thy mother;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:21">6:21</a> bind them continually upon thy heart, tie them about thy  neck:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:22">6:22</a> when thou walkest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest,  it shall keep thee; and [when] thou awakest, it shall talk with  thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:23">6:23</a> For the commandment is a lamp, and the teaching a light,  and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:24">6:24</a> to keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the  tongue of a strange woman.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:25">6:25</a> Lust not after her beauty in thy heart, neither let her  take thee with her eyelids;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:26">6:26</a> for by means of a whorish woman [a man is brought] to a  loaf of bread, and another's wife doth hunt for the precious  soul.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:27">6:27</a> Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his garments not be  burned?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:28">6:28</a> Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be scorched?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:29">6:29</a> So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife: whosoever  toucheth her shall not be innocent.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:30">6:30</a> They do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his  soul when he is hungry:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:31">6:31</a> and if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall  give all the substance of his house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:32">6:32</a> Whoso committeth adultery with a woman is void of  understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:33">6:33</a> A wound and contempt shall he get; and his reproach shall  not be wiped away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:34">6:34</a> For jealousy is the rage of a man, and he will not spare in  the day of vengeance;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:35">6:35</a> he will not regard any ransom, neither will he rest content  though thou multipliest [thy] gifts.</p>

 <p><a name="an_7:6">7:6</a> For at the window of my house, I looked forth through my  lattice,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:7">7:7</a> and I beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the  sons, a young man void of understanding,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:8">7:8</a> passing through the street near her corner; and he went the  way to her house,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:9">7:9</a> in the twilight, in the evening of the day, in the blackness  of night and the darkness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:10">7:10</a> And behold, there met him a woman in the attire of a  harlot, and subtle of heart.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:11">7:11</a> She is clamorous and unmanageable; her feet abide not in  her house:</p>

 <p><a name="an_7:13">7:13</a> And she caught him and kissed him, and with an impudent  face said unto him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:14">7:14</a> I have peace-offerings with me; this day have I paid my  vows:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:15">7:15</a> therefore came I forth to meet thee, to seek earnestly thy  face, and I have found thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:16">7:16</a> I have decked my bed with tapestry coverlets of variegated  linen from Egypt;</p>

 <p><a name="an_7:18">7:18</a> Come, let us revel in love until the morning, let us  delight ourselves with loves.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:19">7:19</a> For the husband is not at home, he is gone a long journey;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:20">7:20</a> he hath taken the money-bag with him, he will come home on  the day of the full moon.</p>

 <p><a name="an_7:27">7:27</a> Her house is the way to Sheol, going down to the chambers  of death.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:1">8:1</a> Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding give forth her voice?</p>

 <p><a name="an_29:14">29:14</a> A king that faithfully judgeth the poor, his throne shall  be established for ever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:15">29:15</a> The rod and reproof give wisdom; but a child left [to  himself] bringeth his mother to shame.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:16">29:16</a> When the wicked increase, transgression increaseth; but  the righteous shall see their fall.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:17">29:17</a> Chasten thy son, and he shall give thee rest, and shall  give delight unto thy soul.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:18">29:18</a> Where there is no vision the people cast off restraint;  but happy is he that keepeth the law.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:19">29:19</a> A servant is not corrected by words: he understandeth  indeed, but he will not answer.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:20">29:20</a> Hast thou seen a man hasty in his words? there is more  hope of a fool than of him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:21">29:21</a> He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child,  shall in the end have him as a son.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:22">29:22</a> An angry man exciteth contention; and a furious man  aboundeth in transgression.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:23">29:23</a> A man's pride bringeth him low; but the humble in spirit  shall obtain honour.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:24">29:24</a> Whoso shareth with a thief hateth his own soul: he heareth  the adjuration, and declareth not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:25">29:25</a> The fear of man bringeth a snare; but whoso putteth his  confidence in Jehovah is protected.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:26">29:26</a> Many seek the ruler's face; but a man's right judgment is  from Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:27">29:27</a> An unjust man is an abomination to the righteous; and he  that is of upright way is an abomination to the wicked [man].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:1">30:1</a> The words of Agur the son of Jakeh; the prophecy uttered by  the man unto Ithiel, [even] unto Ithiel and Ucal:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:2">30:2</a> Truly *I* am more stupid than any one; and I have not a  man's intelligence.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:3">30:3</a> I have neither learned wisdom, nor have I the knowledge of  the Holy.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:4">30:4</a> Who hath ascended up into the heavens, and descended? Who  hath gathered the wind in his fists? Who hath bound the waters  in a mantle? Who hath established all the ends of the earth?  What is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou knowest?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:5">30:5</a> Every word of +God is pure: he is a shield unto them that  put their trust in him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:6">30:6</a> Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou  be found a liar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:7">30:7</a> Two things do I ask of thee; deny me [them] not before I  die:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:8">30:8</a> Remove far from me vanity and lies; give me neither poverty  nor riches; feed me with the bread of my daily need:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:9">30:9</a> lest I be full and deny [thee], and say, Who is Jehovah? or  lest I be poor and steal, and outrage the name of my God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:10">30:10</a> Speak not too much about a servant to his master, lest he  curse thee, and thou be held guilty.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:11">30:11</a> There is a generation that curseth their father, and doth  not bless their mother;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:12">30:12</a> there is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, yet  are not washed from their filthiness;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:13">30:13</a> there is a generation, -- how lofty are their eyes, how  their eyelids are lifted up!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:14">30:14</a> -- a generation whose teeth are swords, and their  jaw-teeth knives, to devour the afflicted from off the earth,  and the needy from [among] men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:15">30:15</a> The leech hath two daughters: Give, give. There are three  [things] never satisfied; four which say not, It is enough:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:16">30:16</a> -- Sheol, and the barren womb; the earth which is not  filled with water, and the fire which saith not, It is enough.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:17">30:17</a> The eye that mocketh at a father, and despiseth to obey a  mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the  young eagles shall eat it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:18">30:18</a> There are three [things] too wonderful for me, and four  that I know not:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:19">30:19</a> The way of an eagle in the heavens, the way of a serpent  upon a rock, the way of a ship in the midst of the sea, and the  way of a man with a maid.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:20">30:20</a> Such is the way of an adulterous woman: she eateth, and  wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:21">30:21</a> Under three [things] the earth is disquieted, and under  four it cannot bear up:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:22">30:22</a> Under a servant when he reigneth, and a churl when he is  filled with meat;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:23">30:23</a> under an odious [woman] when she is married, and a  handmaid when she is heir to her mistress.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:24">30:24</a> There are four [things] little upon the earth, and they  are exceeding wise:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:25">30:25</a> The ants, a people not strong, yet they provide their food  in the summer;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:26">30:26</a> the rock-badgers are but a feeble folk, yet they make  their house in the cliff;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:27">30:27</a> the locusts have no king, yet they go forth all of them by  bands;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:28">30:28</a> thou takest hold of the lizard with the hands, yet is she  in kings' palaces.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:29">30:29</a> There are three [things] which have a stately step, and  four are comely in going:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:30">30:30</a> The lion, mighty among beasts, which turneth not away for  any;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:31">30:31</a> a [horse] girt in the loins; or the he-goat; and a king,  against whom none can rise up.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:32">30:32</a> If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if  thou hast thought evil, [lay] the hand upon thy mouth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:33">30:33</a> For the pressing of milk bringeth forth butter, and the  pressing of the nose bringeth forth blood; and the pressing of  anger bringeth forth strife.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:1">31:1</a> The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother  taught him:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:2">31:2</a> What, my son? and what, O son of my womb? and what, O son  of my vows?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:3">31:3</a> Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to them that  destroy kings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:4">31:4</a> It is not for kings, Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink  wine, nor for rulers [to say], Where is the strong drink?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:5">31:5</a> -- lest they drink and forget the law, and pervert the  judgment of any of the children of affliction.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:6">31:6</a> Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and  wine unto the bitter of soul:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:7">31:7</a> let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his  misery no more.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:8">31:8</a> Open thy mouth for the dumb, for the cause of all those  that are left desolate.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:9">31:9</a> Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and minister justice to  the afflicted and needy.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:10">31:10</a> Who can find a woman of worth? for her price is far above  rubies.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:11">31:11</a> The heart of her husband confideth in her, and he shall  have no lack of spoil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:12">31:12</a> She doeth him good, and not evil, all the days of her  life.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:13">31:13</a> She seeketh wool and flax, and worketh willingly with her  hands.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:14">31:14</a> She is like the merchants' ships: she bringeth her food  from afar;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:15">31:15</a> And she riseth while it is yet night, and giveth meat to  her household, and the day's work to her maidens.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:16">31:16</a> She considereth a field, and acquireth it; of the fruit of  her hands she planteth a vineyard.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:17">31:17</a> She girdeth her loins with strength, and maketh strong her  arms.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:18">31:18</a> She perceiveth that her earning is good; her lamp goeth  not out by night.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:19">31:19</a> She putteth her hands to the distaff, and her hands hold  the spindle.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:20">31:20</a> She stretcheth out her hand to the afflicted, and she  reacheth forth her hands to the needy.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:21">31:21</a> She is not afraid of the snow for her household; for all  her household are clothed with scarlet.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:22">31:22</a> She maketh herself coverlets; her clothing is byssus and  purple.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:23">31:23</a> Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among  the elders of the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:24">31:24</a> She maketh body linen and selleth it, and delivereth  girdles unto the merchant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:25">31:25</a> Strength and dignity are her clothing, and she laugheth  [at] the coming day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:26">31:26</a> She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and upon her tongue is  the law of kindness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:27">31:27</a> She surveyeth the ways of her household, and eateth not  the bread of idleness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:28">31:28</a> Her children rise up and call her blessed; her husband  [also], and he praiseth her:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:29">31:29</a> Many daughters have done worthily, but thou excellest them  all.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:30">31:30</a> Gracefulness is deceitful and beauty is vain; a woman  [that] feareth Jehovah, she shall be praised.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:31">31:31</a> Give her of the fruit of her hands, and let her own works  praise her in the gates.</p>
