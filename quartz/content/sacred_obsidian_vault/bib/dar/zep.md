  <h3 align="center">Darby Bible: Zephaniah</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> The word of Jehovah that came unto Zephaniah the son of  Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of  Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> I will utterly take away everything from off the face of the  ground, saith Jehovah:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> I will take away man and beast; I will take away the fowl of  the heavens and the fishes of the sea, and the stumbling-blocks  with the wicked, and I will cut off mankind from off the face  of the ground, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> And I will stretch forth my hand upon Judah, and upon all  the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of  Baal from this place, the name of the Chemarim with the  priests;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> and them that bow down to the host of the heavens upon the  housetops; and them that bow down to Jehovah, that swear by  [him], and swear by Malcham;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> and them that turn back from after Jehovah, and that do not  seek Jehovah, nor inquire for him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> Be silent at the presence of the Lord Jehovah; for the day  of Jehovah is at hand; for Jehovah hath prepared a sacrifice,  he hath hallowed his guests.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> And it shall come to pass in the day of Jehovah's sacrifice,  that I will punish the princes, and the king's sons, and all  such as are clothed with foreign apparel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> And in that day will I punish all those that leap over the  threshold, who fill their master's house with violence and  deceit.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> And in that day, saith Jehovah, there shall be the noise of  a cry from the fish-gate, and a howling from the second  [quarter], and a great crashing from the hills.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> Howl, ye inhabitants of Maktesh; for all the people of  Canaan are cut down, all they that are laden with silver are  cut off.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> And it shall come to pass at that time, [that] I will  search Jerusalem with lamps, and punish the men that are  settled on their lees, that say in their heart, Jehovah will  not do good, neither will he do evil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> And their wealth shall become a booty, and their houses a  desolation; and they shall build houses, and not inhabit them;  and they shall plant vineyards, and not drink the wine thereof.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> The great day of Jehovah is near, it is near, and hasteth  greatly. The voice of the day of Jehovah: the mighty man shall  cry there bitterly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress,  a day of ruin and desolation, a day of darkness and gloom, a  day of clouds and gross darkness,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> a day of the trumpet and alarm, against the fenced cities  and against the high battlements.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> And I will bring distress upon men, and they shall walk  like blind men; for they have sinned against Jehovah; and their  blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as dung:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver  them, in the day of Jehovah's wrath; but the whole land shall  be devoured by the fire of his jealousy: for a full end, yea, a  sudden [end], shall he make of all them that dwell in the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> Collect yourselves and gather together, O nation without  shame,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> before the decree bring forth, [before] the day pass away as  chaff, before the fierce anger of Jehovah come upon you, before  the day of Jehovah's anger come upon you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> Seek Jehovah, all ye meek of the land, who have performed  his ordinance; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye  shall be hid in the day of Jehovah's anger.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> For Gazah shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon shall be a  desolation; they shall drive out Ashdod at noonday, and Ekron  shall be rooted up.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea-coast, the nation of the  Cherethites! The word of Jehovah is against you, O Canaan, land  of the Philistines: I will destroy thee, that there shall be no  inhabitant;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> and the sea-coast shall be cave-dwellings for shepherds, and  folds for flocks.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of  Judah; they shall feed thereon: in the houses of Ashkelon shall  they lie down in the evening: for Jehovah their God shall visit  them, and turn again their captivity.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the  children of Ammon, wherewith they have reproached my people,  and magnified themselves against their border.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> Therefore, [as] I live, saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of  Israel, Moab shall certainly be as Sodom, and the children of  Ammon as Gomorrah, a possession of nettles, and salt-pits, and  a perpetual desolation; the remnant of my people shall spoil  them, and the residue of my nation shall possess them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> This shall they have for their pride, because they have  reproached and magnified themselves against the people of  Jehovah of hosts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> Jehovah will be terrible unto them; for he will famish all  the gods of the earth; and all the isles of the nations shall  worship him, every one from his place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> Ye Ethiopians also, ye shall be the slain of my sword.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and  destroy Assyria; and will make Nineveh a desolation, a place of  drought like the wilderness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her, all the  crowd of beasts; both the pelican and the bittern shall lodge  in the chapiters thereof; a voice shall sing in the windows;  desolation shall be on the thresholds: for he hath laid bare  the cedar work.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> This is the rejoicing city that dwelt in security, that  said in her heart, I am, and there is none else beside me: how  is she become a desolation, a couching-place for beasts! Every  one that passeth by her shall hiss, shall wave his hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> Woe to her that is rebellious and corrupted, to the  oppressing city!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> She hearkened not to the voice; she received not correction;  she confided not in Jehovah; she drew not near her God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> Her princes in the midst of her are roaring lions; her  judges are evening wolves, that leave nothing for the morning.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> Her prophets are vain-glorious, treacherous persons; her  priests profane the sanctuary, they do violence to the law.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> The righteous Jehovah is in the midst of her: he doeth no  wrong. Every morning doth he bring his judgment to light; it  faileth not: but the unrighteous knoweth no shame.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> I have cut off nations: their battlements are desolate; I  made their streets waste, that none passeth by; their cities  are destroyed, so that there is no man, so that there is no  inhabitant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> I said, Only fear me, receive correction; so her dwelling  shall not be cut off, howsoever I may punish her. But they rose  early, they corrupted all their doings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> Therefore wait ye for me, saith Jehovah, until the day that  I rise up to the prey; for my determination is to assemble the  nations, that I may gather the kingdoms together, to pour upon  them mine indignation, -- all my fierce anger: for all the  earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> For then will I turn to the peoples a pure language, that  they may all call upon the name of Jehovah, to serve him with  one consent.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> From beyond the rivers of Cush my suppliants, the daughter  of my dispersed, shall bring mine oblation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> In that day thou shalt not be ashamed for all thy doings  wherein thou hast transgressed against me; for then I will take  away out of the midst of thee them that exult in thy pride, and  thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy mountain.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> And I will leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor  people, and they shall trust in the name of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> The remnant of Israel shall not work unrighteousness, nor  speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their  mouth: but *they* shall feed and lie down, and none shall make  them afraid.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> Exult, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; rejoice and be  glad with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> Jehovah hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out  thine enemy; the King of Israel, Jehovah, is in the midst of  thee; thou shalt not see evil any more.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear not; Zion,  let not thy hands be slack.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> Jehovah thy God is in thy midst, a mighty one that will  save: he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his  love; he will exult over thee with singing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:18">3:18</a> I will gather them that sorrow for the solemn assemblies,  who were of thee: the reproach of it was a burden [unto them].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:19">3:19</a> Behold, at that time I will deal with all them that afflict  thee; and I will save her that halted, and gather her that was  driven out; and I will make them a praise and a name in all the  lands where they have been put to shame.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:20">3:20</a> At that time will I bring you, yea, at the time that I  gather you; for I will make you a name and a praise, among all  the peoples of the earth, when I shall turn again your  captivity before your eyes, saith Jehovah.</p>
