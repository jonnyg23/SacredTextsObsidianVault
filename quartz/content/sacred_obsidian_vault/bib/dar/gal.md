  <h3 align="center">Darby Bible: Galatians</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> Paul, apostle, not from men nor through man, but through  Jesus Christ, and God [the] Father who raised him from among  [the] dead,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> and all the brethren with me, to the assemblies of Galatia.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> Grace to you, and peace, from God [the] Father, and our Lord  Jesus Christ,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> who gave himself for our sins, so that he should deliver us  out of the present evil world, according to the will of our God  and Father;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> to whom [be] glory to the ages of ages. Amen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> I wonder that ye thus quickly change, from him that called  you in Christ's grace, to a different gospel,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> which is not another [one]; but there are some that trouble  you, and desire to pervert the glad tidings of the Christ.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> But if even *we* or an angel out of heaven announce as glad  tidings to you [anything] besides what we have announced as  glad tidings to you, let him be accursed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> As we have said before, now also again I say, If any one  announce to you as glad tidings [anything] besides what ye have  received, let him be accursed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> For do I now seek to satisfy men or God? or do I seek to  please men? If I were yet pleasing men, I were not Christ's  bondman.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> But I let you know, brethren, [as to] the glad tidings  which were announced by me, that they are not according to man.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> For neither did I receive them from man, neither was I  taught [them], but by revelation of Jesus Christ.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> For ye have heard [what was] my conversation formerly in  Judaism, that I excessively persecuted the assembly of God, and  ravaged it;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> and advanced in Judaism beyond many [my] contemporaries in  my nation, being exceedingly zealous of the doctrines of my  fathers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> But when God, who set me apart [even] from my mother's  womb, and called [me] by his grace,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> was pleased to reveal his Son in me, that I may announce  him as glad tidings among the nations, immediately I took not  counsel with flesh and blood,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> nor went I up to Jerusalem to those [who were] apostles  before me; but I went to Arabia, and again returned to  Damascus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to make  acquaintance with Peter, and I remained with him fifteen days;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:19">1:19</a> but I saw none other of the apostles, but James the brother  of the Lord.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:20">1:20</a> Now what I write to you, behold, before God, I do not lie.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:21">1:21</a> Then I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:22">1:22</a> But I was unknown personally to the assemblies of Judaea  which [are] in Christ;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:23">1:23</a> only they were hearing that he who persecuted us formerly  now announces the glad tidings of the faith which formerly he  ravaged:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:24">1:24</a> and they glorified God in me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> Then after a lapse of fourteen years I went up again to  Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with [me];</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> and I went up according to revelation, and I laid before  them the glad tidings which I preach among the nations, but  privately to those conspicuous [among them], lest in any way I  run or had run in vain;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> (but neither was Titus, who was with me, being a Greek,  compelled to be circumcised;)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> and [it was] on account of the false brethren brought in  surreptitiously, who came in surreptitiously to spy out our  liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us  into bondage;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> to whom we yielded in subjection not even for an hour, that  the truth of the glad tidings might remain with you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> But from those who were conspicuous as being somewhat --  whatsoever they were, it makes no difference to me: God does  not accept man's person; for to me those who were conspicuous  communicated nothing;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> but, on the contrary, seeing that the glad tidings of the  uncircumcision were confided to me, even as to Peter that of  the circumcision,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> (for he that wrought in Peter for [the] apostleship of the  circumcision wrought also in me towards the Gentiles,)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> and recognising the grace given to me, James and Cephas and  John, who were conspicuous as being pillars, gave to me and  Barnabas [the] right hands of fellowship, that *we* [should go]  to the nations, and *they* to the circumcision;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> only that we should remember the poor, which same thing  also I was diligent to do.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> But when Peter came to Antioch, I withstood him to [the]  face, because he was to be condemned:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> for before that certain came from James, he ate with [those  of] the nations; but when they came, he drew back and separated  himself, fearing those of [the] circumcision;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> and the rest of the Jews also played the same dissembling  part with him; so that even Barnabas was carried away too by  their dissimulation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> But when I saw that they do not walk straightforwardly,  according to the truth of the glad tidings, I said to Peter  before all, If *thou*, being a Jew, livest as the nations and  not as the Jews, how dost thou compel the nations to Judaize?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> We, Jews by nature, and not sinners of [the] nations,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> but knowing that a man is not justified on the principle of  works of law [nor] but by the faith of Jesus Christ, *we* also  have believed on Christ Jesus, that we might be justified on  the principle of [the] faith of Christ; and not of works of  law; because on the principle of works of law no flesh shall be  justified.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> Now if in seeking to be justified in Christ we also have  been found sinners, then [is] Christ minister of sin? Far be  the thought.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:18">2:18</a> For if the things I have thrown down, these I build again,  I constitute myself a transgressor.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:19">2:19</a> For *I*, through law, have died to law, that I may live to  God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:20">2:20</a> I am crucified with Christ, and no longer live, *I*, but  Christ lives in me; but [in] that I now live in flesh, I live  by faith, the [faith] of the Son of God, who has loved me and  given himself for me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:21">2:21</a> I do not set aside the grace of God; for if righteousness  [is] by law, then Christ has died for nothing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> O senseless Galatians, who has bewitched you; to whom, as  before your very eyes, Jesus Christ has been portrayed,  crucified [among you]?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> This only I wish to learn of you, Have ye received the  Spirit on the principle of works of law, or of [the] report of  faith?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> Are ye so senseless? having begun in Spirit, are ye going to  be made perfect in flesh?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> Have ye suffered so many things in vain, if indeed also in  vain?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> He therefore who ministers to you the Spirit, and works  miracles among you, [is it] on the principle of works of law,  or of [the] report of faith?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> Even as Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as  righteousness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> Know then that they that are on the principle of faith,  these are Abraham's sons;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> and the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the  nations on the principle of faith, announced beforehand the  glad tidings to Abraham: In thee all the nations shall be  blessed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> So that they who are on the principle of faith are blessed  with believing Abraham.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> For as many as are on the principle of works of law are  under curse. For it is written, Cursed is every one who does  not continue in all things which [are] written in the book of  the law to do them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> but that by law no one is justified with God [is] evident,  because The just shall live on the principle of faith;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> but the law is not on the principle of faith; but, He that  shall have done these things shall live by them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law, having  become a curse for us, (for it is written, Cursed [is] every  one hanged upon a tree,)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> that the blessing of Abraham might come to the nations in  Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit  through faith.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> Brethren, (I speak according to man,) even man's confirmed  covenant no one sets aside, or adds other dispositions to.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> But to Abraham were the promises addressed, and to his  seed: he does not say, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one,  And to thy seed; which is Christ.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> Now I say this, A covenant confirmed beforehand by God, the  law, which took place four hundred and thirty years after, does  not annul, so as to make the promise of no effect.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:18">3:18</a> For if the inheritance [be] on the principle of law, [it  is] no longer on the principle of promise; but God gave it in  grace to Abraham by promise.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:19">3:19</a> Why then the law? It was added for the sake of  transgressions, until the seed came to whom the promise was  made, ordained through angels in [the] hand of a mediator.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:20">3:20</a> But a mediator is not of one, but God is one.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:21">3:21</a> [Is] then the law against the promises of God? Far be the  thought. For if a law had been given able to quicken, then  indeed righteousness were on the principle of law;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:22">3:22</a> but the scripture has shut up all things under sin, that  the promise, on the principle of faith of Jesus Christ, should  be given to those that believe.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:23">3:23</a> But before faith came, we were guarded under law, shut up  to faith [which was] about to be revealed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:24">3:24</a> So that the law has been our tutor up to Christ, that we  might be justified on the principle of faith.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:25">3:25</a> But, faith having come, we are no longer under a tutor;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:26">3:26</a> for ye are all God's sons by faith in Christ Jesus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:27">3:27</a> For ye, as many as have been baptised unto Christ, have put  on Christ.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:28">3:28</a> There is no Jew nor Greek; there is no bondman nor freeman;  there is no male and female; for ye are all one in Christ  Jesus:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:29">3:29</a> but if *ye* [are] of Christ, then ye are Abraham's seed,  heirs according to promise.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> Now I say, As long as the heir is a child, he differs  nothing from a bondman, though he be lord of all;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> but he is under guardians and stewards until the period  fixed by the father.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> So we also, when we were children, were held in bondage  under the principles of the world;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> but when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth  his Son, come of woman, come under law,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> that he might redeem those under law, that we might receive  sonship.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> But because ye are sons, God has sent out the Spirit of his  Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> So thou art no longer bondman, but son; but if son, heir  also through God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> But then indeed, not knowing God, ye were in bondage to  those who by nature are not gods;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:9">4:9</a> but now, knowing God, but rather being known by God, how do  ye turn again to the weak and beggarly principles to which ye  desire to be again anew in bondage?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:10">4:10</a> Ye observe days and months and times and years.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:11">4:11</a> I am afraid of you, lest indeed I have laboured in vain as  to you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:12">4:12</a> Be as *I* [am], for *I* also [am] as *ye*, brethren, I  beseech you: ye have not at all wronged me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:13">4:13</a> But ye know that in weakness of the flesh I announced the  glad tidings to you at the first;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:14">4:14</a> and my temptation, which [was] in my flesh, ye did not  slight nor reject with contempt; but ye received me as an angel  of God, as Christ Jesus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:15">4:15</a> What then [was] your blessedness? for I bear you witness  that, if possible, plucking out your own eyes ye would have  given [them] to me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:16">4:16</a> So I have become your enemy in speaking the truth to you?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:17">4:17</a> They are not rightly zealous after you, but desire to shut  you out [from us], that ye may be zealous after them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:18">4:18</a> But [it is] right to be zealous at all times in what is  right, and not only when I am present with you --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:19">4:19</a> my children, of whom I again travail in birth until Christ  shall have been formed in you:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:20">4:20</a> and I should wish to be present with you now, and change my  voice, for I am perplexed as to you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:21">4:21</a> Tell me, ye who are desirous of being under law, do ye not  listen to the law?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:22">4:22</a> For it is written that Abraham had two sons; one of the  maid servant, and one of the free woman.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:23">4:23</a> But he [that was] of the maid servant was born according to  flesh, and he [that was] of the free woman through the promise.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:24">4:24</a> Which things have an allegorical sense; for these are two  covenants: one from mount Sinai, gendering to bondage, which is  Hagar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:25">4:25</a> For Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to  Jerusalem which [is] now, for she is in bondage with her  children;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:26">4:26</a> but the Jerusalem above is free, which is our mother.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:27">4:27</a> For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not;  break out and cry, thou that travailest not; because the  children of the desolate are more numerous than [those] of her  that has a husband.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:28">4:28</a> But *ye*, brethren, after the pattern of Isaac, are  children of promise.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:29">4:29</a> But as then he that was born according to flesh persecuted  him [that was born] according to Spirit, so also [it is] now.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:30">4:30</a> But what says the scripture? Cast out the maid servant and  her son; for the son of the maid servant shall not inherit with  the son of the free woman.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:31">4:31</a> So then, brethren, we are not maid servant's children, but  [children] of the free woman.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:1">5:1</a> Christ has set us free in freedom; stand fast therefore, and  be not held again in a yoke of bondage.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:2">5:2</a> Behold, I, Paul, say to you, that if ye are circumcised,  Christ shall profit you nothing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:3">5:3</a> And I witness again to every man [who is] circumcised, that  he is debtor to do the whole law.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:4">5:4</a> Ye are deprived of all profit from the Christ as separated  [from him], as many as are justified by law; ye have fallen  from grace.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:5">5:5</a> For we, by [the] Spirit, on the principle of faith, await  the hope of righteousness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:6">5:6</a> For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision has any force, nor  uncircumcision; but faith working through love.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:7">5:7</a> Ye ran well; who has stopped you that ye should not obey the  truth?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:8">5:8</a> The persuasibleness [is] not of him that calls you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:9">5:9</a> A little leaven leavens the whole lump.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:10">5:10</a> *I* have confidence as to you in [the] Lord, that ye will  have no other mind; and he that is troubling you shall bear the  guilt [of it], whosoever he may be.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:11">5:11</a> But *I*, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why am I  yet persecuted? Then the scandal of the cross has been done  away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:12">5:12</a> I would that they would even cut themselves off who throw  you into confusion.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:13">5:13</a> For *ye* have been called to liberty, brethren; only [do]  not [turn] liberty into an opportunity to the flesh, but by  love serve one another.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:14">5:14</a> For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in Thou shalt  love thy neighbour as thyself;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:15">5:15</a> but if ye bite and devour one another, see that ye are not  consumed one of another.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:16">5:16</a> But I say, Walk in [the] Spirit, and ye shall no way fulfil  flesh's lust.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:17">5:17</a> For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit  against the flesh: and these things are opposed one to the  other, that ye should not do those things which ye desire;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:18">5:18</a> but if ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under law.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:19">5:19</a> Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are  fornication, uncleanness, licentiousness,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:20">5:20</a> idolatry, sorcery, hatred, strifes, jealousies, angers,  contentions, disputes, schools of opinion,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:21">5:21</a> envyings, murders, drunkennesses, revels, and things like  these; as to which I tell you beforehand, even as I also have  said before, that they who do such things shall not inherit  God's kingdom.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:22">5:22</a> But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,  long-suffering, kindness, goodness, fidelity,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:23">5:23</a> meekness, self-control: against such things there is no  law.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:24">5:24</a> But they that [are] of the Christ have crucified the flesh  with the passions and the lusts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:25">5:25</a> If we live by the Spirit, let us walk also by the Spirit.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:26">5:26</a> Let us not become vain-glorious, provoking one another,  envying one another.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:1">6:1</a> Brethren, if even a man be taken in some fault, ye who are  spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness,  considering thyself lest *thou* also be tempted.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:2">6:2</a> Bear one another's burdens, and thus fulfil the law of the  Christ.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:3">6:3</a> For if any man reputes himself to be something, being  nothing, he deceives himself;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:4">6:4</a> but let each prove his own work, and then he will have his  boast in what belongs to himself alone, and not in what belongs  to another.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:5">6:5</a> For each shall bear his own burden.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:6">6:6</a> Let him that is taught in the word communicate to him that  teaches in all good things.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:7">6:7</a> Be not deceived: God is not mocked; for whatever a man shall  sow, that also shall he reap.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:8">6:8</a> For he that sows to his own flesh, shall reap corruption  from the flesh; but he that sows to the Spirit, from the Spirit  shall reap eternal life:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:9">6:9</a> but let us not lose heart in doing good; for in due time, if  we do not faint, we shall reap.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:10">6:10</a> So then, as we have occasion, let us do good towards all,  and specially towards those of the household of faith.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:11">6:11</a> See how long a letter I have written to you with my own  hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:12">6:12</a> As many as desire to have a fair appearance in [the] flesh,  these compel you to be circumcised, only that they may not be  persecuted because of the cross of Christ.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:13">6:13</a> For neither do they that are circumcised themselves keep  the law; but they wish you to be circumcised, that they may  boast in your flesh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:14">6:14</a> But far be it from me to boast save in the cross of our  Lord Jesus Christ, through whom [the] world is crucified to me,  and I to the world.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:15">6:15</a> For [in Christ Jesus] neither is circumcision anything, nor  uncircumcision; but new creation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:16">6:16</a> And as many as shall walk by this rule, peace upon them and  mercy, and upon the Israel of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:17">6:17</a> For the rest let no one trouble me, for *I* bear in my body  the brands of the Lord Jesus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:18">6:18</a> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with your spirit,  brethren. Amen.</p>
