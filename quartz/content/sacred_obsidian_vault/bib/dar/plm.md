  <h3 align="center">Darby Bible: Philemon</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> Paul, prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timotheus the brother,  to Philemon the beloved and our fellow-workman,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> and to the sister Apphia and to Archippus our  fellow-soldier, and to the assembly which [is] in thine house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and [the] Lord  Jesus Christ.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> I thank my God, always making mention of thee at my prayers,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> hearing of thy love and the faith which thou hast towards  the Lord Jesus, and towards all the saints,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> in such sort that thy participation in the faith should  become operative in the acknowledgment of every good thing  which is in us towards Christ [Jesus].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> For we have great thankfulness and encouragement through thy  love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee,  brother.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> Wherefore having much boldness in Christ to enjoin thee what  is fitting,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> for love's sake I rather exhort, being such a one as Paul  the aged, and now also prisoner of Jesus Christ.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> I exhort thee for *my* child, whom I have begotten in [my]  bonds, Onesimus,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> once unserviceable to thee, but now serviceable to thee and  to me:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> whom I have sent back to thee: [but do *thou* receive] him,  that is, *my* bowels:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> whom *I* was desirous of keeping with myself, that for thee  he might minister to me in the bonds of the glad tidings;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> but I have wished to do nothing without thy mind, that thy  good might not be as of necessity but of willingness:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> for perhaps for this reason he has been separated [from  thee] for a time, that thou mightest possess him fully for  ever;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> not any longer as a bondman, but above a bondman, a beloved  brother, specially to me, and how much rather to thee, both in  [the] flesh and in [the] Lord?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> If therefore thou holdest me to be a partner [with thee],  receive him as me;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> but if he have wronged thee anything or owe anything [to  thee], put this to my account.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:19">1:19</a> *I* Paul have written [it] with mine own hand; *I* will  repay [it]: that I say not to thee that thou owest even thine  own self also to me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:20">1:20</a> Yea, brother, *I* would have profit of *thee* in [the]  Lord: refresh my bowels in Christ.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:21">1:21</a> Being confident of thine obedience, I have written to thee,  knowing that thou wilt do even more than I say.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:22">1:22</a> But withal prepare me also a lodging; for I hope that I  shall be granted to you through your prayers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:23">1:23</a> Epaphras salutes thee, my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:24">1:24</a> Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow-workmen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:25">1:25</a> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with your spirit.</p>
