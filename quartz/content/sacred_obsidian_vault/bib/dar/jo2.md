  <h3 align="center">Darby Bible: 2 John</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> The elder to [the] elect lady and her children, whom *I*  love in truth, and not *I* only but also all who have known the  truth,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> for the truth's sake which abides in us and shall be with us  to eternity.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> Grace shall be with you, mercy, peace from God [the] Father,  and from [the] Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in  truth and love.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> I rejoiced greatly that I have found of thy children walking  in truth, as we have received commandment from the Father.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> And now I beseech thee, lady, not as writing to thee a new  commandment, but that which we have had from [the] beginning,  that we should love one another.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> And this is love, that we should walk according to his  commandments. This is the commandment, according as ye have  heard from the beginning, that ye might walk in it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> For many deceivers have gone out into the world, they who do  not confess Jesus Christ coming in flesh -- this is the  deceiver and the antichrist.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> See to yourselves, that we may not lose what we have  wrought, but may receive full wages.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> Whosoever goes forward and abides not in the doctrine of the  Christ has not God. He that abides in the doctrine, *he* has  both the Father and the Son.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> If any one come to you and bring not this doctrine, do not  receive him into [the] house, and greet him not;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> for he who greets him partakes in his wicked works.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> Having many things to write to you, I would not with paper  and ink; but hope to come to you, and to speak mouth to mouth,  that our joy may be full.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> The children of thine elect sister greet thee.</p>
