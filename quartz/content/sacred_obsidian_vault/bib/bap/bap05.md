 <h3 align="CENTER">4. TITLE, AND ATTRIBUTION TO PHILO.</h3>
 <p>4. The TITLE of the book is somewhat of a puzzle. Sichardus calls it <i>Philonis Judaei antiquitatum Biblicarum liber</i>, the Fulda catalogue (and the label on the Fulda MS.) <i>Philonis antiquitatum liber</i>; a late title in the same MS. is: <i>libri Philonis iudei de initio mundi</i>; P has a title of cent. XV.: <i>Philo iudeus de successione generationum veteris testamenti</i>; R, in the colophon: "<i>ystoria Philonis ab initio mundi usque ad David regem</i>" (so also two at least of the Munich M SS.); Trithemius has <i>De generationis successu</i>. Sixtus Senensis has two notices of the book: in the first, which is drawn from Sichardus., he calls it <i>Biblicarum antiquitatum liber</i>; in the second, which depends on some MS., his words are: "In Gen. Cap. 5 <i>de successione generis humani</i> liber unus, continens enarrationem genealogiae seu posteritatis Adae. Liber incipit: Ἀδὰμ ἐγέννησε <i>Adam genuit</i> </p>
 <p><a name="page_27"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 27</font></a></p>
 <i></i><p>tres filios." The two Greek words I take to be no more than a re-translation from Latin. The MS. V has no title at all.</p>
 <p>Thus we have authority for three names. The first, <i>Biblicarum antiquitatum</i>, I think, must be in part due to Sichardus; the epithet "Biblicarum" savours to my mind of the Renaissance, and has no certain MS. attestation. "Antiquitatum" (which is as old as cent. XIV.) is probably due to a recollection of Josephus's great work, the <i>Jewish Antiquities</i>. The other name, <i>de successione generationum</i> or the like, has rather better attestation, and: <i>Historia ab initio mundi</i>, etc. (if original in the Munich MSS.) the oldest of all. I can hardly believe, however, that any of them are original; it seems more probable that some Biblical name was prefixed to the book when it was first issued. Rather out of respect to the first editor than for any better reason I have retained the title <i>Biblical Antiquities</i>, under which the text was introduced to the modern world.</p>
 <p>The ATTRIBUTION TO PHILO I regard as due to the accident that the text was transmitted in company with genuine Philonic writings. <a name="fr_9"></a><a href="bap06.htm#fn_9"><font size="1">1</font></a> Certainly, if the <i>Antiquities</i> had come down to us by themselves, no one in his senses could have thought of connecting them with Philo; unless, indeed, knowing of but two Jewish authors, Philo and Josephus, he assumed that, since one had written a history of the Jews, the other must needs have followed suit.</p>
