  XI. <i>And in the 3rd month of the journeying of the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt, they came into the wilderness of Sinai</i>. And God remembered his word and said: I will give light unto the world, and lighten the habitable places, and make my covenant with the children of men, and glorify my people above all nations, for unto them will I put forth an eternal exaltation <a name="fr_53"></a><a href="#fn_53"><font size="1">1</font></a> which shall be unto them a light, but unto the ungodly a chastisement. 2. And he said unto Moses: Behold, I will call thee to-morrow: be thou ready and tell my people: "For three days let not a man come near his wife," and on the 3rd day I will speak unto thee and unto them, and after that thou shalt come up unto me. And I will put my words in thy mouth and thou shalt enlighten my people. For I have given into thy hands an everlasting law whereby I will judge all the world. For this shall be for a testimony. For if men say: "We have not known thee, <a name="fr_54"></a><a href="#fn_54"><font size="1">2</font></a> and therefore we have not served

 <p>3. And Moses did as God commanded him, and </p><table align="RIGHT" width="10%" cellpadding="8">

  sanctified the people and said unto them: <i>Be ye ready on the 3rd day</i>, for after 3 days will God make his covenant with you. And the people were sanctified. 4. <i>And it came to pass on the 3rd day</i> <table align="RIGHT" width="10%" cellpadding="8">

  <i>that, lo, there were voices of thunderings (lit. them that sounded) and brightness of lightnings and the voice of instruments sounding aloud. And there was fear upon all the people that were in the camp. And Moses put forth the people to meet God</i>. 5.  <a name="fr_55"></a><a href="#fn_55"><font size="1">1</font></a> And behold the mountains burned with fire and the earth shook and the hills were removed and the mountains overthrown: the depths boiled, and all the habitable places were shaken: and the heavens were folded up and the clouds drew up water. And flames of fire shone forth and thunderings and lightnings were multiplied and winds and tempests made a roaring: the stars were gathered together and the angels ran before, until God established the law of an everlasting covenant with the children of Israel, and gave unto them an eternal commandment which should not pass away.

For, lo, to-day we know that God speaketh with man face to face, and man shall live. And now have we perceived of a truth how that the earth bare the voice of God with trembling. And Moses said unto them: Fear not, <a href="errata.htm#0">for</a> this cause came this voice unto you, that ye should not sin (or, for this cause, that he might prove. you, God came unto you, that ye might receive the fear of him unto you, that ye sin not). 15. <i>And all the people</i> <table align="RIGHT" width="10%" cellpadding="8">

Also he commanded him concerning the tabernacle and the ark of the Lord, and the sacrifice of burnt offerings and of incense, and the ordinance of the table and of the candlestick and concerning the laver and the base thereof, and the shoulder-piece and the breastplate, and the very precious stones, that the children of Israel should make them so: and he shewed him the likeness of them to make them according to the pattern which he saw. And said unto him: Make for me a sanctuary and the tabernacle of my glory shall be among you.</p>

In either case the Law is meant.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_54"></a><a href="bap27.htm#fr_54">106:2</a> 2. <i>If men say</i>, "<i>we have not known thee</i>," etc. Compare <a name="page_107"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 107</font></a> the injunction to the Apostles in a fragment of the <i>Preaching of Peter</i>: "After twelve years go forth into the world, lest any say, 'we did not hear.'"</p>
 <p><a name="fn_55"></a><a href="bap27.htm#fr_55">107:1</a> 5. Similar lists of the wonders which accompanied the giving of the Law are in XV. 6, XXIII. 10, XXXII. 7, 8.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_56"></a><a href="bap27.htm#fr_56">108:1</a> 8. The gloss on the 4th Commandment, as Dr. Cohn says, shows that the writer has little interest in the Temple services, and is appropriate to a time when those services had ceased. It is rather the Synagogue and its ritual that occur to him as the obvious form of worship. The words are adapted from Ps. cvii. 32.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_57"></a><a href="bap27.htm#fr_57">108:2</a> <i>all things that do labour</i>: <i>quaecunque oberantur</i>.</p>

The statement that the tree of life sweetened the waters of Marah, and that these were the waters that followed Israel, are both peculiar to this book. For Marah the MSS. seen by me read <i>myrrha</i>, but the Fulda MS. has <i>myrra</i>; it is Μεῤῥα in the LXX.</p>
