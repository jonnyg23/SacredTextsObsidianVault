 <p align="center"><small><i>His Burial</i>.</small></p>  
 <p>THE Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and <i>that</i> they might be taken away.</p>  
 <p></p>  
 <p>2 Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him.</p>  
 <p>3 But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:</p>  
 <p>4 But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.</p>  
 <p>5 ¶ And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave <i>him</i> leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus.</p>  
 <p>6 And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound <i>weight</i>.</p>  
 <p>7 Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.</p>  
 <p>8 Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein never man yet laid.</p>  
 <p>9 There laid they Jesus: and rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.</p>    </center></body>
