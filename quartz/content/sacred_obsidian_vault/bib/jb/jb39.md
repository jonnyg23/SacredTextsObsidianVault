 <p>AND it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, that they watched him.</p>  
 <p>2 And, behold, there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy.</p>  
 <p>3 And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?</p>  
 <p>4 And they held their peace. And he took him, and healed him, and let him go;</p>  
 <p>5 And answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day?</p>  
 <p>6 And they could not answer him again to these things.</p>
