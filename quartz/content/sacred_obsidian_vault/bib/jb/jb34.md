 <p>JESUS went unto the mount of Olives.</p>  
 <p>2 And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.</p>  
 <p>3 And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,</p>  
 <p>4 They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.</p>  
 <p>5 Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned; but what sayest thou?</p>  
 <p>6 This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with <i>his</i> finger wrote on the ground, <i>as though he heard them not</i>.</p>  
 <p>7 So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.</p>  
 <p>8 And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.</p>

 <p>9 And they which heard <i>it</i>, being convicted by <i>their own</i> conscience, went out one by one beginning at the eldest, <i>even</i> unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.</p>  
 <p>10 When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?</p>  
 <p>11 She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee; go, and sin no more.</p>
