 <p align="center"><small><i>Parable of the Unjust Steward</i>.</small></p>  
 <p>AND he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_100"><font size="1" color="green">p. 100</font></a></p>  
 <p>2 And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward.</p>  
 <p>3 Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed.</p>  
 <p>4 I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.</p>  
 <p>5 So he called every one of his lord's debtors <i>unto him</i>, and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?</p>  
 <p>6 And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.</p>  
 <p>7 Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore.</p>  
 <p>8 And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely; for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.</p>

 <p>9 And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.</p>  
 <p>10 He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.</p>  
 <p>11 If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true <i>riches?</i></p>  
 <p>12 And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?</p>  
 <p>13 No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</p>  
 <p>14 ¶ And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.</p>  
 <p>15 And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.</p>
