 <p align="center"><small><i>The Faithful and Wise Servant</i>.</small></p>  
 <p>WHO then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?</p>  
 <p>2 Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.</p>  
 <p>3 Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his goods.</p>  
 <p>4 But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming;</p>  
 <p>5 And shall begin to smite <i>his</i> fellow-servants, and to eat and drink with the drunken;</p>  
 <p>6 The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for <i>him</i>, and in an hour that he is not aware of,</p>  
 <p>7 And shall cut him asunder, and appoint <i>him</i> his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>
