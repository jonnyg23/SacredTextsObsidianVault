 <p align="center"><small><i>The Two Commandments</i>.</small></p>  
 <p>AND one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?</p>  
 <p><a name="page_128"><font size="1" color="green">p. 128</font></a></p>  
 <p>2 And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments <i>is</i>, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:</p>  
 <p>3 And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this <i>is</i> the first commandment.</p>  
 <p>4 And the second <i>is</i> like, <i>namely</i> this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.</p>  
 <p>5 On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</p>  
 <p>6 And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:</p>  
 <p>7 And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love <i>his</i> neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.</p>
