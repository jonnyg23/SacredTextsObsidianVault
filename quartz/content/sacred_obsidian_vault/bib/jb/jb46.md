 <p align="center"><small><i>Parables of the Widow and Judge, the Pharisee and Publican</i>.</small></p>  
 <p>AND he spake a parable unto them <i>to this end</i>, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;</p>  
 <p>2 Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man:</p>  
 <p>3 And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.</p>  
 <p>4 And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man,</p>  
 <p>5 Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_107"><font size="1" color="green">p. 107</font></a></p>  
 <p>6 And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith.</p>  
 <p>7 And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them?</p>  
 <p>8 I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?</p>  
 <p>9 ¶ And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:</p>  
 <p>10 Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.</p>  
 <p>11 The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee that I am not as other men <i>are</i>, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.</p>  
 <p>12 I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.</p>  
 <p>13 And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as <i>his</i> eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_108"><font size="1" color="green">p. 108</font></a></p>  
 <p>14 I tell you, this man went down to his house justified <i>rather</i> than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</p>
