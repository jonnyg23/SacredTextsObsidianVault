 <p align="center"><small><i>Parable of the Tares</i>.</small></p>  
 <p>ANOTHER parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field.</p>  
 <p>2 But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.</p>  
 <p>3 But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_62"><font size="1" color="green">p. 62</font></a></p>  
 <p>4 So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?</p>  
 <p>5 He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?</p>  
 <p>6 But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.</p>  
 <p>7 Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.</p>  
 <p>8 if Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.</p>  
 <p>9 He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;</p>  
 <p>10 The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked <i>one;</i></p>  
 <p><a name="page_63"><font size="1" color="green">p. 63</font></a></p>  
 <p>11 The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.</p>  
 <p>12 As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.</p>  
 <p>13 The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity.</p>  
 <p>14 And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</p>  
 <p>15 Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>  
 <p>16 ¶ Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.</p>  
 <p>17 ¶ Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:</p>  
 <p>18 Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_64"><font size="1" color="green">p. 64</font></a></p>  
 <p>19 ¶ Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:</p>  
 <p>20 Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.</p>  
 <p>21 So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,</p>  
 <p>22 And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</p>  
 <p>23 Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea, Lord.</p>  
 <p>24 Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe <i>which is</i> instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man <i>that is</i> an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure <i>things</i> new and old.</p>
