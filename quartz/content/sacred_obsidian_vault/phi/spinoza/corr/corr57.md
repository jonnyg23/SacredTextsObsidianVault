 <p>[<i>A continuation of the arguments in favour of ghosts, which may be summarized as follows:I say a thing is done by chance, when it has not been the subject of will on the part of the doer; not when it might never have happened.Necessity and freedom, not necessity and chance, are contraries.If we do not in some sense attribute human qualities to God, what meaning can we attach to the term?You ask for absolute proof of the existence of spirits; such proof is not obtainable for many things, which are yet firmly believed.Some things are more beautiful intrinsically than others.As God is a spirit, spirits resemble Him more than embodied creatures do.A ghost cannot be conceived as clearly as a triangle: can you say that your own idea of God is as clear as your idea of a triangle?As a circle exists without a sphere, so a sphere exists without a circle.We call things higher or lower in proportion to their distance from the earth.All the Stoics, Pythagoreans, and Platonists, Empedocles, Maximus Tyrius, Apuleius, and others, bear witness to ghosts; and no modern denies them</i>.</p>
