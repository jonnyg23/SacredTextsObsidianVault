 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>A Theologico-Political Treatise</i>, by Benedict de Spinoza, [1883], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">TABLE OF CONTENTS</h3>  <h3 align="center">Part 2—Chapters VI to X</h3>  
 <p align="center">CHAPTER VI—Of Miracles.</p>  
 <p>Confused ideas of the vulgar on the subject.</p>  
 <p>A miracle in the sense of a contravention of natural laws an absurdity.</p>  
 <p>In the sense of an event, whose cause is unknown, less edifying than an event better understood.</p>  
 <p>God's providence identical with the course of nature. How Scripture miracles may be interpreted.</p>  
 <p align="center">CHAPTER VII—Of the Interpretation of Scripture.</p>  
 <p>Current systems of interpretation erroneous.</p>  
 <p>Only true system to interpret it by itself.</p>  
 <p>Reasons why this system cannot now be carried out in its entirety.</p>  
 <p>Yet these difficulties do not interfere with our understanding the plainest and most important passages.</p>  
 <p>Rival systems examined—that of a supernatural faculty being necessary—refuted.</p>  
 <p>That of Maimonides.</p>  
 <p>Refuted.</p>  
 <p>Traditions of the Pharisees and the Papists rejected.</p>  
 <p align="center">CHAPTER VIII.—Of the authorship of the Pentateuch,</p>  
 <p>and the other historical books of the Old Testament.</p>  
 <p>The Pentateuch not written by Moses.</p>  
 <p>His actual writings distinct.</p>  
 <p>Traces of late authorship in the other historical books.</p>  
 <p>All the historical books the work of one man.</p>  
 <p>Probably Ezra.</p>  
 <p>Who compiled first the book of Deuteronomy.</p>  
 <p>And then a history, distinguishing the books by the names of their subjects.</p>  
 <p align="center">CHAPTER IX.—Other questions about these books.</p>  
 <p>That these books have not been thoroughly revised and made to agree.</p>  
 <p>That there are many doubtful readings.</p>  
 <p>That the existing marginal notes are often such.</p>  
 <p>The other explanations of these notes refuted.</p>  
 <p>The hiatus.</p>  
 <p align="center">CHAPTER X.—An Examination of the remaining books of</p>  
 <p>the Old Testament according to the preceding method.</p>  
 <p>Chronicles, Psalms, Proverbs.</p>  
 <p>Isaiah, Jeremiah.</p>  
 <p>Ezekiel, Hosea.</p>  
 <p>Other prophets, Jonah, Job.</p>  
 <p>Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther.</p>  
 <p>The author declines to undertake a similar detailed examination of the New Testament.</p>
