 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>A Theologico-Political Treatise</i>, by Benedict de Spinoza, [1883], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">TABLE OF CONTENTS</h3>  <h4 align="center">Part III—Chapters XI to XV</h4>  
 <p align="center">CHAPTER XI—An Inquiry whether the Apostles wrote their</p>  
 <p>Epistles as Apostles and Prophets, or merely as Teachers, and an Explanation of what is meant by Apostle.</p>  
 <p>The epistles not in the prophetic style.</p>  
 <p>The Apostles not commanded to write or preach in particular places.</p>  
 <p>Different methods of teaching adopted by the Apostles.</p>  
 <p align="center">CHAPTER XII—Of the true Original of the Divine Law,</p>  
 <p>and wherefore Scripture is called Sacred, and the Word of God. How that, in so far as it contains the Word of God, it has come down to us uncorrupted.</p>  
 <p align="center">CHAPTER XIII—It is shown, that Scripture teaches only very Simple Doctrines,</p>  
 <p>such as suffice for right conduct.</p>  
 <p>Error in speculative doctrine not impious—nor knowledge pious. Piety consists in obedience.</p>  
 <p align="center">CHAPTER XIV—Definitions of Faith, the True Faith, and the Foundations of Faith, which is once for all separated from Philosophy.</p>  
 <p>Danger resulting from the vulgar idea of faith.</p>  
 <p>The only test of faith obedience and good works.</p>  
 <p>As different men are disposed to obedience by different opinions, universal faith can contain only the simplest doctrines.</p>  
 <p>Fundamental distinction between faith and philosophy—the key-stone of the present treatise.</p>  
 <p align="center">CHAPTER XV—Theology is shown not to be subservient to</p>  
 <p>Reason, nor Reason to Theology: a Definition of the reason which enables us to accept the Authority of the Bible.</p>  
 <p>Theory that Scripture must be accommodated to Reason—maintained by Maimonides—already refuted in Chapter vii.</p>  
 <p>Theory that Reason must be accommodated to Scripture—maintained by Alpakhar—examined.</p>  
 <p>And refuted.</p>  
 <p>Scripture and Reason independent of one another.</p>  
 <p>Certainty, of fundamental faith not mathematical but moral.</p>  
 <p>Great utility of Revelation.</p>  
 <p>Authors Endnotes to the Treatise.</p>
