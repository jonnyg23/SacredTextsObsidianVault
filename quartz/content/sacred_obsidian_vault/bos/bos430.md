                               CELTIC CIRCLE DANCE 
                        copyright 1984 W. J. Bethancourt III 
                          recorded: CELTIC CIRCLE DANCE 
                                    WTP-0002 
                        tune: Same Old Man/Leatherwing Bat 
              
                 Hi said the Norn, sittin in the sand 
                 once I talked to a great Grey Man 
                 spun three times and said with a sigh 
                 "Hadn't been for the Runes had his other eye!" 
              
              Chorus: hi diddle i diddle i day 
                     hi diddle i diddle i diddle ay 
                     hi di diddle i diddle i day 
                     fol the dink a dum diddle do di day 
              
                 Hi said the Lady, dressed in green 
                 prettiest thing I've ever seen 
                 she went down underneath the hill 
                 and came back out of her own free will 
              
                 Brian Boru, on Irish ground 
                 walked three times the Island round 
                 Norsemen came lookin for a fight 
                 just another Irish Saturday night! 
              
                 Hi said Lugh on the banquest night 
                 a poet and a player and a good wheelwright 
                 a harper and a warrior and none the least: 
                 a Druid and he got in to the Feast! 
              
                 Harold Haardrada's face was red! 
                 Came to Britain and he wound up dead 
                 Stamford Bridge is where he's found 
                 got six feet of English ground 
              
                 The Legion with it's Eagles bright 
                 marched into the Pictish night 
                 met them there upon the sand 
                 gave em up to the Wicker Man! 
              
                 Eight-legged steed and hound of Hel 
                 the one-eyed Man, he loves ya well 
                 fire burn and fire spark 
                 are you then feared of the dark? 
              
                 The Circle forms, the Circle flows 
                 the Circle goes where no man knows 
                 Hail to the Lady, one in three: 
                 Present is Past and Past is Me! 
              
                 Rhiannon's Birds are still in flight 
                 all thru the Day all thru the Night 
                 Hail to the Lady, one in Three 
                 Present is Past and Past is Thee! 
              
 
                                            1922
