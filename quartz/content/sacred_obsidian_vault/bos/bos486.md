                                     SPIRITUALITY
 
                  "What is `spirituality'? Does it matter much today?
           And what is something `sacred'? Is it black and white...or grey?"
             These were the queries of a youngster, and gave me pause for
                                       thought;
            And as I rummaged through my mind, I found the words I sought.
             "Spirituality is a relationship 'twixt the Universe and you,
               And how you behave will manifest, no matter what you do!
 
             It's a friendship with creation - with stones and plants and
                                        trees,
              With birds and deer and butterflies...and even bumblebees;
            It's knowing that the life you have, is found in them, as well;
                 It's awareness that creation is found in every realm,
                 And that all of it is sacred and all of it's divine!
               That means it's very special - and will be for all time!
 
           The answers to your questions are both black and white, and grey,
              As spirituality and sacredness depends on you...each day!"
                I pondered well his queries as he slipped out the door,
            And wondered if I'd answered well - or if I should say more...
                  But looking out the window, I saw him smile at me,
             And knew that I'd said plenty, as he reached out and hugged a
                                         tree!
