                           Charge of the God 1 
                              By: Siobhan

 Here's something I picked up recently. The writer felt that there should
 be a Charge of the God to go with The Charge of the Goddess.
                 *****
      Listen the the words of the Great Father, who of old was called
 Osiris, Adonis, Zeus, Thor, Pan, Cernunnos, Herne, Lugh and by may other
 names:
     "My Law is Harmony with all things.  Mine is the secret that opens
 the gates of life and mine is the dish of salt of the earth that is the
 body of Cernunnos that is the eternal circle of rebirth.  I give the
 knowledge of life everlasting, and beyond death I give the promise of
 regeneration and renewal.  I am the sacrifice, the father of all things,
 and my protection blankets the earth."
      Hear the words of the dancing God, the music of whose laughter
 stirs the winds, whose voice calls the seasons:
     "I who am the Lord of the Hunt and the Power of the Light, sun among
 the clouds and the secret of the flame, I call upon your bodies to arise
 and come unto me.  For I am the flesh of the earth and all it's beings.
 Thru me all things must die and with me are reborn.  Let my worship be
 in the body that sings, for behold all acts of willing sacrifice are my
 rituals.  Let there be desire and fear, anger and weakness, joy and
 peace, awe and longing within you.  For these too are part of the
 mysteries found within yourself, within me, all beginnings have endings,
 and all endings have beginnings."
 So Mote It BE!
 
                           Charge of the God 2 
                              By: Siobhan 
                           Tue 12 Jul 94 10:33
 
 This is the second Charge of the God I have.
                 ****
 
 THE CHARGE OF THE GOD
 
 Listen to the words of the God, who is the son, brother, lover, and
 consort of the Lady:
 
 I am the fleet deer in the forest, I am the beach which receives the
 waves, I am the sun which warms the earth. I am the Lord of the
 Spiral Dance of Life, Death and Rebirth, the gentle reaper, the
 Winter stag and the Spring fawn. All things are of me, for I am of
 the Goddess, opposite, yet not opposing. I bring birth forth from the
 womb that is a tomb, for I am the seed which fertilizes. I am
 abundant Life, for I am the grain that grows and I am death, the
 harvest in the Fall. And I am rebirth after darkness, for I am the
 seed that springs forth anew.
 
 I am fertility, the spreader of Life, and I am the Lord of Death,
 which adds value to life.
 
 I am the Guardian of the gate between Life and Death. I am King of
 the Underworld, where no living being may venture, but I am also
 the King of Rebirth, turning the tomb into a womb.

 I bring love and strength, peace and passion, hope and joy, for I am
 the gentle lover in the night.
 
 All that I am comes from the Great Mother, the Divine Star
 Goddess, who is Mother of us all.
 
                 **********
 
 Feel free to use this one as is, or to adapt it in whatever way feels
 right to you.
 
 Blessed Be!

 If you like it, snag it and use it. :-)
