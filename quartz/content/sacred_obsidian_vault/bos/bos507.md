                      BEDLAM BELLS                                  
                            -Joe Bethancourt  
          (c) copyright 1992 W.J. Bethancourt III
          (Tune: "Mad Maudlin" aka "Tom O'Bedlam")
                                         
  Written as a theme song for the Bedlam Bells Morris dance troupe, and
          originally improvised at WesterCon 45, Phoenix, AZ.
                                         
  Tune guitar: DADGBD                    
                                         
              Out upon the Borderlands   
              I've watched the stars a-falling 
              I've drunk deep from Mad River and 
              I've heard my soul a-calling 
                                         
 CHORUS:   Still I sing bonny bells, bonny mad bells,
           Bedlam Bells are bonny!       
           For we all go bare and we live by the air
           And we want your drink and money!
                                         
  I now repent that ever                 My staff hath murder'd giants 
  Myself was so disdain-ed               My bells can call the thunder!
  My wits are lost since me I cros't     I stamp my feet and tread the dance
  Which makes me go thus chain-ed        And split the sky in sunder!
                                         
  To find our wits in Bordertown,      My horn is made of Elven-blades, 
  Ten thousand years we'll travel      I stole it cross the Border!
  And maudlin go on dancing toes,      The rainbow there is this I wear 
  To save our shoes from gravel        For my wits are out of order!
                                         
  I crossed into fair Elfland            I went to Digger's Kitchen 
  To find the soul I'd squandered        To beg some food one morning
  To hunt my sighs in children's eyes    I got my dreams served piping hot
  But still my soul had wandered         And saw a city burning
                                         
  I had an Elfin lady,                     I'll wander thru the Borderlands
  And took her for to wife me              With feathers in my hair-o
  She sleeps the day, she sings the night  With my true love close to my side
  And hearkens to delight me!              And back and sides go bare-o!
                                         
  Both in and out of Bordertown      I'll dance the day, I'll dance the night
  I've drank Mad River's water       And spend my time a-singing
  And stood upon the Bridge O'Dread  Dance out the old, ring in the new
  And watched the sudden slaughter!  With Bedlam Bells a-ringing!
                                         
              Take a drink for Tom of Bedlam
              Take a drink from the river's water!
              And speak in sighs from darkened eyes
              And court the River's daughter!
                                         
                             *           
                                         
 
 
 
                                         
                         *               
                                                                             2292
