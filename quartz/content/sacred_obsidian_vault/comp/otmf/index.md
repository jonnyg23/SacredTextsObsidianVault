 This monograph by Max Müller is a classic study of East 
 to West migration of folk stories.
 He sets it up with a detailed study of the fable known to us
 as the Milkmaid and the Spilt Milk.
 This is the same theme expressed by the proverb 'Do not count
 your chickens before they are hatched.'
 He traces this all the way back to the <cite>Panchatantra</cite>,
 complete with a detailed historical flowchart.
 </p>
 <p>
 Müller then gives a second example: the fable of Barlaam and Josaphat.
 Barlaam was a (possibly legendary) dark-ages saint.
 Müller demonstrates that this tale matches the narrative of the
 Birth Story of the Buddha, as found in the <cite>Lalita Vistara</cite>.
 So, ironically, the Buddha ended up as a Catholic saint, with his
 own day, November 27th!

 This classic (and still controversial) paper is required reading for any
 students of comparative religion or folklore.--J.B. Hare, December 5th, 2009.
