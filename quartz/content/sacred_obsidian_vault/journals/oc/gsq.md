 <h2 align="center">THE GOSPEL SOURCE Q.</h2>
 
 <p>   <small>[Professor Wellhausen has discovered that both Matthew and Luke have used in addition to the Gospel of Mark another source (<i>Quelle</i>) which he designates by the initial Q, a name which has been generally adopted by theologians. The reconstruction here presented is according to Harnack.</small></p>
 
 <p>   <small>The numbers which appear at the beginning of each fragment are the designations by which they are now referred to in theological literature. They follow upon the whole the order of Luke.]</small></p>

 <p>   (When from all the region around Jordan John saw many [or: the multitudes] coming to baptism, he said unto them): O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance; and think not [begin not] to say within yourselves: We have Abraham to our father, for I say unto you that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham. And now the axe is laid unto the root of the trees; therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire. I baptize you with water unto repentance; but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear; he shall baptize you with (the [Holy] Ghost and) with fire; whose fan is in his hand, and he will througly purge his floor, and gather his wheat unto the garner, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.</p>

 <p>   Jesus was led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil, and when he had fasted forty days and forty nigh he was afterward an hungered, and the tempter said to him: If

 <a name="page_619"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 619</font></a>
 
 thou be the Son of God, command that these stones become bread, and he answered: It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone. Then he taketh him up to Jerusalem and setteth him on the pinnacle of the temple, and saith to him: If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down; for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee, and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone. Jesus said to him: Again it is written, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. Again he taketh him up unto an exceeding high mountain and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them; and said unto him: All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt worship me. And Jesus saith unto him: It is written, The Lord thy God shalt thou worship and him only shalt thou serve. And the devil leaveth him.</p>

 <p>   I say unto you: Love your enemies and pray for them which persecute you, that ye may be the sons of your Father, for he maketh the sun to rise on the evil and on the good (and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust).

 <p>   Judge not, that ye be not judged; for with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged; and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again. And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Or how wilt thou say to thy brother: Let me cast out the mote out of thine eye; and behold, a beam is in thine own eye?

 <p>   The tree is known by the fruit. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit, but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.</p>

 <p>   (Not everyone that saith unto me: Lord, Lord! shall enter into the kingdom of God, but he that doeth the will of the Father.) Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them, I will shew you whom he is like. He is like (or in place of the last; twelve words: He shall be likened) unto a man which built his house upon a rock. And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat upon that house, and it fell not; for it was founded upon a rock. And every one that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a man which built his house upon the sand. And the rain descended and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat upon that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it.</p>

 <p>   Therefore I say unto you: Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat and the body more than raiment? Behold the ravens (or: the fowls of the air); for they sow not, neither do they reap nor gather into barns; yet God feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they? Which of you by taking thought can add one

 cubit unto his stature? and why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies, how they grow? They toil not, neither do they spin; and yet I say unto you (that) even Solomon în all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. Wherefore if God so clothe the grass of the field which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith? Therefore take no thought saying: What shall we eat? or What shall we drink? or Wherewithall shall we be clothed? For after all these things do the nations (of the world) seek; for your Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. But seek ye his kingdom, and all these things shall be added unto you.</p>

 <p>   Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where theives do not break through nor steal; for where thy (your) treasure is, there will thy (your) heart be also.</p>

He saith unto him: I will come and heal him. The centurion answered and said: Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof; but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed. For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me, and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my slave: Do this, and he doeth it. When Jesus heard it he marvelled and said to them that followed, (Verily) I say unto you, Not even in Israel have I found such faith.

 <p>   Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent his disciples and said unto him: Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another? And he answered and said unto them: Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and see, the blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them; and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me. And as they departed, he began to say unto the multitudes concerning John: What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind? But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold they that wear soft clothing are in kings' houses! But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet! For this is he of whom it is written: Behold I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee. (Verily) I say unto you among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John (the Baptist); notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he. . . .</p>

 <p>   The prophets and the law were until John; since that time the kingdom of God suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force (or: From the days of John until now the kingdom of God, etc.: for all the prophets and the law prophesied until John) . . .</p>

 fellows, saying: We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented. For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say: He hath a devil!

The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold a greater than Jonah is here.

Who then is a faithful and wise servant whom his lord hath made ruler over his bousebold to give them meat in due season? Blessed is that servant whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.
