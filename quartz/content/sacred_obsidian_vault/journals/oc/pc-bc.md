 <p>   The basis of our Christ-conception is, first, the Gospel tradition of the character of Jesus, and for certain reasons (into which we need not enter here) we deem the nucleus of it, mainly represented by Mark, historical. There have been incorporated into the Gospel stories, however, certain traits of Christ-conceptions which are older than Jesus. They are ancient reminiscences of saviours, of divine heroes, of God-men, of mediators between God and mankind, of God-incarnations, etc., and from the beginning these notions crystallized with great exuberance around the figure of the Crucified.</p>

 <p>   Now it is a characteristic feature of some pagan saviours that when they have conquered the enemy they enter in triumphal procession and celebrate their marriage feast. This is especially the case of Bel Marduk,<a name="page_450_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_450_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a> the main mediator god of ancient Babylon, who in the faith of his worshipers bears, in many respects, a close resemblance to the Christ of Christianity.</p>
 
 <p>   Since Christianity was tinged with ascetic sentiments especially in the beginning, the marriage idea of Christ has been considerably dimmed, but it was not entirely lost sight of. Not only have we

The bride is Jerusalem representing the Church and the Lamb is Christ.</p>

 <p>   Marduk is in more than one respect comparable to Christ. He is the beloved Son of Ea, the God of Heaven, by whom he is addressed in these words: "My son, what is it that thou dost not

 <p>incarnation of divine wisdom. He is the saviour god, and the saviour king with whose arrival the Golden Age begins on earth. But the most remarkable parallelism obtains between Marduk and Christ in that both rise from the dead and the festival of resurrection

 <a name="page_456"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 456</font></a>
 
 is celebrated for each in the beginning of the natural year in the spring.</p>
 
 <p>   Little is known of Marduk's death, but that he died and descended into the nether world appears from the fact that he bears the name <i>Bel nubatti</i>, "Lord of lamentation" (or as Schrader translates it, "<i>Herr der</i> [<i>Toten</i>-]<i>Klage</i>"), suggesting the assumption that his death was lamented in a similar way as the death of Adonis or other vegetation and solar deities. We further know from Greek sources<a name="page_456_fr_5"></a><a href="#page_456_note_5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></a> (Ctesias XXIX, 21 f.; Ælianus, <i>Var. Hist.</i>) that Xerxes opened and plundered the tomb of Bel, which can only mean the transference of the god's statue from Babylon to some other place, and proves that the temple of Bel contained the tomb of the god, thus implying that there was an annual day of lamentation for his death.</p>
 
 <p>   The Easter festival of Bel coincides with the New Year's day of Babylon, the first of Nisan, and was celebrated under the name</p>

 <p><i>tabû</i>, which Jensen translates by "resurrection" in the sense of the Christian Epiphany. It was the main religious festival of Babylon and in a description of it we read of Marduk: <i>ihis ana hadassutu</i>, "he hastens to wedlock." (Schrader translates, "<i>er eilte zur Brautschaft</i>.") His bride is called Tsarpanitu, which is commonly assumed to be a cognomen of Istar.</p>
 
 <p>   Similar festivals have been celebrated in other cults, e.g., the wedding of Zeus with Hera, of Dionysus with Ariadne, of Eros with Psyche, etc.</p>
 
 <p>   Bel Marduk was replaced among the Persians by Mithras who succeeded to all the honors of the Babylonian god, and in the days of Christianity Christ replaced both.</p>
 
 <p>   In Revelations which preserves a more primitive conception of Christ than the Gospels, and contains more reminiscences of ancient
 
 <!------------------------page 457------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_457"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 457</font></a>
 
 Babylon (as Gunkel has proved) than any other book of the New Testamenent, we read of the marriage feast of the Lamb (<a href="../../bib/kjv/rev.htm#19:7">xix. 7</a>-9):</p>
 
 <p>   "Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honor to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready. And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints. And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God."</p>
 
 <p>   We must remember that the lamb is the New Testament emblem for Christ corresponding to Bel Marduk whose symbol is the ram or male sheep, corresponding also to the ram of Amen Ra. Alexander the Great had a coin struck which pictured him with the horns of a wether announcing himself as the son of the god Ammon in order to indicate that he was the expected king with whose arrival the Golden Age would begin. The word "lamb" in Revelations translates the Greek ἀρνίον which means a little ram conveying the idea of a child, born to be the leader of his people. Our modern idea of a lamb as the symbol of innocence and submission to the butcher is absolutely missing in the original conception of the young ram, and we dare say that the intention of the word is almost the reverse.</p>
 
 <p>   Further down the bride of the lamb is interpreted to be the new city of Jerusalem, which in Christianity again symbolizes the Church. We read<a name="page_457_fr_6"></a><a href="#page_457_note_6"><sup><small>6</small></sup></a>:</p>
 
 <p>   "And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband."</p>
 
 <p>   That the interpretation is later than the original idea of a bride is quite obvious in the Fourth Book of Esdras, where the prophet encounters a woman and listens to the tale of her tribulation. The woman disappears and in her place he beholds a city whereupon the angel Uriel explains the vision saying (4 Esdras x. 44): "The woman which thou hast seen is Sion, which thou now seest before thee as a builded city."</p>
 
 <p>   A similar idea is found in the Wisdom of Solomon where wisdom is personified as Sophia and is spoken of as having existed before the world, taking the place of the Holy Ghost in Christianity. We read for instance in chapters vii and viii:</p>
 
 <p>   "For wisdom is more moving than any motion: she passeth and goeth through all things by reason of her pureness. . . . And
 
 <!------------------------page 458------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_458"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 458</font></a>
 
 being but one, she can do all things: and remaining in herself, she maketh all things new: and in all ages entering into holy souls, she maketh them friends of God, and prophets. For God loveth none but him that dwelleth with wisdom. . . . Wisdom reacheth from one end to another mightily: and sweetly doth she order all things. . . . In that she is conversant with God, she magnifieth her nobility: yea, the Lord of all things himself loved her. For she is privy to the mysteries of the knowledge of God, and a lover of his works."</p>
 
 <p>   Sophia retains this place which she holds in the Old Testament Apocrypha with the Gnostics, and as we know from a fragment of the Gospel According to the Hebrews, the Holy Ghost is regarded as the wife of God the Father, for there Jesus uses the expression "My Mother the Holy Ghost," as quoted by Epiphanius (<i>Haeres</i> LXII, 2).</p>
 
 <p>   The idea of a trinity as God,—father, mother and son—faded away quickly during the early development of the Christian dogma and it seems that the replacement of the word <i>logos</i> for <i>sophia</i> helped to obliterate the idea that the second person of the deity was female. The change was also favored by the fact that while <i>ruah</i>, the Hebrew term for spirit, is feminine, the Greek term <i>pneuma</i> is neuter.</p>
 
 <p>   The craving for a religious reverence of womanhood remained even in the age of asceticism, and found its satisfaction in the worship of the <i>Theotoktos</i>, the mother of God, which is a literal translation of ancient pagan terms, especially the Egyptian <i>neter mut</i>, but in addition the idea of the Saviour's bride though considerably neglected was never entirely forgotten. In the imagination of the people, though rarely ever of the clergy, it remained in a hazy atmosphere of mysticism and finally took a definite shape toward the tenth century by imputing to Jesus a mystical bride who was called Catharine, the "pure one," to indicate that she was an ideal of virginity. The notion of any true wedlock relation was necessarily excluded according to the prevalent asceticism of Church doctrines and so in this fairytale atmosphere the legend of a spiritual marriage of Christ assumed a more and more definite shape.</p>
 
 <p>   The idea of the mystic marriage of Catharine has never found friends among Protestants, and after the rise of the Reformation it became almost disregarded even in the Roman Catholic Church, but it has given us a number of charming and most beautiful pictures which are and will remain cherished by all lovers of art, not excepting Protestants. In the Renaissance it was a favorite subject of the greatest artists such as Murillo, Correggio, Veronese and

 but the bride of Christ was originally St. Catharine of Alexandria. Among other saints of the same name the best known is St. Catharine of Siena, and since the people of Siena did not want to stay behind the Alexaridrians, they too claimed for their saint the honor of a mystic marriage with Christ which has been duly represented in the pictures of the saint's life.</p>
 
 <p>   The popularity of St. Catharine is proved by the frequent occurrence of the name and also by the belief that she belongs to the most powerful intercessors with God. It will be remembered that Jeanne d'Arc believed that she was especially supported by the Virgin Mary, the Archangel Michael and the two saints Margaret and Catharine. Jeanne d'Arc is reported as having obtained the miraculous sword which she used in battle from St. Catharine's chapel at Fierbois, after receiving a divine revelation that it was hidden there.</p>
