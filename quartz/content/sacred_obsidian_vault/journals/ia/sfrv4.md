 <tr><td>Had need not been for worlds, for earth,<br>
 Nothing the Lord of worlds would have produced.<br>
 This earth chaotic stood in need of hills;<br>
 Had this not been, He had not raised majestic ones.<br>
 Had there no need been of the spheres also,<br>
 Seven whirling ones from nought He had not made.<br>
 The Sun, the Moon, and all these stars<br>
 Could not shine forth if not for need.<br>
 Thus need the cause of all existences became.<br>
 The power also of man in need consists,<br>
 Then, needy man, be quick, proclaim your need,<br>
 That bounty's ocean may with mercy boil!<br>
 All mendicants distressed in the world<br>
 Their needs to all men do proclaim—<br>
 Their blindness, poverty, disease, and pain—<br>
 Mankind's pity with their needs to move.<br>
 No one will say:—"Give bread to me, O men!<br>
 Property and barns and stores I do possess."<br>
 God has witheld eyesight from moles<br>
 Because no eyes they need for their support;<br>
 They live and move deprived of vision,<br>
 At ease, though blind, in soil all moist;<br>
 By stealth alone they leave their domicile<br>
 Until their Maker frees them from that stealth,<br>
 With wings endows them,<a name="page_185_fr_*"></a><a href="#page_185_note_*">*</a> makes them birds<br>
 Winging to heaven their angel-flights,<br>
 Alway to dwell in the rose-grove of thanks to God,<br>
 Like philomels to sing a hundred melodies:—<br>
 "O saviour from all wickedness,<br>
 Transforming hell to paradise,<br>
 A greasy ball with light thou hast endowed<br>
 And bones with hearing; O most bountiful!"<br>
 Does intuition with the human frame unite?<br>
 How do all things with names combine?<br>
 Words are but nests, the meanings are the birds,<br>
 Body the bed through which the spirit-river flows.<br>
 The surface of this mental watercourse<br>
 Is not without its chaff of good and bad repute:<br>
 It flows, but you would say it stagnates;<br>
 It moves but you would say it stays;<br>
 From place to place were there no motion<br>
 Whence these renewed supplies of floating chaff?<br>
 That chaff is but an image of the mind,<br>
 Assuming every moment a new shape;<br>
 Like chaff its likes and dislikes float away;<br>
 The husks upon the surface of this watercourse<br>
 Come from transmundane garden's fruits,—<br>
 The kernels of those husks in yonder garden seek.<br>
 The water from that garden to the river flows;<br>
 If you your life's departure cannot see,<br>
 Behold in the waters this floating of the plants.<br></td></tr>

 <h3 align="center"><a name="pp_2"></a>LUST OF DOMINION.</h3>
 
 <p align="center"><i>Translated from the Mesnavi of Jellâl aldyn-Rûmi.</i></p>
 
 <table align="center" cellpadding="10">
 
 <tr><td>All pride and pain with lust begins,<br>
 But habit will establish lust.<br>
 When custom has your humours fixed<br>
 Him you hate who draweth you away;<br>
 If you an earth-eater have become,<br>
 Who pulls your earth away your foe will be;<br>
 When idol worshippers to statues get attached<br>
 Him they hate who idols doth forbid.<br>
 When Eblis wished a prince to be,<br>
 Adam he feigned to despise:<br>
 "Was this a better prince than me,<br>
 Worshipped to be by one like me?"<a name="page_186_fr_*"></a><a href="#page_186_note_*">*</a><br>
 Dominion poison is, except to Him<br>
 Who cures all evils from the first;<br>
 Fear not a mountain full of snakes,<br>
 The antidote it certainly contains.<br>
 Give way to pride's dominion,<br>
 Who breaks it will your hatred earn;<br>
 No matter who would thwart your wish,<br>
 He will encounter darts of wrath.<br>
 Who means to weed my humours out<br>
 Usurps dominion over me.<br>
 Had he no evil pride in him,<br>
 Could fire of strife inflame his mind?<br>
 Had evil nature not got root,<br>
 How could the flame of opposition blaze?<br>
 Does he his foe conciliate?<br>
 Will he enshrine him in his heart<br>
 Because his evil humour has no root?<br>
 The ant of lust, habit a serpent made;<br>
 O kill the snake of lust at first,<br>
 Or else a dragon will your snake become;<br>
 But all mistake their snakes for ants!<br>
 Do you from sages take advice.<br></td></tr>

 <p align="center"><i>From the Mesnavi of Jellâl-aldyn Rûmi, 3rd Duftur.</i></p>
 
 <table align="center" cellpadding="10">
 
 <tr><td>Man feeds on blood as embryo,<br>
 Believers thus by dirt get pure!<br>
 Whilst in the womb, man feeds on blood,<br>
 His warp and woof of blood consists;<br>
 When weaned of blood he milk consumes;<br>
 He morsels eats when weaned of milk;<br>
 But weaned of morsels Lokmân<a name="page_219_fr_*"></a><a href="#page_219_note_*">*</a> he becomes,<br>
 Investigates things hidden and revealed.<br>
 Were one to say to embryos in the womb:—<br>
 "Without, there is a well-arranged world,<br>
 An earth quite joyous, long and broad,<br>
 Of blessings full, and various food;<br>
 With mountains, lakes, and prairies green,<br>
 Parks, gardens, cultivated fields,<br>
 The firmament so high and bright,<br>
 The sun, the moon, with hundred winds,<br>
 Zephyrs from north and south and west,<br>
 With gardens, banquets, nuptials,—<br>
 Its wonders cannot be described.<br>
 How tried you are in this darkness!<br>
 Blood you consume in this closet,<br>
 In dirt and misery confined;"<br>
 It would deny its state and case,<br>
 Reject this message with full force<br>
 As false, deceit, impossible.<br>
 It has no sense, but understanding blind<br>
 Its mind cannot conceive the thing,—<br>
 The negative mind hearing scorns.<br>
 Just such the crowd is in this nether world<br>
 When Abdâls<a name="page_219_fr_dagger"></a><a href="#page_219_note_dagger">†</a> moot the world beyond:—<br>
 "This world is but a narrow and dark well;<br>
 Without, the immaterial world exists."<br>
 Such words their ears will not accept,—<br>
 A hope like this is thickly veiled;<br>
 Present enjoyments plug the ear,<br>
 The eye is dimmed by interests;<br>
 Just as the embryo's greed for blood,<br>
 Which was its food in womb's dark cave,<br>
 Concealed from it the present world,<br>
 The body's blood to it endeared;<br>
 Thus, unaware of blessings all,<br>
 No other nourishment it had but blood.<br>
 Man's lust for joys of present life<br>
 Eternal joys has veiled from him.<br>
 Your greed for this deceitful life<br>
 From true life has removed you;<br>
 Be quite aware that lust is blinding you,<br>
 Concealing certainty from you.<br>
 Truth false appears to you from greed,<br>
 Which hundredfold is blinding you.<br>
 Oh, free yourself from greed, like all just men,<br>
 That you your foot on that threshold may place,<br>
 And saved be on entering the gate<br>
 From all terrestrial joys and griefs;<br>
 Your soul's eye bright and true will see,<br>
 Unsoiled by unbelief, the light of Faith.<br>
