 <tr><td>When a small sage professed the belief<br>
 That heaven is an egg and earth its yolk,<br>
 An asker asked: "How does the earth abide<br>
 In this great ocean of the firmament,<br>
 A lamp suspended in the welkin vast?<br>
 Does it slide neither down nor up at all?"<br>
 The sage replied: "The attraction of the sky<br>
 From all directions keeps it in the air;<br>
 As dome of loadstone molten standing fair<br>
 Holds iron with itself suspended high."<br>
 The man rejoining said: "Can heaven pure<br>
 Attract this sinful melancholy earth?<br>
 It so repels it from all sides alike<br>
 To fix it amidst awful hurricanes!"<br>
 Thus the aversion of the blessed saints<br>
 In aberration fetters impious men<br>
 In the repulsion of this world and next<br>
 For either hopeful pledges they have none.<br>
 You spite the servants of the Lord Most High<br>
 Because they are aggrieved at your life.<br>
 They possess the electrum and reveal it.<br>
 Then they entice your straw, your nature vile;<br>
 But when their grand electrum they conceal<br>
 Your resignation quickly turns revolt!</td></tr>

 <tr><td>All things attract each other in the world,<br>
 The heat allures the heat, and cold the cold,<br>
 A foolish portion fascinates the fools,<br>
 The well-directed the remainder lure;<br>
 The igneous attract the hell-destined,<br>
 The luminous draw on the sons of light;<br>
 Also the pure attract the immaculate,<br>
 Whilst the melancholy are courting pain;<br>
 The Zangi from the Zangi friendship seeks,<br>
 A Roman with a Roman gently deals.<br>
 With closèd eyes you are dismayed indeed<br>
 Because the light of day rejoiced the eye;<br>
 The eye's assimilation caused your grief,<br>
 It longèd quick to join the light of day.<br>
 If eye again be thus dismayed to you,<br>
 The heart's eye you have closed! Why not indulge<br>
 That heart-proclaiming bent of your two eyes<br>
 Which longs for infinite brilliancy?<br>
 When absence of those mundane fickle lights<br>
 Distressèd you, your eyes you opened!<br>
 Thus separation from eternal lights<br>
 Dismay will bring to you; then cherish them!<br>
 When He calls me I must investigate,<br>
 Am I to be attracted or repelled?</td></tr>

 <tr><td>The wisdom of the Lord by fate destined<br>
 To mutual love this family—mankind,<br>
 All beings must, obeying that command,<br>
 Reciprocal, as loving couples, stand;<br>
 Each couple in this world a pair must want<br>
 Exact as amber with a blade of grass.<br>
 The firmament salutes the earth beneath,<br>
 "I unto thee as iron to the magnet am!"<br>
 The sky is man, and earth his fitting spouse.<br>
 Whate'er the sky throws off, the earth receives;<br>
 When she no heat possesses, he it sends,<br>
 When she no moisture has, dew he presents.<br>
 The spheric sign of earth will earth bestow,<br>
 The aqueous sign humidity will bring,<br>
 The sign of wind will fleeting clouds afford—<br>
 Absorbing noxious vapours of the land;<br>
 The element of fire will heat produce,<br>
 Which issues from the flaming disc—the sun.<br>
 The heaven still rotates for the earth—<br>
 Like the husband for his wife providing.<br>
 This earth a faithful housewife represents,<br>
 Who toileth for the offspring she begat;<br>
 The Lord implanted love in man and wife,<br>
 This unison endues the world with life!</td></tr>

 <tr><td>The dust to body's dust exclaims:—"Return!<br>
 The soul abandon; join us like a rose;<br>
 Thou'rt of our nature and our kind,<br>
 Prefer to leave that body, flee to us!"<br>
 The dust replies:—"My feet are shackled so,<br>
 Although like thee I, separated, groan."<br>
 The moisture of the body waters seek:—<br>
 "Humidity, come back from wand'ring far!"<br>
 The sphere of fire invites the body's heat:—<br>
 "Thou art of fire! Thine origin approach!"<br>
 Maladies seventy-two do bodies feel<br>
 From the attraction of the elements.<br>
 Diseases try to tear the body up,<br>
 That the elements four may separate.<br>
 Four they are, these birds with captive feet,<br>
 But death, disease, and dissolution fell<br>
 Untie the ligatures of the nimble feet;<br>
 And liberate each elemental bird.<br>
 Attraction of these roots and branches great<br>
 Subjects our body every moment to disease,<br>
 That these connections may be severed all,<br>
 And every bird to its original fly!<br>
 But the wisdom of the Lord forbids this haste,<br>
 And keeps them join'd in health till doom arrives.</td></tr>

 Because they both the body did produce.<a name="page_305_fr_*"></a><a href="#page_305_note_*">*</a><br>
 All life and souls the spirit doth attract—<br>
 The universal Spirit gave it birth!<br>
 Science and wisdom fascinate the soul,<br>
 Vineyards and gardens please the body much;<br>
 The soul aspires to virtue and to worth,<br>
 The body groans for wealth and earthly pelf;<br>
 And virtue to the soul inclines with worth:<br>

 Is this attraction human or divine?</td></tr>

 <tr><td>Attraction drives each dancing atom far<br>
 With other atoms to its special sphere,<br>
 It draws the gard'ner to the rosy grove,<br>
 Conveys the coalman to the furnace hot,<br>
 If you the nadir to the zenith scan,<br>
 Exceptions to this law you cannot find;<br>
 In fire, in wind, in earth; in water, not<br>
 Beneath the earth up to the lofty sky,<br>
 The same attraction must govern them all,<br>
 Affection, kindness, sympathy together<br>
 Obey this great governing pow'r divine.<br>
 Besides this impulse nothing is all else:<br>
 From this attraction ev'ry motion seen<br>
 On earth or in the heavens is derived.<br>
 The puny straw obeys the same attraction,<br>
 And clings to the electrum willingly;<br>
 Implanted in each nature is its bent<br>
 Compelling ev'ry man to his pursuit.<br>
 Distracted Mejnun this impulse obeys,<br>
 It hands to La-i-ly his chain to draw,<br>
 Compels Ferhâd for Shyryn to lament,<br>
 Commanding him Mount Bisetún to dig;<br>
 From heat the lamp will be a burning flame<br>
 Which draws the moth its proper doom to seek;<br>
 The bulbul sighing for the rose obeys<br>
 This bent when stung by brambles in his foot.<br>
 When this attraction strength and power gets<br>
 To love it turns, the body permeates.<br>
 Abundance of this feeling so prevails<br>
 That universal love the world maintains;<br>
 At first you nothing see but La-i-ly<br>
 If love's origin you investigate;<br>
 Although a flame a hundred thousand is,<br>
 It is derivèd from a single spark<br>
 From which the greatest conflagrations rise;<br>
 It is its prevalence that fans the flame.<br>
 O let this fiery ardour be in us,<br>
 Its many sparks illuminate our hearts!</td></tr>

There occur figures of speech still more strange and incongruous to our notions; the translator has accordingly omitted four lines here.
