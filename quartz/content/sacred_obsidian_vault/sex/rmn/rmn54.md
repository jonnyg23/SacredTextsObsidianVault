 <p align="CENTER">FRESCO FROM POMPEII.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">PLATE LIII.</p>
 <p>THE subject of this fresco is as ridiculous as the drawing is incorrect. How could a man, whom it is not possible to confound with a rural divinity, be thus in the open fields, in a complete state of nudity? or would he have dreamt, in such a place, of putting his mistress in the state, by removing her single garment? In this painting probability receives too great a shock, added to which the woman is twisting her neck in a horrible fashion to receive her lover's kisses.</p>
 <p>These kind of obscene paintings (<i>Spinthriæ</i>) are frequently referred to by Latin authors. Here are two examples taken at random:--</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>The hand that first in naked colours traced<br>
 Groups of loose lovers on walls that once were chaste<br>
 And full exposed, broad burning on the light<br>
 The shapes and postures that abash the sight<br>
 Made artless minds in crime's refinements wise,<br>
 And flash'd enlightening vice on virgin eyes." <a name="fr_55"></a><a href="#fn_55"><font size="1">1</font></a></p></dir>

 <p>"Looking up at a certain painting, in which was represented how Jove was said once to have sent a golden shower into the bosom of Danae." <a name="fr_56"></a><a href="#fn_56"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>
