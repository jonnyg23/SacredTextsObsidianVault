 <p align="CENTER">PLATE XLVII.</p>
 <p>THIS painting is almost a repetition of the preceding one. A young girl, seated astride over her lover, is again playing the chief part. The cubicular slave, on the point of withdrawing from the mysterious chamber, turns round and casts a lascivious look on the two lovers. He bears a dish, upon which nothing is seen, and which probably contained the aphrodisiac aliments of which the two actors have made use.</p>
 <p>The bed, simple in form, appears to be of bronze. There are several similar ones in the museum of Naples. They were found at Herculaneum and Pompeii.</p>
 <p>Under the bed may be observed a stool.</p>
