 <p align="CENTER">FRESCO FROM POMPEII.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">PLATE XXXVIII.</p>
 <p>THIS fresco was discovered in 1826, at Pompeii. It is supposed that the house where it was found was one of those places of debauchery called <i>lupanaria</i>. In one of the principal rooms of the house may be seen a painting representing some youths and courtezans abandoning to the pleasures of the table and to play: one of the young men, the hero of the fresco we are describing, heated, doubtless, by the fumes of wine, is pursuing a woman. His gestures leave no doubt as to the nature of his intentions; but his fair companion, alarmed at the sight of the prodigious instrument with which he menaces her, seizes her lover by the throat, and endeavours to push him back: she even seems on the point of hurling at his head a vase which she holds in her right hand.</p>
 <p>The drawing of this fresco presents several imperfections, and the youth's left arm, though meant to be foreshortened, is evidently not long enough.</p>
 <p>We mentioned in our Introduction that the Greeks called these sort of paintings <i>grylli</i>, and the Romans <i>libidines</i>. They were designated by a</p>

 <p>more emphatic expression when they were more than usually indecorous, viz., <i>Spinthria</i> (debauchery), from σπινθὴρ, a spark. We shall henceforth make use of this term, as more appropriate to the paintings which remain to be described.</p>
