 <h2 align="center">Preface</h2>
 
 <p>It was, I believe, in the winter of 1915-16 that a woman-friend in California wrote and asked me why I did not write a special little book on Karezza.</p>
 
 <p>As events had convinced me that there certainly was crying need of instruction on the matter, her suggestion took root and this small brochure is the fruit.</p>
 
 <p>For though quite a number have written more or less concerning controlled intercourse, they have usually done so guardedly and so vaguely that to the average inquirer the subject remains a mystery and the beginner does not know how to proceed. For which reason most men fail and give up who could just as well succeed. And success or failure here may make all the difference between divorce or a lifetime of love-happiness.
