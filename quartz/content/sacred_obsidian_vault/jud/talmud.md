 <p>
 A search for Talmud at Google will turn up hundreds of thousands
 of hits, a depressing number of which are to anti-Semitic sites.
 However, to our knowledge this is the first extensive
 English translation of the Talmud to be posted on the Internet.
 The Talmud is a vast collection of Jewish laws and traditions.
 Despite the dry subject matter the Talmud makes interesting reading
 because it is infused with vigorous intellectual debate,
 humor and deep wisdom.
 As the saying goes, 'you don't have to be Jewish'
 to appreciate this text.
 If you put in the hard work required to read
 the Talmud, your mind will get a world-class workout.
 The process of studying the Talmud has been compared with the
 practice of Zen Buddhist Koan meditation, and for good reason.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Rodkinsons' ten-book edition, the only extensive one currently
 in the public domain, contains complete translations of the
 'Festivals' and 'Jurisprudence' sections of the Talmud.
 Rodkinson only finished about a third of the Talmud.
 All ten volumes were prepared at Sacred-texts and are available
 here in their entirety.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Rodkinson has been widely criticized, both from traditionalist Jews who
 feel that translating the Talmud is not an acceptable practice,
 as well as from those hostile to the Talmud and Judaism in general.
 As often seems to be the case,
 the political spectrum seems to be a Mobeius loop.
 All of these viewpoints are abundantly represented on the Internet.
 Some quote material out of context, or ascribe hostile
 intent to innocent passages.
 The most hurtful critics are those who claim that Rodkinson deliberately
 left out material to conceal an evil Jewish agenda.
 After completion of this etext, I can unequivocally state
 that this is hogwash.
 Rodkinson's Talmud is, by definition, an abridgement for modern readers.
 He left out only the sections where the debate spins off into complete
 obscurity, and was careful to document where he did so.
 Now that this incredible text, lovingly translated, is on the Internet
 perhaps these criticisms can finally be put to rest.
 </p>
 
 
 <p>
 <i>Bibliographic note on Rodkinsons' Talmud</i><br>
 Rodkinson's translation went through at least two editions.
 The sacred-texts version was prepared from the second edition.
 All of these were from the 1918 printing,
 with the exception of book 1, which was scanned from a 1903 printing.
 The numbering of the volumes changed radically between the first and
 second edition; to add to the confusion the second edition was
 bound into a ten book set, two volumes per book.
 This numbering is consistent, for instance, the second edition 
 book 1 contains volumes 1 and 2;
 book 5 contains volumes 9 and 10, and so on.
 However, the volume sequence of the first edition was completely
 shuffled in the second edition;
 for instance, volumes 9 and 10 of the second edition (in book 5)
 correspond to volumes 1 and 2 of the first edition.
 This confusion will be evident if you shop the used book market for
 individual books of this set (which are fairly abundant at reasonable prices).

 Book 1: <span class="c_t"><a href="t01/index.htm"><!-- The Talmud,  -->Tract Sabbath</a></span><br>
 <span class="c_b">Tract Sabbath discusses what can and cannot be done on the Jewish Holy day.</span>
 This tract has a wealth of information on everyday Jewish life
 in late Classical times, including, for some reason,
 a great number of medical recipes.
 Because almost everything is done differently on the Sabbath, this contains
 an incredible level of ethnographic detail about a wide
 range of household activities including livestock, clothing, meals,
 horticulture, hunting, and other more
 obscure topics, such as fire-fighting and feminine hygiene.
 Rodkinson makes the point in an appendix
 that many of the Talmundic regulations which seem
 to be arbitrary were developed as a response
 to political persecution.
 He also includes a prayer which is offered upon the conclusion of
 studying any tract.

 <span class="c_b">Tracts from section Moed (Festivals).</span>
 Tract Erubin deals with regulations concerning travel on the Sabbath, and the
 proper construction of 'Erub', propitiatory offerings for transgressions
 of these rules, usually, but not always, constructed of food.
 Tract Shekalim deals with tithes.
 Tract Rosh Hashana discusses the Jewish New Year,
 a floating holiday tied to lunar observations.

 <span class="c_b">Continuing with tracts from section Moed (Festivals).</span>
 These are primarily discussions of the rituals to be performed
 on important holy days: principally Passover and the Day of Atonement.
 The short third tract, Hagiga, discusses the Holocaust ceremony,
 (meaning a burnt-offering), which today has come into use as a term
 for the Nazi genocide.
 Among other points of interest is description of the
 ritual of the scapegoat in Chapter VI. of Tract Yomah;
 and Chapter II. of Tract Hagiga
 has a notable digression on a variety of
 subjects, including the cryptic Chariot of God,
 and the names and characteristics of the seven heavens.

 <span class="c_b">Completing the Festivals portion of Rodkinson's Talmud translation.</span>
 Tract Betzah details regulations about cooking, fishing, hunting and
 other activities on feast days.
 Tract Succah discusses the Festival of the Tabernacles, particularly the
 construction and use of the Succah, or booth.
 Moed Katan is about miscellaneous laws about some minor festivals, for instance
 activites which are permissible during intercalendary periods.
 Taanith has discussions about the beginning of the rains,
 including a sequence of folktales about rainmaking Rabbis.
 Megilla is about Purim, particularly about the public reading of the book
 of Esther during that festival.
 Ebel Rabbath is about mourning and other funerary activities.

 <span class="c_b">This book starts out with three tracts on ethics</span>, including
 the lucid and moving Pirqe Aboth (Sayings of the Fathers),
 (also <a href="sjf/index.htm">available at sacred-texts in a translation by Taylor</a>).
 This edition of Aboth comes with extensive commentary.
 The Baba Kama is the first section of a three-part opening arc
 of the Jurisprudence section.
 To the modern reader it is of interest because of the unintentional
 and (sometimes pungent) atmospheric details of everyday life in
 first century Israel.
 Many of the Baba Kama cases start when 'an ox gores' someone
 or something; the modern equivalent would probably be
 automobile moving violations.
 The debates are notable because they are based equally on scripture and
 appeals to an emerging standard of common-sense justice and human rights.

 <span class="c_b">The conclusion of Baba Kama, the First Gate, and Baba Metzia, the Middle Gate.</span>
 The second half of Baba Kama continues with cases involving stolen items.
 Baba Metzia continues with civil law, particularly cases involving damages:
 among the topics are found and loaned articles, real estate, loans,
 titles, what constitutes usury and fraud, and labor law.
 Many of the cases in Baba Metzia are extremely convoluted,
 more so than usual.
 There are a few scattered legends about the life and death of the principal
 authors of the Talmud, and some notable
 passages, mostly in <a href="t06/me105.htm">Chapter IV</a>.

 <span class="c_b">This, the third part of the 'Gate' sequence of tracts, deals with
 issues of civil law regarding property</span>, including real estate, moveable
 possessions, and inheritance, in the usual great detail.
 At times the discussion becomes so hypothetical that Rodkinson,
 thankfully, skips ahead a bit.
 Sandwiched in this <i>very</i> dry volume
 is <a href="t07/t0709.htm#page_203">one wild section of Haggada</a>
 (at the end of Chapter V) which consists of some very tall tales about
 fish, alligators and nautical going-ons.
 Also, notably, this tract includes what has to be one of the first attempts
 to discuss where transgender people fit into the legal framework.

 <span class="c_b">The subject matter of Tract Sanhedrin is principally crime and punishment.</span>
 One of the most notable discussions in this book is the
 debate about the 'stubborn and rebellious son' (Chapter VIII).
 The rabbis openly express scepticism that a son who disrespects
 his father in a particular way should be put to death.
 Out of this quibble over an obscure 'worst case scenario'
 we see the emergence of a key principle of jurisprudence:
 the execution of divine law must be tempered by human mercy.
 This book also wanders far and wide,
 dispensing wisdom on such topics as the location of the lost tribes,
 what the windows on Noah's ark were made of, and when the Messiah
 is due to arrive.

 <span class="c_b">This is the final book of the Rodkinson translation of the Talmud; it contains the remaining portions of the Jurisprudence section.</span>
 Tract Maccoth deals with corporal punishment.
 Tract Shebuoth discusses oaths: what constitutes an oath, false oaths,
 and so on.
 Tract Eduyoth is a grab-bag of Mishna without commentary which
 give various cases related to other Talmud tracts.
 Tract Abuda Zara elaborates the Biblical commandment not to worship
 idols; it is of historical interest because of the tangential information
 about what the idolators (i.e. ancient Pagans) did or did not do.
 Tract Horioth is another short tract which discusses a number of
 very technical issues, including the hierarchy of dogs, cats and mice.
