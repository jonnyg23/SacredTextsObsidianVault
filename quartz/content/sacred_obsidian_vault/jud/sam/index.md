 <h1 align="CENTER">The Samaritans</h1>
 <hr>
 <p>
 This ancient sect has close historical ties to the Jewish faith.
 However, they have an entirely separate set of traditions and
 customs which diverged from Judaism long ago, before it was
 codified and homogenized.
 For instance, they believe that only the Pentateuch is divinely inspired.
 Their language is still written using an archaic version of the Hebrew
 alphabet.
 The Samaritans, who were persecuted and shunned outsiders, 
 are ironically best known because of a short parable in the New Testament
 in which a Samaritan does a good deed for a victim of a mugging
 (<a href="../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#10:25">Luke 10:25</a>).
 Today, about 300 Samaritans live in the West Bank in the vicinity of Nablus
 on Mount Gerizim, preserving their customs and language.
