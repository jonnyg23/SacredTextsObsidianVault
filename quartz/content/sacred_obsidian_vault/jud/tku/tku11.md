And this is the tradition: The Absolute desired within Himself to create the essence of light (<i>the law--that is, the letters of the alphabet, from whose transpositions the law was formed</i>), hidden for two thousand years, and produced Her. And She answered thus unto Him: "He who wisheth to dispose and to constitute other things, let Him first be disposed according unto a proper conformation."</p>

 <p>41. Into forty thousand superior worlds the brightness of the skull of His head is extended, and from the light of this brightness the just shall receive four hundred worlds in the world to come.</p>
 <p>42. This is that which is written, Gen. xxiii. 16. "Four hundred skekels of silver, current money with the merchant."</p>
 <p>43. Within His skull exist daily thirteen thousand myriads of worlds, which draw their existence from Him, and by Him are upheld.</p>
