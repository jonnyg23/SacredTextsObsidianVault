And this is that which we have said: Among the signatures of the letters (<i>is</i>) ThV, <i>Tau</i>, Th; nevertheless He impresseth it as the sign of the Ancient of Days, from Whom dependeth the perfection of knowledge, because He is perfect on every side, and hidden, and tranquil, and silent, like as good wine upon its lees.</p>
