 <p>GENERAL and special studies on Christian mysticism are numerous enough; but it is somewhat remarkable that, in their introductory pages, authors, who have much to say of Plotinus and Neoplatonism, have nothing or very little on the still more cognate subject of Jewish mysticism.

In addition to this, Dr. Abelson comes well prepared for his task, as he has already opened up a new field of research by his valuable critical study on <i>The Immanence of God in Rabbinical Literature</i>, a subject which is the indispensable presupposition of all Jewish mysticism.</p>
