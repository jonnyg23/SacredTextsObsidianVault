 <p>§ 1. Man may move even four or five kupoth <a name="fr_157"></a><a href="#fn_157"><font size="1">1</font></a> of straw or grain [to make room] for guests, or to enable disciples to obtain instruction in the law; but [he must] not [move] an entire store. [The following articles] may [likewise] be removed: clean heave-offering, <a name="fr_158"></a><a href="#fn_158"><font size="1">2</font></a> doubtful fruit, <a name="fr_159"></a><a href="#fn_159"><font size="1">3</font></a> first tithes, of which the heave-offering has been taken, second tithes, and consecrated things which have been redeemed, and dried broad-beans [as these last] are food for the [‏עניים‎] poor. [According to another version (‏עזיים‎) goats.] But it is not lawful to move ‏טבל‎, <a name="fr_160"></a><a href="#fn_160"><font size="1">4</font></a> nor first-tithes of which the heave-offering has not been taken; nor second-tithes, nor consecrated things which have not been redeemed; nor yet arum, <a name="fr_161"></a><a href="#fn_161"><font size="1">5</font></a> nor mustard. R. Simeon ben Gamaliel permits arum to be moved, as it is food for [tame] ravens.</p>  
 <p>§ 2. Bundles of straw, bundles of stalks, and bundles of reeds, if intended as fodder for cattle, may be moved; if not, they must not be moved. A basket may be set on end for chickens to climb up and down on; a runaway hen may be chased back [home] again; calves and young asses may be walked [to and fro to take exercise] in the public reshuth; a woman may also walk her child. R. Jehudah saith, "When [may she do this]? If it [the child] lift up one [leg] as it sets the other down; but if it trails [its leg behind] it is prohibited [for the mother] to walk [lead] her child, [on the Sabbath]."</p>  
 <p>§ 3. A man must not deliver [of its young] an animal that calves on the festival; but he may [otherwise] support [assist] it. [If] a woman is to be delivered on the Sabbath, the midwife must be called in to her from one place to another. The Sabbath may be violated for her sake; the navel-string is to be tied; R. José saith, "it may also be cut." Whatever is necessary for [appertains to] circumcision, may be done on the Sabbath.</p>
