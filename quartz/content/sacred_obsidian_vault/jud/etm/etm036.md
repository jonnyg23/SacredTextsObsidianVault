 <p>§ 1. The eight kinds of vermin mentioned in the law <a name="fr_145"></a><a href="#fn_145"><font size="1">1</font></a>—whoever catches or wounds one of them, is guilty. As to all other kinds of reptiles, or worms, whoever wounds [bruises] them is absolved; whoever catches them, if for use, is guilty; if not for use, is absolved. Whoever catches animals, or birds, that are [already] in his possession, is absolved; whoever wounds [bruises] them is guilty.</p>  
 <p>§ 2. Man must not make [prepare] brine on the Sabbath; but he may make [mix] salt and water wherein to dip his bread, and to put into his food, to season it. R. José observed, "And is not this [mixture] brine, whether it be more or less salted? The [only mixture of] salt and water which is permitted [on the Sabbath], is that in which oil has been previously put, either to the salt or to the water."</p>  
 <p>§ 3. It is unlawful to eat Greek hyssop on the Sabbath, because it is not food [fit] for healthy [people]; but man may eat wild-rosemary, and drink ‏אבוב רועה‎; <a name="fr_146"></a><a href="#fn_146"><font size="1">2</font></a> man may eat of any [kind of] food as medicine, and drink any kind of beverage, except water of ‏דקלים‎, <a name="fr_147"></a><a href="#fn_147"><font size="1">3</font></a> and ‏כוס עקרים‎, <a name="fr_148"></a><a href="#fn_148"><font size="1">4</font></a> as these are [only remedies] for the jaundice; but a man may drink the <i>water of Dekalim</i> for thirst, and may anoint himself with the oil of <i>Ikkarim</i>, but not as a remedy.</p>  
 <p>§ 4. He who has the toothache must not rinse his teeth with vinegar, but he may wash them as usual [dip something in vinegar and rub them], and if he does get cured, he does get cured. He who has pains in his loins, must not rub them with wine or vinegar; he may [however] anoint them with [any kind of] oil, except rose</p>

 <p>oil. Princes may anoint [dress] their wounds with rose oil, as they are in the habit of so anointing [themselves] on week-days. R. Simeon saith, "All Israelites are [to be considered as] princes [in this respect]."</p>
