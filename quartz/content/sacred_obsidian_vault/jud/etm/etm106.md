 <p>§ 1. How is it to be understood that the widow of his brother, who had not lived contemporary with him [releases her rival]? When of two [married] brothers one dies [without issue] and another brother was born after the decease of the first mentioned, and the second [or surviving] brother marries by <i>Yeboom</i> his widowed sister-in-law, and dies, then that sister-in-law is released, having been the wife of a brother who had not been contemporary with the [third, or youngest] brother. The wife [widow] of the second brother is also free, as the rival of the first mentioned, but if the other brother had only promised marriage to her and died, <a name="fr_668"></a><a href="#fn_665"><font size="1">1</font></a> then the sister-in-law must perform the ceremony of <i>Chalitzah</i>, but her brother-in-law may not marry her by <i>Yeboom</i>.</p>  
 <p>§ 2. When of two brothers one dies, and the survivor marries his widow by <i>Yeboom</i>, and another [third] brother was afterwards born, and the second brother dies, then the widow of the first brother is free, as having been the wife of a brother who had not been contemporary [with the third, or youngest brother], and the widow of the second is also free, as the rival of the first mentioned. If he had only promised her marriage and died, the second sister-in-law must perform the ceremony of <i>Chalitzah</i>, but the brother-in-law may not marry her; but R. Simeon says, "[The third brother] may marry by <i>Yeboom</i> [in the two last cases], whichever he likes, or cause either to perform to him the ceremony of <i>Chalitzah</i>."</p>  
 <p>§ 3. A rule obtains in respect to marriage by <i>Yeboom</i>. Every woman whom it is unlawful to marry, by reason of being within the degrees of relationship forbidden to intermarry, may not perform the ceremony of <i>Chalitzah</i>, nor can be married by her brother-in-law by <i>Yeboom</i>, and all women who cannot be so married, owing to other legal prohibitions, <a name="fr_669"></a><a href="#fn_666"><font size="1">2</font></a> or on account of holiness of station, must perform the ceremony of <i>Chalitzah</i>, but may not be married to the brother-in-law by <i>Yeboom</i>. When of two sisters [who had been married to two brothers] one only can be legally married [to a third, or surviving brother], she is bound either to give <i>Chalitzah</i>, or to marry that brother-in-law by <i>Yeboom</i>.</p>  
 <p>§ 4. By legal prohibitions [to marry as above mentioned] are meant the secondary degrees of relationship prohibited by the Rabbins to</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_204"><font size="1" color="green">p. 204</font></a></p>  
 <p>intermarry.—Prohibited to intermarry on account of holiness of station are, a widow to a high priest; a woman who had been divorced, or performed the ceremony of <i>Chalitzah</i>, who had [unlawfully] been married to an ordinary priest; a person born in adultery, and a daughter of the <i>Nethinin</i> <a name="fr_670"></a><a href="#fn_667"><font size="1">3</font></a> married to an Israelite, or a daughter of Israel to a <i>Nethin</i>, or to one born in adultery.</p>  
 <p>§ 5. In every case where there is a surviving brother, though of illegitimate origin, the widow of the deceased brother of such a one becomes subject to the law of <i>Yeboom</i>; he also possesses all the rights of a brother, except when he is the son of a bondwoman, or of a strange [i.e. non-Israelite] woman. In every case where there is a son, <a name="fr_671"></a><a href="#fn_668"><font size="1">4</font></a> that son releases his father's wife from the obligation of <i>Yeboom</i>, and even if illegitimate, is amenable to the penalties of the law against striking or cursing his father; he possesses, moreover, all the rights of a son, except he were the son of a bond-woman, or of a strange [i.e. non-Israelite] woman.</p>  
 <p>§ 6. When a person has given ‏קדושין‎ [i.e. betrothing] to one of two sisters, and does no longer know to which of them he gave it, he must give ‏גט‎, i.e. a letter of divorce to each. If he left at his decease one brother only, that brother must cause both [sisters] to perform <i>Chalitzah</i> to him. If he left two brothers, one must have <i>Chalitzah</i> performed to him, and the other may marry the sister-in-law by <i>Yeboom</i>, but if these brothers had already married the sisters, in anticipation, <a name="fr_672"></a><a href="#fn_669"><font size="1">5</font></a> they are not to be separated from them.</p>  
 <p>§ 7. When two men [who are strangers to each other] have each of them betrothed one of two sisters, and neither of these men know which sister he has betrothed, then each man must give two <i>Gets</i> [letters of divorce] to the sisters. If [the men] died, and each left a brother, these brothers must have <i>Chalitzah</i> given to them by both sisters. If one of the men <a name="fr_673"></a><a href="#fn_670"><font size="1">6</font></a> had one brother, and the other two, in the case of one brother only, he must have the <i>Chalitzah</i> performed by both sisters; and in that of the two brothers, one must have <i>Chalitzah</i> performed to him, and the other brother may marry his brother's widow by <i>Yeboom</i>, but if they had already married the sisters in anticipation, <a name="fr_674"></a><a href="#fn_669"><font size="1">5</font></a> they are not to be separated from them. If</p>

 <p>each man left two brothers, one brother of each pair must have <i>Chalitzah</i> performed to him by one of the sisters, and the other brother of each pair can then marry by <i>Yeboom</i> one of the sisters released by the <i>Chalitzah</i> performed to the other brother. If two brothers had already in anticipation <a name="fr_675"></a><a href="#fn_671"><font size="1">7</font></a> received <i>Chalitzah</i> from the sisters, the latter are not to be separated from them.</p>  
 <p>§ 8. It is proper that the eldest brother should perform the duty of <i>Yeboom</i>; yet, if it were done by a younger brother, the marriage is valid. When suspected of carnal intercourse with a bond-woman, or with a non-Israelite woman, he may not marry her, even after [the first mentioned] had been manumitted, or [the last mentioned] had become a proselyte, but if he did marry [any of these women], they shall not be separated; but if a person should be suspected of having had adulterous intercourse with a married woman, who, in consequence, had been separated from her husband judicially, then, even if the said suspected person had already married her, they must be separated.</p>  
 <p>§ 9. A person who brings to a married woman a <i>Get</i> from her husband, from beyond sea, <a name="fr_676"></a><a href="#fn_672"><font size="1">8</font></a> and declares that the said document was duly written and signed in his presence, <a name="fr_677"></a><a href="#fn_673"><font size="1">9</font></a> may not marry that woman. If a person should say to a married woman, "Thy husband is dead," or, "I have murdered him," or, "We have murdered him," such person may not marry that woman; R. Jehudah saith, "If he says, 'I have murdered him,' the woman may not marry at all, <a name="fr_678"></a><a href="#fn_674"><font size="1">10</font></a> but if he said, 'We have murdered him,' she may be married." <a name="fr_679"></a><a href="#fn_675"><font size="1">11</font></a></p>  
 <p>§ 10. A ‏חכם‎ [i.e. one learned in the Holy Law] who had declared binding a vow made by a woman against her husband, <a name="fr_680"></a><a href="#fn_676"><font size="1">12</font></a> may</p>

 <p>not marry her; but he may do so in case that woman appeared before him at the tribunal, and there expressed her refusal, or performed the ceremony of <i>Chalitzah;</i> and in all the above-mentioned cases, if the men were married at the time [of the prohibition], and their wives died since, they may marry the women prohibited to them before; also, in case these women had, meanwhile, been married to others, and were divorced, or had become widows, the females also prohibited to these men, may marry their sons or brothers.</p>

There is, however, a contradiction in this latter part of the Mishna; for whether such a person committed the crime alone, or in conjunction with others, he is, doubtless, equally guilty; and, therefore, why should his evidence be received in the latter case [and the woman allowed to marry], and not in the former? It is, therefore, explained to mean, that he said, "I was with those who murdered him, but did not murder him myself."</p>
