 <p>§ 1. [In the case of] him who married two wives, and dies, the first wife has a priority <a name="fr_920"></a><a href="#fn_915"><font size="1">1</font></a> before the second, and the heirs of the first [wife] <a name="fr_921"></a><a href="#fn_916"><font size="1">2</font></a> before the heirs of the second wife. Had he first married one wife, who died, and then married the second, at his own decease the second wife and her heirs have a priority before the heirs of the first wife.</p>  
 <p>§ 2. [In the case of] him that married two wives, both of whom died before his own decease, and when the orphan children claim the Ketubah of their mothers, [while] there is no more [property] than the [exact amount of the] two Ketuboth, <a name="fr_922"></a><a href="#fn_917"><font size="1">3</font></a> they divide [it between the two sets of orphans, share and share] alike. But if there is [any] surplus [property beyond the exact amount of the two Ketuboth, even though that surplus be but a single] dinar, the orphans</p>

 <p><a name="page_269"><font size="1" color="green">p. 269</font></a></p>  
 <p>of each mother receive the amount of her Ketubah. <a name="fr_923"></a><a href="#fn_918"><font size="1">4</font></a> Should the orphans <a name="fr_924"></a><a href="#fn_919"><font size="1">5</font></a> propose: "We will appraise the property of our father one dinar higher [than the real value]," they are not to be listened to, but the Bethdin must cause the property to be appraised.</p>  
 <p>§ 3. Should there be any property in expectancy, it is not [to be considered] as in [actual] possession. <a name="fr_925"></a><a href="#fn_920"><font size="1">6</font></a> R. Simeon saith, "Even though there be moveable property [beyond the amount of the two Ketuboth], it is not [to be included in the computation], but there must be immoveable property, exceeding [in value the amount of] the two Ketuboth [by at least] a dinar.</p>  
 <p>§ 4. He who married three wives and dies, the Ketubah of one [wife] being one hundred dinar, of one [wife] two hundred, and of one, three hundred [dinar], while there is only [property left to the value of] one hundred [dinar], they divide [it between them, share and share] alike. <a name="fr_926"></a><a href="#fn_921"><font size="1">7</font></a> If there be [property to the value of] two hundred dinar, she [whose Ketubah amounts] to a maneh, receives fifty dinar, while she of two hundred and she of three hundred dinar receive three gold-pieces [each gold-piece at twenty-five dinar]. Should there be [property to the value of] three hundred dinar, she [whose Ketubah is] of one hundred dinar receives fifty, she of two hundred receives one hundred, and she of three hundred dinar receives one hundred and fifty [dinar]. In like manner, three who join their funds [form a co-partnership], whether they have diminished or increased their capital, the above is [the proportion to be observed] in which they divide.</p>  
 <p>§ 5. [Of] him who married four wives and dies, the first wife has priority <a name="fr_927"></a><a href="#fn_922"><font size="1">8</font></a> before the second, the second before the third, and the third before the fourth. The first is put upon her oath by the second, the second by the third, the third by the fourth, but the fourth recovers her Ketubah without being sworn. <a name="fr_928"></a><a href="#fn_923"><font size="1">9</font></a> Ben Nanas saith,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_270"><font size="1" color="green">p. 270</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> "What! because she is the last is she to be favored? She likewise cannot recover without being sworn." Should [the Ketuboth] have all been executed on the same day, whichever [of them] precedes the others even by one hour, enjoys [the priority]. <a name="fr_929"></a><a href="#fn_924"><font size="1">10</font></a> Therefore in Jerusalem they inserted the hour. <a name="fr_930"></a><a href="#fn_925"><font size="1">11</font></a> Should all [the Ketuboth] have been executed in the same hour, and there is no more [property left] than [to the value of] a maneh, they divide [it between them, share and share] alike. <a name="fr_931"></a><a href="#fn_926"><font size="1">12</font></a></p>  
 <p>§ 6. [Of] him who has married two wives, and sells his land, <a name="fr_932"></a><a href="#fn_927"><font size="1">13</font></a> should the first wife undertake in writing to the purchaser, "Right and claim have I none against thee," <a name="fr_933"></a><a href="#fn_928"><font size="1">14</font></a> the second [wife] may [nevertheless] recover the land from the purchaser. <a name="fr_934"></a><a href="#fn_929"><font size="1">15</font></a> But then the first [wife] recovers it from the second, <a name="fr_935"></a><a href="#fn_930"><font size="1">16</font></a> and the purchaser again recovers it from the first [wife], <a name="fr_936"></a><a href="#fn_931"><font size="1">17</font></a> and thus the title [and possession of the field] keeps shifting [from one to the other] until they come to an arrangement. Such is also the case with a creditor, <a name="fr_937"></a><a href="#fn_932"><font size="1">18</font></a> and if the wife proceeds as a creditor. <a name="fr_938"></a><a href="#fn_933"><font size="1">19</font></a></p>
