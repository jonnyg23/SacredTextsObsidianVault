 <p>§ 1. On a double hearth [range], <a name="fr_86"></a><a href="#fn_86"><font size="1">1</font></a> cooked victuals may be put [shortly before the Sabbath], if it be heated with stubble or brushwood; [but if it be heated] with olive-kernels or wood, they must not put [victuals thereon], until [the lower compartment be] cleaned out, or covered with ashes. Beth Shammai hold [that] warm water [only], but not cooked victuals [may be placed on a hearth or range so heated]; but Beth Hillel hold, that [both] warm water and cooked victuals [may be placed thereon]. Beth Shammai hold that they [may] take [any thing] off [the hearth], but [must] not put [it] back [thereon]: but Beth Hillel hold that they may also put [it] back.</p>  
 <p>§ 2. If an oven is heated with stubble or brushwood, nothing must be put either into it or at the top of it. A single hearth which has been heated with stubble or with brushwood, is [considered] like a double one; but [if heated] with olive-kernels or wood, it is [considered] like an oven.</p>  
 <p>§ 3. An egg must not be put at the side of a hot kettle [on the Sabbath], that it become settled [done], nor must it be wrapped in</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_42"><font size="1" color="green">p. 42</font></a></p>  
 <p>hot cloths [with that intention], nor must it be put into hot sand, or road-[side] dust, that it [the egg] be roasted [by the heat of the sun.]</p>  
 <p>§ 4. It once happened that the inhabitants of Tiberias carried a pipe of cold water through an arm [streamlet] of their hot-well; but the sages explained to them that on the Sabbath. [this water] like any [other that had been] heated on the Sabbath-day, is prohibited, either for washing or drinking; and that on festivals [this water] like any [other that had been] heated on the festival, is prohibited for washing, but permitted for drinking. A ‏מוליאר‎ <a name="fr_87"></a><a href="#fn_87"><font size="1">2</font></a> that has been cleansed of coals [it is lawful to] drink out of [on the Sabbath]; an ‏אנטיכי‎ <a name="fr_88"></a><a href="#fn_88"><font size="1">3</font></a> even though it has been cleansed of coals [it is] not lawful [to drink out of].</p>  
 <p>§ 5. [Into the kettle of] hot water, which has been removed [from the fire], man must not pour [a small quantity of] cold water that it get warm, but he may pour cold water into a kettle or goblet of warm water, to make that tepid. <a name="fr_89"></a><a href="#fn_89"><font size="1">4</font></a> Into a pot or kettle which has been moved [from the fire] boiling, he must not put spice; but he may put [spice to the warm victuals] in a dish or on a plate. R. Jehudah saith, "Into all [kinds of vessels] he may put spice, except into [such food] things as contain vinegar or bran."</p>  
 <p>§ 6. It is not lawful to put a vessel underneath a lamp to catch the oil [that drops], but if it has been [so] put while yet day [before the Sabbath come in], it is permitted to let it remain; [but the oil caught therein] no use must be made of, as it is not [part] of what was prepared [for the consumption of the Sabbath]. A new lamp may be moved [from one place to another], but not an old one [that has already been used]. R. José saith, "All lamps may be moved, except such as are alight for the Sabbath." A vessel may be placed under a lamp to catch the sparks, but no water must be put therein, as that extinguishes.</p>
