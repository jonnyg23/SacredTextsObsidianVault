 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>M</b>.</font></span>VI. 1. What is the form of the Benediction over fruits? <a name="fr_275"></a><a href="#fn_274"><font size="1">4</font></a> Over the fruits of trees a man says: "Thou that createst the fruit of the tree"; with the exception of wine, for over wine he says: "Thou that createst the fruit of the vine." Over the fruits of the earth he says: "Thou that createst the fruit of the ground"; with the exception of a piece of bread, for over a piece of bread he says: "Thou that bringest forth bread from the earth." Over vegetables he says: "Thou</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>M</b>.</font></span>that createst the fruit of the ground." R. Judah used to say: "Thou that createst different kinds of herbs."</p>  
 <p>2. If a man has said over the fruits of trees the Benediction: "Thou that createst the fruit of the ground" <a name="fr_276"></a><a href="#fn_275"><font size="1">1</font></a> he has fulfilled his obligation. Over the fruits of the earth, "Thou that createst the fruit of the tree"—he has not fulfilled it. <a name="fr_277"></a><a href="#fn_276"><font size="1">2</font></a> And if he has said over them all, "By whose word all things exist," he has fulfilled it. <a name="fr_278"></a><a href="#fn_277"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>  
 <p>3. Over anything that has not grown out of the earth [<i>e.g.</i> animal food], he says, "By whose word all things exist." Over vinegar, and over locusts, <a name="fr_279"></a><a href="#fn_278"><font size="1">4</font></a> and over [fallen] unripe fruits, he says: "By whose word all things exist." <a name="fr_280"></a><a href="#fn_279"><font size="1">5</font></a> R. Judah says: Anything which belongs to a kind that has to do with a curse <a name="fr_281"></a><a href="#fn_280"><font size="1">6</font></a> must not have a Benediction said over it.</p>  
 <p>4. If a man has in front of him many kinds [of fruit], R. Judah says: If among them there is one of the seven kinds he says the Benediction over it. <a name="fr_282"></a><a href="#fn_281"><font size="1">7</font></a></p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>T</b>.</font></span></p><dir>T. IV. 1. Let not a man taste anything until he pronounces a Benediction, for it is said: "<i>The LORD'S is the earth, and the fulness thereof; the world and they that dwell in it</i>." <a name="fr_283"></a><a href="#fn_282"><font size="1">1</font></a> He that getteth enjoyment out of this world without a Benediction, behold, he has defrauded (the LORD), <a name="fr_284"></a><a href="#fn_283"><font size="1">2</font></a> to such a degree that at last all the commands are loosed for him. <a name="fr_285"></a><a href="#fn_284"><font size="1">3</font></a> Let not a man make use of his face, his hands, and his feet, save for the honour of his Owner, for it is said: "<i>The LORD hath made everything for His own purpose</i>." <a name="fr_286"></a><a href="#fn_285"><font size="1">4</font></a>  
 <p>2. In the case of date-honey, cider, and vinegar made from late grapes, we say Benedictions over them in the same way that we say Benedictions over brine (pickle). <a name="fr_287"></a><a href="#fn_286"><font size="1">5</font></a></p>  
 <p>3. In the case of unmixed wine, they say over it the Benediction: "Thou that createst the fruit of the tree," <a name="fr_288"></a><a href="#fn_287"><font size="1">6</font></a> and take of it for washing the hands. If one has put water into it they say over it the Benediction: "Thou that createst the fruit of the vine," and they do not take of it for washing the hands. These are the words of R. Eliezer. But the Majority say: unmixed or mixed are all one. <a name="fr_289"></a><a href="#fn_288"><font size="1">7</font></a> They say over it the Benediction: "Thou that createst the fruit of the vine," and do not take of it for washing the hands.</p>

And over the herbs he says: "Thou that createst different kinds of herbs." And over the vegetables he says: "Thou that createst the fruit of the ground." R. Judah says: "Blessed is He that causeth the earth to produce by His word." R. Meir says: Even if he has seen the piece of bread and says: "Blessed be He who created this piece of bread; how beautiful is it!"—this is its Benediction. <a name="fr_292"></a><a href="#fn_291"><font size="1">3</font></a>  
 <p>5. If he has seen figs, and has said: "Blessed be He who has created these figs; how beautiful they are"—this is their Benediction. R. Jose says: Everyone who changes the formula which the Majority formed in a Benediction has not fulfilled his obligation. R. Judah says, If anything is changed from its natural condition, and one then makes a change in the Benediction of it, he has fulfilled his obligation. <a name="fr_293"></a><a href="#fn_292"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>  
 <p>6. He that cheweth [grains of] wheat says the Benediction over them, "that createst different kinds of seeds." If he has baked them or boiled them, at the time when the grains remain [distinct], he says the Benediction over them: "Who bringest bread out from the earth," <a name="fr_294"></a><a href="#fn_293"><font size="1">5</font></a> and (after the meal) he says three Benedictions over them. <a name="fr_295"></a><a href="#fn_294"><font size="1">6</font></a> If the grains do not remain [distinct] he says the Benediction over them: "who createst different</p></dir>

 <p>7. He that cheweth rice <a name="fr_297"></a><a href="tbr39.htm#fn_296"><font size="1">2</font></a> says the Benediction over it: "who createst different kinds of seeds." If he has baked it, or boiled it, so long as the grains remain [distinct], he says the Benediction over them: "who createst different kinds of foods," and does not say any Benediction after it at all. This is the general principle, that in the case of everything which begins with (the Benediction) "who bringest out bread," one says three Benedictions after it.</p></dir>

 <p><a name="fn_272"></a><a href="tbr37.htm#fr_273">43:2</a> <i>the Proselytes . . . the Elders</i>. See the common text of No. 13.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_273"></a><a href="tbr37.htm#fr_274">43:3</a> <i>David . . . Jerusalem</i>. So the Palestinian and the common text of No. 14 (SA, p. 49). But David is not mentioned in the best text of the Babylonian form.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_274"></a><a href="tbr38.htm#fr_275">43:4</a> On Grace at meals, both before and after, see SA, pp. 278-286. The Grace before meals was very short (SA, p. 278), that after was elaborate and the rules following refer to variations in it.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_275"></a><a href="tbr38.htm#fr_276">44:1</a> <i>The ground</i>. Instead of "the tree" SA, p. 290.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_276"></a><a href="tbr38.htm#fr_277">44:2</a> <i>he has not fulfilled it</i>. A tree fairly comes under things that grow from the ground, and the Benediction may therefore pass. But a vegetable is not a tree, and to call it so in a Benediction spoils the Benediction.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_277"></a><a href="tbr38.htm#fr_278">44:3</a> SA, p. 290. For this gives glory to Him to whom it is due. The phrase "by whose word" may underlie John 1<sup>3</sup>.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_280"></a><a href="tbr38.htm#fr_281">44:6</a> <i>a curse</i>. Because of corruption as in the case of vinegar (from wine), fallen fruit, cheese, or by being symbols of destruction as in the case of locusts (Joel 2<sup>1-11</sup>).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_281"></a><a href="tbr38.htm#fr_282">44:7</a> <i>i.e.</i> the Benediction that corresponds to whichever of the seven kinds (see <a href="tbr40.htm#page_57">p. 57</a>) he chooses.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_283"></a><a href="tbr38.htm#fr_284">45:2</a> <i>defrauded</i> (<i>the LORD</i>). The verb <i>ma‘al</i> suggests Lev. 5<sup>15</sup>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_284"></a><a href="tbr38.htm#fr_285">45:3</a> <i>loosed for him</i>. One duty neglected leads to total disregard of the Law. Cf. Jas. 2<sup>10</sup>. For "loosed" <i>cf</i>. Matt. 5<sup>19</sup>.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_287"></a><a href="tbr38.htm#fr_288">45:6</a> <i>the fruit of the tree</i>. Unmixed wine was usually not drunk, it must therefore not have the same Benediction as wine mixed with water. Cf. <a href="tbr45.htm#page_64">p. 64</a>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_288"></a><a href="tbr38.htm#fr_289">45:7</a> <i>are all one</i>. Because both are from the vine.</p>
