 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>T</b>.</font></span></p><dir><b>T</b>. VI. 6. R. Judah said: The School of Shammai and the School of Hillel had no dispute about the Benediction after the meal, that it is pronounced at the beginning (of the prayer), or over the <i>Habdalah</i> that it is pronounced at the end. About what did they dispute? About the lamp and about the spices. For the School of Shammai say [the Benediction] over the lamp, and afterwards [over] the spices; and the School of Hillel say: Spices, and after that, Lamp.  
 <p>He who entereth into his house at the end of sabbath says the Benediction over the wine, and over the lamp, and over the spices, and says the <i>Habdalah</i>. And if he has only one cup he reserves it for after the meal, and strings them altogether [in a Benediction] after it; and one says the <i>Habdalah</i> at the end of sabbath, and at the end of a festival, and at the end of the Day of Atonement, and at the end of a sabbath for a festival, <a name="fr_419"></a><a href="#fn_418"><font size="1">1</font></a> and the end of a festival for the ordinary day of the feast.</p>  
 <p>He who is accustomed [to use such forms] says many <i>Habdaloth</i>, <a name="fr_420"></a><a href="#fn_419"><font size="1">2</font></a> and he who is not accustomed says one or two.</p>  
 <p>In the Lecture Hall, the School of Shammai say: One person says the Benediction for them all, and the School of Hillel say: Each single one says the Benediction for himself. <a name="fr_421"></a><a href="#fn_420"><font size="1">3</font></a></p></dir>
