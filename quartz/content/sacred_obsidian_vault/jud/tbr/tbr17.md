 <p>4. (3). He who recites the Shma‘ not loud enough for himself to hear has fulfilled his obligation. R. Jose <a name="fr_109"></a><a href="#fn_109"><font size="1">4</font></a> says he has not. If he has recited without expressing the letters exactly, R. Jose says he has fulfilled his obligation. R. Judah says he has not. He who recites in an irregular order <a name="fr_110"></a><a href="#fn_110"><font size="1">5</font></a> has not fulfilled his obligation. If he has recited and made a mistake he must return to the place where he made the mistake.</p>

He who recites the Shma‘ in an irregular order has not fulfilled his duty, and so also in the Hallel, <a name="fr_111"></a><a href="#fn_111"><font size="1">1</font></a> and so in the Prayer, <a name="fr_112"></a><a href="#fn_112"><font size="1">2</font></a> and so in the Roll. <a name="fr_113"></a><a href="#fn_113"><font size="1">3</font></a>  
 <p>4. He who recites the Shma‘ and makes a mistake, and leaves out one verse in it, must not begin and recite that verse by itself, <a name="fr_114"></a><a href="#fn_114"><font size="1">4</font></a> but he begins with that verse and finishes until the end, and so in the Hallel, and so in the Prayer, and so in the Roll. He who enters into the synagogue and finds that the congregation have said half the Shma‘, and finishes with them, should not begin and recite from the beginning of it as far as that place, but begins from the beginning and finishes to the end. And so in the Hallel, and so in the Prayer, and so in the Roll.</p>  
 <p>5. He who is reciting the Shma‘ and makes a mistake and does not know where he made it, returns to the beginning of it. If he has made the mistake in the middle of the section <a name="fr_115"></a><a href="#fn_115"><font size="1">5</font></a> he returns to the beginning of the section; if he has made the mistake between the first [verse] [where] "write" [is said] and the second, <a name="fr_116"></a><a href="#fn_116"><font size="1">6</font></a> he returns to the first.</p>  
 <p>6. They who are engaged in writing books of Scripture, Tephillin, <a name="fr_117"></a><a href="#fn_117"><font size="1">7</font></a> and Mezuzoth, <a name="fr_118"></a><a href="#fn_118"><font size="1">8</font></a> break off</p></dir>

Rabbi says: Just as they do not break off for the Prayer, so they do not break off for the recitation of the Shma. R. Chananiah ben Aqabia <a name="fr_119"></a><a href="#fn_119"><font size="1">1</font></a> says: Just as they break off for the recitation of the Shma, so they break off for the Prayer. R.

 <p>7. A porter—although the burden is on his shoulders—behold such a man recites [the Shma‘]. But at the time that he is unloading and loading he does not recite (it), for his mind is not settled between one and the other. He should not pray (the Prayer) until the time that he unloads. <a name="fr_121"></a><a href="#fn_121"><font size="1">3</font></a></p></dir>
