 <p>6. (3 <i>cont</i>.). R.

They said to him: Thou didst deserve to be guilty of thy own life because thou didst trangress the words of the School of Hillel.</p>  
 <p></p><dir><b>T</b>. I. 4. An incident is told of R. Ishmael <a name="fr_43"></a><a href="#fn_43"><font size="1">3</font></a> and R. Eleazar ben Azariah, that they were resting in a certain place, and R. Ishmael had turned on his side and R. Eleazar ben Azariah was upright. When the time of reciting the Shma‘ arrived, R. Ishmael was upright and R. Eleazar ben Azariah was turned on his side. R. Ishmael said to him: What is this, Eleazar? He said to him: Brother Ishmael, people asked a man, Why so fine a beard? He said to them, With a view to the barbers. <a name="fr_44"></a><a href="#fn_44"><font size="1">4</font></a> So</dir>

 <h3 align="CENTER">Footnotes</h3>
 <p><a name="fn_35"></a><a href="tbr11.htm#fr_35">5:1</a> <i>R. Judah ben Il‘ai</i>, in the third generation of mishna teachers, 130-160 A.D., and so always with "R. Judah" alone.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_36"></a><a href="tbr11.htm#fr_36">5:2</a> <i>R. Aqiba</i>. Put to death by the Romans c. 132 A.D. for helping Barcochba. He insisted on the inspiration of every letter of Scripture, and Aquila's over-literal translation was made under his influence. He formed a kind of mishna, which was used by R. Judah (see Strack, p. 19).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_37"></a><a href="tbr11.htm#fr_37">5:3</a> <i>R. Eleazar ben Azariah</i>. A wealthy priest and an elder contemporary of R. Aqiba. Said to be a descendant of Ezra.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_38"></a><a href="tbr12.htm#fr_38">5:4</a> <i>Shammai</i>. He and Hillel flourished in the last quarter of the first century B.C. The followers of Shammai and of Hillel formed the two principal divisions of the Pharisees, the Shammaites being much the stricter, and being the leading party until 70 A.D. Some of our Lord's words about the Pharisees have special reference to them.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_39"></a><a href="tbr12.htm#fr_39">5:5</a> To-day, as of old, the Shma‘ is usually recited in a sitting posture (SA, p. lvi).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_40"></a><a href="tbr12.htm#fr_40">5:6</a> Deut. 6<sup>7</sup>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_41"></a><a href="tbr12.htm#fr_41">6:1</a> Deut. 6<sup>7</sup>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_42"></a><a href="tbr12.htm#fr_42">6:2</a> <i>R. Tarphon</i>. He had attended the Temple service in his youth, but flourished in the first quarter of the second century A.D. He is sometimes identified with the Trypho of Justin's <i>Dialogue</i>, but, apart from the question of date (for Trypho does not give the impression of being at all an old man), rather absurdly, for the latter shows very little acquaintance with Jewish casuistry.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_43"></a><a href="tbr12.htm#fr_43">6:3</a> <i>R. Ishmael ben Elisha</i> was a contemporary of R. Aqiba, and a pupil of R. Nechuniah ben ha-Qanah (see <a href="tbr27.htm#page_30">p. 30</a>). He lived on the border of Edom, and his hermeneutical principles differed from those of R. Aqiba, for he taught that the words of Scripture should be interpreted by the general usage of human speech. His influence may be seen especially in the <i>Mekilta</i> (the midrash on Exodus), and in the <i>Siphre</i> (on Numbers and Deuteronomy).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_44"></a><a href="tbr12.htm#fr_44">6:4</a> <i>barbers</i>. The narrative is given also in the <i>Siphre</i> on Deut. 6<sup>7</sup> (ed. Friedmann, P. 74<sup>b</sup>), and the <i>Yalqut</i> on the same passage <a name="page_7"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 7</font></a>(§ 842). The meaning of Eleazar's words seems to be, Your praise of my beard means that it is fit for the barbers, and must he cut short. I, by lying down, showed my agreement with you, but you then stood upright to show you did not accept my approval. It is a case in which praise produces the opposite.</p>
