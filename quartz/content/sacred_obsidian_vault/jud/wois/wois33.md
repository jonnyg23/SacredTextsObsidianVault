 <p>Rabbi Pinchas, explaining the passage (Numb. xii.), "The likeness of God appeared unto him" [Moses], said, in the name of Rabbi Hosea: "This may be likened to an earthly king who shows himself in his true likeness only to a child of his own household. For in this world the divine glory is only revealed to individuals; but in the world to come God in His glory will be revealed to <i>all</i>. As it is written (Isa. xl.), 'And the glory of the Eternal shall be revealed, and all flesh together shall see, for the mouth of the Eternal hath spoken it.'"</p>
