 <p>Thou art One, the first of every number, and<br> the foundation of every structure,<br> Thou art One, and at the mystery of Thy Oneness the wise of heart are struck dumb,<br> For they know not what it is. <a name="page_84"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 84</font></a><br> Thou art One, and Thy Oneness can neither be increased nor lessened,<br> It lacketh naught, nor doth aught remain over.<br> Thou art One, but not like a unit to be grasped or counted,<br> For number and change cannot reach Thee.<br> Thou art not to be visioned, nor to be figured thus or thus.<br> Thou art One, but to put to Thee bound or<br> circumference my imagination would fail me.<br> Therefore I have said I will guard my ways lest I sin with the tongue.<br> Thou art One, Thou art high and exalted beyond abasement or falling,<br> "For how should the One fall?"</p>
