 <p>O habitants of homes of clay,<br>   Why lift ye such a swelling eye,<br>   Ye are but as the beasts that die,<br> What do ye boast of more than they?</p>  
 <p>It is for us the wiser part<br>   To know ourselves for worms whose doom<br>   Is in the clay to find a tomb,<br> Nor, falsely proud, exalt our heart.</p>  
 <p>What shall aught profit mortal man<br>   Whose latter end adjoins the grave?<br>   Here were no change, though Nature gave<br> A thousand years to be his span.</p>  
 <p>Should he as rebel walk, behold<br>   Earth opens hot to swallow up<br>   His ashes in her flaming cup<br> And vain is all his might of gold.</p>  
 <p>Unhappy man, with chastened soul,<br>   And opened eyes, true vision win,<br>   To see thy lowly origin<br> And thy inevitable goal.</p>  
 <p>To what may be compared thy lot?<br>   Thou art, O weak and wretched wight,<br>   The gourd that shot up in the night<br> And in the morning it was not.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_62"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 62</font></a></p>  
 <p>To be unborn were better worth<br>   Than thus to reap distress and pain,<br>   For how essay great things to gain<br> When struggling in this snare of earth?</p>  
 <p>A fallen creature from the womb,<br>   Thou sinnest for a slice of bread,<br>   And in a moments wildered dread,<br> Can live through every plague and gloom</p>  
 <p>While spirit with thy body links,<br>   With living light shall glow thy flesh,<br>   But should the soul desert its mesh,<br> To mire and sliminess it sinks.</p>  
 <p>Behold no jot with thee will stay<br>   Of all the glory now so great,<br>   Strangers shall seize thy loved estate,<br> And empty thou shalt go away.</p>  
 <p>Thy soul thou gavest oer to lust,<br>   Nor pondered on this bitter truth.<br>   But if thou sinnest in thy youth,<br> What wilt thou do when thou art dust?</p>  
 <p>O let the wicked turn aside,<br>   And take, O King, the path to Thee.<br>   Perchance the Rock will heed the plea,<br> And from His wrath the sinner hide.</p>  
 <p>O haughty-souled, come gather all,<br>   Remember and stand fast and raise<br>   Your heart and hands in common praise<br> And thus to God in heaven call:</p>  
 <p><a name="page_63"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 63</font></a></p>  
 <p>"Woe to our souls, and wellaway<br>   For all the sins that we have sinned,<br>   Alas, we have pursued the wind<br> And like to sheep have gone astray.</p>  
 <p>"What favour can we ask or grace?<br>   The wave of sin has overflowed<br>   Our heads, and heavy is our load<br> Of guilt, how dare we lift our face?</p>  
 <p>"Draw up Thy people from the pit,<br>   Thou Ruler of the depth and height,<br>   Stiff-necked were we in Thy despite,<br> Yet of Thy mercies bate no whit</p>  
 <p>"But shed Thy sweet compassion oer<br>   The people knocking at Thy gate,<br>   Thou art the Master of our fate,<br> And unto Thee our eyes upsoar."</p>
