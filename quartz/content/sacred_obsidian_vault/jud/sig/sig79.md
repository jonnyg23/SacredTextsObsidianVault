 <p>O Lord, who shall do deeds like unto Thine?<br> For Thou hast established under the throne of Thy glory<br> A standing-place for the souls of Thy saints, <a name="page_103"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 103</font></a><br> And there is the abode of the pure souls<br> That are bound up in the bundle of life.<br> They who were weary and faint here await new strength,<br> And those who failed of strength may here find repose;<br> For these are the children of rest,<br> And here is delight without end or limit,<br> For it is The-World-To-Come.<br> And here are stations and seeing-places for the standing souls,<br> Whence, in "mirrors of the serving-women,"<br> They can behold and be seen of the Lord.<br> In the palaces of the King do they dwell,<br> And at the Kings table stand,<br> And glory in the sweetness of the fruit of Intelligence,<br> For He giveth them of the dainties of the King.<br> This is the rest and the heritage<br> Whose goodness and beauty are endless,<br> Such is "the land which floweth with milk and honey and such the fruit thereof."</p>
