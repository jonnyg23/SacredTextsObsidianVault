 <p>To Thee, O living God, my being yearns,<br> For Thee my soul consumes, my spirit burns.</p>  
 <p>Within Thy chosen peoples hearts Thy glory<br> Inhabits, be they babes or fathers hoary,</p>  
 <p>To bind Thy chosen to Thy chariot wheels.<br> And with the radiance that Thee conceals</p>  
 <p>I fill my heart and make for my delight<br> A lampstand set beside me in the night.</p>  
 <p>The wisest weary them to comprehend<br> Thy mystery, then how should I ascend</p>  
 <p>The secret of Thy glorious shrine to tell?<br> Thy shining semblance is unsearchable.</p>  
 <p>Then let my craving to my own soul turn<br> To find the wealth divine for which I yearn.</p>  
 <p>For Wisdoms house is as of sapphires builded,<br> Her pavement as with gold of Ophir gilded.</p>  
 <p>Within the body is her hidden lair,<br> Like a young lion she is couchant there.</p>

 <p>She is my bliss and joy in lamentation,<br> She is my thinking cap of meditation.</p>  
 <p>What man dare all her beautys praises sum,<br> Or be to her perfections wholly dumb?</p>  
 <p>Answer her swiftly, God of grace above,<br> For she is sick with longing for Thy love.</p>  
 <p>"Gently, dear damsel, sip salvations water,<br> For thou, most dazzling maiden, art My daughter."</p>
