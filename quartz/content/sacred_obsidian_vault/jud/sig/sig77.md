 <p>Who shall descend as deep as Thy thoughts?<br> For from the splendour of the sphere of Intelligence Thou hast wrought the radiance of souls, <a name="page_101"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 101</font></a><br> And the high angels that are the messengers of Thy will,<br> The ministers of Thy presence,<br> Majestic of power and great in the Kingdom of heaven,<br> "In their hand the flaming sword that turneth every way,"<br> Performing their work whithersoever the spirit wafteth them,<br> All of them shapen to comeliness, shimmering as pearls,<br> Transcendent creatures,<br> Angels of the outer courts, or angels of the Presence,<br> Watching Thy movements.<br> From a holy place are they come,<br> And from the fount of light are they drawn.<br> They are divided into companies,<br> And on their banner are signs graven of the pen of the swift scribe.<br> There are superior and attendant bands,<br> And hosts running and returning,<br> But never weary and never faint,<br> Seeing but invisible.<br> And there are some wrought of flame,<br> And some are wafted air,<br> And some compounded of fire and of water,<br> And there are Seraphim in burning rows,<br> And wingèd lightnings and darting arrows of fire,<br> And each troop of them all bows itself down<br> "To Him who rideth the highest heavens."<br> And in the supreme sphere of the universe they stand in thousands and tens of thousands, <a name="page_102"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 102</font></a><br> Divided into watches,<br> That change daily and nightly at the beginning of their vigils,<br> For the ritual of psalms and songs,<br> "To Him who is girt with omnipotence."<br> All of them with dread and trembling bow and prostrate themselves to Thee,<br> Saying: To Thee we acknowledge<br> That Thou art He, the Lord our God;<br> Thou hast made us, and not we ourselves,<br> And the work of Thy hands are we all.<br> For Thou art our Lord, and we are Thy servants,<br> Thou art our Creator, and we are Thy witnesses.</p>
