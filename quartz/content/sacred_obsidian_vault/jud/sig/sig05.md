 <p>My soul shall declare to Thee Thou art her former<br>   And shall Thee as her maker, O God, testify,<br> At Thy word 'Be, O Soul' did she take on existence,<br>   And from naught didst Thou draw her as light from the eye.</p>  
 <p>Of Thee she shall own and affirm, hand uplifted,<br>   Twas Thou that didst breathe her in me, and as due<br> For that work she shall pour out her thanks and bear witness<br>   That to me she was given Thy bidding to do.</p>  
 <p>She serves Thee as handmaid while yet in the body,<br>   And the day she returns to the land whence she came,<br> In Thee will she dwell, for in Thee is her being,<br>   Doth she rise, doth she sit, Thou art with her the same.</p>  
 <p>She was Thine when unborn ere the day of her breathing,<br>   With wisdom and knowledge by Thee she was fed,<br> And to Thee for her ordinance looks, and subsistence,<br>   Indebted to Thee for her water and bread.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_4"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 4</font></a></p>  
 <p>Her gaze is to Thee, and in Thee is her hoping<br>   When like novice in child-birth she cries in affright.<br> O take her torn heart as a sacrifice offered,<br>   And her ribs lacerated for fiery rite.</p>  
 <p>To Thee let her pour out her tears as drink-offring,<br>   Let the breath of her sighing as incense-cloud be,<br> At her gate and her doorway she watches with prayer,<br>   She is burning like flame with her passion for Thee.</p>  
 <p>She must ever approach Thee as servant his master,<br>   Or as handmaiden looks to her mistresss eye,<br> She must spread out her palms in request and petition<br>   And turn herself humbly to Thee in her cry.</p>  
 <p>For call Thee she must, nor endure to be silent,<br>   Like a bird in the net her one hope is in flight,<br> In the depth of the night she must rise and keep vigil,<br>   For her work is Thy works to declare and recite.</p>  
 <p>For Thee she must pine and of Thee make entreaty,<br>   Her hand must be clean and as stainless her thought.<br> Her breach do Thou heal, be her hope and her helper,<br>   When she draws nigh redeem her, her sin count as naught.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_5"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 5</font></a></p>  
 <p>Behold her affliction, and hark to her weeping,<br>   In the sphere of the soul she with Thee is alone,<br> Repay and restore her, attend to her anguish,<br>   When her sobs and her tears her backslidings bemoan.</p>  
 <p>  Bemock, O Almighty, the foes that bemock her,<br> Avenge with due vengeance her insults and shame,<br>   In her stress be a rock of support gainst her foeman,<br> Nor yield up the child Thou to manhood didst frame.</p>  
 <p>  No enemy came, whose reproach could be borne with,<br> No cruel one hunted her down in her track,<br>   Twas the friends of her household betrayed herher passions<br> Twas her comrade who bloodily stabbed in the back.</p>  
 <p>  I ever am seeking my bodys best welfare,<br> Yet it in return would my spirit undo.<br>   Ah, truly the fruit of the tree in its root is,<br> The proverb "Like mother, like daughter" is true.</p>
