 This slim volume translates from the Rabbi Bachye,
 who wrote one of the first systematic treatments of philosophical Ethics
 in 12th century Spain.
 This was during a period of Jewish intellectual cross-fertilization
 with Islamic culture.
 Although Bachye was an orthodox Rabbi, he treats Ethics
 (the Duties of the Heart, in his words) as a universal science,
 derived from first principles such as the belief in God.
 This short book also runs very deep.

 <p>
 According to the introduction to this book, this was the first text to be
 published in the <a href="../../woe/index.htm">Wisdom of the East</a> series.
 So if you collect these you might want to be on the watch for
 copies of this specific volume.
 The particular edition we ended up using is a second printing, but there is
 no reason to suggest that it had any differences with the first edition.
