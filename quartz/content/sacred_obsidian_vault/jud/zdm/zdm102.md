   <h3 align="center">KABBALISTIC REMARKS ON MARRIAGE.</h3>  
 <p>SAID Rabbi Eleazar: "It is written, 'What shall we do for wives for them that remain?' (Jud. XXI. 7), and further it is added, 'Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin saying, go and lie in wait in the vineyards and catch you every man his wife, and see and behold if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances; then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you<span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">91b-92a</font></span> every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh.' This incident in connection with the tribe of Benjamin shows how a man may and can become the husband of one who is the sister soul of another, and how as tradition teaches us, betrothment may take place during a feast through fear lest another may pray to obtain the betrothed herself. On further reflection you will discover and understand the mystery or secret law that governs marriage, which is similar to that which operates when a man marries and dying leaves no offspring. When that happens, his widow is bound to espouse her late husband's brother. If she brings forth a son, he is animated with the soul of his defunct father who incarnates a second time within him. This son finds no wife who is his sympneumata because this animates his own mother. Therefore, esoteric students declare that it is permissible to celebrate betrothals during feast days, lest another, by his ardent</p>

 <p>prayers addressed to heaven, may obtain her who is about to become betrothed, as it is possible by such means to obtain a wife whose soul is the sister or twin of another man."</p>  
 <p>Said Rabbi Jehuda: "Truly the subject of marriage must be of the greatest anxiety to the Holy One. Blessed is the lot of Israel who enjoys the secret doctrine that teaches them His Holy way, as also the secrets and mysteries attending them. It is written, 'The law of the Lord is perfect converting the soul' (Ps. XIX. 7). Blessed is he who studies in it and rules his life thereby, for then he acquires length of days and learns the secret of life, as it is written, 'For length of days and long life and peace shall it add to <a href="errata.htm#75">thee</a>.'" (Prov. III. 2).</p>
