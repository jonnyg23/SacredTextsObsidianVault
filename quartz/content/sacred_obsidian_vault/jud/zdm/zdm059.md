 <p>THIS union and harmony between the finite and the infinite, God and man is the highest and deepest of mysteries, the mystery of all ages since the creation of the world. Happy are they in this world and the world to come who have attained unto a knowledge of it. Observe furthermore that the destroying angel known as "the end of all flesh" derives benefit and pleasure from acts of charity in this sense, that as such acts and deeds of charity and gratitude are a source of joy to the angels on high, so the material part of sacrifices symbolising the element of the impurity and imperfection of human nature becomes a source of strength and enjoyment to the inferior orders of spirits and this being the case, the Holy Spirit Israel's Watcher that neither slumbers nor sleeps, provides against their troubling her children and preventing their good deeds from becoming perfect and freed from impure thoughts.</p>  
 <p>At the rising of the moon in the early part of each month a goat is offered up as a supplementary sacrifice which the demon delighting in, cease <a href="errata.htm#41">for</a> the time being from troubling Israel who is thus able to make its offerings in peace that bring them into closer relationship with their Lord and King. As a he-goat is what demons delight in, so is Israel the delight and choice of the Holy One as stated in scripture "for the Lord hath chosen Jacob unto himself and Israel for his peculiar treasure" (Ps. <a href="errata.htm#42">CXXXV</a>. 4). Still further, "the end of all flesh" joys only in what is carnal and when he acquires power and influence over any one, it is over his animal or lower nature and not over his higher self.

 <p>higher and diviner life, there is a continual sacrifice, that in a measure atones for the sins of humanity in general, whereas the life of an iniquitous man is of no benefit or advantage whatever<span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">65a-65b</font></span> to the world or it is blemished with sin and wrong doing and therefore it is written, "Whatsoever hath a blemish ye shall not offer, for it will not be acceptable" (Lev. XXII. 20)<span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Lev. 22:25</font></span>. From what has been said we can understand and gather the true meaning of sacrifice and how the lives of good men subserve to the benefit and salvation of humanity.</p>
