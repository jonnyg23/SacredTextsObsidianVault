 <p align="center">Exodus xxxi. 16, 17.</p>  
 <p>And the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations, for an everlasting covenant. It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever, that in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and ceased from his work.</p>  
 <p align="center">Exod. xx. 8–11.</p>  
 <p>Remember the sabbath day to <a href="errata.htm#4">keep</a> it holy. Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is a sabbath unto the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man-servant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea and all that is therein, and rested on the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day and hallowed it.</p>  
 <p>Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who createst the fruit of the vine.</p>  
 <p>Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who bringest forth bread from the earth.</p>
