 <p align="center"><i>On Tabernacles, previous to Hallel, <a href="spb26.htm#page_313">p. 313</a>, being said, the Lulab is taken, and the following Meditation and Blessings are read:—</i></p>  
 <p>Lo, I am prepared and ready to fulfil the command of my Creator, who hath commanded us in his Law, And ye shall take you on the first day the fruit of the tree Hadar, branches of palm trees, a bough of the tree Aboth, and willows of the brook. While I wave them, may the stream of blessings flow in upon me, together with holy thoughts which tell that he is the God of gods and Lord of lords, governing below and above, whose kingdom ruleth over all. May this my observance of the precept of the Four Species be accounted as though I had fulfilled it in all its details and particulars. And let the pleasantness of the Lord our God be upon us, and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it. Blessed be the Lord for ever, Amen, and Amen.</p>  
 <p>Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast sanctified us by thy commandments, and hast given us command concerning the taking of the Lulab.</p>  
 <p>Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast kept us in life, and hast preserved us, and enabled us to reach this season.</p>  
 <p><i>The latter Blessing is said on the First Day of the Festival only. Should the First Day, however, fall on Sabbath, it is said on the Second Day</i>.</p>
