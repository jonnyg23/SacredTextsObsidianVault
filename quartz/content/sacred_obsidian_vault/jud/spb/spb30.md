 <p align="center"><i>To be said in the Tabernacle on the first night of the Festival</i>.</p>  
 <p>May it be thy will, O Lord my God and God of my fathers, to let thy divine presence abide among us. Spread over us the tabernacle of thy peace in recognition of the precept of the Tabernacle which we are now fulfilling, and whereby we establish in fear and love the unity of thy holy and blessed name. O surround us with the pure and holy radiance of thy glory, that is spread over our heads as the eagle over the nest he stirreth up: and thence bid the stream of life flow in upon thy servant (thy handmaid). And seeing that I have gone forth from my house abroad, and am speeding the way of thy commandments, may it be accounted unto me as though I had wandered far in thy cause. O wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. Keep me in life, O Lord; vouchsafe unto me the abundance of thy blessings; and to such as are hungry and thirsty give bread and water unfailingly. Make me worthy to dwell trustingly in the covert of thy shadowing wings at the time when I part from the world. O deal graciously with us in the decree to which thou settest thy seal, and make us worthy to dwell many days upon the land, the holy land, ever serving and fearing thee. Blessed be the Lord for ever. Amen and Amen.</p>  
 <p>Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast sanctified us by thy commandments, and hast commanded us to dwell in the Tabernacle.</p>  
 <p>Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast kept us in life, and hast preserved us, and enabled us to reach this season.</p>
