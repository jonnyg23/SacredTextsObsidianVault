 <p align="center">Exodus xx. 1–17.</p>  
 <p>And God spake all these words, saying.</p>  
 <p>1. I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.</p>  
 <p>2. Thou shalt have no other gods before me. Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image; nor the form of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_106"><font size="1" color="green">p. 106</font></a></p>  
 <p>upon the third and upon the fourth generation, unto them that hate me: and shewing lovingkindness to the thousandth generation, unto them that love me and keep my commandments.</p>  
 <p>3. Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.</p>  
 <p>4. Remember the sabbath day to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is a sabbath unto the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea and all that is therein, and rested on the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day and hallowed it.</p>  
 <p>5. Honor thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</p>  
 <p>6. Thou shalt not murder.</p>  
 <p>7. Thou shalt not commit adultery.</p>  
 <p>8. Thou shalt not steal.</p>  
 <p>9. Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_107"><font size="1" color="green">p. 107</font></a></p>  
 <p>10. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor s house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his manservant nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbor's.</p>
