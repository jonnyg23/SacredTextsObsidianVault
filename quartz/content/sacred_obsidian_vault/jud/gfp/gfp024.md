 <p>THE homonymous term <i>adam</i> is in the first place the name of the first man, being, as Scripture indicates, derived from <i>adamah</i>, "earth." Next, it means "mankind," as "My spirit shall not strive with man (<i>adam</i>)" (Gen. vi. 3). Again "Who knoweth the spirit of the children of man (<i>adam</i>)" (Eccles. iii. 21); "so that a man (<i>adam</i>) has no pre-eminence above a beast" (Eccles. iii. 19). Adam. signifies also "the multitude," "the lower classes" as opposed to those distinguished from the rest, as "Both low (<i>bene adam</i>) and high (<i>bene ish</i>)" (Ps. xlix. 3).</p>  
 <p>It is in this third signification that it occurs in the verses, "The sons of the higher order (<i>Elohim</i>) saw the daughters of the lower order (<i>adam</i>)" (Gen. vi. 2); and "Forsooth! as the humble man (<i>adam</i>) you shall die" (Ps. lxxxii. 7).</p>
