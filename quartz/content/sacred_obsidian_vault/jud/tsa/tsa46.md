All perjurers and illicit paramours are subject to the same death penalty to which their victim has been condemned: if it was stoning they are to be stoned; if it was burning they are to be burned. In what cases does this hold good? When the same death can be inflicted: when the death penalty attached to the crime is stoning, the accused is stoned, and also the perjurers; when burning is the penalty, both accused and perjurers are burnt. But in the present case, the unjustly accused is burnt, while the perjurers are strangled.</dir>

 <p><a name="fn_498"></a><a href="tsa46.htm#fr_505">141:2</a> The law of the false witness is derived from Deut. 19. 16 ff. On the "priest's daughter," see <i>Mishnah</i> IX. 1. Scripture (Lev. 21. 9) is silent as to the fate of the paramour; but since it must be assumed that he is to be put to death, and none of the three Biblical methods is authorized, "strangling" must be employed. See <a href="tsa17.htm#page_95">p. 95</a>, note <a href="tsa17.htm#fn_292">3</a>.</p><p></p><hr>
