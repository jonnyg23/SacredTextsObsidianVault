 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>M</b>.</font></span>VII. 5. The blasphemer <a name="fr_305"></a><a href="#fn_302"><font size="1">2</font></a> is not guilty until he have expressly uttered the Name. According to R. Jehoshua, the son of Karha, the witnesses throughout are examined by means of pseudonyms: <a name="fr_306"></a><a href="#fn_303"><font size="1">3</font></a> for example " Jose strikes Jose." But when the trial is over the sentence is not carried out under a pseudonym: all are sent out of the room except the chief witness, and it is said to him: "Say expressly what you heard." He does so, whereupon the judges stand up and rend their clothes; <a name="fr_307"></a><a href="#fn_304"><font size="1">4</font></a> and they may not mend them again. The second witness then says, "I heard the same," and the third says, "I too heard the same."</p>

 <p><a name="fn_302"></a><a href="tsa20.htm#fr_305">98:2</a> See Lev. 24. 10 ff. According to the Talmud (cf. <i>Yoma</i> 39 b), the pronunciation of the Sacred Name was at one time known to all; but "from the time that Simon the Just died"--the customary expression for the beginning of the Hellenistic period--it was gradually forgotten.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_303"></a><a href="tsa20.htm#fr_306">98:3</a> The witnesses who had heard the blasphemy might not repeat the words, but made use of an arbitrary formula to describe the crime.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_304"></a><a href="tsa20.htm#fr_307">98:4</a> Cf. Mark 14. 63; Matt. 26. 65.</p>
