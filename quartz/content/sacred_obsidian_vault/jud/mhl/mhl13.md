 <h1 align="CENTER">POEMS OF JUDAH HALEVI</h1>
 <h3 align="CENTER">ODE TO ZION</h3>
 <p>Art thou not, Zion, fain<br>
 To send forth greetings from thy sacred rock<br>
 Unto thy captive train,<br>
 Who greet thee as the remnants of thy flock?<br>
 Take thou on every side--<br>
 East, west, and south, and north -their greetings multiplied.<br>
 Sadly he greets thee still,<br>
 The prisoner of hope, who, day and night,<br>
 Sheds ceaseless tears, like dew on Hermon's hill--<br>
 Would that they fell upon thy mountain's height!</p>
 <p>Harsh is my voice when I bewail thy woes,<br>
 But when in fancy's dream<br>
 I see thy freedom, forth its cadence flows<br>
 Sweet as the harps that hung by Babel's stream.<br>
 My heart is sore distressed<br>
 For Bethel ever blessed,<br>
 For Peniel, and each ancient, sacred place.<br>
 The holy presence there<br>
 To thee is present where<br>
 Thy Maker opes thy gates, the gates of heaven to face.</p>
 <p>The glory of the Lord will ever be<br>
 Thy sole and perfect light;<br>
 No need hast thou, then, to illumine thee,<br>
 Of sun by day, or moon and stars by night.<br>
 I would that, where God's spirit was of yore<br>
 Poured out unto thy holy ones, I might<br>
 There, too, my soul outpour!<br>
 The house of kings and throne of God wert thou, <a name="page_338"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 338</font></a><br>
 How comes of it then that now<br>
 Slaves fill the throne where sat thy kings before?</p>
 <p>Oh! who will lead me on<br>
 To seek the posts where, in far-distant years,<br>
 The angels in their glory dawned upon<br>
 Thy messengers and seers?<br>
 Oh! who will give me wings<br>
 That I may fly away,<br>
 And there, at rest from all my wanderings,<br>
 The ruins of my heart among thy ruins lay?<br>
 I'll bend my face unto thy soil, and hold<br>
 Thy stones as precious gold.<br>
 And when in Hebron I have stood beside<br>
 My fathers' tombs, then will I pass in turn<br>
 Thy plains and forest wide,<br>
 Until I stand on Gilead and discern<br>
 Mount Hor and Mount Abarim, 'neath whose crest<br>
 Thy luminaries twain, thy guides and beacons rest.</p>
 <p>Thy air is life unto my soul, thy grains<br>
 Of dust are myrrh, thy streams with honey flow;<br>
 Naked and barefoot, to thy ruined fanes<br>
 How gladly would I go;<br>
 To where the ark was treasured, and in dim<br>
 Recesses dwelt the holy cherubim.</p>
 <p>I rend the beauty of my locks, and cry<br>
 In bitter wrath against the cruel fate<br>
 That bids thy holy Nazarites to lie<br>
 In earth contaminate.<br>
 How can I make or meat or drink my care,<br>
 How can mine eyes enjoy<br>
 The light of day, when I see ravens tear<br>
 Thy eagles' flesh, and dogs thy lions' whelps destroy?<br>
 Away! thou cup of sorrow's poisoned gall!<br>
 Scarce can my soul thy bitterness sustain.<br>
 When I Ahola unto mind recall, <a name="page_339"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 339</font></a><br>
 I taste thy venom; and when once again<br>
 Upon Aholiba I muse, thy dregs I drain.</p>
 <p>Perfect in beauty, Zion! how in thee<br>
 Do love and grace unite!<br>
 The souls of thy companions tenderly<br>
 Turn unto thee; thy joy was their delight,<br>
 And, weeping, they lament thy ruin now.<br>
 In distant exile, for thy sacred height<br>
 They long, and toward thy gates in prayer they bow.<br>
 Thy flocks are scattered o'er the barren waste,<br>
 Yet do they not forget thy sheltering fold,<br>
 Unto thy garments' fringe they cling, and haste<br>
 The branches of thy palms to seize and hold.<br>
 Shinar and Pathros! come they near to thee?<br>
 Naught are they by thy Light and Right divine.<br>
 To what can be compared the majesty<br>
 Of thy anointed line?<br>
 To what the singers, seers, and Levites thine?<br>
 The rule of idols fails and is cast down,<br>
 Thy power eternal is, from age to age thy crown.</p>
 <p>The Lord desires thee for his dwelling-place<br>
 Eternally; and blest<br>
 Is he whom God has chosen for the grace<br>
 Within thy courts to rest.<br>
 Happy is he that watches, drawing near,<br>
 Until he sees thy glorious lights arise,<br>
 And over whom thy dawn breaks full and clear<br>
 Set in the Orient skies.<br>
 But happiest he, who, with exultant eyes,<br>
 The bliss of thy redeemed ones shall behold,<br>
 And see thy youth renewed as in the days of old.</p>
 <h3 align="CENTER">GOD, WHOM SHALL I COMPARE TO THEE?</h3>
 <p>God! whom shall I compare to thee,<br>
 When thou to none canst likened be? <a name="page_340"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 340</font></a><br>
 Under what image shall I dare<br>
 To picture thee, when ev'rywhere<br>
 All Nature's forms thine impress bear?</p>
 <p>Greater, O Lord! thy glories are<br>
 Than all the heavenly chariot far.<br>
 Whose mind can grasp thy world's design?<br>
 Whose word can fitly thee define?<br>
 Whose tongue set forth thy powers divine?</p>
 <p>Can heart approach, can eye behold<br>
 Thee in thy righteousness untold?<br>
 Whom didst thou to thy counsel call,<br>
 When there was none to speak withal<br>
 Since thou wast first and Lord of all?</p>
 <p>Thy world eternal witness bears<br>
 That none its Maker's glory shares.<br>
 Thy wisdom is made manifest<br>
 In all things formed by thy behest,<br>
 All with thy seal's clear mark imprest.</p>
 <p>Before the pillars of the sky<br>
 Were raised, before the mountains high<br>
 Were wrought, ere hills and dales were known,<br>
 Thou in thy majesty alone<br>
 Didst sit, O God! upon thy throne!</p>
 <p>Hearts, seeking thee, from search refrain,<br>
 And weary tongues their praise restrain.<br>
 Thyself unbound by time and place,<br>
 Thou dost pervade, support, embrace<br>
 The world and all created space.</p>
 <p>The sages' minds bewildered grow,<br>
 The lightning-speed of thought is slow.<br>
 "Awful in praises" art thou named;<br>
 Thou fillest, strong in strength proclaimed,<br>
 This universe thy hand has framed.</p>
 <p><a name="page_341"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 341</font></a></p>
 <p>Deep, deep beyond all fathoming,<br>
 Far, far beyond all measuring,<br>
 We can but seek thy deeds alone;<br>
 When bow thy saints before thy throne<br>
 Then is thy faithfulness made known.</p>
 <p>Thy righteousness we can discern,<br>
 Thy holy law proclaim and learn.<br>
 Is not thy presence near alway<br>
 To them who penitently pray,<br>
 But far from those who sinning stray?</p>
 <p>Pure souls behold thee, and no need<br>
 Have they of light: they hear and. heed<br>
 Thee with the mind's keen ear, although<br>
 The ear of flesh be dull and slow.<br>
 Their voices answer to and fro.</p>
 <p>Thy holiness forever they proclaim:<br>
 The Lord of Hosts! thrice holy is Ibis name!</p>
 <h3 align="CENTER">SERVANT OF GOD</h3>
 <p>Oh! would that I might be<br>
 A servant unto thee,<br>
 Thou God by all adored:<br>
 Then, though by friends out-cast,<br>
 Thy hand would hold me fast,<br>
 And draw me near to thee, my King and Lord!</p>
 <p>Spirit and flesh are thine,<br>
 O Heavenly Shepherd mine!<br>
 My hopes, my thoughts, my fears, thou seest all)<br>
 Thou measurest my path, my steps dost know.<br>
 When thou upholdest, who can make me fall?<br>
 When thou restrainest, who can bid me go?<br>
 Oh! would that I might be<br>
 A servant unto thee, <a name="page_342"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 342</font></a><br>
 Thou God, by all adored.<br>
 Then, though by friends out-cast,<br>
 Thy band would hold me fast,<br>
 And draw me near to thee, my King and Lord!</p>
 <p>Fain would my heart come nigh<br>
 To thee, O God! on high,<br>
 But evil thoughts have led me far astray<br>
 From the pure path of righteous government.<br>
 Guide thou me back into thy holy way,<br>
 And count me not as one impenitent.<br>
 Oh! would that I might be<br>
 A servant unto thee,<br>
 Thou God, by all adored.<br>
 Then, though by friends out-cast,<br>
 Thy hand would hold me fast,<br>
 And draw me near to thee, my King and Lord!</p>
 <p>If in my youth I still<br>
 Fail to perform thy will,<br>
 What can I hope when age shall chill my breast?<br>
 Heal me, O Lord! with thee is healing found<br>
 Cast me not off, by weight of years opprest,<br>
 Forsake me not when age my strength has bound.<br>
 Oh! would that I might be<br>
 A servant unto thee,<br>
 Thou God, by all adored.<br>
 Then, though by friends out-cast,<br>
 Thy hand would bold me fast,<br>
 And draw me near to thee, my King and Lord!</p>
 <p>Contrite and full of dread,<br>
 I mourn each moment fled<br>
 Midst idle follies roaming desolate;<br>
 I sink beneath transgressions manifold,<br>
 That from thy presence keep me separate;<br>
 Nor can sin-darkened eyes thy light behold.<br>
 Oh! would that I might be <a name="page_343"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 343</font></a><br>
 A servant unto thee,<br>
 Thou God, by all adored.<br>
 Then, though by friends out-cast,<br>
 Thy hand would hold me fast,<br>
 And draw me near to thee, my King and Lord!</p>
 <p>So lead me that I may<br>
 Thy sovereign will obey.<br>
 Make pure my heart to seek thy truth divine;<br>
 When burns my wound, be thou with healing near!<br>
 Answer me, Lord! for sore distress is mine,<br>
 And say unto thy servant, I am here!<br>
 Oh! would that I might be<br>
 A servant unto thee,<br>
 Thou God, by all adored!<br>
 Then, though by friends out-cast,<br>
 Thy hand would bold me fast,<br>
 And draw me near to thee, my King and Lord!</p>
 <h3 align="CENTER">TO THE SOUL</h3>
 <p>O thou, who springest gloriously<br>
 From thy Creator's fountain blest,<br>
 Arise, depart, for this is not thy -rest!<br>
 The way is long, thou must preparèd be,<br>
 Thy Maker bids thee seek thy goal--<br>
 Return then to thy rest, my soul,<br>
 For bountifully has God dealt with thee.</p>
 <p>Behold! I am a stranger here,<br>
 My days like fleeting shadows seem.<br>
 When wilt thou, if not now, thy life redeem?<br>
 And when thou seek'st thy Maker have no fear,<br>
 For if thou have but purified<br>
 Thy heart from stain of sin and pride,<br>
 Thy righteous deeds to him shall draw thee near.</p>
 <p>O thou in strength who treadest, learn<br>
 To know thyself, cast dreams away! <a name="page_344"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 344</font></a><br>
 The goal is distant far, and short the day.<br>
 What canst thou plead th' Almighty's grace to earn?<br>
 Would thou the glory of the Lord<br>
 Behold, O soul? With prompt accord<br>
 Then to thy Father's house return, return!</p>
 <h3 align="CENTER">O SLEEPER! WAKE, ARISE!</h3>
 <p>O sleeper! wake, arise!<br>
 Delusive follies shun,<br>
 Keep from the ways of men and raise thine eyes<br>
 To the exalted One.<br>
 Hasten as haste the starry orbs of gold<br>
 To serve the Rock of old.<br>
 O sleeper! rise and call upon thy God!</p>
 <p>Behold the firmament<br>
 His hands have wrought on high,<br>
 See how his mighty arms uphold the tent<br>
 Of his ethereal sky,<br>
 And mark the host of stars that heaven reveals--<br>
 His graven rings and seals.<br>
 Tremble before his majesty and hope<br>
 For his salvation still,<br>
 Lest, when for thee the gates of fortune ope,<br>
 False pride thy spirit fill.<br>
 O sleeper! rise and call upon thy God!</p>
 <p>Go seek at night abroad<br>
 Their footsteps, who erewhile<br>
 Were saints on earth, whose lips with hymns o'erflowed,<br>
 Whose hearts were free from guilt.<br>
 Their nights were spent in ceaseless prayer and praise,<br>
 In pious fast their days.<br>
 Their souls were paths to God, and by his throne<br>
 Their place is set anigh.<br>
 Their road through life was but a stepping-stone<br>
 Unto the Lord on high.<br>
 O sleeper! rise and call upon thy God!</p>
 <p><a name="page_345"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 345</font></a></p>
 <p>Weep for thy sins, and pause<br>
 In wrongful deeds, to implore<br>
 God's pardoning grace, nor fret thyself because<br>
 Of evil-doers more.<br>
 Cleave to the right, and of thy substance bring<br>
 To honor him, thy King.<br>
 When saviors then Mount Zion joyfully,<br>
 Ascend with eager feet,<br>
 And nations shout for gladness, thou wilt be<br>
 Prepared thy God to meet.<br>
 O sleeper! rise and call upon thy God!</p>
 <p>Whence does man's wisdom flow--<br>
 Man, who of dust is wrought,<br>
 Whose poor pre-eminence on earth does show<br>
 Over the beast as naught?<br>
 Only those gazing with the inward eye<br>
 Behold God's majesty:<br>
 They have the well-spring of their being found,<br>
 More precious far than wine.<br>
 Thou also thus, though by earth's fetters bound,<br>
 Mayst find thy Rock divine.<br>
 O sleeper! rise and call upon thy God!</p>
 <p>The Lord is Lord of all,<br>
 His hands hold life and death,<br>
 He bids the lowly rise, the lofty fall,<br>
 The world obeys his breath.<br>
 Keep judgment, then, and live and cast aside<br>
 False and rebellious pride,<br>
 That asketh when and where, and all below<br>
 And all above would know;<br>
 But be thou perfect with the Lord thy God!<br>
 O sleeper! rise and call upon thy God!</p>
 <h3 align="CENTER">THE HEART'S DESIRE</h3>
 <p>Lord! unto thee are ever manifest<br>
 My inmost heart's desires, though unexprest <a name="page_346"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 346</font></a><br>
 In spoken words. Thy mercy I implore<br>
 Even for a moment--then to die were blest.</p>
 <p>Oh! if I might but win that grace divine,<br>
 Into thy hand,, O Lord, I would resign<br>
 My spirit then, and lay me down in peace<br>
 To my repose, and sweetest sleep were mine.</p>
 <p>Afar from thee in midst of life I die,<br>
 And life in death I find, when thou art nigh.<br>
 Alas! I know not how to seek thy face,<br>
 Nor how to serve and worship thee, Most High.</p>
 <p>Oh! lead me in thy path, and turn again<br>
 My heart's captivity, and break in twain<br>
 The yoke of folly: teach me to afflict<br>
 My soul, the while I yet life's strength retain.</p>
 <p>Despise not thou my lowly penitence,<br>
 Ere comes the day, when, deadened every sense,<br>
 My limbs too feeble grown to bear my weight,<br>
 A burden to myself, I journey hence.</p>
 <p>When to the all-consuming moth a prey,<br>
 My wasted form sinks slowly to decay,<br>
 And I shall seek the place my fathers sought,<br>
 And find my rest there where at rest are they.</p>
 <p>I am on earth a sojourner, a guest,<br>
 And my inheritance is in her breast,<br>
 My youth has sought as yet its own desires,<br>
 When will my soul's true welfare be my quest?</p>
 <p>The world is too much with me, and its din<br>
 Prevents my search eternal peace to win.<br>
 How can I serve my Maker when my heart<br>
 Is passion's captive, is a slave to sin?</p>
 <p><a name="page_347"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 347</font></a></p>
 <p>But should I strive to scale ambition's height,<br>
 Who with the worm may sleep ere fall of night?<br>
 Or can I joy in happiness to-day<br>
 Who know not what may chance by morning's light?</p>
 <p>My days and nights will soon, with restless speed,<br>
 Consume life's remnant yet to me decreed;<br>
 Then half my body shall the winds disperse,<br>
 Half will return to dust, as dust indeed.</p>
 <p>What more can I allege? From youth to age<br>
 Passion pursues me still at every stage.<br>
 If thou art not my portion, what is mine?<br>
 Lacking thy favor, what my heritage?</p>
 <p>Bare of good deeds, scorched by temptation's fire,<br>
 Yet to thy mercy dares my soul aspire;<br>
 But wherefore speech prolong, since unto Thee,<br>
 Lord, is manifest my heart's desire?</p>
 <h3 align="CENTER">HYMN FOR PENTECOST</h3>
 <p>When thou didst descend upon Sinai's mountain,<br>
 It trembled and shook 'neath thy mighty hand,<br>
 And the rocks were moved by thy power and splendor;<br>
 How then can my spirit before thee stand<br>
 On the day when darkness o'erspread the heavens,<br>
 And the sun was hidden at thy command?<br>
 The angels of God, for thy, great name's worship,<br>
 Are ranged before thee, a shining band,<br>
 And the children of men are waiting ever<br>
 Thy mercies unnumbered as grains of sand;<br>
 The law they received from the mouth of thy glory,<br>
 They learn and consider and understand.<br>
 Oh! accept thou their song and rejoice in their gladness,<br>
 Who proclaim thy glory in every land.</p>
 <p><a name="page_348"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 348</font></a></p>
 <h3 align="CENTER">GOD AND MAN</h3>
 <p>O Lord! I will declare<br>
 Thy holy name, thy glories past compare:<br>
 My tongue shall not conceal, O Lord!<br>
 Thy righteousness made known to me:<br>
 I heard and I believed thy word,<br>
 I will not ask presumptuously.<br>
 For should the vase of clay<br>
 "What doest thou?" unto its maker say?<br>
 Him have I sought and known,<br>
 A rock of strength, a tower of might,<br>
 Resplendent as the glorious light,<br>
 Without or veil or covering, radiant shown:<br>
 Exalted, magnified,<br>
 Extolled and glorified.</p>
 <p>The heavens from hour to hour<br>
 Declare thy wondrous works, proclaim thy power;<br>
 Sunrise and sunset, still the same,<br>
 Prostrate in awe eternally.<br>
 The angels pass through flood and flame<br>
 As unto thee they testify;<br>
 Thy praise they celebrate,<br>
 O thou, the fruit of lips who dost create.<br>
 For thou uphold'st alone,<br>
 Unwearied and invisible,<br>
 The depths, the heights, where move and dwell<br>
 The living creatures and the heavenly throne:<br>
 Exalted, magnified,<br>
 Extolled and glorified.</p>
 <p>Who has the glory praised<br>
 Fitly of him, whose word the heavens upraised?<br>
 The Eternal One, who dwells concealed<br>
 In his exalted heights, but yet<br>
 In Zion's temple, full revealed,<br>
 Did erst his glorious presence set,<br>
 And he showed visions then <a name="page_349"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 349</font></a><br>
 To cause his image to be seen of men;<br>
 Yet past all measuring<br>
 His wisdom is, past depth and height<br>
 He flashes on his prophet's sight<br>
 In visions only as the heavenly king:<br>
 Exalted, magnified,<br>
 Extolled and glorified.</p>
 <p>His power, exceeding great,<br>
 Is without end: who can his praise narrate?<br>
 Happy the man, who testifies<br>
 Unto his greatness manifold,<br>
 Whose faith in God unshaken lies,<br>
 In God, whose arms the world uphold,<br>
 Who, fearing God, can trust<br>
 In Him, acknowledging his deeds are just,<br>
 That for himself has he<br>
 Made all his works, his creatures all,<br>
 And that his awful day will call<br>
 All men, the judgment of their deeds to see:<br>
 Exalted, magnified,<br>
 Extolled and glorified.</p>
 <p>Do thou then heed and learn,<br>
 Prepare thyself thy nature to discern.<br>
 See whence thou comest, what thou art,<br>
 And who created thee and taught<br>
 Thee knowledge, and in every part<br>
 Of thee the power of motion wrought.<br>
 Mark then God's might untold,<br>
 And rouse thyself his wonders to behold.<br>
 But to himself concealed<br>
 Dare not to stretch thy hand, for then<br>
 Thou seekest, with presumptuous ken,<br>
 The first and last, the hidden and revealed:<br>
 Exalted, magnified,<br>
 Extolled and glorified.</p>
 <p><a name="page_350"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 350</font></a></p>
 <h3 align="CENTER">PASSOVER HYMN</h3>
 <p>When as a wall the sea<br>
 In heaps uplifted lay,<br>
 A new song unto thee<br>
 Sang the redeemed that day.</p>
 <p>Thou didst in his deceit<br>
 O'erwhelm the Egyptian's feet,<br>
 While Israel's footsteps fleet<br>
 How beautiful were they!</p>
 <p>Jeshurun! all who see<br>
 Thy glory cry to thee:<br>
 Who like thy God can be?<br>
 Thus even our foes did say.</p>
 <p>Oh! let thy banner soar<br>
 The scattered remnant o'er,<br>
 And gather them once more<br>
 like corn on harvest day.</p>
 <p>Who bear through all their line<br>
 Thy covenant's holy sign,<br>
 And to thy name divine<br>
 Are sanctified alway.</p>
 <p>Let all the world behold<br>
 Their token, prized of old,<br>
 Who on their garments' fold<br>
 The thread of blue display.</p>
 <p>Be then the truth made known<br>
 For whom, and whom alone,<br>
 The twisted fringe is shown,<br>
 The covenant kept this day.</p>
 <p>Oh! let them, sanctified,<br>
 Once more with thee abide,<a name="page_351"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 351</font></a><br>
 Their sun shine far and wide,<br>
 And chase the clouds away.</p>
 <p>The well-beloved declare<br>
 Thy praise and song and prayer:<br>
 "Who can with thee compare,<br>
 O Lord of Hosts?" they say.</p>
 <p>When as a wall the sea<br>
 In heaps unlifted lay,<br>
 A new song unto thee<br>
 Sang the redeemed that day.</p>
 <h3 align="CENTER">MORNING PRAYER</h3>
 <p>O lord! my life was known to thee<br>
 Ere thou hadst caused me yet to be,<br>
 Thy Spirit ever dwells in me.</p>
 <p>Could I, cast down by thee, have gained<br>
 A standing place, or, if restrained<br>
 By thee, go forth with feet unchained?</p>
 <p>Rear me, Almighty, while I pray,<br>
 My thoughts are in thy hand alway,<br>
 Be to my helplessness a stay!</p>
 <p>Oh! may this hour thy favor yield,<br>
 And may I tread life's battle-field<br>
 Encompassed by thy mercy's shield.</p>
 <p>Wake me at dawn thy name to bless,<br>
 And in thy sanctuary's recess<br>
 To praise and laud thy holiness.</p>
