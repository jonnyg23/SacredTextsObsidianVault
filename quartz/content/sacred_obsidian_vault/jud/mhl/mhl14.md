 <h3 align="CENTER">MY KING</h3>
 <p>Ere time began, ere age to age had thrilled,<br>
 I waited in his storehouse, as he willed;<br>
 He gave me being, but, my years fulfilled,<br>
 I shall be summoned back before the King.</p>
 <p>He called the hidden to the light of day,<br>
 To right and left, each side the fountain lay,<br>
 From out the stream and down the steps, the way<br>
 That led me to the garden of the King.</p>
 <p>Thou gavest me a light my path to guide,<br>
 To prove my heart's recesses still untried;<br>
 And as I went, thy voice in warning cried:<br>
 "Child! fear thou him who is thy God and King!"</p>
 <p>True weight and measure learned my heart from thee;<br>
 If blessings follow, then what joy for me!<br>
 If naught but sin, all mine the shame must be,<br>
 For that was not determined by the King.</p>
 <p>I hasten, trembling, to confess the whole<br>
 Of my transgressions, ere I reach the goal<br>
 Where mine own words must witness 'gainst my soul,<br>
 And who dares doubt the writing of the King?</p>
 <p>Erring I wandered in the wilderness,<br>
 In passion's grave night sinking powerless:<br>
 Now deeply I repent, in sore distress,<br>
 That I kept not the Statutes of the King!</p>
 <p><a name="page_353"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 353</font></a></p>
 <p>With worldly longings was my bosom fraught,<br>
 Earth's idle toys and follies all I sought;<br>
 Ah! when he judges joys so dearly bought,<br>
 How greatly shall I fear my Lord and King!</p>
 <p>Now conscience-stricken, humbled to the dust,<br>
 Doubting himself, in thee alone his trust,<br>
 He shrinks in terror back, for God is just<br>
 How can a sinner hope to reach the King?</p>
 <p>Oh! be thy mercy in the balance laid,<br>
 To hold thy servant's sins more lightly weighed,<br>
 When, his confession penitently made,<br>
 He answers for his guilt before the King.</p>
 <p>Thine is the love, O God! and thine the grace,<br>
 That folds the sinner in its mild embrace;<br>
 Thine the forgiveness bridging o'er the space<br>
 'Twixt man's works and the task set by the King.</p>
 <p>Unheeding all my sins, I cling to thee!<br>
 I know that mercy will thy footstool be:<br>
 Before I call, oh! do thou answer me,<br>
 For nothing dare I claim of thee, my King!</p>
 <p>O thou who makest guilt to disappear,<br>
 My help, my hope, my rock, I will not fear;<br>
 Though thou the body hold in dungeon drear,<br>
 The soul has found the palace of the King.</p>

 <h3 align="CENTER">HYMN FOR TABERNACLES</h3>
 <p>Thy praise, O Lord! will I proclaim<br>
 In hymns unto thy glorious name.<br>
 O thou Redeemer, Lord and King,<br>
 Redemption to thy faithful bring!<br>
 Before thine altar they rejoice <a name="page_354"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 354</font></a><br>
 With branch of palm and myrtle stem,<br>
 To thee they raise the prayerful voice--<br>
 Have mercy, save and prosper them.</p>
 <p>Mayst thou, in mercy manifold,<br>
 Dear unto thee thy people hold,<br>
 When at thy gate they bend the knee,<br>
 And worship and acknowledge thee.<br>
 Do thou their hearts' desire fulfil,<br>
 Rejoice with them in love this day,<br>
 Forgive their sins and thoughts of ill,<br>
 And their transgressions cast away.</p>
 <p>They overflow with prayer and praise<br>
 To him, who knows the future days.<br>
 Have mercy thou, and hear the prayer<br>
 Of those who palms and myrtles bear.<br>
 Thee day and night they sanctify,<br>
 And in perpetual song adore;<br>
 Like to the heavenly hosts they cry:<br>
 "Blessed art thou for evermore."</p>

 <h3 align="CENTER">JUDGMENT AND MERCY</h3>
 <p>By the faithful of his children in their conclaves<br>
 Shall his name be sanctified,<br>
 Awe-inspiring are the praises of his angels,<br>
 And the voices in his temple spread his glory<br>
 Far and wide.</p>
 <p>Those who keep his law shall yet again be gathered<br>
 To the stronghold of his might,<br>
 Those who fear him commune, praying, with each other--<br>
 He will hear and in the book of their memorial<br>
 He will write.</p>
 <p>Let your deeds be fair and righteous--then unbroken<br>
 He the covenant will hold. <a name="page_355"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 355</font></a><br>
 He who maketh bright the heavens, he will heed you<br>
 And will count your prayers more precious than the off'rings<br>
 Brought of old.</p>
 <p>May the tribes of those who worship and proclaim him<br>
 Be uplifted as of yore,<br>
 When he pruneth, may he cut the straggling branches,<br>
 For to him belong the sov'reignty and kingdom<br>
 Evermore.</p>
 <p>May he lead us once again unto the mountain<br>
 Of his sanctuary's shrine,<br>
 There to glorify him ever in his temple,<br>
 For our God will not forget his word, the holy<br>
 And divine.</p>
 <p>At his name shall heaven and earth break forth in praises<br>
 With a joy that shall not cease,<br>
 And the woods shall shout and clap their hands in gladness,<br>
 For the Lord our God has visited his people,<br>
 Bringing peace.</p>
 <p>From each band of angels mighty in their splendor,<br>
 From each shining, circling star,<br>
 Hymns and praises evermore declare his glory,<br>
 Saying, "Praise him with the sound of joyful trumpets,<br>
 The Shophar!"</p>
 <p>All the creatures of the universe together,<br>
 Heaven above and earth below,<br>
 Shall proclaim, "The Lord in all his works is mighty,<br>
 He is king o'er all the earth, and his salvation<br>
 All shall know."</p>

 <h3 align="CENTER">GRACE AFTER MEALS</h3>
 <p>Our Rock with loving care,<br>
 According to his word, <a name="page_356"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 356</font></a><br>
 Bids all his bounty share,<br>
 Then let us bless the Lord.</p>
 <p>His flock our Shepherd feeds<br>
 With graciousness divine,<br>
 He satisfies our needs<br>
 With gifts of bread and wine.<br>
 Therefore with one accord<br>
 We will his name adore,<br>
 Proclaiming evermore<br>
 None holy as the Lord.<br>
 Our Rock, etc.</p>
 <p>The land desired so long,<br>
 Our fathers' heritage,<br>
 Inspires our grateful song<br>
 To God from age to age;<br>
 His bounteous gifts afford<br>
 Us sustenance each day,<br>
 His mercy is our stay,<br>
 For faithful is the Lord.<br>
 Our Rock, etc.</p>
 <p>Oh! be thy mercy moved,<br>
 Our Rock, to dwell with us,<br>
 With Zion, thy beloved,<br>
 Our temple glorious.<br>
 May we, redeemed, restored,<br>
 Be led there, every one,<br>
 By David's holy son,<br>
 The anointed of the Lord.<br>
 Our Rock, etc.</p>
 <p>Thy city fill once more,<br>
 Thy temple-walls upraise,<br>
 There will we thee adore<br>
 With joyful songs of praise,<br>
 Thee, merciful, adored,<a name="page_357"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 357</font></a><br>
 We bless and sanctify,<br>
 With wine-cups filled up high,<br>
 By blessings of the Lord.<br>
 Our Rock, etc.</p>

 <h3 align="CENTER">LORD OF THE UNIVERSE</h3>
 <p>Lord of the universe, who reigned<br>
 Ere earth and heaven's fashioning,<br>
 When to create the world he deigned,<br>
 Then was his name proclaimèd King.</p>
 <p>And at the end of days shall he,<br>
 The Dreaded One, still reign alone,<br>
 Who was, who is, and still will be<br>
 Unchanged upon his glorious throne.</p>
 <p>And he is one, his powers transcend,<br>
 Supreme, unfathomed, depth and height,<br>
 Without beginning, without end,<br>
 His are dominion, power, and might.</p>
 <p>My God and my Redeemer he,<br>
 My rock in sorrow's darkest day,<br>
 A help and refuge unto me,<br>
 My cup's full portion, when I pray.</p>
 <p>My soul into his hand divine<br>
 Do I commend; I will not fear,<br>
 My body with it I resign,<br>
 I dread no evil; God is near.</p>
