 <h3 align="CENTER">O SOUL, WITH STORMS BESET!</h3>
 <p>O soul, with storms beset!<br>
 Thy griefs and cares forget.<br>
 Why dread earth's transient woe,<br>
 When soon thy body in the grave unseen<br>
 Shall be laid low,<br>
 And all will be forgotten then, as though<br>
 It had not been?</p>
 <p>Wherefore, my soul, be still!<br>
 Adore God's holy will,<br>
 Fear death's supreme decree.<br>
 Thus mayest thou save thyself, and win high aid<br>
 To profit thee,<br>
 When thou, returning to thy lord, shalt see<br>
 Thy deeds repaid.</p>
 <p>Why muse, O troubled soul,<br>
 O'er life's poor earthly goal?<br>
 When thou hast fled, the clay<br>
 Lies mute, nor bear'st thou aught of wealth, or might<br>
 With thee that day,<br>
 But, like a bird, unto thy nest away,<br>
 Thou wilt take flight.</p>
 <p>Why for a land lament<br>
 In which a lifetime spent<br>
 Is as a hurried breath?<br>
 Where splendor turns to gloom, and honors show<br>
 A faded wreath,<br>
 Where health and healing soon must sink beneath<br>
 The fatal bow?</p>
 <p><a name="page_335"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 335</font></a></p>
 <p>What seemeth good and fair<br>
 Is often falsehood there.<br>
 Gold melts like shifting sands,<br>
 Thy hoarded riches pass to other men<br>
 And strangers' hands,<br>
 And what will all thy treasured wealth and lands<br>
 Avail thee then?</p>
 <p>Life is a vine, whose crown<br>
 The reaper Death cuts down.<br>
 His ever-watchful eyes<br>
 Mark every step until night's shadows fall,<br>
 And swiftly flies<br>
 The passing day, and ah! how distant lies<br>
 The goal of all.</p>
 <p>Therefore, rebellious soul,<br>
 Thy base desires control;<br>
 With scantly given bread<br>
 Content thyself, nor let thy memory stray<br>
 To splendors fled,<br>
 But call to mind affliction's weight, and dread<br>
 The judgment-day.</p>
 <p>Prostrate and humbled go,<br>
 Like to the dove laid low,<br>
 Remember evermore<br>
 The peace of heaven, the Lord's eternal rest.<br>
 When burdened sore<br>
 With sorrow's load, at every step implore<br>
 His succor blest.</p>
 <p>Before God's mercy-seat<br>
 His pardoning love entreat.<br>
 Make pure thy thoughts from sin,<br>
 And bring a contrite heart as sacrifice<br>
 His grace to win--<br>
 Then will his angels come and lead thee in<br>
 To Paradise.</p>

 <h3 align="CENTER">THE LAND OF PEACE</h3>
 <p>Whose works, O Lord, like thine can be,<br>
 Who 'neath thy throne of grace,<br>
 For those pure souls from earth set free,<br>
 Hast made a dwelling-place?</p>
 <p>There are the sinless spirits bound,<br>
 Up in the bond of life,<br>
 The weary there new strength have found,<br>
 The weak have rest from strife.</p>
 <p>Sweet peace and calm their spirits bless,<br>
 Who reach that heavenly home,<br>
 And never-ending pleasantness--<br>
 Such is the world to come.</p>
 <p>There glorious visions manifold<br>
 Those happy ones delight,<br>
 And in God's presence they behold<br>
 Themselves and him aright.</p>
 <p>In the King's palace they abide,<br>
 And at his table eat,<br>
 With kingly dainties satisfied,<br>
 Spiritual food most sweet.</p>
 <p>This is the rest forever sure,<br>
 This is the heritage,<br>
 Whose goodness and whose bliss endure<br>
 Unchanged from age to age.</p>
 <p>This is the land the spirit knows<br>
 That everlastingly<br>
 With milk and honey overflows<br>
 And such its fruit shall be.</p>
