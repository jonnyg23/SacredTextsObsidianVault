 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Ark</span> which Moses made in the desert was in length two cubits and a half, and in breadth one cubit and a half, and in height one cubit and a half, as is said, "And they shall make an ark of shittim wood, two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof." <a name="fr_742"></a><a href="#fn_734"><font size="1">4</font></a> R. Meier said, "with a cubit containing six handbreadthsthus they make fifteen handbreadths. Take from them twelve handbreadths for the breadth of the tables, and two handbreadths for the place where the roll of the Law lay, and half a handbreadth from either side for the thickness of the ark. And the breadth of the ark was nine handbreadths. Take from them six handbreadths for the length of the tables,</p>

 <p>and for the place where the roll of the Law lay, two handbreadths, that it should not be pressed going in and out, and half a handbreadth on either side for the thickness of the ark." R. Judah said, "with a cubit containing five handbreadths,<font size="-1" color="green">"</font> thus there were twelve handbreadths and a half, and, four tables lay in ittwo perfect, and two broken. And the length of each table was six handbreadths, and their breadth six, and their thickness three. Take from them twelve handbreadths for the breadth of the tables, and a fingerbreadth on either side for the thickness of the ark. And the breadth of the ark was seven handbreadths and a half. Take from them six handbreadths for the length of the tables, and one handbreadth for the place where the handles (pillars) lay; and on it the explanation of the prophets is, "King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon. He made the pillars thereof of silver." <a name="fr_743"></a><a href="#fn_735"><font size="1">1</font></a> And (there was) a fingerbreadth on either side for the thickness of the ark, but the roll of the Law was put on the side, as is said, "And put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD." <a name="fr_744"></a><a href="#fn_736"><font size="1">2</font></a> And so with the Philistines, he said, "And put the jewels of gold, which ye return for a trespass-offering, in a coffer by the side thereof." <a name="fr_745"></a><a href="#fn_737"><font size="1">3</font></a> R. Judah the son of Lakish, said, "there were two arks, one which abode in the encampment, and one which went forth with them to war, and in it were the broken tables," as is said, "And the ark of the covenant of the Lord went." <a name="fr_746"></a><a href="#fn_738"><font size="1">4</font></a> But the one with them in the encampment contained the roll of the Law. That is what is written, "Nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the Lord; and Moses departed not out of the camp." <a name="fr_747"></a><a href="#fn_739"><font size="1">5</font></a> And so he said with regard to Saul, "And Saul said unto Ahiah, bring hither the ark of God." <a name="fr_748"></a><a href="#fn_740"><font size="1">6</font></a> And so of Uriah it is said, "The ark, and Israel, and Judah abide in tents." <a name="fr_749"></a><a href="#fn_741"><font size="1">7</font></a> But the ark of the covenant went not forth to war, save once only, as is said, "So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the Lord of hosts." <a name="fr_750"></a><a href="#fn_742"><font size="1">8</font></a></p>
