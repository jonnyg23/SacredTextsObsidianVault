 <p><a name="an_iii.ii-p1"></a>We<a name="an_iii.ii-p1.1"></a> glanced, at the beginning of this inquiry, at the universes which  result from the various forms of credulity practised by the  materialist, the idealist, and the sceptic. We saw the mystic denying  by word and act the validity of the foundations on which those  universes are built: substituting his living experience for their  conceptual schemes. But there is another way of seeing reality or,  more correctly, one aspect of reality. This scheme of things possesses  the merit of accepting and harmonizing many different forms of  experience; even those supreme experiences and intuitions peculiar to  the mystics. The first distinct contribution of the twentieth century  to man’s quest of the Real, it entered the philosophic arena  from several different directions; penetrating and modifying current  conceptions not only of philosophy but of religion, science, art and  practical life. It was applied by Driesch   <a name="fr_21"></a><a href="#fn_21"><font size="1">22</font></a>
     and other biologists in the sphere of organic life. Bergson,   <a name="fr_22"></a><a href="#fn_22"><font size="1">23</font></a>
     starting from psychology, developed its intellectual and metaphysical  implications; whilst Rudolph Eucken   <a name="fr_23"></a><a href="#fn_23"><font size="1">24</font></a>
     constructed from, or beside it, a philosophy of the Spirit, of  man’s relations to the Real. <a name="page_27"><font size="1" color="green">p. 27</font></a> <a name="an_iii.ii-Page_27"></a></p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.ii-p5"></a>In all these we find the same principle; the principle  of a free spontaneous and creative life as the essence of Reality. Not  law but aliveness, incalculable and indomitable, is their  subject-matter: not human logic, but actual living experience is their  criterion of truth. Vitalists, whether the sphere of their  explorations be biology, psychology or ethics, see the whole Cosmos,  the physical and spiritual worlds, as instinct with initiative and  spontaneity: as above all things free. For them, nature, though  conditioned by the matter with which she works, is stronger than her  chains. Pushing out from within, ever seeking expression, she buds and  breaks forth into original creation.   <a name="fr_24"></a><a href="#fn_24"><font size="1">25</font></a>
     The iron “laws” of the determinists are merely her  observed habits, not her fetters: and man, seeing nature in the terms  of “cause and effect,” has been the dupe of his own  limitations and prejudices.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.ii-p7"></a>Bergson, Nietzsche, Eucken, differing in their opinion  as to life’s meaning, are alike in this vision: in the stress  which they lay on the supreme importance and value of life—a  great Cosmic life transcending and including our own. This is  materialism inside out: for here what we call the universe is  presented as an expression of life, not life as an expression or  by-product of the universe. The strange passionate philosophy of  Nietzsche is really built upon an intense belief in this supernal  nature and value of Life, Action and Strength: and spoilt by the  one-sided individualism which prevented him from holding a just  balance between the great and significant life of the Ego and the  greater and more significant life of the All.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.ii-p8"></a>Obviously, the merit of vitalistic philosophy lies in  its ability to satisfy so many different thinkers, starting from such  diverse points in our common experience. On the phenomenal side it can  accept and transfigure the statements of physical science. In its  metaphysical aspect it leaves place for those ontological speculations  which seem to take their rise in psychology. It is friendly to those  who demand an important place for moral and spiritual activity in the  universe. Finally—though here we must be content with deduction  rather than declaration—it leaves in the hands of the mystics  that power of attaining to Absolute Reality which they have always  claimed: shows them as the true possessors of freedom, the  torch-bearers of the race.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.ii-p9"></a>Did it acknowledge its ancestors with that reverence  which is their due, Vitalism would identify itself with the mystic  philosopher, <a name="page_28"><font size="1" color="green">p. 28</font></a> <a name="an_iii.ii-Page_28"></a> Heracleitus; who, in the  fifth century B.C., introduced its central idea to the European world   <a name="fr_25"></a><a href="#fn_25"><font size="1">26</font></a>
    : for his “Logos” or Energizing Fire is but another symbol  for that free and living Spirit of Becoming, that indwelling creative  power, which Vitalism acknowledges as the very soul or immanent  reality of things. It is in essence both a Hellenic and a Christian  system of thought. In its view of the proper function of the intellect  it has some unexpected affinities with Aristotle, and after him with  St. Thomas Aquinas; regarding it as a departmental affair, not the  organ of ultimate knowledge. Its theory of knowledge is close to that  of the mystics: or would be, if those gazers on reality had interested  themselves in any psychological theory of their own experiences.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.ii-p11"></a>A philosophy which can harmonize such diverse elements  as these, and make its influence felt in so many fields of thought,  may be useful in our present attempt towards an understanding of  mysticism: for it illustrates certain aspects of perceived reality  which other systems ignore. It has the further recommendation of  involving not a mere diagram of metaphysical possibilities, but a  genuine theory of knowledge. Its scope includes psychology as well as  philosophy: the consideration, not only of the nature of Reality but  also of the self’s power of knowing it—the machinery of  contact between the mind and the flux of things. Thus it has an  inclusive quality lacking in the tidy ring-fenced systems of other  schools of thought. It has no edges, and if it be true to itself  should have no negations. It is a vision, not a map.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.ii-p12"></a>The primary difference between Vitalism and the  classic philosophic schools is this. Its focal point is not Being but  Becoming.   <a name="fr_26"></a><a href="#fn_26"><font size="1">27</font></a>
     Translated into Platonic language, not the changeless One, the  Absolute, transcending all succession, but rather His energizing  Thought—the Son, the Creative Logos—is the supreme reality  which it proposes as accessible to human consciousness.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.ii-p14"></a>“All things,” said Heracleitus, “are  in a state of flux.” “Everything happens through  strife.” “Reality is a condition of unrest.”   <a name="fr_27"></a><a href="#fn_27"><font size="1">28</font></a>
     Such is also the opinion of Bergson and Alexander; who, agreeing in  this with the conclusions of physical science, look upon the Real as  dynamic rather than static, as   <i>becoming</i>    rather than   <i>being</i>    <a name="page_29"><font size="1" color="green">p. 29</font></a> <a name="an_iii.ii-Page_29"></a> perfect, and invite us to see in  Time—the precession or flux of things—the very stuff of  reality—</p>   <blockquote><a name="an_iii.ii-p15.1"></a> “From the fixed lull of Heaven she saw<br>   Time like a pulse shake fierce<br>   Through all the worlds”—   <a name="fr_28"></a><a href="#fn_28"><font size="1">29</font></a>
   <br>  </blockquote>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.ii-p17"></a>said Rossetti of the Blessed Damozel. So Bergson,  while ignoring if he does not deny the existence of the “fixed  lull,” the still Eternity, the point of rest, finds everywhere  the pulse of Time, the vast unending storm of life and love. Reality,  says Bergson, is pure creative Life; a definition which excludes those  ideas of perfection and finality involved in the idealist’s  concept of Pure Being as the Absolute and Unchanging One.   <a name="fr_29"></a><a href="#fn_29"><font size="1">30</font></a>
     This life, as he sees it, is fed from within rather than upheld from  without. It evolves by means of its own inherent and spontaneous  creative power. The biologist’s Nature “so careful of the  type”; the theologian’s Creator transcending His universe,  and “holding all things in the hollow of His hand”: these  are gone, and in their place we have a universe teeming with free  individuals, each self-creative, each evolving eternally, yet towards  no term.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.ii-p19"></a>Here, then, the deep instinct of the human mind that  there must be a unity, an orderly plan in the universe, that the  strung-along beads of experience do really form a rosary, though it be  one which we cannot repeat, is deliberately thwarted. Creation,  Activity, Movement; this, says Vitalism, rather than any merely  apparent law and order, any wholeness, is the essential quality of the  Realms the Real: and life is an eternal Becoming, a ceaseless  changefulness. At its highest it may be conceived as “the  universe flowering into deity,”   <a name="fr_30"></a><a href="#fn_30"><font size="1">31</font></a>
     As the Hermetic philosophers found in the principle of analogy,  <a name="an_iii.ii-p20.1"></a>  <i>“Quod inferius sicut quod superius,”</i>       <a name="fr_31"></a><a href="#fn_31"><font size="1">32</font></a>
    the Key of Creation, so we are invited to see in that uninterrupted  change which is the condition of our normal consciousness, a true  image, a microcosm of the living universe as a part of which that  consciousness has been evolved.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.ii-p22"></a>If we accept this theory, we must then impute to life  in its fullness—the huge, many levelled, many coloured life, the  innumerable worlds which escape the rhythm of our senses; not merely  that patch of physical life which those senses perceive—a  divinity, a greatness of destiny far beyond that with which it is  credited by those who hold to a physico-chemical theory of the <a name="page_30"><font size="1" color="green">p. 30</font></a> <a name="an_iii.ii-Page_30"></a> universe. We must perceive in it, as some  mystics have done, “the beating of the Heart of God”; and  agree with Heracleitus that “there is but one wisdom, to  understand the knowledge by which all things are steered through the  All.”   <a name="fr_32"></a><a href="#fn_32"><font size="1">33</font></a>
     Union with reality—apprehension of it—will upon this  hypothesis be union with life at its most intense point: in its most  dynamic aspect. It will be a deliberate harmony set up with the Logos  which that same philosopher described as “man’s most  constant companion.”   <i>Ergo,</i>    says the mystic, union with a Personal and Conscious spiritual  existence, immanent in the world—one form, one half of the union  which I have always sought, since this is clearly life in its highest  manifestation. Beauty, Goodness, Splendour, Love, all those shining  words which exhilarate the soul, are but the names of aspects or  qualities picked out by human intuition as characteristic of this  intense and eternal Life in which is the life of men.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.ii-p24"></a>How, then, may we knew this Life, this creative and  original soul of things, in which we are bathed; in which, as in a  river, swept along? Not, says Bergson bluntly, by any intellectual  means. The mind which thinks it knows Reality because it has made a  diagram of Reality, is merely the dupe of its own categories. The  intellect is a specialized aspect of the self, a form of  consciousness: but specialized for very different purposes than those  of metaphysical speculation. Life has evolved it in the interests of  life; has made it capable of dealing with “solids,” with  concrete things. With these it is at home. Outside of them it becomes  dazed, uncertain of itself; for it is no longer doing its natural  work, which is to   <i>help</i>    life, not to   <i>know</i>    it. In the interests of experience, and in order to grasp  perceptions, the intellect breaks up experience, which is in reality a  continuous stream, an incessant process of change and response with no  separate parts, into purely conventional “moments,”  “periods,” or psychic “states.” It picks out  from the flow of reality those bits which are significant for human  life; which “interest” it, catch its attention. From these  it makes up a mechanical world in which it dwells, and which seems  quite real until it is subjected to criticism. It does, says Bergson,  the work of a cinematograph: takes snapshots of something which is  always moving, and by means of these successive static  representations—none of which are real, because Life, the object  photographed, never was at rest—it recreates a picture of life,  of motion. This rather jerky representation of divine harmony, from  which innumerable moments are left out, is useful for practical  purposes: but it is not reality, because it is not alive.   <a name="fr_33"></a><a href="#fn_33"><font size="1">34</font></a>
     <a name="page_31"><font size="1" color="green">p. 31</font></a> <a name="an_iii.ii-Page_31"></a></p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.ii-p26"></a>This “real world,” then, is the result of  your selective activity, and the nature of your selection is largely  outside your control. Your cinematograph machine goes at a certain  pace, takes its snapshots at certain intervals. Anything which goes  too quickly for these intervals, it either fails to catch, or merges  with preceding and succeeding movements to form a picture with which  it can deal. Thus we treat, for instance, the storm of vibrations  which we convert into “sound” and “light.”  Slacken or accelerate its clock-time, change its rhythmic activity,  and at once you take a different series of snapshots, and have as a  result a different picture of the world. Thanks to the time at which  the normal human machine is set, it registers for us what we call, in  our simple way, “the natural world.” A slight accession of  humility or common sense might teach us that a better title would be  “  <i>our</i>    natural world.”</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.ii-p27"></a>Let human consciousness change or transcend its  rhythm, and any other aspect of any other world may be ours as a  result. Hence the mystics’ claim that in their ecstasies they  change the conditions of consciousness, and apprehend a deeper reality  which is unrelated to human speech, cannot be dismissed as  unreasonable. Do not then confuse that surface-consciousness which man  has trained to be an organ of utility and nothing more—and which  therefore can only deal adequately with the “given” world  of sense—with that mysterious something in you, that ground of  personality, inarticulate but inextinguishable, by which you are aware  that a greater truth exists. This truth, whose neighbourhood you feel,  and for which you long, is Life. You are in it all the while,  “like a fish in the sea, like a bird in the air,” as St.  Mechthild of Hackborn said many centuries ago.   <a name="fr_34"></a><a href="#fn_34"><font size="1">35</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.ii-p29"></a>Give yourself, then, to this divine and infinite life,  this mysterious Cosmic activity in which you are immersed, of which  you are born. Trust it. Let it surge in on you. Cast off, as the  mystics are always begging you to do, the fetters of the senses, the  “remora of desire”; and making your interests identical  with those of the All, rise to freedom, to that spontaneous, creative  life which, inherent in every individual self, is our share of the  life of the Universe. You are yourself   <i>vital</i>   —a free centre of energy—did you but know it. You can move  to higher levels, to greater reality, truer self-fulfilment, if you  will. Though you be, as Plato said, like an oyster in your shell, you  can open that shell to the living waters without, draw from the  “Immortal Vitality.” Thus only—by contact with the  real—shall you   <i>know</i>    reality. <a name="an_iii.ii-p29.1"></a>  <i>Cot ad cot loquitur.</i>   </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.ii-p30"></a>The Indian mystics declare substantially the same  truth when they say that the illusion of finitude is only to be  escaped by <a name="page_32"><font size="1" color="green">p. 32</font></a> <a name="an_iii.ii-Page_32"></a> relapsing into the  substantial and universal life, abolishing individuality. So too, by a  deliberate self-abandonment to that which Plato calls the  “saving madness” of ecstasy, did the initiates of Dionysus  “draw near to God.” So their Christian cousins assert that  “self-surrender” is the only way: that they must die to  live, must lose to find: that knowing implies being: that the method  and secret which they have always practiced consists merely in a meek  and loving union—the synthesis of passion and  self-sacrifice—with that divine and unseparated life, that  larger consciousness in which the soul is grounded, and which they  hold to be an aspect of the life of God. In their hours of  contemplation, they deliberately empty themselves of the false images  of the intellect, neglect the cinematograph of sense. Then only are  they capable of transcending the merely intellectual levels of  consciousness, and perceiving that Reality which “hath no  image.”</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.ii-p31"></a>“Pilgrimage to the place of the wise,”  said Jalalu ‘ddin, “is to find escape from the flame of  separation.” It is the mystics’ secret in a nutshell.  “When I stand empty   <i>in</i>    God’s will and empty   <i>of</i>    God’s will and of all His works and of God Himself,”  cries Eckhart with his usual violence of language,   <i>“then</i>    am I above all creatures and am neither God nor creature, but I am  what I was and evermore shall be.”   <a name="fr_35"></a><a href="#fn_35"><font size="1">36</font></a>
     He attains, that is to say, by this escape from a narrow selfhood,  not to identity with God—that were only conceivable upon a basis  of pantheism—but to an identity with his own substantial life,  and through it with the life of a real and living universe; in  symbolic language, with “the thought of the Divine Mind”  whereby union with that Mind in the essence or ground of the soul  becomes possible. The first great message of Vitalistic philosophy is  then seen to be—Cease to identify your intellect and your self:  a primary lesson which none who purpose the study of mysticism may  neglect. Become at least aware of, if you cannot “know,”  the larger, truer self: that root and depth of spirit, as St.  François de Sales calls it, from which intellect and feeling grow  as fingers from the palm of the hand—that free creative self  which constitutes your true life, as distinguished from the scrap of  consciousness which is its servant.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.ii-p33"></a>How then, asks the small consciously-seeking  personality of the normal man, am I to become aware of this, my larger  self, and of the free, eternal, spiritual life which it lives?</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.ii-p34"></a>Here philosophy, emerging from the water-tight  compartment in which metaphysics have lived too long retired, calls in  psychology; and tells us that in intuition, in a bold reliance on  contact between the totality of the self and the external  world—perhaps too in those strange states of lucidity which  accompany <a name="page_33"><font size="1" color="green">p. 33</font></a> <a name="an_iii.ii-Page_33"></a> great emotion and defy  analysis—lies the normal man’s best chance of attaining,  as it were, a swift and sidelong knowledge of this real. Smothered in  daily life by the fretful activities of our surface-mind, reality  emerges in our great moments; and, seeing ourselves in its radiance,  we know, for good or evil, what we are. “We are not pure  intellects . . . around our conceptional and logical thought there  remains a vague, nebulous Somewhat, the substance at whose expense the  luminous nucleus we call the intellect is formed.”   <a name="fr_36"></a><a href="#fn_36"><font size="1">37</font></a>
     In this aura, this diffused sensitiveness, we are asked to find  man’s medium of communication with the Universal Life.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.ii-p36"></a>Such fragmentary, dim and unverifiable perceptions of  the Real, however, such “excursions into the Absolute,”  cannot be looked upon as a satisfaction of man’s hunger for  Truth. He does not want to peep, but to live. Hence he cannot be  satisfied with anything less than a total and permanent adjustment of  his being to the greater life of reality. This alone can resolve the  disharmonies between the self and the world, and give meaning and  value to human life.   <a name="fr_37"></a><a href="#fn_37"><font size="1">38</font></a>
     The possibility of this adjustment—of union between man’s  life and that “independent spiritual life” which is the  stuff of reality—is the theme alike of mysticism and of  Eucken’s spiritual vitalism or Activistic Philosophy.   <a name="fr_38"></a><a href="#fn_38"><font size="1">39</font></a>
     Reality, says Eucken, is an independent spiritual world,  unconditioned by the apparent world of sense. To know it and to live  in it is man’s true destiny. His point of contact with it is  personality: the inward fount of his being: his heart, not his head.  Man is real, and in the deepest sense alive, in virtue of this free  personal life-principle within him; but he is bound and blinded by the  ties set up between his surface-intelligence and the sense-world. The  struggle for reality must be a struggle on man’s part to  transcend the sense-world, escape its bondage. He must renounce it,  and be “re-born” to a higher level of consciousness;  shifting his centre of interest from the natural to the spiritual  plane. According to the thoroughness with which he does this, will be  the amount of real life he enjoys. The initial break with the  “world,” the refusal to spend one’s life communing  with one’s own cinematograph picture, is essential <a name="page_34"><font size="1" color="green">p. 34</font></a> <a name="an_iii.ii-Page_34"></a> if the freedom of the infinite is to be  attained. We are amphibious creatures: our life moves upon two levels  at once—the natural and the spiritual. The key to the puzzle of  man lies in the fact that he is “the meeting point of various  stages of Reality.”   <a name="fr_39"></a><a href="#fn_39"><font size="1">40</font></a>
     All his difficulties and triumphs are grounded in this. The whole  question for him is, which world shall be central for him—the  real, vital, all-embracing life we call spirit, or the lower life of  sense? Shall “Existence,” the superficial obvious thing,  or “Substance,” the underlying verity, be his home? Shall  he remain the slave of the senses with their habits and customs, or  rise to a plane of consciousness, of heroic endeavour, in  which—participating in the life of spirit—he knows reality  because he is real?</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.ii-p40"></a>The mystics, one and all, have answered this question  in the same sense, and proved in their own experience that the  premises of “Activism” are true. This application of the  vitalistic idea to the transcendental world, does in fact fit the  observed facts of mysticism far more closely even than it fits the  observed facts of man’s ordinary mental life.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.ii-p41"></a>(1) The primary break with the sense-world. (2) The  “new” birth and development of the spiritual consciousness  on high levels—in Eucken’s eyes an essential factor in the  attainment of reality. (3) That ever closer and deeper dependence on  and appropriation of the fullness of the Divine Life; a conscious  participation, and active union with the infinite and eternal. These  three imperatives, as we shall see later, form an exact description of  the psychological process through which the mystics pass. If then this  transcendence is the highest destiny of the race, mysticism becomes  the crown of man’s ascent towards Reality; the orderly  completion of the universal plan.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.ii-p42"></a>The mystics show us this independent spiritual life,  this fruition of the Absolute, enjoyed with a fullness to which others  cannot attain. They are the heroic examples of the life of spirit; as  the great artists, the great discoverers, are the heroic examples of  the life of beauty and the life of truth. Directly participating, like  all artists, in the Divine Life, they are usually persons of great  vitality: but this vitality expresses itself in unusual forms, hard of  understanding for ordinary men. When we see a picture or a poem, hear  a musical composition, we accept it as an expression of life, an  earnest of the power which brought it forth. But the deep  contemplations of the great mystic, his visionary reconstructions of  reality, and the fragments of them which he is able to report, do not  seem to us—as they are—the equivalents, or more often the  superiors of the artistic and scientific achievements of other great  men. <a name="page_35"><font size="1" color="green">p. 35</font></a> <a name="an_iii.ii-Page_35"></a></p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.ii-p43"></a>Mysticism, then, offers us the history, as old as  civilization, of a race of adventurers who have carried to its term  the process of a deliberate and active return to the divine fount of  things. They have surrendered themselves to the life-movement of the  universe, hence have lived with an intenser life than other men can  ever know; have transcended the “sense-world” in order to  live on high levels the spiritual life. Therefore they witness to all  that our latent spiritual consciousness, which shows itself in the  “hunger for the Absolute,” can be made to mean to us if we  develop it; and have in this respect a unique importance for the race.  It is the mystics, too, who have perfected that method of intuition,  that knowledge by union, the existence of which philosophy has been  driven to acknowledge. But where the metaphysician obtains at best a  sidelong glance at that Being “unchanging yet elusive,”  whom he has so often defined but never discovered, the artist a brief  and dazzling vision of the Beauty which is Truth, they gaze with  confidence into the very eyes of the Beloved.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.ii-p44"></a>The mystics, again, are, by their very constitution,  acutely conscious of the free and active “World of  Becoming,” the Divine Immanence and its travail. It is in them  and they are in it: or, as they put it in their blunt theological way,  “the Spirit of God is within you.” But they are not  satisfied with this statement and this knowledge; and here it is that  they part company with vitalism. It is, they think, but half a truth.  To know Reality in this way, to know it in its dynamic aspect, enter  into “the great life of the All”: this is indeed, in the  last resort, to know it supremely from the point of view of  man—to liberate from selfhood the human consciousness—but  it is not to know it from the point of view of God. There are planes  of being beyond this; countries dark to the intellect, deeps into  which only the very greatest contemplatives have looked. These, coming  forth, have declared with Ruysbroeck that “God according to the  Persons is Eternal Work, but according to the Essence and Its  perpetual stillness He is Eternal Rest.”   <a name="fr_40"></a><a href="#fn_40"><font size="1">41</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.ii-p46"></a>The full spiritual consciousness of the true mystic is  developed not in one, but in two apparently opposite but really  complementary directions:—</p>   <blockquote><a name="an_iii.ii-p46.1"></a> “. . . io vidi<br>   Ambo le corte del ciel manifeste.”   <a name="fr_41"></a><a href="#fn_41"><font size="1">42</font></a>
   <br>  </blockquote>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.ii-p48"></a>On the one hand he is intensely aware of, and knows  himself to be at one with that active World of Becoming, that immanent  Life, from which his own life takes its rise. Hence, though he has  broken <a name="page_36"><font size="1" color="green">p. 36</font></a> <a name="an_iii.ii-Page_36"></a> for ever with the bondage of the  senses, he perceives in every manifestation of life a sacramental  meaning; a loveliness, a wonder, a heightened significance, which is  hidden from other men. He may, with St. Francis, call the Sun and the  Moon, Water and Fire, his brothers and his sisters: or receive, with  Blake, the message of the trees. Because of his cultivation of  disinterested love, because his outlook is not conditioned by  “the exclusive action of the will-to-live,” he has  attained the power of communion with the living reality of the  universe; and in this respect can truly say that he finds “God  in all and all in God.” Thus, the skilled spiritual vision of  Lady Julian, transcending the limitations of human perception,  entering into harmony with a larger world whose rhythms cannot be  received by common men,   <i>saw</i>    the all-enfolding Divine Life, the mesh of reality. “For as the  body is clad in the cloth,” she said, “and the flesh in  the skin and the bones in the flesh and the heart in the whole, so are  we, soul and body, clad in the Goodness of God and enclosed. Yea, and  more homely: for all these may waste and wear away, but the Goodness  of God is ever whole.”   <a name="fr_42"></a><a href="#fn_42"><font size="1">43</font></a>
     Many mystical poets and pantheistic mystics never pass beyond this  degree of lucidity.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.ii-p50"></a>On the other hand, the full mystic consciousness also  attains to what is, I think, its really characteristic quality. It  develops the power of apprehending the Absolute, Pure Being, the  utterly Transcendent: or, as its possessor would say, can experience  “passive union with God.” This all-round expansion of  consciousness, with its dual power of knowing by communion the  temporal and eternal, immanent and transcendent aspects of  reality—the life of the All, vivid, flowing and changing, and  the changeless, conditionless life of the One—is the peculiar  mark, the <a name="an_iii.ii-p50.1"></a>  <i>ultimo sigillo</i>     of the great mystic, and must never be forgotten in  studying his life and work.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.ii-p51"></a>As the ordinary man is the meeting-place between two  stages of reality—the sense-world and the world of spiritual  life—so the mystic, standing head and shoulders above ordinary  men, is again the meeting-place between two orders. Or, if you like it  better, he is able to perceive and react to reality under two modes.  On the one hand he knows, and rests in, the eternal world of Pure  Being, the “Sea Pacific” of the Godhead, indubitably  present to him in his ecstasies, attained by him in the union of love.  On the other, he knows—and works in—that “stormy  sea,” the vital World of Becoming which is the expression of Its  will. “Illuminated men,” says Ruysbroeck, “are  caught up, above the reason, into naked vision. There the Divine Unity  dwells and calls them. Hence their bare vision, cleansed and free,  penetrates the activity <a name="page_37"><font size="1" color="green">p. 37</font></a> <a name="an_iii.ii-Page_37"></a> of all created  things, and pursues it to search it out even to its height.”   <a name="fr_43"></a><a href="#fn_43"><font size="1">44</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.ii-p53"></a>Though philosophy has striven since thought  began—and striven in vain—to resolve the paradox of Being  and Becoming, of Eternity and Time, she has failed strangely enough to  perceive that a certain type of personality has substituted experience  for her guesses at truth; and achieved its solution, not by the  dubious processes of thought, but by direct perception. To the great  mystic the “problem of the Absolute” presents itself in  terms of life, not in terms of dialectic. He solves it in terms of  life: by a change or growth of consciousness which—thanks to his  peculiar genius—enables him to apprehend that two-fold Vision of  Reality which eludes the perceptive powers of other men. It is  extraordinary that this fact of experience a central fact for the  understanding of the contemplative type—has received so little  attention from writers upon mysticism. As we proceed with our inquiry,  its importance, its far-reaching implications in the domains of  psychology, of theology, of action, will become more and more evident.  It provides the reason why the mystics could never accept the diagram  of the Vitalists or Evolutionists as a complete statement of the  nature of Reality. “Whatever be the limits of your knowledge, we  know”—they would say—“that the world has  another aspect than this: the aspect which is present to the Mind of  God.” “Tranquillity according to His essence, activity  according to His nature: perfect stillness, perfect fecundity,”   <a name="fr_44"></a><a href="#fn_44"><font size="1">45</font></a>
     says Ruysbroeck again, this is the two-fold character of the  Absolute. That which to us is action, to Him, they declare, is rest,  “His very peace and stillness coming from the brimming fullness  of His infinite life.”   <a name="fr_45"></a><a href="#fn_45"><font size="1">46</font></a>
     That which to us is Many, to that Transcendent Knower is One. Our  World of Becoming rests on the bosom of that Pure Being which has ever  been the final Object of man’s quest: the “river in which  we cannot bathe twice” is the stormy flood of life flowing  toward that divine sea. “How glorious,” says the Voice of  the Eternal to St. Catherine of Siena, “is that soul which has  indeed been able to pass from the stormy ocean to Me, the Sea Pacific,  and in that Sea, which is Myself, to fill the pitcher of her  heart.”   <a name="fr_46"></a><a href="#fn_46"><font size="1">47</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.ii-p57"></a>The evolution of the mystic consciousness, then,  brings its possessors to this transcendent point of view: their secret  is this unity in diversity, this stillness in strife. Here they are in  harmony with Heracleitus rather than with his modern interpreters.  That <a name="page_38"><font size="1" color="green">p. 38</font></a> <a name="an_iii.ii-Page_38"></a> most mystical of philosophers  discerned a hidden unity beneath the battle, transcending all created  opposites, and taught his disciples that “Having hearkened not  unto me but unto the Logos, it is wise to confess that all things are   <i>one.”</i>    <a name="fr_47"></a><a href="#fn_47"><font size="1">48</font></a>
    This is the secret at which the idealists’ and concept of Pure  Being has tried, so timidly, to hint: and which the Vitalists’  more intimate, more actual concept of Becoming has tried, so  unnecessarily, to destroy. We shall see the glorious raiment in which  the Christian mystics deck it when we come to consider their  theological map of the quest.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.ii-p59"></a>If it be objected—and this objection has been  made by advocates of each school of thought—that the existence  of the idealists’ and mystics’ “Absolute” is  utterly inconsistent with the deeply alive, striving life which the  Vitalists identify with reality, I reply that both concepts at bottom  are but symbols of realities which the human mind can never reach: and  that the idea of stillness, unity and peace is and has ever been  humanity’s best translation of its intuition of the achieved  Perfection of God. “‘In the midst of silence a hidden word  was spoken to me.’ Where is this Silence, and where is the place  in which this word is spoken? It is in the purest that the soul can  produce, in her noblest part, in the Ground, even the Being of the  Soul.”   <a name="fr_48"></a><a href="#fn_48"><font size="1">49</font></a>
     So Eckhart: and here he does but subscribe to a universal tradition.  The mystics have always insisted that “Be still, be still, and   <i>know</i>   ” is the condition of man’s purest and most direct  apprehensions of reality: that he experiences in quiet the truest and  deepest activity: and Christianity when she formulated her philosophy  made haste to adopt and express this paradox.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.ii-p61"></a><a name="an_iii.ii-p61.1"></a>  <i>“Quid es ergo, Deus meus?”</i>     said St. Augustine, and gave an answer in which the  vision of the mystic, the genius of the philosopher, combined to hint  something at least of the paradox of intimacy and majesty in that  all-embracing, all-transcending One. “Summe, optime,  potentissime, omnipotentissime, misericordissime et justissime,  secretissime et presentissime, pulcherrime et fortissime; stabilis et  incomprehensibilis; immutabilis, mutans omnia. Numquam novus, nunquam  vetus. . . . Semper agens, semper quietus: colligens et non egens:  portans et implens et protegens; creans et nutriens et perficiens:  quaerens cum nihil desit tibi. . . . Quid dicimus, Deus meus, vita  mea, dulcedo mea sancta? Aut quid dicit aliquis, cum de te  dicit?”   <a name="fr_49"></a><a href="#fn_49"><font size="1">50</font></a>
     <a name="page_39"><font size="1" color="green">p. 39</font></a> <a name="an_iii.ii-Page_39"></a></p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.ii-p63"></a>It has been said that “Whatever we may do, our  hunger for the Absolute will never cease.” This  hunger—that innate craving for, and intuition of, a final Unity,  an unchanging good—will go on, however heartily we may feed on  those fashionable systems which offer us a dynamic or empirical  universe. If, now, we admit in all living creatures—as Vitalists  must do—an instinct of self-preservation, a free directive force  which may be trusted and which makes for life: is it just to deny such  an instinct to the human soul? The “entelechy” of the  Vitalists, the “hidden steersman,” drives the phenomenal  world on and up. What about that other sure instinct embedded in the  race, breaking out again and again, which drives the spirit on and up;  spurs it eternally towards an end which it feels to be definite yet  cannot define? Shall we distrust this instinct for the Absolute, as  living and ineradicable as any other of our powers, merely because  philosophy finds it difficult to accommodate and to describe?</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.ii-p64"></a>“We must,” says Plato in the  “Timaeus,” “make a distinction of the two great  forms of being, and ask, ‘What is that which Is and has no  Becoming, and what is that which is always becoming and never  Is?’“   <a name="fr_50"></a><a href="#fn_50"><font size="1">51</font></a>
     Without necessarily subscribing to the Platonic answer to this  question, we may surely acknowledge that the question itself is sound  and worth asking; that it expresses a perennial demand of human  nature; and that the analogy of man’s other instincts and  cravings assures us that these his fundamental demands always indicate  the existence of a supply.   <a name="fr_51"></a><a href="#fn_51"><font size="1">52</font></a>
     The great defect of Vitalism, considered as a system, is that it only  answers half the question; the half which Absolute Idealism disdained  to answer at all.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.ii-p67"></a>We have seen that the mystical experience, the fullest  all-round experience in regard to the transcendental world which  humanity has attained, declares that there are two aspects, two planes  of discoverable Reality. We have seen also that hints of these two  planes—often clear statements concerning them—abound in  mystical literature of the personal first-hand type.   <a name="fr_52"></a><a href="#fn_52"><font size="1">53</font></a>
     Pure Being, <a name="page_40"><font size="1" color="green">p. 40</font></a> <a name="an_iii.ii-Page_40"></a> says Boutroux in the course  of his exposition of Boehme,   <a name="fr_53"></a><a href="#fn_53"><font size="1">54</font></a>
     has two characteristic manifestations. It shows itself to us as  Power, by means of strife, of the struggle and opposition of its own  qualities. But it shows itself to us as Reality, in harmonizing and  reconciling within itself these discordant opposites.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.ii-p70"></a>Its manifestation as Power, then, is for us in the  dynamic World of Becoming, amidst the thud and surge of that life  which is compounded of paradox, of good and evil, joy and sorrow, life  and death. Here, Boehme declares that the Absolute God is voluntarily  self-revealing. But each revelation has as its condition the  appearance of its opposite: light can only be recognized at the price  of knowing darkness, life needs death, love needs wrath. Hence if Pure  Being—the Good, Beautiful and True—is to reveal itself, it  must do so by evoking and opposing its contrary: as in the Hegelian  dialectic no idea is complete without its negative. Such a revelation  by strife, however, is rightly felt by man to be incomplete. Absolute  Reality, the Player whose sublime music is expressed at the cost of  this everlasting friction between bow and lyre, is present, it is  true, in His music. But He is best known in that “light  behind,” that unity where all these opposites are lifted up into  harmony, into a higher synthesis; and the melody is perceived, not as  a difficult progress of sound, but as a whole.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.ii-p71"></a>We have, then, (  <i>a</i>   ) The achieved Reality which the Greeks, and every one after them,  meant by that seemingly chill abstraction which they called Pure  Being: that Absolute One, unconditioned and undiscoverable, in Whom  all is resumed. In the undifferentiated Godhead of Eckhart, the  Transcendent Father of orthodox Christian theology, we see the  mind’s attempt to conceive that “wholly other”  Reality, unchanging yet changer of all. It is the great contribution  of the mystics to humanity’s knowledge of the real that they  find in this Absolute, in defiance of the metaphysicians, a personal  object of love, the goal of their quest, a “Living One who lives  first and lives perfectly, and Who, touching me, the inferior,  derivative life, can cause me to live by Him and for His sake”   <a name="fr_54"></a><a href="#fn_54"><font size="1">55</font></a>
    .</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.ii-p73"></a>(  <i>b</i>   ) But, contradicting the nihilism of Eastern contemplatives, they see  also a reality in the dynamic side of things: in the seething pot of  appearance. They are aware of an eternal Becoming, a striving, free,  evolving life; not merely as a shadow-show, but as an implicit of  their Cosmos felt also in the travail of their own  souls—God’s manifestation or showing, in which He is  immanent, in which His Spirit truly works and strives. It is in   <i>this</i>    plane of <a name="page_41"><font size="1" color="green">p. 41</font></a> <a name="an_iii.ii-Page_41"></a> reality that all individual  life is immersed: this is the stream which set out from the Heart of  God and “turns again home.”</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.ii-p74"></a>The mystic knows his task to be the attainment of  Being, Eternal Life, union with the One, the “return to the  Father’s heart”: for the parable of the Prodigal Son is to  him the history of the universe. This union is to be attained, first  by cooperation in that Life which bears him up, in which he is  immersed. He must become conscious of this “great life of the  All,” merge himself in it, if he would find his way back whence  he came. <a name="an_iii.ii-p74.1"></a>   <i>Vae soli</i>       .    Hence there are really two distinct acts of “divine  union,” two distinct kinds of illumination involved in the  Mystic Way: the dual character of the spiritual consciousness brings a  dual responsibility in its train. First, there is the union with Life,  with the World of Becoming: and parallel with it, the illumination by  which the mystic “gazes upon a more veritable world.”  Secondly, there is the union with Being, with the One: and that final,  ineffable illumination of pure love which is called the  “knowledge of God.” It is through the development of the  third factor, the free, creative “spirit,” the scrap of  Absolute Life which is the ground of his soul, that the mystic can (a)  conceive and (b) accomplish these transcendent acts. Only Being can  know Being: we “behold that which we are, and are that which we  behold.” But there is a spark in man’s soul, say the  mystics, which is real—which in fact is—and by its  cultivation we may know reality. “Thus,” says Von  Hügel “a real succession, real efforts, and the continuous  sense of limitation and inadequacy are the very means in and through  which man apprehends increasingly (if only he thus loves and wills)  the contrasting yet sustaining Simultaneity, Spontaneity, Infinity,  and pure action of the Eternal Life of God.”   <a name="fr_55"></a><a href="#fn_55"><font size="1">56</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.ii-p76"></a>Over and over again—as Being and Becoming, as  Eternity and Time, as Transcendence and Immanence, Reality and  Appearance, the One and the Many—these two dominant ideas,  demands, imperious instincts of man’s self will reappear; the  warp and woof of his completed universe. On the one hand is his  intuition of a remote, unchanging Somewhat calling him: on the other  there is his longing for and as clear intuition of an intimate,  adorable Somewhat, companioning him. Man’s true Real, his only  adequate God, must be great enough to embrace this sublime paradox, to  take up these apparent negations into a higher synthesis. Neither the  utter transcendence of extreme Absolutism, nor the utter immanence of  the Vitalists will do. Both these, taken alone, are declared by the  mystics to be incomplete. They conceive that Absolute Being who is the  goal of their quest as manifesting Himself in a World of Becoming:  working in it, at one with it <a name="page_42"><font size="1" color="green">p. 42</font></a> <a name="an_iii.ii-Page_42"></a> yet though  <a name="an_iii.ii-p76.1"></a>  <i>semper agens,</i>     also <a name="an_iii.ii-p76.2"></a>  <i>semper quietus</i>    .The Divine spirit which they know to be immanent in  the heart and in the universe comes forth from and returns to the  Transcendent One; and this division of persons in unity of substance  completes the “Eternal Circle, from Goodness, through Goodness,  to Goodness.”</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.ii-p77"></a>Absolute Being and Becoming, the All and the One, are  found to be alike inadequate to their definition of this discovered  Real; the “triple star of Goodness, Truth, and Beauty.”  Speaking always from experience—the most complete experience  achieved by man—they assure us of an Absolute which overpasses  and includes the Absolute of philosophy, far transcends that Cosmic  life which it fills and sustains, and is best defined in terms of  Transcendent Personality; which because of its unspeakable richness  and of the poverty of human speech, they have sometimes been driven to  define only by negations. At once static and dynamic, above life and  in it, “all love yet all law,” eternal in essence though  working in time, this vision resolves the contraries which tease those  who study it from without, and swallows up whilst it kindles to life  all the partial interpretations of metaphysics and of science.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.ii-p78"></a>Here then stands the mystic. By the help of two types  of philosophy, eked out by the resources of symbolic expression and  suggestion, he has contrived to tell us something of his vision and  his claim. Confronted by that vision—that sublime intuition of  eternity—we may surely ask, indeed are bound to ask, “What  is the machinery by which this self, akin to the imprisoned and  sense-fed self of our daily experience, has contrived to slip its  fetters and rise to those levels of spiritual perception on which  alone such vision can be possible to man? How has it brought within  the field of consciousness those deep intuitions which fringe upon  Absolute Life; how developed powers by which it is enabled to arrive  at this amazing, this superhuman concept of the nature of  Reality?” Psychology will do something, perhaps, to help us to  an answer to this question; and it is her evidence which we must  examine next. But for the fullest and most satisfying answer we must  go to the mystics; and they reply to our questions, when we ask them,  in the direct and uncompromising terms of action, not in the refined  and elusive periods of speculative thought.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.ii-p79"></a>“Come with us,” they say to the bewildered  and entangled self, craving for finality and peace, “and we will  show you a way out that shall not only be an issue from your prison,  but also a pathway to your Home. True, you are immersed, fold upon  fold, in the World of Becoming; worse, you are besieged on all sides  by the persistent illusions of sense. But you too are a child of the  Absolute. You bear within you the earnest of your inheritance. At the  apex of <a name="page_43"><font size="1" color="green">p. 43</font></a> <a name="an_iii.ii-Page_43"></a> your spirit there is a little  door, so high up that only by hard climbing can you reach it. There  the Object of your craving stands and knocks; thence came those  persistent messages—faint echoes from the Truth eternally  hammering at your gates—which disturbed the comfortable life of  sense. Come up then by this pathway, to those higher levels of reality  to which, in virtue of the eternal spark in you, you belong. Leave  your ignoble ease, your clever prattle, your absurd attempts to solve  the apparent contradictions of a Whole too great for your useful  little mind to grasp. Trust your deep instincts: use your latent  powers. Appropriate that divine, creative life which is the very  substance of your being. Remake yourself in its interest, if you would  know its beauty and its truth. You can only behold that which you   <i>are.</i>    Only the Real can know Reality.”</p>   <h4 align="center"><a name="an_iii.ii-p79.1"></a>NOTE TO THE TWELFTH EDITION</h4>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.ii-p80"></a>THE changed philosophic outlook since this chapter was  first written, eighteen years ago, has now given to it a somewhat  old-fashioned air. The ideas of Bergson and Eucken no longer occupy  the intellectual foreground. Were I now writing it for the first time,  my examples would be chosen from other philosophers, and especially  from those who are bringing back into modern thought the critical  realism of the scholastics. But the position which is here  defended—that a limited dualism, a “Two-step  philosophy,” is the only type of metaphysic adequate to the  facts of mystical experience remains in my own mind as true as before.  Now that mysticism enjoys the patronage of many pious monists and  philosophic naturalists, this view seems more than ever in need of  strong and definite statement.</p>

The only remedy here is radically to    alter the conception of man himself, to distinguish within him the    narrower and the larger life, the life that is straitened and finite    and can never transcend itself, and an infinite life through which    he enjoys communion with the immensity and the truth of the    universe. Can man rise to this spiritual level? On the possibility    of his doing so rests all our hope of supplying any meaning or value    to life” (“Der Sinn und Wert des Lebens,” p.    81).</p>

Highest, best, most potent [    <i>i.e.</i>     , dynamic], most omnipotent [    <i>i.e,</i>      transcendent], most merciful and most just, most deeply hid and yet    most near. Fairest, yet strongest: steadfast, yet unseizable;    unchangeable yet changing all things: never new, yet never old. . .    . Ever busy, yet ever at rest; gathering yet needing not: bearing,    filling, guarding: creating, nourishing and perfecting; seeking    though Thou hast no wants. . . . What can I say, my God, my life, my    holy joy? or what can any say who speaks of Thee?” Compare the    strikingly similar Sufi definition of the Nature of God, as given in    Palmer’s “Oriental Mysticism,” pp. 22,23.    “First and last, End and Limit of all things, incomparable and    unchangeable, always near yet always far,” &amp;c. This    probably owes something to Platonic influence.</p>
