 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p1"></a>First<a name="an_iv.ii-p1.1"></a> in the sequence of the mystic states, we must consider that decisive  event, the awakening of the transcendental consciousness.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p2"></a>This awakening, from the psychological point of view,  appears to be an intense form of the phenomenon of  “conversion”; and closely akin to those deep and permanent  conversions of the adult type which some religious psychologists call  “sanctification.”   <a name="fr_341"></a><a href="#fn_341"><font size="1">342</font></a>
     It is a disturbance of the equilibrium of the self, which results in  the shifting of the field of consciousness from lower to higher  levels, with a consequent removal of the centre of interest from the  subject to an object now brought into view: the necessary beginning of  any process of transcendence. It must not, however, be confused or  identified with religious conversion as ordinarily understood: the  sudden and emotional acceptance of theological beliefs which the self  had previously either rejected or treated as conventions dwelling upon  the margin of consciousness and having no meaning for her actual life.  The mechanical process may be much the same; but the material  involved, the results attained, belong to a higher order of  reality.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p4"></a>“Conversion,” says Starbuck, in words  which are really far more descriptive of mystical awakening than of  the revivalistic phenomena encouraged by American Protestantism,  “is primarily an unselfing. The first birth of the individual is  into his own little world. He is controlled by the deep-seated  instincts of self-preservation and self-enlargement—instincts  which are, doubtless, a direct <a name="page_177"><font size="1" color="green">p. 177</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ii-Page_177"></a>  inheritance from his brute ancestry. The universe is organized around  his own personality as a centre.” Conversion, then, is  “the larger world-consciousness now pressing in on the  individual consciousness. Often it breaks in suddenly and becomes a  great new revelation. This is the first aspect of conversion: the  person emerges from a smaller limited world of existence into a larger  world of being. His life becomes swallowed up in a larger  whole.”   <a name="fr_342"></a><a href="#fn_342"><font size="1">343</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p6"></a>All conversion entails the abrupt or gradual emergence  of intuitions from below the threshold, the consequent remaking of the  field of consciousness, an alteration in the self’s attitude to  the world. “It is,” says Pratt, “a change of  taste—the most momentous one that ever occurs in human  experience.”   <a name="fr_343"></a><a href="#fn_343"><font size="1">344</font></a>
     But in the mystic this process is raised to the nth degree of  intensity, for in him it means the first emergence of that passion for  the Absolute which is to constitute his distinctive character: an  emergence crucial in its effect on every department of his life. Those  to whom it happens, often enough, are already “religious”:  sometimes deeply and earnestly so. Rulman Merswin, St. Catherine of  Genoa, George Fox, Lucie-Christine—all these had been bred up in  piety, and accepted in its entirety the Christian tradition. They were  none the less conscious of an utter change in their world when this  opening of the soul’s eye took place.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p8"></a>Sometimes the emergence of the mystical consciousness  is gradual, unmarked by any definite crisis. The self slides gently,  almost imperceptibly, from the old universe to the new. The records of  mysticism, however, suggest that this is exceptional: that travail is  the normal accompaniment of birth. In another type, of which George  Fox is a typical example, there is no conversion in the ordinary  sense; but a gradual and increasing lucidity, of which the beginning  has hardly been noticed by the self, intermittently accompanies the  pain, misery of mind, and inward struggles characteristic of the  entrance upon the Way of Purgation. Conversion and purification then  go hand in hand, finally shading off into the serenity of the  Illuminated State. Fox’s “Journal” for the year 1647  contains a vivid account of these “showings” or growing  transcendental perceptions of a mind not yet at one with itself, and  struggling towards clearness of sight. “Though my exercises and  troubles,” he says, “were very great, yet were they not so  continual but I had some intermissions, and was sometimes brought into  such a heavenly joy that I thought I had been in Abraham’s  bosom. . . . Thus in the deepest miseries, and in the greatest sorrows  and temptations that many times <a name="page_178"><font size="1" color="green">p. 178</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ii-Page_178"></a> beset  me, the Lord in His mercy did keep me. I found that there were two  thirsts in me, the one after the creatures to get help and strength  there; and the other after the Lord, the Creator. . . . It was so with  me, that there seemed to be two pleadings in me. . . . One day when I  had been walking solitarily abroad and was come home, I was wrapped up  in the love of God, so that I could not but admire the greatness of  his love. While I was in that condition it was opened unto me by the  eternal Light and Power, and I saw clearly therein. . . . But O! then  did I see my troubles, trials, and temptations more clearly than ever  I had done.”   <a name="fr_344"></a><a href="#fn_344"><font size="1">345</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p10"></a>The great oscillations of the typical mystic between  joy and pain are here replaced by a number of little ones. The  “two thirsts” of the superficial and spiritual  consciousness assert themselves by turns. Each step towards the vision  of the Real brings with it a reaction. The nascent transcendental  powers are easily fatigued, and the pendulum of self takes a shorter  swing. “I was swept up to Thee by Thy Beauty, and torn away from  Thee by my own weight,” says St. Augustine, crystallizing the  secret of this experience in an unforgettable phrase.   <a name="fr_345"></a><a href="#fn_345"><font size="1">346</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p12"></a>Commonly, however, if we may judge from those  first-hand accounts which we possess, mystic conversion is a single  and abrupt experience, sharply marked off from the long, dim struggles  which precede and succeed it. It usually involves a sudden and acute  realization of a splendour and adorable reality in the world—or  sometimes of its obverse, the divine sorrow at the heart of  things—never before perceived. In so far as I am acquainted with  the resources of language, there are no words in which this  realization can be described. It is of so actual a nature that in  comparison the normal world of past perception seems but twilit at the  best. Consciousness has suddenly changed its rhythm and a new aspect  of the universe rushes in. The teasing mists are swept away, and  reveal, if only for an instant, the sharp outline of the Everlasting  Hills. “He who knows this will know what I say, and will be  convinced that the soul has then another life.”   <a name="fr_346"></a><a href="#fn_346"><font size="1">347</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p14"></a>In most cases, the onset of this new consciousness  seems to the self so sudden, so clearly imposed from without rather  than developed from within, as to have a supernatural character. The  typical case is, of course, that of St. Paul: the sudden light, the  voice, the ecstasy, the complete alteration of life. We shall see,  however, when we come to study the evidence of those mystics who have  left a detailed record of their preconverted state, that <a name="page_179"><font size="1" color="green">p. 179</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ii-Page_179"></a> the apparently abrupt conversion is really, as  a rule, the sequel and the result of a long period of restlessness,  uncertainty, and mental stress. The deeper mind stirs uneasily in its  prison, and its emergence is but the last of many efforts to escape.  The temperament of the subject, his surroundings, the vague but  persistent apprehensions of a supersensual reality which he could not  find yet could not forget; all these have prepared him for it.   <a name="fr_347"></a><a href="#fn_347"><font size="1">348</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p16"></a>When, however, the subconscious intuitions, long ago  quickened, are at last brought to birth and the eyes are opened on new  light—and it is significant that an actual sense of blinding  radiance is a constant accompaniment of this state of  consciousness—the storm and stress, the vague cravings and  oscillations of the past life are forgotten. In this abrupt  recognition of reality “all things are made new”: from  this point the life of the mystic begins. Conversion of this sort has,  says De Sanctis, three marked characteristics: a sense of liberation  and victory: a conviction of the nearness of God: a sentiment of love  towards God.   <a name="fr_348"></a><a href="#fn_348"><font size="1">349</font></a>
     We might describe it as a sudden, intense, and joyous perception of  God immanent in the universe; of the divine beauty and unutterable  power and splendour of that larger life in which the individual is  immersed, and of a new life to be lived by the self in correspondence  with this now dominant fact of existence. “Suddenly,” says  the French contemplative Lucie-Christine of the beginning of her  mystical life, “I saw before my inward eyes these words—  <i>God only . . .</i>    they were at the same time a Light, an Attraction and a Power. A  Light which showed me how I could belong completely to God alone in  this world, and I saw that hitherto I had not well understood this; an  Attraction by which my heart was subdued and delighted; a Power which  inspired me with a generous resolution and somehow placed in my hands  the means of carrying it out.”   <a name="fr_349"></a><a href="#fn_349"><font size="1">350</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p19"></a>I will here set down for comparison a few instances of  such mystical conversion; quoting, where this is available, the actual  description left by the subject of his own experience, or in default  of it, the earliest authentic account. In these cases, when grouped  together, we shall see certain constant characteristics, from which it  may be possible to deduce the psychological law to which they owe  their peculiar form. <a name="page_180"><font size="1" color="green">p. 180</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ii-Page_180"></a></p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p20"></a>First in point of time, and perhaps also in  importance, amongst those I have chosen, is the case of that great  poet and contemplative, that impassioned lover of the Absolute, St.  Francis of Assisi. The fact that St. Francis wrote little and lived  much, that his actions were of unequalled simplicity and directness,  long blinded his admirers to the fact that he is a typical mystic: the  only one, perhaps, who forced the most trivial and sordid  circumstances of sensual life to become perfect expressions of  Reality.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p21"></a>Now the opening of St. Francis’s eyes, which  took place in A.D. 1206 when he was twenty-four years old, had been  preceded by a long, hard struggle between the life of the world and  the persistent call of the spirit. His mind, in modern language, had  not unified itself. He was a high-spirited boy, full of vitality: a  natural artist, with all the fastidiousness which the artistic  temperament involves. War and pleasure both attracted him, and upon  them, says his legend, he “miserably squandered and wasted his  time.”   <a name="fr_350"></a><a href="#fn_350"><font size="1">351</font></a>
     Nevertheless, he was vaguely dissatisfied. In the midst of  festivities, he would have sudden fits of abstraction: abortive  attempts of the growing transcendental consciousness, still imprisoned  below the threshold but aware of and in touch with the Real, to force  itself to the surface and seize the reins. “Even in  ignorance,” says Thomas of Celano again, “he was being led  to perfect knowledge.” He loved beauty, for he was by nature a  poet and a musician, and shrank instinctively from contact with  ugliness and disease. But something within ran counter to this  temperamental bias, and sometimes conquered it. He would then  associate with beggars, tend the leprous, perform impulsive acts of  charity and self-humiliation.   <a name="fr_351"></a><a href="#fn_351"><font size="1">352</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p24"></a>When this divided state, described by the legend as  “the attempt to flee God’s hand,” had lasted for  some years, it happened one day that he was walking in the country  outside the gates of Assisi, and passed the little church of S.  Damiano, “the which” (I again quote from Thomas of  Celano’s “Second Life”) “was almost ruinous  and forsaken of all men. And, being led by the Spirit, he went in to  pray; and he fell down before the Crucifix in devout supplication, and    <i>having been smitten by unwonted visitations, found himself another  man than he who had gone in.”</i> </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p25"></a>Here, then, is the first stage of conversion. The  struggle between two discrepant ideals of life has attained its term.  A sudden and apparently “irrational” impulse to some  decisive act reaches the surface-consciousness from the seething  deeps. The impulse is followed; and the swift emergence of the  transcendental sense <a name="page_181"><font size="1" color="green">p. 181</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ii-Page_181"></a> results. This  “unwonted visitation” effects an abrupt and involuntary  alteration in the subject’s consciousness: whereby he literally  “finds himself another man.” He is as one who has slept  and now awakes. The crystallization of this new, at first fluid  apprehension of Reality in the form of vision and audition: the  pointing of the moral, the direct application of truth to the awakened  self, follow. “And whilst he was thus moved, straightway—a  thing unheard of for long ages!—the painted image of Christ  Crucified spoke to him from out its pictured lips. And, calling him by  his name, “Francis,” it said, “go, repair My house,  the which as thou seest is falling into decay.” And Francis  trembled, being utterly amazed, and almost as it were carried away by  these words. And he prepared to obey, for he was wholly set on the  fulfilling of this commandment. But   <i>forasmuch as he felt that the change he had undergone was  ineffable,</i>    it becomes us to be silent concerning it. . . .” From this time  he “gave untiring toil to the repair of that Church. For though  the words which were said to him concerned that divine Church which  Christ bought with His own Blood, he would not hasten to such heights,  but little by little from things of the flesh would pass to those of  the Spirit.”   <a name="fr_352"></a><a href="#fn_352"><font size="1">353</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p27"></a>In a moment of time, Francis’s whole universe  has suffered complete rearrangement. There are no hesitations, no  uncertainties. The change, which he cannot describe, he knows to be  central for life. Not for a moment does he think of disobeying the  imperative voice which speaks to him from a higher plane of reality  and demands the sacrifice of his career.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p28"></a>Compare now with the experience of St. Francis that of  another great saint and mystic, who combined, as he did, the active  with the contemplative life. Catherine of Genoa, who seems to have  possessed from childhood a religious nature, was prepared for the  remaking of her consciousness by years of loneliness and depression,  the result of an unhappy marriage. She, like St. Francis—but in  sorrow rather than in joy—had oscillated between the world,  which did not soothe her, and religion, which helped her no more. At  last, she had sunk into a state of dull wretchedness, a hatred alike  of herself and of life.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p29"></a>Her emancipation was equally abrupt. In the year 1474,  she being twenty-six years old, “The day after the feast of St.  Benedict (at the instance of her sister that was a nun), Catherine  went to make her confession to the confessor of that nunnery; but she  was not disposed to do it. Then said her sister, ‘At least go  and recommend yourself to him, because he is a most worthy  religious’; and in fact he was a very holy man. And suddenly, as  she knelt before him, she received in her heart the wound of the  unmeasured Love <a name="page_182"><font size="1" color="green">p. 182</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ii-Page_182"></a> of God, with so clear a  vision of her own misery and her faults, and of the goodness of God,  that she almost fell upon the ground. And by these sensations of  infinite love, and of the offenses that had been done against this  most sweet God, she was so greatly drawn by purifying affection away  from the poor things of this world that she was almost beside herself,  and for this she cried inwardly with ardent love, ‘No more  world! no more sin!’ And at this point if she had possessed a  thousand worlds, she would have thrown all of them away. . . . And she  returned home, kindled and deeply wounded with so great a love of God,  the which had been shown her inwardly, with the sight of her own  wretchedness, that she seemed beside herself. And she shut herself in  a chamber, the most secluded she could find, with burning sighs. And  in this moment she was inwardly taught the whole practice of orison:  but her tongue could say naught but this—‘O Love, can it  be that thou has called me with so great a love, and made me to know  in one instant that which worlds cannot express?’” This  intuition of the Absolute was followed by an interior vision of Christ  bearing the Cross, which further increased her love and  self-abasement. “And she cried again, ‘O Love, no more  sins! no more sins!’ And her hatred of herself was more than she  could endure.”   <a name="fr_353"></a><a href="#fn_353"><font size="1">354</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p31"></a>Of this experience Von Hügel says, “If the  tests of reality in such things are their persistence and large and  rich spiritual applicability and fruitfulness, then something  profoundly real and important took place in the soul of that sad and  weary woman of six-and-twenty, within that convent-chapel, at that  Annunciation-tide.”   <a name="fr_354"></a><a href="#fn_354"><font size="1">355</font></a>
     It is certain that for St. Catherine, as for St. Francis, an utterly  new life did, literally, begin at this point. The centre of interest  was shifted and the field of consciousness remade. She “knew in  an instant that which words cannot express.” Some veil about her  heart was torn away; so abruptly, that it left a wound behind. For the  first time she saw and knew the Love in which life is bathed; and all  the energy and passion of a strong nature responded to its call.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p33"></a>The conversion of Madame Guyon to the mystic life, as  told by herself in the eighth chapter of Part I. of her  Autobiography—“How a holy Religious caused her to find God  within her heart, with Admirable Results,” is its characteristic  title—is curiously like a dilute version of this experience of  St. Catherine’s. It, too, followed upon a period of mental  distress; also the result of an uncongenial marriage. But since Madame  Guyon’s unbalanced, diffuse, and sentimental character entirely  lacks the richness and dignity, the repressed ardours and exquisite  delicacy of <a name="page_183"><font size="1" color="green">p. 183</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ii-Page_183"></a> St. Catherine’s mind,  so, too, her account of her own interior processes is marred by a  terrible and unctuous interest in the peculiar graces vouchsafed to  her.   <a name="fr_355"></a><a href="#fn_355"><font size="1">356</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p35"></a>Madame Guyon’s value to the student of mysticism  partly consists in this feeble quality of her surface-intelligence,  which hence had little or no modifying or contributory effect upon her  spiritual life and makes her an ideal “laboratory  specimen” for the religious psychologist. True to her great  principle of passivity or “quiet,” it lets the  uncriticized interior impulses have their way; thus we are able to  observe their workings uncomplicated by the presence of a vigorous  intellect or a disciplined will. The wind that bloweth where it  listeth whistles through her soul: and the response which she makes is  that of a weathercock rather than a windmill. She moves to every  current; she often mistakes a draught for the divine breath; she feels  her gyrations to be of enormous importance. But in the description of  her awakening to the deeper life, even her effusive style acquires a  certain dignity.   <a name="fr_356"></a><a href="#fn_356"><font size="1">357</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p37"></a>Madame Guyon had from her childhood exhibited an  almost tiresome taste for pious observances. At twelve years old she  studied St. François de Sales and St. Jeanne Françoise de  Chantal; begged her confessor to teach her the art of mental prayer;  and when he omitted to do so, tried to teach herself, but without  result.   <a name="fr_357"></a><a href="#fn_357"><font size="1">358</font></a>
     She wished at this time to become a nun of the Visitation, as St.  Catherine at the same age wanted to be an Augustinian canoness; but as  the longings of little girls of twelve for the cloister are seldom  taken seriously, we are not surprised to find the refusal of her  parents’ consent chronicled in the chapter which is headed   <i>“</i>    <a name="an_iv.ii-p38.1"></a>   <i>Diverses croix chez M. son père</i>     <i>.”</i>    Growing up into an unusually beautiful young woman, she went into  society, and for a short time enjoyed life in an almost worldly way.  Her marriage with Jacques Guyon, however—a marriage of which she  signed the articles without even being told the bridegroom’s  name—put an end to her gaiety. “The whole town was pleased  by this marriage; and in all this rejoicing only I was sad . . .  hardly was I married, when the remembrance of my old desire to be a  nun overcame me.”   <a name="fr_358"></a><a href="#fn_358"><font size="1">359</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p40"></a>Her early married life was excessively unhappy. She  was soon <a name="page_184"><font size="1" color="green">p. 184</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ii-Page_184"></a> driven to look for comfort in  the practices of religion. “Made to love much, and finding  nothing to love around her, she gave her love to God,” says  Guerrier tersely.   <a name="fr_359"></a><a href="#fn_359"><font size="1">360</font></a>
     But she was not satisfied: like most of her fellow-contemplatives,  she was already vaguely conscious of something that she missed, some  vital power unused, and identified this something with the  “orison of quiet,” the “practice of the presence of  God” which mystically minded friends had described to her. She  tried to attain to it deliberately, and naturally failed. “I  could not give myself by multiplicity that which Thou Thyself givest,  and which is only experienced in simplicity.”   <a name="fr_360"></a><a href="#fn_360"><font size="1">361</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p43"></a>When these interior struggles had lasted for nearly  two years, and Madame Guyon was nineteen, the long desired, almost  despaired of, apprehension came—as it did to St.  Catherine—suddenly, magically almost; and under curiously  parallel conditions. It was the result of a few words spoken by a  Franciscan friar whom a “secret force” acting in her  interest had brought into the neighbourhood, and whom she had been  advised to consult. He was a recluse, who disliked hearing the  confessions of women, and appears to have been far from pleased by her  visit; an annoyance which he afterwards attributed to her fashionable  appearance, “which filled him with apprehension.”  “He hardly came forward, and was a long time without speaking to  me. I, however, did not fail to speak to him and to tell him in a few  words my difficulties on the subject of orison. He at once replied,  ‘Madame, you are seeking without that which you have within.  Accustom yourself to seek God in your own heart, and you will find  him.’ Having said this, he left me. The next morning he was  greatly astonished when I again visited him and told him the effect  which these words had had upon my soul: for, indeed, they were as an  arrow, which pierced my heart through and through. I felt in this  moment a   <i>profound wound,</i>    which was full of delight and of love—a wound so sweet that I  desired that it might never heal. These words had put into my heart  that which I sought for so many years, or, rather, they caused me to  find that which was there. O, my Lord, you were within my heart, and  you asked of me only that I should return within, in order that I  might feel your presence. O, Infinite Goodness, you were so near, and  I running here and there to seek you, found you not!” She, too,  like St. Catherine, learned in this instant the long-sought practice  of orison, or contemplation. “From the moment of which I have  spoken, my orison was emptied of all form, species, and images;  nothing of my orison passed through the mind; but it was an orison of  joyous possession in the Will, where the taste for God was so great,  pure, <a name="page_185"><font size="1" color="green">p. 185</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ii-Page_185"></a> and simple that it attracted and  absorbed the two other powers of the soul in a profound recollection  without action or speech.”   <a name="fr_361"></a><a href="#fn_361"><font size="1">362</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p45"></a>Take now the case of a less eminent mystic, who has  also left behind him a vivid personal description of his entrance upon  the Mystic Way. Rulman Merswin was a wealthy, pious, and respected  merchant of Strassburg. In the year 1347, when he was about thirty-six  years old, he retired from business in order that he might wholly  devote himself to religious matters. It was the time of that spiritual  revival within the Catholic Church in Germany which, largely  influenced by the great Rhenish mystics Suso and Tauler, is identified  with the “Friends of God”; and Merswin himself was one of  Tauler’s disciples.   <a name="fr_362"></a><a href="#fn_362"><font size="1">363</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p47"></a>One evening, in the autumn which followed his  retirement, “about the time of Martinmas,” he was  strolling in his garden alone. Meditating as he walked, a picture of  the Crucifix suddenly presented itself to his mind. In such an  imaginary vision as this there is nothing, of course, that we can call  abnormal. The thoughts of a devout Catholic, influenced by Tauler and  his school, must often have taken such a direction during his solitary  strolls. This time, however, the mental image of the Cross seems to  have released subconscious forces which had long been gathering way.  Merswin was abruptly filled with a violent hatred of the world and of  his own free-will. “Lifting his eyes to heaven he solemnly swore  that he would utterly surrender his own will, person, and goods to the  service of God.”   <a name="fr_363"></a><a href="#fn_363"><font size="1">364</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p49"></a>This act of complete surrender, releasing as it were  the earthbound self, was at once followed by the onset of pure  mystical perception. “The reply from on high came quickly. A  brilliant light shone about him: he heard in his ears a divine voice  of <a name="page_186"><font size="1" color="green">p. 186</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ii-Page_186"></a> adorable sweetness; he felt as if he  were lifted from the ground and carried several times completely round  his garden.”   <a name="fr_364"></a><a href="#fn_364"><font size="1">365</font></a>
     Optical disturbance, auditions, and the sense of levitation, are of  course frequent physical accompaniments of these shiftings of the  level of consciousness. There are few cases in which one or other is  not present; and in some we find all. Coming to himself after this  experience, Merswin’s heart was filled by a new consciousness of  the Divine; and by a transport of intense love towards God which made  him undertake with great energy the acts of mortification which he  believed necessary to the purification of his soul. From this time  onwards, his mystical consciousness steadily developed. That it was a  consciousness wholly different in kind from the sincere piety which  had previously caused him to retire from business in order to devote  himself to religious truth, is proved by the name of   <i>Conversion</i>    which he applies to the vision of the garden; and by the fact that he  dates from this point the beginning of his real life.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p51"></a>The conversion of Merswin’s greater  contemporary, Suso, seems to have been less abrupt. Of its first stage  he speaks vaguely at the beginning of his autobiography, wherein he  says that “he began to be converted when in the eighteenth year  of his age.”   <a name="fr_365"></a><a href="#fn_365"><font size="1">366</font></a>
     He was at this time, as St. Francis had been, restless, dissatisfied;  vaguely conscious of something essential to his peace, as yet unfound.  His temperament, at once deeply human and ardently spiritual,  passionately appreciative of sensuous beauty yet unable to rest in it,  had not “unified itself”: nor did it do so completely  until after a period of purgation which is probably unequalled for its  austerity in the history of the mysticism of the West. “He was  kept of God in this, that when he turned to those things that most  enticed him he found neither happiness nor peace therein. He was  restless, and-it seemed to him that something which was as yet unknown  could alone give peace to his heart. And he suffered greatly of this  restlessness. . . . God at last delivered him by a complete  conversion. His brothers in religion were astonished by so quick a  change: for the event took them unawares. Some said of it one thing,  and some another: but none could know the reason of his conversion. It  was God Who,   <i>by a</i>      <i>hidden light,</i>    had caused this return to Himself.”   <a name="fr_366"></a><a href="#fn_366"><font size="1">367</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p54"></a>This secret conversion was completed by a more violent  uprush of the now awakened and active transcendental powers. Suso,  whom one can imagine as a great and highly nervous artist if his  <a name="page_187"><font size="1" color="green">p. 187</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ii-Page_187"></a> genius had not taken the channel of  sanctity instead, was subject all his life to visions of peculiar  richness and beauty. Often these visions seem to have floated up, as  it were, from the subliminal region without disturbing the course of  his conscious life; and to be little more than pictorial images of his  ardour towards and intuition of, divine realities. The great ecstatic  vision—or rather apprehension—with which the series opens,  however, is of a very different kind; and represents the  characteristic experience of Ecstasy in its fullest form. It is  described with a detail and intensity which make it a particularly  valuable document of the mystical life. It is doubtful whether Suso  ever   <i>saw</i>    more than this: the course of his long education rather consisted in  an adjustment of his nature to the Reality which he then  perceived.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p55"></a>“In the first days of his conversion it happened  upon the Feast of St. Agnes, when the Convent had breakfasted at  midday, that the Servitor went into the choir. He was alone, and he  placed himself in the last stall on the prior’s side. And he was  in much suffering, for a heavy trouble weighed upon his heart. And  being there alone, and devoid of all consolations—no one by his  side, no one near him—of a sudden his soul was rapt in his body,  or out of his body. Then did he see and hear that which no tongue can  express.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p56"></a>“That which the Servitor saw had no form neither  any manner of being; yet he had of it a joy such as he might have  known in the seeing of the shapes and substances of all joyful things.  His heart was hungry, yet satisfied, his soul was full of contentment  and joy: his prayers and hopes were all fulfilled. And the Friar could  do naught but contemplate this Shining Brightness, and he altogether  forgot himself and all other things. Was it day or night? He knew not.  It was, as it were, a manifestation of the sweetness of Eternal Life  in the sensations of silence and of rest. Then he said, ‘If that  which I see and feel be not the Kingdom of Heaven, I know not what it  can be: for it is very sure that the endurance of all possible pains  were but a poor price to pay for the eternal possession of so great a  joy.’”</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p57"></a>The physical accompaniments of ecstasy were also  present. “This ecstasy lasted from half an hour to an hour, and  whether his soul were in the body or out of the body he could not  tell. But when he came to his senses it seemed to him that he returned  from another world. And so greatly did his body suffer in this short  rapture that it seemed to him that none, even in dying, could suffer  so greatly in so short a time. The Servitor came to himself moaning,  and he fell down upon the ground like a man who swoons. And he cried  inwardly, heaving great sighs from the depth of his soul and saying,  ‘Oh, my God, where was I and where <a name="page_188"><font size="1" color="green">p. 188</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ii-Page_188"></a> am I?’ And again, ‘Oh, my  heart’s joy, never shall my soul forget this hour!’ He  walked, but it was but his body that walked, as a machine might do.  None knew from his demeanour that which was taking place within. But  his soul and his spirit were full of marvels; heavenly lightnings  passed and repassed in the deeps of his being, and it seemed to him  that he walked on air. And all the powers of his soul were full of  these heavenly delights. He was like a vase from which one has taken a  precious ointment, but in which the perfume long remains.”</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p58"></a>Finally, the last phrases of the chapter seem to  suggest the true position of this exalted pleasure-state as a first  link in the long chain of mystical development. “This foretaste  of the happiness of heaven,” he says, “the which the  Servitor enjoyed for many days, excited in him a most lively desire  for God.”   <a name="fr_367"></a><a href="#fn_367"><font size="1">368</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p60"></a>Mystical activity, then, like all other activities of  the self, opens with that sharp stimulation of the will, which can  only be obtained through the emotional life.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p61"></a>Suso was a scholar, and an embryo ecclesiastic. During  the period which elapsed between his conversion and his description of  it, he was a disciple of Meister Eckhart, a student of Dionysius and  St. Thomas Aquinas. His writings show familiarity with the categories  of mystical theology; and naturally enough this circumstance, and also  the fact that they were written for purposes of edification, may have  dictated to some extent the language in which his conversion-ecstasy  is described. As against this, I will give two first-hand descriptions  of mystical conversion in which it is obvious that theological  learning plays little or no part. Both written in France within a few  years of one another, they represent the impact of Reality on two  minds of very different calibre. One is the secret document in which a  great genius set down, in words intended only for his own eyes, the  record of a two hours’ ecstasy. The other is the plain,  unvarnished statement of an uneducated man of the peasant class. The  first is, of course, the celebrated Memorial, or Amulet, of Pascal;  the second is the Relation of Brother Lawrence.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p62"></a>The Memorial of Pascal is a scrap of parchment on  which, round a rough drawing of the Flaming Cross, there are written a  few strange phrases, abrupt and broken words; all we know about one of  the strangest ecstatic revelations chronicled in the history of the  mystic type. After Pascal’s death a servant found a copy of this  little document, now lost, sewn up in his doublet. He seems always to  have worn it upon his person: a perpetual memorial of the supernal  experience, the initiation into Reality, which it describes. Though  Bremand has shown that the opening <a name="page_189"><font size="1" color="green">p. 189</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ii-Page_189"></a> of  Pascal’s spiritual eyes had begun, on his own declaration,  eleven months earlier, <a name="an_iv.ii-p62.1"></a> “d’une  manière douce et obligeante,”   <a name="fr_368"></a><a href="#fn_368"><font size="1">369</font></a>
     the conversion thus prepared was only made actual by this abrupt  illumination; ending a long period of spiritual stress, in which  indifference to his ordinary interests was counterbalanced by an utter  inability to feel the attractive force of that Divine Reality which  his great mind discerned as the only adequate object of desire.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p64"></a>The Memorial opens thus:—</p>    
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p65"></a>“L’an de  grace 1654</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p66"></a>lundi, 23 novembre, jour de Saint Clément,  pape</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p67"></a>et martyr, et autres au martyrologe,</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p68"></a>veille de Saint Chrysogone, martyr et autres</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p69"></a>depuis environ dix heures et demie du soir  jusques</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p70"></a>environ minuit et demie,</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p71"></a>Feu.”</p>    
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p72"></a>“From half-past ten till half-past twelve,  Fire!” That is all, so far as description is concerned; but  enough, apparently, to remind the initiate of all that passed. The  rest tells us only the passion of joy and conviction which this  nameless revelation—this long, blazing vision of  Reality—brought in its train. It is but a series of amazed  exclamations, crude, breathless words, placed there helter-skelter,  the artist in him utterly in abeyance; the names of the overpowering  emotions which swept him, one after the other, as the Fire of Love  disclosed its secrets, evoked an answering flame of humility and  rapture in his soul.</p>   <blockquote><a name="an_iv.ii-p72.1"></a> “Dieu  d’Abraham, Dieu d’Isaac, Dieu de Jacob,<br>   Non des philosophes et des savants.<br>   Certitude. Certitude. Sentiment. Joie.  Paix”.<br>  </blockquote>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p73"></a>“Not the God of philosophers and of  scholars!” cries in amazement this great scholar and philosopher  abruptly turned from knowledge to love.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p74"></a>“Oubli du monde et de tout hormis Dieu,”  he says again, seeing his universe suddenly swept clean of all but  this Transcendent Fact. Then, <a name="an_iv.ii-p74.1"></a> “Le  monde ne t’a point connu,   <i>mais je t’ai connu.</i>    Joie! joie joie! pleurs de joie!” Compare with  the classic style, the sharp and lucid definition of the  “Pensées,” the irony and glitter of the  “Provinciales,” these little broken phrases—this  child-like stammering speech—in which a supreme master of  language has tried to tell his wonder and his delight. I know few  things in the history of mysticism at once more convincing, more  poignant than this hidden talisman; upon which the brilliant <a name="page_190"><font size="1" color="green">p. 190</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ii-Page_190"></a> scholar and stylist, the merciless disputant,  has jotted down in hard, crude words, which yet seem charged with  passion—the inarticulate language of love—a memorial of  the certitude, the peace, the joy, above all, the reiterated,  all-surpassing joy, which accompanied his ecstatic apprehension of  God.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p75"></a>“ <a name="an_iv.ii-p75.1"></a> Mon Dieu, me  quitterez vous?” he says again; the fire  apparently beginning to die down, the ecstasy drawing to an end.  “ <a name="an_iv.ii-p75.2"></a> Que je n’en sois pas  séparé éternellement!” “Are  you going to leave me? Oh, let me not be separated from you for  ever!—the one unendurable thought which would, said Aquinas, rob  the Beatific Vision of its glory, were we not sure that it can never  fade.   <a name="fr_369"></a><a href="#fn_369"><font size="1">370</font></a>
     But the rhapsody is over, the vision of the Fire has gone; and the  rest of the Memorial clearly contains Pascal’s meditations upon  his experience, rather than a transcript of the experience itself. It  ends with the watchword of all mysticism, Surrender—“  <a name="an_iv.ii-p76.1"></a> Renonciation, totale et  douce” in Pascal’s words—the only  way, he thinks, in which he can avoid continued separation from  Reality.   <a name="fr_370"></a><a href="#fn_370"><font size="1">371</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p78"></a>Pascal’s vision of Light, Life, and Love was  highly ecstatic; an indescribable, incommunicable experience, which  can only be suggested by his broken words of certitude and joy. By his  simple contemporary, Brother Lawrence, that Transcendent Reality Who  “is not the God of philosophers and scholars,” was  perceived in a moment of abrupt intuition, peculiarly direct,  unecstatic and untheological in type, but absolutely enduring in its  results. Lawrence was an uneducated young man of the peasant class;  who first served as a soldier, and afterwards as a footman in a great  French family, where he annoyed his masters by breaking everything.  When he was between fifty and sixty years of age, he entered the  Carmelite Order as a lay brother; and the letters, “spiritual  maxims,” and conversations belonging to this period of his life  were published after his death in 1691. “He told me,” says  the anonymous reporter of the conversations, supposed to be M.  Beaufort, who was about 1660 Grand Vicar to the Cardinal de Noailles,  “that God had done him a singular favour in his conversion at  the age of eighteen. That in the winter, seeing a tree stripped of its  leaves, and considering that within a little time the leaves would be  renewed, and after that the flowers and fruit appear, he received a  high view of the Providence and Power of God, which has never since  been effaced from his soul. That this <a name="page_191"><font size="1" color="green">p. 191</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ii-Page_191"></a>  view had set him perfectly loose from the world and kindled in him  such a love for God that he could not tell whether it had increased in  above forty years that he had lived since.”   <a name="fr_371"></a><a href="#fn_371"><font size="1">372</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p80"></a>Such use of visible nature as the stuff of ontological  perceptions, the medium whereby the self reaches out to the Absolute,  is not rare in the history of mysticism. The mysterious vitality of  trees, the silent magic of the forest, the strange and steady cycle of  its life, possess in a peculiar degree this power of unleashing the  human soul: are curiously friendly to its cravings, minister to its  inarticulate needs. Unsullied by the corroding touch of consciousness,  that life can make a contact with the “great life of the  All”; and through its mighty rhythms man can receive a message  concerning the true and timeless World of “all that is, and was,  and evermore shall be.” Plant life of all kinds, indeed, from  the “flower in the crannied wall” to the “Woods of  Westermain” can easily become, for selves of a certain type, a  “mode of the Infinite.” So obvious does this appear when  we study the history of the mystics, that Steiner has drawn from it  the hardly warrantable inference that “plants are just those  natural phenomena whose qualities in the higher world are similar to  their qualities in the physical world.”   <a name="fr_372"></a><a href="#fn_372"><font size="1">373</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p82"></a>Though the conclusion be not convincing, the fact  remains. The flowery garment of the world is for some mystics a medium  of ineffable perception, a source of exalted joy, the veritable  clothing of God. I need hardly add that such a state of things has  always been found incredible by common sense. “The tree which  moves some to tears of joy,” says Blake, who possessed in an  eminent degree this form of sacramental perception, “is in the  Eyes of others only a green thing that stands in the Way.”   <a name="fr_373"></a><a href="#fn_373"><font size="1">374</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p84"></a>Such a perception of the Divine in Nature, of the true  and holy meaning of that rich, unresting life in which we are  immersed, is really a more usual feature of Illumination than of  Conversion. All the most marked examples of it must be referred to  that state; and will be discussed when we come to its consideration.  Sometimes, however, as in the case of Brother Lawrence, the first  awakening of the self to consciousness of Reality does take this form.  The Uncreated Light manifests Itself in and through created things.  This characteristically immanental discovery of the Absolute occurs  chiefly in two classes: in unlettered men who have lived close to  Nature, and to whom her symbols are more familiar than those of the  Churches or the schools, and in temperaments of the mixed or mystical  type, who are nearer to the poet than to the true contemplative, for  whom as a rule the Absolute <a name="page_192"><font size="1" color="green">p. 192</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ii-Page_192"></a> “hath  no image.” “It was like entering into another world, a new  state of existence,” says a witness quoted by Starbuck, speaking  of his own conversion. “Natural objects were glorified. My  spiritual vision was so clarified that I saw beauty in every material  object in the universe. The woods were vocal with heavenly  music.” “Oh, how I was changed! Everything became new. My  horses and hogs and everybody became changed!” exclaims with  naive astonishment another in the same collection.   <a name="fr_374"></a><a href="#fn_374"><font size="1">375</font></a>
     “When I went in the morning into the fields to work,”  says a third, “the glory of God appeared in all His visible  creation. I well remember we reaped oats, and how every straw and head  of the oats seemed, as it were, arrayed in a kind of rainbow glory, or  to glow, if I may so express it, in the glory of God.”   <a name="fr_375"></a><a href="#fn_375"><font size="1">376</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p87"></a>Amongst modern men, Walt Whitman possessed in a  supreme degree the permanent sense of this glory, the “light  rare, untellable, lighting the very light.”   <a name="fr_376"></a><a href="#fn_376"><font size="1">377</font></a>
     But evidences of its existence, and the sporadic power of  apprehending it, are scattered up and down the literature of the  world. Its discovery constitutes the awakening of the mystical  consciousness in respect of the World of Becoming: a sharp and sudden  break with the old and obvious way of seeing things. The human  cinematograph has somehow changed its rhythm, and begins to register  new and more real aspects of the external world. With this, the  self’s first escape from the limitations of its conventional  universe, it receives an immense assurance of a great and veritable  life surrounding, sustaining, explaining its own. Thus Richard  Jefferies says, of the same age as that at which Suso and Brother  Lawrence awoke to sudden consciousness of Reality, “I was not  more than eighteen when an inner and esoteric meaning began to come to  me from all the visible universe.” “I now became lost, and  absorbed into the being or existence of the universe . . . and losing  thus my separateness of being, came to seem like a part of the  whole.” “I feel on the margin of a life unknown, very  near, almost touching it—on the verge of powers which, if I  could grasp, would give men an immense breadth of existence.”   <a name="fr_377"></a><a href="#fn_377"><font size="1">378</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p90"></a>What was this “life unknown” but the Life  known to the great mystics, which Richard Jefferies apprehended in  these moments of insight, yet somehow contrived to miss?</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p91"></a>Such participation in the deep realities of the World  of Becoming, the boundless existence of a divine whole—which a  modern <a name="page_193"><font size="1" color="green">p. 193</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ii-Page_193"></a> psychologist has labelled and  described as “Cosmic Consciousness”   <a name="fr_378"></a><a href="#fn_378"><font size="1">379</font></a>
    —whilst it is not the final object of the mystic’s  journey, is a constant feature of it. It may represent one-half of his  characteristic consciousness: an entrance into communion with the  second of the Triune Powers of God, the Word which “is through  all things everlastingly.” Jefferies stood, as so many  mystically minded men have done, upon the verge of such a  transcendental life. The “heavenly door,” as Rolle calls  it, was ajar but not pushed wide. He peeped through it to the greater  world beyond; but, unable to escape from the bonds of his selfhood, he  did not pass through to live upon the independent spiritual plane.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p93"></a>Rolle, Jefferies’s fellow countryman, and his  predecessor by close upon six hundred years in the ecstatic love and  understanding of natural things, shall be our last example of the  mystical awakening. He, like his spiritual brother St. Francis, and  other typical cases, had passed through a preliminary period of  struggle and oscillation between worldly life and a vague but growing  spirituality: between the superficial and the deeper self. “My  youth was fond, my childhood vain, my young age unclean,”   <a name="fr_379"></a><a href="#fn_379"><font size="1">380</font></a>
     but “when I should flourish unhappily, and youth of wakeful age  was now come, the grace of my Maker was near, the which lust of  temporal shape restrained, and unto ghostly supplications turned my  desires, and the soul, from low things lifted, to heaven has  borne.”   <a name="fr_380"></a><a href="#fn_380"><font size="1">381</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p96"></a>The real “life-changing,” however, was  sharply and characteristically marked off from this preparatory state.  Rolle associates it with the state which he calls “Heat”:  the form in which his ardour of soul was translated to the surface  consciousness. “Heat soothly I call when the mind truly is  kindled in Love Everlasting, and the heart on the same manner to burn  not hopingly but verily is felt. The heart truly turned into fire,  gives feeling of burning love.”   <a name="fr_381"></a><a href="#fn_381"><font size="1">382</font></a>
     This burning heat is not merely a mental experience. In it we seem to  have an unusual but not unique form of psychophysical parallelism: a  bodily expression of the psychic travail and distress accompanying the  “New Birth.”   <a name="fr_382"></a><a href="#fn_382"><font size="1">383</font></a>
     “More have I marvelled than I show, forsooth,” he says in  his prologue, “when I first felt my heart wax warm, and truly,   <i>not imaginingly, but as it were with a sensible fire</i>   , burned. I was forsooth marvelled, as this burning burst up in my  soul, and of an unwonted solace; for <a name="page_194"><font size="1" color="green">p. 194</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ii-Page_194"></a> in  my ignorance of such healing abundance, oft have I groped my breast,  seeing whether this burning were of any bodily cause outwardly. But  when I knew that only it was kindled of ghostly cause inwardly, and  this burning was naught of fleshly love or desire, in this I conceived  it was the gift of my Maker.”   <a name="fr_383"></a><a href="#fn_383"><font size="1">384</font></a>
     Further on, he gives another and more detailed account. “From  the beginning, forsooth, of my life-changing and of my mind, to the  opening of the heavenly door which Thy Face showed, that the heart  might behold heavenly things and see by what way its Love it might  seek and busily desire, three years are run except three months or  four. The door, forsooth, biding open, a year near-by I passed unto  the time in which the heat of Love Everlasting was verily felt in  heart. I sat forsooth in a chapel and whilst with sweetness of prayer  and meditation greatly I was delighted, suddenly in me I felt a merry  heat and unknown. But at first I wondered, doubting of whom it should  be; but a long time I am assured that not of the Creature but of my  Maker it was, for more hot and gladder I found it.”   <a name="fr_384"></a><a href="#fn_384"><font size="1">385</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p101"></a>To this we must add a passage which I cannot but think  one of the most beautiful expressions of spiritual joy to be found in  mystical literature. Based though it certainly is upon a passage in  St. Augustine—for the nightingale is not a Yorkshire  bird—its sketch of the ideal mystic life, to the cultivation of  which he then set himself, reveals in a few lines the most charming  aspect of Rolle’s spirituality, its poetic fervour, its capacity  for ardent love.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p102"></a>“In the beginning truly of my conversion and  singular purpose, I though I would be like the little bird that for  love of her lover longs, but in her longing she is gladdened when he  comes that she loves. And joying she sings, and singing she longs, but  in sweetness and heat. It is said the nightingale to song and melody  all night is given, that she may please him to whom she is joined. How  muckle more with greatest sweetness to Christ my Jesu should I sing,  that is spouse of my soul by all this present life, that is night in  regard of clearness to come.”   <a name="fr_385"></a><a href="#fn_385"><font size="1">386</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p104"></a>Glancing back at the few cases here brought together,  we can see in them, I think, certain similarities and diversities  which are often of great psychological interest and importance: and  have their influence upon the subsequent development of the mystic  life. We see in particular at this point—before purification, or  the remaking of character, begins—the reaction of the natural  self, its heart and its mind, upon that uprush of new truth which  operates “mystical conversion.” This reaction is highly  significant, <a name="page_195"><font size="1" color="green">p. 195</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ii-Page_195"></a> and gives us a clue not  only to the future development of the mystic, but to the general  nature of man’s spiritual consciousness.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p105"></a>We have said   <a name="fr_386"></a><a href="#fn_386"><font size="1">387</font></a>
     that this consciousness in its full development seems to be extended  not in one but in two directions. These directions, these two  fundamental ways of apprehending Reality may be called the eternal and  temporal, transcendent and immanent, absolute and dynamic aspects of  Truth. They comprise the twofold knowledge of a God Who is both Being  and Becoming near and far: pairs of opposites which the developed  mystical experience will carry up into a higher synthesis. But the  first awakening of the mystic sense, the first breaking in of the  suprasensible upon the soul, commonly involves the emergence of one  only of these complementary forms of perception. One side always wakes  first: the incoming message always choosing the path of least  resistance. Hence mystical conversion tends to belong to one of two  distinctive types: tends also, as regards its expression, to follow  that temperamental inclination to objectivize Reality as a Place, a  Person, or a State which we found to govern the symbolic systems of  the mystics.   <a name="fr_387"></a><a href="#fn_387"><font size="1">388</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p108"></a>There is first, then, the apprehension of a splendour  without: an expansive, formless, ineffable vision, a snatching up of  the self, as it were, from knowledge of this world to some vague yet  veritable knowledge of the next. The veil parts, and the Godhead is  perceived as transcendent to, yet immanent in, the created universe.  Not the personal touch of love transfiguring the soul, but the  impersonal glory of a transfigured world, is the dominant note of this  experience: and the reaction of the self takes the form of awe and  rapture rather than of intimate affection. Of such a kind was the  conversion of Suso, and in a less degree of Brother Lawrence. Of this  kind also were the Light which Rulman Merswin saw, and the mystical  perception of the Being of the universe reported by Richard Jefferies  and countless others.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p109"></a>This experience, if it is to be complete, if it is to  involve the definite emergence of the self from “the prison of  I-hood,” its setting out upon the Mystic Way, requires an act of  concentration on the self’s part as the complement of its  initial act of expansion. It must pass beyond the stage of  metaphysical rapture or fluid splendour, and crystallize into a willed  response to the Reality perceived; a definite and personal relation  must be set up between the self and the Absolute Life. To be a  spectator of Reality is not enough. The awakened subject is not merely  to perceive transcendent life, but to participate therein; and for  this, a drastic and costly life-changing is required. In  Jefferies’s case this crystallization, this heroic effort  towards participation did not take place, and <a name="page_196"><font size="1" color="green">p. 196</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ii-Page_196"></a> he never therefore laid hold of “the  glory that has been revealed.” In Suso’s it did,  “exciting in him a most lively desire for God.”</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p110"></a>In most cases this crystallization, the personal and  imperative concept which the mind constructs from the general and  ineffable intuition of Reality, assumes a theological character. Often  it presents itself to the consciousness in the form of visions or  voices: objective, as the Crucifix which spoke to St. Francis, or  mental, as the visions of the Cross experienced by Rulman Merswin and  St. Catherine of Genoa. Nearly always, this concept, this intimate  realization of the divine, has reference to the love and sorrow at the  heart of things, the discord between Perfect Love and an imperfect  world; whereas the complementary vision of Transcendence strikes a  note of rapturous joy. “The beatings of the Heart of God sounded  like so many invitations which thus spake: Come and do penance, come  and be reconciled, come and be consoled, come and be blessed; come, My  love, and receive all that the Beloved can give to His beloved. . . .  Come, My bride, and enjoy My Godhead.”   <a name="fr_388"></a><a href="#fn_388"><font size="1">389</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p112"></a>It is to this personal touch, to the individual appeal  of an immediate Presence, not to the great light and the Beatific  Vision, that the awakened self makes its most ardent, most heroic  response. Not because he was rapt from himself, but because the figure  on the Cross called him by name, saying, “Repair My  Church” did St. Francis, with that simplicity, that disregard of  worldly values which constituted his strength, accept the message in a  literal sense and set himself instantly to the work demanded; bringing  stones, and, in defiance alike of comfort and convention, building up  with his own hands the crumbling walls.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p113"></a>In many conversions to the mystic life, the revelation  of an external splendour, the shining vision of the transcendent  spiritual world, is wholly absent. The self awakes to that which is  within, rather than to that which is without: to the immanent not the  transcendent God, to the personal not the cosmic relation. Where those  who look out receive the revelation of Divine Beauty, those who look  in receive rather the wound of Divine Love: another aspect of the  “triple star.” Emotional mystics such as Richard Rolle and  Madame Guyon give us this experience in an extreme form. We find in  St. Catherine of Genoa a nobler example of the same type of response.  That inward revelation in its anguish and abruptness, its rending  apart of the hard tissues of I-hood and vivid disclosures of the  poverty of the finite self, seemed, says the legend of St. Catherine  “the wound of Unmeasured Love,” an image in which we seem  to hear the very accents of the saint. “A wound full of  delight,” says the effusive Madame Guyon, “I wished that  it <a name="page_197"><font size="1" color="green">p. 197</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ii-Page_197"></a> might never heal.” Rolle calls  this piercing rapture a great heat: the heat which is to light the  Fire of Love. “As it were if the finger were put in fire, it  should be clad with feeling of burning so the soul with love (as  aforesaid) set afire, truly feels most very heat.”   <a name="fr_389"></a><a href="#fn_389"><font size="1">390</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p115"></a>Love, passionate and all-dominant, here takes the  place of that joyous awe which we noticed as the characteristic  reaction upon reality in conversions of the Transcendent type. In the  deep and strong temperaments of the great mystics this love passes  quickly—sometimes instantly—from the emotional to the  volitional stage. Their response to the voice of the Absolute is not  merely an effusion of sentiment, but an act of will: an act often of  so deep and comprehensive a kind as to involve the complete change of  the outward no less than of the inward life. “Divine  love,” says Dionysius “draws those whom it seizes beyond  themselves: and this so greatly that they belong no longer to  themselves but wholly to the Object loved.”   <a name="fr_390"></a><a href="#fn_390"><font size="1">391</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p117"></a>Merswin’s oath of self-surrender: St. Catherine  of Genoa’s passionate and decisive “No more world! no more  sins!”: St. Francis’s naive and instant devotion to  church-restoration in its most literal sense: these things are  earnests of the reality of the change. They represent—symbolize  as well as they can upon the sensual plane—the spontaneous  response of the living organism to a fresh external stimulus: its  first effort of adjustment to the new conditions which that stimulus  represents. They complete the process of conversion; which is not  one-sided, not merely an infusion into the surface-consciousness of  new truth, but rather the beginning of a life-process, a breaking down  of the old and building up of the new. A never to be ended  give-and-take is set up between the individual and the Absolute. The  Spirit of Life has been born: and the first word it learns to say is   <i>Abba,</i>    Father. It aspires to its origin, to Life in its most intense  manifestation: hence all its instincts urge it to that activity which  it feels to be inseparable from life. It knows itself a member of that  mighty family in which the stars are numbered: the family of the sons  of God, who, free and creative, sharing the rapture of a living,  striving Cosmos, “shout for joy.”</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ii-p118"></a>So, even in its very beginning, we see how active, how  profoundly organic, how deeply and widely alive is the true  contemplative life; how truly on the transcendent as on the phenomenal  plane, the law of living things is action and reaction, force and  energy. The awakening of the self is to a new and more active plane of  being, new and more personal relations with Reality; hence to a new  and more real work which it must do.</p>

The parallel    between their early years is so exact and descends to such minute    details that I am inclined to think that the knowledge of this    resemblance, and the gratification with which she would naturally    regard it, has governed or modified her memories of this past. Hence    a curious and hitherto unnoticed case of “unconscious    spiritual plagiarism.”</p>

 </p><p><a name="an_iv.ii-p48"></a>          A. Jundt, “Rulman Merswin,” p. 19. M. Jundt has    condensed his account which I here translate, from Merswin’s    autobiographical story of his conversion, published in     <i>Breiträge zu den theologischen Wissenschaften</i>     , v    .      (Jena, 1854). Our whole knowledge of Merswin’s existence    depends on the group of documents which includes this confession,    the “Book of Two Men,” the “Vision of Nine    Rocks,” and his other reputed works. The authenticity of these    documents has been much questioned, and they have doubtless suffered    severely from the editorial energy of his followers. Some critics    even regard them as pious fictions, useless as evidence of the    incidents of Merswin’s life. With this view, upheld by Karl    Reider (“Der Gottesfreund von Oberland,” 1905), I cannot    agree. A possible solution of the many difficulties is that of M.    Jundt, who believes that we have in Merswin and the mysterious    “Friend of God of the Oberland,” who pervades his    spiritual career, a remarkable case of dissociated personality.    Merswin’s peculiar psychic make up, as described in his    autobiography, supports this view: the adoption of which I shall    assume in future references to his life. It is incredible that the    vivid account of his conversion which I quote should be merely    “tendency-literature,” without basis in fact. Compare    Jundt’s monograph, and also Rufus Jones,     <i>op. cit.</i>      pp    .      245-253, where the whole problem is discussed.</p>
