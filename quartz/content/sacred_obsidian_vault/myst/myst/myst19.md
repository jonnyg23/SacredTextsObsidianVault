 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p1"></a>Since<a name="an_iv.viii-p1.1"></a> the object of all contemplation is the production of that state of  intimate communion in which the mystics declare that the self is  “in God and God is in her,” it might be supposed that the  orison of union represented the end of mystical activity, in so far as  it is concerned with the attainment of a transitory but exalted  consciousness of “oneness with the Absolute.” Nearly all  the great contemplatives, however, describe as a distinct, and regard  as a more advanced phase of the spiritual consciousness, the group of  definitely ecstatic states in which the concentration of interest on  the Transcendent is so complete, the gathering up and pouring out of  life on this one point so intense, that the subject is more or less  entranced, and becomes, for the time of the ecstasy, unconscious of  the external world. In ordinary contemplation he refused to attend to  that external world: it was there, a blurred image, at the fringe of  his conscious field, but he deliberately left it on one side. In  ecstasy he   <i>cannot</i>    attend to it. None of its messages reach him: not even those most  insistent of all messages which are translated into the terms of  bodily pain.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p2"></a>All mystics agree in regarding such ecstasy as an  exceptionally favourable state; the one in which man’s spirit is  caught up to the most immediate union with the divine. The word has  become a synonym for joyous exaltation, for the inebriation of the  Infinite. <a name="page_359"><font size="1" color="green">p. 359</font></a> <a name="an_iv.viii-Page_359"></a> The induced ecstasies of the Dionysian  mysteries, the metaphysical raptures of the Neoplatonists, the  voluntary or involuntary trance of Indian mystics and Christian  saints—all these, however widely they may differ in  transcendental value, agree in claiming such value, in declaring that  this change in the quality of consciousness brought with it a valid  and ineffable apprehension of the Real. Clearly, this apprehension  will vary in quality and content with the place of the subject in the  spiritual scale. The ecstasy is merely the psycho-physical condition  which accompanies it. “It is hardly a paradox to say,”  says Myers, “that the evidence for ecstasy is stronger than the  evidence for any other religious belief. Of all the subjective  experiences of religion, ecstasy is that which has been most urgently,  perhaps to the psychologist most convincingly asserted; and it is not  confined to any one religion. . . . From the medicine man of the  lowest savages up to St. John, St. Peter, and St. Paul, with Buddha  and Mahomet on the way, we find records which, though morally and  intellectually much differing, are in psychological essence the  same.”   <a name="fr_731"></a><a href="#fn_731"><font size="1">732</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p4"></a>There are three distinct aspects under which the  ecstatic state may be studied: (  <i>a</i>   ) the physical, (  <i>b</i>   ) the psychological, (  <i>c</i>   ) the mystical. Many of the deplorable misunderstandings and still  more deplorable mutual recriminations which surround its discussion  come from the refusal of experts in one of these three branches to  consider the results arrived at by the other two.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p5"></a>A. Physically considered, ecstasy is a trance; more or  less deep, more or less prolonged. The subject may slide into it  gradually from a period of absorption in, or contemplation of, some  idea which has filled the field of consciousness: or, it may come on  suddenly, the appearance of the idea—or even some word or symbol  suggesting the idea—abruptly throwing the subject into an  entranced condition. This is the state which some mystical writers  call Rapture. The distinction, however, is a conventional one: and the  works of the mystics describe many intermediate forms.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p6"></a>During the trance, breathing and circulation are  depressed. The body is more or less cold and rigid, remaining in the  exact position which it occupied at the oncoming of the ecstasy,  however difficult and unnatural this pose may be. Sometimes  entrancement is so deep that there is complete anaesthesia, as in the  case which I quote from the life of St. Catherine of Siena.   <a name="fr_732"></a><a href="#fn_732"><font size="1">733</font></a>
     Credible witnesses report that Bernadette, the visionary of Lourdes,  held the flaming end of a candle in her hand for fifteen minutes  during one of her ecstasies. She felt no pain, neither did the flesh  show any marks <a name="page_360"><font size="1" color="green">p. 360</font></a> <a name="an_iv.viii-Page_360"></a> of burning. Similar instances of  ecstatic anesthesia abound in the lives of the saints, and are also  characteristic of certain pathological states.   <a name="fr_733"></a><a href="#fn_733"><font size="1">734</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p9"></a>The trance includes, according to the testimony of the  ecstatics, two distinct phases—(  <i>a</i>   ) the short period of lucidity and (  <i>b</i>   ) a longer period of complete unconsciousness, which may pass into a  death like catalepsy, lasting for hours; or, as once with St. Teresa,  for days. “The difference between union and trance,” says  Teresa, “is this: that the latter lasts longer and is more  visible outwardly, because the breathing gradually diminishes, so that  it becomes impossible to speak or to open the eyes. And though this  very thing occurs when the soul is in union, there is more violence in  a trance, for the natural warmth vanishes, I know not how, when the  rapture is deep, and in all these kinds of orison there is more or  less of this. When it is deep, as I was saying, the hands become cold  and sometimes stiff and straight as pieces of wood; as to the body if  the rapture comes on when it is standing or kneeling it remains so;  and the soul is so full of the joy of that which Our Lord is setting  before it, that it seems to forget to animate the body and abandons  it. If the rapture lasts, the nerves are made to feel it.”   <a name="fr_734"></a><a href="#fn_734"><font size="1">735</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p11"></a>Such ecstasy as this, so far as its physical symptoms  go, is not of course the peculiar privilege of the mystics. It is an  abnormal bodily state, caused by a psychic state: and this causal  psychic state may be healthy or unhealthy, the result of genius or  disease. It is common in the little understood type of personality  called “sensitive” or mediumistic: it is a well-known  symptom of certain mental and nervous illnesses. A feeble mind  concentrated on one idea—like a hypnotic subject gazing at one  spot—easily becomes entranced; however trivial the idea which  gained possession of his consciousness. Apart from its content, then,  ecstasy carries no guarantee of spiritual value. It merely indicates  the presence of certain abnormal psycho-physical conditions: an  alteration of the normal equilibrium, a shifting of the threshold of  consciousness, which leaves the body, and the whole usual  “external world” outside instead of inside the conscious  field, and even affects those physical functions—such as  breathing—which are almost entirely automatic. Thus ecstasy,  physically considered, may occur in any person in whom (1) the  threshold of consciousness is exceptionally mobile and (2) there is a  tendency to dwell upon one governing idea or intuition. Its worth  depends entirely on the objective value of that idea or intuition.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p12"></a>In the hysterical patient, thanks to an unhealthy  condition of the centres of consciousness, any trivial or irrational  idea, any <a name="page_361"><font size="1" color="green">p. 361</font></a> <a name="an_iv.viii-Page_361"></a> one of the odds and ends stored up in the  subliminal region, may thus become fixed, dominate the mind, and  produce entrancement. Such ecstasy is an illness: the emphasis is on  the pathological state which makes it possible. In the mystic, the  idea which fills his life is so great a one—the idea of  God—that, in proportion as it is vivid, real, and intimate, it  inevitably tends to monopolize the field of consciousness. Here the  emphasis is on the overpowering strength of spirit, not on the feeble  and unhealthy state of body or mind.   <a name="fr_735"></a><a href="#fn_735"><font size="1">736</font></a>
     This true ecstasy, says Godferneaux, is not a malady, but “the  extreme form of a state which must be classed amongst the ordinary  accidents of conscious life.”   <a name="fr_736"></a><a href="#fn_736"><font size="1">737</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p15"></a>The mystics themselves are fully aware of the  importance of this distinction. Ecstasies, no less than visions and  voices, must they declare, be subjected to unsparing criticism before  they are recognized as divine: whilst some are undoubtedly “of  God,” others are no less clearly “of the devil.”  “The great doctors of the mystic life,” says Malaval,  “teach that there are two sorts of rapture, which must be  carefully distinguished. The first are produced in persons but little  advanced in the Way, and still full of selfhood; either by the force  of a heated imagination which vividly apprehends a sensible object, or  by the artifice of the Devil. These are the raptures which St. Teresa  calls, in various parts of her works, Raptures of Feminine Weakness.  The other sort of Rapture is, on the contrary, the effect of pure  intellectual vision in those who have a great and generous love for  God. To generous souls who have utterly renounced themselves, God  never fails in these raptures to communicate high things.”   <a name="fr_737"></a><a href="#fn_737"><font size="1">738</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p17"></a>All the mystics agree with Malaval in finding the test  of a true ecstasy, not in its outward sign, but in its inward grace,  its after-value: and here psychology would do well to follow their  example. The ecstatic states, which are supreme instances of the close  connection between body and soul, have bodily as well as mental  results: and those results are as different and as characteristic as  those observed in healthy and in morbid organic processes. If the  concentration has been upon the highest centre of consciousness, the  organ of spiritual perception—if a door has really been opened  by which the self has escaped for an instant to the vision of That  Which Is—the ecstasy will be good for life. The entrancement of  <a name="page_362"><font size="1" color="green">p. 362</font></a> <a name="an_iv.viii-Page_362"></a> disease, on the contrary is always bad for life.  Its concentration being upon the lower instead of the higher levels of  mentality, it depresses rather than enhances the vitality, the  fervour, or the intelligence of its subject: and leaves behind it an  enfeebled will, and often moral and intellectual chaos.   <a name="fr_738"></a><a href="#fn_738"><font size="1">739</font></a>
     “Ecstasies that do not produce considerable profit either to  the persons themselves or others, deserve to be suspected,” says  Augustine Baker, “and when any marks of their approaching are  perceived, the persons ought to divert their minds some other  way.”   <a name="fr_739"></a><a href="#fn_739"><font size="1">740</font></a>
     It is the difference between a healthy appetite for nourishing food  and a morbid craving for garbage. The same organs of digestion are  used in satisfying both: yet he would be a hardy physiologist who  undertook to discredit all nutrition by a reference to its degenerate  forms.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p20"></a>Sometimes both kinds of ecstasy, the healthy and the  psychopathic, are seen in the same person. Thus in the cases of St.  Catherine of Genoa and St. Catherine of Siena it would seem that as  their health became feebler and the nervous instability always found  in persons of genius increased, their ecstasies became more frequent;  but these were not healthy ecstasies, such as those which they  experienced in the earlier stages of their careers, and which brought  with them an access of vitality. They were the results of increasing  weakness of body, not of the overpowering strength of the spirit: and  there is evidence that Catherine of Genoa, that acute self-critic, was  conscious of this. “Those who attended on her did not know how  to distinguish one state from the other. And hence on coming to; she  would sometimes say, ‘Why did you let me remain in this  quietude, from which I have almost died?’”   <a name="fr_740"></a><a href="#fn_740"><font size="1">741</font></a>
     Her earlier ecstasies, on the contrary, had in a high degree the  positive character of exaltation and life-enhancement consequent upon  extreme concentration on the Absolute; as well as the merely negative  character of annihilation of the surface-consciousness. She came from  them with renewed health and strength, as from a resting in heavenly  places and a feeding on heavenly food: and side by side with this  ecstatic life, fulfilled the innumerable duties of her active vocation  as hospital matron and spiritual mother of a large group of disciples.  “Many times,” says her legend, “she would hide  herself in some secret place and there stay: and being sought she was  found upon the ground, her face hidden in her hands, altogether beyond  herself, in such a state of joy as is beyond thought or speech: and  being called—yea, even in a loud voice—she heard not. And  at other times she would go up and down. . . . <a name="page_363"><font size="1" color="green">p. 363</font></a> <a name="an_iv.viii-Page_363"></a> as  if beyond herself, drawn by the impulse of love, she did this. And  certain other times she remained for the space of six hours as if  dead: but hearing herself called, suddenly she got up, and answering  she would at once go about all that needed to be done even the  humblest things.   <a name="fr_741"></a><a href="#fn_741"><font size="1">742</font></a>
     And in thus leaving the All, she went without any grief, because she  fled all selfhood (<i>la proprietà</i>)    as if it were the devil. And when she came forth from her  hiding-place her face was rosy as it might be a cherub’s; and it  seemed as if she might have said, ‘Who shall separate me from  the love of God?’”   <a name="fr_742"></a><a href="#fn_742"><font size="1">743</font></a>
     “Very often,” says St. Teresa, describing the results of  such rapturous communion with Pure Love as that from which St.  Catherine came joyous and rosy-faced, “he who was before sickly  and full of pain comes forth healthy and even with new strength: for  it is something great that is given to the soul in rapture.”   <a name="fr_743"></a><a href="#fn_743"><font size="1">744</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p25"></a>B. Psychologically considered, all ecstasy is a  form—the most perfect form—of the state which is  technically called “complete mono-ideism,” That withdrawal  of consciousness from circumference to centre, that deliberate  attention to   <i>one thing</i>   , which we discussed in Recollection, is here pushed—voluntarily  or involuntarily—to its logical conclusion. It is (1) always  paid for by psycho-physical disturbances; (2) rewarded in healthy  cases by an enormous lucidity, a supreme intuition in regard to the  one thing on which the self’s interest has been set.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p26"></a>Such ecstasy, then, is an exalted form of  contemplation, and might be expected in appropriate subjects to  develop naturally from that state. “A simple difference of  degree,” says Maury, “separates ecstasy from the action of  forcibly fixing an idea in the mind. Contemplation implies exercise of  will, and the power of interrupting the extreme tension of the mind.  In ecstasy, which is contemplation carried to its highest pitch, the  will, although in the strictest sense able to provoke the state, is  nevertheless unable to suspend it.”   <a name="fr_744"></a><a href="#fn_744"><font size="1">745</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p28"></a>In “complete mono-ideism” then, the  attention to one thing and the inattention to all else, is so entire  that the subject is entranced. Consciousness has been withdrawn from  those centres which receive and respond to the messages of the  external world: he neither sees, feels, nor hears. The <a name="an_iv.viii-p28.1"></a>   <i>Ego dormio et cor meum vigilat</i>     of the contemplative ceases to be a metaphor, and  becomes a realistic description. It must be remembered that the whole  trend <a name="page_364"><font size="1" color="green">p. 364</font></a> <a name="an_iv.viii-Page_364"></a> of mystical education has been toward the  production of this fixity of attention. Recollection and Quiet lead up  to it. Contemplation cannot take place without it. All the mystics  assure us that a unification of consciousness, in which all outward  things are forgot, is the necessary prelude of union with the Divine;  for consciousness of the Many and consciousness of the One are  mutually exclusive states. Ecstasy, for the psychologist, is such a  unification in its extreme form. The absorption of the self in the one  idea, the one desire, is so profound—and in the case of the  great mystics so impassioned—that everything else is blotted  out. The tide of life is withdrawn, not only from those higher centres  which are the seats of perception and of thought, but also from those  lower centres which govern the physical life. The whole vitality of  the subject is so concentrated on the transcendental world—or,  in a morbid ecstatic, on the idea which dominates his mind—that  body and brain alike are depleted of their energy in the interests of  this supreme act.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p29"></a>Since mystics have, as a rule, the extreme  susceptibility to suggestions and impressions which is characteristic  of artistic and creative types, it is not surprising that their  ecstasies are often evoked, abruptly, by the exhibition of, or  concentration upon, some loved and special symbol of the divine. Such  symbols form the rallying-points about which are gathered a whole  group of ideas and intuitions. Their presence—sometimes the  sudden thought of them—will be enough, in psychological  language, to provoke a discharge of energy along some particular path:  that is to say, to stir to life all those ideas and intuitions which  belong to the self’s consciousness of the Absolute, to  concentrate vitality on them, and introduce the self into that world  of perception of which they are, as it were, the material keys. Hence  the profound significance of symbols for some mystics: their  paradoxical clinging to outward forms, whilst declaring that the  spiritual and intangible alone is real.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p30"></a>For the Christian mystics, the sacraments and  mysteries of faith have always provided such a   <i>point d’appui</i>;   and these often play a large part in the production of their  ecstasies. For St. Catherine of Siena, and also very often for her  namesake of Genoa, the reception of Holy Communion was the prelude to  ecstasy. Julian of Norwich   <a name="fr_745"></a><a href="#fn_745"><font size="1">746</font></a>
     and St. Francis of Assissi   <a name="fr_746"></a><a href="#fn_746"><font size="1">747</font></a>
     became entranced whilst gazing on the crucifix. We are told of Denis  the Carthusian that towards the end of his life, hearing the   <i>Veni Creator</i>    or certain verses of the psalms, he was at once rapt in God and  lifted up from the earth.   <a name="fr_747"></a><a href="#fn_747"><font size="1">748</font></a>
     <a name="page_365"><font size="1" color="green">p. 365</font></a> <a name="an_iv.viii-Page_365"></a></p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p34"></a>Of St. Catherine of Siena, her biographer says that  “she used to communicate with such fervour that immediately  afterwards she would pass into the state of ecstasy, in which for  hours she would be totally unconscious. On one occasion, finding her  in this condition, they (the Dominican friars) forcibly threw her out  of the church at midday, and left her in the heat of the sun watched  over by some of her companions till she came to her senses.”  Another, “catching sight of her in the church when she was in  ecstasy, came down and pricked her in many places with a needle.  Catherine was not aroused in the least from her trance, but  afterwards, when she came back to her senses, she felt the pain in her  body and perceived that she had thus been wounded.”   <a name="fr_748"></a><a href="#fn_748"><font size="1">749</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p36"></a>It is interesting to compare with this objective  description, the subjective account of ecstatic union which St.  Catherine gives in her “Divine Dialogue.” Here, the deeper  self of the mystic is giving in a dramatic form its own account of its  inward experiences: hence we see the inward side of that outward state  of entrancement, which was all that onlookers were able to perceive.  As usual in the Dialogue, the intuitive perceptions of the deeper self  are attributed by St. Catherine to the Divine Voice speaking in her  soul.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p37"></a>“Oftentimes, through the perfect union which the  soul has made with Me, she is raised from the earth almost as if the  heavy body became light. But this does not mean that the heaviness of  the body is taken away, but that the union of the soul with Me is more  perfect than the union of the body with the soul; wherefore the  strength of the spirit, united with Me, raises the weight of the body  from the earth, leaving it as if immoveable and all pulled to pieces  in the affection of the soul. Thou rememberest to have heard it said  of some creatures, that were it not for My Goodness, in seeking  strength for them, they would not be able to live; and I would tell  thee that, in the fact that the souls of some do not leave their  bodies, is to be seen a greater miracle than in the fact that some  have arisen from the dead, so great is the union which they have with  Me. I, therefore, sometimes for a space withdraw from the union,  making the soul return to the vessel of her body . . . from which she  was separated by the affection of love. From the body she did not  depart, because that cannot be except in death; the bodily powers  alone departed, becoming united to Me through affection of love. The  memory is full of nothing but Me, the intellect, elevated, gazes upon  the object of My Truth; the affection, which follows the intellect,  loves and becomes united with that which the intellect sees. These  powers being united and gathered together and immersed and inflamed in  Me, the body loses its <a name="page_366"><font size="1" color="green">p. 366</font></a> <a name="an_iv.viii-Page_366"></a> feeling, so that the seeing  eye sees not, and the hearing ear hears not, and the tongue does not  speak; except as the abundance of the heart will sometimes permit it,  for the alleviation of the heart and the praise and glory of My Name.  The hand does not touch and the feet walk not, because the members are  bound with the sentiment of Love.”   <a name="fr_749"></a><a href="#fn_749"><font size="1">750</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p39"></a>A healthy ecstasy so deep as this seems to be the  exclusive prerogative of the mystics: perhaps because so great a  passion, so profound a concentration, can be produced by nothing  smaller than their flaming love of God. But as the technique of  contemplation is employed more or less consciously by all types of  creative genius—by inventors and philosophers, by poets,  prophets, and musicians, by all the followers of the “Triple  Star,” no less than by the mystic saints—so too this  apotheosis of contemplation, the ecstatic state, sometimes appears in  a less violent form, acting healthily and normally, in artistic and  creative personalities at a complete stage of development. It may  accompany the prophetic intuitions of the seer, the lucidity of the  great metaphysician, the artist’s supreme perception of beauty  or truth. As the saint is “caught up to God,” so these are  “caught up” to their vision: their partial apprehensions  of the Absolute Life. Those joyous, expansive outgoing sensations,  characteristic of the ecstatic consciousness, are theirs also. Their  greatest creations are translations to us, not of something they have  thought, but of something they have known, in a moment of ecstatic  union with the “great life of the All.”</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p40"></a>We begin, then, to think that the “pure  mono-ideism,” which the psychologist identifies with ecstasy,  though doubtless a part, is far from being the whole content of this  state, True, the ecstatic is absorbed in his one idea, his one love:  he is in it and with it: it fills his universe. But this unified state  of consciousness does not merely pore upon something already  possessed. When it only does this, it is diseased. Its true business  is pure perception. It is outgoing, expansive: its goal is something  beyond itself. The rearrangement of the psychic self which occurs in  ecstasy is not merely concerned with the normal elements of  consciousness. It is rather a temporary unification of consciousness  round that centre of transcendental perception which mystics call the  “apex” or the “spark of the soul.” Those  deeper layers of personality which normal life keeps below the  threshold are active in it: and these are fused with the surface  personality by the governing passion, the transcendent love which lies  at the basis of all sane ecstatic states. The result is not merely a  mind concentrated on one idea nor a heart fixed on one desire, nor  even a mind and a <a name="page_367"><font size="1" color="green">p. 367</font></a> <a name="an_iv.viii-Page_367"></a> heart united in the interests of  a beloved thought: but a whole being welded into one, all its  faculties, neglecting their normal universe, grouped about a new  centre, serving a new life, and piercing like a single flame the  barriers of the sensual world. Ecstasy is the psycho-physical state  which may accompany this brief synthetic act.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p41"></a>C. Therefore, whilst on its physical side ecstasy is  an entrancement, on its mental side a complete unification of  consciousness, on its mystical side it is an exalted act of  perception. It represents the greatest possible extension of the  spiritual consciousness in the direction of Pure Being: the  “blind intent stretching” here receives its reward in a  profound experience of Eternal Life. In this experience the  departmental activities of thought and feeling the consciousness of  I-hood, of space and time—all that belongs to the World of  Becoming and our own place therein—are suspended. The vitality  which we are accustomed to split amongst these various things, is  gathered up to form a state of “pure apprehension”: a  vivid intuition of—or if you like conjunction with—the  Transcendent. For the time of his ecstasy the mystic is, for all  practical purposes, as truly living in the supersensual world as the  normal human animal is living in the sensual world. He is experiencing  the highest and most joyous of those temporary and unstable  states—those “passive unions”—in which his  consciousness escapes the limitations of the senses, rises to freedom,  and is united for an instant with the “great life of the  All.”</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p42"></a>Ecstasy, then, from the contemplative’s point of  view, is the development and completion of the orison of union, and he  is not always at pains to distinguish the two degrees, a fact which  adds greatly to the difficulties of students.   <a name="fr_750"></a><a href="#fn_750"><font size="1">751</font></a>
     In both states—though he may, for want of better language,  describe his experience in terms of sight—the Transcendent is  perceived by contact, not by vision: as, enfolded in darkness with one  whom we love, we obtain a knowledge far more complete than that  conferred by the sharpest sight the most perfect mental analysis. In  Ecstasy, the apprehension is perhaps more definitely  “beatific” than in the orison of union. Such memory of his  feeling-state as the ecstatic brings back with him is more often  concerned with an exultant certainty—a conviction that he has  known for once the Reality which hath no image, and solved the paradox  of life—than with meek self-loss in that Cloud of Unknowing  where the contemplative in union is content to meet his Beloved. The  true note of ecstasy, however, its only valid distinction from infused  contemplation, lies in <a name="page_368"><font size="1" color="green">p. 368</font></a> <a name="an_iv.viii-Page_368"></a>   <i>entrancement;</i>    in “being ravished out of fleshly feeling,” as St. Paul  caught up to the Third Heaven,   <a name="fr_751"></a><a href="#fn_751"><font size="1">752</font></a>
     not in “the lifting of mind unto God.” This, of course,  is an outward distinction only, and a rough one at that, since  entrancement has many degrees: but it will be found the only practical  basis of classification.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p45"></a>Probably none but those who have experienced these  states know the actual difference between them. Even St.  Teresa’s psychological insight fails her here, and she is  obliged to fall back on the difference between voluntary and  involuntary absorption in the divine: a difference, not in spiritual  values, but merely in the psycho-physical constitution of those who  have perceived these values. “I wish I could explain with the  help of God,” she says, “wherein union differs from  rapture, or from transport, or from flight of the spirit, as they call  it, or from trance, which are all one. I mean that all these are only  different names for that   <i>one and the same thing, which is also called ecstasy.</i>    It is more excellent than union, the fruits of it are much greater,  and its other operations more manifold, for union is uniform in the  beginning, the middle, and the end, and is so also interiorly; but as  raptures have ends of a much higher kind, they produce effects both  within and without [  <i>i.e.</i>   , both physical and psychical]. . . . A rapture is absolutely  irresistible; whilst union, inasmuch as we are then on our own ground,  may be hindered, though that resistance be painful and violent.”   <a name="fr_752"></a><a href="#fn_752"><font size="1">753</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p47"></a>From the point of view of mystical psychology, our  interest in ecstasy will centre in two points. (1) What has the mystic  to tell us of the Object of his ecstatic perception? (2) What is the  nature of the peculiar consciousness which he enjoys in his trance?  That is to say, what news does he bring us as to the Being of God and  the powers of man?</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p48"></a>It may be said generally that on both these points he  bears out, amplifies, and expresses under formulae of greater  splendour, with an accent of greater conviction, the general testimony  of the contemplatives. In fact, we must never forget that an ecstatic  is really nothing else than a contemplative of a special kind, with a  special psycho-physical make-up. Moreover, we have seen that it is not  always easy to determine the exact point at which entrancement takes  place, and deep contemplation assumes the ecstatic form. The  classification, like all classifications of mental states, is an  arbitrary one. Whilst the extreme cases present no difficulty, there  are others less complete, which form a graduated series between the  deeps of the “Quiet” and the heights of  “Rapture.” We shall never know, for instance, whether the  ecstasies of Plotinus and of Pascal involved true bodily entrancement,  or <a name="page_369"><font size="1" color="green">p. 369</font></a> <a name="an_iv.viii-Page_369"></a> only a deep absorption of the  “unitive” kind. So, too, the language of many Christian  mystics when speaking of their “raptures” is so vague and  metaphorical that it leaves us in great doubt as to whether they mean  by Rapture the abrupt suspension of normal consciousness, or merely a  sudden and agreeable elevation of soul.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p49"></a>“Ravishing,” says Rolle, “as it is  showed, in two ways is to be understood. One manner, forsooth, in  which a man is ravished out of fleshly feeling; so that for the time  of his ravishing plainly he feels nought in flesh, nor what is done of  his flesh, and yet he is not dead but quick, for yet the soul to the  body gives life. And on this manner saints sometime are ravished, to  their profit and other men’s learning; as Paul ravished to the  third heaven. And on this manner sinners also in vision sometime are  ravished, that they may see joys of saints and pains of damned for  their correction.   <a name="fr_753"></a><a href="#fn_753"><font size="1">754</font></a>
     And many other as we read of. Another manner of ravishing there is,  that is lifting of mind into God by contemplation. And this manner of  ravishing is in all that are perfect lovers of God, and in none of  them but that love God. And as well this is called a ravishing as the  other; for with a violence it is done, and as it were against  nature.”   <a name="fr_754"></a><a href="#fn_754"><font size="1">755</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p52"></a>It is, however, very confusing to the anxious inquirer  when—as too often—“lifting of mind by  contemplation” is “as well called a ravishing as the  other,” and ecstasy is used as a synonym for gladness of heart.  Here, so far as is possible, these words will be confined to their  strict meaning, and not applied generally to the description of all  the outgoing and expansive states of the transcendental  consciousness.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p53"></a>What does the mystic claim that he attains in this  abnormal condition—this irresistible trance? The price that he  pays is heavy, involving much psycho-physical wear and tear. He  declares that his rapture or ecstasy includes a moment—often a  very short, and always an indescribable moment—in which he  enjoys a supreme knowledge of or participation in Divine Reality. He  tells us under various metaphors that he then attains Pure Being, his  Source, his Origin, his Beloved: “is engulphed in the very thing  for which he longs, which is God.”   <a name="fr_755"></a><a href="#fn_755"><font size="1">756</font></a>
     “Oh, wonder of wonders,” cries Eckhart, “when I  think of the union the soul has with God! He makes the enraptured soul  to flee out of herself, for she is no more satisfied with anything  that can be named. The spring of <a name="page_370"><font size="1" color="green">p. 370</font></a> <a name="an_iv.viii-Page_370"></a> Divine Love flows  out of the soul and draws her out of herself into the unnamed Being,  into her first source, which is God alone.”   <a name="fr_756"></a><a href="#fn_756"><font size="1">757</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p56"></a>This momentary attainment of the Source, the Origin,  is the theme of all descriptions of mystic ecstasy. In Rulman  Merswin’s “Book of the Nine Rocks,” that brief and  overwhelming rapture is the end of the pilgrim’s long trials and  ascents. “The vision of the Infinite lasted only for a moment:  when he came to himself he felt inundated with life and joy. He asked,  ‘Where have I been?’ and he was answered, ‘In the  upper school of the Holy Spirit. There you were surrounded by the  dazzling pages of the Book of Divine Wisdom.   <a name="fr_757"></a><a href="#fn_757"><font size="1">758</font></a>
     Your soul plunged therein with delight, and the Divine Master of the  school has filled her with an exuberant love by which even your  physical nature has been transfigured.’”   <a name="fr_758"></a><a href="#fn_758"><font size="1">759</font></a>
     Another Friend of God, Ellina von Crevelsheim, who was of so abnormal  a psychic constitution that her absorption in the Divine Love caused  her to remain dumb for seven years, was “touched by the Hand of  God” at the end of that period, and fell into a five-days’  ecstasy, in which “pure truth” was revealed to her, and  she was lifted up to an immediate experience of the Absolute. There  she “saw the interior of the Father’s heart,” and  was “bound with chains of love, enveloped in light, and filled  with peace and joy.”   <a name="fr_759"></a><a href="#fn_759"><font size="1">760</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p60"></a>In this transcendent act of union, the mystic  sometimes says that he is “conscious of nothing.” But it  is clear that this expression is figurative, for otherwise he would  not have known that there had been an act of union: were his  individuality abolished, it could not have been aware of its  attainment of God. What he appears to mean is that consciousness so  changes its form as to be no longer recognizable or describable in  human speech. In the paradoxical language of Richard of St. Victor,  “In a wondrous fashion remembering we do not remember, seeing we  do not see, understanding we not understand, penetrating we do not  penetrate.”   <a name="fr_760"></a><a href="#fn_760"><font size="1">761</font></a>
     In this indescribable but most actual state, the whole self, exalted  and at white heat, is unified and poured out in one vivid act of  impassioned perception, which leaves no room for reflection or  self-observation. That aloof “somewhat” in us which  watches all our actions, splits our consciousness, has been submerged.  The mystic is attending exclusively to Eternity, not to <a name="page_371"><font size="1" color="green">p. 371</font></a> <a name="an_iv.viii-Page_371"></a> his own perception of Eternity. That he can only consider  when the ecstasy itself is at an end.</p>   <blockquote><a name="an_iv.viii-p61.1"></a> “All things I then forgot,<br>   My cheek on Him Who for my coming came,<br>  </blockquote>  <blockquote><a name="an_iv.viii-p61.4"></a>   <i>All ceased, and I was not,</i><br>   Leaving my cares and shame<br>   Among the lilies, and forgetting them.” <a name="fr_761"></a><a href="#fn_761"><font size="1">762</font></a>
   <br>  </blockquote>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p63"></a>This is that perfect unity of consciousness, that  utter concentration on an experience of love, which excludes all  conceptual and analytic acts. Hence, when the mystic says that his  faculties were suspended, that he “knew all and knew  nought,” he really means that he was so concentrated on the  Absolute that he ceased to consider his separate existence: so merged  in it that he could not perceive it as an object of thought, as the  bird cannot see the air which supports it, nor the fish the ocean in  which it swims. He really “knows all” but  “thinks” nought: “perceives all,” but  “conceives nought.”</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p64"></a>The ecstatic consciousness is not self-conscious: it  is intuitive not discursive. Under the sway of a great passion,  possessed by a great Idea, it has become “a single state of  enormous intensity.”   <a name="fr_762"></a><a href="#fn_762"><font size="1">763</font></a>
     In this state, it transcends our ordinary processes of knowledge, and  plunges deep into the Heart of Reality. A fusion which is the  anticipation of the unitive life takes place: and the ecstatic returns  from this brief foretaste of freedom saying, “I know, as having  known, the meaning of Existence; the sane centre of the  universe—at once the wonder and the assurance of the  soul.”   <a name="fr_763"></a><a href="#fn_763"><font size="1">764</font></a>
     “This utter transformation of the soul in God,” says St.  Teresa, describing the same experience in the official language of  theology, “continues only for an instant: yet while it continues  no faculty of the soul is aware of it, or knows what is passing there.  Nor can it be understood while we are living on the earth; at least  God will not have us understand it, because we must be incapable of  understanding it.   <i>I know is</i>    by   <i>experience.</i>   ”   <a name="fr_764"></a><a href="#fn_764"><font size="1">765</font></a>
    Theutterances of those who know by experience are here of more worth  than all the statements of psychology, which are concerned of  necessity with the “outward signs” of this “inward  and spiritual grace.” To these we must go if we would obtain  some hint of that which ecstasy may mean to the ecstatic.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p68"></a>“When the soul, forgetting itself, dwells in  that radiant darkness,” says Suso, “it loses all its  faculties and all its qualities, as St. Bernard has said. And this,  more or less completely, according <a name="page_372"><font size="1" color="green">p. 372</font></a> <a name="an_iv.viii-Page_372"></a> to whether the  soul—whether in the body or out of the body—is more or  less united to God. This forgetfulness of self is, in a measure, a  transformation in God; who then becomes, in a certain manner, all  things for the soul, as Scripture saith. In this rapture the soul  disappears, but not yet entirely. It acquires, it is true, certain  qualities of divinity, but does not naturally become divine. . . . To  speak in the common language, the soul is rapt, by the divine power of  resplendent Being, above its natural faculties, into the nakedness of  the Nothing.”   <a name="fr_765"></a><a href="#fn_765"><font size="1">766</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p70"></a>Here Suso is trying to describe his rapturous  attainment of God in the negative terms of Dionysian theology. It is  probable that much of the language of that theology originated, not in  the abstract philosophizings, but in the actual ecstatic experience,  of the Neoplatonists, who—Christian and Pagan  alike—believed in, and sometimes deliberately induced, this  condition as the supreme method of attaining the One. The whole  Christian doctrine of ecstasy, on its metaphysical side, really  descends from that great practical transcendentalist Plotinus: who is  known to have been an ecstatic, and has left in his Sixth Ennead a  description of the mystical trance obviously based upon his own  experiences. “Then,” he says, “the soul neither  sees, nor distinguishes by seeing, nor imagines that there are two  things; but becomes as it were another thing, ceases to be itself and  belong to itself. It belongs to God and is one with Him, like two  concentric circles: concurring they are One; but when they separate,  they are two. . . . Since in this conjunction with Deity there were  not two things, but the perceiver was one with the thing perceived, if  a man could preserve the memory of what he was when he mingled with  the Divine, he would have within himself an image of God. . . . For  then nothing stirred within him, neither anger, nor desire, nor even  reason, nor a certain intellectual perception nor, in short, was he  himself moved, if we may assert this; but being in an ecstasy,  tranquil and alone with God, he enjoyed an unbreakable calm.”   <a name="fr_766"></a><a href="#fn_766"><font size="1">767</font></a>
     Ecstasy, says Plotinus in another part of the same treatise, is  “another mode of seeing, a simplification and abandonment of  oneself, a desire of contact, rest, and a striving after union.”  All the phases of the contemplative experience seem to be summed up in  this phrase.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p72"></a>It has been said by some critics that the ecstasy of  Plotinus was different in kind from the ecstasy of the Christian  saints: that it was a philosophic rhapsody, something like  Plato’s “saving madness,” which is also regarded on  somewhat insufficient evidence as being an affair of the head and  entirely unconnected with the heart. At first sight the arid  metaphysical language in which <a name="page_373"><font size="1" color="green">p. 373</font></a> <a name="an_iv.viii-Page_373"></a> Plotinus tries to  tell his love, offers some ground for this view. Nevertheless the  ecstasy itself is a practical matter; and has its root, not in reason,  but in a deep-seated passion for the Absolute which is far nearer to  the mystic’s love of God than to any intellectual curiosity,  however sublime. The few passages in which it is mentioned tell us  what his mystical genius drove him to do: and not what his  philosophical mind encouraged him to think or say. At once when we  come to these passages we notice a rise of temperature, an alteration  of values. Plotinus the ecstatic is sure whatever Plotinus the  metaphysician may think, that the union with God is a union of hearts:  that “by love He may be gotten and holden, but by thought  never.” He, no less than the mediaeval contemplatives, is  convinced—to quote his own words—that the Vision is only  for the desirous; for him who has that “loving passion”  which “causes the lover to rest in the object of his  love.”   <a name="fr_767"></a><a href="#fn_767"><font size="1">768</font></a>
     The simile of marriage, of conjunction as the soul’s highest  bliss, which we are sometimes told that we owe in part to the  unfortunate popularity of the Song of Songs, in part to the sexual  aberrations of celibate saints, is found in the work of this  hardheaded Pagan philosopher: who was as celebrated for his practical  kindness and robust common sense as for his transcendent intuitions of  the One.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p74"></a>The greatest of the Pagan ecstatics then, when  speaking from experience, anticipates the Christian contemplatives.  His words, too, when compared with theirs, show how delicate are the  shades which distinguish ecstasy such as this from the highest forms  of orison. “Tranquil and alone with God”—mingled for  an instant of time “like two concentric circles” with the  Divine Life,” “perceiver and perceived made  one”—this is as near as the subtle intellect of Alexandria  can come to the reality of that experience in which the impassioned  mono-ideism of great spiritual genius conquers the rebellious senses,  and becomes, if only for a moment, operative on the highest levels  accessible to the human soul. Self-mergence, then—that state of  transcendence in which, the barriers of selfhood abolished, we  “receive the communication of Life and of Beatitude, in which  all things are consummated and all things are renewed”   <a name="fr_768"></a><a href="#fn_768"><font size="1">769</font></a>
    —is the secret of ecstasy, as it was the secret of  contemplation. On their spiritual side the two states cannot, save for  convenience of description, be divided. Where contemplation becomes  expansive, out-going, self-giving, and receives a definite fruition of  the Absolute in return, its content is already ecstatic. Whether its  outward form shall be so depends on the body of the mystic, not on his  soul. <a name="page_374"><font size="1" color="green">p. 374</font></a> <a name="an_iv.viii-Page_374"></a></p>   <blockquote><a name="an_iv.viii-p75.1"></a> “Se l’ atto  della mente<br>   è tutto consopito,<br>   en Dio stando rapito,<br>   ch’ en sé non se retrova.<br>   . . . .<br>   En mezo de sto mare<br>   essendo sì abissato,<br>   giá non ce trova lato<br>   onde ne possa uscire,<br>   De sé non può pensare<br>   né dir como è formato,<br>   però che, trasformato,<br>   altro sí ha vestire.<br>   Tutto lo suo sentire<br>   en ben sí va notando,<br>   belleza contemplando<br>   la qual non ha colore.” <a name="fr_769"></a><a href="#fn_769"><font size="1">770</font></a>
   <br>  </blockquote>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p77"></a>Thus sang Jacopone da Todi of the ecstatic soul:  and here the descriptive powers of one who was both a poet and a  mystic bring life and light to the dry theories of psychology.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p78"></a>He continues—and here, in perhaps the finest of  all poetic descriptions of ecstasy, he seems to echo at one point  Plotinus, at another Richard of St. Victor: at once to veil and reveal  the utmost secrets of the mystic life:—</p>   <blockquote><a name="an_iv.viii-p78.1"></a> “Aperte son le  porte<br>   facta ha conjunzione,<br>   et e in possessione<br>   de tutto quel de Dio.<br>   Sente que non sentio,<br>   que non cognove vede,<br>   possede que non crede,<br>   gusta senza sapere.<br>   Però ch’ ha sé perduto<br>   tutto senza misura,<br>   possede quel’ altura<br>   de summa smesuranza.<br>   Perché non ha tenuto<br>   en sé altra mistura,<br>   quel ben senza figura<br>   recere en abondanza.” <a name="fr_770"></a><a href="#fn_770"><font size="1">771</font></a>
     <a name="page_375"><font size="1" color="green">p. 375</font></a> <a name="an_iv.viii-Page_375"></a><br>  </blockquote>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p80"></a>This ineffable “awareness,” <a name="an_iv.viii-p80.1"></a>   <i>en dio stando rapito</i>     <i>,</i>    this union with the Imageless Good, is not the only—though it  is the purest—form taken by ecstatic apprehension. Many of the  visions and voices described in a previous chapter were experienced in  the entranced or ecstatic state; generally when the first violence of  the rapture was passed. St. Francis and St. Catherine of Siena both  received the stigmata in ecstasy: almost all the entrancements of Suso  and many of those of St. Teresa and Angela of Foligno, entailed  symbolic vision, rather than pure perception of the Absolute. More and  more, then, we are forced to the opinion that ecstasy, in so far as it  is not a synonym for joyous and expansive contemplation, is really the  name of the outward condition rather than of any one kind of inward  experience.</p>   <h4 align="center"><a name="an_iv.viii-p80.2"></a>Rapture</h4>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p81"></a>In all the cases which we have been  considering—and they are characteristic of a large  group—the onset of ecstasy has been seen as a gradual, though  always involuntary process. Generally it has been the culminating  point of a period of contemplation. The self, absorbed in the orison  of quiet or of union, or some analogous concentration on its  transcendental interests, has passed over the limit of these states;  and slid into a still ecstatic trance, with its outward  characteristics of rigid limbs, cold, and depressed respiration.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p82"></a>The ecstasy, however, instead of developing naturally  from a state of intense absorption in the Divine Vision, may seize the  subject abruptly and irresistibly, when in his normal state of  consciousness. This is strictly what ascetic writers mean by Rapture.  We have seen that the essence of the mystic life consists in the  remaking of personality: its entrance into a conscious relation with  the Absolute. This process is accompanied in the mystic by the  development of an art expressive of his peculiar genius: the art of  contemplation. His practice of this art, like the practice of poetry,  music, or any other form of creation, may follow normal lines, at  first amenable to the control of his will, and always dependent on his  own deliberate attention to the supreme Object of his quest; that is  to say, on his orison. His mystic states, however they may end, will  owe their beginning to some voluntary act upon his part: a deliberate  response to the invitation of God, a turning from the visible to the  invisible world. Sometimes, however, his <a name="page_376"><font size="1" color="green">p. 376</font></a> <a name="an_iv.viii-Page_376"></a> genius for  the transcendent becomes too strong for the other elements of  character, and manifests itself in psychic disturbances—abrupt  and ungovernable invasions from the subliminal region—which make  its exercise parallel to the “fine frenzy” of the prophet,  the composer, or the poet. Such is   <i>Rapture:</i>    a violent and uncontrollable expression of genius for the Absolute,  which temporarily disorganizes and may permanently injure the nervous  system of the self. Often, but not necessarily, Rapture—like its  poetic equivalent—yields results of great splendour and value  for life. But it is an accident, not an implicit of mystical  experience: an indication of disharmony between the subject’s  psychophysical make-up and his transcendental powers.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p83"></a>Rapture, then, may accompany the whole development of  selves of an appropriate type. We have seen that it is a common  incident in mystical conversion. The violent uprush of subliminal  intuitions by which such conversion is marked disorganizes the normal  consciousness, overpowers the will and the senses, and entails a more  or less complete entrancement. This was certainly the case with Suso  and Rulman Merswin, and perhaps with Pascal: whose “Certitude,  Peace, Joy” sums up the exalted intuition of Perfection and  Reality—the conviction of a final and unforgettable  knowledge—which is characteristic of all ecstatic  perception.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p84"></a>In her Spiritual Relations, St. Teresa speaks in some  detail of the different phases or forms of expression of these violent  ecstatic states: trance, which in her system means that which we have  called ecstasy, and transport, or “flight of the spirit,”  which is the equivalent of rapture. “The difference between  trance and transport,” she says, “is this. In a trance the  soul gradually dies to outward things, losing the senses and living  unto God. But a transport comes on by one sole act of His Majesty,  wrought in the innermost part of the soul with such swiftness that it  is as if the higher part thereof were carried away, and the soul were  leaving the body.”   <a name="fr_771"></a><a href="#fn_771"><font size="1">772</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p86"></a>Rapture, says St. Teresa in another place,  “comes in general as a shock, quick and sharp, before you can  collect your thoughts, or help yourself in any way; and you see and  feel it as a cloud, or a strong eagle rising upwards and carrying you  away on its wings. I repeat it: you feel and see yourself carried  away, you know not whither.”   <a name="fr_772"></a><a href="#fn_772"><font size="1">773</font></a>
     This carrying-away sensation may even assume the concrete form which  is known as levitation: when the upward and outward sensations so  dominate the conscious field that the subject is convinced that she is  raised bodily from the ground. “It seemed to me, when I tried to  make some resistance, as if a great force beneath my feet lifted me  up. I know of nothing with which to compare it; but it was much more  violent than the other <a name="page_377"><font size="1" color="green">p. 377</font></a> <a name="an_iv.viii-Page_377"></a> spiritual visitations, and I  was therefore as one ground to pieces . . . And further, I confess  that it threw me into a great fear, very great indeed at first; for  when I saw my body thus lifted up from the earth, how could I help it?  Though the spirit draws it upwards after itself, and that with great  sweetness if unresisted, the senses are not lost;   <i>at least I was so much myself as to be able to see that I was being  lifted up</i>   .”   <a name="fr_773"></a><a href="#fn_773"><font size="1">774</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p89"></a>So Rulman Merswin said that in the rapture which  accompanied his conversion, he was carried round the garden with his  feet off the ground:   <a name="fr_774"></a><a href="#fn_774"><font size="1">775</font></a>
     and St. Catherine of Siena, in a passage which I have already quoted,  speaks of the strength of the spirit, which raises the body from the  earth.   <a name="fr_775"></a><a href="#fn_775"><font size="1">776</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p92"></a>The subjective nature of this feeling of levitation is  practically acknowledged by St. Teresa when she says, “When the  rapture was over, my body seemed frequently to be buoyant, as if all  weight had departed from it; so much so, that now and then I scarcely  knew that my feet touched the ground. But during the rapture the body  is very often as it were dead, perfectly powerless. It continues in  the position it was in when the rapture came upon it—if sitting,  sitting.” Obviously here the outward conditions of physical  immobility coexisted with the subjective sensation of being  “lifted Up.”   <a name="fr_776"></a><a href="#fn_776"><font size="1">777</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p94"></a>The self’s consciousness when in the condition  of rapture may vary from the complete possession of her faculties  claimed by St. Teresa to a complete entrancement. However abrupt the  oncoming of the transport, it does not follow that the mystic  instantly loses his surface-consciousness. “There remains the  power of seeing and hearing; but it is as if the things heard and seen  were at a great distance far away.”   <a name="fr_777"></a><a href="#fn_777"><font size="1">778</font></a>
     They have retreated, that is to say, to the fringe of the conscious  field, but may still remain just within it. Though the senses may not  be entirely entranced, however, it seems that the power of movement is  always lost. As in ecstasy, breathing and circulation are much  diminished.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p96"></a>“By the command of the Bridegroom when He  intends ravishing the soul,” says St. Teresa, “the doors  of the mansions and even those of the keep and of the whole castle are  closed; for He takes away the power of speech, and although  occasionally the other faculties are retained rather longer, no word  can be uttered. Sometimes the person is at once deprived of all the  senses, the <a name="page_378"><font size="1" color="green">p. 378</font></a> <a name="an_iv.viii-Page_378"></a> hands and body becoming as cold as if  the soul had fled; occasionally no breathing can be detected. This  condition lasts but a short while, I mean in the same degree, for when  this profound suspension diminishes the body seems to come to itself  and gain strength to return again to this  <i>death</i>    which gives more vigorous   <i>life</i>    to the soul.”   <a name="fr_778"></a><a href="#fn_778"><font size="1">779</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p98"></a>This spiritual storm, then, in St. Teresa’s  opinion, enhances the vitality of those who experience it: makes them  “more living than before.” It initiates them into  “heavenly secrets,” and if it does not do this it is no  “true rapture,” but a “physical weakness such as  women are prone to owing to their delicacy of constitution.” Its  sharpness and violence, however, leave considerable mental disorder  behind: “This supreme state of ecstasy never lasts long, but  although it ceases, it leaves the will so inebriated, and the mind so  transported out of itself that for a day, or sometimes for several  days, such a person is incapable of attending to anything but what  excites the will to the love of God; although wide awake enough to  this, she seems asleep as regards all earthly matters.”   <a name="fr_779"></a><a href="#fn_779"><font size="1">780</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p100"></a>But when equilibrium is re-established, the true  effects of this violent and beatific intuition of the Absolute begin  to invade the normal life. The self which has thus been caught up to  awareness of new levels of Reality, is stimulated to fresh activity by  the strength of its impressions. It now desires an eternal union with  that which it has known; with which for a brief moment it seemed to be  merged. The peculiar talent of the mystic—power of apprehending  Reality which his contemplations have ordered and developed, and his  ecstasies express—here reacts upon his life-process, his slow  journey from the Many to the One. His nostalgia has been increased by  a glimpse of the homeland. His intuitive apprehension of the Absolute,  which assumes in ecstasy its most positive form, spurs him on towards  that permanent union with the Divine which is his goal. “Such  great graces,” says St. Teresa, “leave the soul avid of  total possession of that Divine Bridegroom who has conferred  them.”   <a name="fr_780"></a><a href="#fn_780"><font size="1">781</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p102"></a>Hence the ecstatic states do not merely lift the self  to an abnormal degree of knowledge: they enrich her life, contribute  to the remaking of her consciousness, develop and uphold the  “strong and stormy love which drives her home.” They give  her the clearest vision she can have of that transcendent standard to  which she must conform: entail her sharpest consciousness of the  inflow of that Life on which her little striving life depends. Little  wonder, then, that—though the violence of the onset may often  <a name="page_379"><font size="1" color="green">p. 379</font></a> <a name="an_iv.viii-Page_379"></a> try his body to the full—the mystic comes  forth from a “good ecstasy” as Pascal from the experience  of the Fire, humbled yet exultant, marvellously strengthened; and  ready, not for any passive enjoyments, but rather for the struggles  and hardships of the Way, the deliberate pain and sacrifice of  love.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p103"></a>In the third Degree of Ardent Love, says Richard of  St. Victor, love paralyses action. Union   <i>(copula)</i>    is the symbol of this state: ecstasy is its expression. The desirous  soul, he says finely, no longer thirsts  <i>for</i>    God but   <i>into</i>    God. The pull of its desire draws it into the Infinite Sea. The mind  is borne away into the abyss of Divine Light; and, wholly forgetful of  exterior things, knows not even itself, but passes utterly into its  God. In this state, all earthly desire is absorbed in the heavenly  glory. “Whilst the mind is separated from itself, and whilst it  is borne away into the secret place of the divine mystery and is  surrounded on all sides by the fire of divine love, it is inwardly  penetrated and inflamed by this fire, and utterly puts off itself and  puts on a divine love: and being conformed to that Beauty which it has  beheld, it passes utterly into that other glory.”   <a name="fr_781"></a><a href="#fn_781"><font size="1">782</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.viii-p105"></a>Thus does the state of ecstasy contribute to the  business of deification; of the remaking of the soul’s susbtance  in conformity with the Goodness, Truth, and Beauty which is God,  “Being conformed to that Beauty which it has beheld, it passes  utterly into that other glory”; into the flaming heart of  Reality, the deep but dazzling darkness of its home.</p>

 </p><p><a name="an_iv.viii-p13"></a>          St. Thomas proves ecstasies to be inevitable on just this    psychological ground. “The higher our mind is raised to the    contemplation of spiritual things,” he says, “the more    it is abstracted from sensible things. But the final term to which    contemplation can possibly arrive is the divine substance. Therefore    the mind that sees the divine substance must be totally divorced    from the bodily senses, either by death or     <i>by</i>          <i>some rapture”</i>      (“Sultana contra Gentiles,” I. iii. cap. xlvii.,    Rickaby’s translation).</p>
