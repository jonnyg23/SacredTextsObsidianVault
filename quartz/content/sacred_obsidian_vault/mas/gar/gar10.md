 <p>BY the regulations of the Fraternity, a candidate for the mysteries of Masonry cannot be initiated in any regular Lodge, without having stood proposed one regular meeting, unless a dispensation be obtained in his favor. All applications for initiation should be made in writing, at a regular meeting of the Lodge, giving name, residence, age, occupation, and references, in the following form:</p>  
 <p><a name="page_20"><font size="1" color="green">p. 20</font></a></p>

If, at the next regular meeting of the Lodge, the report of the committee be favorable, the necessary preparations are made for his admission.</p>
