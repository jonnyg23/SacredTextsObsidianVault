 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="373">373</a></font></span>"I sent a man to Khatavet’hi and a letter from me; I wrote: 'The king of the Indians is of a truth powerful from God; every hungry soul of those faithful to him is</p>  
 <p><a name="page_61"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 61</font></a></p>  
 <p>sated; whosoever is disobedient will have himself to blame (for any ill that may befall him).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="374">374</a></font></span>"'Brother and lord, by you we will not be embittered. When you see this command wend hither; if you come not we shall come; we will not steal upon you. It is better you should come to us, spill not your own blood.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="375">375</a></font></span>"I sent the man, I gave my heart up yet more to rejoicing, I made merry at court; the fire unbearable in its burning was extinguished. Then the world, Fate, gave me lavishly what I desired; now I am mad, so that I annoy even the wild beats if I approach them.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="376">376</a></font></span>"At first the plan of roaming, then reason soothed me. I feasted with my comrades, but the greatness of desires hindered me from joy; sometimes they filled me with melancholy, I uttered curses against Fate.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="377">377</a></font></span>"One day, on my return from the king's palace, I came to my chamber. I sat down and thought of her, slumber fell not upon mine eyes, I had the letter of hope, therefore was I merry. The doorkeeper called the slave; he said it was a secret matter.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="378">378</a></font></span>"'It is Asmat’h's slave,' quoth he. I ordered him to be brought into the chamber. She wrote to me that she whose knife had pierced my heart commanded me to come. Joy lightened my darkness; she loosened my chains. I went, I took the slave, I spoke not at all with him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="379">379</a></font></span>"I entered the garden; I met none to speak to me (?). The maid met me merry, smiling; she said: 'I have bravely extracted the thorn from thy heart, it is no longer therein; come and see thy rose unfaded, unwithered.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="380">380</a></font></span>"The maid with an effort raised the heavy curtain,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_62"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 62</font></a></p>  
 <p>there stood a canopy adorned with choice rubies where sat she whose face was like the sun flashing, her eyes, like inky lakes, looked beautifully at me.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="381">381</a></font></span>"A long time I stood, and she spoke no word to me whom she yearned for; she only looked at me sweetly as at an intimate. She called Asmat’h, they spoke together; the maid came and whispered in my ear: 'Now go; she cannot say anything to thee.' Again the flame reduced me to soot.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="382">382</a></font></span>"Asmat’h led me forth, I went out, I passed the curtain. I said: 'O Fate, who not long ago didst heal my heart, thou gayest me hope then; why hast thou scattered my joy? My heart is still more devastated again by the pain of parting.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="383">383</a></font></span>"Asmat’h promised me comfort. We walked through the garden; she said to me: 'Let not the brand be thus seen upon thy heart because of thy going; shut the terrace of sorrows, open the door of joy. She is ashamed to speak; therefore she behaves with dignity.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="384">384</a></font></span>"I said: 'O sister, I think this heart-balm is from thee. I adjure thee, part me not from life, extinguish this flame with tidings, cut me not off from letters, send them ceaselessly; if thou learnest something for me I think thou wilt not keep it hidden from me.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="385">385</a></font></span>"I mounted (my horse), I went thence, a stream flowed from the channel of tears. I went to bed; maddened, I had no power to sleep. I, the crystal and ruby, became bluest indigo. I preferred night; I wished not for the dawn of day.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="386">386</a></font></span>"Denizens of Khatavet’hi came--it was time for them to come--they brought a proud and insolent message: 'We are no cowards, neither are our keeps unfortified. Who is your monarch? What lord is he over me?'</p>
