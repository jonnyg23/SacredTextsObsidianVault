   <h3 align="center">XXIX</h3>  <h3 align="center">THE STORY OF AVT’HANDIL'S ARRIVAL IN GULANSHARO</h3>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1039">1039</a></font></span>Avt’handil crossed the sea; with stately form went he. They saw a city engirt by a thicket of garden, with wondrous kinds of flowers of many and many a hue. In</p>  
 <p><a name="page_168"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 168</font></a></p>  
 <p>what way canst thou understand the loveliness of that land!</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1040">1040</a></font></span>With three ropes they moored the ship to the shore of those gardens. Avt’handil clad his form in a cloak and sat on a bench. They brought out men that were porters, provided with drachmas. That knight bargains, acts as chief (of the caravan), and thereby conceals himself.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1041">1041</a></font></span>Thither came the gardener of him at whose garden they had landed; with ecstasy he gazes at the knight's face flashing like lightning. Avt’handil hailed him, he spoke to the man with faultless words: "Whose men are ye, who are ye? how call they the king reigning here?</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1042">1042</a></font></span>"Tell me all in detail," quoth the knight to that man; "what stuff is dearer, or what is bought up cheap?" He said: "I see, thy face seems to me like the face of the sun. Whatever I know I will tell thee truly; I will by no means inform thee crookedly.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1043">1043</a></font></span>"The Sea Realm is this, ten months’ (travel) in extent, this is the city of Gulansharo <a name="fr_28"></a><a href="#fn_28"><font size="1">1</font></a>, full of much loveliness. Hither everything fair cometh by ships sailing from sea to sea. Melik Surkhavi rules, perfect in good fortune and wealth.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1044">1044</a></font></span>"Even if he be old, a man is rejuvenated by coming hither; drinking, rejoicing, tilting and songs are unceasing; summer and winter alike we have many-hued flowers; whoever knoweth us envieth us, even they who are our foes.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1045">1045</a></font></span>"Great merchants can find nought more profitable than this: They buy, they sell, they gain, they lose; a poor man will be enriched in a month; from all quarters they gather merchandise; the penniless by the end of the year have money laid by.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1046">1046</a></font></span>"I am gardener to Usen, chief of the merchants. I shall tell thee somewhat of the manner of his ordinance:</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_169"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 169</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> This is his garden, your resting-place for the day; first it is necessary to show him all the fairest of your goods.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1047">1047</a></font></span>"When great merchants arrive they see him and give him gifts, they show him what they have, elsewhere they cannot unpack their goods; for the king they set aside the best, they straightway count out the price; thereupon he frees them to sell as they please.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1048">1048</a></font></span>"His duty it is to receive such honourable folk as you, he orders the caterers how to entertain them fitly; he is not now here, what avails it me to speak of him To meet you and carry you away with him, pressing you politely, is the way he should treat you.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1049">1049</a></font></span>"P’hatman Khat’hun, the lady, his wife, is at home, a hospitable hostess, amiable, not rough. I shall inform her of your arrival, she will take you in as one of her own folk, she will send a man to meet you, you shall enter the city by daylight."</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1050">1050</a></font></span>Avt’handil said: "Go, do whatever thou desirest." The gardener runs, he rejoices, sweat pours down to his breast. He tells his tidings to the lady: "I boast of this: a youth comes, to them that look on him his rays seem like the sun.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1051">1051</a></font></span>"He is some merchant, chief of a great caravan, well-grown like a cypress, a moon of seven days, his coat and the fold of his coral-hued turban become him; he called me, asked me tidings and the tariff for the purchase of goods."</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1052">1052</a></font></span>Dame P’hatman rejoiced; she sent ten slaves to meet him; they prepared the caravanserais, she stored their wares. The rose-cheeked, crystal and ruby, glass, jet, entered; they who looked on him compared his feet to the panther's, his palms to the lion's (paws).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1053">1053</a></font></span>There was a hubbub, the hosts of the town all</p>  
 <p><a name="page_170"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 170</font></a></p>  
 <p>assembled; they pressed on this side and on that, saying: "We will gaze on him till sleeptime." Some were carried away by desire, some had their souls reft from them; their wives grew weary of them, their husbands were left contemned.</p>
