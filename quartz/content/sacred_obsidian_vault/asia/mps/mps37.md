   <h3 align="center">XXXIV</h3>  <h3 align="center">HERE IS THE SLAYING OF THE CHACHNAGIR AND HIS TWO GUARDS BY AVT’HANDIL</h3>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1093">1093</a></font></span>That youth lay alone in his chamber with angry heart. Bloody-handed Avt’handil, strong in stature, entered, he gave him no time to rise, privily he slew him, we could not have perceived it; he laid hold of him, struck him on the ground, slew him with a knife.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1094">1094</a></font></span>He is a sun to them that gaze on him, a wild beast and a terror to those that oppose him. He cut off the finger with the ring, he hurled him down to the ground; he threw him from the window towards the sea, he was mingled with the sands of the sea; for him nowhere is there a tomb, nor spade to dig his grave.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1095">1095</a></font></span>Not a sound of their slaughter was heard. The sweet rose came forth; whereby could he have been so</p>  
 <p><a name="page_178"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 178</font></a></p>  
 <p>embittered? This is a marvel to me, how he could thus steal his blood! As he had lately come, by the same road went he away.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1096">1096</a></font></span>When the lion, the sun, the sweetly-speaking knight, came into P’hatman's (house), he announced: "I have slain him; no more will that youth see sunny day; thy slave himself I have as witness; make him swear an oath in God's name (that I did the deed); behold the finger and the ring, and I have my knife bloodied.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1097">1097</a></font></span>"Now tell me of what thou spakest, why thou wert so furiously enraged. With what did that man threaten thee? I am in great haste (to know it)." P’hatman embraced his legs: "I am not worthy to look on thy face; my wounded heart is healed; now am I ready to extinguish my fires.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1098">1098</a></font></span>"I and Usen with our children are now born anew. O lion, how can we magnify thy praises! Since we may boast that his blood is spilt, I will tell thee all from the beginning; prepare to listen.</p>
