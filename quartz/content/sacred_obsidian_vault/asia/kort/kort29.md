 <p><a name="fn_56"></a><a href="kort29.htm#fr_56">103:1</a> These two songs were written down from the phonographic records of Mr. Jochelson (No. 2 and No. 7 on his list). The first is in Koryak of Kamenskoye', the second is Chukchee in grammar and phonetics, and Koryak in vocabulary. It was obtained from an old Reindeer Chukchee of Parapolski Dol, who had lived for a long time among the Reindeer Koryak.</p>
