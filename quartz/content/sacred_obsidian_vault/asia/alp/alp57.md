 <p></p><dir>THE Sky bent down his piercing gaze one day<br> On Mother Earth, that far beneath him lay.<br> And as he looked on mountain, sea, and grove,<br> On hill and dale, he burnt with thoughts of love.  
 <p>Earth lying numbed and frozen ’neath the snow,<br> Sudden awoke to springtime's ardent glow,<br> And flames of fire her beating heart consumed,<br> While myriad flowers the air around perfumed.</p>  
 <p>And thus they loved, though never side by side,<br> Though Nature willed they should be parted wide--<br>      The Earth and Sky.</p>  
 <p>But when has love accepted with content<br> An obstacle When o’er the earth steals night,<br> The starry Sky, his vision downward bent,<br> Opens his thousand eyes of shining light,<br> And gazes on his love in worship still,<br> Gazes till dawn, and cannot take his fill.</p>  
 <p>And as he gazes, all his starry eyes<br> Are strewn into Earth's breast of waters blue,<br> Which foam, and heave, and swell, and strive to rise,<br> Longing to reach and join her lover true.</p>  
 <p>He, more and more inflamed by passion's fire,<br> In all the splendours of the night arrayed,<br> Pours in her ear his longing and desire,<br> And shows her all his pomp and pride displayed;<br>      Towards her turning<br>      And ever yearning.</p></dir>

 <p></p><dir>But when he finds his love is out of reach<br> He turns away, nor utters sound nor speech;<br> And in the dark the tears that dim his sight<br> Fall on earth's cheeks in showers of dewdrops bright,--<br> Dewdrops of pearl--the tears that heaven weeps,<br> And then Earth's bosom swells. Her thousand deeps,<br> Her boundless oceans, rise once more to meet<br> The far-off loved one; and her mountain peaks<br> Like myriad lips rise up the clouds to greet,--<br> To kiss their gloomy forms, and sullen cheeks.  
 <p>And love torments her with its ceaseless fire.<br> Her waters foam, and writhe, and are convulsed,<br> Yet never may they reach their heart's desire,--<br> Restlessly sobbing, ever more repulsed.</p>  
 <p>    And from her gloomy throne,<br>     Behind the clouds, alone,<br> The moon beheld it with her sleepless eye.<br> And told the Poet how she did espy<br> That in the darkness of the silent night<br> Earth heaved her bosom up to Heaven above;<br> And that the sky smiled on her with delight,<br> As they exchanged the secret kiss of love;<br> And for each other sweetest songs they sing<br> And they embrace each other and caress,<br> Like living souls, each other gladdening.</p>  
 <p>Then on the Poet fell a deep distress,<br> A jealous sorrow--for he fain would, too,<br> Possess a love as noble and as true.</p></dir>
