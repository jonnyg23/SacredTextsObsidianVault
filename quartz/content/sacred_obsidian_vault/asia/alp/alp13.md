 <p></p><dir>     YESTERNIGHT I walked abroad.<br> From the clouds sweet dews were falling,<br>      And my love stood in the road,<br> All in green, and to me calling.<br>      To her home she led me straight,<br> Shut and barred the gate securely;<br>      Whoso tries to force that gate<br> Brave I'll reckon him most surely!  
 <p>     In the garden she did go,<br> Gathered roses dewed with showers;<br>      Some she gave her lover, so<br> He might lay his face in flowers.</p>  
 <p>     Garments loose and snowy breast,<br> I slipped in her bosom tender<br>      And I found a moment's rest,<br> Clasped within those arms so slender.<br>      Then I raised my hands above--<br> Grant, O Lord, that I wake never;<br>      On the bosom of my love<br> May I live and die forever!</p>  
 <p>     What have I from this world gained?<br> What advantage gathered ever?<br>      For the hunt my falcon trained<br> I let fly--it went forever!</p></dir>  
 <p><a name="page_8"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 8</font></a></p>  
 <p></p><dir>     Ah, my falcon, woe the day!<br> Tell me, whither art thou flying<br>      I will follow all the way--<br> Since thou wentest I am dying.  
 <p>     I am ill, and near my end--<br> With an apple <a name="fr_1"></a><a href="#fn_1"><font size="1">1</font></a> hasten to me.<br>      I shall curse thee if thou send<br> Strange physicians to undo me.</p>  
 <p>     No physicians strange for me--<br> All my griefs in thee I centre.<br>      Come and take my bosom's key,<br> Open wide the door and enter.<br>      Once again I say, ’twas not<br> I that came--’twas thy love brought me.<br>      In my heart thy love hath got<br> And its dwelling-place hath wrought me.</p>  
 <p>     When the falcon hunger feels<br> Then he finds the game and takes it;<br>      When love thirsts, the lover steals<br> Kisses from his love and slakes it.<br>      But thou hold'st me with thy charms;<br> When I kiss thee thou dost bind me:<br>      ’Twas but now I left thine arms,<br> And my looks are turned behind me.<br>      I am ever, for thy love,<br> Like the sands in summer, burning:<br>      Looking up to heaven above,<br> For one little raindrop yearning.</p></dir>

 <p></p><dir>     I would kiss thy forehead chaste,<br> And thine eyes so brightly gleaming;<br>      Fold mine arms about thy waist--<br> Thick with all thy garments seeming.  
 <p>     Oft and often have I said<br> For my love make garments shining:<br>      Of the sun the facing red,--<br> Of the moon cut out the lining;<br>      Pad it with yon storm-cloud dark,<br> Sewn with sea weed from the islets:<br>      Stars for clasps must bring their spark--<br> Stitch me inside for the eyelets!</p></dir>
