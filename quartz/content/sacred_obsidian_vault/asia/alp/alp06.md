 <p align="center">(<i>Died</i> 1330)</p>  
 <p></p><dir>O GOD of righteousness and truth,<br> Loving to all, and full of ruth;<br> I have some matter for Thine ear<br> If Thou wilt but Thy servant hear.  
 <p>Lo, how the world afflicteth us<br> With wrongs and torments rancorous;<br> And Thou dost pardon every one,<br> But turnest from our woes alone.</p>  
 <p>Lord, Thou wilt not avenge our wrong<br> Nor chase the ills that round us throng;<br> Thou knowest, we are flesh and bone,<br> We are not statues made from stone!</p>  
 <p>We are not made of grass or reeds,<br> That Thou consumest us like weeds;--<br> As though we were some thorny field<br> Or brushwood, that the forests yield.</p>  
 <p>If that ourselves are nothing worth--<br> If we have wrought no good on earth,<br> If we are hateful in Thy sight<br> That Thou shouldst leave us in this plight--</p>  
 <p>Then blot us out;--be swift and brief,<br> That Thy pure heart may find relief;<br> This well may be, by Thy intent,<br> Great Lord and good, omnipotent.</p>  
 <p>How long must we in patience wait<br> And bear unmurmuringly our fate?<br> Let evil ones be swept away<br> And those whom Thou dost favour, stay!</p></dir>
