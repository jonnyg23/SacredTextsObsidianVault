 <p align="center">(1820--1901)</p>  
 <p></p><dir>ARMENIAN maidens, come and view<br> In Shavarshan a lily new!  
 <p>The radiant type of maidenhood,<br>     Crown of Armenia's pride!<br> From the fair brow beneath her veil<br>     The wind-stirred curls float wide<br> With little steps, like turtle dove,<br>     She walks the dew-bright plain;<br> Her lips drop honey, and her eyes<br>     Effulgent glances rain.</p>  
 <p>The beauty of Armenia,<br>     A sun-like mirror clear,<br> Our Northern star is bright Santoukhd,<br>     The king's fair daughter dear.<br> She has come forth, the graceful bride<br>     On whom the East and West<br> Desire to look, while fires of love<br>     Consume the gazer's breast.</p>  
 <p>Less fair the bright and morning star,<br>     ’Mid cloudlets small and fine;<br> Less fair the fruit whose rosy tints<br>     ’Mid apple leaves outshine;<br> Araxes' hyacinthine flower<br>     That chains of dew doth wear,<br> All are less beautiful than she,<br>     With gracious mien and air.</p></dir>  
 <p><a name="page_38"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 38</font></a></p>  
 <p></p><dir>At sight of her, the snowy peaks<br>      Melt and are flushed with rose;<br> Trees, flowers bud forth; the nightingales<br>      All sing where’er she goes.<br> The bell-flowers open myriad eyes<br>      When she comes through the bowers;<br> Beneath her breath, the vales and hills<br>      Alike are clad in flowers.  
 <p>Before her have been bent to earth<br>      Foreheads with diadems;<br> The valley has become a hill<br>      Of scattered gold and gems.<br> Where passes by with humble grace<br>      Armenia's virgin sweet,<br> Fine sands of pearls come longingly<br>      To spread beneath her feet.</p>  
 <p>Full many a monarch's valiant son<br>      Has left his palace home<br> In Persia or Albania,<br>      In India or in Rome.<br> Admiringly they gaze on her,<br>      Exclaiming, "Happy he<br> Who wins the fair Armenian maid<br>      His bride beloved to be!"</p>  
 <p>But palace worthy of Santoukhd<br>      The earth can nowhere show,<br> And for the arches of her brows<br>      This world is all too low.</p></dir>  
 <p><a name="page_39"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 39</font></a></p>  
 <p></p><dir>The Sky says, "Let her on my throne<br>      Reign queen o’er every land."<br> The Ocean says, "My purple waves<br>      Shall bow to her command."  
 <p>There is One greater than the earth,<br>      More wide than sea-waves run,<br> Higher and vaster than the heavens,<br>      And brighter than the sun.<br> There is a formidable King<br>      Whose power no bound has known;<br> The royal maid Santoukhd shall be<br>      For Him, and Him alone.<br> Her halls of light are all prepared,<br>      And for a footstool meet<br> The azure sky adorned with stars<br>      Awaits her dove-like feet.</p>  
 <p>   .       .       .       .       .       .</p>  
 <p>The sharp sword glitters in the air,<br>      And swift the red blood flows;<br> Santoukhd, who was a lily fair,<br>      Falls to the earth, a rose.<br> The sword flashed once, and aspects three<br>      Were in Santoukhd descried;<br> Her heart dropped blood, and roses red<br>      Sprang up on every side;<br> Her eyes were violet chalices,<br> Sweet e’en while they expire;<br>      Her face, like lilies half unclosed,<br> But on her lips what fire!</p>  
 <p>The heaven and earth shine white and red;<br>      Come forth and gather, maids,</p></dir>  
 <p><a name="page_40"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 40</font></a></p>  
 <p></p><dir>The rose and lily joined in one,<br>      This peerless flower that fades!<br> Lay in the tomb that youthful corpse,<br>      With Thaddeus, good and brave.<br> Sweet maiden of Armenia,<br>      Her sweet soil be thy grave!<br> Armenian maids, a lily new<br> Is brought to Shavarshan for you!
