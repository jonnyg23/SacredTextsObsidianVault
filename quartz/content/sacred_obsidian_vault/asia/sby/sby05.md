 <p>Before all creation this revelation was with Melek Ṭâûs, who sent Abd Ṭâûs to this world that he might separate truth known to his particular people.</p>  
 <p>This was done, first of all, by means of oral tradition, and afterward by means of this book, Al-Jilwah, which the outsiders may neither read nor behold.</p>
