 Bar-Hebraeus was a 13th century bishop of the Syriac Orthodox Church.
 Born in 1226 in what is now Turkey, Bar-Hebraeus was renowned as a scholar
 and theologian.
 He died in 1286 in Persia.
 Writing mostly in Syriac and Arabic, Bar Hebraeus wrote on philosophy, poetry,
 language, history and theology, including a comprehensive history of the
 world, the <cite>Chronicon Ecclesiasticum</cite>.
 </p>
 <p>
 The Laughable Stories are a sequence of anecdotes categorized by
 the story-teller: starting with Persian, Indian, Hebrew and Christian sages,
 and including stories of Misers, Clowns, Thieves, and Animals and so on.
 Many of these stories have been included in compilations much
 further away in time and space.
 While a streak of sexism runs through the collection, in a couple of
 instances, the shoe is on the other foot.
 While many of these tales were probably pretty funny in the original
 13th century cultural context, some of them will be totally mysterious
 to moderns.

 Production notes: The translation, by E.A.W. Budge, who also did
 many of the Ancient Egyptian texts at this site, used a 19th century
 form of quotation in which quotes are inserted at the start of each line
 in multi-line quoted blocks; this has been modernized.
 This made the transcription difficult, since in some cases I had to
 make editorial decisions as to the location of the modern quotes.
