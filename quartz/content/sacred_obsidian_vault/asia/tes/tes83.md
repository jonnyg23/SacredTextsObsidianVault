 <h3 align="CENTER">18. STORY OF THE FOX AND THE WOLF. <a name="fr_124"></a><a href="#fn_124"><font size="1">1</font></a></h3>
 <p>The man pursued Fox with dogs, but Fox succeeded in plunging into the nest of a polar Owl. <a name="fr_125"></a><a href="#fn_125"><font size="1">2</font></a> The man chopped at the trunk with his heavy ax. "O gossip! I want to fly out."--"Ah, gossip! do as if you have too; but before doing so please pass water upon my neck," said the Fox. Owl passed water upon Fox's neck. When the man caught Fox by the neck, she slipped out of his fingers and ran off. The dogs followed her. She ran to and fro, until she was tired. Then she called to Owl, "O gossip! teach me how to fly."--"All right! Sit down on my back!" The owl alighted and carried off Fox. They flew up high into the air. "Oh dear!" said Fox. "I know how to fly, but I do not know how to alight." Owl pretended to throw her down. "O Lord! let it be upon the moss! O God! let it be upon a soft place!" Owl threw her down and Fox was killed.</p>
 <p>Told by Mary Alin, a Russianized Chuvantzi woman. Recorded by Mrs. Sophie Bogoras in the village of Markova, the Anadyr country, winter of 1900.</p>
