 <p>In the northernmost part of the Mediterranean there lies an island close to the coast. They now came and asked to buy that, on which a general council was held.</p>  
 <p>The mother's advice was asked, and she wished to see them at some distance, so she saw no harm in it; but as we afterwards saw what a mistake we had made, we called the island Missellia <a name="fr_29"></a><a href="#fn_29"><font size="1">‡</font></a> (Marseilles). Hereafter will be seen what reason we had. The Golen <a name="fr_30"></a><a href="#fn_30"><font size="1">§</font></a>, as the missionary priests of Sidon were called, had observed that the land there was thinly peopled, and was far from the mother. In order to make a favourable impression, they had themselves called in our language <i>followers of the truth;</i> but they had better have been called <i>abstainers from the truth</i>, or, in short, "Triuwenden," as our seafaring people afterwards called them.

If any of our people had so conducted himself that his life was in danger, the Golen afforded him a refuge, and sent him to Phonisia, that is, Palmland. When he was settled there, they made him write to his family, friends, and connections that the country was so good and the people so happy that no one could form any idea of it. In Britain there were plenty of men, but few women. When the Golen knew this, they carried off girls everywhere and gave them to the Britons for nothing. So all these girls served their purpose to steal children from Wr-alda in order to give them to false gods.</p>
