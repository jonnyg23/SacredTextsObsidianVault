 <h3 align="CENTER">Origin of the Pithecoid and the Anthropoid Apes.</h3>
 <p>The anatomical resemblance between Man and the higher Ape, so frequently cited by Darwinists as pointing to some ancestor common to both, presents an interesting problem, the proper solution of which is to be sought for in the esoteric explanation of the genesis of the pithecoid stocks.</p>
 <p><a name="page_30"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 30</font></a></p>
 <p>Now, we gather from the Secret Doctrine <a name="fr_17"></a><a href="#fn_17"><font size="1">1</font></a> that the descendants of these semi-human monsters described above as originating in the sin of the "mindless," having through long centuries dwindled in size and become more densely physical, culminated in a race of Apes at the time of the Miocene period, from which in their turn are descended the pithecoids of to-day. With these Apes of the Miocene period, however, the Atlanteans of that age renewed the sin of the "mindless"--this time with full responsibility, and the resultants of their crime are the species of Apes now known as Anthropoid.</p>
 <p>We are given to understand that in the coming Sixth Root Race, these anthropoids will obtain human incarnation, in the bodies doubtless of the lowest races then existing upon earth.</p>
 <p>That part of the Lemurian continent where the separation of the sexes took place, and where both the fourth and the fifth sub-races flourished, is to be found in the earlier of the two maps. It lay to the east of the mountainous region of which the present Island of Madagascar formed a part, and thus occupied a central position around the smaller of the two great lakes.</p>
