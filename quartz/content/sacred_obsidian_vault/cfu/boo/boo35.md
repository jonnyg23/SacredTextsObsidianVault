 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">In</span> the city of Haou he built his hall,<br> With circling waters round the wall:<br> From north to south, from east to west<br> There was never a tongue but called him blest.<br> Great King Wu was a monarch true.</p>  
 <p>With divination deep, I trow,<br> Afar he sought the sight of Haou.<br> With tortoise-shell the site he chose,<br> And tier by tier the city rose.<br> Great King Wu was a monarch true.</p>  
 <p>By the waters of Fung white millet grew.<br> Statesmen wise were the choice of Wu,<br> The future reaped whate’er he planned;<br> His son was lord of a grateful land.<br> Good King Wu was a monarch true.</p>
