 <p>    <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Below</span> the hall<br> The pine-trees grow in front of the steps,<br> Irregularly scattered,—not in ordered lines.<br>     Some are tall and some are low:<br> The tallest of them is six roods high;<br>     The lowest but ten feet.<br>     They are like wild things<br>     And no one knows who planted them.<br> They touch the walls of my blue-tiled house;<br> Their roots are sunk in the terrace of white sand.<br> Morning and evening they are visited by the wind and moon;<br> Rain or fine,—they are free from dust and mud.<br> In the gales of autumn they whisper a vague tune;<br> From the suns of summer they yield a cool shade.<br> At the height of spring the fine evening, rain<br> Fills their leaves with a load of hanging pearls.<br> At the year's end the time of great snow<br> Stamps their branches with a fret of glittering jade.<br> Of the Four Seasons each has its own mood;<br> Among all the trees none is like another.<br> Last year, when they heard I had bought this house,<br> Neighbours mocked and the World called me mad—<br> That a whole family of twice ten souls<br> Should move house for the sake of a few pines!<br> Now that I have come to them, what have they given me?</p>  
 <p><a name="page_75"><font size="1" color="green">p. 75</font></a></p>  
 <p>They have only loosened the buckles of my care.<br> Yet even so, they are "profitable friends," <a name="fr_29"></a><a href="#fn_27"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> And fill my need of "converse with wise men."<br> Yet when I consider how, still a man of the world,<br> In belt and cap I scurry through dirt and dust,<br> From time to time my heart twinges with shame<br> That I am not fit to be master of my pines!</p>
