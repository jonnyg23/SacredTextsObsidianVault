 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">At</span> the rise of summer a hundred beasts and trees<br> Join in gladness that the Season bids them thrive.<br> Stags and does frolic in the deep woods;<br> Snakes and insects are pleased by the rank grass.<br> Wingèd birds love the thick leaves;<br> Scaly fish enjoy the fresh weeds.<br> But to one place Summer forgot to come;<br> I alone am left like a withered straw…<br>     Banished to the world's end;<br> Flesh and bone all in distant ways.<br> From my native-place no tidings come;<br> Rebel troops flood the land with war.<br> Sullen grief, in the end, what will it bring?<br> I am only wearing my own heart away.<br> Better far to let both body and mind<br> Blindly yield to the fate that Heaven made.<br> Hsûn-yang abounds in good wine;<br> I will fill my cup and never let it be dry.<br> On Pēn River fish are cheap as mud;<br> Early and late I will eat them, boiled and fried.<br> With morning rice at the temple under the hill,<br> And evening wine at the island in the lake…<br> Why should my thoughts turn to my native land?<br> For in this place one could well end one's age.</p>
