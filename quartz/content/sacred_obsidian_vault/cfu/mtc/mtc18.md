 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Unrewarded</span>, my will to serve the State;<br> At my closed door autumn grasses grow.<br> What could I do to ease a rustic heart?<br> I planted bamboos, more than a hundred shoots.<br> When I see their beauty, as they grow by the stream-side,<br> I feel again as though I lived in the hills,<br> And many a time on public holidays<br> Round their railing I walk till night comes.<br> Do not say that their roots are still weak,<br> Do not say that their shade is still small;<br> Already I feel that both in garden and house<br> Day by day a fresher air moves.<br> But most I love, lying near the window-side,<br> To hear in their branches the sound of the autumn-wind.</p>
