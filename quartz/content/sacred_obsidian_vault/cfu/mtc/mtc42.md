 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Men's</span> hearts love gold and jade;<br> Men's mouths covet wine and flesh.<br> Not so the old man of the stream;<br> He drinks from his gourd and asks nothing more.<br> South of the stream he cuts firewood and grass;<br> North of the stream he has built wall and roof.<br> Yearly he sows a single acre of land;<br> In spring he drives two yellow calves.<br> In these things he finds great repose;<br> Beyond these he has no wish or care.<br> By chance I met him walking by the water-side;<br> He took me home and lodged me in his thatched hut.<br> When I parted from him, to seek market and Court,<br> This old man asked my rank and pay.<br> Doubting my tale, he laughed loud and long:<br> "Privy Councillors do not sleep in barns."</p>
