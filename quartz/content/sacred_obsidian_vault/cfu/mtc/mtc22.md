 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">In</span> Hsü-chou, in the District of Ku-fēng<br> There lies a village whose name is Chu-ch‘ēn—<br> A hundred miles away from the county-town,<br> Amid fields of hemp and green of mulberry-trees.<br> Click, click goes the sound of the spinning-wheel;<br> Mules and oxen pack the village-streets.<br> The girls go drawing the water from the brook;<br> The men go gathering fire-wood on the hill.<br> So far from the town Government affairs are few;<br> So deep in the hills, man's ways are simple.<br> Though they have wealth, they do not traffic with it;<br> Though they reach the age, they do not enter the Army.<br> Each family keeps to its village trade;<br> Grey-headed, they have never left the gates.</p>  
 <p>Alive, they are the people of Ch‘ēn Village;<br> Dead, they become the dust of Ch‘ēn Village.<br> Out in the fields old men and young<br> Gaze gladly, each in the other's face.<br> In the whole village there are only two clans;<br> Age after age Chus have married Ch‘ēns.<br> Near or distant, they have kinsmen in every house;<br> Young or old, they have friends wherever they go.<br> On white wine and roasted fowl they fare<br> At joyful meetings more than "once a week."</p>  
 <p><a name="page_48"><font size="1" color="green">p. 48</font></a></p>  
 <p>While they are alive, they have no distant partings;<br> To choose a wife they go to a neighbour's house.<br> When they are dead,—no distant burial;<br> Round the village graves lie thick.<br> They are not troubled either about life or death;<br> They have no anguish either of body or soul.<br> And so it happens that they live to a ripe age<br> And great-great-grandsons are often seen.</p>  
 <p><i>I</i> was born in the Realms of Etiquette;<br> In early years, unprotected and poor.<br> Alone, I learnt to distinguish between Evil and Good;<br> Untutored, I toiled at bitter tasks.<br> The World's Law honours Learning and Fame;<br> Scholars prize marriages and Caps.<br> With these fetters I gyved my own hands;<br> Truly I became a much-deceived man.<br> At ten years old I learnt to read books;<br> At fifteen, I knew how to write prose.<br> At twenty I was made a Bachelor of Arts;<br> At thirty I became a Censor at the Court.<br> Above, the duty I owe to Prince and parents;<br> Below, the ties that bind me to wife and child.<br> The support of my family, the service of my country—<br> For these tasks my nature is not apt.<br> I reckon the time that I first left my home;<br> From then till now,—fifteen Springs!</p>

 <p>My lonely boat has thrice sailed to Ch‘u;<br> Four times through Ch‘in my lean horse has passed.<br> I have walked in the morning with hunger in my face;<br> I have lain at night with a soul that could not rest.<br> East and West I have wandered without pause,<br> Hither and thither like a cloud astray in the sky.<br> In the civil-war my old home was destroyed;<br> Of my flesh and blood many are scattered and lost.<br> North of the River, and South of the River—<br> In both lands are the friends of all my life;<br> Life-friends whom I never see at all,<br> Whose deaths I hear of only after the lapse of years.<br> Sad at morning, I lie on my bed till dusk;<br> Weeping at night, I sit and wait for dawn.<br> The fire of sorrow has burnt my heart's core;<br> The frost of trouble has seized my hair's roots.<br> In such anguish has my whole life passed;<br> Long I have envied the people of Ch‘ēn Village.</p>
