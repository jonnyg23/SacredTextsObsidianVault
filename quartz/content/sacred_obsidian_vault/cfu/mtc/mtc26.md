 <p><a name="fn_12"></a><a href="mtc26.htm#fr_14">53:1</a> Yen Hui told Confucius that he had acquired the "art of sitting and forgetting." Asked what that meant, Yen Hui replied, "I have learnt to discard my body and obliterate my intelligence; to abandon matter and be impervious to sense-perception. By this method I become one with the All-Pervading."—<i>Chuang Tzŭ,</i> chap. vi.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_13"></a><a href="mtc26.htm#fr_15">53:2</a> "Change" is the principle of endless mutation which governs the Universe.</p>
