 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The</span> World cheats those who cannot read;<br> <i>I,</i> happily, have mastered script and pen.<br> The World cheats those who hold no office;<br> <i>I</i> am blessed with high official rank.<br>     The old are often ill;<br> <i>I,</i> at this day have not an ache or pain.<br>     They are often burdened with ties;<br> But <i>I</i> have finished with marriage and giving in marriage.<br> No changes happen to disturb the quiet of my mind;<br> No business comes to impair the vigour of my limbs.<br> Hence it is that now for ten years<br> Body and soul have rested in hermit peace.<br> And all the more, in the last lingering years<br> What I shall need are very few things.<br> A single rug to warm me through the winter;<br> One meal to last me the whole day.<br> It does not matter that my house is rather small;<br> One cannot sleep in more than one room!<br> It does not matter that I have not many horses;<br> One cannot ride in two coaches at once!<br> As fortunate as me among the people of the world<br> Possibly one would find seven out of ten.<br> As contented as me among a hundred men<br> Look as you may, you will not find one.</p>

 <p>In the affairs of others even fools are wise;<br> In their own business even sages err.<br> To no one else would I dare to speak my heart,<br> So my wild words are addressed to my nephews and nieces.</p>
