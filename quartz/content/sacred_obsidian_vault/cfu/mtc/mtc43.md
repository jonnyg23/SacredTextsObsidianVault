 <p>    <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Can</span> the single cup of wine<br> We drank this morning have made my heart so glad?<br> This is a joy that comes only from within,<br> Which those who witness will never understand.<br>     I have but two brothers<br> And bitterly grieved that both were far away;<br> This Spring, back through the Gorges of Pa,<br> I have come to them safely, ten thousand leagues.<br>     Two sisters I had<br> Who had put up their hair, but not twined the sash; <a name="fr_28"></a><a href="#fn_26"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> Yesterday both were married and taken away<br> By good husbands in whom I may well trust.<br> I am freed at last from the thoughts that made me grieve,<br> As though a sword had cut a rope from my neck.<br> And limbs grow light when the heart sheds its care:<br> Suddenly I seem to be flying up to the sky!</p>  
 <p>Hsing-chien, drink your cup of wine<br> Then set it down and listen to what I say.<br> Do not sigh that your home is far away;<br> Do not mind if your salary is small.<br> Only pray that as long as life lasts,<br> You and I may never be forced to part.</p>
