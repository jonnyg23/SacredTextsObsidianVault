 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Within</span> the Gorges there is no lack of men;<br> They are people one meets, not people one cares for.<br> At my front door guests also arrive;<br> They are people one sits with, not people one knows.<br> When I look up, there are only clouds and trees;<br> When I look down—only my wife and child.<br> I sleep, eat, get up or sit still;<br> Apart from that, nothing happens at all.<br> But beyond the city Hsiao the hermit dwells;<br> And with <i>him</i> at least I find myself at ease.<br> For <i>he</i> can drink a full flagon of wine<br> And is good at reciting long-line poems.<br> Some afternoon, when the clerks have all gone home,<br> At a season when the path by the river bank is dry,<br> I beg you, take up your staff of bamboo-wood<br> And find your way to the parlour of the Government House.</p>
