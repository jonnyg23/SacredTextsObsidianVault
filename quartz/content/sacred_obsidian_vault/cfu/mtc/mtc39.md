 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The</span> province I govern is humble and remote;<br> Yet our festivals follow the Courtly Calendar.<br> At rise of day we sacrificed to the Wind God,<br> When darkly, darkly, dawn glimmered in the sky.<br> Officers followed, horsemen led the way;<br> They brought us out to the wastes beyond the town,<br> Where river mists fall heavier than rain,<br> And the fires on the hill leap higher than the stars.</p>  
 <p>Suddenly I remembered the early levees at Court <br> When you and I galloped to the Purple Yard.<br> As we walked our horses up Dragon Tail Street<br> We turned our heads and gazed at the Southern Hills.<br> Since we parted, both of us have been growing old;<br> And our minds have been vexed by many anxious cares.<br> Yet even now I fancy my ears are full<br> Of the sound of jade tinkling on your bridle-straps.</p>
