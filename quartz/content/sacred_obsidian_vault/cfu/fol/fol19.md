 <p>Once more Heaven bids the plough-star drive<br>       before the spring, and turn its handle to the east,<br> Spring—the blue harmonies of tumultuous waters!<br> The fair fragrance of orchid sprays.<br> Climb and look out and beyond. At once the eye<br>       retains the whole immeasurable expanse of<br>       the sea, and the slenderest film of the clouds.<br> The soul streams out in ecstasy.<br> Tears! my tears are falling.<br> Of the gentle pure breeze I sing—of the waves <br>       of Chang-lang are my songs<br> Of lake Duntkhin are my dreams, and my sighs<br>       for the river-lands of Oyas and Oyan.<br> What a lightness of health is in my soul! One<br>       with the spring-wafting of the wind, it soars<br>       away and flies I know not where. Yes! it <br>       soars, but whither I know not. And my <br>       thoughts are boundless.<br> I am whelmed in a dream of this fairest of seasons,<br>       in a mood that dispels not.<br> The whole plain heaves into bloom—what flowers!<br>       what sceneries!<br> Ah! fragrance of sweet herbs, my love and grief <br>       are for you.<br> Sorrow, a sharp-edged knife, is sheathed in my <br>       heart,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_49"><font size="1" color="green">p. 49</font></a></p>  
 <p>For these are the last of spring—the ending of<br>       spring's last days.<br> Sadness of heart takes hold of me, and no light<br>       weariness.</p>  
 <p>Away my thoughts! By the winding Khang, by<br>       the roaring rapids of Syan my plunging<br>       hands are hidden with fairy flowers—and<br>       still my thoughts have mastered me…</p>  
 <p>Each year this picture is the same. Spring comes<br>       —the flowers bloom. But lo, there is an<br>       end of them—and change comes over spring.</p>  
 <p>Swiftly, swiftly the long river speeds away its<br>       waters.<br> I follow with my gaze the flowing waves and in<br>       thought<br> I pass with them to the east, to the very sea.<br> Alas! ’tis even so with spring—it stays not with<br>       us once its time has come.<br> Soon, too soon will Destiny send forth the breath<br>       of tottering age.<br> Ah! that I cannot fling a long, long rope over the<br>       blue sky and bind with it the white orb of<br>       light as it rushes on to its setting!</p>
