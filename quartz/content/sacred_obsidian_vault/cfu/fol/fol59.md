 <p><small><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The</span> following two poems are anonymous, and belong to the Manchu period. They are but two of a series of flower studies endowing each flower with a fragrant personality of its own. The delicate beauty of the Chinese originals is almost impossible to reproduce.</small></p>  <h3 align="center">PLUM BLOSSOM</h3>  
 <p>One flower hath in itself the charms of two<br> Draw nearer and she breaks to wonders new.<br> An you might call her beauty of the rose,<br> She too is folded in a fleece of snows;<br> An you might call her pale, she doth betray<br> The blush of dawn beneath the eye of day.<br> The lips of her the wine-cup hath caressed,<br> The form of her that from some vision blest<br> Starts with the rose of sleep all glowing bright<br> Through limbs that ranged the dreamlands of the night.</p>  
 <p>The pencil falters and the song is naught, <br> Her beauty, like the sun, dispels my thought.</p>
