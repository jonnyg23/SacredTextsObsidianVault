 <p></p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Chên Lu;</i> allusive. Celebrating the representatives of the two former dynasties, who had come to court to assist at sacrifice:—may have been sung when the king was dismissing them in the ancestral temple.</div>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">Round yonder marsh, there in the west,<br>   A flock of egrets fly.<br> With graceful movement, like those birds,<br>   My visitors came nigh.<br> Their fathers reigned where I reign now,<br> But loyal are they to our Chou.  
 <p>There in their own states are they loved,<br>   Nor tired of are they here.<br> Their fame with lapse of time shall grow<br>   Both day and night more clear.<br> Their fathers reigned where I reign now,<br> But loyal are they to our Chou.</p></div>
