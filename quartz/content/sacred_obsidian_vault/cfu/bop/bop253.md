 <p></p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Wên Wang Yu Shêng;</i> narrative to the last stanza, which is allusive. The praise of King Wên and King Wu:—how the former displayed his military prowess only to secure the tranquillity of the people; how this appeared in the building of Fêng as his capital city; and how the latter entered, in his capital of Hao, into the sovereignty of the kingdom with the sincere good will of all the people.</div>
