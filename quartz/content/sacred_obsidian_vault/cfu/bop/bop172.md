 <p></p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Ti Tu;</i> narrative. An ode of congratulation, specially intended for the troops, on the return of the expedition against the Hsien-yün.</div>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2">2</a></font></span>The russet pear tree stands there all alone;<br> How dense the leafy shade all o’er it thrown!<br> The king's affairs require no slackening hand,<br> And our sad hearts their feelings can't command.<br> The plants and trees in beauty shine; ‘tis spring.<br> From off my heart its gloom I fain would fling.<br> This season well my warrior home may bring! <a name="page_202"><font size="1" color="green">p. 202</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_3">3</a></font></span>I climbed that northern hill, and medlars sought;<br> The spring nigh o’er, to ripeness they were brought.<br> "The king's affairs cannot be slackly done:"—<br> ’Tis thus our parents mourn their absent son.<br> But now his sandal car must broken be;<br> I seem his powerful steeds worn out to see.<br> Relief has gone! He can't be far from me!</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_4">4</a></font></span>Alas! they can't have marched; they don't arrive!<br> More hard it grows with my distress to strive.<br> The time is passed, and still he is not here!<br> My sorrows multiply; great is my fear.<br> But lo! by reeds and shell I have divined.<br> That he is near, they both assure my mind;—<br> Soon at my side my warrior I shall find!</p></div>
