 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2">2</a></font></span>Yes, Wu to follow them was given.<br>   To imitate his sires,<br> And to obey the will of Heaven,<br>   He ardently desires.<br> Through all his course this aim endured,<br> And this the people's trust secured. <a name="page_354"><font size="1" color="green">p. 354</font></a></p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_4">4</a></font></span>Thus the one man was Wu—the one,<br>   The king, whom all did love.<br> They saw in him the pattern son;<br>   Such sons to be they strove.<br> The filial aim in him bright shone;<br> In him were seen the dead and gone.</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_6">6</a></font></span>Ah! yes, Heaven's blessing will descend,<br>   And men their names shall bless.<br> Thousands from Chou's remotest end,<br>   Their praises shall express.<br> Their sway through myriad years shall last,<br> Nor helpers fail, strong friends and fast.</p></div>
