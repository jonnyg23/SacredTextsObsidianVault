 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2">2</a></font></span>To the hills of the east we went,<br>   And long had we there to remain.<br> When the word of recall was sent,<br>   Thick and fast came the drizzling rain.<br> The heavenly gourds rise to the eye,<br>   With their fruit hanging under the eave.<br> In our chambers the sowbug we spy;<br>   Their webs on our doors spiders weave.<br> Our paddocks seem crowded with deer,<br>   With the glowworm's light all about.<br> Such thoughts, while they filled us with fear,<br>   We tried, but in vain, to keep out.</p>
