And not less joy inspires<br> Those who yesterday played the part of your sires.<br> Your viands are fragrant; your spirits are clear.<br> They feast and they drink; and all happy appear.<br> Complete is the honor you render them here!  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2">2</a></font></span>The wild ducks and widgeons now see on the sand,<br> As along the King's banks they move or they stand!<br> How happy the birds! And now here, as their due,<br> Those who sat as your sires are feasted by you.<br> Abundant your spirits, your viands are good.<br> They feast and they drink in their happiest mood.<br> Ne’er before on the summit of honor they stood. <a name="page_368"><font size="1" color="green">p. 368</font></a></p>

And with joy those are filled,<br> Who with fathers long gone were yesterday thrilled.<br> Your viands are sliced, and your spirits are strained.<br> They feast and they drink, with new happiness gained<br> From this glory they now from you have obtained.</p>

And how honored are those,<br> In whom your sires yesterday found their repose!<br> The feast in the ancestral temple is spread,<br> Where blessing and dignity most are conveyed.<br> Of each feaster what happiness now crowns the head!</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_5">5</a></font></span>Where the stream through the rocks its way seems to forge,<br> Many wild ducks and widgeons rest in the gorge.<br> How happy the birds! As complacent are they, <a name="page_369"><font size="1" color="green">p. 369</font></a><br> Through whom your great fathers their will did convey.<br> Your exquisite spirits, your meat broiled and roast,<br> That they have partaken those feasters can boast.<br> Henceforth shall their minds by no troubles be tossed!</p></div>
