 <p></p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Tsai Shan</i>; narrative. The cultivation of the ground, from the first breaking of it up till it yields abundant harvests;—available specially for sacrifices and on festive occasions.</div>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">The toilers come to clear the ground,<br> Where grass and brushwood thick abound,<br> Where plowshare never yet was found. <a name="page_455"><font size="1" color="green">p. 455</font></a>  
 <p>In thousands now they gather there;<br> And side by side, and pair by pair,<br> The roots from out the soil they tear:—</p>  
 <p>Some in the marshes lying low;<br> Some where the dry paths winding go;<br> Some where the running waters flow.</p>  
 <p>The master see, inspecting all;<br> His sons, responsive to his call;<br> Their households also, great and small.</p>  
 <p>With them are neighbors, strong and true,<br> Who come all helpful work to do;<br> And servants hired are present too.</p>  
 <p>Hark! how the merry feast goes round!<br> The husbands’ hearts with love abound;<br> Their wives close by their sides are found.</p>  
 <p>Now they begin with patient care<br> The southern acres to prepare.<br> The soil is broken by the share.</p>  
 <p>They sow the various grains; each ear<br> With mystic life will soon appear,<br> When the young plants their heads uprear. <a name="page_456"><font size="1" color="green">p. 456</font></a></p>  
 <p>Behold in lines unbroken rise<br> The tender blades, whose lengthening size<br> Gains daily growth before our eyes!</p>  
 <p>Luxuriant is the sprouting grain,<br> And through it goes a numerous train.<br> Who weed it o’er and o’er again.</p>  
 <p>Erelong their work the reapers ply,<br> The golden grain is piled on high;<br> The stalks unnumbered multiply:—</p>  
 <p>Enough to make the spirits sweet,<br> To offer at our fathers’ feet;<br> To furnish what for rites is meet;</p>  
 <p>Enough, when at the fragrant board<br> Sit host and guest, for king and lord<br> The glorious banquet to afford;</p>  
 <p>Enough, when now the feast is o’er,<br> To satisfy the aged poor,<br> And cheer them from the unfailing store.</p>  
 <p>Nor now alone, but from of old,<br> And everywhere's the story told,<br> Toil reaps from earth a thousandfold.</p></div>
