 <p></p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Tang;</i> narrative. Warnings addressed to King Li on the issues of the course which he was pursuing, showing that the miseries of the time, and the imminent danger of ruin, were to be attributed, not to Heaven, but to himself and his ministers</div>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;"><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_1">1</a></font></span>How great is God, who ruleth men below!<br>   In awful terrors now arrayed,<br> His dealings seem a recklessness to show,<br>   From which we shuddering shrink, dismayed.<br> But men at first from Heaven their being drew,<br>   With nature liable to change.<br> All hearts in infancy are good and true,<br>   But time and things those hearts derange.  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2">2</a></font></span>Thus to the tyrant Ju our King Wên said:—<br>   "Alas! alas! O king of Yin,<br> To you the proud oppressors give their aid,<br>   And ’gainst you fierce exactors sin!<br> Why call such men your offices to hold?<br>   O’er your affairs why such men set? <a name="page_387"><font size="1" color="green">p. 387</font></a><br> ‘Heaven made them thus, so insolent and bold!’<br>   But ’tis from you their strength they get."</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_3">3</a></font></span>Thus to the tyrant Ju our King Wên said:—<br>     "Alas! alas! Yin's king so great,<br> You honor not the good, but in their stead<br>   Oppressors whom the people hate.<br> To you with baseless stories they reply,<br>   And thieves and robbers by them stand.<br> Their oaths and maledictions fiercely fly,<br>   Ceaseless and deep, throughout the land."</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_4">4</a></font></span>Thus to the tyrant Ju our King Wên said:—<br>   "Alas! alas! O king of Yin,<br> Fierce is your will, here in the court displayed,<br>   And only hatred thus you win.<br> Your proper virtue you have never sought,<br>   And thus none good surround your throne.<br> Of what true virtue is you take no thought,<br>   Hence are your nobles worthless known."</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_5">5</a></font></span>Thus to the tyrant Ju our King Wên said:—<br>   "Alas! alas! Yin's king so great, <a name="page_388"><font size="1" color="green">p. 388</font></a><br> Not Heaven, but spirits, flush your face with red,<br>   That evil thus you imitate.<br> You do in all your conduct what is wrong.<br>   Darkness to you the same as light,<br> Your noisy feasts and revels you prolong;<br>   And day through you is black as night."</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_6">6</a></font></span>Thus to the tyrant Ju our King Wên said:—<br>   "Alas! alas! O king of Yin,<br> Round you it is as if cicadas made,<br>   And bubbling soup, their ceaseless din.<br> Things, great and small, fast to perdition go,<br>   While you pursue your reckless game.<br> Our middle states with indignation glow;<br>   The demon lands as loudly blame."</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_7">7</a></font></span>Thus to the tyrant Ju our King Wên said:—<br>   "Alas! alas! O Yin's great king,<br> ’Tis Yin, not God, has caused this time of dread,<br>   Yin that old ways away would fling.<br> Old men and wise may not give you their trust,<br>   But statutes and old laws remain. <a name="page_389"><font size="1" color="green">p. 389</font></a><br> Now is Yin's fortune crumbling to the dust,<br>   Because obedience you disdain."</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_8">8</a></font></span>Thus to the tyrant Ju King Wên did speak:—<br>   "Alas! alas! O king of Yin,<br> For Yin its beacon was not far to seek;—<br>   In Hsia's last king its light was seen.<br> True is the lesson in the saying taught:<br>   'While leaf and branch still vigorous grow,<br> A tree may fall. And what that fall has wrought?<br>   Its roots uptorn the cause will show.'"</p></div>
