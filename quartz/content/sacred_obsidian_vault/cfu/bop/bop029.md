The Odes of P‘ei</span></h3>  <h4 align="center">I</h4>  
 <p></p><div style="font-size: 90%">The Pai Chou; mostly narrative. An officer of worth bewails the neglect and contempt with which he was treated.</div>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;"><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_1">1</a></font></span>It floats about, that boat of cypress wood,<br>   Now here, now there, as by the current borne.<br> Nor rest nor sleep comes in my troubled mood;<br>   I suffer as when painful wound has torn<br>   The shrinking body. Thus I dwell forlorn, <a name="page_24"><font size="1" color="green">p. 24</font></a><br>   And aimless muse, my thoughts of sorrow full.<br>     I might with wine refresh my spirit worn;<br>   I might go forth, and, sauntering try to cool<br> The fever of my heart; but grief holds sullen rule.  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2">2</a></font></span>My mind resembles not a mirror plate,<br>   Reflecting all th’ impressions it receives.<br> The good I love, the bad regard with hate;<br>   I only cherish whom my heart believes.<br>   Colleagues I have, but yet my spirit grieves,<br> That on their honor I cannot depend.<br>     I speak, but my complaint no influence leaves<br>   Upon their hearts; with mine no feelings blend;<br> With me in anger they, and fierce disdain contend.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_3">3</a></font></span>My mind is fixed, and cannot, like a stone,<br>   Be turned at will indifferently about;<br> And what I think, to that, and that alone,<br>   I utterance give, alike within, without;<br>   Nor can like mat be rolled and carried out.<br> With dignity, in presence of them all,<br>     My conduct marked, my goodness who shall scout?<br>   My foes I boldly challenge, great and small,<br> If there be aught in me they can in question call. <a name="page_25"><font size="1" color="green">p. 25</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_4">4</a></font></span>How full of trouble is my anxious heart!<br>   With hate the blatant herd of creatures mean<br> Ceaseless pursue. Of their attacks the smart<br>   Keeps my mind in distress. Their venomed spleen<br>   Aye vents itself; and with insulting mien<br> They vex my soul; and no one on my side<br>     A word will speak. Silent, alone, unseen,<br>   I think of my sad case; then opening wide<br> My eyes, as if from sleep, I beat my breast, sore-tried.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_5">5</a></font></span>Thy disk, O sun, should ever be complete,<br>   While thine, O changing moon, doth wax and wane.<br> But now our sun hath waned, weak and effete,<br>   And moons are ever full. My heart with pain<br>   Is firmly bound, and held in sorrow's chain,<br> As to the body cleaves an unwashed dress.<br>     Silent I think of my sad case; in vain<br>   I try to find relief from my distress.<br> Would I had wings to fly where ills no longer press!</p></div>
