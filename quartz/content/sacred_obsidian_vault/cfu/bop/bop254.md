 <p></p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Shêng Min;</i> narrative. The legend of Hou-chi:—his conception; his birth; the perils of his infancy; his boyish habits of agriculture; his subsequent teaching of agriculture, and his founding of sacrifices, the honors of sacrifice paid to him by the house of Chou.</div>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2">2</a></font></span>Lo! when her carrying time was done,<br> Came like a lamb this first-born son.<br> No pains of labor suffered she,—<br> No hurt, no strain, no injury.<br> With omen of his future part<br> Did God thus cheer the mother's heart.<br> He had accepted in the skies<br> Her offering and her sacrifice;—<br> And thus it was she bore her son,<br> And of birth pangs had suffered none.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_3">3</a></font></span>Once in a narrow lane exposed,<br> The sheep and oxen round him closed,<br> And sheltered with their loving care.<br> Again the woodman found him, where<br> In a wide forest he was placed,<br> And bore him from the darksome waste.<br> On the cold ice exposed once more,<br> A bird, beneath the child and o’er,<br> Stretched its great wings. When it took flight,<br> Hou-chi began to wail in fright;<br> And loud and long his cries resound,<br> Filling the airy region round. <a name="page_360"><font size="1" color="green">p. 360</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_4">4</a></font></span>When he could only creep, his face<br> With glance of wisdom beamed, and grace.<br> When he could feed himself, then fain<br> Was he to sow large beans and grain.<br> His beans with fine luxuriance grow;<br> His rows of rice rare beauty show;<br> His hemp and wheat adorn the field;<br> His gourds abundant produce yield.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_5">5</a></font></span>In husbandry this was his course:—<br> Wisely to aid kind nature's force.<br> He cleared the grass, and plowed the land,<br> Where yellow grain should waving stand.<br> The living germ with care was nurst,<br> Till from its sheath it nearly burst.<br> ’Twas then as seed laid in the ground:—<br> It sprang, and soon in ear was found.<br> Strong grew the plant, and fine, and sweet,<br> Hung down anon, each grain complete.—<br> T‘ai’s state to rule for him was meet. <a name="page_361"><font size="1" color="green">p. 361</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_6">6</a></font></span>There he gave out the beauteous grains:—<br> Millets,—the black, and what contains<br> Two kernels, and tall red, and white.<br> Largely they planted with delight<br> The double-kerneled, and the black,<br> Which, as they reap, they quickly stack.<br> The red and white their labor share,<br> But these, when reaped, they homeward bear,<br> And for the solemn rites prepare.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_7">7</a></font></span>And still those rites we here maintain.<br> Some in the mortar hull the grain;<br> Some take it thence; then sift it some;<br> The while fresh treaders constant come.<br> Washed in the dish with rattling sound,<br> It is distilled; the steam floats round.<br> We fix the day, and then with prayer<br> And fasting for the rites prepare.<br> Upon the burning fat we lay<br> The southernwood, and next essay,<br> With ram, the Spirit of the way<br> To please. Flesh boiled or roast<br> For representatives we boast.<br> We with these rites Hou-chi revere,<br> And welcome in the opening year. <a name="page_362"><font size="1" color="green">p. 362</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_8">8</a></font></span>The stands of wood and earthenware<br> Grand store of various offerings bear.<br> Soon as their fragrant odors rise,<br> God, pleased, accepts the sacrifice.<br> Fragrant it is, and timely paid;—<br> ’Twas Hou-chi its foundation laid.<br> Chou's lords and kings, down to this time,<br> Have duly kept the rite sublime.</p></div>
