 <p></p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Shih Jên;</i> narrative. Chuang Chiang as she appeared on her arrival in Wei. Her great connections; her beauty; her equipage; the riches of Ch‘i.</div>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2">2</a></font></span>  Like blades of white grass were her fingers fine;<br>     Her skin like purest ointment hard congealed;<br>   Her neck like larvæ on the tree which shine<br>     So long and white. Her opening lips revealed<br>     Her even teeth, behind their screen concealed,<br>   Like melon seeds. Her front cicada-square,<br>   Displayed her eyebrows curved upon its field,<br>     Like horns of silkworm moth; and dimples rare,<br> With dark and lucid eyes, showed face beyond compare. <a name="page_64"><font size="1" color="green">p. 64</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_3">3</a></font></span>  When, on her coming, near the city wall,<br>     She halted in the cultured fields, each eye<br>   Viewed with delight her figure large and tall.<br>     Her team of mettled steeds their bits tossed high,<br>   Round which was twined red cloth in rich supply.<br>   Then in her carriage she went on in state,<br>    Its pheasant screens oft followed by the cry,<br>   "Early retire from court, ye nobles great;<br> The marquis leave unfired, to cherish this fit mate."</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_4">4</a></font></span>  Where out of Ch‘i into our state she passed,<br>     Its banks all green with rush and sedges rank,<br>   Northwards the Ho rolled on the waters vast<br>     Of its majestic stream, while in it sank<br>     With plashing sound the nets, which dripping, drank,<br>   The toiling fishers dropt into the wave,<br>     ’Mong shoals of sturgeon, both the large and lank.<br>   Her sister ladies shone in dresses brave,<br> And martial looked the officers, who escort gave.</p></div>
