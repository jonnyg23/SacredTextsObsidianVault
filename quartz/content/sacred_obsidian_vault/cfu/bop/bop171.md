 <p></p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Ch‘u Ch‘ê</i>; narrative. An ode of congratulation, on the return of the troops from the expedition against the Hsien-yün.</div>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;"><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_1">1</a></font></span>  Forth from the city in our cars we drove,<br>     Until we halted at the pasture ground.<br>   The general came, and there with ardor strove<br>     A note of zeal throughout the host to sound.<br>     "Direct from court I come, by orders bound<br>   The march to hasten;"—it was thus he spake.<br>     Then with the carriage officers around,<br>   He strictly charged them quick dispatch to make:—<br> "Urgent the king's affairs, forthwith the field we take."  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2">2</a></font></span>  While there we stopt, the second corps appeared,<br>     And ’twixt us and the city took its place.<br>   The guiding standard was on high upreared,<br>     Where twining snakes the tortoises embrace,<br>     While oxtails, crestlike, did the staff's top grace.<br>   We watched the sheet unfolding grandly wave;<br>     Each flag around showed falcons on its face.<br>   With anxious care looked on our leader brave;<br> Watchful the carriage officers appeared and grave. <a name="page_199"><font size="1" color="green">p. 199</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_3">3</a></font></span>  Nan Chung, our chief, had heard the royal call<br>     To go where inroad by Hsien-yüns was made,<br>   And ’cross the frontier build a barrier wall.<br>     Numerous his chariots, splendidly arrayed!<br>     The standards—this where dragons were displayed,<br>   And that where snakes round tortoises were coiled<br>     Terrific flew. "Northward our host," he said,<br>   "Heaven's son sends forth to tame the Hsien-yün wild."<br> Soon by this awful chief would all their tribes be foiled.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_4">4</a></font></span>  When first we took the field, and northward went,<br>     The millets were in flower;—a prospect sweet.<br>   Now when our weary steps are homeward bent,<br>     The snow falls fast, the mire impedes our feet.<br>     Many the hardships we were called to meet,<br>   Ere the king's orders we had all fulfilled.<br>     No rest we had; often our friends to greet<br>   The longing came; but vain regrets we stilled;<br> By tablets stern our hearts with fresh resolve were thrilled. <a name="page_200"><font size="1" color="green">p. 200</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_5">5</a></font></span>  "Incessant chirp the insects in the grass;<br>     All round about the nimble hoppers spring.<br>   From them our thoughts quick to our husbands pass,<br>     Although those thoughts our hearts with anguish wring.<br>     Oh! could we see them, what relief ’twould bring!<br>   Our hearts, rejoiced, at once would feel at rest."<br>     Thus did our wives, their case deploring, sing;<br>   The while our leader farther on had pressed,<br> And smitten with his power the wild Jung of the west.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_6">6</a></font></span>  The spring days now are lengthening out their light;<br>     The plants and trees are dressed in living green;<br>   The orioles resting sing, or wing their flight;<br>     Our wives amid the southernwood are seen,<br>     Which white they bring, to feed their silkworms keen.<br>   Our host, returned, sweeps onwards to the hall,<br>     Where chiefs are questioned, shown the captives mean.<br>   Nan Chung, majestic, draws the gaze of all,<br> Proud o’er the barbarous foe his victories to recall.</p></div>
