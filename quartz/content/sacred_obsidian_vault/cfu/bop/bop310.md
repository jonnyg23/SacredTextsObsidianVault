 <p></p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Na;</i> narrative. Appropriate to a sacrifice to Tang the Successful, the real founder of the Shang dynasty,—dwelling especially on the music, and on the reverence with which the service was performed.</div>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">O grand! the drums, both large and for the hand,<br> Complete in number, here in order stand.<br> Their tones, though loud, harmoniously are blent,<br> And rise to greet our ancestor's descent.  
 <p>Him, the great T‘ang, of merit vast, our king<br> Asks by this music to descend, and bring<br> To us, the worshipers, the soothing sense<br> That he, the object of desire intense,<br> Is here. Deep are the sounds the drums emit,<br> And now we hear the flutes, which shrilly fit<br> Into the diapason:—concord great,<br> Which the sonorous gem doth regulate!<br> Majestic is our king of T‘ang's great line,<br> Whose instruments such qualities combine. <a name="page_479"><font size="1" color="green">p. 479</font></a></p>  
 <p>Large bells we hear, which with the drums have place,<br> While in the court the dancers move with grace.<br> Scions of ancient kings the service view,<br> Pleased and delighted, guests of goodness true.<br> Such service we received from former days,<br> Down from our sires, who showed us virtue's ways,—<br> How to be meek and mild, from morn to night,<br> And reverently discharge our parts aright.</p>  
 <p>May T‘ang accept the rites his son thus pays,<br> As round the summer comes, and autumn days!</p></div>
