 <p></p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Ch‘i Yüeh;</i> narrative. Life in Pin in the olden time; the provident arrangements there to secure the constant supply of food and raiment,—whatever was necessary for the support and comfort of the people.</div>

Appears th’ inspector then,<br> Surveys the fields, and cheers the working men. <a name="page_169"><font size="1" color="green">p. 169</font></a>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2">2</a></font></span>The seventh month sees the <i>Ho</i> go down the sky,<br> And in the ninth, the stores warm clothes supply.<br> The warmth begins when come the days of spring,<br> And then their notes we hear the orioles sing.<br> See the young women, with their baskets high,<br> About the mulberry trees their labors ply!<br> The softest leaves, along the paths, they seek,<br> To feed their silkworms, newly hatched and weak.<br> For such, as longer grow the days of spring,<br> In crowds they haste white southernwood to bring.<br> ’Mongst them are some who grieve with wounded heart;—<br> To wed young lords, from parents soon they part!</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_3">3</a></font></span>The seventh month sees the <i>Ho</i> down westward go;<br> The eighth, the reeds and sedges thickly grow.<br> The months the silkworms’ eggs are hatched, they break<br> The mulberry branches, thus their leaves to take; <a name="page_170"><font size="1" color="green">p. 170</font></a><br> And where those branches stretch out far and high,<br> Hatchets and axes on them boldly ply,<br> While younger trees only their leaves supply.<br> In the seventh month, the shrike's notes shrilly sound,<br> And on the eighth, twisting the hemp they're found.<br> Their woven fabrics, dark or yellow dyed,<br> Are valued highly o’er a circle wide.<br> Our brilliant red, the triumph of our art,<br> For young lords’ lower robes is set apart.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_4">4</a></font></span>In the fourth month, the snakeroot bursts the ear;<br> The shrill cicadas in the fifth we hear.<br> When comes the eighth, the ripened grain they crop,<br> And in the tenth the leaves begin to drop.<br> In our first month for badgers quest they make;<br> The wildcat also and the fox they take:—<br> These last the furs for young lords to supply.<br> Our second month, there comes the hunting high,<br> When great and small attend our ruler's car, <a name="page_171"><font size="1" color="green">p. 171</font></a><br> And practice all the exercise of war.<br> The hunters get the younger boars they find;<br> Those three years old are to the prince assigned.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_5">5</a></font></span>The locust in the fifth month beats its thighs;<br> And in the sixth, its wings the spinner plies.<br> The next, we find the crickets in the field;<br> Under our eaves, the eighth, they lie concealed;<br> The ninth, they come and near our doorways keep;<br> The tenth, beneath our beds they slyly creep.<br> The rats we smoke out; chinks we fill up tight;—<br> And close each opening on the north for light,<br> And plaster wicker doors; then each one says,<br> "O wife and children, this year's toiling days<br> Are o’er, and soon another year will come;<br> Enter and dwell in this our cozy home."</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_6">6</a></font></span>For food, the sixth month, plums and vines they spoil;<br> The seventh, the beans and sunflower seeds they boil; <a name="page_172"><font size="1" color="green">p. 172</font></a><br> The eighth, they strike the jujube dates all down;<br> The tenth, they reap the paddy fully grown,<br> And with the grain make spirits ’gainst the spring,<br> Which to the bushy eyebrows comfort bring.<br> In the seventh month, their food the melons make;<br> And in the eighth, the bottle gourds they take.<br> The ninth, in soups hempseed they largely use,<br> Nor <i>Sonchus</i> leaves do they for these refuse.<br> Th’ <i>ailanthus</i> foul, for other use not good,<br> They fell, and then for fuel burn the wood:—<br> ’Tis thus the laborer is supplied with food.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_7">7</a></font></span>In the ninth month, the yards, now stript and bare,<br> They for the produce of the fields prepare.<br> The tenth month sees the carrying all complete,—<br> Of early millets and the late, the wheat,<br> The heap, the pulse,—whatever grain we eat.<br> This labor done, the husbandmen all say,<br> "Our harvest here is well secured. Away<br> To town, and see what for our houses there<br> We need to do, to put them in repair! <a name="page_173"><font size="1" color="green">p. 173</font></a><br> The reeds we'll gather while we have the light,<br> And firmly twist them into ropes at night.<br> Up on the roofs we'll haste with these in hand:—<br> Soon will the fields our time again demand."</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_8">8</a></font></span>Our second month, they, with harmonious blows,<br> Hew out the ice,—housed ere our third month close.<br> The following month, and in the early dawn,<br> They ope the doors;—forth now may ice be drawn;<br> A lamb being offered, after rites of old,<br> With scallions flanked, to him who rules the cold.<br> In the ninth month, the cold begins, with frost;<br> The tenth their cornyards swept and clean they boast.<br> Good spirits, in two vessels kept, they take,<br> To help their joy, and this proposal make:—<br> "We'll kill both lambs and sheep," they joyous say,<br> "And to the ruler's quickly take our way.<br> We'll mount his hall; the massive cup we'll raise,<br> Made of rhinoceros’ horn, and as we praise,<br> Wish him long life, the life of endless days."</p></div>
