 <p></p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Hsiao Jung;</i> narrative. The lady of an officer absent on an expedition against the tribes of the west gives a glowing description of his chariot, and praises himself, expressing, but without murmuring, her regret at his absence.</div>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;"><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_1">1</a></font></span>Before my mind's eye stands my lord's short car,<br> In which he dares the risks of savage war:—<br> Its pole, whose end turns upward, curving round,<br> And in five places shines, with leather bound;<br> The slip rings and the side straps; the masked place,<br> Where gilt rings to the front unite the trace;<br> The mat of tiger's skin; the naves so long;<br> The steeds, with left legs white, and piebalds, strong.<br> Such my lord's car! He rises in my mind,<br> Lovely and bland, like jade of richest kind;<br> Yet there he lives, in his log hut apart:—<br> The very thought confuses all my heart.  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2">2</a></font></span>The driver with the six reins guides along<br> The horses, with their shining coats, and strong:—.<br> One inside dappled, one bay with black mane;<br> Black-mouthed and bay, and black, the outer twain. <a name="page_142"><font size="1" color="green">p. 142</font></a><br> Shields, dragon-figured, rise up side by side,<br> Shelter in front ’gainst missiles to provide.<br> Gilt buckles with the carriage front connect<br> The inner reins by which the insides are checkt.<br> I see my lord, thus in his carriage borne,<br> With his mild form the frontier towns adorn.<br> What time can be for his return assigned?<br> Ah me! his figure ever fills my mind!</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_3">3</a></font></span>With measured steps move the mail-covered team.<br> The trident spears, with gilded shaft ends gleam.<br> The feather-figured shield, of beauty rare,<br> He holds before him, all his foes to dare.<br> The bow case, made of tiger's skin, and bright<br> With metal plates, lies ready for the fight.<br> It holds two bows which bamboo frames secure,<br> And keep unhurt, to send the arrows sure.<br> To him thus busy all my thoughts are borne,<br> Both when I rest at night and rise at morn.<br> He, my good lord, is tranquil and serene,<br> His virtuous fame more prized, the more he's seen.</p></div>
