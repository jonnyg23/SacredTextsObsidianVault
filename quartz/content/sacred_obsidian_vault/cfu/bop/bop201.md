 <p></p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Chêng Yüeh;</i> narrative, allusive, and metaphorical. A lamentation over the miseries of the kingdom, and the ruin coming on it, all through the king's employment of worthless creatures, and his indulgence of his favorite Pao Ssŭ.</div>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;"><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_1">1</a></font></span>On the brow of the summer the hoarfrost abounds;<br>   Sorrow's wound rankles deep in my heart,<br> And calumnies base, that the people perplex,<br>   Daily waxing, inflict sharper smart.<br> All alone I am placed, none by me to stand;<br>   Griefs intense more and more fill my breast.<br> Cares increase and disturb my sorrowful mind;<br>   Both in body and soul I'm distressed.  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2">2</a></font></span>O father and mother who bore me, your son,<br>   Was it only to suffer such woe?<br> Why was I not born ere these evils arrived?<br>   Or why came they ere I am laid low?<br> I hear their good words, which are but from the lip,<br>   And their bad words have no deeper seat.<br> So shallow those men! And the more that I grieve,<br>   With their fiercer contempt do I meet. <a name="page_240"><font size="1" color="green">p. 240</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_3">3</a></font></span>With the pang of great misery wringing my heart,<br>   Dwell I thus on this comfortless time;<br> For the multitudes all will with me be brought<br>   To base servitude, guiltless of crime.<br> And alas for us all in positions more high!<br>   From what lord shall I now get support?<br> No more can I tell than,—see yonder a crow!<br>   Can I tell to whose house ’twill resort.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_4">4</a></font></span>Where the forest once grew, we look, and behold!!<br>   Fagots only and twiglets are left.<br> To Heaven ’midst their perils, the people all look,<br>   And lo! Heaven seems of reason bereft.<br> But is Heaven so dark? When its purpose is fixed,<br>   To its will opposition is vain.<br> And good is the Ruler supreme, the great God!<br>   He hates none of the children of men.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_5">5</a></font></span>’Tis only fools say that the mountains are low;—,<br>   ’Gainst such words each high ridge would protest.<br> And as baseless the talk that is uttered by men, <a name="page_241"><font size="1" color="green">p. 241</font></a><br>   But the king lets it fly unrepressed.<br> To ministers old and diviners of dreams<br>   For advice he repairs, but they say,<br> "We are wise; but of crows which is female, which male,<br>   To pronounce who can tell you the way?"</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_6">6</a></font></span>That the heavens are lofty who is there but knows?<br>   Yet beneath them I bow my head low,<br> And that thick is the earth who is there but feels?<br>   Yet with dainty steps on it I go.<br> For thus speaking and acting good reason I have,<br>   In the conduct of many around,<br> Who originate all those calumnies base,<br>   Like the cobra or eft fatal found.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_7">7</a></font></span>Where the fields are rugged and stony, the grain<br>   Yet luxuriantly rises and grows.<br> Heaven fights against me as if I were its match,<br>   Moves and shakes me, and then overthrows. <a name="page_242"><font size="1" color="green">p. 242</font></a><br> As if I were hidden, they sought me at first,<br>   At the court for a pattern to shine.<br> ’Tis with hatred intense they scowl now on me,<br>   And my services curtly decline.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_8">8</a></font></span>With its sorrow my heart is deeply oppressed;<br>   ’Tis as if with tight string it were bound.<br> Nowadays those who rule no kindness display;<br>   Fierce oppression prevails all around.<br> Blazing flames that spread wide, and terror inspire,<br>   May perhaps still be quenched at their height.<br> But our city august, where Chou holds its state,<br>   Through this vile Szŭ of Pao sinks to night.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_9">9</a></font></span>That such issue will come is ever my thought;<br>   And moreover, O king, let me say,<br> Like a wagoner you, and fast falls the rain!<br>   Heavy load suits but ill miry clay.<br> Wheel aids you may have, but if these you neglect,<br>   And the hands that would help you are spurned,<br> You soon will be crying, "O sir, give me aid,"<br>   When the car of the state is o’erturned. <a name="page_243"><font size="1" color="green">p. 243</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_10">10</a></font></span>If your wheel aids you keep, and get them well plied,<br>   That their help they shall give to each spoke,<br> And keep on the driver a vigilant eye,<br>   Then your carriage will travel unbroke.<br> Your load will be safe, and your journey will come,<br>   Though most rugged and hard, to its end;<br> But these things seem trifles, as looked upon now;<br>   To the peril you will not attend.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_11">11</a></font></span>Shallow ponds on the fish small pleasure bestow;<br>   To the bottom they dive, and there lie.<br> But the fisherman sharp them clearly perceives,<br>   And a prey to his cunning they die.<br> And so, men of worth, in this kingdom oppressed,<br>   Little pleasure can ever possess;<br> For hatred pursues them, where’er they may hide.<br>   How such things fill my heart with distress!</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_12">12</a></font></span>Clear sparkle the spirits, set forth at their feasts,<br>   And the mats with fine viands are crowned.<br> Neighbors there and their kindred in numbers appear,<br>   And the halls with their praises resound.<br> So is it with those, the unworthy and base;<br>   Such reward by their flattery they gain; <a name="page_244"><font size="1" color="green">p. 244</font></a><br> While here I am left, and in solitude pine,<br>   Struggling hard with my grief and my pain.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_13">13</a></font></span>Though mean, they are gifted with houses and lands;<br>   Abjects vile, they their salaries draw;<br> But the people endure a hard, famished lot,<br>   And are dealt with by Heaven's sternest law.<br> Rich men may succeed in a time so severe;<br>   With their wealth and their stores they can live.<br> But alas for the poor, alone, without help!<br>   Should the king not deliverance give?</p></div>
