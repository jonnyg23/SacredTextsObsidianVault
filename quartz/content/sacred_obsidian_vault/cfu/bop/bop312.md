 <p></p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Hsüan Niao;</i> narrative. Appropriate to a sacrifice in the ancestral temple of Shang:—intended specially to do honor to the king Wu-ting and the celebrating monarch.</div>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">By Heaven sent down, the swallow came to earth,<br> And gave to our great Ch‘i his mystic birth.<br> The sire of Shang, his children long abode<br> In Yin-land, waxing great. Thereafter God<br> Give to the martial T‘ang his charge, that he<br> Should to each state assign its boundary.  
 <p>T‘ang grandly thus possessed the regions nine,<br> And to each quarter did its lords assign.<br> First lord of Shang, the sovereign power who swayed,<br> He got his charge, certain and stable made.<br> Thus to our king the throne. Wu-ting conveyed.</p>  
 <p>Wu-ting's descendant is a martial king,<br> Whose powers, however taxed, still victory bring.<br> Ten lords, whose chariots dragon banners grace,<br> His millet dishes in due order place. <a name="page_482"><font size="1" color="green">p. 482</font></a></p>  
 <p>A thousand li extends the king's domain,<br> And there the people to repose are fain.<br> Lo! to the four seas thence our borders spread,<br> And from the space within there come to aid<br> Our temple service many chiefs arrayed.<br> Our hill of King for border has the Ho.<br> ’Twas right the sovereignty to Shang should go;<br> And from its ruler now all honors flow.</p></div>
