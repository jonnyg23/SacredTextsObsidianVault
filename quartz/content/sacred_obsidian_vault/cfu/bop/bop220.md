Now to the ground I go,<br> Where their rich soil the southern acres show.<br> Some weed; some gather earth around the roots;<br> Each millet plant luxuriantly upshoots.<br> There I call round me in a spacious place<br> The brightest youths, with cheering words to grace.  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2">2</a></font></span>Heaped in the vessels, bright the millet shone;<br> Pure were the victim rams. Last harvest done,<br> We thanked the spirits of the land and air,<br> From whom the joyous husbandmen declare<br> The copious produce of the year had come.<br> Now without lutes and the resounding drum,<br> To him who taught men tillage first we cry,<br> And ask for rain to help our husbandry. <a name="page_290"><font size="1" color="green">p. 290</font></a><br> So shall our millets grow. Each field now thrives,<br> To bless our laborers, and bless their wives.</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_4">4</a></font></span>The reapers soon the crops will take in hand,<br> Which curving down, and thick as thatch, shall stand.<br> Lo! numerous stacks are built all o’er the grounds,<br> Rising like islands, seen from far like mounds.<br> Thousands of granaries must our lord prepare,<br> And carts in myriads home their loads shall bear.<br> With radiant joy each husbandman surveys<br> The millets stored, the rice crop and the maize.<br> Then all shall pray for blessing on our lord,<br> For myriad years.—Such shall be his reward!</p></div>
