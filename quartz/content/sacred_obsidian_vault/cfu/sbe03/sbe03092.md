   <h5 align="center">ODE 3. THE <i>K</i>ING <i>K</i>IH.</h5>  <h5>KING <i>KH</i>ĂNG SHOWS HIS SENSE OF WHAT WAS REQUIRED OF HIM TO PRESERVE THE FAVOUR OF HEAVEN, A CONSTANT JUDGE; INTIMATES HIS GOOD PURPOSES; AND ASKS THE HELP OF HIS MINISTERS TO BE ENABLED TO PERFORM THEM.</h5>  
 <p>Let me be reverent! Let me be reverent! (The way of) Heaven is evident, And its appointment</p>  
 <p><a name="page_330"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 330</font></a></p>  
 <p>is not easily preserved <a name="fr_378"></a><a href="#fn_365"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Let me not say that it is high aloft above me. It ascends and descends about our doings; It daily inspects us wherever we are.</p>  
 <p>I am a little child, Without intelligence to be reverently (attentive to my duties); But by daily progress and monthly advance, I will learn to hold fast the gleams (of knowledge), till I arrive at bright intelligence. Assist me to bear the burden (of my position), And show me how to display a virtuous conduct.</p>
