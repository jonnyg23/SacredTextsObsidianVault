   <h4 align="center">ODE 7, STANZAS 1 AND PART OF 3. THE HAN YÎ.</h4>  <h4>CELEBRATING THE MARQUIS OF HAN:--HIS INVESTITURE, AND THE KING'S CHARGE TO HIM; THE GIFTS HE RECEIVED, AND THE PARTING FEAST AT THE COURT; HIS MARRIAGE; THE EXCELLENCE OF HIS TERRITORY; AND HIS SWAY OVER THE REGIONS OF THE NORTH.</h4>  
 <p><font size="-1">Only one line--the first of stanza 3--in this interesting piece serves to illustrate the religious practices of the time, and needs no further note than what has been given on the first line of stanza 7 in the preceding ode. The name of the marquisate of Han remains in the district of Han-<i>kh</i>ăng, department of Hsî-an, Shen-hsî, in which also is mount Liang.</font></p>  
 <p>Very grand is the mountain of Liang, Which was made cultivable by Yü. Bright is the way from it, (Along which came) the marquis of Han to receive investiture. The king in person gave the charge:--'Continue the services of your ancestors; Let not my charge to you come to nought. Be diligent early and late, And reverently discharge your duties:--So shall my appointment of you not change. Be a support against those princes who do not come to court, Thus assisting your sovereign.'</p>  
 <p>When the marquis of Han left the court, he sacrificed to the spirit of the road. He went forth, and lodged for the night in Tû.</p>
