 <p><a name="fn_461"></a><a href="sbe03124.htm#fr_477">373:4</a> The greenbeaks appeared in the second ode of the fifth decade. The bird had many names, and a beautiful plumage, <a name="page_374"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 374</font></a> made use of here to compliment the princes on the elegance of their manners, and perhaps also the splendour of their equipages. The bird is here called the 'mulberry Hû,' because it appeared when the mulberry tree was coming into leaf.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_462"></a><a href="sbe03124.htm#fr_478">374:1</a> This line is to be understood, with <i>K</i>û Hsî, as a prayer of the king to Heaven for his lords.</p>
