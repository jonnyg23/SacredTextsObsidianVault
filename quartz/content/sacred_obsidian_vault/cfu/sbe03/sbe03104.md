 <p>On the trees go the blows <i>k</i>ăng-<i>k</i>ăng; And the birds cry out ying-ying. One issues from the dark valley, And removes to the lofty tree. Ying goes its cry, Seeking with its voice its companion. Look at the bird, Bird as it is, seeking with its. voice its companion; And shall a man Not seek to have his friends? Spiritual beings will then hearken to him <a name="fr_418"></a><a href="#fn_404"><font size="1">1</font></a>; He shall have harmony and peace.</p>
