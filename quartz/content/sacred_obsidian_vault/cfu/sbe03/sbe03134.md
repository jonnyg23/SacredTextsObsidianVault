 <p><a name="fn_524"></a><a href="sbe03134.htm#fr_543">393:2</a> 'The three sovereigns,' or 'wise kings,' are to be understood of the three celebrated in ode 7,--Thâi, Kî, and Wan. We are thus obliged, with all Chinese scholars, to understand this ode of king Wû. The statement that 'the three kings were in heaven' is very express.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_525"></a><a href="sbe03134.htm#fr_544">393:3</a> The capital here is Hâo, to which Wû removed in B.C. 1134, the year after his father's death. It was on the east of the river Făng, and only about eight miles from Wăn's capital of Făng.</p>
