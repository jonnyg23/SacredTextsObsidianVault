   <h4 align="center">ODE 4, STANZAS 1 AND 2. THE MĂNG.</h4>  <h4 align="center">AN UNFORTUNATE WOMAN, WHO HAD BEEN SEDUCED INTO AN IMPROPER CONNEXION, NOW CAST OFF, RELATES AND BEMOANS HER SAD CASE.</h4>

I pray you be not angry, And let autumn be the time.'</p>

'Then come,' (I said), 'with your carriage, And I will remove with my goods.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_611"></a><a href="sbe03165.htm#fr_631">438:3</a> Fû-kwan must have been the place where the man lived, according to <i>K</i>û. Rather, it must have been a pass (Fû-kwan may mean 'the gate or pass of Fû'), through which he would come, and was visible from near the residence of the woman.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_612"></a><a href="sbe03165.htm#fr_632">438:4</a> Ying tâ observes that the man had never divined about the matter, and said that he had done so only to complete the process of seduction.
