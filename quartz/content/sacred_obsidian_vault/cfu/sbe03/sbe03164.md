   <h3 align="center">BOOK V. THE ODES OF WEI.</h3>  
 <p>IT has been said on the title of Book iii, that Wei at first was the eastern portion of the old domain of the kings of Shang. With this a brother of king Wû, called Khang-shû, was invested. The principality was afterwards increased by the absorption of Phei and Yung. It came to embrace portions of the present provinces of <i>K</i>ih-lî, Shan-tung, and Ho-nan. It outlasted the dynasty of <i>K</i>âu itself, the last prince of Wei being reduced to the ranks of the people only during the dynasty of <i>Kh</i>in.</p>
