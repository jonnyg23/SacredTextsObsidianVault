 <h1 align="CENTER">THE KASÎDAH</h1>
 <h2 align="CENTER">I</h2>
 <p>THE hour is nigh; the waning Queen<br>
 walks forth to rule the later night;<br>
 Crown'd with the sparkle of a Star,<br>
 and throned on orb of ashen light:</p>
 <p>The Wolf-tail<sup>[1]</sup> sweeps the paling East<br>
 to leave a deeper gloom behind,<br>
 And Dawn uprears her shining head,<br>
 sighing with semblance of a wind:</p>
 <p>The highlands catch yon Orient gleam,<br>
 while purpling still the lowlands lie;<br>
 And pearly mists, the morning-pride,<br>
 soar incense-like to greet the sky.</p>
 <p>The horses neigh, the camels groan,<br>
 the torches gleam, the cressets flare;<br>
 The town of canvas falls, and man<br>
 with din and dint invadeth air:</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[1. The False Dawn.]</p>
 </font><p>{p. 10}</p>
 <p>The Golden Gates swing right and left;<br>
 up springs the Sun with flamy brow;<br>
 The dew-cloud melts in gush of light;<br>
 brown Earth is bathed in morning-glow.</p>
 <p>Slowly they wind athwart the wild,<br>
 and while young Day his anthem swells,<br>
 Sad falls upon my yearning ear<br>
 The tinkling of the camel-bells:</p>
 <p>O'er fiery wastes and frozen wold,<br>
 o'er horrid hill and gloomy glen,<br>
 The home of grisly beast and Ghoul<sup>[1]</sup>,<br>
 the haunts of wilder, grislier men;--</p>
 <p>With the brief gladness of the Palms,<br>
 that tower and sway o'er seething plain,<br>
 Fraught with the thoughts of rustling shade,<br>
 and welling spring, and rushing rain;</p>
 <p>With the short solace of the ridge,<br>
 by gentle zephyrs played upon,<br>
 Whose breezy head and bosky side<br>
 front seas of cooly celadon;--</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[1. The Demon of the Desert.]</p>
 </font><p>{p. 11}</p>
 <p>'Tis theirs to pass with joy and hope,<br>
 whose souls shall ever thrill and fill<br>
 Dreams of the Birthplace and the Tomb,<br>
 visions of Allah's Holy Hill.<sup>[1]</sup></p>
 <p>But we? Another shift of scene,<br>
 another pang to rack the heart;<br>
 Why meet we on the bridge of Time<br>
 to 'change one greeting and to part?</p>
 <p>We meet to part; yet asks my sprite,<br>
 Part we to meet? Ah! is it so?<br>
 Man's fancy-made Omniscience knows,<br>
 who made Omniscience nought can know.</p>
 <p>Why must we meet, why must we part,<br>
 why must we bear this yoke of MUST,<br>
 Without our leave or askt or given,<br>
 by tyrant Fate on victim thrust?</p>
 <p>That Eve so gay, so bright, so glad,<br>
 this Morn so dim, and sad, and grey;<br>
 Strange that life's Registrar should write<br>
 this day a day, that day a day</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[1. Arafât, near Mecca.]</p>
 </font><p>{p. 12}</p>
 <p>Mine eyes, my brain., my heart, are sad,<br>
 sad is the very core of me;<br>
 All wearies, changes, passes, ends;<br>
 alas! the Birthday's injury!</p>
 <p>Friends of my youth, a last adieu!<br>
 haply some day we meet again;<br>
 Yet ne'er the self-same men shall meet;<br>
 the years shall make us other men:</p>
 <p>The light of morn has grown to noon,<br>
 has paled with eve, and now farewell!<br>
 Go, vanish from my Life as dies<br>
 the tinkling of the camel's bell.</p>
 <p>{p. 13}</p>
