 <h1 align="CENTER">VII</h1>
 <p>MAN hath no Soul, a state of things,<br>
 a no-thing still, a sound, a word<br>
 Which so begets substantial thing<br>
 that eye shall see what ear hath heard.</p>
 <p>Where was his Soul the savage beast<br>
 which in primeval forests strayed,<br>
 What shape had it, what dwelling-place,<br>
 what part in nature's plan it played?</p>
 <p>This Soul to ree a riddle made;<br>
 who wants the vain duality?<br>
 Is not myself enough for me?<br>
 what need of "I" within an "I"?</p>
 <p>Words, words that gender things!<br>
 The soul is a new-comer on the scene;<br>
 Sufficeth not the breath of Life<br>
 to work the matter-born machine?</p>
 <p>{p. 46}</p>
 <p>We know the Gen'esis of the Soul;<br>
 we trace the Soul to hour of birth;<br>
 We mark its growth as grew mankind<br>
 to boast himself sole Lord of Earth:</p>
 <p>The race of Be'ing from dawn of Life<br>
 in an unbroken course was run;<br>
 What men are pleased to call their Souls<br>
 was in the hog and dog begun:</p>
 <p>Life is a ladder infinite-stepped,<br>
 that hides its rungs from human eyes;<br>
 Planted its foot in chaos-gloom,<br>
 its head soars high above the skies:</p>
 <p>No break the chain of Being bears;<br>
 all things began in unity;<br>
 And lie the links in regular line<br>
 though haply none the sequence see.</p>
 <p>The Ghost, embodied natural Dread<br>
 of dreary death and foul decay,<br>
 Begat the Spirit, Soul and Shade<br>
 with Hades' pale and wan array.</p>
 <p>{p. 47}</p>
 <p>The Soul required a greater Soul,<br>
 a Soul of Souls, to rule the host;<br>
 Hence spirit-powers and hierarchies,<br>
 all gendered by the savage Ghost.</p>
 <p>Not yours, ye Peoples of the Book,<br>
 these fairy visions fair and fond,<br>
 Got by the gods of Khemi-land<sup>[1]</sup><br>
 and faring far the seas beyond!</p>
 <p>"Th' immortal mind of mortal man!"<br>
 we hear yon loud-lunged Zealot cry;<br>
 Whose mind but means his sum of thought,<br>
 an essence of atomic "I."</p>
 <p>Thought is the work of brain and nerve,<br>
 in small-skulled idiot poor and mean;<br>
 In sickness sick, in sleep asleep,<br>
 and dead when Death lets drop the scene.</p>
 <p>"Tush!" quoth the Zâhid, "well we ken<br>
 the teaching of the school abhorr'd<br>
 "That maketh man automaton,<br>
 mind a secretion, soul a word."</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[1. Egypt; Kam, Kem, Khem (hierogl.), in the Demotic Khemi.]</p>
 </font><p>{p. 48}</p>
 <p>"Of molecules and protoplasm<br>
 you matter-mongers prompt to prate;<br>
 "Of jelly-speck development and apes<br>
 that grew to man's estate."</p>
 <p>Vain cavil! all that is hath come<br>
 either by Mir'acle or by Law;--<br>
 Why waste on this your hate and fear,<br>
 why waste on that your love and awe?</p>
 <p>Why heap such hatred on a word,<br>
 why "Prototype" to type assign,<br>
 Why upon matter spirit mass?<br>
 Wants an appendix your design?</p>
 <p>Is not the highest honour his<br>
 who from the worst hath drawn the best;<br>
 May not your Maker make the world<br>
 from matter, an it suit His hest?</p>
 <p>Nay more, the sordider the stuff<br>
 the cunninger the workman's hand:<br>
 Cease, then, your own Almighty Power<br>
 to bind, to bound, to understand.</p>
 <p>{p. 49}</p>
 <p>"Reason and Instinct!" How we love<br>
 to play with words that please our pride;<br>
 Our noble race's mean descent<br>
 by false forged titles seek to hide</p>
 <p>For "gift divine" I bid you read<br>
 the better work of higher brain,<br>
 From Instinct differing in degree<br>
 as golden mine from leaden vein.</p>
 <p>Reason is Life's sole arbiter,<br>
 the magic Laby'rinth's single clue:<br>
 Worlds lie above, beyond its ken;<br>
 what crosses it can ne'er be true.</p>
 <p>"Fools rush where Angels fear to tread!"<br>
 Angels and Fools have equal claim<br>
 To do what Nature bids them do,<br>
 sans hope of praise, sans fear of blame!</p>
 <p>{p. 50}</p>
