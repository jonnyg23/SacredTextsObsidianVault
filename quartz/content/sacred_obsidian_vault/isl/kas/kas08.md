 <p>ALL Faith is false, all Faith is true:<br>
 Truth is the shattered mirror strown<br>
 In myriad bits; while each believes<br>
 his little bit the whole to own.</p>
 <p>What is the Truth? was askt of yore.<br>
 Reply all object Truth is one<br>
 As twain of halves aye makes a whole;<br>
 the moral Truth for all is none.</p>
 <p>Ye scantly-learned Zâhids learn<br>
 from Aflatûn and Aristû,<sup>[1]</sup><br>
 While Truth is real like your good:<br>
 th' Untrue, like ill, is real too;</p>
 <p>As palace mirror'd in the stream,<br>
 as vapour mingled with the skies,<br>
 So weaves the brain of mortal man<br>
 the tangled web of Truth and Lies.</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[1. Plato and Aristotle.]</p>
 </font><p>What see we here? Forms, nothing more!<br>
 Forms fill the brightest, strongest eye,<br>
 We know not substance; 'mid the shades<br>
 shadows ourselves we live and die.</p>
 <p>"Faith mountains move" I hear:<br>
 I see the practice of the world unheed<br>
 The foolish vaunt, the blatant boast<br>
 that serves our vanity to feed.</p>
 <p>"Faith stands unmoved;" and why?<br>
 Because man's silly fancies still remain,<br>
 And will remain till wiser man<br>
 the day-dreams of his youth disdain.</p>
 <p>"'Tis blessèd to believe;" you say:<br>
 The saying may be true enow<br>
 And it can add to Life a light:--<br>
 only remains to show us how.</p>
 <p>E'en if I could I nould believe<br>
 your tales and fables stale and trite,<br>
 Irksome as twice-sung tune that tires<br>
 the dullèd ear of drowsy wight.</p>
 <p>{p. 43}</p>
 <p>With God's foreknowledge man's free will!<br>
 what monster-growth of human brain,<br>
 What powers of light shall ever pierce<br>
 this puzzle dense with words inane?</p>
 <p>Vainly the heart on Providence calls,<br>
 such aid to seek were hardly wise<br>
 For man must own the pitiless Law<br>
 that sways the globe and sevenfold skies.</p>
 <p>"Be ye Good Boys, go seek for Heav'en,<br>
 come pay the priest that holds the key;"<br>
 So spake, and speaks, and aye shall speak<br>
 the last to enter Heaven,--he.</p>
 <p>Are these the words for men to hear?<br>
 yet such the Church's general tongue,<br>
 The horseleech-cry so strong so high<br>
 her heav'enward Psalms and Hymns among.</p>
 <p>What? Faith a merit and a claim,<br>
 when with the brain 'tis born and bred?<br>
 Go, fool, thy foolish way and dip<br>
 in holy water burièd dead!</p>
 <p>{p. 44}</p>
 <p>Yet follow not th' unwisdom-path,<br>
 cleave not to this and that disclaim;<br>
 Believe in all that man believes;<br>
 here all and naught are both the same.</p>
 <p>But is it so? How may we know?<br>
 Haply this Fate, this Law may be<br>
 A word, a sound, a breath; at most<br>
 the Zâhid's moonstruck theory.</p>
 <p>Yes Truth may be, but 'tis not Here;<br>
 mankind must seek and find it There,<br>
 But Where nor I nor you can tell,<br>
 nor aught earth-mother ever bare.</p>
 <p>Enough to think that Truth can be:<br>
 come sit we where the roses glow,<br>
 Indeed he knows not how to know<br>
 who knows not also how to 'unknow.</p>
 <p>{p. 45}</p>
