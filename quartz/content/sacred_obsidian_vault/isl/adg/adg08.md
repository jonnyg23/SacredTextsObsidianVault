 <p>The prince of believers  (puh) said:</p>  
 <p>1. People are enemies  for what they do not know.<br> 2. If a man has a famous character in him, then wait for its sisters.<br> 3. If the ability was available, lust is lowered down.<br> 4. In the turning of the situations, the cores of men are known.<br> 5. Every type goes to a type like it.<br> 6. Every person goes to a person like him.<br> 7. The necessities of the situations humiliates the necks of men.<br> 8. The most eloquent speech is what said by the tongue of the situation.<br> 9. The most eloquent complaint is what to be said by the apparent adversity.</p>
