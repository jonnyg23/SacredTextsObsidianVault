   <h3 align="center">4. <i>The Poets</i></h3>  
 <p>Eastern Iran had been hospitable to Ṡūfism, and with the development of Persian vernacular literature from the eleventh century onward, Ṡūfī poets made an immortal</p>  
 <p><a name="page_156"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 156</font></a></p>  
 <p>contribution to Islamic literature. This was particularly true wherever Persian became the literary language--chiefly those areas where Arabic was not (Persia, Turkey, India, Central Asia), and with the devastation of the Eastern Islamic world by the Mongol invasions of the thirteenth century and the career of Tīmūr (Tamerlane) in the fourteenth this tendency became stronger; Ṡūfism succeeded in offering men a vision of beauty and some consolation in an exceedingly chaotic and cruel time, and some of Persia's greatest poets wrote in the age of the Mongols.</p>  
 <p>A younger eleventh-century contemporary of Abū Sa‘īd ibn Abī Khayr was ‘Abdallah al-Anṡārī (died A.H. 481/A.D. 1088), the patron saint of Herat in Khurasan. Pīr-i-Anṡār, as he is better known, composed the earliest Persian devotional poetry known, though not all the verses ascribed to him by later generations are his.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">Thou, Whose breath is sweetest perfume to the spent and anguished heart,<br> Thy remembrance to Thy lovers bringeth ease for every smart.<br> Multitudes like Moses, reeling, cry to earth's remotest place<br> "<i>Give me sight</i>, O Lord," they clamor, seeking to behold Thy face.<br> Multitudes no man hath numbered, lovers, and afflicted all,<br> Stumbling on the way of anguish, "Allah, Allah" loudly call.<br> And the fire of separation sears the heart and burns the breast,<br> And their eyes are wet with weeping for a love that gives not rest.<br> "Poverty's my pride!" Thy lovers raise to heaven their battle-cry,</font></dir>

 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">Gladly meeting men's derision, letting all the world go by.<br> Such a fire of passion's potion Pīr-i-Anṡār quaffing feels,<br> That distraught, like Layla's lover<br>   through a ruined world he reels.  
 <p>Oh God, accept my plea,<br> And to my faults indulgent be.<br> Oh God, all my days have I spent in vanity,<br> And against my own body have I wrought iniquity.</p>  
 <p>Oh God, do Thou bless<br>   for this is not given to any man,<br> And do Thou caress,<br>   for this no other can.</p>  
 <p>Oh God, though succory is bitter,<br>   yet in the garden with the rose it blends;<br> And though ‘Abdallah be a sinner<br>   yet is he among Thy friends.</p>  
 <p>Oh God, Thou saidst, "Do this," and didst not let me;<br> Thou badest, "Do this not," and didst permit me.<br> Small profit was my coming yesterday:<br> Today life's market's not more thronged or gay.<br> Tomorrow I shall go unknowing hence.<br> Far better were it to have stayed away.</p>  
 <p>Know that God Most High has built an outward<br>   Ka'ba out of mud and stone,<br> And fashioned an inward Ka'ba of heart and soul alone.<br>   The outward Ka'ba Abraham did build,<br> The inward Ka'ba was as the Lord Almighty willed.</p>  
 <p>Oh God, in gold and silver the rich take pride:<br> The poor resign themselves to <i>We do decide</i>. (Sūra 43:31)</p></font></dir>

 <p><i>Farīd al-Dīn ‘Aṭṭār</i>: A native of Nishapur, ‘Aṭṭār is usually believed to have perished in Genghis Khan's invasion of Khurasan, in A.H. 617/A.D. 1220. He was a druggist, who collected the sayings and teachings of Ṡūfī saints, and is credited with a very considerable literary output. His Persian poems show great story-telling ability, as well as devotion to the memory of al-Ḥallāj and, in common with other later Persian mystic poets, a clear pantheistic bias. It is not always clear how much of this is conviction, and how much poetic license; how much philosophy, and how much edifying literature; the poets and their admirers frequently found it advisable to leave that undefined. The following is the culmination of his long mystical epic, <i>Manṭiq al-Ṭayr</i>.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">The sun of my Perfection is a Glass<br> Wherein from <i>Seeing</i> into <i>Being</i> pass<br> All who, reflecting as reflected see<br> Themselves in Me, and Me in them, not Me,<br> But all of Me that a contracted Eye<br> Is comprehensive of Infinity.<br> Not yet <i>Themselves</i>; no Selves, but of the All<br> Fractions, from which they split and whither fall.<br> As Water lifted from the Deep, again<br> Falls back in individual Drops of Rain--<br> Then melts into the Universal Main.<br> All you have been, and seen, and done, and thought,<br> Not <i>You</i> but <i>I</i>, have seen and been and wrought;<br> I was the Sin that from Myself rebell’d,<br> I the Remorse that tow’rd Myself compelled:</font></dir>

 <p> </p>  
 <p>In this poem, ‘Aṭṭār gives a new meaning to the <i>bilā kayf</i> of the orthodox--the doctrine that certain mysteries of faith must be accepted "without asking how."</p>

 <p><i>Ibn al-Fāriḍ</i>: A contemporary and friend of Ibn al-‘Arabī was ‘Umar ibn al-Fāriḍ of Cairo (died A.H. 632/A.D. 1235), the greatest mystical poet who wrote in Arabic, the only one who can compare to the great Persian Stiff poets. He was venerated as a saint during his lifetime, and like other mystics is said to have written as the result of ecstatic inspiration. His odes, like those of St. John of the Cross, are tender and rapturous addresses to God as Absolute Beauty; at times, his imagery seems almost Keatsian.</p>

 <p><i>Jalāl al-Dīn Rūmī</i>: Rūmī (died 1273), the theologian of Persian poetry, came of an East Persian family which emigrated to Konya, the Saljūq capital of Muslim Anatolia (Ram), shortly before the Mongol invasions devastated Persia and Iraq. As it passed through Nishapur, the family is said to have visited the aged ‘Aṭṭār, who predicted the infant Jalāl al-Dīn's future greatness.</p>  
 <p>In Konya, Jalāl al-Dīn succeeded his father as professor in a madrasa, or college for training of <i>‘ulamā’</i>. Already something of a Ṡūfī, he came under the powerful influence of the Ṡūfī Shams al-Dīn Tabrīzī, who visited Konya and who played Socrates to Rūmī's Plato. Rūmī left off teaching and became a changed man. His devotion to this eccentric and enthusiastic friend and master out-raged his disciples, and they forced Tabrīzī to leave the city. At the pleading of Rūmī he twice returned, and was finally killed by an angry mob. In acknowledgment of the debt he owed him, Rūmī called his own collection of poems (<i>Diwān</i>), The Diwān of Shams-i-Tabrīz.</p>  
 <p>But Rūmī's greatest work is his <i>Mathnavī</i>, "The Qur’ān of the Persian Language," a vast poem containing fables, allegories and reflections on Ṡūfī thought. While it has little artistic unity, being apparently written in periods of inspiration over a long space of time, it is a poetic work of unquestioned genius, erudition and deep religious feeling.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_163"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 163</font></a></p>  
 <p>Rūmī also founded the Mawlāwī or Mevlevi brother-hood, the "Whirling Dervishes," whose mystical dance in the <i>samā‘</i>, to recall the order of the heavenly spheres, is a sedate gyrating. Sections of the <i>Mathnavī</i> or the <i>Diwān</i> such as the superb opening "Song of the Reed Flute," from the <i>Mathnavī</i>, which plaintively tells of the soul's longing for God, the Source of its existence, were chanted at these sessions.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">Listen to the tale of the reed flute,<br> Complaining of the pain of separation:<br> "Since they tore me from the reed-bed,<br> My laments move man and woman to tears.<br> O, for a bosom torn like mine with the wound of severance,<br> That I may tell it of the pain of longing!<br> He who is far from his place of origin<br> Longs for the Day of the Return.<br> In every company I tell my wailing song.<br> I have consorted with the unhappy and the joyous;<br> Each one becomes my friend for his own sake;<br> None asks the secrets of my heart.<br> My secret is not far from my plaint,<br> But eye and ear lack light to discern it."<br> Body from Soul and Soul from body are not veiled,<br> Yet to none is it given to see the Soul.<br> A fire is this noise of the reed-flute!<br> May whoso has no fire be nought.<br> The fire of Love has caught the reed;<br> The ferment of Love has changed the wine.<br> The reed is comrade to him who has lost his Friend,<br> Its strains rend the veil from our hearts. . . .<br> It tells of the mystic path of blood,<br> It recounts the love of Majnūn for Layla.<br> In our woe life's days are grown untimely;<br> My days move hand in hand with anguish.<br> Though they pass away thus, let them go!</font></dir>

 <p><i>Jāmī</i>: The Mongols were driven from Iran by the terrible Tīmūr (Tamerlane) in the fourteenth century--a Transoxanian Turk who was as great a catastrophe for the Muslim lands he ravaged as the early Mongols had ever</p>  
 <p><a name="page_166"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 166</font></a></p>  
 <p>been. However, in the fifteenth century his descendants, the Tīmūrī dynasty in Eastern Persia, patronized a brilliant revival of Persian-Islamic culture, the "Tīmūrī Renaissance." One of the chief ornaments of the Tīmūrī court in Herat was the last great mystical poet to write in Persian, Mulla Nūr al-Dīn ‘Abd al-Rahmān Jāmī (died A.H. 898/A.D. 1492). By 1507 the wild Uzbeks of Central Asia had destroyed the Tīmūrī power (although a prince of the Tīmūrī line was to found the Great Mughal dynasty of Delhi).</p>  
 <p>A practicing mystic, deeply influenced by the ideas of Ibn al-‘Arabī, Jāmī was also a scholar, a biographer and a poet of great and varied accomplishment.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p><font size="-1">Notwithstanding his piety and mysticism, Jāmī had a sharp tongue and was ready at repartee. Thus on one occasion he was repeating with fervour the line:</font></p>  
 <p></p><dir>So constantly art thou in my stricken soul and sleep-less eye<br> That whosoever should appear from afar, I should think it was thou.</dir>  
 <p>An irreverent bystander interrupted him with the question, "Suppose it were an ass?" "I should think it was thou," replied Jāmī <a name="fr_123"></a><a href="#fn_123"><font size="1">44</font></a>."</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p>On another occasion, Jāmī thus silenced a poet of the court who had accused his fellow poets of plagiarism.</p>  
 <p></p><dir>We poets, Sāgharī maintains,<br> Steal his ideas and pen them.<br> It must be true--I've read his poems:<br> There's not an idea in them. <a name="fr_124"></a><a href="#fn_124"><font size="1">45</font></a></dir>

 <p>The following is from his long poem Yūsuf and Zulaykhā.</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="-1">Each speck of matter did He constitute<br> A mirror, causing each one to reflect<br> The beauty of His Visage. From the rose<br> Flashed forth His Beauty, and the nightingale<br> Beholding it, loved madly. From that Light<br> The candle drew the lustre which beguiles<br> The moth to immolation. On the sun<br> His Beauty shone, and straightway from the wave<br> The lotus reared its head. Each shining lock<br> Of Leylā's hair attracted Majnūn's heart<br> Because some ray divine reflected shone<br> In her fair face. ’Twas He to Shīrīn's lips<br> Who lent that sweetness which had power to steal<br> The heart from Parvīz and from Ferhād life.  
 <p>His Beauty everywhere doth show itself,<br> And through the forms of earthly beauties shines<br> Obscured as through a veil. He did reveal<br> His face through Joseph's coat, and so destroyed<br> Zulaykhā's peace. Where’er thou seest a veil,<br> Beneath that veil He hides. Whatever heart<br> Doth yield to love, He charms it. In his love<br> The heart hath life. Longing for Him, the soul<br> Hath victory. That heart which seems to love<br> The fair ones of this world, loves Him alone.<br> Beware! say not, "He is All Beautiful,<br> And we His lovers." Thou art but the glass,<br> And He the face confronting it, which casts<br> Its image on the mirror. He alone.</p>  
 <p>Is manifest, and thou in truth art hid,<br> Pure Love, like Beauty, coming but from Him,<br> Reveals itself in thee. If steadfastly<br> Thou canst regard, thou wilt at length perceive<br> He is the mirror also--He alike<br> The Treasure and the Casket. "I" and "Thou"<br> Have here no place, and are but fantasies<br> Vain and unreal. Silence! for this tale</p></font></dir>
