 <p><a name="page_1133"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1133</font></a></p>  <h3 align="center">Sūra XXXIV.</h3>  <h3 align="center"><i>Sabā,</i> or the City of Sabā</h3>  
 <p>(see verse 15).</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of God, Most Gracious,<br> Most Merciful.</i></p>  
 <p>1. Praise be to God,<br> To Whom belong all things<br> In the heavens and on earth:<br> To Him be Praise<br> In the Hereafter:<br> And He is Full of Wisdom,<br> Acquainted with all things.</p>  
 <p>2. He knows all that goes<br> Into the earth, and all that<br> Comes out thereof; all that<br> Comes down from the sky<br> And all that ascends thereto<br> And He is the Most Merciful,<br> The Oft-Forgiving.</p>  
 <p>3. The Unbelievers say,<br> "Never to us will come</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1134"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1134</font></a></p>  
 <p>The Hour": say, "Nay!<br> But most surely,<br> By my Lord, it will come<br> Upon you;—by Him<br> Who knows the unseen,—<br> From Whom is not hidden<br> The least little atom<br> In the Heavens or on earth:<br> Nor is there anything less<br> Than that, or greater, but<br> Is in the Record Perspicuous:</p>  
 <p>4. That He may reward<br> Those who believe and work<br> Deeds of righteousness: for such<br> Is Forgiveness and a Sustenance<br> Most Generous."</p>  
 <p>5. But those who strive<br> Against Our Signs, to frustrate<br> Them,—for such will be<br> A Penalty,—a Punishment<br> Most humiliating.</p>  
 <p>6. And those to whom<br> Knowledge has come see<br> That the (Revelation) sent down<br> To thee from thy Lord—<br> That is the Truth,<br> And that it guides</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1135"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1135</font></a></p>  
 <p>To the Path of the Exalted<br> (In Might), Worthy<br> Of all praise.</p>  
 <p>7. The Unbelievers say<br> (In ridicule): "Shall we<br> Point out to you a man<br> That will tell you,<br> When ye are all scattered<br> To pieces in disintegration,<br> That ye shall (then be<br> Raised) in a New Creation?</p>  
 <p>8. "Has he invented a falsehood<br> Against God, or has<br> A spirit (seized) him?"—<br> Nay, it is those who<br> Believe not in the Hereafter,<br> That are in (real) Penalty,<br> And in farthest Error.</p>  
 <p>9. See they not what is<br> Before them and behind them,<br> Of the sky and the earth<br> If We wished, We could<br> Cause the earth to swallow<br> Them up, or cause a piece<br> Of the sky to fall upon them.<br> Verily in this is a Sign<br> For every devotee that<br> Turns to God (in repentance).</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1136"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1136</font></a></p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 2.</h5>  
 <p>10. We bestowed Grace aforetime<br> On David from Ourselves:<br> "O ye Mountains! sing ye<br> Back the Praises of God<br> With him! and ye birds<br> (Also)! And We made<br> The iron soft for him;—</p>  
 <p>11. (Commanding), "Make thou<br> Coats of mail, balancing well<br> The rings of chain armour,<br> And work ye righteousness;<br> For be sure I see<br> (Clearly) all that ye do."</p>  
 <p>12. And to Solomon (We<br> Made) the Wind (obedient):<br> Its early morning (stride)<br> Was a month's (journey),<br> And its evening (stride)<br> Was a month's (journey);<br> And We made a Font<br> Of molten brass to flow</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1137"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1137</font></a></p>  
 <p>For him; and there were<br> Jinns that worked in front<br> Of him, by the leave<br> Of his Lord, and if any<br> Of them turned aside<br> From Our command, We<br> Made him taste<br> Of the Penalty<br> Of the Blazing Fire.</p>  
 <p>13. They worked for him<br> As he desired, (making) Arches,<br> Images, Basons<br> As large as Reservoirs,<br> And (cooking) Cauldrons fixed<br> (In their places): "Work ye,<br> Sons of David, with thanks!<br> But few of My servants<br> Are grateful!"</p>  
 <p>14. Then, when We decreed<br> (Solomon's) death, nothing showed them<br> His death except a little<br> Worm of the earth, which</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1138"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1138</font></a></p>  
 <p>Kept (slowly) gnawing away<br> At his staff: so when he<br> Fell down, the Jinns saw<br> Plainly that if they had<br> Known the unseen, they<br> Would not have tarried<br> In the humiliating Penalty<br> (Of their Task).</p>  
 <p>15. There was, for Sabā,<br> Aforetime, a Sign in their<br> Home-land—two Gardens<br> To the right and to the left.<br> "Eat of the Sustenance (provided)<br> By your Lord, and be grateful<br> To Him: a territory fair and happy,<br> And a Lord Oft-Forgiving!</p>  
 <p>16. But they turned away<br> (From God), and We sent<br> Against them the flood<br> (Released) from the Dams,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1139"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1139</font></a></p>  
 <p>And We converted their two<br> Garden (rows) into "gardens"<br> Producing bitter fruit,<br> And tamarisks, and some few<br> (Stunted) Lote-trees.</p>  
 <p>17. That was the Requital<br> We gave them because<br> They ungratefully rejected Faith:<br> And never do We give<br> (Such) requital except to such<br> As are ungrateful rejecters.</p>  
 <p>18. Between them and the Cities<br> On which We had poured<br> Our blessings, We had placed<br> Cities in prominent positions,<br> And between them We had<br> Appointed stages of journey<br> In due proportion: "Travel therein,<br> Secure, by night and by day."</p>  
 <p>19. But they said: "Our Lord!<br> Place longer distances</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1140"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1140</font></a></p>  
 <p>Between our journey-stages":<br> But they wronged themselves (therein).<br> At length We made them<br> As a tale (that is told),<br> And We dispersed them<br> All in scattered fragments.<br> Verily in this are Signs<br> For every (soul that is)<br> Patiently constant and grateful.</p>  
 <p>20. And on them did Satan<br> Prove true his idea,<br> And they followed him, all<br> But a Party that believed.</p>  
 <p>21. But he had no authority<br> Over them,—except that We<br> Might test the man who<br> Believes in the Hereafter<br> From him who is in doubt<br> Concerning it: and thy Lord<br> Doth watch over all things.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1141"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1141</font></a></p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 3.</h5>  
 <p>22. Say: "Call upon other (gods)<br> Whom ye fancy, besides God:<br> They have no power,<br> Not the weight of an atom,—<br> In the heavens or on earth:<br> No (sort of) share have they<br> Therein, nor is any of them<br> A helper to God.</p>  
 <p>23. "No intercession can avail<br> In His Presence, except for those<br> For whom He has granted<br> Permission. So far (is this<br> The case) that, when terror<br> Is removed from their hearts<br> (At the Day of Judgment, then)<br> Will they say, "What is it<br> That your Lord commanded?"<br> They will say, "That which is<br> True and just; and He is<br> The Most High, Most Great."</p>  
 <p>24. Say: "Who gives you<br> Sustenance, from the heavens</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1142"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1142</font></a></p>  
 <p>And the earth?" Say:<br> "It is God; and certain it is<br> That either we or ye<br> Are on right guidance<br> Or in manifest error!"</p>  
 <p>25. Say: "Ye shall not be<br> Questioned as to our sins,<br> Nor shall we be questioned<br> As to what ye do."</p>  
 <p>26. Say: "Our Lord will gather us<br> Together and will in the end<br> Decide the matter between us<br> (And you) in truth and justice:<br> And He is the One to decide,<br> The One Who knows all."</p>  
 <p>27. Say: "Show me those whom<br> Ye have joined with Him<br> As partners: by no means<br> (Can ye). Nay, He is God,<br> The Exalted in Power,<br> The Wise."</p>  
 <p>28. We have not sent thee<br> But as a universal (Messenger)</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1143"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1143</font></a></p>  
 <p>To men, giving them<br> Glad tidings, and warning them<br> (Against sin), but most men<br> Understand not.</p>  
 <p>29. They say: "When will this<br> Promise (come to pass)<br> If ye are telling the truth?"</p>  
 <p>30. Say: "The appointment to you<br> Is for a Day, which ye<br> Cannot put back for an hour<br> Nor put forward."</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 4.</h5>  
 <p>31. The Unbelievers say:<br> "We shall neither believe<br> In this scripture nor in (any)<br> That (came) before it."<br> Couldst thou but see when<br> The wrong-doers will be made<br> To stand before their Lord,<br> Throwing back the word (of blame)</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1144"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1144</font></a></p>  
 <p>On one another! Those who<br> Had been despised will say<br> To the arrogant ones:<br> "Had it not been for you,<br> We should certainly<br> Have been believers!"</p>  
 <p>32. The arrogant ones will say<br> To those who had been despised:<br> "Was it we who kept you<br> Back from Guidance after<br> It reached you? Nay, rather,<br> It was ye who transgressed.</p>  
 <p>33. Those who had been despised<br> Will say to the arrogant ones:<br> "Nay! it was a plot<br> (Of yours) by day and by night:<br> Behold! ye (constantly) ordered us<br> To be ungrateful to God<br> And to attribute equals to Him!<br> They will declare (their) repentance<br> When they see the Penalty:<br> We shall put yokes</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1145"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1145</font></a></p>  
 <p>On the necks of the Unbelievers:<br> It would only be a requital<br> For their (ill) Deeds.</p>  
 <p>34. Never did We send<br> A Warner to a population,<br> But the wealthy ones among them<br> Said: "We believe not<br> In the (Message) with which<br> Ye have been sent."</p>  
 <p>35. They said: "We have more<br> In wealth and in sons<br> And we cannot be punished."</p>  
 <p>36. Say: "Verily my Lord enlarges<br> And restricts the Provision<br> To whom He pleases, but<br> Most men understand not."</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 5.</h5>  
 <p>37. It is not your wealth<br> Nor your sons, that will<br> Bring you nearer to Us<br> In degree: but only<br> Those who believe and work<br> Righteousness—these are<br> The ones for whom there is<br> A multiplied Reward</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1146"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1146</font></a></p>  
 <p>For their deeds, while<br> Secure they (reside)<br> In the dwellings on high!</p>  
 <p>38. Those who strive against<br> Our Signs, to frustrate them,<br> Will be given over<br> Into Punishment.</p>  
 <p>39. Say: "Verily my Lord enlarges<br> And restricts the Sustenance<br> To such of His servants<br> As He pleases: and nothing<br> Do ye spend in the least<br> (In His Cause) but He<br> Replaces it: for He is<br> The Best of those who<br> Grant Sustenance.</p>  
 <p>40. One Day He will<br> Gather them all together,<br> And say to the angels,<br> "Was it you that these<br> Men used to worship?"</p>  
 <p>41. They will say, "Glory to Thee!<br> Our (tie) is with Thee<br> As Protector—not with them.<br> Nay, but they worshipped</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1147"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1147</font></a></p>  
 <p>The Jinns: most of them<br> Believed in them."</p>  
 <p>42. So on that Day<br> No power shall they have<br> Over each other, for profit<br> Or harm: and We shall<br> Say to the wrong-doers,<br> "Taste ye the Penalty's<br> Of the Fire,—the which<br> Ye were wont to deny!"</p>  
 <p>43. When Our Clear Signs<br> Are rehearsed to them,<br> They say, "This is only<br> A man who wishes<br> To hinder you from the (worship)<br> Which your fathers practised."<br> And they say, "This is<br> Only a falsehood invented!"<br> And the Unbelievers say<br> Of the Truth when it comes<br> To them, "This is nothing<br> But evident magic!"</p>  
 <p>44. But We had not given<br> Them Books which they could<br> Study, nor sent apostles<br> To them before thee<br> As Warners.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1148"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1148</font></a></p>  
 <p>45. And their predecessors rejected<br> (The Truth); these have<br> Not received a tenth<br> Of what We had granted<br> To those: yet when they rejected<br> My apostles, how (terrible)<br> Was My rejection (of them)!</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 6.</h5>  
 <p>46. Say: "I do admonish you<br> On one point: that ye<br> Do stand up before God,—<br> (It may be) in pairs,<br> Or (it may be) singly,—<br> And reflect (within yourselves):<br> Your Companion is not<br> Possessed: he is no less<br> Than a Warner to you,<br> In face of a terrible<br> Penalty."</p>  
 <p>47. Say: "No reward do I<br> Ask of you: it is (all)<br> In your interest: my reward<br> Is only due from God:<br> And He is Witness<br> To all things."</p>  
 <p>48. Say: "Verily my Lord<br> Doth cast the (mantle</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1149"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1149</font></a></p>  
 <p>Of) Truth (over His servants),—<br> He that has full knowledge<br> Of (all) that is hidden."</p>  
 <p>49. Say: "The Truth has arrived,<br> And Falsehood neither creates<br> Anything new, nor restores<br> Anything."</p>  
 <p>50. Say: "If I am astray,<br> I only stray to the loss<br> Of my own soul: but if<br> I receive guidance, it is seen<br> Because of the inspiration<br> Of my Lord to me:<br> It is He Who hears<br> All things, and is (ever) near."</p>  
 <p>51. If thou couldst but see<br> When they will quake<br> With terror; but then<br> There will be no escape<br> (For them), and they will he<br> Seized from a position<br> (Quite) near.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1150"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1150</font></a></p>  
 <p>52. And they will say,<br> "We do believe (now)<br> In the (Truth)"; but how<br> Could they receive (Faith)<br> From a position (so) far off,—</p>  
 <p>53. Seeing that they did reject<br> Faith (entirely) before, and<br> That they (continually) cast<br> (Slanders) on the Unseen<br> From a position far off?</p>  
 <p>54. And between them<br> And their desires,<br> Is placed a barrier,<br> As was done in the past<br> With their partisans:<br> For they were indeed<br> In suspicious (disquieting) doubt.</p>
