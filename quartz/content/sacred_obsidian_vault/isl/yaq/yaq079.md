 <p><a name="page_1679"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1679</font></a></p>  <h3 align="center">Sara LXXIX.</h3>  <h3 align="center"><i>Nāzi’āt,</i> or Those Who Tear Out.</h3>  
 <p><i>In the name of God, Most Gracious,<br> Most Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>1. By the (angels)<br> Who tear out<br> (The souls of the wicked)<br> With violence;</p>  
 <p>2. By those who gently<br> Draw out (the souls<br> Of the blessed);</p>  
 <p>3. And by those who glide<br> Along (on errands of mercy),</p>  
 <p>4. Then press forward<br> As in a race,</p>  
 <p>5. Then arrange to do<br> (The Commands of their Lord),—</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1680"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1680</font></a></p>  
 <p>6. One Day everything that<br> Can be in commotion will<br> Be in violent commotion,</p>  
 <p>7. Followed by oft-repeated<br> (Commotions):</p>  
 <p>8. Hearts that Day <br> Will be in agitation;</p>  
 <p>9. Cast down will be<br> (Their owners’) eyes.</p>  
 <p>10. They say (now): "What!<br> Shall we indeed be<br> Returned to (our) former state?—</p>  
 <p>11. "What!—when we shall<br> Have become rotten bones?"</p>  
 <p>12. They say: "It would<br> In that case, be<br> A return with loss!"</p>  
 <p>13. But verily, it will<br> Be but a single</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1681"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1681</font></a></p>  
 <p>(Compelling) Cry,</p>  
 <p>14. When, behold, they<br> Will be in the (full)<br> Awakening (to Judgment).</p>  
 <p>15. Has the story<br> Of Moses reached thee?</p>  
 <p>16. Behold, thy Lord did call<br> To him in the sacred valley<br> Of Ṭuwā:—</p>  
 <p>17. "Go thou to Pharaoh,<br> For he has indeed<br> Transgressed all bounds:</p>  
 <p>18. "And say to him,<br> "Wouldst thou that thou<br> Shouldst he purified<br> (From sin)?—</p>  
 <p>19. "And that I guide thee<br> To thy Lord, so thou<br> Shouldst fear Him?"</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1682"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1682</font></a></p>  
 <p>20. Then did (Moses) show him<br> The Great Sign.</p>  
 <p>21. But (Pharaoh) rejected it<br> And disobeyed (guidance);</p>  
 <p>22. Further, he turned his back,<br> Striving hard (against God).</p>  
 <p>23. Then he collected (his men)<br> And made a proclamation,</p>  
 <p>24. Saying, "I am your Lord,<br> Most High".</p>  
 <p>25. But God did punish him,<br> (And made an) example<br> Of him,—in the Hereafter,<br> As in this life.</p>  
 <p>26. Verily in this is<br> An instructive warning<br> For whosoever feareth (God).</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 2.</h5>  
 <p>27. What! Are ye the more<br> Difficult to create<br> Or the heaven (above)?<br> (God) hath constructed it:</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1683"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1683</font></a></p>  
 <p>28. On high hath He raised<br> Its canopy, and He hath<br> Given it order and perfection.</p>  
 <p>29. Its night doth He<br> Endow with darkness,<br> And its splendour doth He<br> Bring out (with light).</p>  
 <p>30. And the earth, moreover,<br> Hath He extended<br> (To a wide expanse);</p>  
 <p>31. He draweth out<br> Therefrom its moisture<br> And its pasture;</p>  
 <p>32. And the mountains<br> Hath He firmly fixed;</p>  
 <p>33. For use and convenience<br> To you and your cattle.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1684"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1684</font></a></p>  
 <p>34. Therefore, when there comes<br> The great, overwhelming (Event),—</p>  
 <p>35. The Day when Man<br> Shall remember (all)<br> That he strove for,</p>  
 <p>36. And Hell-Fire shall be<br> Placed in full view<br> For (all) to see,—</p>  
 <p>37. Then, for such as had<br> Transgressed all bounds,</p>  
 <p>38. And had preferred<br> The life of this world,</p>  
 <p>39. The Abode will be<br> Hell-Fire;</p>  
 <p>40. And for such as had<br> Entertained the fear<br> Of standing before<br> Their Lord's (tribunal)<br> And had restrained<br> (Their) soul from lower Desires,</p>  
 <p>41. Their Abode will be<br> The Garden.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1685"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1685</font></a></p>  
 <p>42. They ask thee<br> About the Hour,—"When<br> Will be its appointed time?"</p>  
 <p>43. Wherein art thou (concerned)<br> With the declaration thereof?</p>  
 <p>44. With thy Lord is<br> The Limit fixed therefor.</p>  
 <p>45. Thou art but a Warner<br> For such as fear it.</p>  
 <p>46. The Day they see it,<br> (It will be) as if they<br> Had tarried but a single<br> Evening, or (at most till)<br> The following morn!</p>
