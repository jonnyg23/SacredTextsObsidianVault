 <p><a name="page_1576"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1576</font></a></p>  <h3 align="center">Sūra LXVII.</h3>  <h3 align="center"><i>Mulk,</i> or Dominion.</h3>  
 <p><i>In the name of God, Most Gracious,<br> Most Merciful.</i></p>  
 <p>1. Blessed be He<br> In Whose hands<br> Is Dominion;<br> And He over all things<br> Hath Power;—</p>  
 <p>2. He Who created Death<br> And Life, that He<br> May try which of you<br> Is best in deed:<br> And He is the Exalted<br> In Might, Oft-Forgiving;—</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1577"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1577</font></a></p>  
 <p>3. He Who created<br> The seven heavens<br> One above another:<br> No want of proportion<br> Wilt thou see<br> In the Creation<br> Of (God) Most Gracious.<br> So turn thy vision again:<br> Seest thou any flaw?</p>  
 <p>4. Again turn thy vision<br> A second time: (thy) vision<br> Will come back to thee<br> Dull and discomfited,<br> In a state worn out.</p>  
 <p>5. And We have,<br> (From of old),<br> Adorned the lowest heaven<br> With Lamps, and We<br> Have made such (Lamps)<br> (As) missiles to drive<br> Away the Evil Ones,<br> And have prepared for them<br> The Penalty<br> Of the Blazing Fire.</p>  
 <p>6. For those who reject<br> Their Lord (and Cherisher)</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1578"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1578</font></a></p>  
 <p>Is the Penalty of Hell:<br> And evil is (such) destination.</p>  
 <p>7. When they are cast therein,<br> They will hear<br> The (terrible) drawing in<br> Of its breath<br> Even as it blazes forth,</p>  
 <p>8. Almost bursting with fury:<br> Every time a Group<br> Is cast therein, its Keepers<br> Will ask, "Did no Warner<br> Come to you?"</p>  
 <p>9. They will say: "Yes indeed;<br> A Warner did come to us,<br> But we rejected him<br> And said, "God never<br> Sent down any (Message):<br> Ye are innothing but<br> An egregious delusion!"</p>  
 <p>10. They will further say:<br> "Had we but listened<br> Or used our intelligence,<br> We should not (now)</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1579"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1579</font></a></p>  
 <p>Be among the Companions<br> Of the Blazing Fire!"</p>  
 <p>11. They will then confess<br> Their sins: but far<br> Will be (Forgiveness)<br> From the Companions<br> Of the Blazing Fire!</p>  
 <p>12. As for those who<br> Fear their Lord unseen,<br> For them is Forgiveness<br> And a great Reward.</p>  
 <p>13. And whether ye hide<br> Your word or publish it,<br> He certainly has (full) knowledge,<br> Of the secrets of (all) hearts.</p>  
 <p>14. Should He not know,—<br> He that created?<br> And He is the One<br> That understands the finest<br> Mysteries (and) is<br> Well-acquainted (with them).</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 2.</h5>  
 <p>15. It is He Who has<br> Made the earth manageable</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1580"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1580</font></a></p>  
 <p>For you, so traverse<br> Ye through its tracts<br> And enjoy of the Sustenance<br> Which He furnishes: but<br> Unto Him is the Resurrection.</p>  
 <p>16. Do ye feel secure that<br> He Who is in Heaven<br> Will not cause you<br> To be swallowed up<br> By the earth when it<br> Shakes (as in an earthquake)?</p>  
 <p>17. Or do ye feel secure<br> That He Who is in Heaven<br> Will not send against you<br> A violent tornado<br> (With showers of stones),<br> So that ye shall<br> Know how (terrible)<br> Was My warning?</p>  
 <p>18. But indeed men before them<br> Rejected (My warning):<br> Then how (terrible) was<br> My rejection (of them)?</p>  
 <p>19. Do they not observe<br> The birds above them,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1581"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1581</font></a></p>  
 <p>Spreading their wings<br> And folding them in?<br> None can uphold them<br> Except (God) Most Gracious:<br> Truly it is He<br> That watches over all things.</p>  
 <p>20. Nay, who is there<br> That can help you,<br> (Even as) an army,<br> Besides (God) Most Merciful?<br> In nothing but delusion<br> Are the Unbelievers.</p>  
 <p>21. Or who is there<br> That can provide you<br> With Sustenance if He<br> Were to withhold His provision?<br> Nay, they obstinately persist<br> In insolent impiety<br> And flight (from the Truth).</p>  
 <p>22. Is then one who<br> Walks headlong, with his face<br> Grovelling, better guided,—<br> Or one who walks<br> Evenly on a Straight Way?</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1582"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1582</font></a></p>  
 <p>23. Say: "It is He Who<br> Has created you (and made<br> You grow), and made<br> For you the faculties<br> Of hearing, seeing,<br> Feeling and understanding:<br> Little thanks it is ye give.</p>  
 <p>24. Say: "It is He Who<br> Has multiplied you<br> Through the earth,<br> And to Him shall ye<br> Be gathered together."</p>  
 <p>25. They ask: When will<br> This promise be (fulfilled)?—<br> If ye are telling<br> The truth.</p>  
 <p>26. Say: "As to the knowledge<br> Of the time, it is<br> With God alone:<br> I am (sent) only<br> To warn plainly in public."</p>  
 <p>27. At length, when they<br> See it close at hand,<br> Grieved will be the faces<br> Of the Unbelievers,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1583"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1583</font></a></p>  
 <p>And it will be said<br> (To them): "This is<br> (The promise fulfilled),<br> Which ye were calling for!"</p>  
 <p>28. Say: "See ye?—<br> If God were<br> To destroy me,<br> And those with me,<br> Or if He bestows<br> His Mercy on us,—<br> Yet who can deliver<br> The Unbelievers from<br> A grievous Penalty?"</p>  
 <p>29. Say: "He is (God)<br> Most Gracious: we have<br> Believed in Him,<br> And on Him have we<br> Put our trust:<br> So, soon will ye know<br> Which (of us) it is<br> That is in manifest error."</p>  
 <p>30. Say: "See ye?—<br> If your stream be<br> Some morning lost<br> (In the underground earth),<br> Who then can supply you<br> With clear-flowing water?"</p>
