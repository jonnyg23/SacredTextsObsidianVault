 <p align="center">MECCA.--44 Verses</p>  
 <p>In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful<br> A SUITOR sued <a name="fr_157"></a><a href="#fn_157"><font size="1">1</font></a> for punishment to light suddenly<br> On the infidels: none can hinder<br> God from inflicting it, the master of those ASCENTS,<br> By which the angels and the spirit ascend to him in a day, whose length is fifty thousand years. <a name="fr_158"></a><a href="#fn_158"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> Be thou patient therefore with becoming patience;<br> They forsooth regard that day as distant,<br> But we see it nigh:<br> The day when the heavens shall become as molten brass,<br> And the mountains shall become like flocks of wool:<br> And friend shall not question of friend,<br> Though they look at one another. Fain would the wicked redeem himself from punishment on that day at the price of his children,<br> Of his spouse and his brother,<br> And of his kindred who shewed affection for him,<br> And of all who are on the earth that then it might deliver him.<br> But no. For the fire,<br> Dragging by the scalp,<br> Shall claim him who turned his back and went away,<br> And amassed and hoarded.<br> Man truly is by creation hasty;<br> When evil befalleth him, impatient;<br> But when good falleth to his lot, tenacious.<br> Not so the prayerful,<br> Who are ever constant at their prayers;<br> And of whose substance there is a due and stated portion<br> For him who asketh, and for him who is ashamed <a name="fr_159"></a><a href="#fn_159"><font size="1">3</font></a> to beg;<br> And who own the judgment-day a truth,<br> And who thrill with dread at the chastisement of their Lord--<br> For there is none safe from the chastisement of their Lord--<br> And who control their desires,<br> (Save with their wives or the slaves whom their right hands have won, for there they shall be blameless;<br> But whoever indulge their desires beyond this are transgressors);<br> And who are true to their trusts and their engagements,<br> And who witness uprightly,<br> And who keep strictly the hours of prayer:<br> These shall dwell, laden with honours, amid gardens.<br> But what hath come to the unbelievers that they run at full stretch around thee,<br> On the right hand and on the left, in bands?<br> Is it that every man of them would fain enter that garden of delights?<br> Not at all. We have created them, they know of what.<br> It needs not that I swear by the Lord of the East and of the West <a name="fr_160"></a><a href="#fn_160"><font size="1">4</font></a> that we have power.<br> To replace them with better than themselves: neither are we to be hindered.<br> Wherefore let them flounder on and disport them, till they come face to face with their threatened day,<br> The day on which they shall flock up out of their graves in haste like men who rally to a standard:--<br> Their eyes downcast; disgrace shall cover them. Such their threatened day.</p>
