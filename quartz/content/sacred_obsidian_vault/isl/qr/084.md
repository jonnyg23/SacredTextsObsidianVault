 <p align="center">MECCA.--25 Verses</p>  
 <p>In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful<br> WHEN the Heaven shall have SPLIT ASUNDER<br> And duteously obeyed its Lord; <a name="fr_88"></a><a href="#fn_88"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> And when Earth shall have been stretched out as a plain,<br> And shall have cast forth what was in her and become empty,<br> And duteously obeyed its Lord;<br> Then verily, O man, who desirest to reach thy Lord, shalt thou meet him.<br> And he into whose right hand his Book shall be given,<br> Shall be reckoned with in an easy reckoning,<br> And shall turn, rejoicing, to his kindred.<br> But he whose Book shall be given him behind his back <a name="fr_89"></a><a href="#fn_89"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> Shall invoke destruction:<br> But in the fire shall he burn,<br> For that he lived joyously among his kindred,<br> Without a thought that he should return to God.<br> Yea, but his Lord beheld him.<br> It needs not therefore that I swear by the sunset redness,<br> And by the night and its gatherings,<br> And by the moon when at her full,<br> That from state to state shall ye be surely carried onward. <a name="fr_90"></a><a href="#fn_90"><font size="1">3</font></a><br> What then hath come to them that they believe not?<br> And that when the Koran is recited to them they adore not?<br> Yea, the unbelievers treat it as a lie.<br> But God knoweth their secret hatreds:<br> Let their only tidings <a name="fr_91"></a><a href="#fn_91"><font size="1">4</font></a> be those of painful punishment;<br> Save to those who believe and do the things that be right.<br> An unfailing recompense shall be theirs.</p>
