 <p align="center">MECCA.--78 Verses</p>  
 <p>In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful<br> The God of MERCY hath taught the Koran,<br> Hath created man,<br> Hath taught him articulate speech,<br> The Sun and the Moon have each their times,<br> And the plants and the trees bend in adoration.<br> And the Heaven, He hath reared it on high, and hath appointed the balance;<br> That in the balance ye should not transgress.<br> Weigh therefore with fairness, and scant not the balance.<br> And the Earth, He hath prepared it for the living tribes:<br> Therein are fruits, and the palms with sheathed clusters,<br> And the grain with its husk, and the fragrant plants.<br> Which then of the bounties of your Lord will ye twain <a name="fr_161"></a><a href="#fn_161"><font size="1">1</font></a> deny?<br> He created man of clay like that of the potter.<br> And He created the djinn of pure fire:<br> Which then of the bounties, etc.<br> He is the Lord of the East, <a name="fr_162"></a><a href="#fn_162"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> He is the Lord of the West:<br> Which, etc.<br> He hath let loose the two seas <a name="fr_163"></a><a href="#fn_163"><font size="1">3</font></a> which meet each other:<br> Yet between them is a barrier which they overpass not:<br> Which, etc.<br> From each he bringeth up pearls both great and small:<br> Which, etc.<br> And His are the ships towering up at sea like mountains:<br> Which, etc.<br> All on the earth shall pass away,<br> But the face of thy Lord shall abide resplendent with majesty and glory:<br> Which, etc.<br> To Him maketh suit all that is in the Heaven and the Earth. Every day doth some new work employ Him:<br> Which, etc.<br> We will find leisure to judge you, O ye men and djinn: <a name="fr_164"></a><a href="#fn_164"><font size="1">4</font></a><br> Which, etc.<br> O company of djinn and men, if ye can overpass the bounds of the Heavens and the Earth, then overpass them. But by our leave only shall ye overpass them:<br> Which, etc.<br> A bright flash of fire shall be hurled at you both, and molten brass, and ye shall not defend yourselves from it:<br> Which, etc.<br> When the Heaven shall be cleft asunder, and become rose red, like stained leather:<br> Which, etc.<br> On that day shall neither man nor djinn be asked of his sin:<br> Which, etc.<br> By their tokens shall the sinners be known, and they shall be seized by their forelocks and their feet:<br> Which, etc.<br> "This is Hell which sinners treated as a lie."<br> To and fro shall they pass between it and the boiling water:<br> Which, etc.<br> But for those who dread the majesty of their Lord shall be two gardens:<br> Which, etc.<br> With o'erbranching trees in each:<br> Which, etc.<br> In each two kinds of every fruit:<br> Which, etc.<br> On couches with linings of brocade shall they recline, and the fruit of the two gardens shall be within easy reach:<br> Which, etc.<br> Therein shall be the damsels with retiring glances, whom nor man nor djinn hath touched before them:<br> Which, etc.<br> Like jacynths and pearls:<br> Which, etc.<br> Shall the reward of good be aught but good?<br> Which, etc.<br> And beside these shall be two other gardens: <a name="fr_165"></a><a href="#fn_165"><font size="1">5</font></a><br> Which, etc.<br> Of a dark green:<br> Which, etc.<br> With gushing fountains in each:<br> Which, etc.<br> In each, fruits and the palm and the pomegranate:<br> Which, etc.<br> In each, the fair, the beauteous ones:<br> Which, etc.<br> With large dark eyeballs, kept close in their pavilions:<br> Which, etc.<br> Whom man hath never touched, nor any djinn: <a name="fr_166"></a><a href="#fn_166"><font size="1">6</font></a><br> Which, etc.<br> Their spouses on soft green cushions and on beautiful carpets shall recline:<br> Which, etc.<br> Blessed be the name of thy Lord, full of majesty and glory.</p>

Suras ii. 23 and iv. 60. While in Suras xxxvi. 56; xliii. 70; xiii. 23; xl. 8 the proper wives of the faithful are spoken of as accompanying their husbands into the gardens of bliss.</p>
