 <p align="center">MECCA.--52 Verses</p>  
 <p>In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful<br> The INEVITABLE!<br> And who shall make thee comprehend what the Inevitable is?<br> Themoud and Ad treated the day of Terrors <a name="fr_113"></a><a href="#fn_113"><font size="1">1</font></a> as a lie.<br> So as to Themoud, <a name="fr_114"></a><a href="#fn_114"><font size="1">2</font></a> they were destroyed by crashing thunder bolts;<br> And as to Ad, they were destroyed by a roaring and furious blast.<br> It did the bidding of God <a name="fr_115"></a><a href="#fn_115"><font size="1">3</font></a> against them seven nights and eight days together, during which thou mightest have seen the people laid low, as though they had been the trunks of hollow palms;<br> And couldst thou have seen one of them surviving?<br> Pharaoh also, and those who flourished before him, and the overthrown cities, committed sin,--<br> And disobeyed the Sent one of their Lord; therefore did he chastise them with an accumulated chastisement.<br> When the Flood rose high, we bare you in the Ark,<br> That we might make that event a warning to you, and that the retaining ear might retain it.<br> But when one blast shall be blown on the trumpet,<br> And the earth and the mountains shall be upheaved, and shall both be crushed into dust at a single crushing,<br> On that day the woe that must come suddenly shall suddenly come, <a name="fr_116"></a><a href="#fn_116"><font size="1">4</font></a><br> And the heaven shall cleave asunder, for on that day it shall be fragile;<br> And the angels shall be on its sides, and over them on that day eight shall bear up the throne of thy Lord.<br> On that day ye shall be brought before Him: none of your hidden deeds shall remain hidden:<br> And he who shall have his book given to him in his right hand, will say to his friends, "Take ye it; read ye my book;<br> I ever thought that to this my reckoning I should come."<br> And his shall be a life that shall please him well,<br> In a lofty garden,<br> Whose clusters shall be near at hand:<br> "Eat ye and drink with healthy relish, as the meed of what ye sent on beforehand in the days which are past."<br> But he who shall have his book given into his left hand, will say, "O that my book had never been given me!<br> And that I had never known my reckoning!<br> O that death had made an end of me!<br> My wealth hath not profited me!<br> My power hath perished from me!"<br> "Lay ye hold on him and chain him,<br> Then at the Hell-fire burn him,<br> Then into a chain whose length is seventy cubits thrust him;<br> For he believed not in God, the Great,<br> And was not careful to feed the poor;<br> No friend therefore shall he have here this day,<br> Nor food, but corrupt sores,<br> Which none shall eat but the sinners."<br> It needs not that I swear by what ye see,<br> And by that which ye see not,<br> That this verily is the word of an apostle worthy of all honour!<br> And that it is not the word of a poet--how little do ye believe!<br> Neither is it the word of a soothsayer (Kahin)--how little do ye receive warning!<br> It is a missive from the Lord of the worlds.<br> But if Muhammad had fabricated concerning us any sayings,<br> We had surely seized him by the right hand,<br> And had cut through the vein of his neck. <a name="fr_117"></a><a href="#fn_117"><font size="1">5</font></a><br> Nor would We have withheld any one of you from him.<br> But, verily, It (the Koran) is a warning for the God-fearing;<br> And we well know that there are of you who treat it as a falsehood.<br> But it shall be the despair of infidels,<br> For it is the very truth of sure knowledge.<br> Praise, then, the name of thy Lord, the Great.</p>
