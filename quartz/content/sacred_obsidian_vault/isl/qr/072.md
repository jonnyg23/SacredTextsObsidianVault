 <p align="center">MECCA.--28 Verses</p>  
 <p>In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful<br> SAY: It hath been revealed to me that a company of<br> DJINN <a name="fr_382"></a><a href="#fn_382"><font size="1">1</font></a> listened, and said,--"Verily, we have heard a marvellous discourse (Koran);<br> It guideth to the truth; wherefore we believed in it, and we will not henceforth join any being with our Lord;<br> And He,--may the majesty of our Lord be exalted!--hath taken no spouse neither hath he any offspring.<br> But the foolish among us hath spoken of God that which is unjust:<br> And we verily thought that no one amongst men or Djinn would have uttered a lie against God.<br> There are indeed people among men, who have sought for refuge unto people among Djinn: but they only increased their folly:<br> And they thought, as ye think, that God would not raise any from the dead.<br> And the Heavens did we essay, but found them filled with a mighty garrison, and with flaming darts;<br> And we sat on some of the seats to listen, but whoever listeneth findeth an ambush ready for him of flaming darts.<br> And truly we know not whether evil be meant for them that are on earth, or whether their Lord meaneth guidance for them.<br> And there are among us good, and others among us of another kind;--we are of various sorts:<br> And verily we thought that no one could weaken God on earth, neither could we escape from him by flight:<br> Wherefore as soon as we had heard 'the guidance' we believed in it; and whoever believeth in his Lord, need not fear either loss or wrong.<br> There are some among us who have resigned themselves to God (the Muslims); and there are others of us who have gone astray. And whoso resigneth himself to God pursueth the way of truth;<br> But they who go astray from it shall be fuel for Hell."<br> Moreover, if they (the Meccans) keep straight on in that way, we will surely give them to drink of abundant waters,<br> That we may prove them thereby: but whoso withdraweth from the remembrance of his Lord, him will He send into a severe torment.<br> It is unto God that the temples are set apart: call not then on any other therein with God.<br> When the servant of God stood up to call upon Him, the djinn almost jostled him by their crowds.<br> SAY: I call only upon my Lord, and I join no other being with Him.<br> SAY: No control have I over what may hurt or benefit you.<br> SAY: Verily none can protect me against God;<br> Neither shall I find any refuge beside Him.<br> My sole work is preaching from God, and His message: and for such as shall rebel against God and his apostle is the fire of Hell! they shall remain therein alway,--for ever!<br> Until they see their threatened vengeance they will be perverse! but then shall they know which side was the weakest in a protector and the fewest in number.<br> SAY: I know not whether that with which ye are threatened be nigh, or whether my Lord hath assigned it to a distant day: He knoweth the secret, nor doth He divulge his secret to any,<br> Except to that Apostle who pleaseth Him; and before him and behind him He maketh a guard to march:<br> That He may know if his Apostles have verily delivered the messages of their Lord: and He embraceth in his knowledge all their ways, and taketh count of all that concerneth them.</p>
