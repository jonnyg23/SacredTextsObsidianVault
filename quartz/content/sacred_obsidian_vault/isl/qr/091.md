 <p>In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful<br> BY the SUN and his noonday brightness!<br> By the Moon when she followeth him!<br> By the Day when it revealeth his glory!<br> By the Night when it enshroudeth him!<br> By the Heaven and Him who built it!<br> By the Earth and Him who spread it forth!<br> By a Soul and Him who balanced it,<br> And breathed into it its wickedness and its piety,<br> Blessed now is he who hath kept it pure,<br> And undone is he who hath corrupted it!<br> Themoud <a name="fr_64"></a><a href="#fn_64"><font size="1">1</font></a> in his impiety rejected the message of the Lord,<br> When the greatest wretch among them rushed up:--<br> Said the Apostle of God to them,--"The Camel of God! let her drink."<br> But they treated him as an impostor and hamstrung her.<br> So their Lord destroyed them for their crime, and visited all alike:<br> Nor feared he the issue.</p>
