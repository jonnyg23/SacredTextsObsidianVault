 <p align="center">MECCAe.--60 Verses</p>  
 <p>In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful<br> By the clouds <a name="fr_118"></a><a href="#fn_118"><font size="1">1</font></a> which scatter with SCATTERING,<br> And those which bear their load,<br> And by those which speed lightly along,<br> And those which apportion by command!<br> True, indeed, is that with which ye are threatened,<br> And lo! the judgment will surely come. <a name="fr_119"></a><a href="#fn_119"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> By the star-tracked heaven!<br> Ye are discordant in what ye say;<br> But whose turneth him from the truth, is turned from it by a divine decree.<br> Perish the liars,<br> Who are bewildered in the depths of ignorance!<br> They ask, "When this day of judgment?"<br> On that day they shall be tormented at the fire.<br> "Taste ye of this your torment, whose speedy coming ye challenged."<br> But the God-fearing shall dwell amid gardens and fountains,<br> Enjoying what their Lord hath given them, because, aforetime they were well- doers:<br> But little of the night was it that they slept,<br> And at dawn they prayed for pardon,<br> And gave due share of their wealth to the suppliant and the outcast.<br> On Earth are signs for men of firm belief,<br> And also in your own selves: Will ye not then behold them?<br> The Heaven hath sustenance for you, and it containeth that which you are promised.<br> By the Lord then of the heaven and of the earth, I swear that this is the truth, even as ye speak yourselves. <a name="fr_120"></a><a href="#fn_120"><font size="1">3</font></a><br> Hath the story reached thee of Abraham's honoured guests? <a name="fr_121"></a><a href="#fn_121"><font size="1">4</font></a><br> When they went in unto him and said, "Peace!" he replied, "Peace:--they are strangers."<br> And he went apart to his family, and brought a fatted calf,<br> And set it before them. He said, "Eat ye not?"<br> And he conceived a fear of them. They said to him, "Fear not;" and announced to him a wise son.<br> His wife came up with outcry: she smote her face and said, "What I, old and barren!"<br> They said, "Thus saith thy Lord. He truly is the Wise, the Knowing."<br> Said he, "And what, O messengers, is your errand?"<br> They said, "To a wicked people are we sent,<br> To hurl upon them stones of clay,<br> Destined <a name="fr_122"></a><a href="#fn_122"><font size="1">5</font></a> by thy Lord for men guilty of excesses."<br> And we brought forth the believers who were in the city:<br> But we found not in it but one family of Muslims.<br> And signs we left in it for those who dread the afflictive chastisement,--<br> And in Moses: when we sent him to Pharaoh with manifest power:<br> But relying on his forces <a name="fr_123"></a><a href="#fn_123"><font size="1">6</font></a> he turned his back and said, "Sorcerer, or Possessed."<br> So we seized him and his hosts and cast them into the sea; for of all blame was he worthy.<br> And in Ad: when we sent against them the desolating blast:<br> It touched not aught over which it came, but it turned it to dust.<br> And in Themoud: <a name="fr_124"></a><a href="#fn_124"><font size="1">7</font></a> when it was said to them, "Enjoy yourselves for yet a while."<br> But they rebelled against their Lord's command: so the tempest took them as they watched its coming. <a name="fr_125"></a><a href="#fn_125"><font size="1">8</font></a><br> They were not able to stand upright, and could not help themselves.<br> And we destroyed the people of Noah, before them; for an impious people were they.<br> And the Heaven--with our hands have we built it up, and given it its expanse;<br> And the Earth--we have stretched it out like a carpet; and how<br> smoothly have we spread it forth!<br> And of everything have we created pairs: that haply ye may reflect.<br> Fly then to God: I come to you from him a plain warner.<br> And set not up another god with God: I come to you from him a plain warner.<br> Even thus came there no apostle to those who flourished before them, but they exclaimed, "Sorcerer, or Possessed."<br> Have they made a legacy to one another of this scoff? Yes, they are a rebel people.<br> Turn away, then, from them, and thou shalt not incur reproach:<br> Yet warn them, for, in truth, warning will profit the believers.<br> I have not created Djinn and men, but that they should worship me:<br> I require not sustenance from them, neither require I that they feed me:<br> Verily, God is the sole sustainer: possessed of might: the unshaken!<br> Therefore to those who injure thee shall be a fate like the fate of<br> their fellows of old. Let them not challenge me to hasten it.<br> Woe then to the infidels, because of their threatened day.</p>

 <h3 align="CENTER">Footnotes</h3>
 <p><a name="fn_118"></a><a href="051.htm#fr_118">1</a> Lit. (I swear) by those which scatter (i.e., the rain) with a scattering, (2) and by those which carry a burden, (3) and by those which run lightly, (4) and by those which divide a matter, or by command. The participles are all in the feminine: hence some interpret verse 1 of winds; verse 2 of clouds; verse 3 of ships; verse 4 of angels.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_119"></a><a href="051.htm#fr_119">2</a> Comp. note at Sura lvi. 1, p. 65.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_120"></a><a href="051.htm#fr_120">3</a> That is, this oath is for the confirmation of the truth, as ye are wont to confirm things one among another by an oath.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_121"></a><a href="051.htm#fr_121">4</a> Comp. Sura xi. 72, and xv. 51. From the want of connection with what precedes, it is highly probable that the whole passage from verse 24 60 did not originally form a part of this Sura, but was added at a later period, perhaps in the recension of the text under Othman.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_122"></a><a href="051.htm#fr_122">5</a> Lit. marked, with the names of the individuals to be slain, say the commentators.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_123"></a><a href="051.htm#fr_123">6</a> Or, with his nobles.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_124"></a><a href="051.htm#fr_124">7</a> For Ad and Themoud, see Sura xi.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_125"></a><a href="051.htm#fr_125">8</a> That is, in broad daylight. Thus Beidh. Comp. Sura xlvi. 22.</p>
