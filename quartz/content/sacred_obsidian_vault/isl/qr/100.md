 <p align="center">Mecca.--11 Verses</p>  
 <p>In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful<br> By the snorting CHARGERS!<br> And those that dash off sparks of fire!<br> And those that scour to the attack at morn!<br> And stir therein the dust aloft;<br> And cleave therein their midway through a host!<br> Truly, Man is to his Lord ungrateful.<br> And of this he is himself a witness;<br> And truly, he is vehement in the love of this world's good.<br> Ah! knoweth he not, that when that which is in the graves shall be laid bare,<br> And that which is in men's breasts shall be brought forth,<br> Verily their Lord shall on that day be informed concerning them?</p>
