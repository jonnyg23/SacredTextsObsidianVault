 <p align="center"><i>Showing that when the Self is strengthened by Love it gains dominion over the outward and inward forces of the universe</i>.</p>  
 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">When</span> the Self is made strong by Love<br> Its power rules the whole world.<br> The Heavenly Sage who adorned the sky with stars <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">485</font></span><br> Plucked these buds from the bough of the Self.<br> Its hand becomes God's hand,<br> The moon is split by its fingers.<br> It is the arbitrator in all the quarrels of the world,<br> Its command is obeyed by Darius and Jamshíd. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">490</font></span></p>

 <p>I will tell thee a story of Bú Ali, <a name="fr_51"></a><a href="#fn_51"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> Whose name is renowned in India,<br> Him who sang of the ancient rose-garden<br> And discoursed to us about the lovely rose:<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">495</font></span> The air of his fluttering skirt<br> Made a Paradise of this fire-born country.<br> His young disciple went one day to the bazaar<br> The wine of Bú Ali's discourse had turned his head.<br> The governor of the city was coming along on horseback,<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">500</font></span> His servant and staff-bearer rode beside him.<br> The forerunner shouted, "O senseless one,<br> Do not get in the way of the governor's escort!"</p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_45"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 45</font></a></p>  
 <p>But the dervish walked on with drooping head,<br> Sunk in the sea of his own thoughts.<br> The staff-bearer, drunken with pride, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">505</font></span><br> Broke his staff on the head of the dervish,<br> Who stepped painfully out of the governor's way,<br> Sad and sorry, with a heavy heart.<br> He came to Bú Ali and complained<br> And released the tears from his eyes. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">510</font></span><br> Like lightning that falls on mountains,<br> The Sheikh poured forth a fiery torrent of speech.<br> He let loose from his soul a strange fire,<br> He gave an order to his secretary:<br> Take thy pen and write a letter <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">515</font></span><br> From a dervish to a sultan!<br> Say, 'Thy governor has broken my servant's head;<br> He has cast burning coals on his own life.</p>

 <p>Arrest this wicked governor,<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">520</font></span> Or else I will bestow thy kingdom on another.'"<br> The letter of the saint who had access to God<br> Caused the monarch to tremble in every limb.<br> His body was filled with aches,<br> He grew as pale as the evening sun.<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">525</font></span> He sought out a handcuff for the governor<br> And entreated Bú Ali to pardon this offence.<br> Khusrau, the sweet-voiced eloquent poet, <a name="fr_52"></a><a href="#fn_52"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> Whose harmonies flow from the creative mind<br> And whose genius hath the soft brilliance of moonlight,<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">530</font></span> Was chosen to be the king's ambassador.</p>

 <p>When he entered Bú Ali's presence and played his lute,<br> His song melted the fakir's soul like glass.<br> One strain of poesy bought the grace<br> Of a majesty that was firm as a mountain.<br> Do not wound the hearts of dervishes, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">535</font></span><br> Do not throw thyself into burning fire!</p>
