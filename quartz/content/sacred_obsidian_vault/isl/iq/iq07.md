 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">435</font></span> <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">O thou</span> who hast gathered taxes from lions,<br> Thy need hath caused thee to become a fox in disposition.<br> Thy maladies are the result of indigence:<br> This disease is the source of thy pain.<br> It is robbing thine high thoughts of their dignity<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">440</font></span> And putting out the light of thy noble imagination.<br> Quaff rosy wine from the jar of existence!</p>  
 <p><a name="page_39"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 39</font></a></p>  
 <p>Snatch thy money from the purse of Time!<br> Like Omar, come down from thy camel! <a name="fr_48"></a><a href="#fn_48"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> Beware of incurring obligations, beware!<br> How long wilt thou sue for office <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">445</font></span><br> And ride like children on a woman's back?<br> A nature that fixes its gaze on the sky<br> Becomes debased by receiving benefits.<br> By asking, poverty is made more abject;<br> By begging, the beggar is made poorer. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">450</font></span><br> Asking disintegrates the Self<br> And deprives of illumination the Sinai-bush of the Self.<br> Do not scatter thy handful of dust;<br> Like the moon, scrape food from thine own side!<br> Albeit thou art poor and wretched <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">455</font></span></p>

 <p>And overwhelmed by affliction,<br> Seek not thy daily bread from the bounty of another,<br> Seek not waves of water from the fountain of the sun,<br> Lest thou be put to shame before the Prophet<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">460</font></span> On the Day when every soul shall be stricken with fear.<br> The moon gets sustenance from the table of the sun<br> And bears the brand of his bounty on her heart.<br> Pray God for courage! Wrestle with Fortune!<br> Do not sully the honour of the pure religion!<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">465</font></span> He who swept the rubbish of idols out of the Kaba<br> Said that God loves a man that earns his living.<br> Woe to him that accepts bounty from another's table</p>  
 <p><a name="page_41"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 41</font></a></p>  
 <p>And lets his neck be bent with benefits!<br> He hath consumed himself with the lightning of the favours bestowed on him,<br> He hath sold his honour for a paltry coin. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">470</font></span><br> Happy the man who thirsting in the sun<br> Does not crave of Khizr a cup of water! <a name="fr_49"></a><a href="#fn_49"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> His brow is not moist with the shame of beggary;<br> He is a man still, not a piece of clay.<br> That noble youth walks under heaven <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">475</font></span><br> With his head erect like the pine.<br> Are his hands empty? The more is he master of himself.<br> Do his fortunes languish? The more alert is he.<br> The beggar's wallet is like a boat tossing in waves of fire;</p>

 <p>Sweet is a little dew gathered by <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">480</font></span> one's own hand.<br> Be a man of honour, and like the bubble<br> Keep thy cup inverted even in the midst of the sea! <a name="fr_50"></a><a href="#fn_50"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>
