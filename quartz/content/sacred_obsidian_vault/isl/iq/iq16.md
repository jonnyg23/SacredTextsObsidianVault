 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Now</span> I will open one more gate of Truth,<br> I will tell thee another tale.<br> The coal in the mine said to the diamond,<br> "O thou entrusted with splendours everlasting,<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1195</font></span> We are comrades, and our being is one;<br> The source of our existence is the same,<br> Yet while I die here in the anguish of worthlessness,<br> Thou art set on the crowns of emperors.</p>

 <p>My stuff is so vile that I am valued less than earth,<br> Whereas the mirror's heart is rent by thy beauty. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1200</font></span><br> My darkness illumines the chafing-dish,<br> Then my substance is incinerated at last.<br> Every one puts the sole of his foot on my head<br> And covers my stock of existence with ashes.<br> My fate must needs be deplored; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1205</font></span><br> Dost thou know what is the gist of my being?<br> Thou art a condensed wavelet of smoke,<br> Endowed with the properties of a single spark;<br> Both in feature and nature thou art star-like,<br> Splendours rise from every side of thee. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1210</font></span><br> Now thou becomst the light of a monarch's eye,</p>

 <p>Now thou adornest the haft of a dagger."<br> "O sagacious friend!" said the diamond,<br> Dark earth, when hardened, becomes in dignity as a bezel.<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1215</font></span> Having been at strife with its environment,<br> It is ripened by the struggle and grows hard like a stone.<br> Tis this ripeness that has endowed my form with light<br> And filled my bosom with radiance.<br> Because thy being is immature, thou hast become abased;<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1220</font></span> Because thy body is soft, thou art burnt.<br> Be void of fear, grief, and anxiety;<br> Be hard as a stone, be a diamond!<br> Whosoever strives hard and grips tight,<br> The two worlds are illumined by him.<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1225</font></span> A little earth is the origin of the Black Stone</p>

 <p>Which puts forth its head in the Kaba:<br> Its rank is higher than Sinai,<br> It is kissed by the swarthy and the fair.<br> In solidity consists the glory of Life;<br> Weakness is worthlessness and immaturity." <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1230</font></span></p>
