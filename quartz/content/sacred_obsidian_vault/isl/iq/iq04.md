 <p align="center"><i>Showing that the system of the universe originates in the Self, and that the continuation of the life of all individuals depends on strengthening the Self</i>.</p>  
 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The</span> form of existence is an effect of the Self,<br> Whatsoever thou seest is a secret of the Self.<br> When the Self awoke to consciousness,<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">190</font></span> It revealed the universe of Thought.<br> A hundred worlds are hidden in its essence:<br> Self-affirmation brings Not-self to light.<br> By the Self the seed of hostility is sown in the world:<br> It imagines itself to be other than itself.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_17"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 17</font></a></p>  
 <p>It makes from itself the forms of others <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">195</font></span><br> In order to multiply the pleasure of strife.<br> It is slaying by the strength of its arm<br> That it may become conscious of its own strength.<br> Its self-deceptions are the essence of Life;<br> Like the rose, it lives by bathing itself in blood. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">200</font></span><br> For the sake of a single rose it destroys a hundred rose-gardens<br> And makes a hundred lamentations in quest of a single melody.<br> For one sky it produces a hundred new moons,<br> And for one word a hundred discourses.<br> The excuse for this wastefulness and cruelty <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">205</font></span><br> Is the shaping and perfecting of spiritual beauty.</p>

 <p>The loveliness of Shírín justifies the anguish of Farhád, <a name="fr_31"></a><a href="#fn_31"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> The fragrant navel justifies a hundred musk-deer.<br> Tis the fate of moths to consume in flame:<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">210</font></span> The suffering of moths is justified by the candle.<br> The pencil of the Self limned a hundred to-days<br> In order to achieve the dawn of a single morrow.<br> Its flames burned a hundred Abrahams <a name="fr_32"></a><a href="#fn_32"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> That the lamp of one Mohammed might be lighted.<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">215</font></span> Subject, object, means, and causes<br> They all exist for the purpose of action.</p>

 <p>The Self rises, kindles, falls, glows, breathes,<br> Burns, shines, walks, and flies.<br> The spaciousness of Time is its arena,<br> Heaven is a billow of the dust on its road. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">220</font></span><br> From its rose-planting the world abounds in roses;<br> Night is born of its sleep, day springs from its waking.<br> It divided its flame into sparks<br> And taught the understanding to worship particulars.<br> It dissolved itself and created the atoms, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">225</font></span><br> It was scattered for a little while and created the sands.<br> Then it wearied of dispersion<br> And by re-uniting itself it became the mountains.<br> Tis the nature of the Self to manifest itself:<br> In every atom slumbers the might of the Self. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">230</font></span></p>  
 <p><a name="page_20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 20</font></a></p>  
 <p>Power that is unexpressed and inert<br> Chains the faculties which lead to action.<br> Inasmuch as the life of the universe<br> comes from the strength of the Self,<br> Life is in proportion to this strength.<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">235</font></span> When a drop of water gets the Self's lesson by heart,<br> It makes its worthless existence a pearl.<br> Wine is formless because its self is weak;<br> It receives a form by favour of the cup.<br> Although the cup of wine assumes a form,<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">240</font></span> It is indebted to us for its motion.<br> When the mountain loses its self, it turns into sands<br> And complains that the sea surges over it;<br> But the wave, so long as it remains a wave in the sea's bosom,<br> Makes itself a rider on the sea's back.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_21"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 21</font></a></p>  
 <p>Light has been a beggar since the eye first rolled <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">245</font></span><br> And moved to and fro in search of beauty;<br> But forasmuch as the grass found a<br> means of growth in its self,<br> Its aspiration clove the breast of the garden.<br> The candle too concatenated itself<br> And built itself out of atoms; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">250</font></span><br> Then it made a practice of melting<br> itself away and fled from its self<br> Until at last it trickled down from its own eye, like tears.<br> If the bezel had been more self-secure by nature,<br> It would not have suffered wounds,<br> But since it derives its value from the superscription, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">255</font></span><br> Its shoulder is galled by the burden of another's name.<br> Because the earth is firmly based on self-existence,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_22"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 22</font></a></p>  
 <p>The captive moon goes round it perpetually.<br> The being of the sun is stronger than that of the earth:<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">260</font></span> Therefore is the earth bewitched by the sun's eye.<br> The glory of the plane fixes our gaze,<br> The mountains are enriched by its majesty:<br> Its raiment is woven of fire,<br> Its origin is one self-assertive seed.<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">265</font></span> When Life gathers strength from the Self,<br> The river of Life expands into an ocean.</p>
