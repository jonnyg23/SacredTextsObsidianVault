 <p align="center"><i>Story of a young man of Merv who came to the saint Ali HujwíríGod have mercy on him!and complained that he was oppressed by his enemies</i>.</p>  
 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The</span> saint of Hujwír was venerated by the peoples,<br> And Pír-i Sanjar visited his tomb as a pilgrim. <a name="fr_83"></a><a href="#fn_83"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> With ease he broke down the mountain-barriers loss<br> And sowed the seed of Islam in India.<br> The age of Omar was restored by his godliness,</p>

 <p>The fame of the Truth was exalted by his words.<br> He was a guardian of the honour of the Koran,<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1090</font></span> The house of Falsehood fell in ruins at his gaze.<br> The dust of the Panjáb was brought to life by his breath,<br> Our dawn was made splendid by his sun.<br> He was a lover, and withal a courier of Love:<br> The secrets of Love shone forth from his brow.<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1095</font></span> I will tell a story of his perfection<br> And enclose a whole rose-bed in a single bud.<br> A young man, cypress-tall,<br> Came from the town of Merv to Lahore.<br> He went to see the venerable saint,<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1100</font></span> That the sun might dispel his darkness.<br> I am hemmed in," he said, "by foes;<br> I am as a glass in the midst of stones.</p>

 <p>Do thou teach me, O sire of heavenly rank,<br> How to lead my life amongst enemies!"<br> The wise Director, in whose nature <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1105</font></span><br> Love had allied mercy with wrath,<br> Answered: "Thou art unread in Life's lore,<br> Careless of its end and its beginning.<br> Be without fear of others!<br> Thou art a sleeping force: awake! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1110</font></span><br> When the stone was anxious on account of the glass,<br> It became glass and got into the way of breaking.<br> If the traveller thinks himself weak,<br> He delivers his soul unto the brigand.<br> How long wilt thou regard thyself as water and clay? <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1115</font></span><br> Create from thy clay a flaming Sinai!<br> Why be angry with mighty men?<br> Why complain of enemies?<br> I will declare the truth: thine enemy is thy friend;</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1120</font></span> His existence crowns thee with glory.<br> Whosoever knows the states of the Self<br> Considers a powerful enemy to be a blessing from God.<br> To the seed of Man the enemy is as a rain-cloud:<br> He awakens its potentialities.<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1125</font></span> If thy spirit be strong, the stones in thy way are as water:<br> What reeks the torrent of the ups and downs of the road?<br> The sword of resolution is whetted by the stones in the way<br> And put to proof by traversing stage after stage.<br> What is the use of eating and sleeping like a beast?<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1130</font></span> What is the use of being, unless thou have strength in thyself?<br> When thou makst thyself strong with Self,<br> Thou wilt destroy the world at thy pleasure.</p>

 <p>If thou wouldst pass away, become free of Self;<br> If thou wouldst live, become full of Self! <a name="fr_84"></a><a href="#fn_84"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> What is death? To become oblivious to Self. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1135</font></span><br> Why imagine that it is the parting of soul and body?<br> Abide in Self, like Joseph!<br> Advance from captivity to empire!<br> Think of Self and be a man of action!<br> Be a man of God, bear mysteries within!" <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1140</font></span></p>  
 <p>I will explain the matter by means of stories,<br> I will open the bud by the power of my breath.<br> "Tis better that a lovers secret<br> Should be told by the lips of others." <a name="fr_85"></a><a href="#fn_85"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>
