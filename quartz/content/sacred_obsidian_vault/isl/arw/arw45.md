 <p>To God alone I make my plaint of sorrow and grief (<i>Koran</i> 12, 86).</p>  
 <p>To bewail grief, except to God, is an humiliation.</p>  
 <p>Lamentation is the weapon of the weak.</p>  
 <p>A good man sees his own faults and is blind to the faults of others.</p>  
 <p>Censure your friend by kindness, and return the evil which he may have done to you by acts of favour.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_52"><font size="1" color="green">p. 52</font></a></p>  
 <p>To blame a friend is better than to lose him.</p>  
 <p>No man is free from faults.</p>  
 <p>If you count your friend's faults you will have no friend left.</p>  
 <p>An absent man has his apology with him.</p>  
 <p>He who compels you to blame him has made up his mind to forsake you.</p>  
 <p>Open blame is better than secret malice.</p>  
 <p>Blame not, nor boast, until a year and a half shall have passed away.</p>  
 <p>He who has a needle under his arm it will prick him.</p>  
 <p>There is no wood which has no smoke in it.</p>  
 <p>Among all snakes there is not one that is good.</p>  
 <p>You are your own enemy.</p>
