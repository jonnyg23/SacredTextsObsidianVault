 <p>He who is unthankful for little is unthankful for much.</p>  
 <p>God continues His favours to him who is grateful.</p>  
 <p>He who is ungrateful for the good he receives deserves that it should be withdrawn from him.</p>  
 <p>Man can be thankful to God only so far as he does good to his fellow men.</p>  
 <p>If a man professes to thank God and his wealth decreases, his thanksgiving must be vitiated by his neglect of the hungry and naked.</p>  
 <p>Be grateful to him who has done you good, and do good to him who is grateful to you.</p>  
 <p>Gratitude takes three forms—a feeling in the heart, an expression in words, and a giving in return.</p>
