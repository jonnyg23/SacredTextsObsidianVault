 <p>The advantages of marriage are purity of life, children, pleasures of home, and the happiness of exertion for the comfort of wife and children.</p>  
 <p>This life is a joy, and its greatest delight is a good wife.</p>  
 <p>An honourable marriage is a stepping-stone to honour.</p>  
 <p>Take a wife not for her beauty, but for her virtues.</p>  
 <p>Chastity united to beauty makes a wife perfect.</p>  
 <p>Three things contribute to long life—a large house, an obedient wife, and a swift horse.</p>

 <p>The violence of love vanishes soon after marriage. If the love of bride and bridegroom were to endure, the Resurrection Day would be at hand.</p>  
 <p>A man has no portion in the love of women when he becomes grey, or when he loses his fortune.</p>  
 <p>The lover's eye is blind.</p>  
 <p>The disgrace of a woman is abiding.</p>  
 <p>Take the high-road, though it turn; and marry a woman of good birth, though she may have been passed by.</p>  
 <p>Women are the snares of Satan.</p>  
 <p>Happy is the woman who dies before her husband.</p>  
 <p>It is better to have a thousand enemies out of the house than one in it.</p>  
 <p>The girl who has many suitors, and makes no choice of one of them, is doomed to become an old maid.</p>
