 <p>Hopes are never realised by sloth.</p>  
 <p>A lazy man can never succeed in life.</p>  
 <p>It is one of the signs of weakness to leave things to fate.</p>  
 <p>A lazy man loses what is due to him.</p>  
 <p>Weakness and sloth lead to ruin.</p>  
 <p>A man gets tired of having nothing to do, as he gets tired of work.</p>  
 <p>If work is hard, want of work is a great evil.</p>  
 <p>Youth, riches, and leisure are the great corrupters of life.</p>  
 <p>The head of an idle man is the workshop of Satan.</p>
