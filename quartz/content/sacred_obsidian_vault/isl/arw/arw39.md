 <p>Of all men God abhors most an implacable enemy.</p>  
 <p>Of all things nothing is so bad as the making of enemies.</p>  
 <p>Of all evils nothing is so hard to be borne as the triumph of an enemy.</p>  
 <p>Rejoice not over a fallen man—he may rise and you may fall.</p>  
 <p>Despise no enemy, however insignificant he may be—see how the shadow of the earth causes an eclipse of the moon, or how a midge brings a tear to the eye of a lion.</p>  
 <p>He who makes enemies shall have many a restless night.</p>  
 <p>He who has many enemies, let him expect a downfall.</p>

 <p>When anger is repressed by reason of inability to do immediate harm, it retires into the heart in the form of malice and breeds these vices—envy, triumph over the enemy's ill, repulsion of friendly approaches, contempt, slander, derision, personal violence, and injustice.</p>
