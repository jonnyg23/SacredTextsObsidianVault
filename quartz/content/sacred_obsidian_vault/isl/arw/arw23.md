 <p>If you consult a wise man, his wisdom becomes yours.</p>  
 <p>Confide your secret to one only, and hear the counsel of a thousand. (In the multitude of counsellors there is safety. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Prov</span>. xi. 14.)</p>  
 <p>A counsellor is a trusted man.</p>  
 <p>When men consult together, they are led by the wisest among them.</p>  
 <p>The knowledge of two is better than the knowledge of one. Two heads are better than one.</p>  
 <p>Let your counsellor be one who fears God.</p>  
 <p>Consult a man of experience, for he gives you what has cost him much, and for which you give nothing.</p>  
 <p>A man who is older than yourself by a day is more experienced than you by a year.</p>  
 <p>Consult an older man and a younger, then decide for yourself.</p>

 <p>The wisest may need the advice of others.</p>  
 <p>He who is wise, and consults others, is a whole man; he who has a wise opinion of his own, and seeks no counsel from others, is half a man; and he who has no opinion of his own, and seeks no advice, is no man at all.</p>  
 <p>No man can be sorry for seeking advice, or happy if he blindly follows out his own thoughts.</p>
