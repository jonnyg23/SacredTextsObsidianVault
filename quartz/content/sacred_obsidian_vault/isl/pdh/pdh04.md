 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Poems from the Divan of Hafiz</i>, by Getrude Lowthian Bell, [1897], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h2 align="center">II</h2>  
 <p>THE bird of gardens sang unto the rose,<br> New blown in the clear dawn: "Bow down thy head!<br> As fair as thou within this garden close,<br> Many have bloomed and died." She laughed and said<br> "That I am born to fade grieves not my heart<br> But never was it a true lover's part<br> To vex with bitter words his love's repose."</p>  
 <p>The tavern step shall be thy hostelry,<br> For Love's diviner breath comes but to those<br> That suppliant on the dusty threshold lie.<br> And thou, if thou wouldst drink the wine that flows<br> From Life's bejewelled goblet, ruby red,<br> Upon thine eyelashes thine eyes shall thread<br> A thousand tears for this temerity.</p>  
 <p>Last night when Irem's magic garden slept,<br> Stirring the hyacinth's purple tresses curled,<br> The wind of morning through the alleys stept.<br> "Where is thy cup, the mirror of the world?<br> Ah, where is Love, thou Throne of Djem?" I cried.<br> The breezes knew not; but "Alas," they sighed,<br> "That happiness should sleep so long!" and wept.</p>  
 <p>Not on the lips of men Love's secret lies,<br> Remote and unrevealed his dwelling-place.<br> Oh Saki, come! the idle laughter dies<br> When thou the feast with heavenly wine dost grace.<br> Patience and wisdom, Hafiz, in a sea<br> Of thine own tears are drowned; thy misery<br> They could not still nor hide from curious eyes.</p>
