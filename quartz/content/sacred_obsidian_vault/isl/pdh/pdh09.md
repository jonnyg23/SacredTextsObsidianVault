 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Poems from the Divan of Hafiz</i>, by Getrude Lowthian Bell, [1897], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h2 align="center">VII</h2>  
 <p>FROM the garden of Heaven a western breeze<br> Blows through the leaves of my garden of earth;<br> With a love like a huri Ild take mine ease,<br> And wine! bring me wine, the giver of mirth!<br> To-day the beggar may boast him a king,<br> His banqueting-hall is the ripening field,<br> And his tent the shadow that soft clouds fling.</p>  
 <p>A tale of April the meadows unfold<br> Ah, foolish for future credit to slave,<br> And to leave the cash of the present untold!<br> Build a fort with wine where thy heart may brave<br> The assault of the world; when thy fortress falls,<br> The relentless victor shall knead from thy dust<br> The bricks that repair its crumbling walls.</p>  
 <p>Trust not the word of that foe in the fight!<br> Shall the lamp of the synagogue lend its flame<br> To set thy monastic torches alight?<br> Drunken am I, yet place not my name<br> In the Book of Doom, nor pass judgment on it;<br> Who knows what the secret finger of Fate<br> Upon his own white forehead has writ!</p>  
 <p>And when the spirit of Hafiz has fled,<br> Follow his bier with a tribute of sighs;<br> Though the ocean of sin has closed o'er his head,<br> He may find a place in God's Paradise.</p>
