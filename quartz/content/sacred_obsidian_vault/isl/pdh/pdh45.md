 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Poems from the Divan of Hafiz</i>, by Getrude Lowthian Bell, [1897], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h2 align="center">XLIII</h2>  
 <p>WHERE are the tidings of union? that I may arise<br> Forth from the dust I will rise up to welcome thee!<br> My soul, like a homing bird, yearning for Paradise,<br> Shall arise and soar, from the snares of the world set free.<br> When the voice of thy love shall call me to be thy slave,<br> I shall rise to a greater far than the mastery<br> Of life and the living, time and the mortal span:<br> Pour down, oh Lord! from the clouds of thy guiding grace.<br> The rain of a mercy that quickeneth on my grave,<br> Before, like dust that the wind bears from place to place,<br> I arise and flee beyond the knowledge of man.<br> When to my grave thou turnest thy blessed feet,<br> Wine and the lute thou shalt bring in thine hand to me,<br> Thy voice shall ring through the folds of my winding-sheet,<br> And I will arise and dance to thy minstrelsy.<br> Though I be old, clasp me one night to thy breast,<br> And I, when the dawn shall come to awaken me,<br> With the flush of youth on my check from thy bosom will rise.<br> Rise up! let mine eyes delight in thy stately grace!<br> Thou art the goal to which all men's endeavour has pressed,<br> And thou the idol of Hafiz worship; thy face<br> From the world and life shall bid him come forth and arise!</p>
