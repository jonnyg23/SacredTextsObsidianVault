 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Poems from the Divan of Hafiz</i>, by Getrude Lowthian Bell, [1897], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h2 align="center">XIV</h2>  
 <p>THE nightingale with drops of his heart's blood<br> Had nourished the red rose, then came a wind,<br> And catching at the boughs in envious mood,<br> A hundred thorns about his heart entwined.<br> Like to the parrot crunching sugar, good<br> Seemed the world to me who could not stay<br> The wind of Death that swept my hopes away.</p>  
 <p>Light of mine eyes and harvest of my heart,<br> And mine at least in changeless memory!<br> Ah, when he found it easy to depart,<br> He left the harder pilgrimage to me!<br> Oh Camel-driver, though the cordage start,<br> For God's sake help me lift my fallen load,<br> And Pity be my comrade of the road!</p>  
 <p>My face is seamed with dust, mine eyes are wet.<br> Of dust and tears the turquoise firmament<br> Kneadeth the bricks for joy's abode; and yet . . .<br> Alas, and weeping yet I make lament!<br> Because the moon her jealous glances set<br> Upon the bow-bent eyebrows of my moon,<br> He sought a lodging in the grave-too soon!</p>  
 <p>I had not castled, and the time is gone.<br> What shall I play? Upon the chequered floor<br> Of Night and Day, Death won the game-forlorn<br> And careless now, Hafiz can lose no more.</p>
