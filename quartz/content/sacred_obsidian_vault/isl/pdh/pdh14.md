 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Poems from the Divan of Hafiz</i>, by Getrude Lowthian Bell, [1897], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h2 align="center">XII</h2>  
 <p>WHERE is my ruined life, and where the fame<br> Of noble deeds?<br> Look on my long-drawn road, and whence it came,<br> And where it leads!</p>  
 <p>Can drunkenness be linked to piety<br> And good repute?<br> Where is the preacher's holy monody,<br> Where is the lute?</p>  
 <p>From monkish cell and lying garb released,<br> Oh heart of mine,<br> Where is the Tavern fane, the Tavern priest,<br> Where is the wine?</p>  
 <p>Past days of meeting, let the memory<br> Of you be sweet!<br> Where are those glances fled, and where for me<br> Reproaches meet?</p>  
 <p>His friend's bright face warms not the enemy<br> When love is done<br> Where is the extinguished lamp that made night day,<br> Where is the sun?</p>  
 <p>Balm to mine eyes the dust, my head I bow<br> Upon thy stair.<br> Where shall I go, where from thy presence? thou<br> Art everywhere.</p>  
 <p>Look not upon the dimple of her chin,<br> Danger lurks there!<br> Where wilt thou hide, oh trembling heart, fleeing in<br> Such mad hastewhere?</p>  
 <p>To steadfastness and patience, friend, ask not<br> If Hafiz keep<br> Patience and steadfastness I have forgot,<br> And where is sleep?</p>
