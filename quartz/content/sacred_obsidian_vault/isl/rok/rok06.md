 <p>CHAPTER III., Verse 136.—Muhammad is but an apostle; apostles have passed away before his time; what if he die or is killed, will ye retreat upon your heels? He who retreats upon his heels does no harm to God at all; but God will recompense the thankful. It is not for any soul to die, save by God's permission written down for an appointed time; but he who wishes for the reward of this world we will give him of it, and he who wishes for the reward of the future we will give him of it, and we will recompense the grateful.</p>  
 <p>Chapter IV., Verse 164.—But God bears witness to what He has revealed to thee; He revealed it in His knowledge, and the angels bear witness too, though God is witness enough.</p>  
 <p>(165).—Verily, those who misbelieve and obstruct the way of God, have erred a wide error.</p>  
 <p>Verily, those who misbelieve and are unjust, God will not pardon them, nor will He guide them on the road—save the road to Hell, to dwell therein for aye; that is easy enough to God!</p>  
 <p>O ye folk! the Apostle has come to you with truth from your Lord; believe then, for it is</p>  
 <p><a name="page_35"><font size="1" color="green">p. 35</font></a></p>  
 <p>better for you. But if ye misbelieve, then God's is what is in the heavens and the earth, and God is knowing, wise.</p>  
 <p>Chapter VI., Verse 49.—We do not send our messengers save as heralds of glad tidings and of warning, and whoso believes and acts aright, there is no fear for them, and they shall not be grieved, but those who say our signs are lies, torment shall touch them, for that they have done so wrong.</p>  
 <p>(50).—Say, "I do not say to you, mine are the treasuries of God, nor that I know the unseen; I do not say to you, I am an angel—if I follow aught but what I am inspired with;" say, "Is the blind equal to him who sees?" What! do ye not reflect?</p>  
 <p>Admonish therewith those who fear that they shall be gathered unto their Lord; there is no patron for them but Him, and no intercessor; haply they may fear.</p>  
 <p>Repulse not those who call upon their Lord in the morning and in the evening, desiring His face; they have no reckoning against thee at all, and thou hast no reckoning against them at all; repulse them and thou wilt be of the unjust.</p>  
 <p>So have we tried some of them by others, that they may say, "Are these those unto whom God has been gracious amongst ourselves?" Does not God know those who give thanks?</p>  
 <p>And when those who believe in our signs come to thee, say, "Peace be on you! God hath prescribed for Himself mercy; verily, he of you who does evil in ignorance, and then turns again and does right,—verily, He is forgiving and merciful.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_36"><font size="1" color="green">p. 36</font></a></p>  
 <p>(55).—Thus do we detail our signs, that the way of the sinners may be made plain.</p>  
 <p>Say, "I am forbidden to worship those ye call upon beside God;" say, "I will not follow your lusts, for then should I err and not be of the guided."</p>  
 <p>Say, "I stand on a manifestation from my Lord, which ye call a lie. I have not with me what ye fain would hasten on, that the matter might be settled between me and you; but God knows best who are the unjust."</p>  
 <p>Chapter XXXIII., Verse 40.—Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but the Apostle of God, and the Seal of the Prophets; for God all things doth know!</p>
