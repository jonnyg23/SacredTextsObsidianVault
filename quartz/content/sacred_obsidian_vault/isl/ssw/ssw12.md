 <p>Sons of Adam from learning will find perfection—<br> Not from dignity, and rank, and wealth, and property.<br> Like a taper one must melt in pursuit of learning,<br> Since without learning one cannot know God.<br> A man of wisdom is a student of learning,<br> For the market of wisdom is always brisk.<br> Whoever is fortunate as regards Eternity,<br> Maketh choice of the pursuit of knowledge. <a name="page_38"><font size="1" color="green">p. 38</font></a><br> This pursuit of knowledge is a duty on thy part,<br> Even if it be necessary to traverse the earth.<br> Go, seize fast hold of the skirt of knowledge,<br> For learning will convey thee to everlasting abodes.<br> Seek nought but knowledge if thou art wise,<br> For it is neglectful to remain without wisdom.<br> From learning there will come to thee perfection as regards religion and the world,<br> For thine affairs will be settled by knowledge.</p>
