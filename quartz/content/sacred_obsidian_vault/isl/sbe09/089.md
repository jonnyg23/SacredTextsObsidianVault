 <p>IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.</p>  
 <p>By the dawn and ten nights <a name="fr_482"></a><a href="#fn_482"><font size="1">2</font></a>!</p>  
 <p>And the single and the double!</p>  
 <p>And the night when it travels on!</p>  
 <p>Is there in that an oath for a man of sense?</p>  
 <p>[5] Hast thou not seen how thy Lord did with ‘Âd?--with Iram of the columns <a name="fr_483"></a><a href="#fn_483"><font size="1">3</font></a>? the like of which has not been created in the land?</p>  
 <p>
 </p>

 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_331"><font size="1" color="green">p. 331</font></a></p>  
 <p>And Thamûd when they hewed the stones in the valley?</p>  
 <p>And Pharaoh of the stakes <a name="fr_484"></a><a href="#fn_484"><font size="1">1</font></a>?</p>  
 <p>[10] Who were outrageous in the land, and did multiply wickedness therein, and thy Lord poured out upon them the scourge of torment.</p>  
 <p>Verily, thy Lord is on a watch tower! and as for man, whenever his Lord tries him and honours him and grants him favour, then [15] he says, 'My Lord has honoured me;' but whenever he tries him and doles out to him his subsistence, then he says, 'My Lord despises me!'</p>  
 <p>Nay, but ye do not honour the orphan, nor do ye urge each other to feed the poor, [20] and ye devour the inheritance (of the weak) with a general devouring <a name="fr_485"></a><a href="#fn_485"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and ye love wealth with a complete love!</p>  
 <p>Nay, when the earth is crushed to pieces, and thy Lord comes with the angels, rank on rank, and hell is brought on that day,--on that day shall man be reminded! but how shall he have a reminder?</p>  
 <p>[25] He will say, 'Would that I had sent something forward for my life!'</p>  
 <p>But on that day no one shall be tormented with a torment like his, and none shall be bound with bonds like his!</p>  
 <p>O thou comforted soul! return unto thy Lord, well pleased and well pleased with!</p>  
 <p>And enter amongst my servants, [30] and enter my Paradise!</p>

On going to take possession of it, he and all his people were struck dead by a noise from heaven, and the paradise disappeared. Certain Arab travellers are declared to have come across this mysterious garden.</p>
