Mecca.)</h3>  
 <p>IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.</p>  
 <p>O thou who art covered! rise up and warn! And thy Lord magnify!</p>  
 <p>[5] And thy garments purify!</p>  
 <p>And abomination shun!</p>  
 <p>And grant not favours to gain increase!</p>  
 <p>And for thy Lord await!</p>  
 <p>And when the trump is blown,--for that day is a</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_309"><font size="1" color="green">p. 309</font></a></p>  
 <p>difficult day! [10] for the misbelievers aught but easy!</p>  
 <p>Leave me alone with him I have created, and for whom I have made extensive wealth <a name="fr_442"></a><a href="#fn_442"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and sons that he may look upon, and for whom I have smoothed things down. [15] Then he desires that I should increase! nay, verily, he is hostile to our signs! I will drive him up a hill! Then he reflected and planned! May he be killed,--how he planned! [20] Again, may he be killed,--how he planned! Then he looked; then he frowned and scowled; then he retreated and was big with pride and said, 'This is only magic exhibited! [25] this is only mortal speech!'--I will broil him in hell-fire! and what shall make thee know what hell-fire is? It will not leave and will not let alone. It scorches the flesh; [30] over it are nineteen (angels).</p>  
 <p>We have made only angels guardians of the fire, and we have only made their number a trial to those who misbelieve; that those who have been given the Book may be certain, and that those who believe may be increased in faith; and that those who have been given the Book and the believers may not doubt; and that those in whose hearts is sickness, and the misbelievers may say, 'What does God mean by this as a parable?'</p>  
 <p>Thus God leads astray whom He pleases, and guides him He pleases: and none knows the hosts of thy Lord save Himself; and it is only a reminder to mortals!</p>  
 <p>[35] Nay, by the moon!</p>  
 <p>And the night when it retires!</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_310"><font size="1" color="green">p. 310</font></a></p>  
 <p>And the morning when it brightly dawns!</p>  
 <p>Verily, it is one of the greatest misfortunes; a warning to mortals; [40] for him amongst you who wishes to press forward or to tarry!</p>  
 <p>Every soul is pledged <a name="fr_443"></a><a href="#fn_443"><font size="1">1</font></a> for what it earns; except the fellows of the right: in gardens shall they ask each other about the sinners!--`What drove you into hell-fire?'</p>  
 <p>They shall say, 'We weren't <a name="fr_444"></a><a href="#fn_444"><font size="1">2</font></a> of those who prayed; [45] we didn't feed the poor; but we did plunge into discussion with those who plunged, and we called the judgment day a lie until the certainty <a name="fr_445"></a><a href="#fn_445"><font size="1">3</font></a> did come to us!'</p>  
 <p>But there shall not profit them the intercession of the intercessors.</p>  
 <p>[50] What ailed them that they turned away from the memorial as though they were timid asses fleeing from a lion?</p>  
 <p>Nay, every man of them wished that he might have given him books spread open!</p>  
 <p>Nay, but they did not fear the hereafter!</p>  
 <p>Nay, it is a memorial! and let him who will remember it; [55] but none will remember it except God please. He is most worthy of fear; and he is most worthy to forgive!</p>
