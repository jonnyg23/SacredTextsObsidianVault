 <p>IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.</p>  
 <p>By those who tear out violently!</p>  
 <p>And by those who gaily release <a name="fr_456"></a><a href="#fn_456"><font size="1">1</font></a>!</p>  
 <p>And by those who float through the air!</p>  
 <p>And the preceders who precede <a name="fr_457"></a><a href="#fn_457"><font size="1">2</font></a>!</p>  
 <p>[5] And those who manage the affair!</p>  
 <p>On the day when the quaking <a name="fr_458"></a><a href="#fn_458"><font size="1">3</font></a> quakes which the following one shall succeed! Hearts on that day shall tremble; eyes thereon be humbled!</p>  
 <p>[10] They say, 'Shall we be sent back to our old course?--What! when we are rotten bones?' they say, 'That then were a losing return!'</p>  
 <p>But it will only be one scare, and lo! they will be on the surface!</p>  
 <p>[15] Has the story of Moses <a name="fr_459"></a><a href="#fn_459"><font size="1">4</font></a> come to you? when his Lord addressed him in the holy valley of <i>T</i>uvâ, 'Go unto Pharaoh, verily, he is outrageous; and say, "Hast thou a wish to purify thyself, and that I may guide thee to thy Lord, and thou mayest fear?"'</p>  
 <p>[20] So he showed him the greatest signs; but</p>  
 <p>

 <p>he called him a liar and rebelled. Then he re-treated hastily, and gathered, and proclaimed, and said, 'I am your Lord most High!' [25] but God seized him with the punishment of the future life and of the former.</p>  
 <p>Verily, in that is a lesson to him who fears!</p>  
 <p>Are ye harder to create or the heaven that He has built? He raised its height and fashioned it; and made its night to cover it, and brought forth its noonday light; [30] and the earth after that He did stretch out. He brings forth from it its water and its pasture.</p>  
 <p>And the mountains He did firmly set, a provision for you and for your cattle.</p>  
 <p>And when the great predominant calamity shall come, [35] on the day when man shall remember what he strove after, and hell shall be brought out for him who sees!</p>  
 <p>And as for him who was outrageous and preferred the life of this world, verily, hell is the resort!</p>  
 <p>[40] But as for him who feared the station of his Lord, and prohibited his soul from lust, verily, Paradise is the resort!</p>  
 <p>They shall ask thee about the Hour, for when it is set. Whereby canst thou mention it? Unto thy Lord its period belongs.</p>  
 <p>[45] Thou art only a warner to him who fears it. On the day they see it, it will be as though they had only tarried an evening or the noon thereof.</p>
