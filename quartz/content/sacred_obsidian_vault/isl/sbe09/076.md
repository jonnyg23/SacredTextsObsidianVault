 <p>IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.</p>  
 <p>Does there not come on man a portion of time when he is nothing worth mentioning <a name="fr_450"></a><a href="#fn_450"><font size="1">2</font></a>?</p>  
 <p>Verily, we created man from a mingled clot, to try him; and we gave him hearing and sight. Verily, we guided him in the way, whether he be grateful or ungrateful.</p>  
 <p>Verily, we have prepared for those who misbelieve chains and fetters and a blaze!</p>  
 <p>[5] Verily, the righteous shall drink of a cup tempered with Kâfûr <a name="fr_451"></a><a href="#fn_451"><font size="1">3</font></a>, a spring from which God's servants shall drink and make it gush out as they please!</p>  
 <p>They who fulfil their vows, and fear a day, the evil</p>

 <p>which shall fly abroad, and who give food for His love to the poor and the orphan and the captive. 'We only feed you for God's sake; we desire not from you either reward or thanks; [10] we fear from our Lord a frowning, calamitous day!'</p>  
 <p>And God will guard them from the evil of that day and will cast on them brightness and joy; and their reward for their patience shall be Paradise and silk! reclining therein upon couches they shall neither see therein sun nor piercing cold <a name="fr_452"></a><a href="#fn_452"><font size="1">1</font></a>; and close down upon them shall be its shadows; and lowered over them its fruits to cull; [15] and they shall be served round with vessels of silver and goblets that are as flagons--flagons of silver which they shall mete out! and they shall drink therein a cup tempered with Zin<i>g</i>abîl <a name="fr_453"></a><a href="#fn_453"><font size="1">2</font></a>, a spring therein named Silsabîl! and there shall go round about them eternal boys; when thou seest them thou wilt think them scattered pearls; [20] and when thou seest them thou shalt see pleasure and a great estate! On them shall be garments of green embroidered satin and brocade; and they shall be adorned with bracelets of silver; and their Lord shall give them to drink pure drink! Verily, this is a reward for you, and your efforts are thanked.</p>

 <p>Verily, these love the transitory life, and leave behind them a heavy day!</p>  
 <p>We created them and strengthened their joints; and if we please we can exchange for the likes of them in their stead. Verily, this is a memorial, and whoso will, let him take unto his Lord a way.</p>  
 <p>[30] But ye will not please except God please! Verily, God is knowing, wise.</p>  
 <p>He makes whomsoever He pleases to enter into His mercy; but the unjust He has prepared for them a grievous woe!</p>
