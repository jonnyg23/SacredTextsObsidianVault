 <p>‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: I was at Nishapur <a name="fr_901"></a><a href="#fn_901"><font size="1">2</font></a> on a Friday so I presented myself at the <i>obligatory</i>. <a name="fr_902"></a><a href="#fn_902"><font size="1">3</font></a> When I had performed it there passed by me a man who had donned a tall hat and turned a portion of his turban beneath his chin <a name="fr_903"></a><a href="#fn_903"><font size="1">4</font></a> like the Sunni's. So I asked the worshipper at my side, 'Who is this?' He said: 'This is a moth that attacks none but the woollen garment of the orphans, a locust that falls upon none but the forbidden crop, a burglar that breaks into <a name="fr_904"></a><a href="#fn_904"><font size="1">5</font></a> none but the treasury of pious bequests, a Kurd that raids upon none but the weak, a wolf that preys upon none but God's servants, between their kneeling and prostration, a warrior that plunders nothing but God's property, under cover of covenants and witnesses. He has donned his tall hat but doffed his piety; he has conventionally put on his cloak but perverted the use of his, hand</p>

 <p>and tongue; he has clipped short his moustache <a name="fr_905"></a><a href="#fn_905"><font size="1">1</font></a> but lengthened his snares; he has displayed his vehement eloquence, <a name="fr_906"></a><a href="#fn_906"><font size="1">2</font></a> but covered up his defects; he has whitened his beard, <a name="fr_907"></a><a href="#fn_907"><font size="1">3</font></a> but blackened his record; he has paraded his abstinence, but concealed his greed.' I said: 'May God curse the fellow! but who art thou?' He replied: 'I am a man known as al-Iskanderí.' I said: 'May God bless the land <a name="fr_908"></a><a href="#fn_908"><font size="1">4</font></a> that grew this excellence, and the father that left this progeny, and, where art thou going?' He answered, 'To the Ka‘ba.' So I said: 'Excellent! Excellent! is its feast, though still unprepared! We are, in that case, fellow-travellers.' He said: 'How is that, when I am going up and thou art going down?' I asked: 'How canst thou go <i>up</i> to the Ka‘ba?' He replied: 'But I am going to the Ka‘ba of the needy, not to the Ka‘ba of the pilgrims, to the station of generosity not the station of sanctity, <a name="fr_909"></a><a href="#fn_909"><font size="1">5</font></a> to the house of captives, <a name="fr_910"></a><a href="#fn_910"><font size="1">6</font></a> not to the house of sacrifices, to the source of gifts, <a name="fr_911"></a><a href="#fn_911"><font size="1">7</font></a> not the Qibla <a name="fr_912"></a><a href="#fn_912"><font size="1">8</font></a> of prayer, to the desire <a name="fr_913"></a><a href="#fn_913"><font size="1">9</font></a> of guests, not to the Mina of Khaif.' <a name="fr_914"></a><a href="#fn_914"><font size="1">10</font></a> I asked: 'And where are these excellences?'

 <h3 align="CENTER">Footnotes</h3>
 <p><a name="fn_901"></a><a href="mhm47.htm#fr_901">150:2</a> Nishapur (<i>Naisabur</i>): A well-known town, the capital of the province of the same name, situated forty-nine miles west of Meshed. It was captured by the Arabs in A.H. 31. Yaqút in his <i>Geographical Dictionary</i>, iv, 757, referring to this place says of all the cities he had visited Naisabur (Nishapur) was the finest. It was in this city, says Tha‘alibi (<i>Yatima</i>, iv, 168) that Hamadhání wrote his four hundred maqámát and vanquished his great literary rival the renowned Abú Bakr al-Khwárazmí.</p>

The primary meaning is loudness of voice and then vehement eloquence. Shiqshiqa is also the name of a sermon preached by ‘Alí and interrupted by a member of the congregation, a man from ‘Iráq, handing him a letter. When desired by Ibn ‘Abbás to continue his address, ‘Alí answered: 'Alas! Ibn ‘Abbás, the Shiqshiqa has roared and subsided', meaning that the inspiration of the moment had gone. [<i>Nahaj</i><i> al-Balágha</i>, p. 26 (Beyrut ed. A.H. 1308)]. The saying became proverbial. See Freytag, <i>Arab Proverbs</i>, i, 673.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_915"></a><a href="mhm47.htm#fr_915">152:1</a> <i>Where are the Faith and the king:</i> Metre, <i>wafir</i>. These expressions regarding the two Ka‘bas will be found in No. 38, page 101, of Hamadhání's Letters. They are cited by Tha‘álibí (<i>Yatíma</i> iv, 176) as a specimen of Hamadhání's elegant epistolary style. They are also quoted by Ibn Khallikan, 113. Their chief merit consists of a mere play on words impossible to preserve in a rendering into English. For similar and additional criticisms of the Qáḍí and a description of what a Qáḍí should be, see the Author's Letters, pp. 168-9.</p>
