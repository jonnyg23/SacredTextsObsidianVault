 <p>‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: I entered Baṣra when I was wide of fame and abundant of reputation, and there came to me two young men. One of them said: 'May God strengthen the Shaikh! this youth entered our house and seized a kitten <a name="fr_778"></a><a href="#fn_778"><font size="1">4</font></a> with vertigo in its head, with the sacred cord <a name="fr_779"></a><a href="#fn_779"><font size="1">5</font></a> and a whirling sphere around its middle.

If it be given a thing, it returns it. If it be tasked with a journey, it goes energetically, and, if it is made to draw the rope, it lengthens it. There it is, bone and wood.

He suggests that the correct word is <font color="GREEN">…</font> from the Persian <font color="GREEN">…</font> a furred animal and, as the context shows, a kitten. I think his view is correct.
