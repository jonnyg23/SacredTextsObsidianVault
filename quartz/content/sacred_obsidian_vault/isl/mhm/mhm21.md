 <p>‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM: related to us and said: I entered Baṣra <a name="fr_379"></a><a href="#fn_379"><font size="1">6</font></a> when, as regards age, I was in the prime of youth; as to attire,</p>  
 <p>I was clad in the variegated striped stuffs of Yemen, and, in the</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_65"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 65</font></a></p>  
 <p>matter of wealth, I had cattle and sheep. And I came to Mirbad <a name="fr_380"></a><a href="#fn_380"><font size="1">1</font></a> with some friends upon whom eyes fastened. <a name="fr_381"></a><a href="#fn_381"><font size="1">2</font></a> We proceeded a short distance to the recreation grounds among the green plains wherein a certain spot arrested us and so we alighted there. We made for the gaming arrows of pleasure and whirled them, throwing off bashfulness, as there was not one among us <a name="fr_382"></a><a href="#fn_382"><font size="1">3</font></a> who was not of us. But in less than the twinkling of an eye, there came in our view the figure <a name="fr_383"></a><a href="#fn_383"><font size="1">4</font></a> of a man which the hollows lowered from, and the ridges exposed to sight. We perceived <a name="fr_384"></a><a href="#fn_384"><font size="1">5</font></a> he was coming towards us and so we craned our necks to see him, till his journeying brought him to us. He greeted us with the salutation of Islám and we returned him the due greeting. <a name="fr_385"></a><a href="#fn_385"><font size="1">6</font></a></p>  
 <p>Then he ran his eye over us and said: 'O people, there is not one of you but looks askance at me with excessive caution. Now none can acquaint you concerning me more truthfully than I can myself. I am a man from among the citizens of Alexandria <a name="fr_386"></a><a href="#fn_386"><font size="1">7</font></a> on the Umayyad frontiers. <a name="fr_387"></a><a href="#fn_387"><font size="1">8</font></a> Excellence was generous to me, <a name="fr_388"></a><a href="#fn_388"><font size="1">9</font></a> pleasure hailed me, and a distinguished house bred me.</p>  
 <p>Then did fortune deny me both her meaner and better gifts, and caused little ones with inflamed crops to follow me,</p>  
 <p></p><dir>As if they were serpents <a name="fr_389"></a><a href="#fn_389"><font size="1">10</font></a> in an arid land,<br> Whose venom would be fatal were they to bite.<br> When we tarry they send me out to earn,<br> And when we travel they ride on me.'</dir>

Abú Málik <a name="fr_395"></a><a href="#fn_395"><font size="1">6</font></a> hath come to us. Abú Jábir only visits us when we are barren of strength, <a name="fr_396"></a><a href="#fn_396"><font size="1">7</font></a> and the waters of this Baṣra promote digestion while her poor are oppressed. Man is occupied in getting something for his teeth and is in anxiety concerning himself. What then is the case of him,</p>  
 <p></p><dir>'Who roams and roams <a name="fr_397"></a><a href="#fn_397"><font size="1">8</font></a> and then returns,<br> To stay with chicks whose sight is made keen, <a name="fr_398"></a><a href="#fn_398"><font size="1">9</font></a><br> Whose covering is old, whose hair is matted and dusty so that they are ever<br> Ravenous <a name="fr_399"></a><a href="#fn_399"><font size="1">10</font></a> and lank-bellied.'</dir>  
 <p>Verily to-day they arose in the morning and looked upon a living person who is like one dead, and at a home which was like no home. They wrung their hands longingly, put their ribs out of joint, <a name="fr_400"></a><a href="#fn_400"><font size="1">11</font></a> shed tears and addressed one another by the name of <i>Hunger:</i></p>  
 <p></p><dir>'And poverty in the day of the mean, <a name="fr_401"></a><a href="#fn_401"><font size="1">12</font></a><br> Is every generous man's badge.<br> The generous incline towards the mean,<br> And this is one of the signs of the last day.'</dir>

 <p>My lords, ye have been chosen by me and I have sworn, verily in them is advantage. <a name="fr_402"></a><a href="#fn_402"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>'Now is there a youth who will give them a supper, or cover them? And is there a generous man who will grant them a morning meal, or clothe them?'</p>  
 <p>Said ‘Ísá ibn Hishám: By Heavens! there had never sought the seclusion of my ear a speech more winning, estimable, loftier or more original than that which I heard from him. Perforce we had recourse to our belts, <a name="fr_403"></a><a href="#fn_403"><font size="1">2</font></a> rejecting our sleeves, and eschewing our pockets. <a name="fr_404"></a><a href="#fn_404"><font size="1">3</font></a> And I gave him my ornamented robe <a name="fr_405"></a><a href="#fn_405"><font size="1">4</font></a> and the company followed my example, <a name="fr_406"></a><a href="#fn_406"><font size="1">5</font></a> and we said to him: 'Go and join thy children.' So he turned away from us after thanksgiving, to which he rendered the full meed, and eulogy with which he filled his mouth.</p>
