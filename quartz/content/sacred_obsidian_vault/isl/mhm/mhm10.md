 <p>‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: I was in Baghdad at the time of the azaz date harvest, so I went out to select and buy some of the different kinds of it. I proceeded a short distance to a man who had got a stock of various sorts of fruit which he had arranged in order. He had collected and placed in rows a variety of fresh dates and I took some of the best of everything and picked <a name="fr_152"></a><a href="#fn_152"><font size="1">1</font></a> some of the finest of every species. Now just as I had gathered up my skirts and placed my load in them, my eyes fell upon a man who had modestly covered his face with a veil <a name="fr_153"></a><a href="#fn_153"><font size="1">2</font></a> and was standing still with outstretched hand. He had his little ones by his side and bore his babes on his hip, while he recited in a voice so loud that it weakened his chest and produced feebleness in his spine:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir>'Alas! I have neither two handfuls of Sawíq, <a name="fr_154"></a><a href="#fn_154"><font size="1">3</font></a><br> Nor melted fat mixed with flour,<br> Nor spacious bowl filled with Khirdíq, <a name="fr_155"></a><a href="#fn_155"><font size="1">4</font></a><br> To soothe our palate, <a name="fr_156"></a><a href="#fn_156"><font size="1">5</font></a><br> And to remove us from the path of beggary.<br> O Giver of plenty after poverty!<br> Make it easy for some brave and liberal man<br> Of pedigree and hereditary glory,<br> To guide to us the feet of fortune<br> And release my life from the grip of trouble.'</dir>  
 <p>‘Ísá ibn Hishám said: I took from my purse a handful and gave it to him. Then he said:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir>O the one who hath bestowed <a name="fr_157"></a><a href="#fn_157"><font size="1">6</font></a> upon me his excellent kindness!<br> To God do I communicate his glorious secret,<br> And I pray God to keep him well-guarded,</dir>

 <p></p><dir>If I have not the ability to thank him,<br> Then God, my Lord, will surely recompense him.' <a name="fr_158"></a><a href="#fn_158"><font size="1">1</font></a></dir>  
 <p>‘Ísá ibn Hishám said: So I said to him, 'There is something left in the purse, therefore disclose thy hidden condition and I will give thee all.' Then he removed his veil, <a name="fr_159"></a><a href="#fn_159"><font size="1">2</font></a> and to by Heavens! it was our Shaikh, Abú’l-Fatḥ al-Iskánderí! So I exclaimed: 'Mercy on thee, how astute thou art!' Then he recited:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir>'Spend thy life in deceiving <a name="fr_160"></a><a href="#fn_160"><font size="1">3</font></a><br> Men and throwing dust in their eyes.<br> I observe the days continue not<br> In one state and therefore I imitate them.<br> One day I feel their mischief,<br> And another they feel mine.'</dir>
