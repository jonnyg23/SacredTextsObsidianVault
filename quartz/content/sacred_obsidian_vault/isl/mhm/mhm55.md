 <p>‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: While we were at Sariah <a name="fr_1036"></a><a href="#fn_1036"><font size="1">3</font></a> with the governor thereof there came before him a youth with the fragrance of saffron upon him. So the assembly stood up for him and, out of respect, he was seated in the chief place; but awe of him hindered me from asking him his name. Then he began and said to the governor: 'What hast thou done with yesterday's discussion, perhaps thou hast relegated it to oblivion?' <a name="fr_1037"></a><a href="#fn_1037"><font size="1">4</font></a> He said: 'God forbid! but there has hindered me from attaining to it a reason which it is impossible to explain, and one whose wounds <a name="fr_1038"></a><a href="#fn_1038"><font size="1">5</font></a> cannot be healed?' Said the intruder: 'Sirrah, the delay in the fulfilment of this promise has been long, and I shall not find thy morrow regarding it other than thy to-day, or</p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_176"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 176</font></a></p>  
 <p>thy to-day concerning it other than thy yesterday. In promise breaking, I can only compare thee to the Salix Aegyptia tree whose blossoms fill the eye, but there is no fruit there.'</p>  
 <p>Said ‘Ísá ibn Hishám: When he had reached this point, <a name="fr_1039"></a><a href="#fn_1039"><font size="1">1</font></a> I cut him short and said: 'God guard thee, art thou not al-Iskanderí?' He answered: 'And perpetual may thy preservation be, how excellent is thy sagacity!' Then I said: 'Welcome to the commander of speech and to the stray of the generous. <a name="fr_1040"></a><a href="#fn_1040"><font size="1">2</font></a> I have searched for it till I found it, and sought it till I obtained it.' Then we became mutually friendly till the highland attracted me and the lowland swallowed him. I ascended and he descended, and I fared eastwards and he westwards. After his departure, I said:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir>'O would that I knew of a brother <a name="fr_1041"></a><a href="#fn_1041"><font size="1">3</font></a> whose hands were straitened, but whose fame was extensive:<br> Last night he passed with me, but where will he pass this our night?<br> May poverty not prosper, <a name="fr_1042"></a><a href="#fn_1042"><font size="1">4</font></a> for he is its exile, and, owing to poverty, I have been deprived of him.<br> I will surely place over it, in Khalaf ibn Aḥmad, one who will destroy it.'</dir>
