 <p>‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: In my early youth I happened to have an equable temperament and accurate judgement, and so I held the balances of my reason even and counterbalanced my seriousness with my jesting. And I adopted some friends for love and others for pleasure. I set apart the day for the people and the night for the wine-cup. He said: 'Now one night there assembled with me some familiar friends, masters of pleasant ideas, and we ceased not to hand one another the stars of the drinking-bowls <a name="fr_1051"></a><a href="#fn_1051"><font size="1">1</font></a> until the wine we had was exhausted.'</p>  
 <p>He said: 'The boon-companions were unanimous in their decision to broach the wine vats, and we drew forth their contents <a name="fr_1052"></a><a href="#fn_1052"><font size="1">2</font></a> and they remained like the shell without the pearl, or a country without a free-born man.' He said: 'When we felt the effect of that our predicament, mischievous inclinations led us to the inn of the female vintner. The brocade of night was green and its waves were tumultuous. Now when we had begun to wade along, the crier of the morning <a name="fr_1053"></a><a href="#fn_1053"><font size="1">3</font></a> chanted the summons to prayer and so the fiend of youthful lust shrank back, <a name="fr_1054"></a><a href="#fn_1054"><font size="1">4</font></a> and we hastened</p>

 <p>forward to obey the call, and stood behind the Imam with the standing of the noble pious, with dignity, sedateness, and measured movements. For every commodity hath its time and every craft its place.</p>  
 <p>Now our Imam was energetic in his bending and rising, and by his delay was inviting us to slap him, till he came to his senses and raised his voice to pronounce the final salutation. Then he sat cross-legged at a side of the niche, turned his face towards his audience, <a name="fr_1055"></a><a href="#fn_1055"><font size="1">1</font></a> looking down for a long time and snuffed the air continually. Then he said: 'O people, he who has rendered his conduct unseemly, and is afflicted with his foul behaviour, should remain at home, <a name="fr_1056"></a><a href="#fn_1056"><font size="1">2</font></a> instead of polluting us with his breath, for verily all this day I have perceived the fumes <a name="fr_1057"></a><a href="#fn_1057"><font size="1">3</font></a> of the mother of enormities <a name="fr_1058"></a><a href="#fn_1058"><font size="1">4</font></a> from some of the people. Now what is the desert of him who has passed the night prostrated by the influence of Ṭaghút <a name="fr_1059"></a><a href="#fn_1059"><font size="1">5</font></a> a and then comes betimes to these houses <a name="fr_1060"></a><a href="#fn_1060"><font size="1">6</font></a> which God hath commanded to be raised, and hath purposed</p>

 <p>that the last of these should be cut off?' <a name="fr_1061"></a><a href="#fn_1061"><font size="1">1</font></a>--and he pointed to us. Then was the congregation incited against us, and they fell upon us till our outer-wrapper garments were torn to tatters, the napes of our necks were covered with blood, and we vowed to them we would not revert to it. Then we escaped from among them with difficulty, but, owing to our escaping safely, <a name="fr_1062"></a><a href="#fn_1062"><font size="1">2</font></a> we all forgave such a calamity. <a name="fr_1063"></a><a href="#fn_1063"><font size="1">3</font></a> We enquired of the children that passed by us concerning the Imám of that village and they said: 'It is the godly man Abú’l Fatḥ, al-Iskanderí.' So we exclaimed: 'Good gracious, occasionally a blind man receives his sight and a demon believes! And praise God! he has hastened in turning to Him and may God not deprive us of repentance like his.' And we passed the remainder of our day marvelling at his devotion in spite of what we knew of his immorality. He said: 'Now when the day was, or almost was, in its death throes, we beheld and lo! there were the banners of the wine-shops <a name="fr_1064"></a><a href="#fn_1064"><font size="1">4</font></a> like stars in a pitch-dark night. At the sight of them we exchanged gifts of gladness, announced to one another the glad tidings of a brilliant night, and arrived at the one with the biggest door and the stoutest dogs. And we made the dinar our leader and recklessness a thing inseparable from us. We were conducted to the possessor of a beautiful form, dalliance, and a slender waist,--when her glances killed, her words made alive again. She received us well and hastened to kiss our heads and hands while her aliens <a name="fr_1065"></a><a href="#fn_1065"><font size="1">5</font></a> hurried to unsaddle the camels and the horses.' Then we asked her concerning her wine and she said:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir>'Wine, in sweetness, <a name="fr_1066"></a><a href="#fn_1066"><font size="1">6</font></a> deliciousness and pleasantness, like the dew of my mouth,</dir>  
 <p>
 </p>

 <p><a name="page_181"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 181</font></a></p>  
 <p></p><dir>It leaves the clement one without the smallest quantity of the grace of his clemency.'</dir>  
 <p>It is as if my grandfather's ancestors had pressed it from my cheek and coated it with pitch <a name="fr_1067"></a><a href="#fn_1067"><font size="1">1</font></a> like unto my separation and aversion; the trust of the ages, the hidden thing in the bosom of happiness. The righteous have not ceased to inherit it and the nights and the days to take away from it, until nought remaineth save aroma, rays, and a pungent flavour. It is the fragrance of the soul, the fellow-spouse of the sun, <a name="fr_1068"></a><a href="#fn_1068"><font size="1">2</font></a> the damsel of the lightning, a coaxing old dame. It is like the heat in the veins and the coolness of the gentle breeze in the throats, the illumination of thought and the antidote <a name="fr_1069"></a><a href="#fn_1069"><font size="1">3</font></a> to the poison of the age. With the like of it the dead is strengthened and raised to life again, and the one born blind is treated so that he sees. So we said: 'By thy father this is the stray! And who is the minstrel at thy court? Perhaps it is diluted for the drinkers with the sweet dew of thy mouth?' She said: 'Verily, I have an old man of pleasant disposition and rare humour. He met me on Sunday at the convent of Mirbad. He spoke to me confidentially till he pleased me, and so a friendship sprang up and joy recurred. He told me of his great honour, and of the nobility of his people in his own country that which directed my love to him, and made him a favourite, and you will soon make friends with, and have a longing for him.' He said: 'Then she called her old man, and lo! it was our Iskanderí, Abú’l-Fatḥ!' So I said: 'O Abú’l-Fatḥ! By heavens, it is as though he who recited <i>these lines</i> had looked upon thee and spoken with thy tongue:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir>'In times gone by, <a name="fr_1070"></a><a href="#fn_1070"><font size="1">4</font></a> I had wisdom, religion and uprightness,<br> Then praise God! we sold jurisprudence for the craft of the cupper.<br> And, if we live but a little longer, God save us.'</dir>

 <p>He said: 'Then he snorted as snorts the vain, he shouted, he grinned and laughed immoderately and then he said: "Is it said of the likes of me, is one like me proverbially spoken of?"'</p>  
 <p></p><dir>'Cease from blaming, <a name="fr_1071"></a><a href="#fn_1071"><font size="1">1</font></a> but what a deceiver <a name="fr_1072"></a><a href="#fn_1072"><font size="1">2</font></a> thou perceivest me to be!<br> I am he whom every Tahamite and every Yemenite knows,<br> I am of every kind of dust, I am of every place.<br> At one time I cleave to the niche, at another to the location of the wine-shop.<br> And thus acts whoever is wise in this time.'</dir>  
 <p>Said ‘Ísá ibn Hishám: 'I sought refuge with God from the like of his condition, and I marvelled at the holding back <a name="fr_1073"></a><a href="#fn_1073"><font size="1">3</font></a> of subsistence from men of his ilk. We enjoyed that week of ours with him and then we departed from him.'</p>
