 This is a slightly fictionalized account of life in Persia (Iran) in the
 19th century, capped off by a perilous pilgrimage to the Shiite holy city of
 Meshed (Mashhad), in the foothills of the mountains that run up to the
 Zoroastrian Olympus, Damavand.
 The book is a rare collaboration between a turn of the 20th century English and Persian author.
 The narrative method presages the classic
 Oscar Lewis ethnographies of poor Mexican families.
 In both cases, a straightforward account would have been dangerous because
 of the repressive nature of the society being studied.
 This is, on one level, an orientalist conceit of an Englishman writing
 the life story of a (semi-fictional) Persian <i>from the point of view of a Persian</i>.
 However, Sykes manages to pull off this literary feat convincingly, even
 for readers at this later date.
 He also uses the opportunity as a perfect Swiftian setup to gently satire
 European civilization, which adds
 an entire ironic layer to the read.

 This long-out-of-print (and quite rare) book is a delightful read,
 particularly for connoisseurs of travelogues.
 The Shiite, Sufi, Islamic, and Persian lore and legends which are
 described here will be of great interest to folklorists.
 The photographs and other illustrations will 
 be of use to graphic designers, anthropologists and historians.
 This is obviously a primary source on the architecture of the Mashhad
 pilgrimage site.
 Largely unknown to outsiders, this complex has some very
 spectacular (and gorgeous) structures.
 Most of all, this book is an eye-opener for westerners interested in
 the deep culture and history of Iran.
