 <p>Whether it be in Mecca's holiest shrine,<br> Or in the Temple pilgrim feet have trod,<br>     Still Thou art mine,<br> Wherever God is worshipped is my God.</p>  
 <p>The morning I shall greet with tears and sighs,<br> And from my heart that burns with holy fire<br>     A breath shall rise<br> To burnish thus my mirror of desire.</p>

 <p>The world through Islam light in darkness saw<br>    And walked safe guided by thy Scroll of Law,<br>       Bowing to God in hope and holy awe—</p>  
 <p>To God, Who sinners can forgive and lead,<br>    Inscrutable Himself, yet Who can read<br>       The hidden heart and comprehend its need.</p>

 <p>Now tell me what the grain that drew the dove?<br>     The mole it was upon a cheek so fair.<br> Tell me of what was wove the net of love?<br>     The wandering curls of the Belovèd's hair.</p>  
 <p>The festival of love is holden here,<br>     The goblet passes; drink thou of this wine,<br> Yea, drain it to the lees, and never fear<br>     Intoxication that is all divine.</p>

 <p>Could I my foolish heart to ashes burn<br> Then might I rest, my sorrow then might cease;<br> Unto the ocean of Thy love I turn<br>       To find within it peace.</p>  
 <p>I sink within its waters, nor above<br> Its surface can my weary limbs uplift,<br> Deep-drownèd I within the sea of love<br>       Lapped by its waves must drift.</p>

 <p>Come, O ye weak in faith, for help is here,<br> Behold these flashes from our hearts that fly,<br> Had ye the eye of faith they would appear<br> Like the white light that gleamed on Sinai.</p>  
 <p>Come to the feast of love, for it is spread;<br> Share ye the wine-cup where we drink so deep;<br> Behold the wine—the tears that we have shed,<br> The wine-cups are our eyes that ever weep.</p>
