 <p><small>[THIS author was a native of Syria, and died at Miafarakir, in the year of the Hejra 553.]</small></p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">AS drenched in wine, the other night,<br>   Zeid from the banquet sallied,<br> Thus I reproved his drunken plight,<br>   Thus he my prudence rallied:  
 <p>"In beverage so impure and vile<br>   How canst thou thus delight?"<br> "My cups," he answered, with a smile,<br>   "Are generous and bright."</p>  
 <p>"Beware those dangerous draughts," I cried;<br>   "With love the goblet flows."<br> "And cursed is he," the youth replied,<br>   "Who hatred only knows!"</p>  
 <p>"Those cups too soon, with sickness fraught,<br>   Thy stomach shall deplore."<br> "Then soon," he cried, "the noxious draught<br>   And all its ills are o’er."</p>  
 <p>"Rash youth! thy guilty joys resign"—<br>   "I will," at length he said:<br> "I vow I'll bid adieu to wine—<br>   As soon as I am dead!"</p></div>
