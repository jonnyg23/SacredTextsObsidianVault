 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">THE boatmen shout, "’Tis time to part,<br>   No longer we can stay; "<br> ’Twas then Maimuna taught my heart<br>   How much a glance could say.  
 <p>With trembling steps to me she came;<br>   "Farewell," she would have cried,<br> But ere her lips the word could frame,<br>   In half-formed sounds it died.</p>  
 <p>Then bending down, with looks of love,<br>   Her arms she round me flung,<br> And as the gale hangs on the grove,<br>   Upon my breast she hung.</p>  
 <p>My willing arms embraced the maid,<br>   My heart with raptures beat;<br> While she but wept the more and said,<br>   "Would we had never met!"</p></div>
