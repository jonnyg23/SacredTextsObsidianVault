 <h3>201.</h3>
 
 <p>Jesus having entered into the temple, the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery. They said among themselves: 'If he saves her, it is contrary to the law of Moses, and so we have him as guilty, and if he condemn her it is contrary to his own doctrine, for he preacheth mercy.' Wherefore they came to Jesus and said: 'Master, we have found this woman in adultery. Moses commanded that [such] should be stoned: what then sayest thou?'</p>
 
 <p>Thereupon Jesus stooped down and with his finger made a mirror on the ground wherein every one saw his own iniquities. As they still pressed for the answer, Jesus lifted up himself and, pointing to the mirror with his finger, said: 'He that is without sin among you, let him be first to stone her.' And again he stooped down, shaping the mirror.</p>
 
 <p>The men, seeing this, went out one by one, beginning from the eldest, for they were ashamed to see their abominations.</p>
 
 <p>Jesus having lifted up himself, and seeing no one but the woman, said: 'Woman, where are they that condemned thee?'</p>
 
 <p>The woman answered, weeping: 'Lord, they are departed; and if thou wilt pardon me, as God liveth, I will sin no more.'</p>
 
 <p>Then said Jesus: 'Blessed be God! Go thy way in peace and sin no more, for God hath not sent me to condemn thee.'</p>
 
 <p>Then, the scribes and Pharisees being assembled, Jesus said to them: 'Tell me: if one of you had an hundred sheep, and should lose one of them, would ye not go to seek it, leaving the ninety and nine? And when ye found it, would ye not lay it upon your shoulders and, having called together your neighbours, say unto them: "Rejoice with me, for I have found the sheep which I had lost?" Assuredly ye would do so.</p>
 
 <p>'Now tell me, shall our God love less man, for whom he hath made the world? As God liveth, even so there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth; because sinners make known God's mercy.'</p>
