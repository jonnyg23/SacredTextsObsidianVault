 <h1 align="CENTER">75. al-Qiyamah: The Resurrection</h1>
 <a name="an_075_001">1</a> Nay, I swear by the Day of Resurrection; 
 <a name="an_075_002">2</a> Nay, I swear by the accusing soul (that this Scripture is true). 
 <a name="an_075_003">3</a> Thinketh man that We shall not assemble his bones ? 
 <a name="an_075_004">4</a> Yea, verily. We are Able to restore his very fingers! 
 <a name="an_075_005">5</a> But man would fain deny what is before him. 
 <a name="an_075_006">6</a> He asketh: When will be this Day of Resurrection ? 
 <a name="an_075_007">7</a> But when sight is confounded 
 <a name="an_075_008">8</a> And the moon is eclipsed 
 <a name="an_075_009">9</a> And sun and moon are united, 
 <a name="an_075_010">10</a> On that day man will cry: Whither to flee! 
 <a name="an_075_011">11</a> Alas! No refuge! 
 <a name="an_075_012">12</a> Unto thy Lord is the recourse that day. 
 <a name="an_075_013">13</a> On that day man is told the tale of that which he hath sent before and left  behind. 
 <a name="an_075_014">14</a> Oh, but man is a telling witness against himself, 
 <a name="an_075_015">15</a> Although he tender his excuses. 
 <a name="an_075_016">16</a> Stir not thy tongue herewith to hasten it. 
 <a name="an_075_017">17</a> Lo! upon Us (resteth) the putting together thereof and the reading thereof. 
 <a name="an_075_018">18</a> And when We read it, follow thou the reading; 
 <a name="an_075_019">19</a> Then lo! upon Us (resteth) the explanation thereof. 
 <a name="an_075_020">20</a> Nay, but ye do love the fleeting Now 
 <a name="an_075_021">21</a> And neglect the Hereafter. 
 <a name="an_075_022">22</a> That day will faces be resplendent, 
 <a name="an_075_023">23</a> Looking toward their Lord; 
 <a name="an_075_024">24</a> And that day will other faces be despondent, 
 <a name="an_075_025">25</a> Thou wilt know that some great disaster is about to fall on them. 
 <a name="an_075_026">26</a> Nay, but when the life cometh up to the throat 
 <a name="an_075_027">27</a> And men say: Where is the wizard (who can save him now) ? 
 <a name="an_075_028">28</a> And he knoweth that it is the parting; 
 <a name="an_075_029">29</a> And agony is heaped on agony; 
 <a name="an_075_030">30</a> Unto thy Lord that day will be the driving. 
 <a name="an_075_031">31</a> For he neither trusted, nor prayed. 
 <a name="an_075_032">32</a> But he denied and flouted. 
 <a name="an_075_033">33</a> Then went he to his folk with glee. 
 <a name="an_075_034">34</a> Nearer unto thee and nearer, 
 <a name="an_075_035">35</a> Again nearer unto thee and nearer (is the doom). 
 <a name="an_075_036">36</a> Thinketh man that he is to be left aimless ? 
 <a name="an_075_037">37</a> Was he not a drop of fluid which gushed forth ? 
 <a name="an_075_038">38</a> Then he became a clot; then (Allah) shaped and fashioned 
 <a name="an_075_039">39</a> And made of him a pair, the male and female. 
 <a name="an_075_040">40</a> Is not He (Who doeth so) Able to bring the dead to life ?
