 <h1 align="CENTER">67. al-Mulk: The Kingdom</h1>
 <a name="an_067_001">1</a> Blessed is He in Whose hand is the Sovereignty, and, He is Able to do all  things. 
 <a name="an_067_002">2</a> Who hath created life and death that He may try you which of you is best in  conduct; and He is the Mighty, the Forgiving, 
 <a name="an_067_003">3</a> Who hath created seven heavens in harmony. Thou (Muhammad) canst see  no fault in the Beneficent One's creation; then look again: Canst thou see any rifts ? 
 <a name="an_067_004">4</a> Then look again and yet again, thy sight will return unto thee weakened and  made dim. 
 <a name="an_067_005">5</a> And verily We have beautified the world's heaven with lamps, and We have  made them missiles for the devils, and for them We have prepared the doom of flame. 
 <a name="an_067_006">6</a> And for those who disbelieve in their Lord there is the doom of hell, a  hapless journey's end! 
 <a name="an_067_007">7</a> When they are flung therein they hear its roaring as it boileth up, 
 <a name="an_067_008">8</a> As it would burst with rage. Whenever a (fresh) host is flung therein the  wardens thereof ask them: Came there unto you no warner ? 
 <a name="an_067_009">9</a> They say: Yea, verily, a warner came unto us; but we denied and said: Allah  hath naught revealed; ye are in naught but a great error. 
 <a name="an_067_010">10</a> And they say: Had we been wont to listen or have sense, we had not been  among the dwellers in the flames. 
 <a name="an_067_011">11</a> So they acknowledge their sins; but far removed (from mercy) are the  dwellers in the flames. 
 <a name="an_067_012">12</a> Lo! those who fear their Lord in secret, theirs will be forgiveness and a great  reward. 
 <a name="an_067_013">13</a> And keep your opinion secret or proclaim it, lo! He is Knower of all that is in  the breasts (of men). 
 <a name="an_067_014">14</a> Should He not know what He created ? And He is the Subtile, the Aware. 
 <a name="an_067_015">15</a> He it is Who hath made the earth subservient unto you, so Walk in the paths  thereof and eat of His providence. And unto Him will be the resurrection (of the  dead). 
 <a name="an_067_016">16</a> Have ye taken security from Him Who is in the heaven that He will not cause  the earth to swallow you when lo! it is convulsed ? 
 <a name="an_067_017">17</a> Or have ye taken security from Him Who is in the heaven that He will not let  loose on you a hurricane ? But ye shall know the manner of My warning. 
 <a name="an_067_018">18</a> And verily those before them denied, then (see) the manner of My wrath  (with them)! 
 <a name="an_067_019">19</a> Have they not seen the birds above them spreading out their wings and  closing them ? Naught upholdeth them save the Beneficent. Lo! He is Seer of all  things. 
 <a name="an_067_020">20</a> Or who is he that will be an army unto you to help you instead of the  Beneficent ? The disbelievers are in naught but illusion. 
 <a name="an_067_021">21</a> Or who is he that will provide for you if He should withhold His providence  ? Nay, but they are set in pride and frowardness. 
 <a name="an_067_022">22</a> Is he who goeth groping on his face more rightly guided, or he who walketh  upright on a straight road ? 
 <a name="an_067_023">23</a> Say (unto them, O Muhammad): He it is who gave you being, and hath  assigned unto you ears and eyes and hearts. Small thanks give ye! 
 <a name="an_067_024">24</a> Say: He it is Who multiplieth you in the earth, and unto Whom ye will be  gathered. 
 <a name="an_067_025">25</a> And they say: When (will) this promise (be fulfilled), if ye are truthful ? 
 <a name="an_067_026">26</a> Say: The knowledge is with Allah only, and I am but a plain warner; 
 <a name="an_067_027">27</a> But when they see it nigh, the faces of those who disbelieve will be awry,  and it will be said (unto them): This is that for which ye used to call. 
 <a name="an_067_028">28</a> Say (O Muhammad): Have ye thought: Whether Allah causeth me  (Muhammad) and those with me to perish or hath mercy on us, still, who will protect  the disbelievers from a painful doom ? 
 <a name="an_067_029">29</a> Say: He is the Beneficent. In Him we believe and in Him we put our trust.  And ye will soon know who it is that is in error manifest. 
 <a name="an_067_030">30</a> Say: Have ye thought: If (all) your water were to disappear into the earth,  who then could bring you gushing water ?
