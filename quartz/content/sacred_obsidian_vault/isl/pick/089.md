 <h1 align="CENTER">89. al-Fajr: The Dawn</h1>
 <a name="an_089_001">1</a> By the Dawn 
 <a name="an_089_002">2</a> And ten nights, 
 <a name="an_089_003">3</a> And the Even and the Odd, 
 <a name="an_089_004">4</a> And the night when it departeth, 
 <a name="an_089_005">5</a> There surely is an oath for thinking man. 
 <a name="an_089_006">6</a> Dost thou not consider how thy Lord dealt with (the tribe of) A'ad, 
 <a name="an_089_007">7</a> With many-columned Iram, 
 <a name="an_089_008">8</a> The like of which was not created in the lands; 
 <a name="an_089_009">9</a> And with (the tribe of) Thamud, who clove the rocks in the valley; 
 <a name="an_089_010">10</a> And with Pharaoh, firm of might, 
 <a name="an_089_011">11</a> Who (all) were rebellious (to Allah) in these lands, 
 <a name="an_089_012">12</a> And multiplied iniquity therein ? 
 <a name="an_089_013">13</a> Therefore thy Lord poured on them the disaster of His punishment. 
 <a name="an_089_014">14</a> Lo! thy Lord is ever watchful. 
 <a name="an_089_015">15</a> As for man, whenever his Lord trieth him by honouring him, and is gracious  unto him, he saith: My Lord honoureth me. 
 <a name="an_089_016">16</a> But whenever He trieth him by straitening his means of life, he saith: My  Lord despiseth me. 
 <a name="an_089_017">17</a> Nay, but ye (for your part) honour not the orphan 
 <a name="an_089_018">18</a> And urge not on the feeding of the poor. 
 <a name="an_089_019">19</a> And ye devour heritages with devouring greed. 
 <a name="an_089_020">20</a> And love wealth with abounding love. 
 <a name="an_089_021">21</a> Nay, but when the earth is ground to atoms, grinding, grinding, 
 <a name="an_089_022">22</a> And thy Lord shall come with angels, rank on rank, 
 <a name="an_089_023">23</a> And hell is brought near that day; on that day man will remember, but how  will the remembrance (then avail him) ? 
 <a name="an_089_024">24</a> He will say: Ah, would that I had sent before me (some provision) for my  life! 
 <a name="an_089_025">25</a> None punisheth as He will punish on that day! 
 <a name="an_089_026">26</a> None bindeth as He then will bind. 
 <a name="an_089_027">27</a> But ah! thou soul at peace! 
 <a name="an_089_028">28</a> Return unto thy Lord, content in His good pleasure! 
 <a name="an_089_029">29</a> Enter thou among My bondmen! 
 <a name="an_089_030">30</a> Enter thou My Garden!
