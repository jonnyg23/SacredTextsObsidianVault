 <h1 align="CENTER">44. ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke</h1>
 <a name="an_044_001">1</a> Ha. Mim. 
 <a name="an_044_002">2</a> By the Scripture that maketh plain 
 <a name="an_044_003">3</a> Lo! We revealed it on a blessed night - Lo! We are ever warning - 
 <a name="an_044_004">4</a> Whereon every wise command is made clear 
 <a name="an_044_005">5</a> As a command from Our presence - Lo! We are ever sending - 
 <a name="an_044_006">6</a> A mercy from thy Lord. Lo! He, even He is the Hearer, the Knower, 
 <a name="an_044_007">7</a> Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, if ye would  be sure. 
 <a name="an_044_008">8</a> There is no God save Him. He quickeneth and giveth death; your Lord and  Lord of your forefathers. 
 <a name="an_044_009">9</a> Nay, but they play in doubt. 
 <a name="an_044_010">10</a> But watch thou (O Muhammad) for the day when the sky will produce  visible smoke 
 <a name="an_044_011">11</a> That will envelop the people. This will be a painful torment. 
 <a name="an_044_012">12</a> (Then they will say): Our Lord relieve us of the torment. Lo! we are  believers. 
 <a name="an_044_013">13</a> How can there be remembrance for them, when a messenger making plain  (the Truth) had already come unto them, 
 <a name="an_044_014">14</a> And they had turned away from him and said: One taught (by others), a  madman ? 
 <a name="an_044_015">15</a> Lo! We withdraw the torment a little. Lo! ye return (to disbelief). 
 <a name="an_044_016">16</a> On the day when We shall seize them with the greater seizure, (then) in truth  We shall punish. 
 <a name="an_044_017">17</a> And verily We tried before them Pharaoh's folk, when there came unto them  a noble messenger, 
 <a name="an_044_018">18</a> Saying: Give up to me the slaves of Allah. Lo! I am a faithful messenger  unto you. 
 <a name="an_044_019">19</a> And saying: Be not proud against Allah. Lo! I bring you a clear warrant. 
 <a name="an_044_020">20</a> And lo! I have sought refuge in my Lord and your Lord lest ye stone me to  death. 
 <a name="an_044_021">21</a> And if ye put no faith in me, then let me go. 
 <a name="an_044_022">22</a> And he cried unto his Lord, (saying): These are guilty folk. 
 <a name="an_044_023">23</a> Then (his Lord commanded): Take away My slaves by night. Lo! ye will be  followed, 
 <a name="an_044_024">24</a> And leave the sea behind at rest, for lo! they are a drowned host. 
 <a name="an_044_025">25</a> How many were the gardens and the watersprings that they left behind, 
 <a name="an_044_026">26</a> And the cornlands and the goodly sites 
 <a name="an_044_027">27</a> And pleasant things wherein they took delight! 
 <a name="an_044_028">28</a> Even so (it was), and We made it an inheritance for other folk; 
 <a name="an_044_029">29</a> And the heaven and the earth wept not for them, nor were they reprieved. 
 <a name="an_044_030">30</a> And We delivered the Children of Israel from the shameful doom; 
 <a name="an_044_031">31</a> (We delivered them) from Pharaoh. Lo! he was a tyrant of the wanton ones. 
 <a name="an_044_032">32</a> And We chose them, purposely, above (all) creatures. 
 <a name="an_044_033">33</a> And We gave them portents wherein was a clear trial. 
 <a name="an_044_034">34</a> Lo! these, forsooth, are saying: 
 <a name="an_044_035">35</a> There is naught but our first death, and we shall not be raised again. 
 <a name="an_044_036">36</a> Bring back our fathers, if ye speak the truth! 
 <a name="an_044_037">37</a> Are they better, or the folk of Tubb'a and those before them ? We destroyed  them, for surely they were guilty. 
 <a name="an_044_038">38</a> And We created not the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them,  in play. 
 <a name="an_044_039">39</a> We created them not save with truth; but most of them know not. 
 <a name="an_044_040">40</a> Assuredly the Day of Decision is the term for all of them, 
 <a name="an_044_041">41</a> A day when friend can in naught avail friend, nor can they be helped, 
 <a name="an_044_042">42</a> Save him on whom Allah hath mercy. Lo! He is the Mighty, the Merciful. 
 <a name="an_044_043">43</a> Lo! the tree of Zaqqum, 
 <a name="an_044_044">44</a> The food of the sinner! 
 <a name="an_044_045">45</a> Like molten brass, it seetheth in their bellies 
 <a name="an_044_046">46</a> As the seething of boiling water. 
 <a name="an_044_047">47</a> (And it will be said): Take him and drag him to the midst of hell, 
 <a name="an_044_048">48</a> Then pour upon his head the torment of boiling water. 
 <a name="an_044_049">49</a> (Saying): Taste! Lo! thou wast forsooth the mighty, the noble! 
 <a name="an_044_050">50</a> Lo! this is that whereof ye used to doubt. 
 <a name="an_044_051">51</a> Lo! those who kept their duty will be in a place secured. 
 <a name="an_044_052">52</a> Amid gardens and watersprings, 
 <a name="an_044_053">53</a> Attired in silk and silk embroidery, facing one another. 
 <a name="an_044_054">54</a> Even so (it will be). And We shall wed them unto fair ones with wide, lovely  eyes. 
 <a name="an_044_055">55</a> They call therein for every fruit in safety. 
 <a name="an_044_056">56</a> They taste not death therein, save the first death. And He hath saved them  from the doom of hell, 
 <a name="an_044_057">57</a> A bounty from thy Lord. That is the supreme triumph. 
 <a name="an_044_058">58</a> And We have made (this Scripture) easy in thy language only that they may  heed. 
 <a name="an_044_059">59</a> Wait then (O Muhammad). Lo! they (too) are waiting.
