 <h1 align="CENTER">76. ad-Dahr: The Man</h1>
 <a name="an_076_001">1</a> Hath there come upon man (ever) any period of time in which he was a thing  unremembered ? 
 <a name="an_076_002">2</a> Lo! We create man from a drop of thickened fluid to test him; so We make  him hearing, knowing. 
 <a name="an_076_003">3</a> Lo! We have shown him the way, whether he be grateful or disbelieving. 
 <a name="an_076_004">4</a> Lo! We have prepared for disbelievers manacles and carcans and a raging  fire. 
 <a name="an_076_005">5</a> Lo! the righteous shall drink of a cup whereof the mixture is of Kafur, 
 <a name="an_076_006">6</a> A spring wherefrom the slaves of Allah drink, making it gush forth  abundantly, 
 <a name="an_076_007">7</a> (Because) they perform the vow and fear a day whereof the evil is wide- spreading, 
 <a name="an_076_008">8</a> And feed with food the needy wretch, the orphan and the prisoner, for love  of Him, 
 <a name="an_076_009">9</a> (Saying): We feed you, for the sake of Allah only. We wish for no reward  nor thanks from you; 
 <a name="an_076_010">10</a> Lo! we fear from our Lord a day of frowning and of fate. 
 <a name="an_076_011">11</a> Therefor Allah hath warded off from them the evil of that day, and hath  made them find brightness and joy; 
 <a name="an_076_012">12</a> And hath awarded them for all that they endured, a Garden and silk attire; 
 <a name="an_076_013">13</a> Reclining therein upon couches, they will find there neither (heat of) a sun  nor bitter cold. 
 <a name="an_076_014">14</a> The shade thereof is close upon them and the clustered fruits thereof bow  down. 
 <a name="an_076_015">15</a> Goblets of silver are brought round for them, and beakers (as) of glass 
 <a name="an_076_016">16</a> (Bright as) glass but (made) of silver, which they (themselves) have  measured to the measure (of their deeds). 
 <a name="an_076_017">17</a> There are they watered with a cup whereof the mixture is of Zanjabil, 
 <a name="an_076_018">18</a> (The water of) a spring therein, named Salsabil. 
 <a name="an_076_019">19</a> There wait on them immortal youths, whom, when thou seest, thou wouldst  take for scattered pearls. 
 <a name="an_076_020">20</a> When thou seest, thou wilt see there bliss and high estate. 
 <a name="an_076_021">21</a> Their raiment will be fine green silk and gold embroidery. Bracelets of silver  will they wear. Their Lord will slake their thirst with a pure drink. 
 <a name="an_076_022">22</a> (And it will be said unto them): Lo! this is a reward for you. Your endeavour  (upon earth) hath found acceptance. 
 <a name="an_076_023">23</a> Lo! We, even We, have revealed unto thee the Qur'an, a revelation; 
 <a name="an_076_024">24</a> So submit patiently to thy Lord's command, and obey not of them any guilty  one or disbeliever. 
 <a name="an_076_025">25</a> Remember the name of thy Lord at morn and evening. 
 <a name="an_076_026">26</a> And worship Him (a portion) of the night. And glorify Him through the  livelong night. 
 <a name="an_076_027">27</a> Lo! these love fleeting life, and put behind them (the remembrance of) a  grievous day. 
 <a name="an_076_028">28</a> We, even We, created them, and strengthened their frame. And when We  will, We can replace them, bringing others like them in their stead. 
 <a name="an_076_029">29</a> Lo! this is an Admonishment, that whosoever will may choose a way unto  his Lord. 
 <a name="an_076_030">30</a> Yet ye will not, unless Allah willeth. Lo! Allah is Knower, Wise. 
 <a name="an_076_031">31</a> He maketh whom He will to enter His mercy, and for evil-doers hath  prepared a painful doom.
