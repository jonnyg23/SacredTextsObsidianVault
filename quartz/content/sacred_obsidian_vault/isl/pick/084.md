 <h1 align="CENTER">84. al-Inshiqaq: The Rending</h1>
 <a name="an_084_001">1</a> When the heaven is split asunder 
 <a name="an_084_002">2</a> And attentive to her Lord in fear, 
 <a name="an_084_003">3</a> And when the earth is spread out 
 <a name="an_084_004">4</a> And hath cast out all that was in her, and is empty 
 <a name="an_084_005">5</a> And attentive to her Lord in fear! 
 <a name="an_084_006">6</a> Thou, verily, O man, art working toward thy Lord a work which thou wilt  meet (in His presence). 
 <a name="an_084_007">7</a> Then whoso is given his account in his right hand 
 <a name="an_084_008">8</a> He truly will receive an easy reckoning 
 <a name="an_084_009">9</a> And will return unto his folk in joy. 
 <a name="an_084_010">10</a> But whoso is given his account behind his back, 
 <a name="an_084_011">11</a> He surely will invoke destruction 
 <a name="an_084_012">12</a> And be thrown to scorching fire. 
 <a name="an_084_013">13</a> He verily lived joyous with his folk, 
 <a name="an_084_014">14</a> He verily deemed that he would never return (unto Allah). 
 <a name="an_084_015">15</a> Nay, but lo! his Lord is ever looking on him! 
 <a name="an_084_016">16</a> Oh, I swear by the afterglow of sunset, 
 <a name="an_084_017">17</a> And by the night and all that it enshroudeth, 
 <a name="an_084_018">18</a> And by the moon when she is at the full, 
 <a name="an_084_019">19</a> That ye shall journey on from plane to plane. 
 <a name="an_084_020">20</a> What aileth them, then, that they believe not 
 <a name="an_084_021">21</a> And, when the Qur'an is recited unto them, worship not (Allah) ? 
 <a name="an_084_022">22</a> Nay, but those who disbelieve will deny; 
 <a name="an_084_023">23</a> And Allah knoweth best what they are hiding. 
 <a name="an_084_024">24</a> So give them tidings of a painful doom, 
 <a name="an_084_025">25</a> Save those who believe and do good works, for theirs is a reward unfailing.
