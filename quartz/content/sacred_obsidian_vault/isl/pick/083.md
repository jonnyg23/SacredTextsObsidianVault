 <h1 align="CENTER">83. at-Tatfif: The Defrauders</h1>
 <a name="an_083_001">1</a> Woe unto the defrauders: 
 <a name="an_083_002">2</a> Those who when they take the measure from mankind demand it full, 
 <a name="an_083_003">3</a> But if they measure unto them or weight for them, they cause them loss. 
 <a name="an_083_004">4</a> Do such (men) not consider that they will be raised again 
 <a name="an_083_005">5</a> Unto an Awful Day, 
 <a name="an_083_006">6</a> The day when (all) mankind stand before the Lord of the Worlds ? 
 <a name="an_083_007">7</a> Nay, but the record of the vile is in Sijjin - 
 <a name="an_083_008">8</a> Ah! what will convey unto thee what Sijjin is! - 
 <a name="an_083_009">9</a> A written record. 
 <a name="an_083_010">10</a> Woe unto the repudiators on that day! 
 <a name="an_083_011">11</a> Those who deny the Day of Judgment 
 <a name="an_083_012">12</a> Which none denieth save each criminal transgressor, 
 <a name="an_083_013">13</a> Who, when thou readest unto him Our revelations, saith: (Mere) fables of the  men of old. 
 <a name="an_083_014">14</a> Nay, but that which they have earned is rust upon their hearts. 
 <a name="an_083_015">15</a> Nay, but surely on that day they will be covered from (the mercy of) their  Lord. 
 <a name="an_083_016">16</a> Then lo! they verily will burn in hell, 
 <a name="an_083_017">17</a> And it will be said (unto them): This is that which ye used to deny. 
 <a name="an_083_018">18</a> Nay, but the record of the righteous is in 'Illiyin - 
 <a name="an_083_019">19</a> Ah, what will convey unto thee what 'Illiyin is! - 
 <a name="an_083_020">20</a> A written record, 
 <a name="an_083_021">21</a> Attested by those who are brought near (unto their Lord). 
 <a name="an_083_022">22</a> Lo! the righteous verily are in delight, 
 <a name="an_083_023">23</a> On couches, gazing, 
 <a name="an_083_024">24</a> Thou wilt know in their faces the radiance of delight. 
 <a name="an_083_025">25</a> They are given to drink of a pure wine, sealed, 
 <a name="an_083_026">26</a> Whose seal is musk - for this let (all) those strive who strive for bliss - 
 <a name="an_083_027">27</a> And mixed with water of Tasnim, 
 <a name="an_083_028">28</a> A spring whence those brought near (to Allah) drink. 
 <a name="an_083_029">29</a> Lo! the guilty used to laugh at those who believed, 
 <a name="an_083_030">30</a> And wink one to another when they passed them; 
 <a name="an_083_031">31</a> And when they returned to their own folk, they returned jesting; 
 <a name="an_083_032">32</a> And when they saw them they said: Lo! these have gone astray. 
 <a name="an_083_033">33</a> Yet they were not sent as guardians over them. 
 <a name="an_083_034">34</a> This day it is those who believe who have the laugh of disbelievers, 
 <a name="an_083_035">35</a> On high couches, gazing. 
 <a name="an_083_036">36</a> Are not the disbelievers paid for what they used to do ?
