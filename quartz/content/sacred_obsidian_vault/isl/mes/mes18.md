 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">A certain</span> Jewish King, in savage, brutal scenes,<br> From hate of Jesus, persecuted Nazarenes.<br> ’Twas Jesu's age, when he the Gospel first did teach;<br> In Jesus, Moses, and in Moses, Jesus preach.</p>  
 <p>That King God made squint-eyed; things straight he could not see.<br> A King and squint-eyed? Ah! that one the two should be!</p>  
 <p>A master once a squint-eyed slave commanded so:<br> "Come here; that bottle from its shelf, go, fetch me; go."<br> The squint-eye straightway asked: "Which, master, of the two? <a name="fr_81"></a><a href="#fn_80"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> The case explain; clear up the doubt, and truly show." <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_5">5</a></font></span><br> His master answered: "Two there's not; there is but one;<br> Put off thy strabism; with stupidity have done."<br> "Good master," quoth he, "chide me not; ’tis nature's fault."<br> The master quick rejoined: "Look now; break one; halt! halt!"<br> As soon as one was broken, both were gone from sight.<br> Poor squint-eye nearly lost his wits in childish fright.</p>

 <p>There was but one; his eyes were cause that he saw two.<br> The one away, the other consequently was gone too.</p>  
 <p>Desire or rage, at times, makes people double see.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_10">10</a></font></span> The mind's distortion brings the eyes perverse to be.<br> From passion's mists our reason ever blinded lies.<br> The heart its clouds sends up; the mind's eye's vision flies.<br> The judge to taking bribes who basely bends himself,<br> Can never well discern the right and wrong, from pelf.<br> Our King through Israelitish rancour grew so blind,<br> A s nothing to distinguish in his rage of mind.<br> By thousands, faithful seekers of God's will he slew.<br> "Vouchsafe us help, O God of Moses, Jesus too!"</p>  
 <p>He had a Vazīr, brigandlike for craft and force.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_15">15</a></font></span> In knavish stratagems he had no peer; of course.<br> He whispered to the King: "These Christians, as in hives,<br> All keep their faith a mystery, to save their lives.<br> To kill them thus is profitless. Give breathing-time,<br> Religion can't be smelt out just like musk or thyme.<br> A secret ’tis, well wrapped in many folds of guile.<br> In outward show, as friends, perfidiously they smile."<br> The King, with grimace fierce: "What have we then to do?<br> What remedy proposest thou to make them rue?<br> I will not leave alive one Christian in the land,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20">20</a></font></span> Whose faith is shown to all, or in his bosom banned."</p>  
 <p>The Vazīr to him: "King, my hands and ears cut off;<br> My nose and lips the same. Give orders; let them scoff.<br> Unto the gallows send me; I'll of all be seen.<br> Then let an intercessor plead,—some prince,—your queen.<br> Let all this happen where some spacious public place<br> May let all see, that all may know of my disgrace.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_m27"><font size="1" color="green">p. 27</font></a></p>  
 <p>Then drive me forth; away from thee in exile sent;<br> And they'll receive me, under feint of sorrow bent.<br> 'In secret,' I'll pretend, 'a Christian I'm at heart;<br> Call God to witness how my faith has worked my hurt. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_25">25</a></font></span><br> The King a knowledge gained of zeal in me that burned;<br> Its flame to put out quite, his anger on me turned.<br> I strove to hide my faith, my leaning to keep hid;<br> Affected still to be, think, act, just as he bid.<br> Suspicion crossed his mind; my secret he espied;<br> All I could plead for nothing went; he said I lied.<br> "Thy specious words," quoth he, "are needles in a loaf; <a name="fr_82"></a><a href="#fn_81"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> My eye, as through a glass, sees all thy thoughts; thou oaf!<br> No curtain of thy trickeries can veil thy faith from me;<br> I'm proof against thy knaveries; thy cunning I can see." <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_30">30</a></font></span><br> Were not the faith of Jesus the refuge of my heart,<br> He'd not have mutilated me in this sad sort.<br> For love of Jesus, head and life I will lay down;<br> All persecution suffer to gain a martyr's crown.<br> My life I will not grudge to lose for Jesus’ sake.<br> His faith I hold from point to point without mistake.<br> I dread his doctrine's fall to uninstructed guides.<br> The truth from their bad teaching still to ruin glides.<br> Thanks be to God, to Jesus thanks, who me have made<br> A teacher perfect of the faith so free from shade. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_35">35</a></font></span><br> The Jew and Judaism I have forsworn in sooth;<br> About my loins the sacred cord <a name="fr_83"></a><a href="#fn_82"><font size="1">2</font></a> I wear; ’tis truth.<br> This age the age of Jesus is; O men, give ear!<br> His doctrine take to heart; nought else have you to fear."</p>  
 <p>The Vazīr having laid this plot before the King,<br> All shame and scruple vanished; ’twas a perfect thing.</p>

 <p>In presence of the public, nose, ears were cut off.<br> The rabble wondered greatly; now's the time to scoff.<br> He fled unto the Christians; begged them him to hear;<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_40">40</a></font></span> And straightway set up preaching; saintlike was he there.</p>  
 <p>The Christians soon with one accord accepted him,<br> In multitudes they round him flocked, all meek and prim.<br> The Gospel's holy words, the prayer, the cord, he'd preach;<br> The mysteries of all of these to them he'd teach.<br> To outward view a guide to sanctity was he;<br> In very truth, a trap and fowler's whistle; see.<br> Of such effect his wiles, disciples were deceived;<br> From Jesu's teaching fell, and in this cheat believed.<br> It is so. Often does the flesh, for selfish end,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_45">45</a></font></span> Intrude itself across the soul's most fervent trend.<br> Meek virtue was not what they sought to gain the most;<br> Of him they learned to ferret out new sins, and boast.<br> Hair-splitting casuists, point by point they sin dissect;<br> They grow too wise; ’twixt rose and garlic links detect.<br> Of such avail's the subtle cunning of these men,<br> That honest teachers oft are made to swerve by them.</p>  
 <p>The Christian folk in him their confidence thus place.<br> Gregarious, like sheep, ’s the mob of every race.<br> A gen’ral favourite was he; all loved him well;<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_50">50</a></font></span> Christ's vicar called they him; as who the truth could tell.<br> This cursed Antichrist, so full of fraud and wile!<br> Grant help, O God! ’Tis Thou alone canst curb such guile.<br> The devil's snares are spread abroad in tempting guise,<br> Their baits are various; we, like birds, shut fast our eyes.<br> If saved from one, another tempts; we thither stray;<br> Like hawks and eagles, heinous sins make us their prey.<br> Thou shieldest us, O gracious God! But ever still,<br> With froward hearts and minds we counteract Thy will.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_m29"><font size="1" color="green">p. 29</font></a></p>  
 <p>This world's a granary, of which we steal the corn.<br> The wheat is there all garnered; we it spoil in scorn. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_55">55</a></font></span><br> We take no heed of future life in what we do;<br> Sly mice still help us to consume the fruits that grow,<br> Those mice a road have found to reach our winter store.<br> Through their inroads our victual spoils; it is no more.<br> First stop mouse-holes; make safe thy granary, O man!<br> Thy wheat then garner safely; winter's at our van.</p>  
 <p>Give ear to what he's said, the Lord's own Chief of Chiefs: <a name="fr_84"></a><a href="#fn_83"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> "No perfect worship's needed, save in war's reliefs." <a name="fr_85"></a><a href="#fn_84"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> If mice there be not to destroy our garnered meeds,<br> Where is our wheat, the fruit of fifty summers’ deeds? <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_60">60</a></font></span><br> To shreds all nibbled lie the products of our days;<br> No stores accumulate for provend on our ways.</p>  
 <p>How many sparks of fire from flint and steel have flown!<br> How many hearts, like tinder, make those sparks their own!<br> But in the dark some thief his finger presses there;<br> And ev’ry train puts out that has been lighted here.<br> Extinguished if those sparks were not, a flame would rise;<br> A burning light be kindled, flashing ’yond the skies.<br> A thousand snares are laid to catch our tripping feet;<br> But, Lord, if us Thou shield, harm never shall us meet. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_65">65</a></font></span><br> If but Thy grace will guide us, lead us on our way,<br> No thief can steal our peace of mind, our light of day.</p>  
 <p>Each night Thou settest free the soul from trap of flesh,<br> To scan and learn the hidden records of Thy wish. <a name="fr_86"></a><a href="#fn_85"><font size="1">3</font></a><br> Each night the soul is like a bird from cage set free,<br> To wander. Judge and judgment, then, it does not see.<br> By night the pris’ner loses sense of bars, of chains;<br> By night the monarch knows no state, no pomp retains;</p>

You'll never see me more,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_335">335</a></font></span> My journey's unto heaven; there I've laid my store.<br> Th’ empyrean beneath, so long as I have strayed,<br> Like firewood in a furnace have I wept; still prayed.<br> Henceforward I shall sit on Jesu's own right hand,<br> In highest heaven enthroned, blest Paradise's strand."</p>  
 <p>The legion-captains now he called to him apart;<br> But one by one, in secret, counsels to impart.<br> To ev’ry one he said: "Successor thee I name,<br> The faith of Jesus to uphold and keep from shame.<br> All other captains thy commands will have to hear;<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_340">340</a></font></span> ’Tis Jesus thus appoints thee others’ loads to bear.<br> Should any one against thee neck rebellious raise,<br> Him kill, imprison, or in exile end his days.<br> But while I live divulge not what to thee I've told,<br> Keep secret till my death this charge thou hast to hold.<br> Let no one know till then ’tis thou art chosen out,<br> Proclaim not thou thyself a king or prince devout.<br> Behold this scroll; take, study it; thyself instruct,<br> ’Tis Jesu's doctrine pure; from this His Church construct."</p>  
 <p>Thus one by one their minds prepared were to be chief:<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_345">345</a></font></span> "’Tis thou’rt the chosen one; all else would be a thief."</p>  
 <p><a name="page_m49"><font size="1" color="green">p. 49</font></a></p>  
 <p>He named them each successor; made them so to feel.<br> Whate’er he told to one, to each did he reveal.<br> He gave to each a volume, writ from end to end;<br> No two alike; each different, and hard to blend. <a name="fr_112"></a><a href="#fn_111"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> Their doctrines various, of every changing hue;<br> Diverse in sense, as objects' forms exposed to view.<br> Their precepts and commands a very maze of guile,<br> Their sentiments impossible to reconcile.</p>  
 <p>The Vazīr now delayed another forty days;<br> Then slew himself,—set free his soul from earth's affrays. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_350">350</a></font></span><br> The people, hearing of his death, were sorely grieved;<br> Around his corpse collected; eyes, ears, scarce believed.<br> With many bitter moans to sorrow they gave vent;<br> Their breasts they beat, their hair they tore, their clothing rent.<br> To count their multitudes is in God's power alone;<br> Turks, Arabs, Kurds, and Romans, <a name="fr_113"></a><a href="#fn_112"><font size="1">2</font></a> men of every zone.<br> They scattered o’er their heads the dust from his last home;<br> To mourn for him was balm, all ills to overcome.<br> They wept. Their bitter, briny tears they shed in floods;<br> His grave a pool; those tears, as streamlets from the woods. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_355">355</a></font></span><br> To lose him was a grief unspeakable that fell<br> On rich and poor, on high and low, too sad to tell.</p>  
 <p>A month of mourning past, the people sought to know<br> Whom he'd appointed in his place their way to show.<br> Whom must we recognise successor to our saint?<br> Into whose hands commit the task of our restraint?</p>

 <p>He was a sun of light; his fire hath turned to fume,<br> A candle now we need our darkness to illume.<br> Our friend is gone,—is lost to our inquiring eyes.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_360">360</a></font></span> A substitute we seek,—memorial we may prize.<br> Our rose is withered;—rosebush leaves all blown away,<br> Which vase holds now the rose-scent in its perfumed clay?"</p>  
 <p>God is invisible to weakly mortal sight,<br> His prophets are a need, to guide His Church aright.<br> No! That's not right! That phrase is sadly incorrect.<br> A prophet's one with God; not two. Think well! Reflect!<br> They are not two; they're one. Thou blind materialist!<br> With God they're one; their forms but make Him manifest.<br> Thou seest the form alone; thy two eyes are at fault.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_365">365</a></font></span> Look with thy soul; thou’lt see as God from heaven's vault.<br> Thy two sights will united be straightway in one,<br> When thou behold’st the Light of God's eternal throne.</p>  
 <p>Set up ten burning candles in one selfsame place,<br> A separate body, each, diffuses light and grace.<br> Their powers combine in one, to brighten that retreat;<br> Distinction now there's none; one light alone we meet.<br> Count out a hundred apples, quinces, pears, or plums;<br> When mashed together, all their juice, their pulp, their scums.<br> Things spiritual division, number, parts, know not,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_370">370</a></font></span> They split not into fractions, form no separate lot.</p>  
 <p>’Tis sweet when friends with friends together come and meet.<br> Trust then the spirit. "’Tis the letter kills"—repeat.<br> Thy body mortify; thy flesh consume with pains.<br> Behind it hid thou’lt find God's unity—thy gains.<br> If thou the body vex not,—bring not low betimes,<br> The flesh will thee destroy, my friend, in fiery flames.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_m51"><font size="1" color="green">p. 51</font></a></p>  
 <p>The flesh it is that shows itself to human heart;<br> The flesh it is demands asceticism's sharp smart.</p>  
 <p>We simple were; one essence was the source of all.<br> Nor Head, nor foot had we; one pristine lot did fall. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_375">375</a></font></span><br> One substance held us; we were clear as is the sun;<br> No knots or gnurs within us, free as water's run.<br> On taking fleshly form, that simple essence, then,<br> Became divided, split, like shadows in each glen.<br> Make low the hills and hillocks, level make the plain;<br> No shadow's left; the whole becomes one scene again.</p>  
 <p>With pleasure I'd this matter clearer put, and joy.<br> But tender consciences I seek not to annoy.<br> Abstruser points there are, as keen as sword in fight.<br> If reason's shield thou hast not, refuge take in flight. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_380">380</a></font></span><br> My arguments contest not, unless well prepared.<br> Sharp blade will cut; it pities not; no life is spared.<br> I sheathe my sword of argument,—will not make assault.<br> Lest muddlers read me wrong, and say ’tis I'm at fault.</p>  
 <p>We come now back again, to follow up our tale,<br> To keep our faith with readers, feminine and male;<br> And say again, the people rose up as one man,<br> Demanding who should work out our dead Vazīr's plan.</p>  
 <p>One legion-captain forward came, out of the twelve,<br> That grieving people's furrowed field anew to delve. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_385">385</a></font></span><br> Said he: "Behold! successor am I to the saint.<br> In Jesu's stead I'm regent, by his own constraint.<br> You see this scroll. ’Tis evidence of what I say:<br> The dead Vazīr's successorship is mine to-day!" <a name="fr_114"></a><a href="#fn_113"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> A second captain started up, as from ambush;<br> Contested all those words; his own claim then did push.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_m52"><font size="1" color="green">p. 52</font></a></p>  
 <p>Forth from his bosom he another scroll produced,<br> And then the people's wrath flamed high; not soon reduced.<br> The other captains, too,—each his own train at back,—<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_390">390</a></font></span> Unsheathed their swords, and threatened both their skulls to crack.<br> Then each one of the twelve, his sword and scroll in hand,<br> Upon the others set, like baited bull on brand.<br> The slain were strewn in heaps of many hundred men,<br> Their heads were piled in pyramids, by thousands ten.<br> Their blood was shed in torrents, flowing on the plain.<br> The dust arose in clouds through this commotion vain.<br> The seeds of discord sown by that knave's treacherous hand,<br> Had now produced their harvest, fatal to the land.<br> The nuts he cracked were skulls; their kernels, human brains.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_395">395</a></font></span> The bodies slain through him held precious souls in chains.</p>  
 <p>Be killed, or die, as in thy lot may be decreed.<br> So with pomegranates, apples, when sliced up at need.<br> The sweet and sound are prized, and straightway put to use;<br> The sour and rotten cast away, worthless refuse.<br> A word with sense and meaning's ever eloquent;<br> Bald nonsense is laughed down in scorn or merriment.<br> Thou fool, materialist! Think closer: look to sense. <a name="fr_115"></a><a href="#fn_114"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> The spirit ’tis gives value; words are mere pretence.<br> Prefer the company of those who spirit seek.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_400">400</a></font></span> So mayst thou grace attain,—"God's servant be," <a name="fr_116"></a><a href="#fn_115"><font size="1">2</font></a> and meek.<br> A life without a soul or spirit in our frame,<br> Like wooden sword in sheath, were but a senseless name.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_105"></a><a href="mes18.htm#fr_106">m40:3</a> Such is an eastern myth. Poets call the planet Venus the "<i>Harpist of the Spheres</i>."</p>

 <p><a name="fn_112"></a><a href="mes18.htm#fr_113">m49:2</a> The Roman conquest of Greece, Asia Minor, and Syria completely effaced from the Eastern mind all recollection of previous actors on those scenes.

 <p><a name="fn_118"></a><a href="mes18.htm#fr_119">m54:1</a> In Qur’ān lxi. 6, is the assertion that Jesus, in the Gospel, foretold the advent of Muhammed by the name of Ahmed. This is generally explained as a translation of περικλιτός, misread for παράκλητος in John xiv. 26. The two words have very much the same meaning: <i>much-praised, most laudable, laudatissimus</i>. Muhammed is mentioned by many names, forty, fifty, sixty; some say a thousand.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_119"></a><a href="mes18.htm#fr_120">m54:2</a> Muhammed gained the name of Trusty, El-Emīn (Al-Amīn), long before he declared himself commissioned to call his countrymen to acknowledge the unity of God, the resurrection, judgment, and future life.</p>
