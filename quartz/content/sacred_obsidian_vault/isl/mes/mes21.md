 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Great</span> Princes all! We've killed our dread external foe.<br> Within us, still, a worse than he remains, I trow.<br> To slay this inner foe is not the task of mind;<br> Our moral lion's not destroyed by tricks refined.</p>  
 <p>Our flesh, a hell; that hell a fiery dragon is.<br> Whole oceans can't extinguish those fierce flames of his.<br> Earth's seven oceans all were lost within his maw;<br> His raging fires would still burn high, to mankind's awe.<br> Pitcoal, hard-hearted miscreants; these are its food; <a name="fr_178"></a><a href="#fn_177"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> They sink within it, miserable, abject brood. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_5">5</a></font></span><br> Withal, its craving hunger ne’er will be appeased,<br> Until the voice of God cry unto it: "Art eased?"<br> "Eased?" will it answer; "No; not yet awhile by far;<br> Behold my flame, my fury,—burning, fiery roar."<br> It swallows down a universe in its fell mood;<br> And instantly shrieks out: "More food! More food! More food!"<br> God, from nubiquity, <a name="fr_179"></a><a href="#fn_178"><font size="1">2</font></a> His foot will stamp on hell.<br> Then will it cease to burn: "He willed, and it befell!" <a name="fr_180"></a><a href="#fn_179"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>  
 <p>Our fleshly lusts in us are but a part of hell;<br> Parts have the qualities of their universal. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_10">10</a></font></span></p>

 <p>The foot of God alone can stamp out hell's alarms.<br> Who else but God supreme to bend such bow has arms?<br> Straight arrows serve alone to be shot from a bow;<br> But lust's distorted spring shoots crooked arrows too.<br> Be thou in mind upright as arrow straight for bow.<br> A bow will not shoot straight, unless the arrow's so.</p>  
 <p>We've fought our fight and conquered in our outward strife.<br> Now turn we our attention to the inner life.<br> We've done with outer warfare, lesser as it is;<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_15">15</a></font></span> And as the Prophet, wage the greater warfare, his.<br> We put our trust in God; from Him we ask for aid;<br> With His assistance faith can move a mountain staid.<br> To rout an armed foe is nothing very fresh;<br> A lion true is he who conquers his own flesh.<br> To illustrate this truth, give ear unto a tale,<br> That thou of these few words the moral mayest inhale.</p>  
 <p>From Cæsar <a name="fr_181"></a><a href="#fn_180"><font size="1">1</font></a> an ambassador to ‘Umer came, <a name="fr_182"></a><a href="#fn_181"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> Through deserts far-extending, from Madīna's fame. <a name="fr_183"></a><a href="#fn_182"><font size="1">3</font></a><br> He asked?"

 <p>Whoever shall his heart cleanse from all passions’ bale,<br> Will soon perceive therein a court and presence hale. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_25">25</a></font></span><br> When Ahmed's heart was cleansed of evil's fire and smoke, <a name="fr_186"></a><a href="#fn_185"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> Whichever way he turned, God's countenance bespoke. <a name="fr_187"></a><a href="#fn_186"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> So long as man keeps company with evil thought,<br> How can he understand God's countenance in aught?<br> He that a window's pierced from heart towards heaven's recess,<br> Sees in each mote a ray from Sun of Righteousness. <a name="fr_188"></a><a href="#fn_187"><font size="1">3</font></a><br> God shines apparent in the midst of other things,<br> As moon in majesty among the stars’ twinklings.</p>  
 <p>Place thou two finger-tips upon thy two eyeballs.<br> What seest thou now of all the world? Darkness befalls. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_30">30</a></font></span><br> Thou seest it not; but that the world exists, thou’lt trust.<br> Our vices are the finger-tips of fleshly lust.<br> Thy finger-tips remove; <i>instanter</i>, as before,<br> Thou lookest around and seest whate’er thou wilt explore.<br> His people asked of Noah where righteousness might be.<br> He said: "Lo, there! With muffled heads you cannot see.<br> You've wrapped your cloaks in folds about your heads and eyes.<br> Your sense of sight cannot see what before you lies."</p>  
 <p>The world's eye man is; all the rest's mere skin and shell.<br> A real eye's he who strives his "Friend" to see right well. <a name="fr_189"></a><a href="#fn_188"><font size="1">4</font></a> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_35">35</a></font></span><br> Unless we see our Friend, ’twere better we were blind,<br> A friend that is not constant's better out of mind.</p>  
 <p>When Rome's ambassador had heard those words so wise, <a name="fr_190"></a><a href="#fn_189"><font size="1">5</font></a><br> His eager curiosity began to rise.</p>

 <p>He sought for ‘Umer with redoubled zeal and zest;<br> But in so doing lost his horse, and eke his chest.<br> He wandered everywhere to seek the Caliph out.<br> Like one distracted asked each passer-by his route.<br> "Is’t possible," he said, "that such a man there be,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_40">40</a></font></span> When like the soul to sight invisible is he?"</p>  
 <p>He sought for him as though he ’d been his truant slave,<br> But: "He who seeks shall find" ’s a very well-known stave.<br> A desert-Arab woman saw he at the last,<br> Who told him ‘Umer, then, beneath date-palm slept fast.<br> Beneath a date-palm! Far from mankind's busy plod.<br> That date-palm's shadow shaded the Shadow of God! <a name="fr_191"></a><a href="#fn_190"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>He went towards the tree; a station took afar;<br> He saw ‘Umer; a fit of trembling showed his fear.<br> On that ambassador did awe and dread alight.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_45">45</a></font></span> While o’er his heart there stole a sense of sweet delight.<br> Two feelings, love and dread, by nature opposites,<br> Were mingled in his bosom by some occult rites.<br> He thought within himself: "I've many princes seen;<br> In sovereign presence I have ever welcome been.<br> This fit of awe and trembling's very strange to me;<br> And yet without dismay this man I cannot see.<br> I've been in forests where the lions make their lair;<br> I've met them face to face; yet knew not what was fear.<br> In battle I've been, oft; in thickest of the fight.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_50">50</a></font></span> My arm's upheld our cause, when in most desperate plight.<br> Wounds have I dealt, received, that threatened life to take,<br> Among the brave, the bravest; my heart knew no quake.<br> This man is weaponless, supine upon the ground.<br> Why then this tremor? It my every limb has bound.<br> A ghostly awe is this; it's not a mortal fear.<br> Most certainly it's not a dread of this man here.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_m105"><font size="1" color="green">p. 105</font></a></p>  
 <p>He who fears God has admonition of the Lord;<br> Both men and demons stand in awe of his mere word."<br> Mute he remained in reverential attitude,<br> Till ‘Umer woke from his trance of beatitude. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_55">55</a></font></span></p>  
 <p>Profound obeisance and grave salutation made,<br> As said the Prophet: "First, salute; then, embassade."<br> The Caliph answered: "And on thee be peace! Draw near;"<br> Assured him of protection; bade him put off fear.<br> "Fear not" a word of comfort is to trembling soul;<br> A generous tribute ’tis, when strong with weak condole.<br> Men set at ease the object whom they wish to raise,—<br> Relieve his heart from palpitation; bid fears cease.<br> But unto one who feals no dread how say: "Fear not "?<br> What lesson's this thou givest to one whose lesson's got? <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_60">60</a></font></span></p>  
 <p>So ‘Umer put at ease that much perturbed man;<br> And calmed his wavering mind, as noble hearts best can.<br> To him he then addressed some subtle words of sense,<br> Set forth the attributes of God,—man's best defence,<br> Declared the goodness of the Lord to all who trust<br> In Him alone; the rank they gain in trance combust.</p>  
 <p>Saint's ecstasy springs from a glimpse of God, his pride.<br> His station's that of intimate. He's bridegroom; God is bride. <a name="fr_192"></a><a href="#fn_191"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> A bride's veiled graces are not seen by groom alone;<br> Her unveiled charms solely to him in private shown. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_65">65</a></font></span><br> In state she first appears before the people all;<br> Her veil removed, the groom alone is at her call.<br> Entranced are many Gnostic worshippers, I ween;<br> Few gain admission to the presence-chamber scene.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_m106"><font size="1" color="green">p. 106</font></a></p>  
 <p>‘Umer told all the stations passed through by his soul;—<br> Its flights, fights, tribulations, ere it was made whole.<br> He spoke of times when flight of time's of no account;<br> Of Holiness's station, glorious to recount.<br> He talked of atmospheres in which his righteous soul<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_70">70</a></font></span> Had soared to seek fresh conquests of devotion's whole.<br> Its every flight had been beyond th’ horizon scant;<br> Beyond the hope, or e’en desire, of aspirant.</p>  
 <p>He found a willing list’ner in the stranger guest,<br> Whose mind was framed t’ investigate such mysteries blest.<br> The teacher was perfection; novice full of zeal;<br> Like clever jockey on a steed with lightning heel.<br> He found his scholar apt, of great capacity.<br> So good seed sowed in fertile soil sagacity.</p>  
 <p>Th’ ambassador now asked: "Of true believers Prince!<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_75">75</a></font></span> How can a soul from heaven come down to earth's province;—<br> How can so great a bird be cooped up in a cage?"</p>  
 <p>He answered: "God speaks words of power, most sage.<br> Those words, addressed to nothings without eyes or ears,<br> Set them in motion. Like a ferment, fruit it bears.<br> Those words no sooner spoken, quick those nothings all<br> In motion put themselves, and reach existence’ hall.<br> Or He commands these beings, creatures of His own;<br> And they return to nothing, whence He them had drawn.<br> He speaks unto the flowers; they forthwith burst in bloom.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_80">80</a></font></span> His voice the flint hears; lo, it's a cornelian stone.<br> A spell He laid on matter; spirit it became.<br> By charm from Him the sun sprang forth, a lambent flame.<br> If He but whisper words of awe, the sun again<br> Is seized with darkness of eclipse, like night amain.<br> What is’t He says, by which the teeming eye of cloud<br> Sheds forth its tears, as drops from water-skin unsewed?</p>  
 <p><a name="page_m107"><font size="1" color="green">p. 107</font></a></p>  
 <p>What incantation to the earth addresses He,<br> To make it produce cattle,—whose hides used may be?<br> The hesitations of each puzzled child of thought<br> Arise from some enigma by which God's him caught. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_85">85</a></font></span><br> On horns of a dilemma is he fixed, poor man.<br> 'Shall I do this,' says he, 'when ’ts opposite I can?'<br> From God, too, is the power to make selection's choice<br> Of two solutions. One is taken, through inward voice.<br> Wouldst thou be always free from hesitation, fool?<br> Stuff not thy mind's ear tight with doubt's dull cotton-wool;<br> That thou mayst solve the riddles God may set for thee;—<br> That thou mayst understand the full of mercy free.<br> Then shall thy heart receive His inspiration's gift,—<br> A power of speaking from an inward impulse’ drift. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_90">90</a></font></span><br> The ear and eye of soul are organs not of sense;<br> The ears of sense and mind are not like soul's, intense.<br> The word "<i>compulsion</i>" puts me out of humour quite.<br> Who hath not love of God, compulsion's slave's, by right.<br> This union's based on truth (compulsion is too proud);<br> It is a glimpse of sunshine breaking through a cloud.<br> Be it compulsion. Man's compulsion it is not;—<br> Not the compulsion of browbeating from a sot.<br> Compulsion's felt by them, my very worthy friend,<br> Whose eyes of faith, ope’d in their hearts, on God attend. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_95">95</a></font></span><br> The absent and the future patent are to them;<br> To speak about the past is what they most contemn.<br> Election and compulsion, theirs, are not the same.<br> As dewdrops in the oyster-shell rare pearls became. <a name="fr_193"></a><a href="#fn_192"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> Outside, they're dewdrops, solely, whether great or small;<br> Inside they're pearls of price, whose value knows no fall.<br> Such men by nature are just like the musk-deer's pod;<br> It's fed with blood of artery, musk it yields, through God.</p>

 <p>Let's contemplate the acts of God, the deeds of men;<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_110">110</a></font></span> Know, men's deeds do exist. This truth is patent, then.<br> If men's deeds be not in this nether world of ours,<br> Say not thou unto others: "Why these deeds of yours?"<br> God's act it is through which those deeds of ours arise;<br> Our acts are but the sequels of God's agencies.</p>  
 <p>The letter, or the spirit, ’tis, our reason weighs.<br> But both at once it cannot comprehend always.</p>

 <p>The reason Satan gave: "Since Thou hast tempted me," <a name="fr_198"></a><a href="#fn_197"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> The scheming demon strove to hide his sin, we see.<br> His trespass Adam owned: "Against ourselves we've sinned." <a name="fr_199"></a><a href="#fn_198"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> God's act he, like as we, then left not out of mind.<br> Through shame the act of Satan Adam secret kept.<br> Self-accusation's fruit, in consequence, he reaped. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_120">120</a></font></span><br> Repentance shown by Adam, God in mercy said:<br> "In thee ’twas I created, sin thou hast displayed.<br> Was it not My decree and providence that thou,<br> In asking pardon, shouldst the tempter disavow?"<br> Said Adam: "Thee I feared; most bitter shame I felt."<br> God added: "It was I who gave thee shame heartfelt."</p>  
 <p>Consideration he who shows considered is;<br> So he who brings the sugar, share of cake is his.<br> For whom, then, benefits, but practisers of good? <a name="fr_200"></a><a href="#fn_199"><font size="1">3</font></a><br> Keep pleased thy friend.

 <p>A question ’tis of judgment; judgment shrewdness is,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_130">130</a></font></span> Until some weakness intervene to mar all this.<br> A question, now, of judgment as to corals, pearls,<br> Is not the same as one about the soul, you churls.<br> A question of the soul's another matter quite;<br> The wine that feeds the soul comes not from grapes, black, white.</p>

 <p>Cæsar's ambassador no sooner ‘Umer heard,<br> Than light broke on his heart; at which he stroked his beard.<br> All questions and all answers from his mind went quite;<br> All sense of right and wrong had vanished front his sight. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_145">145</a></font></span><br> He'd found the source; what need, then, of the streams?<br> To gather further wisdom, pondering on the means,<br> He said: "‘Umer, pray tell me what's the end and use<br> Of shutting up that thing of light in darkness’ house?<br> How can clear water be expected from black mud?<br> Why then is the pure soul combined with flesh and blood?"<br> He answered: "Most important question hast thou raised.<br> A sense, a spirit, by the letter paraphrased.<br> The free, the jocund spirit prisoner thou’st made;<br> As though the mind, the air, could into letter fade. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_150">150</a></font></span><br> Thou hast done this for explanation's sake,— <a name="fr_202"></a><a href="#fn_201"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> Thou, who beyond the explanation place wouldst take.<br> How should the man in whom the explanation's gleamed,<br> Not yet distinguish what's to me so clearly beamed?<br> Ten thousand explanations are there, each of which<br> Is most momentous,—than ten thousand others, rich.<br> With that, thy speech, now compoundly particular,<br> A universal explanation were,—no bar.<br> Thou art a partial,—seekest explanation still;<br> Why set thyself, then, to deny th’ universal? <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_155">155</a></font></span><br> Unless thy speech contain some use, propound it not;<br> And if it have, objection quit; give what thou’st got.</p>
