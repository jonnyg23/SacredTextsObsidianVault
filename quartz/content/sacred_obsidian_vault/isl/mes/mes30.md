 <p>THE Prophet asked one morn of Zeyd, in tender tone, <a name="fr_376"></a><a href="#fn_375"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> "How art thou, dear disciple, faithful to the bone?"<br> "I'm pious;—a believer," Zeyd replied; and he<br> Inquired again: "What proof of faith resides in thee?"<br> He said: "Whole days I've burnt with parching fever's thirst;<br> By night I've watched; with love's sweet pangs my heart's nigh burst.<br> Thus have I traversed days’ and nights’ enduring space,<br> As point of spear through shield makes way in war's embrace.<br> For, in love's view, the church of faith one body is;<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_5">5</a></font></span> Ten million years, one instant, are alike, when His.<br> The past eternity and future join in one;<br> Though reason cannot compass how the marvel's done."</p>  
 <p>The Prophet then: "Bring forth some souvenir from thence,<br> Shall satisfy all men of judgment and of sense."<br> Said Zeyd: "As men behold the sky above their heads,<br> So I survey the heavens, and all their flowery meads.<br> Eight paradises, <a name="fr_377"></a><a href="#fn_376"><font size="1">2</font></a> seven deep hells, <a name="fr_378"></a><a href="#fn_377"><font size="1">3</font></a> are in my view,<br> As patent as the idol to its silly crew.</p>

 <p>Apart, and one by one, I can discern all men,<br> As wheat and barley well are known to miller's ken. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_10">10</a></font></span><br> I see who's heavenward bound, who takes the other road;<br> As men distinguish fish from snake in walks abroad."</p>  
 <p>’Tis thus that saints, within the bounds of present life,<br> See who'll be blessed, who cursed, when tried in judgment's strife;<br> Before each soul contracts the sins will cause its shame;<br> While yet in mother's womb,—while yet without a name.<br> The wretch is he conceived for wretchedness’ sad thirst.<br> Each soul is marked for future bliss or woe, at first. <a name="fr_379"></a><a href="#fn_378"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> The body, as a mother, bears within a soul.<br> Death's but the throes that launch the spirit to its goal. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_15">15</a></font></span><br> Departed souls are all agog at each fresh birth,<br> To see what class the new-born enters in its mirth.<br> The blacks presume ’twill prove to be of their dark gang;<br> The pale-faced Romans hope they'll profit by the pang.<br> But when the little stranger shows itself at last,<br> No room remains for doubt; the question's judged and cast.<br> The new-born black is borne in triumph by its kind;<br> The rosy-cheeked fair bantling's claimed by Roman mind.<br> Until its birth the child's a riddle to all men.<br> Who knows an unborn infant ’s rare sage in this glen. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20">20</a></font></span><br> Unless, mayhap, he see with light divine's blest aid;<br> For this can penetrate through densest shell e’er made.<br> The life-conveying fluid's colourless and clear;<br> But living men their various shades of colour bear.<br> The soul sustains complexions in our mortal frames,<br> Until our halves material find rest from their games.<br> But turn we now away to other subjects, high;<br> For fear events should leave us to regret and sigh.</p>

 <p>Thus spake the Prophet's servant, in delirious guise.<br> The Prophet shook his collar,—sign of deep surprise.<br> Then spake: "Rein in thy steed!

 <p>Replied the Prophet: "On thy eye thy finger place;<br> The world is straight deprived of all the sun's bright face!<br> A finger-tip suffices to blot out the moon;<br> A symbol, this, of God's great sin-effacing boon.<br> A point can cover up a whole world with its shade;<br> The sun can be eclipsed by what's a mere monade.<br> Shut close thy lips.

 <p>The heart commands, the hands to calculations fall;<br> Should it prefer, they write a book or treatise small.<br> A hand there is, ’twould seem, within these hands of ours;<br> A hidden hand, that moves the body's wondrous powers.<br> If that incites, this wages battle with the foe;<br> Should that induce, this aids a friend to stand tiptoe.<br> It pushes; straightway spoon's plunged into soup;<br> It wills; a ponderous club forthwith attacks some group.<br> What is it that the heart says to them all by turns?<br> Most wonderful accord!

 <p>Luqmān the sage, in presence of his noble lord, <a name="fr_391"></a><a href="#fn_390"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> Among the slaves and servants was a mere byword. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_85">85</a></font></span></p>

 <p>The lord one day commanded; straight some slaves were sent<br> To gather fruit from orchard for his throat's content.<br> With them did Luqmān go, as parasite to feast,<br> Brimful of wisdom, black as night, a negro beast.<br> Their labour o’er, the slaves lay down to rest awhile;<br> The fruit they tasted, tasted still, consumed the pile.<br> Returning home, on Luqmān the whole blame they laid;<br> His lord was angered mightily at what they said.<br> Luqmān inquired the cause of this estrangement keen.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_90">90</a></font></span> The lord gave vent in loud abuse to his roused spleen.<br> Said Luqmān: "Lord, I swear by God's most holy name,<br> Dishonest servant ne’er can hope for aught but blame.<br> Make proof of us. ’Tis easy. Lord thou art of all.<br> Command. We'll drink our fill of water hot as gall.<br> Then make us run about within the meadow's bound.<br> On horseback thou, on foot we, ’ll all trudge quickly round.<br> Thou soon shalt witness sights to show 'the milk who spilt.'<br> Hearts’ secrets’ Great Revealer will disclose the guilt."</p>  
 <p>Their lord so ordered. Scalding water soon was sought.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_95">95</a></font></span> Each had to drink his fill, as hot as could be brought.<br> Then all were made to run as fast as they could tear,<br> All up and down the meadow, as their legs could bear.<br> Now lo! What happens? Sickness on them, each, soon falls;<br> To vomit they're constrained, with starting of eyeballs.<br> The stolen fruit contained within their stomach's sack,<br> The water's stimulus compelled them to give back.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_m261"><font size="1" color="green">p. 261</font></a></p>  
 <p>When Luqmān's turn was come to cast up his accounts,<br> Clear water was the only issue from his founts.<br> Luqmān's philosophy this trial could evolve;<br> God's wisdom far abstruser riddles will resolve. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_100">100</a></font></span><br> "The day when our hearts’ secrets shall be all revealed,"<br> Man's secret foe in ambush shall not lie concealed.<br> Hell's victims, then, shall taste of scalding water's pang;<br> And all veils be torn off from sins they overhang.<br> Hell-fire's decreed to be the lot of misbelief;<br> Since fire the ordeal is by which stones come to grief.</p>  
 <p>How often have we spoken to those hearts of stone,<br> In softest accents of advice! They would hear none!<br> To foulest ulcer, sharpest remedy's applied.<br> The teeth of dogs alone are fit for ass's hide. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_105">105</a></font></span><br> "Filth to the filthy" is philosophy right sound.<br> "Birds of a feather flock together" goes its round.<br> What mates soever for thyself thou choose at last,<br> Their habits and their qualities acquire thou fast.<br> Wouldst glory have? To glory must thou raise pretence.<br> Wouldst it reject? Think well; and take thy road from thence.<br> Wouldst find a way out of this dismal dungeon vile?<br> Submit to God; bow down in worship with a smile.<br> Again we'll turn. Again we'll hear what Zeyd may say;<br> What road he'll follow, on his steed, in reason's way. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_110">110</a></font></span><br> When reason sets itself t’ expose the faults of men,<br> It pulls aside the veils that hide them from our ken.<br> God sometimes wills that actions should concealed remain,<br> Drives reason's drum away, forbids its noisy strain.</p>  
 <p>Loose not thy tongue alone; it bridle; hidden's best.<br> Let each be happy in his own opinion's zest.<br> God wills that they who might despair to win His grace,<br> Shall persevere, not slacken, in their worship's pace</p>  
 <p><a name="page_m262"><font size="1" color="green">p. 262</font></a></p>  
 <p>That they may seek a hopeful one, and him ensue;—<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_115">115</a></font></span> In his society may follow worship's clue.<br> God wishes that His peace should light upon us all;<br> That His salvation should embrace good, bad, great, small.<br> That princes and that captives all should turn their face,<br> In hope and fear, up heavenward, looking for His grace.</p>  
 <p>That hope and fear are nourished by a curtain's shade.<br> ’Tis through uncertainty that hope and fear invade.<br> But tear away that veil; where then are hope and fear?<br> ’Tis veiledness lends interest to landscapes drear.<br> Upon a river's bank a youth, who chanced to spy<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_120">120</a></font></span> A fisherman at work, guessed: "Solomon, surely! <a name="fr_392"></a><a href="#fn_391"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> If he it be, why here, in secret and alone?<br> If not, whence come those features, fit to grace a throne?"<br> So he remained in doubt, ’twixt two opinions tossed,<br> Till Solomon recovered all the power he'd lost.</p>  
 <p>The foul usurping demon fled the royal state;<br> The king's avenging sword pursued and sealed his fate.<br> The signet-ring of power once more on royal hand,<br> The demons and the fairies flocked to his command.<br> Mankind came crowding to his court, by levee swelled;<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_125">125</a></font></span> Among them came the youth who'd that opinion held.<br> He saw the signet-ring. This sufficed. Doubt was past.<br> No room was left for surmise. All was clear at last.</p>  
 <p>Opinion may be formed of what's behind a veil.<br> Conjecture lends its aid where knowledge ‘gins to fail.<br> Conjecture's potent when the subject's hid from view.<br> Let it be visible; no surmise can we brew.<br> Although the sky of light is not without its rain,<br> The earth of darkness, too, produces plants and grain.</p>

 <p>The warden of a castle on the marches laid,<br> Far from his sovereign, distant from much-needed aid,<br> Defends his post with valour from beleaguering foe,<br> Disdains to be bought over, scorns the tempter's moe.<br> His station's on a frontier, no eye sees him act;<br> To duty true, he honestly fulfils his pact.<br> Then in his monarch's presence honours due he gains,<br> Above the brave men fighting in the royal trains. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_140">140</a></font></span><br> More merit's in a little secret service given,<br> Than in much more performed when by an eye it's driven.</p>  
 <p>Man's faith and piety on earth are prized of God.<br> But after death professed, less value have than clod.<br> The absent and the hidden being thus the best,<br> The silent mouth and sealed lip surpass the rest.<br> Then boast not, brother; whatsoever thou hast done,<br> God knows thy merits; will requite them every one.</p>

 <p>What's all thy effort worth? Thou hast to die at last;<br> Put out thy hand and grasp the cup of life right fast.</p>

 <p>A conflagration raged in days of great ’Umer,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_210">210</a></font></span> Stones were devoured therein, as firewood in the air. <a name="fr_407"></a><a href="#fn_406"><font size="1">3</font></a><br> The buildings it consumed, and left whole households waste;<br> The nests and nestlings were destroyed;—last trump's foretaste.<br> One half Medīna fell a prey to ruthless flame,<br> Whereat th’ aqueous element might well feel shame.<br> Whole cisterns were exhausted in the combat wild;<br> And vinegar was added.

 <p>‘Umer replied: "In form and custom, bread you've given.<br> But not from love of God.
