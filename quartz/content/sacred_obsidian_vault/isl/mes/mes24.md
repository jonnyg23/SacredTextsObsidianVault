 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">An</span> Arab woman once thus to her husband spake,<br> Insisting strongly he'd of these words notice take:<br> "How very poor we are! What hardships have we borne!<br> The whole world lives in pleasures; we're the butt of scorn!<br> We have no bread; for condiment we've grief and cares.<br> Jug, pitcher we possess not; drink we naught but tears.<br> By day, our only raiment's scorching solar heat;<br> Our bedclothes in the night, the moon's rays pale and sweet.<br> The disk of Luna we may well imagine bread.<br> Our hands we lift to heaven; keen hunger's pangs we dread. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_5">5</a></font></span><br> E’en mendicants feel shame at our dire poverty.<br> Our days are dark as night, through drear adversity.<br> Our kindred, as all strangers, sight of us now shun.<br> Just like the wandering Jew, for fear we should them dun. <a name="fr_283"></a><a href="#fn_282"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> When I would borrow half a handful of lentils,<br> The neighbours wish me dead; their wrath on me distils.<br> Amongst us Arabs pride is felt in war and gifts,<br> Among those very Arabs thou’rt devoid of shifts.<br> What need of war have we?

 <p>What need of faults, O sinless one? We're in hell-fire!<br> What solace have we? Overwhelmed with deep desire!<br> What gifts have we to give? We silent beggars sit!<br> Could we but seize a gnat, its throat we'd straightway slit!<br> If guest should come to us, as sure as I'm alive,<br> When he was sunk in sleep, to strip him we would strive."<br> Such grumblings, and as follows, going on all day,<br> She made her husband wish her fifty miles away<br> "Unbroken destitution's brought us both to straits.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_15">15</a></font></span> My heart burns for our sorrows; hope's gleam ne’er awaits.<br> How long are we to suffer torture such as this?<br> With hunger's agony, like coals of fire we hiss.<br> Should any stranger guest come unexpectedly,<br> What shame we'd feel him to receive dejectedly.<br> If any visitor should pass our way this eve,<br> Unless we eat his sandals, what food can we give?"</p>  
 <p>"Hence ’tis the wise have said in proverb, rendered free<br> 'A guest should never go where he'll not welcome be.'<br> Who'd wish to be the guest confiding of a man,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20">20</a></font></span> Who'll strip thee to the skin, bare, gladly, if he can?<br> Unhappy in himself, can he thee happy make?<br> He can impart no light; deep gloom's his only stake.<br> Not feeling gladsome in himself, with others met,<br> He cannot yield to them what he has not as yet.<br> Suppose a man ophthalmic start as oculist;<br> Of granite-dust alone will his eye-salves consist.<br> So ’tis with all in times of misery and need;<br> Let no one, then, come blindly to our house to feed."</p>  
 <p>Hast never seen reality of famine near?<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_25">25</a></font></span> Look well at us; thou’lt see effects of food too dear.<br> Our outward look is black, like dark pretender's heart.<br> This lacks enlightenment, though his exterior's smart.</p>

 <p>He has no hope of God, nor any good to show,<br> Though more than Seth or Adam he pretend to know.<br> Ev'n Satan unto him no trace of self has shown,<br> And yet he claims to be a Vicar of God's own. <a name="fr_284"></a><a href="#fn_283"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> Some Gnostic terms he uses as a plagiarist,<br> That he may lead the people as though secretist.<br> A critic, ’sooth, is he; complains of Bāyezīd; <a name="fr_285"></a><a href="#fn_284"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> Whereas Yezīd himself would blush at his bald creed. <a name="fr_286"></a><a href="#fn_285"><font size="1">3</font></a> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_30">30</a></font></span><br> Of heavenly bread and table, nothing has he known;<br> The barest bone to him, vile dog, God has not thrown.<br> He pompously proclaims: "My table have I spread;<br> Vicegerent's son, God's Vicar, here am I indeed!<br> Then welcome, all ye simpletons! Come in; Come in!<br> From table of my bounty fill yourselves within."<br> For years he dupes them with "To-morrow's" promise still.<br> The arrant arch-deceiver, whose "To-morrow's" <i>nil</i>.</p>

 <p>Pretenders carry famine in their heart of hearts.<br> We suffer only want of bread for our repasts.<br> Why, then, pretender-like, should we our want disguise?<br> Why, for appearance' sake, our soul, too, bastardise?</p>  
 <p>The woman's husband answered: "Pray now, silence keep!<br> Our life is most part o’er. What's left us but to weep?"</p>  
 <p>"The wise man cares not for a little more or less.<br> These both will pass away, like torrent's waywardness.<br> A torrent may be clear, or muddy, black as ink.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_45">45</a></font></span> It will not last. Why then should we about it think?"</p>  
 <p>"Within this world what millions, living creatures all,<br> A life of joy still lead, quite free from let or fall.<br> A dove is always cooing praises to the Lord,<br> Upon a tree, so long as day may light afford.<br> A nightingale sings hymns, God's name to bless alway.<br> For unto Thee he trusts, Who hearest us when we pray.<br> A falcon, when he sits upon a royal fist,<br> No longer stoops to carrion, wherewith to subsist.<br> And so from gnat to elephant like state we find,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_50">50</a></font></span> They all depend on God, the best of feeders’ kind."</p>  
 <p>"All those anxieties that fall on us like darts,<br> Are but the vapours, tempests, of our human hearts.<br> Those cares are like a sickle, made to cut us down.<br> This is a fact, though we are slow the truth to own.<br> Our ev’ry suffering, here, a portion is of death.<br> This part of death, then, drive away whilst thou hast breath.<br> If from this part of death thou findst thou canst not run;<br> Thou’rt sure whole death will follow, as the light the sun.<br> If thou canst learn to think this part of death is sweet,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_55">55</a></font></span> Thou knowest that God will make its whole thy tastes to meet.</p>

 <p>Our troubles are the heralds of our death to come.<br> Turn not thy face away from herald, as do some."<br> "Whoever leads a joyous life finds death severe.<br> And he who's slave to body, mars his soul's career.<br> When sheep come home from pasture in the meadows green,<br> The fattest ones are slaughtered, soon as they are seen.<br> The night is spent, the morn is come, my bosom friend,<br> When wilt thou bring thy grumbling gossip to an end?<br> Once thou wert young, and more content a hundred-fold;<br> Then covetous becamest, though thyself art gold. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_60">60</a></font></span><br> A fruitful vine thou wert; a blight's come over thee;<br> Thy fruit will never ripe, ’twill shrivel on the tree.<br> Sweet fruit, with flavour, give, thy inward worth to prove.<br> Thou backwards shouldst not walk, as ropemakers all move.<br> Thou art my helpmate fond; and fellow-workers all,<br> Of one mind still should be, or their joint work must fall.<br> A pair should ever be conformable in aim.<br> A pair of shoes examine; pair of boots, the same.<br> If one boot of a pair be too small for the foot,<br> The pair is useless; vain, the other's size to moot. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_65">65</a></font></span><br> One boot is small; the other, ’haps, too large is found.<br> Hast ever known a lion consort with a hound?<br> Two packs upon a camel equipoise require;<br> The one must not be half, the other bale entire.<br> I choose the road that leads straight to contentment's door,<br> Why takest thou the path to sin and misery's floor?"<br> The woman's husband, suffering, but resigned still,<br> Thus spake unto his wife, to calm her restive will.</p>  
 <p>The woman raised a shout: "O man of simple mind!<br> I will no longer listen to thy words, though kind. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_70">70</a></font></span><br> Talk not to me of claims, pretensions, and such stuff.<br> I care not one pin's point for pride and flimsy fluff.</p>

 <p>Why preach so loud of sentiment and honour's call?<br> Just look at our condition.

 <p>Did crows but realise their ugliness supreme,<br> As white as snow they'd change, through rage and arrant shame.<br> A charmer sings a charm against a snake, his foe;<br> The snake charms him in turn; hence follows boundless woe.<br> Were not his trap a charm prepared by the snake,<br> Would he become the victim of some small mistake?<br> The charmer first is caught in toils of greed and lust.<br> And sees not ’tis the snake has charmed him, bound him fast. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_90">90</a></font></span><br> The snake addresses him: 'O charmer!

Art not soft-brained?<br> That name will one day vengeance on thee for me take.<br> In fear of that dread name, I, soul and body, quake.<br> He'll either take thy life with poison-fang of mine;<br> Or, like me, unto prison He will thee consign!'" <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_95">95</a></font></span><br> Thus spake the woman bitterly unto her spouse,<br> Whole volumes would not hold the words that she let loose.</p>

 <p>When God decrees an ill, man's judgment falls asleep.<br> And perspicacity knows not which way to leap.<br> The doom of ill struck home, man straight feels deep regret;<br> Propriety outraged, he turns to mourn and fret.</p>  
 <p>Addressing, then, his wife, he said: "My shame is great!<br> I've acted as a heathen, ah!

 <p>No one of them the camel's foal could overtake.<br> It fled among the hills,—was lost to sight. Heartache!<br> E’en so the soul, when once its prison bars are burst,<br> Unto the Lord of Grace its winged flight takes first.<br> The prophet then: "The threatened judgment now must storm;<br> All hope's gone by;—dead as that camel's lifeless form.<br> Still, if, by coaxing, you her foal can win back here,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_290">290</a></font></span> In calm tranquillity, from whence it's fled through fear,<br> With its return of confidence you may be saved;<br> But otherwise, despair and gnash your teeth, depraved!"</p>  
 <p>His threat they heard; dejected were at its import.<br> Their looks sank downcast;—sad anxiety's resort.<br> The first day came; they saw each visage jaundiced o’er;<br> And thence, in fell dismay, they laments uttered, sore.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_m185"><font size="1" color="green">p. 185</font></a></p>  
 <p>Their scarlet skins, the second day, told plainer still,<br> Time for repentance was but short, and hope was <i>nil</i>.<br> The blackened faces, on the third day, clearly told<br> The prophet's threat was strictly true.

 <p>Thus being brought to quit their menaces and scowls;<br> Upon their knees, hams, breasts, they crouched like roosting fowls.<br> This cringing posture has that abject, trembling crew,<br> In holy writ, inspired, dubbed "crouching;" <a name="fr_304"></a><a href="#fn_303"><font size="1">1</font></a> and ’tis true.<br> (Kneel, thou, at times when by instructors thou art taught,<br> And when thou’rt warned that "crouching" ’s with abjection fraught.)<br> In hopeless expectation God's blow to ensue,<br> The countryside entire within their homes withdrew.</p>

 <p>On hearing these sad sounds the prophet burst in tears;<br> Responsive to those moans, he groaned.—No listening ears!<br> The dead he then addressed: "O people, chid in vain!<br> How often ’gainst you to the Lord I've wept, with pain!<br> The Lord me answered: 'Patience have with their misdeeds;<br> To them give counsel still; not long will last those needs!' <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_305">305</a></font></span><br> Remark I made: 'With such misdeeds will counsel count?<br> As milk, kind counsel flows from love's unsullied fount!'<br> The untold wrongs you'd heaped upon my patient head<br> Had curdled milk of counsel in my bosom's stead.</p>

 <p>The Arab now his little pot of water showed.<br> As seed to earth, he it on Caliph's court bestowed; <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_575">575</a></font></span><br> And said: "Present my offering at the sovereign's feet,<br> If beggar save his king from want, it's surely meet.<br> The water's fresh; the little jar green-glazed and new;<br> Filled from a pool replenished by the rain and dew."</p>  
 <p><a name="page_m204"><font size="1" color="green">p. 204</font></a></p>

 <p>Our little learning is the Arab's water-pot.<br> In Caliph, of God's wisdom we've an emblem got.<br> We bring our pot of water to great Tigris’ stream.<br> If we ourselves not asses call, us asses deem.<br> The Arab of our tale excusable was,—troth;<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_610">610</a></font></span> He knew not of a Tigris. Where's the Arab doth?<br> Had he, as we, known Tigris’ stream, and all its store,<br> His water-pot had never travelled to its shore;<br> Had he become aware of what a Tigris meant,<br> Arrived at Bagdād, he'd his pot to fragments sent.</p>  
 <p>The Caliph, when he saw that pot, and heard that tale,<br> The vase had filled with golden sequins, like a bale,<br> Our Arab thus to free from poverty's rude grasp;—<br> A robe of honour, too; and presents for his clasp,<br> He ordered. Then the whole unto the guards were sent,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_615">615</a></font></span> With kindliest injunctions, fruit of good intent:<br> "That all unto that Arab man be safely given,<br> Whose journey home by Tigris’ arrowy stream be driven.<br> By land he came; he'd travelled all the way on foot;<br> But Tigris’ stream may bear him back a shorter route."</p>  
 <p>Our Arab in a boat was placed at river's side;<br> The stream he saw, admired, bowed low, lost all his pride;<br> Exclaiming: "Wondrous goodness of the sovereign will!<br> Th’ acceptance of my water-pot more wondrous still!<br> How could that sea of wealth my drop deign to accept,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_620">620</a></font></span> And largely thus to recompense the trifle kept?"</p>  
 <p>Know now, my friend, this world ’s one mighty water-pot,<br> With wisdom and with beauty teeming; as all wot.<br> One drop, however, ’tis, from ocean of His grace,<br> Whose fulness cannot be confined in any place.<br> That treasure latent was. Through fulness it burst forth,<br> More glorious than the heavens became thenceforth the earth.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_m207"><font size="1" color="green">p. 207</font></a></p>  
 <p>The latent treasure, pouring out its riches great,<br> The earth made kinglike, clothed with more than regal state.<br> One little branch canal from th’ ocean of God's grace,<br> Thus overwhelms this mighty water-pot of space. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_625">625</a></font></span></p>  
 <p>They who see God are ever rapt in ecstasy;<br> And raptured, hold that water-pot mere fallacy.<br> O thou! envy of whom is to that pot a stone!<br> Though fractured by the shock, the pot yields sounder tone.<br> The pot is cracked; but, still, its water is not spilt;<br> The crack's the very source through which it's sounder built.<br> The jar's each single particle's in dance and revery,<br> Though unto man's poor wisdom this seems foolery.<br> The pot, the world, all it contains, are lost to view.<br> Consider well this fact! God knows it's simply true. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_630">630</a></font></span></p>  
 <p>If thou canst grasp this meaning, thou’rt like falcon strong.<br> Beat, then, the pinions of thy thoughts. Be hawk, ere long.<br> Thought's pinions are bemired in thee, and heavy move;<br> Because thou feedest on clay; clay's bread to thee, I'll prove.<br> As flesh, bread is but clay. Trust not thereon for strength;<br> Or thou’lt remain, claylike, within the earth at length.</p>  
 <p>Dost hunger? What art thou, then, but a dog?<br> Fierce, ill-affected, raging; lusts thy vitals clog!<br> And when with food thou’rt filled, polluted straight becomest.<br> Thou losest strength and sense; mere stock, thou sleep welcomest. <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_635">635</a></font></span> <br> So, being doglike or a stock, senseless, impure,<br> How canst thou progress make in path of virtue, sure?</p>

 <p>Whatever ’tis thou huntest, dog thou art, in sooth.<br> Feed not, then, thus, the dog of lust's voracious tooth.<br> When dogs are satisfied, obedience they forswear;<br> To follow up the game they one and all forbear.</p>  
 <p>His want it was disposed the Arab of our tale,<br> To travel till he'd reached the Caliph's courtly vale.<br> We've shown the bounty of that sovereign merciful,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_640">640</a></font></span> Shed on the Arab's wretchedness, most plentiful.</p>  
 <p>Whate’er a lover says, the sentiment of love<br> Shines through his words, if but thoughts towards his mistress rove.<br> Discourses he on law, love furnishes the theme;<br> Throughout his labouring periods, love's the enthymeme.<br> Should blasphemy rise to his lips, of faith it smacks.<br> Doubt, when by him expressed, shows confidence's knacks.<br> The spume that rises from the sea of his pure heart<br> Partakes the nature of its source, truth's counterpart.<br> We must esteem such spume as foam of mountain-rill;—<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_645">645</a></font></span> Upbraiding from a lip beloved is worshipped still.<br> Attention we pay not to harsh words issuing thence,;—<br> The features we adore divest them of offence.<br> However strange such utterances, they all seem true;<br> The stranger they appear, to sense they lend more cue.</p>  
 <p>If sugar we should cast in mould to look like bread,<br> Then eat it, we the sugar taste. Form's of no stead.<br> Should true believer golden idol light upon,<br> Will he for worship set it up, anon, anon?<br> Nay! To the fire he'll quickly it in wrath cosign,<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_650">650</a></font></span> And strip it of the form that makes it sin's foul sign.<br> The gold, abstracted from the idol's form, is pure.<br> That form it is corrupts,—can men to sin allure.<br> The gold's an essence fixed, produced by nature's God;<br> The idol stamp is transitory;—soon downtrod.</p>
