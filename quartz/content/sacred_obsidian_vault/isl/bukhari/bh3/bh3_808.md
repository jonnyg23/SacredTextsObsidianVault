 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:809</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Umar bin Al-Khattab:</i></p>
 People were (sometimes) judged by the revealing of a Divine 
 Inspiration during the lifetime of Allah's Apostle but now there is no
 longer any more (new revelation). Now we judge you by the deeds you 
 practice publicly, so we will trust and favor the one who does good 
 deeds in front of us, and we will not call him to account about what 
 he is really doing in secret, for Allah will judge him for that; but 
 we will not trust or believe the one who presents to us with an evil 
 deed even if he claims that his intentions were good.
