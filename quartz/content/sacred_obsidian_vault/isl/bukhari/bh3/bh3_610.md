 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:611</h3><p><i>Narrated Zaid bin Khalid:</i></p>
 A man came and asked Allah's Apostle about picking a lost thing. The 
 Prophet said, "Remember the description of its container and the 
 string it is tied with, and make public announcement about it for one 
 year. If the owner shows up, give it to him; otherwise, do whatever 
 you like with it." He then asked, "What about a lost sheep?" The 
 Prophet said, "It is for you, for your brother (i.e. its owner), or 
 for the wolf." He further asked, "What about a lost camel?" The 
 Prophet said, "It is none of your concern. It has its water-container 
 (reservoir) and its feet, and it will reach water and drink it and eat
 the trees till its owner finds it."
