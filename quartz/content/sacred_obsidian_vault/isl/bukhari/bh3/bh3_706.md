 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:707</h3><p><i>Narrated Qais:</i></p>
 When Abu Huraira accompanied by his slave set out intending to embrace
 Islam they lost each other on the way. The slave then came while Abu 
 Huraira was sitting with the Prophet. The Prophet said, "O Abu 
 Huraira! Your slave has come back." Abu Huraira said, "Indeed, I would
 like you to witness that I have manumitted him." That happened at the 
 time when Abu Huraira recited (the following poetic verse):-- 'What a 
 long tedious tiresome night! Nevertheless, it has delivered us From 
 the land of Kufr (disbelief).
