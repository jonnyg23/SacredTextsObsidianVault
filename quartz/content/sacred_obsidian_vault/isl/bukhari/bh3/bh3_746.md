 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:747</h3><p><i>Narrated As-Sa'b bin Jaththama:</i></p>
 An onager was presented to Allah's Apostle at the place called 
 Al-Abwa' or Waddan, but Allah's Apostle rejected it. When the Prophet 
 noticed the signs of sorrow on the giver's face he said, "We have not 
 rejected your gift, but we are in the state of Ihram." (i.e. if we 
 were not in a state of Ihram we would have accepted your gift, 
 Fateh-al-Bari page 130, Vol. 6)
