 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:191</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Aisha:</i></p>
 The Prophet never fasted in any month more than in the month of 
 Sha'ban. He used to say, "Do those deeds which you can do easily, as 
 Allah will not get tired (of giving rewards) till you get bored and 
 tired (of performing religious deeds)." The most beloved prayer to the
 Prophet was the one that was done regularly (throughout the life) even
 if it were little. And whenever the Prophet offered a prayer he used 
 to offer it regularly .
