 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:719</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 I have loved the people of the tribe of Bani Tamim ever since I heard,
 three things, Allah's Apostle said about them. I heard him saying, 
 These people (of the tribe of Bani Tamim) would stand firm against 
 Ad-Dajjal." When the Sadaqat (gifts of charity) from that tribe came, 
 Allah's Apostle said, "These are the Sadaqat (i.e. charitable gifts) 
 of our folk." 'Aisha had a slave-girl from that tribe, and the Prophet
 said to 'Aisha, "Manumit her as she is a descendant of Ishmael (the 
 Prophet)."
