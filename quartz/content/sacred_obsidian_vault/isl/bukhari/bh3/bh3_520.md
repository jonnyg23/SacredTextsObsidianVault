 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:521</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar:</i></p>
 The Prophet concluded a contract with the people of Khaibar to utilize
 the land on the condition that half the products of fruits or 
 vegetation would be their share. The Prophet used to give his wives 
 one hundred Wasqs each, eighty Wasqs of dates and twenty Wasqs of 
 barley. (When 'Umar became the Caliph) he gave the wives of the 
 Prophet the option of either having the land and water as their 
 shares, or carrying on the previous practice. Some of them chose the 
 land and some chose the Wasqs, and 'Aisha chose the land.
