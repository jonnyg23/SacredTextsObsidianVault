 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:363</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira and Zaid bin Khalid:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle was asked about the slave-girl, if she was a virgin 
 and committed illegal sexual intercourse. The Prophet said, "If she 
 committed illegal sexual intercourse, lash her, and if she did it a 
 second time, then lash her again, and if she repeated the third time, 
 then sell her even for a hair rope." Ibn Shihab said, "I don't know 
 whether to sell her after the third or fourth offense."
