 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:746</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas:</i></p>
 We chased a rabbit at Mar-al-Zahran and the people ran after it but 
 were exhausted. I overpowered and caught it, and gave it to Abu Talha 
 who slaughtered it and sent its hip or two thighs to Allah's Apostle.

 that. (The sub-narrator asked Anas, "Did the Prophet; eat from it?" 
 Anas replied, "He ate from it.")
