 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:464</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Aisha:</i></p>
 The Prophet and Abu Bakr employed a (pagan) man from the tribe of Bani
 Ad-Dail and the tribe of Bani 'Abu bin 'Adi as a guide. He was an 
 expert guide and he broke the oath contract which he had to abide by 
 with the tribe of Al-'Asi bin Wail and he was on the religion of 
 Quraish pagans. The Prophet and Abu Bakr had confidence in him and 
 gave him their riding camels and told him to bring them to the Cave of
 Thaur after three days. So, he brought them their two riding camels 
 after three days and both of them (The Prophet and Abu Bakr) set out 
 accompanied by 'Amir bin Fuhaira and the Dili guide who guided them 
 below Mecca along the road leading to the sea-shore.
