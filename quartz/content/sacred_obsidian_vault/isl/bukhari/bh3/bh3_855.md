 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:856</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas:</i></p>
 It was said to the Prophet "Would that you see Abdullah bin Ubai." So,
 the Prophet went to him, riding a donkey, and the Muslims accompanied 
 him, walking on salty barren land. When the Prophet reached 'Abdullah 
 bin Ubai, the latter said, "Keep away from me! By Allah, the bad smell
 of your donkey has harmed me." On that an Ansari man said (to 
 'Abdullah), "By Allah! The smell of the donkey of Allah's Apostle is 
 better than your smell." On that a man from 'Abdullah's tribe got 
 angry for 'Abdullah's sake, and the two men abused each other which 
 caused the friends of the two men to get angry, and the two groups 
 started fighting with sticks, shoes and hands. We were informed that 
 the following Divine Verse was revealed (in this concern):-- "And if 
 two groups of Believers fall to fighting then, make peace between 
 them."   (49.9)
