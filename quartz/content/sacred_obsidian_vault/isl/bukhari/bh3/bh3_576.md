 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:577</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 A man came to the Prophet and demanded a camel (the Prophet owed him).
 Allah's Apostle told his companions to give him (a camel). They said, 
 "We do not find except an older camel (than what he demands). (The 
 Prophet ordered them to give him that camel). The man said, "You have 
 paid me in full and may Allah also pay you in full." Allah's Apostle 
 said, "Give him, for the best amongst the people is he who repays his 
 debts in the most handsome manner."
