 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:879</h3><p><i>Narrated Jabir:</i></p>
 While I was riding a (slow) and tired camel, the Prophet passed by and
 beat it and prayed for Allah's Blessings for it. The camel became so 
 fast as it had never been before. The Prophet then said, "Sell it to 
 me for one Uqiyya (of gold)." I said, "No." He again said, "Sell it to
 me for one Uqiyya (of gold)." I sold it and stipulated that I should 
 ride it to my house. When we reached (Medina) I took that camel to the
 Prophet and he gave me its price. I returned home but he sent for me 
 (and when I went to him) he said, "I will not take your camel. Take 
 your camel as a gift for you." (Various narrations are mentioned here 
 with slight variations in expressions relating the condition that 
 Jabir had the right to ride the sold camel up to Medina).
