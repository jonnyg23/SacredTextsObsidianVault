 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:895</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn 'Umar:</i></p>
 Umar bin Khattab got some land in Khaibar and he went to the Prophet 
 to consult him about it saying, "O Allah' Apostle got some land in 
 Khaibar better than which I have never had, what do you suggest that I
 do with it?" The Prophet said, "If you like you can give the land as 
 endowment and give its fruits in charity." So Umar gave it in charity 
 as an endowment on the condition that would not be sold nor given to 
 anybody as a present and not to be inherited, but its yield would be 
 given in charity to the poor people, to the Kith and kin, for freeing 
 slaves, for Allah's Cause, to the travelers and guests; and that there
 would be no harm if the guardian of the endowment ate from it 
 according to his need with good intention, and fed others without 
 storing it for the future."
