 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:155</h3><p><i>Narrated Humran:</i></p>
 I saw 'Uthman performing ablution; he washed his hands thrice, rinsed 
 his mouth and then washed his nose, by putting water in it and then 
 blowing it out, and washed his face thrice, and then washed his right 
 forearm up to the elbow thrice, and then the left-forearm up to the 
 elbow thrice, then smeared his head with water, washed his right foot 
 thrice, and then his left foot thrice and said, "I saw Allah's Apostle
 performing ablution similar to my present ablution, and then he said, 
 'Whoever performs ablution like my present ablution and then offers 
 two Rakat in which he does not think of worldly things, all his 
 previous sins will be forgiven."
