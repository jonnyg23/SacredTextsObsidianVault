 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:745</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas:</i></p>
 Once Allah's Apostle visited us in this house of ours and asked for 
 something to drink. We milked one of our sheep and mixed it with water
 from this well of ours and gave it to him. Abu Bakr was sitting on his
 left side and 'Umar in front of him and a bedouin on his right side. 
 When Allah's Apostle finished, 'Umar said to Allah's Apostle "Here is 
 Abu Bakr." But Allah's Apostle gave the remaining milk to the bedouin 
 and said twice, "The (persons on the) right side! So, start from the 
 right side." Anas added, "It is a Sunna (the Prophet's traditions)" 
 and repeated it thrice.
