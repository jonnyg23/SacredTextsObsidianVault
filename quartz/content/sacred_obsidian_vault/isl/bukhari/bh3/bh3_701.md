 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:702</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn 'Umar:</i></p>
 That he used to give his verdict regarding the male or female slaves 
 owned by more than one master, one of whom may manumit his share of 
 the slave. Ibn 'Umar used to say in such a case, "The manumitted 
 should manumit the slave completely if he has sufficient money to pay 
 the rest of the price of that slave (which is to be justly estimated) 
 and the other share-holders are to take the price of their shares and 
 the slave is freed (released from slavery)." Ibn 'Umar narrated this 
 verdict from the Prophet.
