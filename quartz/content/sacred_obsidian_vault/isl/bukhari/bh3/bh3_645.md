 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:646</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "A man felt very thirsty while he was on the way, 
 there he came across a well. He went down the well, quenched his 
 thirst and came out. Meanwhile he saw a dog panting and licking mud 
 because of excessive thirst. He said to himself, "This dog is 
 suffering from thirst as I did." So, he went down the well again and 
 filled his shoe with water and watered it. Allah thanked him for that 
 deed and forgave him. The people said, "O Allah's Apostle! Is there a 
 reward for us in serving the animals?" He replied: "Yes, there is a 
 reward for serving any animate (living being)." (See Hadith No. 551)
