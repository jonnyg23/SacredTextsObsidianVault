 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:804</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Umar bin Al-Khatab:</i></p>
 Once I gave a horse (for riding) in Allah's Cause. Later I saw it 
 being sold. I asked Allah's Apostle (whether I could buy it). He said,
 "Don't buy it, for you should not get back what you have given in 
 charity."
