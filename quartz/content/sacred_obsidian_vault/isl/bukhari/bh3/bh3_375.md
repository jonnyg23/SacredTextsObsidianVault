 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:378</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar:</i></p>
 Aisha, (mother of the faithful believers) wanted to buy a slave girl 
 and manumit her, but her masters said that they would sell her only on
 the condition that her Wala' would be for them. 'Aisha told Allah's 
 Apostle of that. He said, "What they stipulate should not hinder you 
 from buying her, as the Wala' is for the manumitted."
