 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:849</h3><p><i>Narrated Said bin Jubair:</i></p>
 A Jew from Hira asked me which one of the two periods Musa (i.e. 
 Prophet Moses) completed. I said, "I don't know, (but wait) till I see

 'Abbas and asked him. He replied, "Moses completed the longer and 
 better period." Ibn 'Abbas added, "No doubt, an apostle of Allah 
 always does what he says."
