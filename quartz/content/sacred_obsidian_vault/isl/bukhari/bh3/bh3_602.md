 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:603</h3><p><i>Narrated Aisha:</i></p>
 Abu bin Zam'a and Sad bin Abi Waqqas carried the case of their claim 
 of the (ownership) of the son of a slave-qirl of Zam'a before the 
 Prophet. Sad said, "O Allah's Apostle! My brother, before his death, 
 told me that when I would return (to Mecca), I should search for the 
 son of the slave-girl of Zam'a and take him into my custody as he was 
 his son." 'Abu bin Zam'a said, 'the is my brother and the son of the 
 slave-girl of my father, and was born or my father's bed." The Prophet
 noticed a resemblance between Utba and the boy but he said, "O 'Abu 
 bin Zam'a! You will get this boy, as the son goes to the owner of the 
 bed. You, Sauda, screen yourself from the boy."
