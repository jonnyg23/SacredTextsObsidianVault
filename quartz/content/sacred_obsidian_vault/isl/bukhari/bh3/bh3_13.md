 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:14</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Aisha:</i></p>
 We set out with Allah's Apostle shortly before the appearance of the 
 new moon of Dhi-l-Hiija and he said, "Whoever wants to assume Ihram 
 for 'Umra may do so, and whoever wants to assume Ihram for Hajj may do
 so. Had not I brought the Hadi with me, I would have assumed Ihram for
 'Umra." Some of the people assumed Ihram for 'Umra while others for 
 Hajj. I was amongst those who had assumed Ihram for 'Umra. I got my 
 menses before entering Mecca, and was menstruating till the day of 
 'Arafat. I complained to Allah's Apostle about it, he said, "Abandon 
 your 'Umra, undo and comb your hair, and assume Ihram for Hajj." So, I
 did that accordingly. When it was the night of Hasba (day of departure
 from Mina), the Prophet sent 'Abdur Rahman with me to At-Tanim.
 <p>
 The sub-narrator adds: He ('AbdurRahman) let her ride behind him. And 
 she assumed Ihram for 'Umra in lieu of the abandoned one. Aisha 
 completed her Hajj and 'Umra, and no Hadi, Sadaqa (charity), or 
 fasting was obligatory for her.
