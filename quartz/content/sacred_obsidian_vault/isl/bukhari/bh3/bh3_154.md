 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:157</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 While we were sitting with the Prophet a man came and said, "O Allah's
 Apostle! I have been ruined." Allah's Apostle asked what was the 
 matter with him. He replied "I had sexual intercourse with my wife 
 while I was fasting." Allah's Apostle asked him, "Can you afford to 
 manumit a slave?" He replied in the negative. Allah's Apostle asked 
 him, "Can you fast for two successive months?" He replied in the 
 negative. The Prophet asked him, "Can you afford to feed sixty poor 
 persons?" He replied in the negative. The Prophet kept silent and 
 while we were in that state, a big basket full of dates was brought to
 the Prophet . He asked, "Where is the questioner?" He replied, "I (am 
 here)." The Prophet said (to him), "Take this (basket of dates) and 
 give it in charity." The man said, "Should I give it to a person 
 poorer than I? By Allah; there is no family between its (i.e. 
 Medina's) two mountains who are poorer than I." The Prophet smiled 
 till his pre-molar teeth became visible and then said, 'Feed your 
 family with it."
