 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:843</h3><p><i>Narrated Talha bin 'Ubaidullah:</i></p>
 A man came to Allah's Apostle asking him about Islam, Allah's Apostle 
 said, "You have to offer five compulsory prayers in a day and a night 
 (24 hours)." The man asked, "Is there any more compulsory prayers for 
 me?" Allah's Apostle said, "No, unless you like to offer Nawafil (i.e.
 optional prayers)." Allah's Apostle then added, "You have to observe 
 fasts during the month of Ramadan." The man said, "Am I to fast any 
 other days?' Allah's Apostle said, "No, unless you wish to observe the
 optional fast voluntarily." Then Allah's Apostle told him about the 
 compulsory Zakat. The man asked, "Do I have to give anything besides?"
 Allah's Apostle said, "No, unless you wish to give in charity 
 voluntarily." So, the man departed saying, "By Allah I will neither do
 more nor less than that." Allah's Apostle said, "If he has said the 
 truth he will be successful."
