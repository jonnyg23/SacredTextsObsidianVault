 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:868</h3><p><i>Narrated Aisha:</i></p>
 Once Allah's Apostle heard the loud voices of some opponents 
 quarreling at the door. One of them was appealing to the other to 
 deduct his debt and asking him to be lenient but the other was saying,
 "By Allah I will not do so." Allah's Apostle went out to them and 
 said, "Who is the one who was swearing by Allah that he would not do a
 favor?" That man said, "I am that person, O Allah's Apostle! I will 
 give my opponent whatever he wishes."
