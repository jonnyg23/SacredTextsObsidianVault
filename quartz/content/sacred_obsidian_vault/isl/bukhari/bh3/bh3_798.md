 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:799</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn Shihab Az-Zuhri:</i></p>
 Anas bin Malik said, "When the emigrants came Medina, they had nothing
 whereas the Ansar had land and property. The Ansar gave them their 
 land on condition that the emigrants would give them half the yearly 
 yield and work on the land and provide the necessaries for 
 cultivation." His (i.e. Anas's mother who was also the mother of 
 'Abdullah bin Abu Talha, gave some date-palms to Allah' Apostle who 
 gave them to his freed slave-girl (Um Aiman) who was also the mother 
 of Usama bin Zaid. When the Prophet finished from the fighting against
 the people of Khaibar and returned to Medina, the emigrants returned 
 to the Ansar the fruit gifts which the Ansar had given them. The 
 Prophet also returned to Anas's mother the date-pallms. Allah's 
 Apostle gave Um Aiman other trees from his garden in lieu of the old 
 gift.
