 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:283</h3><p><i>Narrated Qatada:</i></p>
 Anas went to the Prophet with barley bread having some dissolved fat 
 on it. The Prophet had mortgaged his armor to a Jew in Medina and took
 from him some barley for his family. Anas heard him saying, "The 
 household of Muhammad did not possess even a single Sa of wheat or 
 food grains for the evening meal, although he has nine wives to look 
 after." (See Hadith No. 685)
