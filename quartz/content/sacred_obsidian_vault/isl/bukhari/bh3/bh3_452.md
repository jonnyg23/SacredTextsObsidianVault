 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:455</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:</i></p>
 The Prophet came to Medina and the people used to pay in advance the 
 prices of fruits to be delivered within two to three years. The 
 Prophet said (to them), "Buy fruits by paying their prices in advance 
 on condition that the fruits are to be delivered to you according to a
 fixed specified measure within a fixed specified period." Ibn Najih 
 said, " ... by specified measure and specified weight."
