 Allah's Apostle came to me and I told him about the slave-girl

 for the one who manumits." In the evening the Prophet got up and 
 glorified Allah as He deserved and then said, "Why do some people

 Whoever imposes such a condition as is not in Allah's Laws, then that 
 condition is invalid even if he imposes one hundred conditions, for 
 Allah's conditions are more binding and reliable."
