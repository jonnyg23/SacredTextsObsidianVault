 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:556</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "May Allah be merciful to the mother of Ishmael! If 
 she had left the water of Zam-Zam (fountain) as it was, (without 
 constructing a basin for keeping the water), (or said, "If she had not
 taken handfuls of its water"), it would have been a flowing stream. 
 Jurhum (an Arab tribe) came and asked her, 'May we settle at your 
 dwelling?' She said, 'Yes, but you have no right to possess the 
 water.' They agreed."
