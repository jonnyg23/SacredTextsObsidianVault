 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:551</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle said, "While a man was walking he felt thirsty and 
 went down a well and drank water from it. On coming out of it, he saw 
 a dog panting and eating mud because of excessive thirst. The man 
 said, 'This (dog) is suffering from the same problem as that of mine. 
 So he (went down the well), filled his shoe with water, caught hold of
 it with his teeth and climbed up and watered the dog. Allah thanked 
 him for his (good) deed and forgave him." The people asked, "O Allah's
 Apostle! Is there a reward for us in serving (the) animals?" He 
 replied, "Yes, there is a reward for serving any animate."
