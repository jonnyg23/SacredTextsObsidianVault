 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:573</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Dhar:</i></p>
 Once, while I was in the company of the Prophet, he saw the mountain 
 of Uhud and said, "I would not like to have this mountain turned into 
 gold for me unless nothing of it, not even a single Dinar remains of 
 it with me for more than three days (i.e. I will spend all of it in 
 Allah's Cause), except that Dinar which I will keep for repaying 
 debts." Then he said, "Those who are rich in this world would have 
 little reward in the Hereafter except those who spend their money here
 and there (in Allah's Cause), and they are few in number." Then he 
 ordered me to stay at my place and went not far away. I heard a voice 
 and intended to go to him but I remembered his order, "Stay at your 
 place till I return." On his return I said, "O Allah's Apostle! (What 
 was) that noise which I heard?" He said, "Did you hear anything?" I 
 said, "Yes." He said, "Gabriel came and said to me, 'Whoever amongst 
 your followers dies, worshipping none along with Allah, will enter 
 Paradise.' " I said, "Even if he did such-and-such things (i.e. even 
 if he stole or committed illegal sexual intercourse)" He said, "Yes."
