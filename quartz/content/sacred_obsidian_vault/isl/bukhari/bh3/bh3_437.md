 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:440</h3><p><i>Narrated Aun bin Abu Juhaifa:</i></p>
 I saw my father buying a slave whose profession was cupping, and 
 ordered that his instruments (of cupping) be broken. I asked him the 
 reason for doing so. He replied, "Allah's Apostle prohibited taking 
 money for blood, the price of a dog, and the earnings of a slave-girl 
 by prostitution; he cursed her who tattoos and her who gets tattooed, 
 the eater of Riba (usury), and the maker of pictures."
