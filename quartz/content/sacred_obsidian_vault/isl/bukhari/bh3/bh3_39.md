 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:40</h3><p><i>Narrated Nafi:</i></p>
 When Abdullah bin 'Umar set out for Mecca with the intentions 
 performing 'Umra in the period of afflictions, he said, "If I should 
 be prevented from reaching the Ka'ba, then I would do the same as we 
 did while in the company of Allah's Apostle ." So, he assumed the 
 Ihram for 'Umra since the Prophet had assumed the Ihram for 'Umra in 
 the year of Al-Hudaibiya. Then 'Abdullah bin 'Umar thought about it 
 and said, "The conditions for both Hajj and 'Umra are similar." He 
 then turned towards his companions and said, "The conditions of both 
 Hajj and 'Umra are similar and I make you witnesses that I have made 
 the performance of Hajj obligatory for myself along with 'Umra." He 
 then performed one Tawaf (between As-Safa and Al-Marwa) for both of 
 them (i.e. Hajj and ('Umra) and considered that to be sufficient for 
 him and offered a Hadi.
