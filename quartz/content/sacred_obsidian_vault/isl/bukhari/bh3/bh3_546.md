 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:547</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle said, "There are three persons whom Allah will not 
 look at on the Day of Resurrection, nor will he purify them and theirs
 shall be a severe punishment. They are:
 <p>
 1. A man possessed superfluous water, on a way and he withheld it from
 travelers.
 </p><p>
 2. A man who gave a pledge of allegiance to a ruler and he gave it 
 only for worldly benefits. If the ruler gives him something he gets 
 satisfied, and if the ruler withholds something from him, he gets 
 dissatisfied.
 </p><p>
 3. And man displayed his goods for sale after the 'Asr prayer and he 
 said, 'By Allah, except Whom None has the right to be worshipped, I 
 have been given so much for my goods,' and somebody believes him (and 
 buys them)."
 </p><p>
 The Prophet then recited: "Verily! Those who purchase a little gain at
 the cost of Allah's Covenant and their oaths."   (3.77)
