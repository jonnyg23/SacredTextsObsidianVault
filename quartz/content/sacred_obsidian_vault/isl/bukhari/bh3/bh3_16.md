 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:17</h3><p><i>Narrated Safwan bin Ya'la bin Umaiya from his father who said:</i></p>
 "A man came to the Prophet while he was at Ji'rana. The man was 
 wearing a cloak which had traces of Khaluq or Sufra (a kind of 
 perfume). The man asked (the Prophet ), 'What do you order me to 
 perform in my 'Umra?' So, Allah inspired the Prophet divinely and he 
 was screened by a place of cloth. I wished to see the Prophet being 
 divinely inspired. 'Umar said to me, 'Come! Will you be pleased to 
 look at the Prophet while Allah is inspiring him?' I replied in the 
 affirmative. 'Umar lifted one corner of the cloth and I looked at the 
 Prophet who was snoring. (The sub-narrator thought that he said: The 
 snoring was like that of a camel). When that state was over, the 
 Prophet asked, "Where is the questioner who asked about 'Umra? Put off
 your cloak and wash away the traces of Khaluq from your body and clean
 the Sufra (yellow color) and perform in your Umra what you perform in 
 your Hajj (i.e. the Tawaf round the Ka'ba and the Sa'i between Safa 
 and Marwa). "
