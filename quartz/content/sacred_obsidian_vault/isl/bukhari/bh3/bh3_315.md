 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:318</h3><p><i>Narrated Aisha:</i></p>
 (mother of the faithful believers)  I bought a cushion with pictures 
 on it. When Allah's Apostle saw it, he kept standing at the door and 
 did not enter the house. I noticed the sign of disgust on his face, so
 I said, "O Allah's Apostle! I repent to Allah and H is Apostle . 
 (Please let me know) what sin I have done." Allah's Apostle said, 
 "What about this cushion?" I replied, "I bought it for you to sit and 
 recline on." Allah's Apostle said, "The painters (i.e. owners) of 
 these pictures will be punished on the Day of Resurrection. It will be
 said to them, 'Put life in what you have created (i.e. painted).' " 
 The Prophet added, "The angels do not enter a house where there are 
 pictures."
