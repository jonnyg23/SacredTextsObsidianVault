 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:304</h3><p><i>Narrated Khabbab:</i></p>
 I was a blacksmith in the Pre-lslamic period, and 'Asi bin Wail owed 
 me some money, so I went to him to demand it. He said (to me), "I will
 not pay you unless you disbelieve Muhammad." I said, "I will not 
 disbelieve till Allah kills you and then you get resurrected." He 
 said, "Leave me till I die and get resurrected, then I will be given 
 wealth and children and I will pay you your debt." On that occasion it
 was revealed to the Prophet:
 <p>
 'Have you seen him who disbelieved in Our signs and says: Surely I 
 will be given wealth and children? Has he known the unseen, or has he 
 taken a covenant from the Beneficent (Allah)? (19.77-78)
