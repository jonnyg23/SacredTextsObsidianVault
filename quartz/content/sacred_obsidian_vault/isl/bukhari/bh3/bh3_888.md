 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:889</h3><p><i>Narrated Urwa:</i></p>
 Aisha said, "Buraira came to me and said, 'My people (masters) have 
 written the contract for my emancipation for nine Awaq  ) of gold) to 
 be paid in yearly installments, one Uqiyya per year; so help me." 
 Aisha said (to her), "If your masters agree, I will pay them the whole
 sum provided the Wala will be for me." Buraira went to her masters and
 told them about it, but they refused the offer and she returned from 
 them while Allah's Apostles was sitting. She said, "I presented the 
 offer to them, but they refused unless the Wala' would be for them." 
 When the Prophet heard that and 'Aisha told him about It, he said to 
 her, "Buy Buraira and let them stipulate that her Wala' will be for 
 them, as the Wala' is for the manumitted." 'Aisha did so. After that 
 Allah's Apostle got up amidst the people, Glorified and Praised Allah 
 and said, "What is wrong with some people who stipulate things which 
 are not in Allah's Laws? Any condition which is not in Allah's Laws is
 invalid even if there were a hundred such conditions. Allah's Rules 
 are the most valid and Allah's Conditions are the most solid. The Wala
 is for the manumitted."
