 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:295</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Mas'ud:</i></p>
 An Ansari man, called Abu Shu'aib, came and told his butcher slave, 
 "Prepare meals sufficient for five persons, for I want to invite the 
 Prophet along with four other persons as I saw signs of hunger on his 
 face." Abu Shu'aib invited them and another person came along with 
 them. The Prophet said (to Abu Shu'aib), This man followed us, so if 
 you allow him, he will join us, and if you want him to return, he will
 go back." Abu Shu'aib said, "No, I have allowed him (i.e. he, too, is 
 welcomed to the meal)."
