 The Prophet said, "Allah has forbidden for you, (1) to be undutiful to
 your mothers, (2) to bury your daughters alive, (3) to not to pay the 
 rights of the others (e.g. charity, etc.) and (4) to beg of men 
 (begging). And Allah has hated for you (1) vain, useless talk, or that
 you talk too much about others, (2) to ask too many questions, (in 
 disputed religious matters) and (3) to waste the wealth (by 
 extravagance).
