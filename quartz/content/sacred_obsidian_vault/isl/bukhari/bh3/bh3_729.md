 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:730</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdullah:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle said, "Everyone of you is a guardian and is 
 responsible for his charges. The ruler who has authority over people, 
 is a guardian and is responsible for them, a man is a guardian of his

 ('Abu) is a guardian of his master's property and is responsible for 
 it; so all of you are guardians and are responsible for your 
 charges."
