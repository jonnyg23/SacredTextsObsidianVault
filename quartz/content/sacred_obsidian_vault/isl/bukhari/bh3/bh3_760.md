 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:761</h3><p><i>Narrated Az-Zuhari:</i></p>
 Ubaidullah bin 'Abdullah told me that 'Aisha had said, "When the 
 Prophet became sick and his condition became serious, he requested his
 wives to allow him to be treated in my house, and they allowed him. He
 came out leaning on two men while his feet were dragging on the 
 ground. He was walking between Al-'Abbas and another man." 'Ubaidullah
 said, "When I informed Ibn 'Abbas of what 'Aisha had said, he asked me
 whether I knew who was the second man whom 'Aisha had not named. I 
 replied in the negative. He said, 'He was 'Ali bin Abi Talib."
