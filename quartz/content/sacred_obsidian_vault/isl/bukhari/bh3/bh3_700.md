 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:701</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn 'Umar:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "He who manumits his share of a slave and has money 
 sufficient to free the remaining portion of that slave's price (justly
 estimated) then he should manumit him (by giving the rest of his price
 to the other co-owners)." Nafi' added, "Otherwise the slave is 
 partially free." Aiyub is not sure whether the last statement was said
 by Nafi' or it was a part of the Hadith.
