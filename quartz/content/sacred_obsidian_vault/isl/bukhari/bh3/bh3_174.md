 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:177</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdullah bin Abi Aufa"</i></p>
 We were traveling with Allah's Apostle and he was fasting, and when 
 the sun set, he said to (someone), "Get down and mix Sawiq with water 
 for us." He replied, "O Allah's Apostle! (Will you wait) till it is 
 evening?" The Prophet again said, "Get down and mix Sawiq with water 
 for us." He replied, "O Allah's Apostle! It is still daytime." The 
 Prophet said again, "Get down and mix Sawiq with water for us." So, he
 got down and carried out that order. The Prophet then said, "When you 
 see night falling from this side, the fasting person should break his 
 fast," and he beckoned with his finger towards the east.
