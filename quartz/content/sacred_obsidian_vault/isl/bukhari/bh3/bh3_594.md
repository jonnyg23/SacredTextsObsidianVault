 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:595</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</i></p>
 While Allah's Apostle was sitting, a Jew came and said, "O Abul Qasim!
 One of your companions has slapped me on my face." The Prophet asked 
 who that was. He replied that he was one of the Ansar. The Prophet 
 sent for him, and on his arrival, he asked him whether he had beaten 
 the Jew. He (replied in the affirmative and) said, "I heard him taking
 an oath in the market saying, 'By Him Who gave Moses superiority over 
 all the human beings.' I said, 'O wicked man! (Has Allah given Moses 
 superiority) even over Muhammad I became furious
 <p>
 and slapped him over his face." The Prophet said, "Do not give a 
 prophet superiority over another, for on the Day of Resurrection all 
 the people will fall unconscious and I will be the first to emerge 
 from the earth, and will see Moses standing and holding one of the 
 legs of the Throne. I will not know whether Moses has fallen 
 unconscious or the first unconsciousness was sufficient for him."
