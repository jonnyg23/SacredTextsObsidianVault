 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:699</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn 'Umar:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle said, "Whoever manumits his share of a slave, then it 
 is essential for him to get that slave manumitted' completely as long 
 as he has the money to do so. If he has not sufficient money to pay 
 the price of the other shares (after the price of the slave is 
 evaluated justly), the manumitted manumits the slave partially in 
 proportion to his share.
