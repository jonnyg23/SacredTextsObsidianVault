 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:788</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn 'Umar:</i></p>
 Umar saw a silken cloak over a man for sale and requested the Prophet 
 to buy it in order to wear it on Fridays and while meeting delegates. 
 The Prophet said, "This is worn by the one who will have no share in 
 the Hereafter." Later on Allah's Apostle got some silken cloaks 
 similar to that one, and he sent one to 'Umar. 'Umar said to the 
 Prophet "How can I wear it, while you said about it what you said?" 
 The Prophet said, "I have not given it to you to wear, but to sell or 
 to give to someone else." So, 'Umar sent it to his brother at Mecca 
 before he embraced Islam.
