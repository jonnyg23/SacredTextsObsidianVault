 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:360</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle said, "Do not go forward to meet the caravan (to buy 
 from it on the way before it reaches the town). And do not urge buyers
 to cancel their purchases to sell them (your own goods) yourselves, 
 and do not practice Najsh. A town dweller should not sell the goods 
 for the desert dweller. Do not leave sheep unmilked for a long time, 
 when they are on sale, and whoever buys such an animal has the option 
 of returning it, after milking it, along with a Sa of dates or keeping
 it. it has been kept unmilked for a long period by the seller (to 
 deceive others).
