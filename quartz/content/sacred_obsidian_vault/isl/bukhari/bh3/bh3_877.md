 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:878</h3><p><i>Narrated Urwa:</i></p>
 Aisha told me that Buraira came to seek her help in writing for 
 emancipation and at that time she had not paid any part of her price. 
 'Aisha said to her, "Go to your masters and if they agree that I will 
 pay your price (and free you) on condition that your Wala' will be for
 me, I will pay the money." Buraira told her masters about that, but 
 they refused, and said, "If 'Aisha wants to do a favor she could, but 
 your Wala will be for us." Aisha informed Allah's Apostle of that and 
 he said to her, "Buy and manumit Buraira as the Wala' will go to the 
 manumitted."
