 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:539</h3><p><i>Narrated Sahl bin Sad:</i></p>
 We used to be very happy on Friday as an old lady used to cut some 
 roots of the Silq, which we used to plant on the banks of our small 
 water streams, and cook them in a pot of her's, adding to them, some 
 grains of barley. (Ya'qub, the sub-narrator said, "I think the 
 narrator mentioned that the food did not contain fat or melted fat 
 (taken from meat).") When we offered the Friday prayer we would go to 
 her and she would serve us with the dish. So, we used to be happy on 
 Fridays because of that. We used not to take our meals or the midday 
 nap except after the Jumua prayer (i.e. Friday prayer) .
