 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:266</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:</i></p>
 'Ukaz, Majanna and Dhul-Majaz were market-places in the Pre-lslamic 
 period of ignorance. When Islam came, Muslims felt that marketing 
 there might be a sin. So, the Divine Inspiration came: "There is no 
 harm for you to seek the bounty of your Lord (in the seasons of 
 Hajj)." (2.198) Ibn 'Abbas recited the Verse in this way.
