 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:639</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Amr:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "Whoever has (the following) four characters will be
 a hypocrite, and whoever has one of the following four characteristics
 will have one characteristic of hypocrisy until he gives it up. These 
 are: (1 ) Whenever he talks, he tells a lie; (2) whenever he makes a 
 promise, he breaks it; (3) whenever he makes a covenant he proves 
 treacherous; (4) and whenever he quarrels, he behaves impudently in an
 evil insulting manner." (See Hadith No. 33 Vol. 1)
