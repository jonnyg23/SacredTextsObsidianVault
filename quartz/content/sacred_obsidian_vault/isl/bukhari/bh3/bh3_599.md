 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:600</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdullah bin Ka'b bin Malik:</i></p>
 Ka'b demanded his debt back from Ibn Abi Hadrad in the Mosque and 
 their voices grew louder till Allah's Apostle heard them while he was 
 in his house. He came out to them raising the curtain of his room and 
 addressed Ka'b, "O Ka'b!" Ka'b replied, "Labaik, O Allah's Apostle." 
 (He said to him), "Reduce your debt to one half," gesturing with his 
 hand. Kab said, "I have done so, O Allah's Apostle!" On that the 
 Prophet said to Ibn Abi Hadrad, "Get up and repay the debt, to him."
