 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:140</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Adi bin Hatim:</i></p>

 to you, distinct from the black thread,' I took two (hair) strings, 
 one black and the other white, and kept them under my pillow and went

 out of it. So, the next morning I went to Allah's Apostle and told him
 the whole story. He explained to me, "That verse means the darkness of
 the night and the whiteness of the dawn."
