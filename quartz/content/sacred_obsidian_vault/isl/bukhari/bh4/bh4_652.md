 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:649</h3><p><i>Narrated Abdullah:</i></p>
 The Prophet mentioned the Massiah Ad-Dajjal in front of the people 
 saying, Allah is not one eyed while Messsiah, Ad-Dajjal is blind in 
 the right eye and his eye looks like a bulging out grape. While 
 sleeping near the Ka'ba last night, I saw in my dream a man of brown 
 color the best one can see amongst brown color and his hair was long 
 that it fell between his shoulders. His hair was lank and water was 
 dribbling from his head and he was placing his hands on the shoulders 
 of two men while circumambulating the Kaba. I asked, 'Who is this?' 
 They replied, 'This is Jesus, son of Mary.' Behind him I saw a man who
 had very curly hair and was blind in the right eye, resembling Ibn 
 Qatan (i.e. an infidel) in appearance. He was placing his hands on the
 shoulders of a person while performing Tawaf around the Ka'ba. I 
 asked, 'Who is this? 'They replied, 'The Masih, Ad-Dajjal.' "
