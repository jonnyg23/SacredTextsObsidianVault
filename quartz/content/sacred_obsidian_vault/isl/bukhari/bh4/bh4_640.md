 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:637</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle said, "My example and the example o the people is like
 that of a person who lit a fire and let the moths, butterflies and 
 these insects fall in it." He also said, "There were two women, each 
 of whom had a child with her. A wolf came and took away the child of 
 one of them, whereupon the other said, 'It has taken your child.' The 
 first said, 'But it has taken your child.' So they both carried the 
 case before David who judged that the living child be given to the 
 elder lady. So both of them went to Solomon bin David and informed him
 (of the case). He said, 'Bring me a knife so as to cut the child into 
 two pieces and distribute it between them.' The younger lady said, 
 'May Allah be merciful to you! Don't do that, for it is her (i.e. the 
 other lady's) child.' So he gave the child to the younger lady."
