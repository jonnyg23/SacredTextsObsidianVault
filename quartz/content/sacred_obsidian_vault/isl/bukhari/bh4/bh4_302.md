 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:298</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle delivered a sermon and said, "Zaid received the flag 
 and was martyred, then Ja'far took it and was martyred, then 'Abdullah
 bin Rawaha took it and was martyred, and then Khalid bin Al-Walid took
 it without being appointed, and Allah gave him victory." The Prophet 
 added, "I am not pleased (or they will not be pleased) that they 
 should remain (alive) with us," while his eyes were shedding tears.
