 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:201</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Aisha:</i></p>
 We set out in the company of Allah's Apostle five days before the end 
 of Dhul Qa'da intending to perform Hajj only. When we approached Mecca
 Allah's Apostle ordered those who did not have the Hadi (i.e. an 
 animal for sacrifice) with them, to perform the Tawaf around the 
 Ka'ba, and between Safa and Marwa and then finish their Ihram. Beef 
 was brought to us on the day of (i.e. the days of slaughtering) and I 
 asked, "What is this?" Somebody said, Allah's Apostle has slaughtered 
 (a cow) on behalf of his wives."
