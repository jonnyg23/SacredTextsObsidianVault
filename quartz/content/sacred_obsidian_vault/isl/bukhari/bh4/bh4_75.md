 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:75</h3><p><i>Narrated Muhammad bin Jubair:</i></p>
 Jubair bin Mut'im told me that while he was in the company of Allah's 
 Apostle with the people returning from Hunain, some people (bedouins) 
 caught hold of the Prophet and started begging of him so much so that 
 he had to stand under a (kind of thorny tree (i.e. Samurah) and his 
 cloak was snatched away. The Prophet stopped and said, "Give me my 
 cloak. If I had as many camels as these thorny trees, I would have 
 distributed them amongst you and you will not find me a miser or a 
 liar or a coward."
