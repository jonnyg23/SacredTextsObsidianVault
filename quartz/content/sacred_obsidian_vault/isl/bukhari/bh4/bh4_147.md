 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:146</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "A time will come when groups of people will go for 
 Jihad and it will be asked, 'Is there anyone amongst you who has 
 enjoyed the company of the Prophet?' The answer will be, 'Yes.' Then 
 they will be given victory (by Allah) (because of him). Then a time 
 will come when it will be asked. 'Is there anyone amongst you who has 
 enjoyed the company of the companions of the Prophet?' It will be 
 said, 'Yes,' and they will be given victory (by Allah). Then a time 
 will come when it will be said. 'Is there anyone amongst you who has 
 enjoyed the company of the companions of the companions of the 
 Prophet?' It will be said, 'Yes,' and they will be given victory (by 
 Allah)."
