 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:633</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn Abbas:</i></p>
 The prostration in Sura-Sad is not amongst the compulsory 
 prostrations, though I saw the Prophet prostrating on reciting The 
 Statement of Allah:--and to David We gave Solomon (for a son). How 
 excellent (a) slave he was ever oft-returning in repentance (to us) 
 (38.30) And His Statement:-- He said: My Lord Forgive me and grant me 
 a kingdom such as shall not belong to any other after me.' (38.35) And
 His Statement:-- 'And they followed what the Devils gave out 
 (falsely), of magic in the life-time of Solomon.' (2.102)
