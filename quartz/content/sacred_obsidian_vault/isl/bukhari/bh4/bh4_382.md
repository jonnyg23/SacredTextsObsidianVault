 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:378</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdullah:</i></p>
 On the day (of the battle) of Hunain, Allah's Apostle favored some 
 people in the distribution of the booty (to the exclusion of others); 
 he gave Al-Aqra' bin Habis one-hundred camels and he gave 'Uyaina the 
 same amount, and also gave to some of the eminent Arabs, giving them 
 preference in this regard. Then a person came and said, "By Allah, in 
 this distribution justice has not been observed, nor has Allah's 
 Pleasure been aimed at." I said (to him), "By Allah, I will inform the
 Prophet (of what you have said), "I went and informed him, and he 
 said, "If Allah and His Apostle did not act justly, who else would act
 justly. May Allah be merciful to Moses, for he was harmed with more 
 than this, yet he kept patient."
