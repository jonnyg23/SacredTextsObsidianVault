 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:491</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle said, "During your sleep, Satan knots three knots at 
 the back of the head of each of you, and he breathes the following 
 words at each knot, 'The night is, long, so keep on sleeping,' If that

 lively and gay, otherwise he gets up dull and gloomy. "
