 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:80</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 I went to Allah's Apostle while he was at Khaibar after it had fallen 
 in the Muslims' hands. I said, "O Allah's Apostle! Give me a share 
 (from the land of Khaibar)."
 <p>
 One of the sons of Sa'id bin Al-'As said, "O Allah's Apostle! Do not 
 give him a share." I said, "This is the murderer of Ibn Qauqal." The 
 son of Said bin Al-As said, "Strange! A Wabr (i.e. guinea pig) who has
 come down to us from the mountain of Qaduim (i.e. grazing place of 
 sheep) blames me for killing a Muslim who was given superiority by 
 Allah because of me, and Allah did not disgrace me at his hands (i.e. 
 was not killed as an infidel)." (The sub-narrator said "I do not know 
 whether the Prophet gave him a share or not.")
