 The Prophet said, "On the night of my Ascent to the Heaven, I saw 
 Moses who was a tall brown curly-haired man as if he was one of the 
 men of Shan'awa tribe, and I saw Jesus, a man of medium height and 
 moderate complexion inclined to the red and white colors and of lank 
 hair. I also saw Malik, the gate-keeper of the (Hell) Fire and 
 Ad-Dajjal amongst the signs which Allah showed me." (The Prophet then 
 recited the Holy Verse): "So be not you in doubt of meeting him' when 
 you met Moses during the night of Mi'raj over the heavens" (32.23)
 <p>
 Medina from Ad-Dajjal (who will not be able to enter the city of 
 Medina)."
