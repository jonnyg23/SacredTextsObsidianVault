 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:365</h3><p><i>Narrated Jabir:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle said (to me), "If the property of Bahrain had come to 
 us, I would have given you so much and so much." But the Bahrain 
 property did not come till the Prophet had died. When the Bahrain 
 property came. Abu Bakr ordered somebody to announce, "Any person who 
 has money claim on Allah's Apostle or whom Allah's Apostle had 
 promised something, should come to us." So, I went to him and said, 
 "Allah's Apostle had promised to give me so much an so much." Abu Bakr
 scooped up money with both hands thrice for me." (The sub-narrator 
 Sufyan illustrated this action by scooping up with both hands and

 this way.")

 did not give me, and I went to him again, but he did not give me, so I
 went to him for the third time and said, "I asked you, but you did not
 give me; then I asked you (for the second time) and you did not give 
 me; then I asked you (for the third time) but you did not give me. You
 should either give me or allow yourself to be considered a miser 
 regarding my case." Abu Bakr said, "You tell me that I am a miser with
 regard to you. But really, whenever I rejected your request, I had the
 inclination to give you."

 (In another narration Jabir added:) So, Abu Bakr scooped up money with
 both hands for me and asked me to count it. I found out that It was 
 five hundred. Abu Bakr told me to take twice that amount.
