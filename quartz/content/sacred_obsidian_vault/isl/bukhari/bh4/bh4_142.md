 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:141</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "Charity is obligatory everyday on every joint of a 
 human being. If one helps a person in matters concerning his riding 
 animal by helping him to ride it or by lifting his luggage on to it, 
 all this will be regarded charity. A good word, and every step one 
 takes to offer the compulsory Congregational prayer, is regarded as 
 charity; and guiding somebody on the road is regarded as charity."
