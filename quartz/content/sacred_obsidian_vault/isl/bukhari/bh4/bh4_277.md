 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:274</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Hazim:</i></p>
 The people asked Sahl bin Sad As-Sa' idi "With what thing (medicine) 
 was the wound of Allah's Apostle treated?" He replied, "There is none 
 left (living) amongst the people who knows it better than. 'Ali used 
 to bring water in his shield and Fatima (i.e. the Prophet's daughter) 
 used to wash the blood off his face. Then a mat (of palm leaves) was 
 burnt and its ash was inserted in the wound of Allah's Apostle."
