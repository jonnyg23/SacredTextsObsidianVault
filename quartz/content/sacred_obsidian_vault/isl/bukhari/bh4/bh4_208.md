 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:207</h3><p><i>Narrated Yazid bin Ubaid:</i></p>
 Salama said, "I gave the Pledge of allegiance (Al-Ridwan) to Allah's 
 Apostle and then I moved to the shade of a tree. When the number of 
 people around the Prophet diminished, he said, 'O Ibn Al-Akwa ! Will 
 you not give to me the pledge of Allegiance?' I replied, 'O Allah's 
 Apostle! I have already given to you the pledge of Allegiance.' He 
 said, 'Do it again.' So I gave the pledge of allegiance for the second
 time." I asked 'O Abu Muslim! For what did you give he pledge of 
 Allegiance on that day?" He replied, "We gave the pledge of Allegiance
 for death."
