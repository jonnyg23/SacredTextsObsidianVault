 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:446</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "Angels keep on descending from and ascending to the
 Heaven in turn, some at night and some by daytime, and all of them 
 assemble together at the time of the Fajr and 'Asr prayers. Then those
 who have stayed with you over-night, ascent unto Allah Who asks them, 
 and He knows the answer better than they, "How have you left My 
 slaves?" They reply, "We have left them praying as we found them 
 praying." If anyone of you says "Amin" (during the Prayer at the end 
 of the recitation of Surat-al-Faitiha), and the angels in Heaven say 
 the same, and the two sayings coincide, all his past sins will be 
 forgiven."
