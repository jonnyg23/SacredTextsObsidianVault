 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:603</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Urwa:</i></p>
 I asked 'Aisha the wife of the Prophet about the meaning of the 
 following Verse: -- "(Respite will be granted) 'Until when the 
 apostles give up hope (of their people) and thought that they were 
 denied (by their people)..............."(12.110) 'Aisha replied, 
 "Really, their nations did not believe them." I said, "By Allah! They 
 were definite that their nations treated them as liars and it was not 
 a matter of suspecting." 'Aisha said, "O 'Uraiya (i.e. 'Urwa)! No 
 doubt, they were quite sure about it."
 <p>
 I said, "May the Verse be read in such a way as to mean that the 
 apostles thought that Allah did not help them?" Aisha said, "Allah 
 forbid! (Impossible) The Apostles did not suspect their Lord of such a
 thing. But this Verse is concerned with the Apostles' followers who 
 had faith in their Lord and believed in their apostles and their 
 period of trials was long and Allah's Help was delayed till the 
 apostles gave up hope for the conversion of the disbelievers amongst 
 their nation and suspected that even their followers were shaken in 
 Prophet said, "The honorable, the son of the honorable, the son of the
 honorable, (was) Joseph, the son of Jacob! the son of Isaac, the son 
 of Abraham."
