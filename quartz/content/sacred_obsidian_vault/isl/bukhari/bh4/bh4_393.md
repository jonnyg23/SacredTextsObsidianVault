 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:389</h3><p><i>Narrated Yahya bin Said:</i></p>
 Once the Prophet called the Ansar in order to grant them part of the 
 land of Bahrain. On that they said, "No! By Allah, we will not accept 
 it unless you grant a similar thing to our Quarries brothers as well."

 persisted in their request, he said, "After me you will see others 
 given preference over you in this respect (in which case) you should 
 be patient till you meet me at the Tank (of Al-Kauthar)."
