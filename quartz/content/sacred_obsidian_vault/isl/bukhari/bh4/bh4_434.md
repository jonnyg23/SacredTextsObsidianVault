 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:430</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdullah bin Mus'ud:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle, the true and truly inspired said, "(The matter of the
 Creation of) a human being is put together in the womb of the mother 
 in forty days, and then he becomes a clot of thick blood for a similar
 period, and then a piece of flesh for a similar period. Then Allah 
 sends an angel who is ordered to write four things. He is ordered to 
 write down his (i.e. the new creature's) deeds, his livelihood, his 
 (date of) death, and whether he will be blessed or wretched (in 
 religion). Then the soul is breathed into him. So, a man amongst you 
 may do (good deeds till there is only a cubit between him and Paradise
 and then what has been written for him decides his behavior and he 
 starts doing (evil) deeds characteristic of the people of the (Hell) 
 Fire. And similarly a man amongst you may do (evil) deeds till there 
 is only a cubit between him and the (Hell) Fire, and then what has 
 been written for him decides his behavior, and he starts doing deeds 
 characteristic of the people of Paradise."
