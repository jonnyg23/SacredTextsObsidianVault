 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:428</h3><p><i>Narrated Ata:</i></p>
 'Aisha said If the Prophet saw a cloud In the sky, he would walk to 
 and fro in agitation, go out and come in, and the color of his face 
 would change, and if it rained, he would feel relaxed." So 'Aisha knew
 that state of his. So the Prophet said, I don't know (am afraid), it 
 may be similar to what happened to some people referred to in the Holy
 Quran in the following Verse: -- "Then when they saw it as a dense 
 cloud coming towards their valleys, they said, 'This is a cloud 
 bringing us rain!' Nay, but, it is that (torment) which you were 
 asking to be hastened a wind wherein is severe torment." (46.24)
