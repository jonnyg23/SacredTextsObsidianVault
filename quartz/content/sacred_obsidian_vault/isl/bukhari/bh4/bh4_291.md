 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:288</h3><p><i>Narrated Said bin Jubair:</i></p>
 Ibn 'Abbas said, "Thursday! What (great thing) took place on 
 Thursday!" Then he started weeping till his tears wetted the gravels 
 of the ground . Then he said, "On Thursday the illness of Allah's 
 Apostle was aggravated and he said, "Fetch me writing materials so 
 that I may have something written to you after which you will never go
 astray." The people (present there) differed in this matter and people
 should not differ before a prophet. They said, "Allah's Apostle is 
 seriously sick.' The Prophet said, "Let me alone, as the state in 
 which I am now, is better than what you are calling me for." The 
 Prophet on his death-bed, gave three orders saying, "Expel the pagans 
 from the Arabian Peninsula, respect and give gifts to the foreign 
 delegates as you have seen me dealing with them." I forgot the third 
 (order)" (Ya'qub bin Muhammad said, "I asked Al-Mughira bin 
 'Abdur-Rahman about the Arabian Peninsula and he said, 'It comprises 
 Mecca, Medina, Al-Yama-ma and Yemen." Ya'qub added, "And Al-Arj, the 
 beginning of Tihama.")
