 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:74</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle said, "Once Solomon, son of David said, '(By Allah) 
 Tonight I will have sexual intercourse with one hundred (or 
 ninety-nine) women each of whom will give birth to a knight who will 
 fight in Allah's Cause.' On that a (i.e. if Allah wills) but he did 
 not say, 'Allah willing.' Therefore only one of those women conceived 
 and gave birth to a half-man. By Him in Whose Hands Muhammad's life 
 is, if he had said, "Allah willing', (he would have begotten sons) all
 of whom would have been knights striving in Allah's Cause."
