 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:529</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Mulaika:</i></p>
 Ibn Umar used to kill snakes, but afterwards he forbade their killing 
 and said, "Once the Prophet pulled down a wall and saw a cast-off skin
 of a snake in it. He said, 'Look for the snake. 'They found it and the
 Prophet said, "Kill it." For this reason I used to kill snakes. Later 
 on I met Abu Lubaba who told me the Prophet said, 'Do not kill snakes 
 except the short-tailed or mutilated-tailed snake with two white lines
 on its back, for it causes abortion and makes one blind. So kill it.'
