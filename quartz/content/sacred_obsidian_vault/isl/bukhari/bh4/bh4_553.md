 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:550</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "Allah has appointed an angel in the womb, and the 
 angel says, 'O Lord! A drop of discharge (i.e. of semen), O Lord! a 
 clot, O Lord! a piece of flesh.' And then, if Allah wishes to complete
 the child's creation, the angel will say. 'O Lord! A male or a female?
 O Lord! wretched or blessed (in religion)? What will his livelihood 
 be? What will his age be?' The angel writes all this while the child 
 is in the womb of its mother."
