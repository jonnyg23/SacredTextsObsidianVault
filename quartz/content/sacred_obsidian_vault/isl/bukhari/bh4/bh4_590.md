 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:587</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Aisha:</i></p>
 (the wife of the Prophet) Allah's Apostle said (to her). "Don't you 
 see that when your folk built the Ka'ba, they did not build it on all 
 the foundations built by Abraham?" I said, "O Allah's Apostle! Why 
 don't we rebuild it on the foundations of Abraham?" He said. "But for 
 the fact that your folk have recently given up infidelity (I would 
 have done so)."
 <p>
 I see that Allah's Apostle used not to touch the two corners facing 
 Al-Hijr only because the House had not been built on the foundations 
 of Abraham''
