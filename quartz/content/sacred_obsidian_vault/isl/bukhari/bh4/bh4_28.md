 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:29</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas:</i></p>
 When Allah's Apostle came to Medina; he did not have any servant. Abu 
 Talha (Anas' step-father) took me to Allah's Apostle and said, "O 
 Allah's Apostle! Anas is a wise boy, so let him serve you." So, I 
 served him at home and on journeys. If I did anything, he never asked 
 me why I did it, and if I refrained from doing anything, he never 
 asked me why I refrained from doing it.
