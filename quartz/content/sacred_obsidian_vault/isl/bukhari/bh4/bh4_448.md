 Once Umar bin Abdul Aziz delayed the 'Asr prayer a little. 'Urwa said 
 to him, "Gabriel descended and led the prayer in front of the Prophet 
 " On that 'Umar said, "O Urwa! Be sure of what you say." "Urwa, "I 
 heard Bashir bin Abi Masud narrating from Ibn Masud who heard Allah's 
 Apostle saying, 'Gabriel descended and led me in prayer; and then 
 prayed with him again, and then prayed with him again, and then prayed
 with him again, and then prayed with him again, counting with his 
 fingers five prayers."
