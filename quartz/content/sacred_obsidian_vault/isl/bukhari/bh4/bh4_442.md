 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:438</h3><p><i>Narrated Aisha:</i></p>
 Al Harith bin Hisham asked the Prophet, "How does the divine 
 inspiration come to you?" He replied, "In all these ways: The Angel 
 sometimes comes to me with a voice which resembles the sound of a

 Angel has said, and this type of Divine Inspiration is the hardest on 
 me; and  sometimes the Angel comes to me in the shape of a man and 
 talks to me, and I understand and remember what he says."
