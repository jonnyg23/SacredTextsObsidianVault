 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:232</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle said, "There is a (compulsory) Sadaqa (charity) to be 
 given for every joint of the human body (as a sign of gratitude to 
 Allah) everyday the sun rises. To judge justly between two persons is 
 regarded as Sadaqa, and to help a man concerning his riding animal by 
 helping him to ride it or by lifting his luggage on to it, is also 
 regarded as Sadaqa, and (saying) a good word is also Sadaqa, and every
 step taken on one's way to offer the compulsory prayer (in the mosque)
 is also Sadaqa and to remove a harmful thing from the way is also 
 Sadaqa."
