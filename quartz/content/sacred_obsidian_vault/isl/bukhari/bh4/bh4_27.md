 The Prophet said, "Avoid the seven great destructive sins." The people

 in worship along with Allah, to practice sorcery, to kill the life 
 which Allah has forbidden except for a just cause, (according to 
 Islamic law), to eat up Riba (usury), to eat up an orphan's wealth, to
 give back to the enemy and fleeing from the battlefield at the time of
 fighting, and to accuse, chaste women, who never even think of 
 anything touching chastity and are good believers.
