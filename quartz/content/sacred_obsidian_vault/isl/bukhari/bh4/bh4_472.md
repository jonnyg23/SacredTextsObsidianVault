 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:468</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle said, "The first group (of people) who will enter 
 Paradise will be (glittering) like the moon when it is full. They will
 not spit or blow their noses or relieve nature. Their utensils will be
 of gold and their combs of gold and silver; in their centers the aloe 
 wood will be used, and their sweat will smell like musk. Everyone of 
 them will have two wives; the marrow of the bones of the wives' legs 
 will be seen through the flesh out of excessive beauty. They ( i.e. 
 the people of Paradise) will neither have differences nor hatred 
 amongst themselves; their hearts will be as if one heart and they will
 be glorifying Allah in the morning and in the evening."
