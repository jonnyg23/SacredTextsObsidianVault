 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:181</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Ishaq:</i></p>
 A man asked Al-Bara', "O Abu 'Umara! Did you all flee on the day (of 
 the battle) of Hunain?" He replied, "No, by Allah! Allah's Apostle did
 not flee, but his young unarmed companions passed by the archers of 
 the tribe of Hawazin and Bani Nasr whose arrows hardly missed a 
 target, and they threw arrows at them hardly missing a shot. So the 
 Muslims retreated towards the Prophet while he was riding his white 
 mule which was being led by his cousin Abu Sufyan bin Al-Harith bin 
 'Abdul Muttalib. The Prophet dismounted and invoked Allah for victory;
 then he said, 'I am the Prophet, without a lie; I am the son of 'Abdul
 Muttalib, and then he arranged his companions in rows."
