 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:156</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas:</i></p>
 The 'Prophet was the best and the bravest amongst the people. Once the
 people of Medina got terrified at night, so they went in the direction
 of the noise (that terrified them). The Prophet met them (on his way 
 back) after he had found out the truth. He was riding an unsaddled 
 horse belonging to Abu Talha and a sword was hanging by his neck, and 
 he was saying, "Don't be afraid! Don't be afraid!" He further said, "I
 found it (i.e. the horse) very fast," or said, "This horse is very 
 fast." (Qastala-ni)
