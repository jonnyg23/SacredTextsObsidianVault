 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:403</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Amr:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle said, "Whoever has (the following) four 
 characteristics will be a pure hypocrite: "If he speaks, he tells a 
 lie; if he gives a promise, he breaks it, if he makes a covenant he 
 proves treacherous; and if he quarrels, he behaves in a very imprudent
 evil insulting manner (unjust). And whoever has one of these 
 characteristics, has one characteristic of a hypocrite, unless he 
 gives it us."
