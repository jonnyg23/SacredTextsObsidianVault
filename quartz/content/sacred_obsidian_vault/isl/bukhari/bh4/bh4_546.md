 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:543</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "Allah created Adam, making him 60 cubits tall. When
 He created him, He said to him, "Go and greet that group of angels, 
 and listen to their reply, for it will be your greeting (salutation) 
 and the greeting (salutations of your offspring." So, Adam said (to 
 the angels), As-Salamu Alaikum (i.e. Peace be upon you). The angels 
 said, "As-salamu Alaika wa Rahmatu-l-lahi" (i.e. Peace and Allah's 
 Mercy be upon you). Thus the angels added to Adam's salutation the 
 expression, 'Wa Rahmatu-l-lahi,' Any person who will enter Paradise 
 will resemble Adam (in appearance and figure). People have been 
 decreasing in stature since Adam's creation.
