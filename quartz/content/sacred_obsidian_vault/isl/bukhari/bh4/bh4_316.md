 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:312</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Uthman An-Nahdi:</i></p>
 Mujashi (bin Mas'ud) took his brother Mujalid bin Musud to the Prophet
 and said, "This is Mujalid and he will give a pledge of allegiance to 
 you for migration." The Prophet said, "There is no migration after the
 Conquest of Mecca, but I will take his pledge of allegiance for 
 Islam."
