 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:44</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 A man came to Allah's Apostle and said, "Instruct me as to such a deed
 as equals Jihad (in reward)." He replied, "I do not find such a deed."
 Then he added, "Can you, while the Muslim fighter is in the 
 battle-field, enter your mosque to perform prayers without cease and 
 fast and never break your fast?" The man said, "But who can do that?" 
 Abu- Huraira  added, "The Mujahid (i.e. Muslim fighter) is rewarded 
 even for the footsteps of his horse while it wanders bout (for 
 grazing) tied in a long rope."
