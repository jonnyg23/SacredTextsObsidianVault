 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:408</h3><p><i>Narrated Al-Bara:</i></p>
 When the Prophet intended to perform the 'Umra he sent a person to the
 people of Mecca asking their permission to enter Mecca. They 
 stipulated that he would not stay for more than three days and would 
 not enter it except with sheathed arms and would not preach (Islam) to
 any of them. So Ali bin Abi-Talib started writing the treaty between 
 them. He wrote, "This is what Muhammad, Apostle of Allah has agreed 
 to." The (Meccans) said, "If we knew that you (Muhammad) are the 
 Apostle of Allah, then we would not have prevented you and would have 
 followed you. But write, 'This is what Muhammad bin 'Abdullah has 
 agreed to..' " On that Allah's Apostle said, "By Allah, I am Muhammad 
 bin 'Abdullah, and, by Allah, I am Apostle of 'Allah." Allah's Apostle
 used not to write; so he asked 'Ali to erase the expression of Apostle
 of Allah. On that 'Ali said, "By Allah I will never erase it." Allah's
 Apostle said (to 'Ali), "Let me see the paper." When 'Ali showed him 
 the paper, the Prophet erased the expression with his own hand. When 
 Allah's Apostle had entered Mecca and three days had elapsed, the 
 Meccans came to 'Ali and said, "Let your friend (i.e. the Prophet) 
 quit Mecca." Ali informed Allah's Apostle about it and Allah's Apostle
 said, "Yes," and then he departed.
