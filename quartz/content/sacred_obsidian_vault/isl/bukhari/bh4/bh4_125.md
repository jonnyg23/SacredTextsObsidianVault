 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:124</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas:</i></p>
 The Prophet had a she camel called Al Adba which could not be excelled
 in a race. (Humaid, a sub-narrator said, "Or could hardly be 
 excelled.") Once a bedouin came riding a camel below six years of age 
 which surpasses it (i.e. Al'Adba) in the race. The Muslims felt it so 
 much that the Prophet noticed their distress. He then said, "It is 
 Allah's Law that He brings down whatever rises high in the world."
