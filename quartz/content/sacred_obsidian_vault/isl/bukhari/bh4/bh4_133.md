 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:132</h3><p><i>Narrated Tha'laba bin Abi Malik:</i></p>
 'Umar bin Al-Khattab distributed some garments amongst the women of 
 Medina. One good garment remained, and one of those present with him 
 said, "O chief of the believers! Give this garment to your wife, the 
 (grand) daughter of Allah's Apostle." They meant Um Kulthum, the 
 daughter of 'Ali. 'Umar said, Um Salit has more right (to have it)." 
 Um Salit was amongst those Ansari women who had given the pledge of 
 allegiance to Allah's Apostle.' 'Umar said, "She (i.e. Um Salit) used 
 to carry the water skins for us on the day of Uhud."
