 When the helmet of the Prophet was smashed on his head and blood 
 covered his face and one of his front teeth got broken, 'Ali brought

 But when she saw that the bleeding increased more by the water, she 
 took a mat, burnt it, and placed the ashes on the wound of the Prophet
 and so the blood stopped oozing out.
