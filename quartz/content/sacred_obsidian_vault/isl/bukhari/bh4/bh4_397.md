 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:393</h3><p><i>Narrated Said bin Jubair:</i></p>
 that he heard Ibn 'Abbas saying, "Thursday! And you know not what 
 Thursday is? After that Ibn 'Abbas wept till the stones on the ground 
 were soaked with his tears. On that I asked Ibn 'Abbas, "What is 
 (about) Thursday?" He said, "When the condition (i.e. health) of 
 Allah's Apostle deteriorated, he said, 'Bring me a bone of scapula, so
 that I may write something for you after which you will never go 
 astray.'The people differed in their opinions although it was improper
 to differ in front of a prophet, They said, 'What is wrong with him? 
 Do you think he is delirious? Ask him (to understand). The Prophet 
 replied, 'Leave me as I am in a better state than what you are asking 
 me to do.' Then the Prophet ordered them to do three things saying, 
 'Turn out all the pagans from the Arabian Peninsula, show respect to 
 all foreign delegates by giving them gifts as I used to do.' " The 
 sub-narrator added, "The third order was something beneficial which 
 either Ibn 'Abbas did not mention or he mentioned but I forgot.'
