 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:449</h3><p><i>Narrated Busr bin Said:</i></p>
 That Zaid bin Khalid Al-Juhani narrated to him something in the 
 presence of Said bin 'Ubaidullah Al-Khaulani who was brought up in the
 house of Maimuna the wife of the Prophet. Zaid narrated to them that 
 Abu Talha said that the Prophet said, "The Angels (of Mercy) do not 
 enter a house wherein there is a picture." Busr said, "Later on Zaid 
 bin Khalid fell ill and we called on him. To our surprise we saw a 
 curtain decorated with pictures in his house. I said to Ubaidullah 
 Al-Khaulani, "Didn't he (i.e. Zaid) tell us about the (prohibition of)
 pictures?" He said, "But he excepted the embroidery on garments. 
 Didn't you hear him?" I said, "No." He said, "Yes, he did."
