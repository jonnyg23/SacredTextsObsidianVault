 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:41</h3><p><i>Narrated Abdullah bin Masud:</i></p>
 I asked Allah's Apostle, "O Allah's Apostle! What is the best deed?" 
 He replied, "To offer the prayers at their early stated fixed times." 
 I asked, "What is next in goodness?" He replied, "To be good and

 He replied, "To participate in Jihad in Allah's Cause." I did not ask 
 Allah's Apostle anymore and if I had asked him more, he would have 
 told me more.
