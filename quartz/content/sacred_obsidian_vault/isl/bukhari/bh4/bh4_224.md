 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:222</h3><p><i>Narrated Asma:</i></p>
 I prepared the journey-food for Allah's Apostle in Abu Bakr's house 
 when he intended to emigrate to Medina. I could not find anything to 
 tie the food-container and the water skin with. So, I said to Abu 
 Bakr, "By Allah, I do not find anything to tie (these things) with 
 except my waist belt." He said, "Cut it into two pieces and tie the 
 water-skin with one piece and the food-container with the other (the 
 sub-narrator added, "She did accordingly and that was the reason for 
 calling her Dhatun-Nitaqain (i.e. two-belted woman))."
