 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:395</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Asim:</i></p>
 I asked Anas about the Qunut (i.e. invocation in the prayer). Anas 
 said, "It should be recited before bowing." I said, "So-and-so claims 
 that you say that it should be recited after bowing." He replied, "He 
 is mistaken." Then Anas narrated to us that the Prophet invoked evil 
 on the tribe of Bani-Sulaim for one month after bowing. ' Anas Further
 said, "The Prophet had sent 40 or 70 Qaris (i.e. men well versed in 
 the knowledge of the Qur'an) to some pagans, but the latter struggled 
 with them and martyred them, although there was a peace pact between 
 them and the Prophet I had never seen the Prophet so sorry and worried
 about anybody as he was about them (i.e. the Qaris)."
