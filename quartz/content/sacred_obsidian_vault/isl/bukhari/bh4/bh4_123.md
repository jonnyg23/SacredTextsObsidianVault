 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:122</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Ishaq from Musa bin 'Uqba from Mafia from Ibn 'Umar who </i></p>
 said:
 <p>
 "Allah's Apostle arranged a horse race amongst the horses that had 
 been made lean, letting them start from Al-Hafya' and their limit 
 (distance of running) was up to Thaniyat-al-Wada'. I asked Musa, 'What
 was the distance between the two places?' Musa replied, 'Six or seven 
 miles. He arranged a race of the horses which had not been made lean 
 sending them from Thaniyat-al-Wada', and their limit was up to the 
 mosque of Bani Zuraiq.' I asked, 'What was the distance between those 
 two places?' He replied 'One mile or so.' Ibn 'Umar was amongst those 
 who participated in that horse race."
