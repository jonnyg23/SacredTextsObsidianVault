 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:574</h3><p><i>Narrated Mujahid:</i></p>
 That when the people mentioned before Ibn 'Abbas that the Dajjal would
 have the word Kafir, (i.e. unbeliever) or the letters Kafir (the root 
 of the Arabic verb 'disbelieve') written on his forehead, I heard Ibn 
 'Abbas saying, "I did not hear this, but the Prophet said, 'If you 
 want to see Abraham, then look at your companion (i.e. the Prophet)  
 but Moses was a curly-haired, brown man (who used to ride) a red 
 camel, the reins of which was made of fires of date-palms. As if I 
 were now looking down a valley."
