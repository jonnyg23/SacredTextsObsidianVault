 Allah's Apostle was the (most handsome), most generous and the bravest
 of all the people. Once the people of Medina got frightened having 
 heard an uproar at night. So, the Prophet met the people while he was 
 riding an unsaddled horse belonging to Abu Talha and carrying his 
 sword (slung over his shoulder). He said (to them), "Don't get scared,
 don't get scared." Then he added, "I found it (i.e the horse) very 
 fast."
