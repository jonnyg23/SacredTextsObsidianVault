 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:465</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 While we were in the company of the Prophet, he said, "While I was

 ablution beside a palace, I asked, To whom does this palace belong? 
 'They said, To 'Umar bin Al-Khattab.' Then I remembered 'Umar's Ghaira
 (concerning women), and so I quickly went away from that palace." 
 (When 'Umar heard this from the Prophet), he wept and said, "Do you 
 think it is likely that I feel Ghaira because of you, O Allah's 
 Apostle?"
