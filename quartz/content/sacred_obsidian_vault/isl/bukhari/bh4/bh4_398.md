 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:394</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 When Khaibar was conquered, a roasted poisoned sheep was presented to 
 the Prophets as a gift (by the Jews). The Prophet ordered, "Let all 
 the Jews who have been here, be assembled before me." The Jews were 
 collected and the Prophet said (to them), "I am going to ask you a 
 question. Will you tell the truth?'' They said, "Yes.' The Prophet 
 asked, "Who is your father?" They replied, "So-and-so." He said, "You 
 have told a ie; your father is so-and-so." They said, "You are right."
 He siad, "Will you now tell me the truth, if I ask you about 
 something?" They replied, "Yes, O AbuAl-Qasim; and if we should tell a
 lie, you can realize our lie as you have done regarding our father." 
 On that he asked, "Who are the people of the (Hell) Fire?" They said, 
 "We shall remain in the (Hell) Fire for a short period, and after that
 you will replace us." The Prophet said, "You may be cursed and 
 humiliated in it! By Allah, we shall never replace you in it.'' Then 
 he asked, "Will you now tell me the truth if I ask you a question?" 
 They said, "Yes, O Ab Li-AI-Qasim." He asked, "Have you poisoned this 
 sheep?" They said, "Yes." He asked, "What made you do so?" They said, 
 "We wanted to know if you were a liar in which case we would get rid 
 of you, and if you are a prophet then the poison would not harm you."
