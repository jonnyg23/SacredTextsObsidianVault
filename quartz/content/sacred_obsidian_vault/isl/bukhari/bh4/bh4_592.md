 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:589</h3><p><i>Narrated Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Laila:</i></p>
 Ka'b bin Ujrah met me and said, "Shall I not give you a present I got 
 from the Prophet?" 'Abdur-Rahman said, "Yes, give it to me." I said, 
 "We asked Allah's Apostle saying, 'O Allah's Apostle! How should one 
 (ask Allah to) send blessings on you, the members of the family, for 
 Allah has taught us how to salute you (in the prayer)?' He said, 'Say:
 O Allah! Send Your Mercy on Muhammad and on the family of Muhammad, as
 You sent Your Mercy on Abraham and on the family of Abraham, for You 
 are the Most Praise-worthy, the Most Glorious. O Allah! Send Your 
 Blessings on Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, as You sent your 
 Blessings on Abraham and on the family of Abraham, for You are the 
 Most Praise-worthy, the Most Glorious.' "
