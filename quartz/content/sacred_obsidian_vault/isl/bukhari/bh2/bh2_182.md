 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:183</h3><p><i>Narrated Rabi'a:</i></p>
 'Umar bin Al-Khattab recited Surat-an-Nahl on a Friday on the pulpit 
 and when he reached the verse of Sajda he got down from the pulpit and
 prostrated and the people also prostrated. The next Friday 'Umar bin 
 Al-Khattab recited the same Sura and when he reached the verse of 
 Sajda he said, "O people! When we recite the verses of Sajda (during 
 the sermon) whoever prostrates does the right thing, yet it is no sin 
 for the one who does not prostrate." And 'Umar did not prostrate (that
 day). Added Ibn 'Umar "Allah has not made the prostration of 
 recitation compulsory but if we wish we can do it."
