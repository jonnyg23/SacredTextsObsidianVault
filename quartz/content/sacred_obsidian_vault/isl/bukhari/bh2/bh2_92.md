 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:93</h3><p><i>Narrated Al-Bara':</i></p>
 The Prophet went towards Al-Baqi (the grave-yard at Medina) on the day
 of Id-ul-Adha and offered a two-Rakat prayer (of 'Id-ul-Adha) and then
 faced us and said, "On this day of ours, our first act of worship is 
 the offering of prayer and then we will return and slaughter the 
 sacrifice, and whoever does this concords with our Sunna; and whoever 
 slaughtered his sacrifice before that (i.e. before the prayer) then 
 that was a thing which he prepared earlier for his family and it would
 not be considered as a Nusuk (sacrifice.)" A man stood up and said, 
 "O, Allah's Apostle! I slaughtered (the animal before the prayer) but 
 I have a young she-goat which is better than an older sheep." The 
 Prophet (p.b.u.h) said to him, "Slaughter it. But a similar sacrifice 
 will not be sufficient for anybody else after you."
