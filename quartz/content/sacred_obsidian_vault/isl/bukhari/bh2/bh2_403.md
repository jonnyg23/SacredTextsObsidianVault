 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:402</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "When a funeral is ready and the men carry the 
 deceased on their necks (shoulders), if it was pious then it will say,
 'Present me quickly', and if it was not pious, then it will say, 'Woe 
 to it (me), where are they taking it (me)?' And its voice is heard by 
 everything except mankind and if he heard it he would fall 
 unconscious."
