 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:450</h3><p><i>Narrated Al-Bara' bin 'Azib :</i></p>
 The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, "When a faithful believer is made to sit 
 in his grave, then (the angels) come to him and he testifies that none
 has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is Allah's 
 Apostle. And that corresponds to Allah's statement: Allah will keep 
 firm those who believe with the word that stands firm . . . (14.27).
