 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:197</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar:</i></p>
 "I saw Allah's Apostle delaying the Maghrib prayer till he offered it 
 along with the 'Isha' prayer whenever he was in a hurry during the 
 journey." Salim narrated, "Ibn 'Umar used to do the same whenever he 
 was in a hurry during the journey." And Salim added, "Ibn 'Umar used 
 to pray the Maghrib and 'Isha' prayers together in Al-Muzdalifa." 
 Salim said, "Ibn 'Umar delayed the Maghrib prayer because at that time
 he heard the news of the death of his wife Safiya bint Abi 'Ubaid. I 
 said to him, 'The prayer (is due).' He said, 'Go on.' Again I said, 
 'The prayer (is due).' He said, 'Go on,' till we covered two or three 
 miles. Then he got down, prayed and said, 'I saw the Prophet praying 
 in this way, whenever he was in a hurry during the journey.'  
 'Abdullah (bin 'Umar) added, "Whenever the Prophet was in a hurry, he 
 used to delay the Maghrib prayer and then offer three Rakat (of the 
 Maghrib) and perform Taslim, and after waiting for a short while, 
 Iqama used to be pronounced for the 'Isha' prayer when he would offer 
 two Rakat and perform Taslim. He would never offer any optional prayer
 till the middle of the night (when he used to pray the Tahajjud)."
