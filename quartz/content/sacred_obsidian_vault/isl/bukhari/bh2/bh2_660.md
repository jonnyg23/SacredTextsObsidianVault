 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:658</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Usama bin Zaid:</i></p>
 I asked, "O Allah's Apostle! Where will you stay in Mecca? Will you 
 stay in your house in Mecca?" He replied, "Has 'Aqil left any property
 or house?" Aqil along with Talib had inherited the property of Abu 
 Talib. Jafar and Ali did not inherit anything as they were Muslims and
 the other two were non-believers. 'Umar bin Al-Khattab used to say, "A
 believer cannot inherit (anything from an) infidel." Ibn Shihab, (a 
 sub-narrator) said, "They (Umar and others) derived the above verdict 
 from Allah's Statement: "Verily! those who believed and Emigrated and 
 strove with their life And property in Allah's Cause, And those who 
 helped (the emigrants) And gave them their places to live in, These 
 are (all) allies to one another." (8.72)
