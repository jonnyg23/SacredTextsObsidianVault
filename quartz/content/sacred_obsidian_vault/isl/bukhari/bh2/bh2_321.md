 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:319</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira.</i></p>
 Once Allah's Apostle offered two Rakat and finished his prayer. So 
 Dhul-Yadain asked him, "Has the prayer been reduced or have you 
 forgotten?" Allah's Apostle said, "Has DhulYadain spoken the truth?" 
 The people replied in the affirmative. Then Allah's Apostle stood up 
 and offered the remaining two Rakat and performed Taslim, and then 
 said Takbir and performed two prostrations like his usual 
 prostrations, or a bit longer, and then got up.
