 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:109</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas bin Sirin:</i></p>
 I asked Ibn 'Umar, "What is your opinion about the two Rakat before 
 the Fajr (compulsory) prayer, as to prolonging the recitation in 
 them?" He said, "The Prophet (p.b.u.h) used to pray at night two Rakat
 followed by two and so on, and end the prayer by one Raka Witr. He 
 used to offer two Rakat before the Fajr prayer immediately after the 
 Adhan." (Hammad, the sub-narrator said, "That meant (that he prayed) 
 quickly.)"
