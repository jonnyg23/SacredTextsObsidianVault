 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:128</h3><p><i>Narrated Qatada:</i></p>
 Anas I said, "While Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) was delivering the 
 Friday Khutba (sermon) a man came and said, 'O Allah's Apostle! Rain 
 is scarce; please ask Allah to bless us with rain.' So he invoked 
 Allah for it, and it rained so much that we could hardly reach our 
 homes and it continued raining till the next Friday." Anas further 
 said, "Then the same or some other person stood up and said, 'O 
 Allah's Apostle! Invoke Allah to withhold the rain.' On that, Allah's 
 Apostle I said, 'O Allah! Round about us and not on us.' " Anas added,
 "I saw the clouds dispersing right and left and it continued to rain 
 but not over Medina."
