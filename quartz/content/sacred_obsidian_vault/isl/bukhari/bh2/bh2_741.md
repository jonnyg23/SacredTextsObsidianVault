 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:739</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdullah:</i></p>
 (the slave of Asma') During the night of Jam', Asma' got down at 
 Al-Muzdalifa and stood up for (offering) the prayer and offered the 
 prayer for some time and then asked, "O my son! Has the moon set?" I 
 replied in the negative and she again prayed for another period and 
 then asked, "Has the moon set?" I replied, "Yes." So she said that we 
 should set out (for Mina), and we departed and went on till she threw 
 pebbles at the Jamra (Jamrat-al-Aqaba) and then she returned to her 
 dwelling place and offered the morning prayer. I asked her, "O you! I 
 think we have come (to Mina) early in the night." She replied, "O my 
 son! Allah's Apostle gave permission to the women to do so."
