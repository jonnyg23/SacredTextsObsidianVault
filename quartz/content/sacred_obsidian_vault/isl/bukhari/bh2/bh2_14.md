 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:15</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Aisha:</i></p>
 AbdurRahman bin Abi Bakr came holding a Siwak with which he was 
 cleaning his teeth. Allah's Apostle looked at him. I requested 
 Abdur-Rahman to give the Siwak to me and after he gave it to me I 
 divided it, chewed it and gave it to Allah's Apostle. Then he cleaned 
 his teeth with it and (at that time) he was resting against my chest.
