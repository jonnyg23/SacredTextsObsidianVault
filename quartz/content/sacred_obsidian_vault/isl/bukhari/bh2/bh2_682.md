 A man asked Ibn 'Umar about the touching of the Black Stone. Ibn 'Umar
 said, "I saw Allah's Apostle touching and kissing it." The questioner 
 said, "But if there were a throng (much rush) round the Ka'ba and the 
 people overpowered me, (what would I do?)" He replied angrily, "Stay 
 in Yemen (as that man was from Yemen). I saw Allah's Apostle touching 
 and kissing it."
