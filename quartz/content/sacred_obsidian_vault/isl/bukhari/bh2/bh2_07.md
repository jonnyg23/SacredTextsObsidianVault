 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:8</h3><p><i>Narrated Salman-Al-Farsi:</i></p>
 The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, "Whoever takes a bath on Friday, purifies 
 himself as much as he can, then uses his (hair) oil or perfumes 
 himself with the scent of his house, then proceeds (for the Jumua 
 prayer) and does not separate two persons sitting together (in the 
 mosque), then prays as much as (Allah has) written for him and then 
 remains silent while the Imam is delivering the Khutba, his sins 
 in-between the present and the last Friday would be forgiven."
