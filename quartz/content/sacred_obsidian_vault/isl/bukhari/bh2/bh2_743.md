 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:741</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Aisha:</i></p>
 We got down at Al-Muzdalifa and Sauda asked the permission of the 
 Prophet to leave (early) before the rush of the people. She was a slow
 woman and he gave her permission, so she departed (from Al-Muzdalifa) 
 before the rush of the people. We kept on staying at Al-Muzdalifa till
 dawn, and set out with the Prophet but (I suffered so much that) I 
 wished I had taken the permission of Allah's Apostle as Sauda had 
 done, and that would have been dearer to me than any other happiness.
