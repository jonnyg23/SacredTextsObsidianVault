 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:293</h3><p><i>Narrated Sahl bin Sad:</i></p>
 The Prophet went out to affect a reconciliation between the tribes of 
 Bani 'Amr bin 'Auf and the time of the prayer became due; Bilal went 
 to Abu Bakr and said, "The Prophet is detained. Will you lead the 
 people in the prayer?" Abu Bakr replied, "Yes, if you wish." So Bilal 
 pronounced the Iqama and Abu Bakr led the prayer. In the meantime the 
 Prophet came crossing the rows (of the praying people) till he stood 
 in the first row and the people started clapping. Abu Bakr never 
 looked hither and thither during the prayer but when the people 
 clapped too much, he looked back and saw the Prophet in the (first) 
 row. The Prophet waved him to remain at his place, but Abu Bakr raised
 both his hands and sent praises to Allah and then retreated and the 
 Prophet went forward and led the prayer. (See Hadith No. 295 &amp; 296)
