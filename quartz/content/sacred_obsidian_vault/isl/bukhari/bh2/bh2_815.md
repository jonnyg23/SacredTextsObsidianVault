 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:813</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Ikrima:</i></p>
 The people of Medina asked Ibn Abbas about a woman who got her menses 
 after performing Tawaf-al-Ifada. He said, "She could depart (from 
 Mecca)." They said, "We will not act on your verdict and ignore the 
 verdict of Zaid." Ibn Abbas said, "When you reach Medina, inquire 
 about it." So, when they reached Medina they asked (about that). One 
 of those whom they asked was Um Sulaim. She told them the narration of
 Safiya (812).
