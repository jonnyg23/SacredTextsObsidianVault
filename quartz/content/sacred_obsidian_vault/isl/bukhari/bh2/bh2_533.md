 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:532</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</i></p>
 A Bedouin asked Allah's Apostle about the emigration. The Prophet 
 (p.b.u.h) said, "May Allah have mercy on you! The matter of emigration
 is very hard. Have you got camels? Do you pay their Zakat?" The 
 Bedouin said, "Yes, I have camels and I pay their Zakat." The Prophet 
 said, Work beyond the seas and Allah will not decrease (waste) any of 
 your good deeds." (See Hadith No. 260 Vol. 5).
