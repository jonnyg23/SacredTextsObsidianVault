 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:715</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdul 'Aziz bin Rufai:</i></p>
 I asked Anas bin Malik, "Tell me what you remember from Allah's 
 Apostle (regarding these questions): Where did he offer the Zuhr and 
 'Asr prayers on the day of Tarwiya (8th day of Dhul-Hajja)?" He 
 relied, "(He offered these prayers) at Mina." I asked, "Where did he 
 offer the 'Asr prayer on the day of Nafr (i.e. departure from Mina on 
 the 12th or 13th of Dhul-Hijja)?" He replied, "At Al-Abtah," and then 
 added, "You should do as your chiefs do."
