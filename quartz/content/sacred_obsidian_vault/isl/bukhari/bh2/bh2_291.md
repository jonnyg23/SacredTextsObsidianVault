 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:290</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdullah:</i></p>
 We used to greet the Prophet while he was praying and he used to 
 answer our greetings. When we returned from AnNajashi (the ruler of 
 Ethiopia), we greeted him, but he did not answer us (during the 
 prayer) and (after finishing the prayer) he said, "In the prayer one 
 is occupied (with a more serious matter)."
