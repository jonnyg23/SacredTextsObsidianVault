 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:551</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Urwa bin Az-Zubair and Said bin Al-Musaiyab:</i></p>
 Haklm bin Hizam said, "(Once) I asked Allah's Apostle (for something) 
 and he gave it to me. Again I asked and he gave (it to me). Again I 
 asked and he gave (it to me). And then he said, "O Hakim! This 
 property is like a sweet fresh fruit; whoever takes it without 
 greediness, he is blessed in it, and whoever takes it with greediness,
 he is not blessed in it, and he is like a person who eats but is never
 satisfied; and the upper (giving) hand is better than the lower 
 (receiving) hand." Hakim added, "I said to Allah's Apostle , 'By Him 
 (Allah) Who sent you with the Truth, I shall never accept anything 
 from anybody after you, till I leave this world.' " Then Abu Bakr 
 (during his caliphate) called Hakim to give him his share from the war
 booty (like the other companions of the Prophet ), he refused to 
 accept anything. Then 'Umar (during his caliphate) called him to give 
 him his share but he refused. On that 'Umar said, "O Muslims! I would 
 like you to witness that I offered Hakim his share from this booty and
 he refused to take it." So Hakim never took anything from anybody 
 after the Prophet till he died.
