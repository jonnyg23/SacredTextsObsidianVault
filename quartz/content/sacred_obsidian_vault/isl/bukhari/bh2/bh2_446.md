 The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, "Whoever intentionally swears falsely by a
 religion other than Islam, then he is what he has said, (e.g. if he 
 says, 'If such thing is not true then I am a Jew,' he is really a 
 Jew). And whoever commits suicide with piece of iron will be punished 
 Prophet said, "A man was inflicted with wounds and he committed 
 suicide, and so Allah said: My slave has caused death on himself 
 hurriedly, so I forbid Paradise for him."
