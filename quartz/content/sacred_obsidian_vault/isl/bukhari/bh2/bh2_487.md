 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:486</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle said, "Whoever is made wealthy by Allah and does not 
 pay the Zakat of his wealth, then on the Day of Resurrection his 
 wealth will be made like a bald-headed poisonous male snake with two 
 black spots over the eyes. The snake will encircle his neck and bite 
 his cheeks and say, 'I am your wealth, I am your treasure.' " Then the
 Prophet recited the holy verses:-- 'Let not those who withhold . . .' 
 (to the end of the verse). (3.180).
