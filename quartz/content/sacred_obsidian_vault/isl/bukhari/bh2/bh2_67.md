 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:68</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) offered the Fajr prayer when it was still 
 dark, then he rode and said, 'Allah Akbar! Khaibar is ruined. When we 
 approach near to a nation, the most unfortunate is the morning of 
 those who have been warned." The people came out into the streets 
 saying, "Muhammad and his army." Allah's Apostle vanquished them by 
 force and their warriors were killed; the children and women were 
 taken as captives. Safiya was taken by Dihya Al-Kalbi and later she 
 belonged to Allah's Apostle go who married her and her Mahr was her 
 manumission.
