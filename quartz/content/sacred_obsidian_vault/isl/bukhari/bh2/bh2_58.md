 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:59</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdullah bin  Umar:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle used to pray two Rakat before the Zuhr prayer and two 
 Rakat after it. He also used to pray two Rakat after the Maghrib 
 prayer in his house, and two Rakat after the 'Isha' prayer. He never 
 prayed after Jumua prayer till he departed (from the Mosque), and then
 he would pray two Rakat at home.
