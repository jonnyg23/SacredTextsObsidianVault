 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:33</h3><p><i>Narrated Salman Al-Farsi:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) said, "Anyone who takes a bath on Friday and
 cleans himself as much as he can and puts oil (on his hair) or scents 
 himself; and then proceeds for the prayer and does not force his way 
 between two persons (assembled in the mosque for the Friday prayer), 
 and prays as much as is written for him and remains quiet when the 
 Imam delivers the Khutba, all his sins in between the present and the 
 last Friday will be forgiven."
