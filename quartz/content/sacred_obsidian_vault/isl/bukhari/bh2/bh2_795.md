 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:793</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Amr bin Al-'As:</i></p>
 I witnessed the Prophet when he was delivering the sermon on the Day 
 of Nahr. A man stood up and said, "I thought that such and such was to
 be done before such and such. I got my hair shaved before 
 slaughtering." (Another said), "I slaughtered the Hadi before doing 
 the Rami." So, the people asked about many similar things. The Prophet
 said, "Do it (now) and there is no harm in all these cases." Whenever 
 the Prophet was asked about anything on that day, he replied, "Do it 
 (now) and there is no harm in it."
