 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:210</h3><p><i>Narrated Az-Zuhri:</i></p>
 Salim told me, "'Abdullah bin 'Umar said, 'I saw Allah's Apostle 
 delaying the Maghrib prayer till he offered it along with the Isha 
 prayer whenever he was in a hurry during the journey.' " Salim said, 
 "Abdullah bin Umar used to do the same whenever he was in a hurry 
 during the journey. After making the call for Iqama, for the Maghrib 
 prayer he used to offer three Rakat and then perform Tasllm. After 
 waiting for a short while, he would pronounce the Iqama for the 'Isha'
 prayer and offer two Rakat and perform Taslim. He never prayed any 
 Nawafil in between the two prayers or after the 'Isha' prayers till he
 got up in the middle of the night (for Tahajjud prayer)."
