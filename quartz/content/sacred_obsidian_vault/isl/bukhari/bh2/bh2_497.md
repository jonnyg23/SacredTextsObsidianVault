 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:496</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Masud:</i></p>
 When the verses of charity were revealed, we used to work as porters. 
 A man came and distributed objects of charity in abundance. And they 
 (the people) said, "He is showing off." And another man came and gave 
 a sa (a small measure of food grains); they said, "Allah is not in 
 need of this small amount of charity." And then the Divine Inspiration
 came: "Those who criticize such of the believers who give in charity 
 voluntarily and those who could not find to give in charity except 
 what is available to them." (9.79).
