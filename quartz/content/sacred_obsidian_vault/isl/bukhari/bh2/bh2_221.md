 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:222</h3><p><i>Narrated Salim's father:</i></p>
 In the life-time of the Prophet whosoever saw a dream would narrate it
 to Allah's Apostle. I had a wish of seeing a dream to narrate it to 
 Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) I was a grown up boy and used to sleep in 
 the Mosque in the life-time of the Prophet.  I saw in the dream that 
 two angels caught hold of me and took me to the Fire which was built 
 all round like a built well and had two poles in it and the people in 
 it were known to me. I started saying, "I seek refuge with Allah from 
 the Fire." Then I met another angel who told me not to be afraid. I 
 narrated the dream to Hafsa who told it to Allah's Apostle. The 
 Prophet said, "Abdullah is a good man. I wish he prayed Tahajjud." 
 After that 'Abdullah (i.e. Salim's father) used to sleep but a little 
 at night.
