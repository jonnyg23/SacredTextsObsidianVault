 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:407</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn Abbas:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle passed by a grave of a deceased who had been buried at
 night. He said, "When was this (deceased) buried?" The people said, 
 "Yesterday." He said, "Why did you not inform me?" They said, "We 
 buried him when it was dark and so we disliked to wake you up." He 
 stood up and we lined up behind him. (Ibn Abbas said): I was one of 
 them, and the Prophet offered the funeral prayer.
