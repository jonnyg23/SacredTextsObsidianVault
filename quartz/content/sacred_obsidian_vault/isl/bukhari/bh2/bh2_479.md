 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:478</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn Abbas:</i></p>
 Thy Prophet sent Muadh to Yemen and said, "Invite the people to 
 testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and I am 
 Allah's Apostle, and if they obey you to do so, then teach them that 
 Allah has enjoined on them five prayers in every day and night (in 
 twenty-four hours), and if they obey you to do so, then teach them 
 that Allah has made it obligatory for them to pay the Zakat from their
 property and it is to be taken from the wealthy among them and given 
 to the poor."
