 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:434</h3><p><i>Narrated Jabir:</i></p>
 When the time of the Battle of Uhud approached, my father called me at
 night and said, "I think that I will be the first amongst the 
 companions of the Prophet to be martyred. I do not leave anyone after 
 me dearer to me than you, except Allah's Apostle's soul and I owe some
 debt and you should repay it and treat your sisters favorably (nicely 
 and politely)." So in the morning he was the first to be martyred and 
 was buried along with another (martyr). I did not like to leave him 
 with the other (martyr) so I took him out of the grave after six 
 months of his burial and he was in the same condition as he was on the
 day of burial, except a slight change near his ear.
