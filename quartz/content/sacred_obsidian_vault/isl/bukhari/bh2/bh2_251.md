 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:251</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Aisha:</i></p>
 A woman from the tribe of Bani Asad was sitting with me and Allah's 
 Apostle (p.b.u.h) came to my house and said, "Who is this?" I said, 
 "(She is) So and so. She does not sleep at night because she is 
 engaged in prayer." The Prophet said disapprovingly: Do (good) deeds 
 which is within your capacity as Allah never gets tired of giving 
 rewards till you get tired of doing good deeds."
