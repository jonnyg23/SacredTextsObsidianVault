 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:528</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas:</i></p>
 Abu Bakr wrote to me what Allah had instructed His Apostle (p.b.u.h) 
 to do regarding the one who had to pay one Bint Makhad (i.e. one 
 year-old she-camel) as Zakat, and he did not have it but had got Bint 
 Labun (two year old she-camel). (He wrote that) it could be accepted 
 from him as Zakat, and the collector of Zakat would return him 20 
 Dirhams or two sheep; and if the Zakat payer had not a Bint Makhad, 
 but he had Ibn Labun (a two year old he-camel) then it could be 
 accepted as his Zakat, but he would not be paid anything .
