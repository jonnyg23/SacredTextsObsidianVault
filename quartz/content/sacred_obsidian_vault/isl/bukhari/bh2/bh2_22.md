 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:23</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn Umar:</i></p>
 One of the wives of  Umar (bin Al-Khattab) used to offer the Fajr and 
 the 'Isha' prayer in congregation in the Mosque. She was asked why she
 had come out for the prayer as she knew that  Umar disliked it, and he
 has great ghaira (self-respect). She replied, "What prevents him from 
 stopping me from this act?" The other replied, "The statement of 
 Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) : 'Do not stop Allah's women-slave from 
 going to Allah s Mosques' prevents him."
