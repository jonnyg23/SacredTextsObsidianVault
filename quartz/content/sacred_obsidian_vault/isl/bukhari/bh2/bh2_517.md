 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:516</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Wail:</i></p>
 Hudhaifa said, "'Umar said, 'Who amongst you remembers the statement 
 of Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) about afflictions'?' I said, 'I know it 
 as the Prophet had said it.' 'Umar said, 'No doubt, you are bold. How 
 did he say it?' I said, 'A man's afflictions (wrong deeds) concerning 
 his wife, children and neighbors are expiated by (his) prayers, 
 charity, and enjoining good.' (The sub-narrator Sulaiman added that he
 said, 'The prayer, charity, enjoining good and forbidding evil.') 
 'Umar said, 'I did not mean that, but I ask about that affliction 
 which will spread like the waves of the sea.' I said, 'O chief of the 
 believers! You need not be afraid of it as there is a closed door 
 between you and it.' He asked, 'Will the door be broken or opened?' I 
 replied, 'No, it will be broken.' He said, 'Then, if it is broken, it 
 will never be closed again?' I replied, 'Yes.' " Then we were afraid 
 to ask what that door was, so we asked Masruq to inquire, and he asked
 Hudhaifa regarding it. Hudhaifa said, "The door was 'Umar. "We further
 asked Hudhaifa whether 'Umar knew what that door meant. Hudhaifa 
 replied in the affirmative and added, "He knew it as one knows that 
 there will be a night before the tomorrow morning."
