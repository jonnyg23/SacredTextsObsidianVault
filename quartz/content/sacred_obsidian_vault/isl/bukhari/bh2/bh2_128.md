 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:129</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas:</i></p>
 A man came to the Prophet (p.b.u.h) and said, "Livestock are destroyed
 and the roads are cut off." So Allah's Apostle invoked Allah for rain 
 and it rained from that Friday till the next Friday. The same person 
 came again and said, "Houses have collapsed, roads are cut off, and 
 the livestock are destroyed. Please pray to Allah to withhold the 
 rain." Allah's Apostle (stood up and) said, "O Allah! (Let it rain) on
 the plateaus, on the hills, in the valleys and over the places where 
 trees grow." So the clouds cleared away from Medina as clothes are 
 taken off .
