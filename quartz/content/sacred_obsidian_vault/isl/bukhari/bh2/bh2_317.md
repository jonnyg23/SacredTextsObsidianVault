 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:315</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdullah bin Buhaina :</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle once led us in a prayer and offered two Rakat and got 
 up (for the third Raka) without sitting (after the second Raka). The 
 people also got up with him, and when he was about to finish his 
 prayer, we waited for him to finish the prayer with Taslim but he said
 Takbir before Taslim and performed two prostrations while sitting and 
 then finished the prayer with Taslim.
