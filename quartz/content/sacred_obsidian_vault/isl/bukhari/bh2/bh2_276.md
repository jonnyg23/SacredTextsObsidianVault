 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:275</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn 'Umar:</i></p>
 I remember ten Rakat of Nawafil from the Prophet, two Rakat before the
 Zuhr prayer and two after it; two Rakat after Maghrib prayer in his 
 house, and two Rakat after 'Isha' prayer in his

 would enter the house of the Prophet Hafsa told me that the Prophet 
 used to offer two Rakat after the call maker had made the Adhan and 
 the day had dawned.
