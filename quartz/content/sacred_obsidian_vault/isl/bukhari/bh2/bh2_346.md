 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:345</h3><p><i>Narrated Um 'Atiyya</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle came to us and we were giving a bath to his (dead) 
 daughter and said, "Wash her three, five or more times with water and 
 Sidr and sprinkle camphor on her at the end; and when you finish, 
 notify me." So when we finished, we informed him and he gave us his 
 waist-sheet and told us to shroud her in it. Aiyub said that Hafsa 
 narrated to him a narration similar to that of Muhammad in which it 
 was said that the bath was to be given for an odd number of times, and
 the numbers 3, 5 or 7 were mentioned. It was also said that they were 
 to start with the right side and with the parts which were washed in 
 ablution, and that Um 'Atiyya also mentioned, "We combed her hair and 
 divided them in three braids."
