 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:349</h3><p><i>Narrated Muhammad:</i></p>
 Um 'Atiyya said, "One of the daughters of the Prophet died and he came
 out and said, 'Wash her three or five times or more, if you think it 
 necessary, with water and Sidr, and last of all put camphor (or some 
 camphor) and when you finish, inform me.' " Um Atiyya added, "When we 
 finished we informed him and he gave us his waist-sheet and said, 
 'Shroud her in it.' " And Um 'Atiyya (in another narration) added, 
 "The Prophet said, 'Wash her three, five or seven times or more, if 
 you think it necessary.' " Hafsa said that Um 'Atiyya had also said, 
 "We entwined her hair into three braids."
