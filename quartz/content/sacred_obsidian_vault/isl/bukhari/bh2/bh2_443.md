 went to him and found Abu Jahl bin Hisham and 'Abdullah bin Abi Umaiya
 bin Al-Mughira by his side. Allah's Apostle said to Abu Talib, "O 
 uncle! Say: None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, a sentence 
 with which I shall be a witness (i.e. argue) for you before Allah. Abu
 Jahl and 'Abdullah bin Abi Umaiya said, "O Abu Talib! Are you going to
 denounce the religion of Abdul Muttalib?" Allah's Apostle kept on 
 inviting Abu Talib to say it (i.e. 'None has the right to be 
 worshipped but Allah') while they (Abu Jahl and Abdullah) kept on 
 repeating their statement till Abu Talib said as his last statement 
 that he was on the religion of Abdul Muttalib and refused to say, 
 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah.' (Then Allah's Apostle
 said, "I will keep on asking Allah's forgiveness for you unless I am 
 forbidden (by Allah) to do so." So Allah revealed (the verse)

 believe that they should invoke (Allah) for forgiveness for pagans 
 even though they be of kin, after it has become clear to them that 
 they are companions of the fire (9.113).
