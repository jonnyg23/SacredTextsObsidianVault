 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:141</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas bin Malik</i></p>
 The Prophet never raised his hands for any invocation except for that 
 of Istisqa' and he used to raise them so much that the whiteness of 
 his armpits became visible. (Note: It may be that Anas  did not see 
 the Prophet  raising his hands, but it is narrated that the Prophet 
 used to raise his hands for invocations other than Istisqa. See 
 Hadith No. 807 &amp; 808 and also see Hadith No. 612, Vol. 5).
