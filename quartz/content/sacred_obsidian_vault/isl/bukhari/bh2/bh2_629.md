 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:627</h3><p><i>Narrated Aisha:</i></p>
 (the wife of the Prophet (p.b.u.h)  We set out with the Prophet in his
 last Hajj and we assumed Ihram for Umra. The Prophet then said, 
 "Whoever has the Hadi with him should assume Ihram for Hajj along with
 'Umra and should not finish the Ihram till he finishes both." I was 
 menstruating when I reached Mecca, and so I neither did Tawaf round 
 the Ka'ba nor Tawaf between Safa and Marwa. I complained about that to
 the Prophet on which he replied, "Undo and comb your head hair, and 
 assume Ihram for Hajj (only) and leave the Umra." So, I did so. When 
 we had performed the Hajj, the Prophet sent me with my brother 
 'Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr to Tan'im. So I performed the 'Umra. The 
 Prophet said to me, "This 'Umra is instead of your missed one." Those 
 who had assumed Ihram for 'Umra (Hajj-atTamattu) performed Tawaf round
 the Ka'ba and between Safa and Marwa and then finished their Ihram. 
 After returning from Mina, they performed another Tawaf (between Safa 
 and Marwa). Those who had assumed Ihram for Hajj and 'Umra together 
 (Hajj-al-Qiran) performed only one Tawaf (between Safa and Marwa).
