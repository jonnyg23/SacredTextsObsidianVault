 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:503</h3><p><i>Narrated Ma'n bin Yazid:</i></p>
 My grandfather, my father and I gave the pledge of allegiance to 
 Allah's Apostle. The Prophet got me engaged and then got me married. 
 One day I went to the Prophet with a complaint. My father Yazid had 
 taken some gold coins for charity and kept them with a man in the 
 mosque (to give them to the poor) But I went and took them and brought
 them to him (my father). My father said, "By Allah! I did not intend 
 to give them to you. " I took (the case) to Allah's Apostle . On that 
 Allah's Apostle said, "O Yazid! You will be rewarded for what you 
 intended. O Man! Whatever you have taken is yours."
