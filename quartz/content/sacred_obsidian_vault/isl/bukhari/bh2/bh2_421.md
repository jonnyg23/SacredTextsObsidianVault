 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:420</h3><p><i>Narrated Sulaiman Ash-Shaibani:</i></p>
 I heard Ash-Sha'bi saying, "I was told by a man who had passed with 
 the Prophet (p.b.u.h) by a grave that was separate from the other 
 graves that he (the Prophet ) led them in the prayer and they prayed 
 behind him." I said, "O Abu 'Amr! Who narrated that to you?" He 
 replied, "Ibn Abbas."
