 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:250</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 At the time of the Fajr prayer the Prophet asked Bilal, "Tell me of 
 the best deed you did after embracing Islam, for I heard your

 anything worth mentioning except that whenever I performed ablution 
 during the day or night, I prayed after that ablution as much as was 
 written for me."
