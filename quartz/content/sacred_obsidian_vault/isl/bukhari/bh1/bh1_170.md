 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:170</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</i></p>
 saw Allah's Apostle when the 'Asr prayer was due and the people 
 searched for water to perform ablution but they could not find it. 
 Later on (a pot full of) water for ablution was brought to Allah's 
 Apostle . He put his hand in that pot and ordered the people to 
 perform ablution from it. I saw the water springing out from 
 underneath his fingers till all of them performed the ablution (it was
 one of the miracles of the Prophet).
