 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:463</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Waqid al-Laithi:</i></p>
 While Allah's Apostle was sitting in the mosque (with some people) 
 three men came, two of them came in front of Allah's Apostle and the 
 third one went away, and then one of them found a place in the circle 
 and sat there while the second man sat behind the gathering, and the 
 third one went away. When Allah's Apostle finished his preaching, he 
 said, "Shall I tell you about these three persons? One of them betook 
 himself to Allah and so Allah accepted him and accommodated him; the 
 second felt shy before Allah so Allah did the same for him and 
 sheltered him in His Mercy (and did not punish him), while the third 
 turned his face from Allah, and went away, so Allah turned His face 
 from him likewise.
