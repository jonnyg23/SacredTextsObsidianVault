 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:360</h3><p><i>Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:</i></p>
 While Allah's Apostle was carrying stones (along) with the people of 
 Mecca for (the building of) the Ka'ba wearing an Izar (waist-sheet 
 cover), his uncle Al-'Abbas said to him, "O my nephew! (It would be 
 better) if you take off your Izar and put it over your shoulders 
 underneath the stones." So he took off his Izar and put it over his 
 shoulders, but he fell unconscious and since then he had never been 
 seen naked.
