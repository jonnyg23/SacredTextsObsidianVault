 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:259</h3><p><i>Narrated Maimuna:</i></p>
 I placed water for the bath of the Prophet and he poured water with 
 his right hand on his left and washed them. Then he washed his private
 parts and rubbed his hands on the ground, washed them with water, 
 rinsed his mouth and washed his nose by putting water in it and 
 blowing it out, washed his face and poured water on his head. He 
 withdrew from that place and washed his feet. A piece of cloth (towel)
 was given to him but he did not use it.
