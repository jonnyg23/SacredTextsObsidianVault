 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:132</h3><p><i>Narrated Um Salama:</i></p>
 Um-Sulaim came to Allah's Apostle and said, "Verily, Allah is not shy 
 of (telling you) the truth. Is it necessary for a woman to take a bath
 after she has a wet dream (nocturnal sexual discharge?) The Prophet 
 replied, "Yes, if she notices a discharge." Um Salama, then covered 
 her face and asked, "O Allah's Apostle! Does a woman get a discharge?"
 He replied, "Yes, let your right hand be in dust (An Arabic expression
 you say to a person when you contradict his statement meaning "you 
 will not achieve goodness"), and that is why the son resembles his 
 mother."
