 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:100</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Amr bin Al' As:</i></p>
 I heard Allah's Apostle saying, "Allah does not take away the 
 knowledge, by taking it away from (the hearts of) the people, but 
 takes it away by the death of the religious learned men till when none
 of the (religious learned men) remains, people will take as their 
 leaders ignorant persons who when consulted will give their verdict 
 without knowledge. So they will go astray and will lead the people 
 astray."
