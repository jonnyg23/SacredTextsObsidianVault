 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:582</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle said, "When the Adhan is pronounced Satan takes to his
 heels and passes wind with noise during his flight in order not to 
 hear the Adhan. When the Adhan is completed he comes back and again 
 takes to his heels when the Iqama is pronounced and after its 
 completion he returns again till he whispers into the heart of the 
 person (to divert his attention from his prayer) and makes him 
 remember things which he does not recall to his mind before the prayer
 and that causes him to forget how much he has prayed."
