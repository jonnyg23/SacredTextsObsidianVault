 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:795</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Aisha:</i></p>
 (the wife of the Prophet) Allah's Apostle used to invoke Allah in the 
 prayer saying "Allahumma inni a'udhu bika min adhabil-qabri, wa a'udhu
 bika min fitnatil-masihid-dajjal, wa a'udhu bika min fitnatil-mahya wa
 fitnatil-mamati. Allahumma inni a'udhu bika minal-ma thami 
 wal-maghrami. (O Allah, I seek refuge with You from the punishment of 
 the grave and from the afflictions of Masi,h Ad-Dajjal and from the 
 afflictions of life and death. O Allah, I seek refuge with You from 
 the sins and from being in debt)." Somebody said to him, "Why do you 
 so frequently seek refuge with Allah from being in debt?" The Prophet 
 replied, "A person in debt tells lies whenever he speaks, and breaks 
 promises whenever he makes (them)." 'Aisha also narrated: I heard 
 Allah's Apostle in his prayer seeking refuge with Allah from the 
 afflictions of Ad-dajjal.
