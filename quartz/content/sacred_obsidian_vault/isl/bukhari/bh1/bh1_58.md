 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:59</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn 'Umar:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "Amongst the trees, there is a tree, the leaves of 
 which do not fall and is like a Muslim. Tell me the name of that 
 tree." Everybody started thinking about the trees of the desert areas.
 And I thought of the date-palm tree. The others then asked, "Please 
 inform us what is that tree, O Allah's Apostle?" He replied, "It is 
 the date-palm tree."
