 Whenever Ibn 'Umar started the prayer with Takbir, he used to raise 
 his hands: whenever he bowed, he used to raise his hands (before 
 bowing) and also used to raise his hands on saying, "Sami a-l-lahu 
 Liman hamida", and he used to do the same on rising from the second 
 Rak'a (for the 3rd Rak'a). Ibn 'Umar said: "The Prophet used to do the
 same."
