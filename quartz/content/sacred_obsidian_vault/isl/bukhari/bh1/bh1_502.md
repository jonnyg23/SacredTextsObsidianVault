 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:500</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn Shihab:</i></p>
 Once'Umar bin 'Abdul 'Aziz delayed the prayer and 'Urwa bin Az-Zubair 
 went to him and said, "Once in 'Iraq, Al-MughTra bin Shu'ba delayed 
 his prayers and Abi Mas'ud Al-Ansari went to him and said, 'O Mughira!
 What is this? Don't you know that once Gabriel came and offered the 
 prayer (Fajr prayer) and Allah's Apostle prayed too, then he prayed 
 again (Zuhr prayer) and so did Allah's Apostle and again he prayed 
 ('Asr prayers and Allah's Apostle did the same; again he prayed 
 (Maghrib-prayer) and so did Allah's Apostle and again prayed ('Isha 
 prayer) and so did Allah's Apostle and (Gabriel) said, 'I was ordered 
 to do so (to demonstrate the prayers prescribed to you)?'" 'Umar (bin 
 'Abdul 'AzTz) said to 'Urwa, "Be sure of what you Say. Did Gabriel 
 lead Allah's Apostle at the stated times of the prayers?" 'Urwa 
 replied, "Bashir bin Abi Mas'ud narrated like this on the authority of
 his father." Urwa added, "Aisha told me that Allah's Apostle used to 
 pray 'Asr prayer when the sun-shine was still inside her residence 
 (during the early time of 'Asr)."
