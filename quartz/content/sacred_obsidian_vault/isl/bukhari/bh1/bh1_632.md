 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:630</h3><p><i>Narrated Humaid:</i></p>
 Anas was asked, "Did Allah's Apostle wear a ring?" He said, "Yes. Once
 he delayed the 'Isha' prayer till mid-night and after the prayer, he 
 faced us and said, 'The people prayed and have slept and you remained 
 in prayer as long as you waited for it.' " Anas added, "As if I were 
 just now observing the glitter of his ring."
