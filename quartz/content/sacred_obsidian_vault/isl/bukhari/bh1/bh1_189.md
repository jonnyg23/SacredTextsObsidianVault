 of my sister has got a disease in his legs." So he passed his hands on
 my head and prayed for Allah's blessings for me; then he performed 
 ablution and I drank from the remaining water. I stood behind him and 
 saw the seal of Prophethood between his shoulders, and it was like the
 "Zir-al-Hijla" (means the button of a small tent, but some said 'egg 
 of a partridge.' etc.)
