 The Prophet forbade two kinds of sales i.e. Al-Limais and An-Nibadh 
 (the former is a kind of sale in which the deal is completed if the 
 buyer touches a thing, without seeing or checking it properly and the 
 latter is a kind of a sale in which the deal is completed when the 
 seller throws a thing towards the buyer giving him no opportunity to 
 see, touch or check it) and (the Prophet forbade) also 
 Ishtimal-As-Samma' and Al-Ihtiba' in a single garment.
