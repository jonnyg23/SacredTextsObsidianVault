 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:456</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:</i></p>
 "Allah's Apostle in his fatal illness came out with a piece of cloth 
 tied round his head and sat on the pulpit. After thanking and praising
 Allah he said, "There is no one who had done more favor to me with

 Khalil, I would certainly have taken Abu- Bakr but the Islamic 
 brotherhood is superior. Close all the small doors in this mosque 
 except that of Abu Bakr."
