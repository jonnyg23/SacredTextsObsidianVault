 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:532</h3><p><i>Narrated Salim bin 'Abdullah:</i></p>
 My father said, "I heard Allah's Apostle saying, 'The period of your 
 stay as compared to the previous nations is like the period equal to 
 the time between the 'Asr prayer and sunset. The people of the Torah 
 were given the Torah and they acted (upon it) till mid-day then they 
 were exhausted and were given one Qirat (of gold) each. And then the 
 people of the Gospel were given the Gospel and they acted (upon it) 
 till the 'Asr prayer then they were exhausted and were! given one 
 Qirat each. And then we were given the Qur'an and we acted (upon it) 
 till sunset and we were given two Qirats each. On that the people of 
 both the scriptures said, 'O our Lord! You have given them two Qirats 
 and given us one Qirat, though we have worked more than they.' Allah 
 said, 'Have I usurped some of your right?' They said, 'No.' Allah 
 said: "That is my blessing I bestow upon whomsoever I wish."
