 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:689</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "The Imam is (appointed) to be followed. So do not 
 differ from him, bow when he bows, and say, "Rabbana-lakal hamd" if he
 says "Sami'a-l-lahu Liman hamida"; and if he prostrates, prostrate 
 (after him), and if he prays sitting, pray sitting all together, and 
 straighten the rows for the prayer, as the straightening of the rows 
 is amongst those things which make your prayer a correct and perfect 
 one. (See Hadith No. 657).
