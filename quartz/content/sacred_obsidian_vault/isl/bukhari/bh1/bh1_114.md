 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:114</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Ubaidullah bin 'Abdullah:</i></p>
 Ibn 'Abbas said, "When the ailment of the Prophet became worse, he 
 said, 'Bring for me (writing) paper and I will write for you a 
 statement after which you will not go astray.' But 'Umar said, 'The 
 Prophet is seriously ill, and we have got Allah's Book with us and 
 that is sufficient for us.' But the companions of the Prophet differed
 about this and there was a hue and cry. On that the Prophet said to 
 them, 'Go away (and leave me alone). It is not right that you should 
 quarrel in front of me." Ibn 'Abbas came out saying, "It was most 
 unfortunate (a great disaster) that Allah's Apostle was prevented from
 writing that statement for them because of their disagreement and 
 noise. (Note: It is apparent from this Hadith that Ibn 'Abbes had 
 witnessed the event and came out saying this statement. The truth is 
 not so, for Ibn 'Abbas used to say this statement on narrating the 
 Hadith and he had not witnessed the event personally. See Fath Al-Bari
 Vol. 1, p.220 footnote.) (See Hadith No. 228, Vol. 4).
