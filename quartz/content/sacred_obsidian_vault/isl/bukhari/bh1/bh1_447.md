 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:446</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Aisha:</i></p>
 Barira came to seek my help regarding her manumission. I told herself 
 you like I would pay your price to your masters but your Al-Wala(1) 
 would be for me." Her masters said, "If you like, you can pay what 
 remains (of the price of her manumission), (Sufyan the sub-narrator 
 once said), or if you like you can manumit her, but her (inheritance) 
 Al-Wala would be for us. "When Allah's Apostle came, I spoke to him 
 about it. He said, "Buy her and manumit her. No doubt Al-Wala(1) is 
 for the manumitted." Then Allah's Apostle stood on the pulpit (or 
 Allah's Apostle ascended the pulpit as Sufyan once said), and said, 
 "What about some people who impose conditions which are not present in
 Allah's Book (Laws)? Whoever imposes conditions which are not in 
 Allah's Book (Laws), his conditions will be invalid even if he imposed
 them a hundred times."
