 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:55</h3><p><i>Narrated Ziyad bin'Ilaqa:</i></p>
 I heard Jarir bin 'Abdullah (Praising Allah). On the day when 
 Al-Mughira bin Shu'ba died, he (Jarir) got up (on the pulpit) and 
 thanked and praised Allah and said, "Be afraid of Allah alone Who has 
 none along with Him to be worshipped.(You should) be calm and quiet 
 till the (new) chief comes to you and he will come to you soon. Ask 
 Allah's forgiveness for your (late) chief because he himself loved to 
 forgive others." Jarir added, "Amma badu (now then), I went to the 
 Prophet and said, 'I give my pledge of allegiance to you for Islam." 
 The Prophet conditioned (my pledge) for me to be sincere and true to 
 every Muslim so I gave my pledge to him for this. By the Lord of this 
 mosque! I am sincere and true to you (Muslims). Then Jarir asked for 
 Allah's forgiveness and came down (from the pulpit).
