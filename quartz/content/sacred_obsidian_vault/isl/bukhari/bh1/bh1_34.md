 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:35</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "The person who participates in (Holy battles) in 
 Allah's cause and nothing compels him to do so except belief in Allah 
 and His Apostles, will be recompensed by Allah either with a reward, 
 or booty (if he survives) or will be admitted to Paradise (if he is 
 killed in the battle as a martyr). Had I not found it difficult for my
 followers, then I would not remain behind any sariya going for Jihad 
 and I would have loved to be martyred in Allah's cause and then made 
 alive, and then martyred and then made alive, and then again martyred 
 in His cause."
