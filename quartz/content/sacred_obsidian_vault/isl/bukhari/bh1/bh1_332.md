 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:332</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Urwa's father:</i></p>
 Aisha said, "I borrowed a necklace from Asma' and it was lost. So 
 Allah's Apostle sent a man to search for it and he found it. Then the 
 time of the prayer became due and there was no water. They prayed 
 (without ablution) and informed Allah's Apostle about it, so the verse
 of Tayammum was revealed." Usaid bin Hudair said to 'Aisha, "May Allah
 reward you. By Allah, whenever anything happened which you did not 
 like, Allah brought good for you and for the Muslims in that."
 <p>
 Al-Jurf and the time for the 'Asr prayer became due while he was at 
 Marbad-AnNa'am (sheep-fold), so he (performed Tayammum) and prayed 
 there and then entered Medina when the sun was still high but he did 
 not repeat that prayer.
