 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:72</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn 'Umar:</i></p>
 We were with the Prophet and a spadix of date-palm tree was brought to
 him. On that he said, "Amongst the trees, there is a tree which 
 resembles a Muslim." I wanted to say that it was the date-palm tree 
 but as I was the youngest of all (of them) I kept quiet. And then the 
 Prophet said, "It is the date-palm tree."
