 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:17</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Ubada bin As-Samit:</i></p>
 who took part in the battle of Badr and was a Naqib (a person heading 
 a group of six persons), on the night of Al-'Aqaba pledge: Allah's 
 Apostle said while a group of his companions were around him, "Swear 
 allegiance to me for:
 <p>
 1. Not to join anything in worship along with Allah.
 </p><p>
 2. Not to steal.
 </p><p>
 3. Not to commit illegal sexual intercourse.
 </p><p>
 4. Not to kill your children.
 </p><p>
 5. Not to accuse an innocent person (to spread such an accusation 
 among people).
 </p><p>
 6. Not to be disobedient (when ordered) to do good deed."
 </p><p>
 The Prophet added: "Whoever among you fulfills his pledge will be 
 rewarded by Allah. And whoever indulges in any one of them (except the
 ascription of partners to Allah) and gets the punishment in this 
 world, that punishment will be an expiation for that sin. And if one 
 indulges in any of them, and Allah conceals his sin, it is up to Him 
 to forgive or punish him (in the Hereafter)." 'Ubada bin As-Samit 
 added: "So we swore allegiance for these." (points to Allah's 
 Apostle)
