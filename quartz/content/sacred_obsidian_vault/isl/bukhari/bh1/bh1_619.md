 Allah's Apostle said, "By Him in Whose Hand my soul is I was about to 
 order for collecting fire-wood (fuel) and then order Someone to 
 pronounce the Adhan for the prayer and then order someone to lead the 
 prayer then I would go from behind and burn the houses of men who did 
 not present themselves for the (compulsory congregational) prayer. By 
 Him, in Whose Hands my soul is, if anyone of them had known that he 
 would get a bone covered with good meat or two (small) pieces of meat 
 present in between two ribs, he would have turned up for the 'Isha' 
 prayer.'
