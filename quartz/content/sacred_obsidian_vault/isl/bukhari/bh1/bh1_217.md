 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:217</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:</i></p>
 The Prophet once passed by two graves and said, "These two persons are
 being tortured not for a major sin (to avoid). One of them never saved
 himself from being soiled with his urine, while the other used to go 
 about with calumnies(to make enmity between friends)." The Prophet 
 then took a green leaf of a date-palm tree, split it into (pieces) and
 fixed one on each grave. They said, "O Allah's Apostle! Why have you 
 done so?" He replied, "I hope that their punishment might be lessened 
 till these (the pieces of the leaf) become dry." (See the foot-note of
 Hadith 215).
