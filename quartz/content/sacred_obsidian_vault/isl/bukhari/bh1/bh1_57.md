 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:58</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn 'Umar:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle said, "Amongst the trees, there is a tree, the leaves 
 of which do not fall and is like a Muslim. Tell me the name of that 
 tree." Everybody started thinking about the trees of the desert areas.
 And I thought of the date-palm tree but felt shy to answer the others 
 then asked, "What is that tree, O Allah's Apostle ?" He replied, "It 
 is the date-palm true."
