 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:767</h3><p><i>Narrated Aiyub:</i></p>
 Abu Qilaba said, "Malik bin Huwairith used to demonstrate to us the 
 prayer of the Prophet at times other than that of the compulsory 
 prayers. So (once) he stood up for prayer and performed a perfect 
 Qiyam (standing and reciting from the Holy Qur'an) and then bowed and 
 performed bowing perfectly; then he raised his head and stood straight
 for a while." Abu Qilaba added, "Malik bin Huwairith in that 
 demonstration prayed like this Sheikh of ours, Abu Yazid." Abu, Yazid 
 used to sit (for a while) on raising his head from the second 
 prostration before getting up.
