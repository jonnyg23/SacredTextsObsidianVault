 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:369</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Aisha:</i></p>
 the Prophet prayed in a Khamisa (a square garment) having marks. 
 During the prayer, he looked at its marks. So when he finished the 
 prayer he said, "Take this Khamisa of mine to Abu Jahm and get me his 
 Inbijaniya (a woolen garment without marks) as it (the Khamisa) has 
 diverted my attention from the prayer."
