 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:179</h3><p><i>Narrated Zaid bin Khalid:</i></p>
 I asked 'Uthman bin 'Affan about a person who engaged in intercourse 
 but did no discharge. 'Uthman replied, "He should perform ablution 
 like the one for ar ordinary prayer but he must wash his penis." 
 'Uthman added, "I heard it from Allah's Apostle." I asked 'Ali 
 Az-Zubair, Talha and Ubai bin Ka'b about it and they, too, gave the 
 same reply. (This order was cancelled later on and taking a bath 
 became necessary for such cases).
