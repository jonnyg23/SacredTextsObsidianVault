 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:447</h3><p><i>Narrated Ka'b:</i></p>
 In the mosque l asked Ibn Abi Hadrad to pay the debts which he owed to
 me and our voices grew louder. Allah's Apostle heard that while he was
 in his house. So he came to us raising the curtain of his room and 
 said, "O Ka'b!" I replied, "Labaik, O Allah's Apostle!" He said, "O 
 Ka'b! reduce your debt to one half," gesturing with his hand. I said, 
 "O Allah's Apostle! I have done so." Then Allah's Apostle said (to Ibn
 Abi Hadrad), "Get up and pay the debt to him."
