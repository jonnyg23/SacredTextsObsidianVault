 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:28</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:</i></p>
 The Prophet said: "I was shown the Hell-fire and that the majority of 
 its dwellers were women who were ungrateful." It was asked, "Do they 
 disbelieve in Allah?" (or are they ungrateful to Allah?) He replied, 
 "They are ungrateful to their husbands and are ungrateful for the 
 favors and the good (charitable deeds) done to them. If you have 
 always been good (benevolent) to one of them and then she sees 
 something in you (not of her liking), she will say, 'I have never 
 received any good from you."
