 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:809</h3><p><i>Narrated Um Salama:</i></p>
 "The Prophet after finishing the prayer with Taslim used to stay at 
 his place for a while." Ibn Shihab said, "I think (and Allah knows 
 better), that he used to wait for the departure of the women who had 
 prayed." Ibn Shihab wrote that he had heard it from Hind bint 
 Al-Harith Al-Firasiya from Um Salama, the wife of the Prophet (Hind 
 was from the companions of Um Salama) who said, "When the Prophet 
 finished the prayer with Taslim, the women would depart and enter 
 their houses before Allah's Apostle departed."
