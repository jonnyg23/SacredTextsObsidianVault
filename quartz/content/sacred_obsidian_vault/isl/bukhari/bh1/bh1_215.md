 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:215</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:</i></p>
 Once the Prophet, while passing through one of the grave-yards of 
 Medina or Mecca heard the voices of two persons who were being 
 tortured in their graves. The Prophet said, "These two persons are 
 being tortured not for a major sin (to avoid)." The Prophet then 
 added, "Yes! (they are being tortured for a major sin). Indeed, one of
 them never saved himself from being soiled with his urine while the 
 other used to go about with calumnies (to make enmiy between friends).
 The Prophet then asked for a green leaf of a date-palm tree, broke it 
 into two pieces and put one on each grave. On being asked why he had 
 done so, he replied, "I hope that their torture might be lessened, 
 till these get dried."
