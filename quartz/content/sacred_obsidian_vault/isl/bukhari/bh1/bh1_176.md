 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:176</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle said, "A person is considered in prayer as long as he 
 is waiting for the prayer in the mosque as long as he does not do 
 Hadath." A non-Arab man asked, "O Abii Huraira! What is Hadath?" I 
 replied, "It is the passing of wind (from the anus) (that is one of 
 the types of Hadath)."
