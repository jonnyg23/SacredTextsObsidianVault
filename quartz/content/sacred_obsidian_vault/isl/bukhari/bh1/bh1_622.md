 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:620</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle said, "The reward of the prayer offered by a person in
 congregation is twenty five times greater than that of the prayer 
 offered in one's house or in the market (alone). And this is because 
 if he performs ablution and does it perfectly and then proceeds to the
 mosque with the sole intention of praying, then for every step he 
 takes towards the mosque, he is upgraded one degree in reward and his 
 one sin is taken off (crossed out) from his accounts (of deeds). When 
 he offers his prayer, the angels keep on asking Allah's Blessings and 
 Allah's forgiveness for him as long as he is (staying) at his Musalla.
 They say, 'O Allah! Bestow Your blessings upon him, be Merciful and 
 kind to him.' And one is regarded in prayer as long as one is waiting 
 for the prayer."
