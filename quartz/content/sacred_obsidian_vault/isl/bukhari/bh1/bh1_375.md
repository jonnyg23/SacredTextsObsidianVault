 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:375</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</i></p>
 Once Allah's Apostle fell off a horse and his leg or shoulder got 
 injured. He swore that he would not go to his wives for one month and 
 he stayed in a Mashruba (attic room) having stairs made of date palm 
 trunks. So his companions came to visit him, and he led them in prayer
 sitting, whereas his companions were standing. When he finished the 
 prayer, he said, "Imam is meant to be followed, so when he says 
 'Allahu Akbar,' say 'Allahu Akbar' and when he bows, bow and when he 
 prostrates, prostrate and if he prays standing pray, standing. After 
 the 29th day the Prophet came down (from the attic room) and the 
 people asked him, "O Allah's Apostle! You swore that you will not go 
 to your wives for one month." He said, "The month is 29 days."
