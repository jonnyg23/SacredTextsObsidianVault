 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:688</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "Martyrs are those who die because of drowning, 
 plague, an abdominal disease, or of being buried alive by a falling

 the reward for the 'Isha' and the Fajr prayers in congregation, they 
 would join them even if they had to crawl. If they knew the reward for
 the first row, they would draw lots for it."
