 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:194</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas:</i></p>
 It was the time for prayer, and those whose houses were near got up 
 and went to their people (to perform ablution), and there remained 
 some people (sitting). Then a painted stove pot (Mikhdab) containing 
 water was brought to Allah's Apostles The pot was small, not broad 
 enough for one to spread one's hand in; yet all the people performed 
 ablution. (The sub narrator said, "We asked Anas, 'How many persons 
 were you?' Anas replied 'We were eighty or more"). (It was one of the 
 miracles of Allah's Apostle).
