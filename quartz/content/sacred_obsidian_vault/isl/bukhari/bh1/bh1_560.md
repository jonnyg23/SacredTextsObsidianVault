 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:558</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle forbade two kinds of sales, two kinds of dresses, and 
 two prayers. He forbade offering prayers after the Fajr prayer till 
 the rising of the sun and after the 'Asr prayer till its setting. He 
 also forbade "Ishtimal-Assama" and "al-Ihtiba" in one garment in such 
 a way that one's private parts are exposed towards the sky. He also 
 forbade the sales called "Munabadha" and "Mulamasa." (See 
 Hadith No. 354 and 355 Vol. 3).
