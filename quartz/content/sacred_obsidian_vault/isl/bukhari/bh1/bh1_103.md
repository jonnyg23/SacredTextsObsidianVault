 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:103</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn Abu Mulaika:</i></p>
 Whenever 'Aisha (the wife of the Prophet) heard anything which she did
 not understand, she used to ask again till she understood it 
 completely. Aisha said: "Once the Prophet said, "Whoever will be 
 called to account (about his deeds on the Day of Resurrection) will 
 surely be punished." I said, "Doesn't Allah say: "He surely will 
 receive an easy reckoning." (84.8) The Prophet replied, "This means 
 only the presentation of the accounts but whoever will be argued about
 his account, will certainly be ruined."
