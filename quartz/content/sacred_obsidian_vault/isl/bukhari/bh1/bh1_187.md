 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:187</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Juhaifa:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle came to us at noon and water for ablution was brought 
 to him. After he had performed ablution, the remaining water was taken
 by the people and they started smearing their bodies with it (as a 
 blessed thing). The Prophet offered two Rakat of the Zuhr prayer and 
 then two Rakat of the 'Asr prayer while an 'Anza (spear-headed stick) 
 was there (as a Sutra) in front of him. Abu Musa said: The Prophet 
 asked for a tumbler containing water and washed both his hands and 
 face in it and then threw a mouthful of water in the tumbler and said 
 to both of us (Abu Musa and Bilal), "Drink from the tumbler and pour 
 some of its water on your faces and chests."
