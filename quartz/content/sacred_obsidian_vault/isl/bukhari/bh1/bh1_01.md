 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:2</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Aisha:</i></p>
 (the mother of the faithful believers) Al-Harith bin Hisham asked 
 Allah's Apostle "O Allah's Apostle! How is the Divine Inspiration 
 revealed to you?" Allah's Apostle replied, "Sometimes it is (revealed)
 like the ringing of a bell, this form of Inspiration is the hardest of
 all and then this state passes ' off after I have grasped what is 
 inspired. Sometimes the Angel comes in the form of a man and talks to 
 me and I grasp whatever he says." 'Aisha added: Verily I saw the 
 Prophet being inspired Divinely on a very cold day and noticed the 
 Sweat dropping from his forehead (as the Inspiration was over).
