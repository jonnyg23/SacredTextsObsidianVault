 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:126</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Amar:</i></p>
 I saw the Prophet near the Jamra and the people were asking him 
 questions (about religious problems). A man asked, "O Allah's Apostle!
 I have slaughtered the Hadi (animal) before doing the Rami." The 
 Prophet replied, "Do the Rami (now) and there is no harm." Another 
 person asked, "O Allah's Apostle! I got my head shaved before 
 slaughtering the animal." The Prophet replied, "Do the slaughtering 
 (now) and there is no harm." So on that day, when the Prophet was 
 asked about anything as regards the ceremonies of Hajj performed 
 before or after its due time his reply was, "Do it (now) and there is 
 no harm."
