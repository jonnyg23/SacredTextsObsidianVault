 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:158</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdullah:</i></p>
 The Prophet went out to answer the call of nature and asked me to 
 bring three stones. I found two stones and searched for the third but 
 could not find it. So took a dried piece of dung and brought it to 
 him. He took the two stones and threw away the dung and said, "This is
 a filthy thing."
