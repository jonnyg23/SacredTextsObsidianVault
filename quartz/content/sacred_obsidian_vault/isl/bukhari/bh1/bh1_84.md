 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:85</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "(Religious) knowledge will be taken away (by the 
 death of religious scholars) ignorance (in religion) and afflictions

 Allah's Apostle?" He replied by beckoning with his hand indicating 
 "killing." (Fateh-al-Bari Page 192, Vol. 1)
