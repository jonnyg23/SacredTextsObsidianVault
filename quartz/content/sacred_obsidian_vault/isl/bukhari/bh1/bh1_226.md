 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:226</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Wail:</i></p>
 Abu Musa Al-Ash'ari used to lay great stress on the question of 
 urination and he used to say, "If anyone from Bani Israel happened to 
 soil his clothes with urine, he used to cut that portion away." 
 Hearing that, Hudhaifa said to Abu Wail, "I wish he (Abu Musa) didn't 
 (lay great stress on that matter)." Hudhaifa added, "Allah's Apostle 
 went to the dumps of some people and urinated while standing."
