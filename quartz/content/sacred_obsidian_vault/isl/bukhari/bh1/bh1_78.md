 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:79</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Musa:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "The example of guidance and knowledge with which 
 Allah has sent me is like abundant rain falling on the earth, some of 
 which was fertile soil that absorbed rain water and brought forth 
 vegetation and grass in abundance. (And) another portion of it was 
 hard and held the rain water and Allah benefited the people with it 
 and they utilized it for drinking, making their animals drink from it 
 and for irrigation of the land for cultivation. (And) a portion of it 
 was barren which could neither hold the water nor bring forth 
 vegetation (then that land gave no benefits). The first is the example
 of the person who comprehends Allah's religion and gets benefit (from 
 the knowledge) which Allah has revealed through me (the Prophets and 
 learns and then teaches others. The last example is that of a person 
 who does not care for it and does not take Allah's guidance revealed 
 through me (He is like that barren land.)"
