 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:515</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle came out as the sun declined at mid-day and offered 
 the Zuhr prayer. He then stood on the pulpit and spoke about the Hour 
 (Day of Judgment) and said that in it there would be tremendous 
 things. He then said, "Whoever likes to ask me about anything he can 
 do so and I shall reply as long as I am at this place of mine. Most of
 the people wept and the Prophet said repeatedly, "Ask me." Abdullah 
 bin Hudhafa As-Sahmi stood up and said, "Who is my father?" The 
 Prophet said, "Your father is Hudhafa." The Prophet repeatedly said, 
 "Ask me." Then Umar knelt before him and said, "We are pleased with 
 Allah as our Lord, Islam as our religion, and Muhammad as our 
 Prophet." The Prophet then became quiet and said, "Paradise and 
 Hell-fire were displayed in front of me on this wall just now and I 
 have never seen a better thing (than the former) and a worse thing 
 (than the latter)."
