 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:133</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar:</i></p>
 Once Allah's Apostle said, "Amongst the trees there is a tree, the 
 leaves of which do not fall and is like a Muslim, tell me the name of 
 that tree." Everybody started thinking about the trees of the desert 
 areas and I thought of the date-palm tree but felt shy (to answer). 
 The others asked, "O Allah's Apostle! inform us of it." He replied, 
 "it is the date-palm tree." I told my father what had come to my mind 
 and on that he said, "Had you said it I would have preferred it to 
 such and such a thing that I might possess."
