 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:38</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "Religion is very easy and whoever overburdens 
 himself in his religion will not be able to continue in that way. So 
 you should not be extremists, but try to be near to perfection and 
 receive the good tidings that you will be rewarded; and gain strength 
 by worshipping in the mornings, the nights." (See Fath-ul-Bari, Page 
 102, Vol 1).
