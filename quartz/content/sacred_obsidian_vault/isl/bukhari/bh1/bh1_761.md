 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:759</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 Once the Prophet entered the mosque, a man came in, offered the prayer
 and greeted the Prophet. The Prophet returned his greeting and said to
 him, "Go back and pray again for you have not prayed." The man offered
 the prayer again, came back and greeted the Prophet. He said to him 
 thrice, "Go back and pray again for you have not prayed." The man 
 said, "By Him Who has sent you with the truth! I do not know a better 
 way of praying. Kindly teach Me how to pray." He said, "When you stand
 for the prayer, say Takbir and then recite from the Qur'an what you 
 know and then bow with calmness till you feel at ease, then rise from 
 bowing till you stand straight. Afterwards prostrate calmly till you 
 feel at ease and then raise (your head) and sit with Calmness till you
 feel at ease and then prostrate with calmness till you feel at ease in
 prostration and do the same in the whole of your prayer."
