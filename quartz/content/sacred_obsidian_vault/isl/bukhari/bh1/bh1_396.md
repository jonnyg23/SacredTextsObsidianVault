 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:395</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Umar (bin Al-Khattab):</i></p>
 My Lord agreed with me in three things:
 <p>
 1. I said,"O Allah's Apostle, I wish we took the station of Abraham as
 our praying place (for some of our prayers). So came the Divine 
 Inspiration: And take you (people) the station of Abraham as a place 
 of prayer (for some of your prayers e.g. two Rakat of Tawaf of 
 Ka'ba)". (2.125)
 </p><p>
 2. And as regards the (verse of) the veiling of the women, I said, 'O 
 Allah's Apostle! I wish you ordered your wives to cover themselves 
 from the men because good and bad ones talk to them.' So the verse of 
 the veiling of the women was revealed.
 </p><p>
 3. Once the wives of the Prophet made a united front against the 
 Prophet and I said to them, 'It may be if he (the Prophet) divorced 
 you, (all) that his Lord (Allah) will give him instead of you wives 
 better than you.' So this verse (the same as I had said) was 
 revealed." (66.5).
