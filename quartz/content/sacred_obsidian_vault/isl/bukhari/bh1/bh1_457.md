 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:455</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</i></p>
 The Prophet delivered a sermon and said, "Allah gave a choice to one 
 of (His) slaves either to choose this world or what is with Him in the
 Hereafter. He chose the latter." Abu Bakr wept. I said lo myself, "Why
 is this Sheikh weeping, if Allah gave choice to one (of His) slaves 
 either to choose this world or what is with Him in the Here after and 
 he chose the latter?" And that slave was Allah's Apostle himself. Abu 
 Bakr knew more than us. The Prophet said, "O Abu Bakr! Don't weep. The
 Prophet added: Abu- Bakr has favored me much with his property and 
 company. If I were to take a Khalil from mankind I would certainly 
 have taken Abu Bakr but the Islamic brotherhood and friendship is 
 sufficient. Close all the gates in the mosque except that of Abu 
 Bakr.
