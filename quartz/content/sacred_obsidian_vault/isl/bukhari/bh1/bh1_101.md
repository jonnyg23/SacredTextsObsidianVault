 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:101</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</i></p>
 Some women requested the Prophet to fix a day for them as the men were
 taking all his time. On that he promised them one day for religious 
 lessons and commandments. Once during such a lesson the Prophet said, 
 "A woman whose three children die will be shielded by them from the 
 Hell fire." On that a woman asked, "If only two die?" He replied, 
 "Even two (will shield her from the Hell-fire)."
