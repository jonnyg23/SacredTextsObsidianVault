 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:180</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khud:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle sent for a Ansari man who came with water dropping 
 from his head. The Prophet said, "Perhaps we have forced you to hurry 
 up, haven't we?" The Ansari replied, "Yes." Allah's Apostle further 
 said, "If you are forced to hurry up (during intercourse) or you do 
 not discharge then ablution is due on you (This order was cancelled 
 later on, i.e. one has to take a bath).
