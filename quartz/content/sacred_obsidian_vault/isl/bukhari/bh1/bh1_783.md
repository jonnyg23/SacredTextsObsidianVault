 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:781</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Aisha:</i></p>
 The Prophet used to say frequently in his bowing and prostrations 
 "Subhanaka-Allahumma Rabbana Wabihamdika, Allahumma Ighfir-li" (I

 Allah! Our Lord! All praises are for You. O Allah! Forgive me). In 
 this way he was acting on what was explained to him in the Holy 
 Qur'an.
