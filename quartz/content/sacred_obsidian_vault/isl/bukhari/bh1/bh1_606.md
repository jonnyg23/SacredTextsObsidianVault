 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:604</h3><p><i>Narrated Malik:</i></p>
 We came to the Prophet and stayed with him for twenty days and nights.
 We were all young and of about the same age. The Prophet was very kind
 and merciful. When he realized our longing for our families, he asked 
 about our homes and the people there and we told him. Then he asked us
 to go back to our families and stay with them and teach them (the 
 religion) and to order them to do good things. He also mentioned some 
 other things which I have (remembered or) forgotten. The Prophet then 
 added, "Pray as you have seen me praying and when it is the time for 
 the prayer one of you should pronounce the Adhan and the oldest of you
 should lead the prayer.
