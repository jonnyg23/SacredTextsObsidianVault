 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:373</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Juhaifa:</i></p>
 I saw Allah's Apostle in a red leather tent and I saw Bilal taking the
 remaining water with which the Prophet had performed ablution. I saw 
 the people taking the utilized water impatiently and whoever got some 
 of it rubbed it on his body and those who could not get any took the 
 moisture from the others' hands. Then I saw Bilal carrying an 'Anza (a
 spear-headed stick) which he planted in the ground. The Prophet came 
 out tucking up his red cloak, and led the people in prayer and offered
 two Rakat (facing the Ka'ba) taking 'Anza as a Sutra for his prayer. I
 saw the people and animals passing in front of him beyond the 'Anza.
