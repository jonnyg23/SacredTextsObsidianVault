 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:787</h3><p><i>Narrated Aiyub:</i></p>
 Abu Qilaba said, "Malik bin Huwairith came to us and led us in the 
 prayer in this mosque of ours and said, 'I lead you in prayer but I do
 not want to offer the prayer but just to show you how Allah's Apostle 
 performed his prayers." I asked Abu Qilaba, "How was the prayer of 
 Malik bin Huwairith?" He replied, "Like the prayer of this Sheikh of 
 ours-- i.e. 'Amr bin Salima." That Sheikh used to pronounce the Takbir
 perfectly and when he raised his head from the second prostration he 
 would sit for a while and then support himself on the ground and get 
 up.
