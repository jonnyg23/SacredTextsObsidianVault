 <p>(107)</p>  
 <p>His supplication in the middle of the night</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>O Allah! How many of my deeds invited Your wrath but due to tolerance</p>  
 <p>You have averted it. And how many crimes were there which You have</p>  
 <p>concealed and kept away. Even if my whole life is spent in Your</p>  
 <p>disobedience and evil deeds have increased in my accounts but I don't</p>  
 <p>have any expectations from anyone except You. O Allah when I think of</p>  
 <p>Your Mercy, my sins appear to be little, and when I think of Your wrath,</p>  
 <p>my sins appear to be huge. Oh! What would happen when I see those</p>  
 <p>sins in my account which I have forgotten and You will order "Seize him"</p>  
 <p>Oh! How unfortunate would be the one whom You have arrested,</p>  
 <p>neither would his friends save him, nor his family members would be of</p>  
 <p>any help. The whole group would pity when the orders of hell would be</p>  
 <p>given. Oh! That fire which will cook the liver, peel off the skin. Oh!</p>  
 <p>Those raging flames and their deep pits.</p>
