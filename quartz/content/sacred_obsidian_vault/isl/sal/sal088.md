 <p>(87)</p>  
 <p>His supplication while going to Yemen</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>O Allah! I put my attention on You because I do not have trust on</p>  
 <p>anyone else, nor any hope that someone will make my destination</p>  
 <p>nearer, nor any strength, which can be trusted. Nor any excuse which</p>  
 <p>can be used. Only seeking Your grace, facing Your grandeur and</p>  
 <p>seeking contentment by good ethics. And You are fully aware of all the</p>  
 <p>goodness or evil committed by me, because all those transactions,</p>  
 <p>which pertains to me, includes Your examination whatever is worth the</p>  
 <p>praise and Your Judgment is commendable. You destroy whatever You</p>  
 <p>wish and make whatever You wish and in Your control is on the source</p>  
 <p>of the book. O Allah avert from me all the calamities and misfortunes</p>  
 <p>away from me, cover me with the shade of Your mercy, grant me the</p>  
 <p>vastness of Your grace and the honour of Your forgiveness so where</p>  
 <p>You have delayed I should not prefer haste, and those things in which</p>  
 <p>You have hastened, I prefer delay and with this I pray that You protect</p>  
 <p>my family and all those who are near me in such a way that You have</p>  
 <p>protected a believer who is not present, protection from every sin,</p>  
 <p>covering of defects, forgiveness for every disobedience away from all</p>  
 <p>those things which causes Your displeasure and grant me the tawfeeq</p>  
 <p>to thank You and to have Your remembrance upon this and the best</p>  
 <p>worship and Your satisfaction on Your decree. O the Guardian of the</p>  
 <p>believers! Gather me, my children, my believing friends and those who</p>  
 <p>are under my care, consider them under Your control, such that it is not</p>  
 <p>overpowered by anyone and keep them under Your guarantee that no</p>  
 <p>one can precede, under Your protection which cannot break, under Your</p>  
 <p>curtain which never opens up, because he who comes under Your</p>  
 <p>control Your Protection and Your care, is safe and satisfied and Power</p>  
 <p>and strength is just for Allah the great and honoured.</p>
