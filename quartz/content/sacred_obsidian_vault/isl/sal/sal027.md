 <p>His Dua at the time of severe difficulties</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>O Allah! O the one to degrade every insolent tyrant! O the one to honour</p>  
 <p>the believers! You are my refuge when the paths tire me. My Lord You</p>  
 <p>have created me and have obliged me although You were needless of</p>  
 <p>my existence. And if Your Mercy had not been there I would have</p>  
 <p>perished. You have sent protection against the enemies and without</p>  
 <p>Your help I would have been in errors. O the one to send mercy from the</p>  
 <p>mines of Mercy. O the one to create blessings from the treasures of</p>  
 <p>blessings. O He, Who has made Honour exclusively for Himself, then</p>  
 <p>honoured His chosen ones, in front of Whom the whole creation stands</p>  
 <p>eyes cast down and heads bowed down. I have hopes from that Great</p>  
 <p>Lord. My Lord! I ask You by Your position which You have exhibited by</p>  
 <p>Your greatness and I ask You by Your Honour by which You are on</p>  
 <p>Your throne and have created the entire universe. Now the whole</p>  
 <p>creation is in Your presence heads bowed down send blessing on</p>  
 <p>Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny (seek Your desires after it).</p>
