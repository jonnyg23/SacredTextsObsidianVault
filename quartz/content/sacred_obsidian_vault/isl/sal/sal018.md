 <p>Dua recited in morning prayers at the time</p>  
 <p>of Dawn</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>O Allah! Although my sins are such that deserve severing of relations</p>  
 <p>but I don't desire to sever relations due to my sins, neither can I speak</p>  
 <p>anything about Your happiness nor can I take refuge due to my wants,</p>  
 <p>nor due to my weakness can I repent fully. I have come, so that You</p>  
 <p>overlook my drawbacks. Your mercy is my source. Bless Muhammad</p>  
 <p>(s.a.w.a.) and his progeny and bestow honour on me by Your</p>  
 <p>forgiveness. (Then recite 300 times "Al Afw").</p>
