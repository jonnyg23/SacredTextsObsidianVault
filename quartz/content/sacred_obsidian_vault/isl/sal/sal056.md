 <p>Another of his supplication in troubles</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>And how many bounties of Allah are</p>  
 <p>concealed.</p>  
 <p>Whose understanding is above the</p>  
 <p>Heavens and the earth.</p>  
 <p>And so many comforts have come after</p>  
 <p>the troubles.</p>  
 <p>By which the sorrow from the sorrowful</p>  
 <p>hearts problems.</p>  
 <p>So many things, which brings grief in the</p>  
 <p>morning but by evening it turns into joy.</p>  
 <p>If any time the situation troubles you, then</p>  
 <p>put your trust on the Lord, the One, the</p>  
 <p>Unique.</p>  
 <p>Take the help of the Prophet because all</p>  
 <p>the problems by his intercession become</p>  
 <p>easy.</p>  
 <p>Whenever big calamities befall you do not</p>  
 <p>become restless, as many of Allah's action</p>  
 <p>are concealed.</p>  
 <p>O Allah! My Lord always send blessings</p>  
 <p>on the Prophet of Mecca and the guide.</p>  
 <p>O Ali Murtaza one glance of mercy.</p>  
 <p>I have come to You afraid of my position.</p>  
 <p>O my master! Save me from the things,</p>  
 <p>which I am scared of.</p>  
 <p>O Ali! O Ali! O Ali.</p>
