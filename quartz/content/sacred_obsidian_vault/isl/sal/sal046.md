 <p>His supplication for fever as taught by the</p>  
 <p>Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.)</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>O Allah! Have mercy on my delicate skin and weak bones, save me from</p>  
 <p>the burning things. O mother of Muldam, if you believe in Allah do not</p>  
 <p>eat the flesh, do not drink the blood and do not show your strength on</p>  
 <p>the mouth and go to the one who ascribes a partner to Allah. I testify that</p>  
 <p>there is no lord except Allah and He is one without any partner and that</p>  
 <p>Muhammad (peace be upon him and his progeny) is His servant and His</p>  
 <p>Prophet.</p>
