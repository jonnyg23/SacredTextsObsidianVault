 <p>His supplication for victory over the</p>  
 <p>enemies</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>And there is no strength or Power except with Allah the great and high.</p>  
 <p>O Allah we worship You and from You only we seek help. O Allah! O</p>  
 <p>Merciful! O Compassionate! O the one! O the self-sufficient! O God of</p>  
 <p>Muhammad! (Peace of Allah be on him and his progeny). In Your</p>  
 <p>Domain feet are moving ahead and with the presence of heart, eyes are</p>  
 <p>awaiting, necks are stretched high, where desires are asked and hands</p>  
 <p>are lifted. O Allah! You judge between us and our nation with truth, as</p>  
 <p>You are the best of the judges. (Then repeat three times). There is no</p>  
 <p>god except Allah and Allah is great.</p>
