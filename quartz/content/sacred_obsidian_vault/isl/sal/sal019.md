 <p>Dua seeking Pardon</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>O Allah! I seek forgiveness of all those sins of which You have</p>  
 <p>knowledge of either it is of my good deeds or evil deeds, knowledge of</p>  
 <p>my whole life, or from first to last, knowingly or unknowingly or the</p>  
 <p>knowledge of my sins that I have committed erroneously whether little or</p>  
 <p>great, big or small, old and new, secret or open and those sins of which I</p>  
 <p>am guilty of. And I ask forgiveness of You and request You to bless</p>  
 <p>Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and the progeny of Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and</p>  
 <p>forgive all my excesses which I have done on Your creation and is in</p>  
 <p>Your knowledge because their rights are incumbent on me and I am</p>  
 <p>responsible of it. But You can forgive them as You desire. O the most</p>  
 <p>merciful of all the mercifuls!</p>
