 <p>His Supplication known as "Kalimaatil</p>  
 <p>Faraj"</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>There is no god except Allah, the forbearing, the Generous. There is no</p>  
 <p>god except Allah the Highest, the Magnificent. Glory be to Allah, the</p>  
 <p>Lord of the seven skies and Lord of the seven earths and of all that is in</p>  
 <p>them, and all that is between them, and all that is beneath them and You</p>  
 <p>are the Lord of the great throne. Peace of Allah be on all the</p>  
 <p>Messengers and Praise is for Allah, Lord of the Worlds.</p>
