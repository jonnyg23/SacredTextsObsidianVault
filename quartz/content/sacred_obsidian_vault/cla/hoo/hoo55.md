 <h3 align="CENTER">TO THE NYMPHS.</h3>
 <h6 align="CENTER">The FUMIGATION from AROMATICS.</h6>
 <p>NYMPHS, who from Ocean's stream derive your birth,<br>
 Who dwell in liquid caverns of the earth</p>
 <p><a name="page_182"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 182</font></a></p>
 <p>Nurses of Bacchus secret-coursing pow'r,<br>
 Who fruits sustain, and nourish ev'ry flow'r:<br>
 Earthly, rejoicing, who in meadows dwell, 5<br>
 And caves and dens, whose depths extend to hell:<br>
 Holy, oblique, who swiftly soar thro' air,<br>
 Fountains and dews, and mazy streams your care:<br>
 Seen and unseen, who joy with wand'rings wide<br>
 And gentle course, thro' flow'ry vales to glide; 10<br>
 With Pan exulting on the mountains height,<br>
 Loud-founding, mad, whom rocks and woods delight:<br>
 Nymphs od'rous, rob'd in white, whose streams exhale<br>
 The breeze refreshing, and the balmy gale;<br>
 With goats and pastures pleas'd, and beasts of prey, 15<br>
 Nurses of fruits, unconscious of decay:<br>
 In cold rejoicing, and to cattle kind,<br>
 Sportive thro' ocean wand'ring unconfin'd:<br>
 Nysian, fanatic Nymphs, whom oaks delight,<br>
 Lovers of Spring, Pæonian virgins bright. 20<br>
 With Bacchus, and with Ceres, hear my pray'r.<br>
 And to mankind abundant favour bear;<br>
 Propitious listen to your suppliants voice,<br>
 Come, and benignant in these rites rejoice;<br>
 Give plenteous Seasons, and sufficient wealth, 25<br>
 And pour; in lasting streams, continued Health.</p>
