 <h3 align="CENTER">BOOK XIV.</h3>
 <p>    O MEN, why do ye vainly think on things<br>
 Too lofty, as if ye immortal were?<br>
 And ye are ruling but a little time,<br>
 And over mortals all desire to reign,<br>
 5 Not understanding that God himself hates<br>
 The lust of rule, and most of all things hates<br>
 Insatiate kings fearful in wickedness,<br>
 And over them he stirs up what is dark;<br>
 Wherefore, instead of good works and just thoughts,<br>
 10 Ye all choose for your garments purple robes,<br>
 Desiring wretched fights and homicides<br>
 Them God imperishable who dwells in heaven<br>
 Shall make short-lived, destroy them utterly,<br>
 And overthrow one here, another there.<br>
 15    But when there shall a bull-destroyer come</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[1. This book is the most obscure and inexplicable of the entire collection. Its date and authorship are quite uncertain. After the opening lines against the lust of power (1-14) there appears to be an allusion to the closing part of the preceding book; but the writer goes on to designate a long succession of emperors and conquerors, giving the initial letter of most of the names, as in previous books, and otherwise describing them, yet so inconsistently with what we know of history as to leave it impossible to identify with any certainty the individuals and events intended. Ewald has attempted to identify most of these names with known characters of Roman and Byzantine history (<i>Abhandlung</i>, pp. 99-111), but the results of his study have commanded no following, In the following notes we insert for the benefit of the reader his more plausible conjectures, but with no conviction that they represent the persons intended by the author.</p>
 <p>15. <i>Bull-destroyer</i>.--That is, the lion mentioned in book xiii, 221, symbolizing Odenatus.]</p>
 </font><p align="CENTER">(1-12.)</p>
 <p>{p. 238}</p>
 <p>Trusting in his own might, thick-haired and grim,<br>
 And shall destroy all, he shall also tear<br>
 Shepherds in pieces, and no victory<br>
 Shall be theirs unless soon, with speed of feet<br>
 20 Pursuing eagerly through wooded glens,<br>
 Young dogs shall meet in conflict; for a dog<br>
 Pursued the lion which destroys the shepherds.<br>
     And then there shall be a lord confident<br>
 In his might, and named with four syllables,<br>
 25 And shown forth clearly from the number one;<br>
 But him shall brazen Ares quickly slay<br>
 Because of conflict with insatiate men.<br>
     Then shall two other princely men bear rule,<br>
 Both of the number forty; and with them<br>
 30 Shall great peace be in the world and to all<br>
 The people law and right; but them in turn<br>
 Shall men with gleaming helmet, needing gold<br>
 And silver, impiously put to death<br>
 For these things, catching them by their deft plans.<br>
 35    And then again a dreadful lord shall rule,<br>
 Young, fighting hand to hand, whose name shall show<br>
 The number seventy, life-destroying, fierce,<br>
 Who to the army basely shall betray<br>
 The people of Rome, slain by wickedness<br>
 40 Because of wrath of kings, and he shall hurl</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[18. <i>Shepherds</i>.--Chiefs of the various tribes and nations whom Odenatus subdued.</p>
 <p>21. <i>A dog</i>.--Mæonius, the assassin of Odenatus. Comp. book viii, 208.</p>
 <p>24. <i>Four syllables</i>.--Aureolus.</p>
 <p>29. <i>Both . . . forty</i>.--Macrianus, father and son of same name. But from this point onward the identification of the persons intended is purely conjectural and uncertain.</p>

 <p>Down every city and hut of the Latins.<br>
 And Rome is no more to be seen or heard,<br>
 Such as of late another traveler saw;<br>
 For all these things shall in the ashes lie,<br>
 45 Nor shall there be a sparing of her works;<br>
 For hurtful he himself shall come from heaven,<br>
 God the immortal from the sky shall send<br>
 Lightnings and thunderbolts upon mankind;<br>
 And some he will destroy by lightnings burned,<br>
 50 And others with his mighty thunderbolts.<br>
 And Rome's strong children and the famous Latins<br>
 Shall then the shameless dreadful ruler slay.<br>
 Around him dead the dust shall not lie light,<br>
 But he shall be a sport for dogs and birds<br>
 55 And wolves, for he a martial people spoiled.<br>
     After him, numbering forty, there shall rule<br>
 Another, famous Parthian-destroyer,<br>
 German-destroyer, putting down dread beasts<br>
 That kill men, which upon the ocean's streams<br>
 60 And the Euphrates press continuous on.<br>
 And then shall Rome again be as before.<br>
     But when there comes a great wolf in thy plains,<br>
 A ruler marching onward from the West,<br>
 Then shall he under powerful Ares die<br>
 65 Being cleft asunder by the piercing brass.<br>
     And o'er the very mighty Romans then<br>
 Shall there rule yet again another man<br>
 Of great heart, from. Assyria brought to light,<br>
 Of the first letter, and he shall himself<br>
 70 By means of wars put all things under him,</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[67. <i>Parthian-destroyer</i>.--Macrinus (M = 40).</p>
 <p>62. <i>Wolf</i>.--Reference, perhaps, to Quintilius, the brother of Claudius.</p>

 </font><p>(31-54.)</p>
 <p>{p. 240}</p>
 <p>And by his armies at once power display<br>
 And lay down laws; but him shall brazen Ares<br>
 Quickly destroy by treacherous armies falling.<br>
     After him three of haughty heart shall rule,<br>
 75 One having the first number, one three tens,<br>
 And the other with three hundred shall partake,<br>
 Cruel, who gold and silver in much fire<br>
 Shall melt in statues of gods made with hands,<br>
 And to the armies they, equipped for war,<br>
 80 Will, for the sake of victory, moneys give,<br>
 Dividing many costly things and goods;<br>
 And in like manner, striving eagerly<br>
 After power, they shall barm disastrously<br>
 The arrow-shooting Parthians of the deep<br>
 85 And swift Euphrates, and the hostile Medes,<br>
 And the soft-haired warlike Massagetæ<br>
 And Persians also, quiver-bearing men.<br>
 But when the king shall his own fate unloose<br>
 Leaving unto his sons more fit for arms<br>
 90 The royal scepter and entreating right,<br>
 Then they, forgetful of their father's words<br>
 And having their hands all prepared for war,<br>
 Shall rush in conflict for the royal power.<br>
     And then another lord, of the third number,<br>
 95 Shall rule alone, and smitten by a sword<br>
 Shall quickly see his fate. Then after him<br>
 Shall many perish at each other's hands,<br>
 Being very valiant for the royal power.<br>
     Moreover a great-hearted one shall rule</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[74. <i>Three</i>.--Their names beginning with A, L (A = 30), and T (= 800), the reference might be to Achilleus, whom the people of Palmyra invested with the purple, and Lollian and Tetricus, who, however, belonged to the western provinces.]</p>
 </font><p>(55-78.)</p>
 <p>{p. 241}</p>
 <p>100 The very mighty Romans, an old lord,<br>
 Of the number four, and manage all things well.<br>
     And then upon Phœnicia shall come war<br>
 And conflict, when there shall come nations near<br>
 Of arrow-shooting Persians; ah, how many<br>
 105 Shall before men of barbarous speech fall down!<br>
 Sidon and Tripolis and Berytus<br>
 The loudly-boasting shall behold each other<br>
 Amid the blood and bodies of the dead.<br>
     Wretched Laodicea, round thyself<br>
 110 Thou shalt a great and unsuccessful war<br>
 Stir up through the impiety of men,<br>
     Ah, hapless Tyrians, ye shall gather in<br>
 An evil harvest; when in the day-time<br>
 The sun that lighteth mortals shall withdraw,<br>
 115 And his disk not appear, and drops of blood<br>
 Thick and abundant shall flow down from heaven<br>
 Upon the earth. And then the king shall die,<br>
 Betrayed by his companions. After him<br>
 Shall many shameless leaders still promote<br>
 120 The wicked strife and one another kill.<br>
     And then shall there a reverend ruler be,<br>
 Of much skill, with a name that numbers five,<br>
 Confiding in great armies, whom mankind<br>
 Will fondly love because of royal power;<br>
 125 And having the good name he shall thereto<br>
 Add by good deeds. But while he reigns there shall<br>
 'Twixt Taurus and snow-clad Amanus be<br>
 A fearful sign. From the Cilician land<br>
 A city new and beautiful and strong</p>

 <p>{p. 242}</p>
 <p>130 Shall by the deep strong rivers be destroyed.<br>
 And in Propontis and in Phrygia<br>
 Shall there be many earthquakes. And the king<br>
 Of great renown shall under his own lot<br>
 By wasting deadly sickness lose his life.<br>
 135    And after him shall rule two lordly kings,<br>
 One numbering three hundred, and one three;<br>
 And many shall he utterly destroy<br>
 In defense of the seven-hill city Rome,<br>
 And for the sake of powerful sovereignty.<br>
 140 And then shall evil to the senate come,<br>
 Nor shall it from the angry king escape<br>
 While he holds wrath against it. And a sign<br>
 Shall then appear to all men upon earth;<br>
 And fuller shall the rains be, snow and hail<br>
 145 Shall ruin field-fruits o'er the boundless earth.<br>
 But they shall fall in wars, slain by strong Ares<br>
 In behalf of the war for the Italians.<br>
     And then again another king shall rule,<br>
 Full of devices, gathering all the army,<br>
 150 And for the sake of war distributing<br>
 Money to those with brazen breastplate clad;<br>
 But thereupon shall Nilus, rich in corn,<br>
 Beyond the Libyan mainland irrigate<br>
 For two years the dark soil and fruitful land<br>
 155 Of Egypt; but all things shall famine seize<br>
 And war and robbers, murders, homicides.<br>
 And many cities shall by warlike men<br>
 Be thrown down headlong by the army's hands;<br>
 And he, betrayed, shall fall by gleaming iron.</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[136. <i>Three hundred</i>.--Represented by T, and, according to Ewald's conjecture, here designating Theodosius by his Latin initial. Three.--{Greek <i>G</i>}, initial of Gratian.]</p>
 </font><p>{p. 243}</p>
 <p>160    After him one whose number is three hundred<br>
 Shall rule the Romans, very mighty men;<br>
 He shall stretch forth a life-destroying spear<br>
 Against the Armenians and the Parthians,<br>
 The Assyrians and the Persians firm in war.<br>
 165 And then anew shall a creation be<br>
 Of splendidly built Rome with gold and amber<br>
 And silver and ivory in order raised;<br>
 And in her many people shall abide<br>
 From all the East and from the prosperous West;<br>
 170 And the king shall make other laws for her;<br>
 But then shall death destructive and strong fate<br>
 In turn receive him in a boundless isle.<br>
     And there shall rule another, of ten triads,<br>
 A man like a wild beast, fair-haired and grim,<br>
 175 Who shall be a descendant of the Greeks.<br>
 And then a city of Molossian Phthia<br>
 Feeding much, and Larissa shall be bent<br>
 Down on Peneus's overhanging brows;<br>
 And then too in horse-feeding Scythia<br>
 180 Shall be an insurrection. And dire war<br>
 Shall be hard by the waters of the lake<br>
 Mæotis at streams by the utmost mouth<br>
 Of the fount of watery Phasis on the mead<br>
 Of asphodel; and there shall many fall<br>
 185 By powerful warriors. Ah, how many men<br>
 Shall Ares with strong brass receive! And then,</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[160. <i>Three Hundred</i>.--If the T of line 136 could represent Theodosius, this would most naturally refer to Theodosius the Younger, whom Gratian invested with the purple.</p>

 </font><p align="CENTER">(126-146.)</p>
 <p>{p. 244}</p>
 <p>Having destroyed a Scythian race, the king<br>
 Shall die in his own lot unloosing life.<br>
     And yet another of the number four<br>
 190 Shall rule thereafter, openly made known<br>
 A dreadful man, whom all Armenians,<br>
 Who drink the best ice of the flowing stream<br>
 Araxes, and the Persians of great soul<br>
 Shall fear in wars. And between Colchians<br>
 195 And very strong Pelasgi there shall be<br>
 Wars, fights, and homicides. And those who hold<br>
 The cities of the land of Phrygia<br>
 And those of the Propontis, and make bare<br>
 From out their scabbards the two-edged swords,<br>
 200 Shall smite each other through sore impiousness.<br>
     And then shall God to mortal men display<br>
 From heaven a great sign with the rolling years,<br>
 A bat, the portent of bad war to come.<br>
 And then the king shall not escape stern fate,<br>
 205 But die by hand, slain by the gleaming iron.<br>
     After him, numbering fifty, there shall rule<br>
 Again another coming out of Asia,<br>
 A dreadful terror, fighting hand to hand;<br>
 And he shall set war on Rome's stately walls,<br>
 210 And among Colchians, and Heniochi,<br>
 And the milk-drinking Agathyrsians<br>
 By Euxine sea, at Thracia's sandy bay.<br>
 And then the king shall not escape stern fate,<br>
 And they will tear in pieces his dead corpse.</p>

 </font><p align="CENTER">(147-169.)</p>
 <p>{p. 245}</p>
 <p>215 And then, the king slain, man-ennobling Rome<br>
 Shall be a desert, and much people perish.<br>
     And then again one terrible and dread<br>
 From mighty Egypt shall rule, and destroy<br>
 Great hearted Parthians and Medes and Germans,<br>
 220 And Agathyrsians of the Bosporus,<br>
 Iernians, Britons, and Iberians<br>
 That bear the quiver, bent Massagetæ,<br>
 And Persians thinking themselves more than men.<br>
     And then a famous man shall look upon<br>
 225 All Hellas, acting as an enemy<br>
 To Scythia and windy Caucasas.<br>
 And there shall be a dread sign while he rules:<br>
 Crowns altogether like the shining stars<br>
 Shall from heaven in the south and north appear.<br>
 230 And then shall he bequeath the royal power<br>
 To his son whose initial letter heads<br>
 The alphabet, when in the halls of Hades<br>
 The manly king in his own lot shall go.<br>
 But when the son of this man in the land<br>
 235 Of Rome shall rule, shown by the number one,<br>
 There shall be over all the earth great peace<br>
 Much longed for, and the Latins will love him<br>
 As king because of his own father's worth;<br>
 Him, eager to go both to East and West,<br>
 240 The Roman people shall against his will<br>
 Retain at home and in command of Rome,<br>
 For among all there is a friendly heart</p>

 <p>Felt for their royal and illustrious lord.<br>
 But baneful death shall snatch him out of life,<br>
 245 Short-lived, abandoned to his destiny.<br>
     But others afterwards again shall smite<br>
 Each other, powerful warriors, carrying on<br>
 An evil strife, not holding kingly power,<br>
 But being tyrants. And in all the world<br>
 250 Shall they bring many evil things to pass,<br>
 But chiefly for the Romans till the time<br>
 Of the third Dionysus, until armed<br>
 With helmet Ares shall from Egypt come,<br>
 Whom they shall surname Dionysus lord.<br>
 255 But when the famous royal purple cloak<br>
 A murderous lion and murderous lioness<br>
 Shall rend, together they shall grasp the lungs<br>
 Of the changed kingdom; then a holy king,<br>
 Whose name has the first letter, pressing hard<br>
 260 For victory, shall cast down hostile chiefs<br>
 To be the food of dogs and birds of prey.<br>
     Alas for thee, O city burned with fire,<br>
 O powerful Rome! How many things must thou<br>
 Needs suffer when all these things come to pass!<br>
 265 But the great far-famed king shall afterward<br>
 Raise thee all up again with gold and amber<br>
 And silver and ivory, and in the world<br>
 Thou shalt in thy possessions foremost be,<br>
 Also in temples, market-places, wealth,<br>
 270 And race-grounds; and then shalt thou be again<br>
 A light for all, even as thou wast before.<br>
 Ah, wretched Cecropes and Cadmeans</p>

 Around Peneus and Molossian stream<br>
 275 Thick grown with rushes, Tricca and Dodona,<br>
 And high-built Ithome, Pierian ridge<br>
 Around the summit of Olympian mount,<br>
 Ossa, Larissa, and high-gate Calydon.<br>
     But when God shall for mortals bring to pass<br>
 280 A great sign, day dark twilight round the world,<br>
 Even then to thee, O king, the end shall come,<br>
 Nor is it possible that thou escape<br>
 A brother's piercing dart against thee hurled.<br>
     And then again shall rule a life-destroyer,<br>
 285 A fiery eagle from the royal race,<br>
 Who shall of Egypt's offspring take fast hold,<br>
 Younger, but than his brother much more strong,<br>
 Who has for his first sign the number eighty.<br>
 And then the whole world shall for honor's sake<br>
 290 Bear in its lap the soul-distressing wrath<br>
 Of the immortal God; and there shall come<br>
 On mortal men, the creatures of a day,<br>
 Famines and plagues and wars and homicides,<br>
 And an incessant darkness o'er the earth,<br>
 295 Mother of peoples, and relentless wrath<br>
 From heaven, and disorder of the times,<br>
 And earthquake shocks, and flaming thunderbolts,<br>
 And stones and storms of rain and squalid drops.<br>
 And the high summits of the Phrygian land<br>
 300 Feel the shock, bases of the Scythian hills<br>
 Feel the shock, cities tremble, and all earth<br>
 Trembles at the cliffs of the land of Greece.<br>

 <p>Shall fall prone under burning thunderbolts<br>

 Struck as if he were no one by his men.<br>
     After him of the Latins many men<br>
 310 Wearing the purple mantle on their shoulders<br>
 Shall be again raised up, who shall by lot<br>
 Desire to lay hold on the royal power.<br>
     And then upon the stately walls of Rome<br>
 Shall be three kings, two having the first number,<br>
 315 And one the eponym of victory<br>
 Bearing as no one else. They shall love Rome<br>
 And all the world, concerned for mortal men;<br>
 But they shall not accomplish anything;<br>
 For God has not been gracious to the world<br>
 320 Neither will he be gentle with mankind,<br>
 Because they have done many evil things.<br>
 Therefore to kings shall he a mean soul bring<br>
 Still worse than that of leopards and of wolves;<br>
 For harshly seizing them with their own hands,<br>
 325 Like feeble women who are idly slain,<br>
 Shall men in brazen breastplate utterly<br>
 Destroy the kings together with their scepters.<br>
 Ah, wretched lofty men of glorious Rome,<br>
 Trusting in false oaths ye shall be destroyed.<br>

 For twelve months wheat and barley in abundance,<br>

 Shall it again be prosperous not a little;<br>

 The lofty-minded. And when he shall come<br>
 Unto the dark sea of Assyria<br>
 He shall despoil Phœnicians in their homes,<br>
 And fastening evil war and battle dire<br>
 375 Shall be one lord of the two lords of earth.<br>
     And now will I for Alexandrians sing<br>
 Their grievous end; alas, barbarians<br>
 Shall possess sacred Egypt, land unharmed,<br>
 Unshaken, when wrath from the gods shall come.<br>

 380 . . . making winter summer,<br>
     Then shall the oracles be all fulfilled.<br>
 But when three youths in the Olympian games<br>
 Shall conquer, and thou shalt bid them that know<br>
 The oracles that call on God to cleanse<br>
 385 First by the blood of sucking quadruped,<br>
 Thrice therefore shall the Most High then bring on<br>
 A fearful lot, and be shall over all<br>
 Brandish the mournful long spear; then much blood</p>

 390 When the city shall be plundered utterly<br>
 By inhospitable strangers. Happy he<br>
 Who is dead, also happy any one<br>
 Who is without a child; for he who once<br>
 Was leader surnamed for them that are free,<br>
 395 Far-famed in song, no longer in his mind<br>
 Revolving earlier plans, shall place their neck<br>
 Under a servile yoke; such slavery,<br>
 Cause of much weeping, shall a lord impose.<br>
     And then straightway an army of Sicilians<br>
 400 Ill-fated shall come, carrying dismay,<br>
 When a barbarian nation shall again<br>
 Come suddenly; and the fruit, when it grows,<br>
 They from the field shall sever. Upon them<br>
 Shall God the lofty Thunderer bestow<br>
 405 Evil instead of good; continually<br>
 Shall stranger pluck from stranger hateful gold.<br>
     But now when all shall look upon the blood<br>
 Of the flesh-eating lion and there comes<br>
 Upon the body a murderous lioness,<br>
 410 Down from his head will be the scepter cast<br>
 Away from him. And as in friendly feast<br>
 In Egypt when the people all partake,<br>
 They perform valiant deeds, and one restrains<br>
 Another, and among them there is much<br>
 415 Shouting aloud; so also shall there be<br>
 Upon mankind the fear of furious strife,<br>
 And many shall be utterly destroyed<br>
 And others kill each other by hard fights.</p>

 <p>    And then one, covered with dark scales shall come;<br>
 420 Two others shall come acting in concert<br>
 With one another, and with them a third<br>
 A great ram from Cyrene, whom before<br>
 1 spoke of as a fugitive in war<br>
 Beside the streams of Nile; but in no wise<br>
 425 An unsuccessful way do all complete.<br>
     And then the lengths of the revolving years<br>
 Shall be exceeding quiet; yet again<br>
 Thereafter shall a second war for them<br>
 In Egypt be stirred up, and there shall be<br>
 430 A battle on the sea, but victory<br>
 Shall not be theirs. Ah, wretched ones, there shall<br>
 A conquest of the famous city be,<br>
 And it shall be a spoil of war not long.<br>
     And then men having common boundaries<br>
 435 Of much land shall flee wretched, and shall lead<br>
 Their wretched parents. And they shall again<br>
 Having great victory light on a land,<br>
 And shall destroy the Jews, men staunch in war,<br>
 Wasting by wars far as the hoary deep,<br>
 440 On both sides, fighting in the foremost ranks<br>
 For father-land and parents. And a race<br>
 Of trophy-bearing men shall for the dead<br>
 Be reckoned. Ah, how many men shall swim<br>
 About the waves! For on the sandy beach<br>
 445 Many shall lie; and heads of golden hair<br>
 Shall fall beneath Egyptian winged fowls.<br>
 And then for the Arabians mortal blood</p>

 <p>Shall go in quest. But when wolves shall with dogs<br>
 Pledge in a sea-girt island solemn oaths,<br>
 450 Then shall there be the raising of a tower,<br>
 And the city that suffered very many things<br>
 Men shall inhabit. For deceitful gold<br>
 Shall no more be nor silver, nor acquiring<br>
 Of the earth, nor much-laboring servitude;<br>
 455 But one fast friendship and one mode of life<br>
 With cheerful soul; and all things shall be common<br>
 And equal light among the means of life.<br>
 And wickedness shall sink down from the earth<br>
 Into the vast sea. And then near at hand<br>
 460 Is come the harvest-time of mortal men.<br>
 There is imposed a strong necessity<br>
 That these things be fulfilled. And at that time<br>
 There shall not any other traveler say,<br>
 In this conjecturing, that the race of men<br>
 465 Though perishable shall ever cease to be.<br>
 And then a holy nation shall prevail<br>
 And hold the sovereignty of all the earth<br>
 Unto all ages with their mighty sons.</p>
