 <h3 align="CENTER">BOOK XII.</h3>
 <p>BUT come now, hear of me the mournful time<br>
 Of sons of Latium; and first of all<br>
 After the kings of Egypt were destroyed,<br>
 And the like earth had downwards borne them all,<br>
 5 And after Pella's townsman, under whom<br>
 The whole East and the rich West were cast down,<br>
 Whom Babylon dishonored, and stretched out<br>
 For Philip a dead body (not of Zeus,<br>
 Of Ammon not true things were prophesied),<br>
 10 And after that one of the race and blood<br>
 Of king Assaracus, who came from Troy,<br>
 Even he who cleft the violence of fire,<br>
 And after many lords, and after men<br>
 To Ares dear, and after the young babes,<br>
 15 The children of the beast that feeds on sheep,<br>
 And after the passing of six hundred years<br>
 And decades two of Rome's dictatorship,<br>
 The very first lord, from the western sea,<br>
 Shall be of Rome the ruler, very strong<br>
 20 And warlike, the initial of whose name<br>
 Begins the letters, and fast binding thee,<br>
 O thou of goodly fruit, he shall be full<br>
 Of man-destroying Ares; thou shalt pay</p>

 <p>{p. 210}</p>
 <p>The outrage which thou willing didst force on;<br>
 For he, great soul, shall be the best in wars;<br>
 25 Before him Thrace and Sicily shall crouch,<br>
 With Memphis, Memphis cast headlong to earth<br>
 By reason of the wickedness of rulers<br>
 And of a woman unenslaved who falls<br>
 Under the spear. And laws will he ordain<br>
 30 For peoples and put all things under him;<br>
 Having great fame he shall wield scepter long;<br>
 For no short time shall he last nor shall ever<br>
 Be other greater scepter-bearing king<br>
 35 Than this one, o'er the Romans, not one hour,<br>
 For God did lavish all things upon him,<br>
 And also in the noble earth he showed<br>
 Great marvelous seasons, and with them showed signs.<br>
     But when a radiant star all like the sun<br>
 40 Shall shine forth out of heaven in the mid days,<br>
 Then shall the secret Word of the Most High<br>
 Come clothed in flesh like mortals; but with him<br>
 The might of Rome and of the illustrious Latins<br>
 Shall increase. But the mighty king himself<br>
 45 Shall under his appointed lot expire,<br>
 Transmitting to another royal power.<br>
 But after him a man, a warrior strong,<br>
 Wearing the purple mantle on his shoulders,<br>
 Shall bear rule, and with his initial be<br>
 50 Numbers three hundred, and he shall destroy<br>
 The Medes and arrow-hurling Parthians;<br>
 And he himself by his power shall subvert</p>

 <p>The high-gate city; and again shall come<br>
 Evil to Egypt and the Assyrians,<br>
 55 And to the Colchian Heniochi,<br>
 And to those by the waters of the Rhine,<br>
 The Germans dwelling o'er the sandy shores.<br>
 And he himself shall ravage afterwards<br>
 The high-gate city near Eridanus<br>
 60 Which is devising evils. And then he<br>
     Shall forthwith fall down, struck by gleaming iron.<br>
 And afterwards shall rule another man<br>
 Weaving guile, and the initial of his name<br>
 Will show the number three; and he much gold<br>
 65 Shall gather; and with him there shall not be<br>
 Satiety of wealth, but plundering more<br>
 Recklessly he'll put all things in the earth.<br>
 But peace shall come, and Ares shall desist<br>
 From wars; and he shall make known many things<br>
 70 In divination of the greatest things,<br>
 Inquiring for the sake of means of life;<br>
 Yet there shall be on him the greatest sign:<br>
 From heaven down on the king while perishing<br>
 There shall flow many little drops of blood.<br>
 75 And many lawless things will he perform,<br>
 And put around the neck of Romans pain<br>
 Trusting in divination; and the heads<br>
 Of the assembly he will also slay.<br>
 And famine shall seize Cappadocians,<br>
 80 And Thracians, Macedonians, and Italians.</p>

 <p>{p. 212}</p>
 <p>And Egypt shall alone feed numerous tribes;<br>
 And the king himself beguiling secretly<br>
 Shall craftily destroy the virgin maid;<br>
 But her the citizens in tearful grief<br>
 85 Shall bury; and against the king they all<br>
 Holding wrath shall abuse him craftily.<br>
 While strong Rome blossoms the strong man shall perish.<br>
     And again there shall rule another lord<br>
 Of the number of twice ten; and then shall come<br>
 90 Unto the Sauromatians and to Thrace<br>
 And the Triballi, famed for hurling darts,<br>
 Wars and sad cares; and Roman Ares shall<br>
 Tear all in pieces. And a fearful sign<br>
 Shall there be when this man shall rule the land<br>
 95 Of the Italians and Pannonians;<br>
 And there shall be at the mid hour of day<br>
 Dark night around them and then from the heaven<br>
 A shower of stones; and thereupon the lord<br>
 And vigorous judge of the Italians<br>
 100 Shall go in Hades' halls by his own fate.<br>
     Again another fearful man shall come<br>
 And dreadful, numbering fifty; and from all<br>
 The cities many noblest citizens<br>
 Born to wealth he shall utterly destroy,<br>
 105 A dreadful serpent breathing grievous war,<br>
 Who sometime stretching forth his hands shall make<br>
 An end of his own race and stir all things,<br>
 Acting the athlete, driving chariots,</p>

 <p>Putting to death and daring countless things;<br>
 110 And he shall cleave the mountain of two seas,<br>
 And sprinkle it with gore. And out of sight<br>
 Shall also vanish the destructive man;<br>
 Then making himself equal unto God<br>
 Shall he return, but God will prove him naught.<br>
 115 And while he rules there shall be peace profound<br>
 And not the fears of men; and from the ocean<br>
 Flowing, and cleaving by Ausonia,<br>
 Shall come untrodden water; and around<br>
 Looking with anxious care he will appoint<br>
 120 His very many contests for the people,<br>
 And he himself an actor will contend<br>
 With voice and cithara, and sing a song<br>
 Along with harp-string; later he will flee<br>
 And leave the royal power, and perishing<br>
 125 Illy will he repay the harm he wrought.<br>
     After him three shall rule and two of them<br>
 Shall have the number seventy by their names,<br>
 And in addition to these shall be one<br>
 Of the third letter; and one here, one there,<br>
 130 Shall perish by strong Ares' sturdy hands.<br>
 Then shall a mighty ruler of men come,<br>
 Destroyer of the pious, strong-minded man,<br>
 Spear-wielding Ares, whom seven times the tenth<br>
 Shall point out clearly; he shall overthrow<br>
 135 Phœnicia and destroy Assyria.<br>
 A sword shall come upon the sacred land<br>
 Of Solyma even to the utmost bend<br>
 Of the Tiberian sea. Alas, alas,<br>
 Phœnicia, O how much shalt thou endure,<br>
 140 Grief-laden with thy trophies tightly bound,</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[126-131. Comp. book v, 50-53.]</p>
 </font><p align="CENTER">(83-106.)</p>
 <p>{p. 214}</p>
 <p>And every nation shall upon thee tread.<br>
 Alas, alas, to the Assyrians<br>
 Shalt thou come and shalt see young children serve<br>
 Among unfriendly men and with the wives,<br>
 145 And every means of life and wealth shall perish;<br>
 For on thee God's wrath causing grievous woe<br>
 Shall come, because they did not keep his law,<br>
 But served all idols with unseemly arts.<br>
 And many wars and fights and homicides,<br>
 150 Famines, and pestilences, and confusion<br>
 Of cities shall be. But the reverend king<br>
 Of mighty soul shall at the end of life<br>
 Himself fall by a strong necessity.<br>
     Then shall two other chief men, cherishing<br>
 155 The memory of their father, great king, rule,<br>
 And in contending warriors glory much.<br>
     And (one) of these shall be a noble man<br>
 And lordly, whose name shall three hundred hold;<br>
 Yet he shall also fall by treachery,<br>
 160 Not in the warring companies stretched out,<br>
 But struck in Rome's plain by the two-edged brass.<br>
     And after him a powerful warlike man<br>
 Of the letter four shall rule the mighty realm,<br>
 Whom all men on the boundless earth shall love,<br>
 165 And then shall there be over all the world<br>
 A rest from war. Yet all, from west to east,<br>
 Shall serve him willingly, not by constraint,<br>
 And cities shall be under his control<br>
 And of themselves be subject. For to him<br>
 170 Shall heavenly Sabaoth much glory bring,<br>
 The imperishable God who dwells on high.</p>

 </font><p align="CENTER">(106-132.)</p>
 <p>{p. 215}</p>
 <p>And then shall famine waste Pannonia<br>
 And all the Celtic land, and shall destroy<br>
 One here, another there. And there shall be<br>
 175 For the Assyrians, whom Orontes laves,<br>
 Structures and ornament and what may seem<br>
 Yet greater anywhere. And the great king<br>
 Shall have a fondness for these and love them<br>
 Above the others far (and there are many);<br>
 180 But he himself shall in mid breast receive<br>
 A great wound, and seized at the end of life<br>
 Craftily, by a friend, in hallowed house<br>
 Of the great royal hall shall he fall down<br>
 Wounded; and after him shall be a ruler<br>
 185 Numbering fifty, venerable man,<br>
 Who above measure shall destroy from Rome<br>
 Many inhabitants and citizens;<br>
 But he shall rule few; for in Hades' halls<br>
 For a former king's sake he shall wounded go.<br>
 190    But then another king, a warrior strong,<br>
 Who has three hundred for initial sign,<br>
 Shall bear rule and lay waste the Thracians' land<br>
 Which is much varied, and he shall destroy<br>
 The powerful Germans dwelling by the Rhine<br>
 195 And the Iberians that shoot the arrow.<br>
 Moreover, there shall be unto the Jews<br>
 Another greatest evil, and with them<br>
 Bedewed with murder shall Phœnicia drink;<br>
 And the walls of the Assyrians shall fall<br>
 200 By many warriors. And again a man<br>
 Destroying life shall waste them utterly.</p>

 <p>And then shall threatenings of the mighty God,<br>
 Earthquakes, and great plagues be on every land,<br>
 Untimely snow-storms, and strong thunderbolts.<br>
 205 And then the great king, mountain-roaming Celt,<br>
 Shall for the toil of Ares not escape<br>
 A fate unseemly, hastening eagerly<br>
 After the strife of battle, but worn out<br>
 Shall he be; foreign dust shall hide his corpse,<br>
 210 But dust that of Nemea's flower has name.<br>
 And after him another shall arise,<br>

 Shall be his name, and of four syllables,<br>

 215 Presenting. Temples he shall dedicate<br>
 In all the cities, watching o'er the world<br>
 By his own foot, and bringing gifts away,<br>
 Both gold and amber much will he supply<br>
 For many; and magicians' mysteries<br>
 220 All will he from the sanctuaries keep;<br>
 And what is much more excellent for men<br>
 Will he place . . . ruling . . . thunderbolt;<br>
 And great peace shall be when he shall be lord;<br>
 And he shall be a minstrel of rich voice<br>
 225 And a participant in lawful things,<br>
 And a just minister of what is right;<br>
 But he shall fall, unloosing his own fate.<br>

 Bear the rule; and another after him<br>
 Shall be commander, of tens numbering seven;<br>
 And their names shall be honored; and they shall<br>
 Themselves destroy men marked by many a spot,<br>
 235 Britons and mighty Moors and Dacians<br>
 And the Arabians. But when the last<br>
 Of these shall perish, fearful Ares then,<br>
 He that before was wounded, shall again<br>
 Against the Parthians come, and utterly<br>
 240 Shall he destroy them. And then shall the king<br>
 Himself fall by a treacherous wild beast<br>
 Training his hands--excuse itself of death.<br>
     And after him another man shall rule,<br>
 In many wise things skilled, and he shall have<br>
 245 Himself the name of the first mighty king<br>
 Of the first unit; and he shall be good<br>
 And mighty; and for the illustrious Latins<br>
 Shall this strong one accomplish many things<br>
 In memory of his father; and forthwith<br>
 250 Shall he adorn the walls of Rome with gold<br>
 And silver and ivory; and he shall go<br>
 Within the market places and the temples<br>
 With a strong man. And sometime direst wound<br>
 Shall shoot up like ears in the Roman wars;</p>

 When a great sign of God shall be displayed<br>
 From heaven, and shall for the king's piety<br>
 Save men in brazen armor and distress;<br>
 For God who is in heaven and hears all things<br>
 260 Shall wet him with unseasonable rain<br>
 When he prays. But when these things are fulfilled<br>
 Of which I spoke, then with the rolling years<br>
 Shall also the renowned dominion cease<br>
 Of the great pious king; and at the end<br>
 265 Of his life, having then proclaimed his son<br>
 Succeeding to the kingdom, he shall die<br>
 By his own lot and leave the royal power<br>
 Unto the ruler with the golden hair,<br>
 Who with two tens in his name, born a king<br>
 270 From the race of his father, shall receive<br>
 Dominion. This man with superior powers<br>
 Of mind shall grasp all things; and he shall rival<br>
 Great-hearted overweening Hercules,<br>
 And be the best in mighty arms and have<br>
 275 The greatest fame in chase and horsemanship;<br>

 Shall come to pass along with mournful cares,<br>
 When the king himself, exceeding mad with love,<br>

 Shaming his youthful offspring, infamous<br>

 And then, in helpless loneliness concealed,<br>

 Into my heart the oracle divine--<br>
 Make thou the word cease; for I do not know<br>
 What things I say; for thou art in me he<br>
 That speaketh all these things. Now let me rest<br>
 380 A little and put from my heart aside<br>
 The charming song; for weary is my heart<br>
 Foretelling with divine words royal power.</p>
