 <h3 align="CENTER">BOOK VIII.</h3>
 <p>GOD'S declarations of great wrath to come<br>
 In the last age upon the faithless world<br>
 I make known, prophesying to all men<br>
 According to their cities. From the time<br>
 5 When the great tower fell and the tongues of men<br>
 Were parted into many languages<br>
 Of mortals, first was Egypt's royal power<br>
 Established, that of Persians and of Medes<br>
 And also of the Ethiopians<br>
 10 And of Assyria and Babylon,<br>
 Then the great pride of boasting Macedon,<br>
 Then, fifth, the famous lawless kingdom last<br>
 Of the Italians shall show many evils<br>
 Unto all mortals and shall spend the toils<br>
 15 Of men of every land. And it shall lead<br>
 The untamed kings of nations to the West,<br>
 Make laws for peoples and subject all things.<br>
 Late do the mills of God grind the fine flour.<br>
 Fire then shall destroy all things and give back<br>
 20 To fine dust the heads of the high-leafed hills</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[1. This eighth book is remarkably fragmentary, and touches on a wide range of topics. It is obviously of Christian authorship, and contains (lines 284-330) the famous Sibylline acrostic of the name of Jesus Christ.</p>

 <p>And of all flesh. First cause of ills to all<br>
 Are covetousness and a lack of sense.<br>
 For there shall be love of deceitful gold<br>
 And silver; for than these did mortals choose<br>
 15 Naught greater, neither light of sun nor heaven,<br>
 Nor sea, nor broad-backed earth whence all things grow,<br>
 Nor God who giveth all things, of all things<br>
 The Father, nor yet faith and piety<br>
 Chose they before them. Of impiety<br>
 30 A fount, and of disorder forward guide,<br>
 An instrument of wars and foe of peace<br>
 Is lack of sense, that sets at enmity<br>
 Parents and children. And along with gold<br>
 Shall marriage not be honorable at all.<br>
 35 And the land shall have its borders and each sea<br>
 Its watchers craftily distributed<br>
 To all those that have gold; for ages thus<br>
 Shall those who purpose to possess the land<br>
 That feedeth many plunder laboring men,<br>
 40 In order that, procuring larger space,<br>
 They may enslave them by a false pretense.<br>
 And if the huge earth from the starry heaven<br>
 Held not her throne far off there had not been<br>
 For men an equal light, but, bought with gold,<br>
 45 It had belonged to rich men and God must<br>
 For poor men have prepared another world.<br>
     There shall come to thee sometime from above<br>
 A heavenly stroke deserved, O haughty Rome.<br>
 And thou shalt be the first to bend thy neck<br>
 50 And be rased to the ground, and thee shall fire<br>
 Destructive utterly consume, cast down<br>
 Upon thy pavements, and thy wealth shall perish,</p>

 <p>{p. 163}</p>
 <p>And wolves and foxes dwell in thy foundations.<br>
 And then shalt thou be wholly desolate,<br>
 55 As if not born. Where thy Palladium then?<br>
 What god shall save thee, whether wrought of gold<br>
 Or stone or brass? Or then where thy decrees<br>
 Of senate? Where shall be the race of Rhea,<br>
 Of Cronus, or of Zeus, and of all those<br>
 60 Whom thou didst worship, demons without life,<br>
 Images of the worn-out dead, whose tombs<br>
 Crete the ill-starred shall hold a cause of pride,<br>
 And honor the unconscious dead with thrones?<br>
     But when thou shalt have had voluptuous kings<br>
 65 Thrice five, enslaving the world from the east<br>
 Unto the west, there shall be then a lord<br>
 Gray-headed, having name of the near sea,<br>
 The world inspecting with a nimble foot,<br>
 Bringing gifts, having large amount of gold<br>
 70 And plundering hateful silver even more,<br>
 And stripping it off he shall pick it up.<br>
 And he shall have part in all mysteries<br>
 Of Magian shrines, display his child as god,<br>
 Abolish all things sacred, and disclose<br>
 75 The ancient mysteries of deceit to all.<br>
 Sad then the time when he himself, sad one,<br>
 Shall perish. And yet shall the people say:<br>
 "Thy mighty strength, O city, shall fall down,"<br>
 At once perceiving that the evil day</p>

 100 Shall be for thee no longer, nor shalt thou,<br>
 Ill-fated, ever be raised up again,<br>

 Of eagle-bearing legions shall fall low.<br>

 <p>To the tribunal come to judge the souls<br>
 Of the living and the dead and all the world.<br>
 110 And parents shall not be to children dear<br>
 Nor children to their parents, on account<br>
 Of their impiety and their distress<br>
 Unlooked-for. Thine thenceforth shall gnashing be<br>
 And scattering and conquest, and when the fall<br>
 115 Of cities comes and yawnings of the earth.<br>
     When a dragon charged with fire in both his eyes<br>
 And with full belly shall come on the waves<br>
 And shall afflict thy children, and there be<br>
 Famine and war of kinsmen, near at hand<br>
 120 Is the end of the world and the last day<br>
 And judgment of the immortal God for them<br>
 That are approved and chosen. And there shall<br>
 Against the Romans first of all be wrath<br>
 Implacable, and there, come a time<br>
 125 Of drinking blood and wretched course of life.<br>
 Alas, alas for thee, thou reckless land,<br>
 Great barbarous nation; thou didst not perceive<br>
 Whence naked and unworthy thou didst come<br>
 To the sun's light, that to that place again<br>
 130 Naked thou mightest withdraw and afterwards<br>
 Come unto judgment, as unjustly judging. . . .<br>
 With hands gigantic coming from on high<br>
 Alone through all the world thou, shalt abide<br>
 Under the earth. By naphtha and asphalt<br>
 135 And brimstone and much fire thou utterly<br>
 Shalt disappear and shalt be burning dust<br>
 For ages; and each one who sees shall hear<br>
 From Hades a great mournful bellowing</p>

 <p>And gnashing of teeth, and thee noisily<br>
 140 Beating with thine own hands thy godless breast.<br>
 For all together there is equal night;<br>
 For rich and poor; and naked from the earth<br>
 Naked again to earth they haste away<br>
 And cease from life when they complete their time.<br>
 145 No slave is there, nor any lord, nor tyrant,<br>
 Nor king, nor leader having much conceit,<br>
 Nor speaker learned in law, nor magistrate<br>
 Judging for money; nor do they pour out<br>
 The blood of sacrifices in libations<br>
 150 Upon the altars; there sounds not a drum<br>
 Nor cymbal. . . .<br>
 Nor perforated flute that has a power<br>
 To madden mind itself, nor sound of pipe<br>
 That bean the likeness of a crooked snake,<br>
 155 Nor trumpet, harsh-toned messenger of wars;<br>
 Nor those made drunken in the lawless feasts<br>
 Of revelry, nor in the choral dance;<br>
 Nor sound of harp, nor harmful instrument;<br>
 Nor strife, nor anger manifold, nor sword<br>
 160 Is with the dead; but an eternity<br>
 Common to all is keeper of the key<br>
 Of the great prison before God's judgment-seat<br>
 With images of gold and silver and stone<br>
 Ye are ready, that unto the bitter day<br>
 165 Ye may come to see your first punishment,<br>
 O Rome, and gnashing of teeth. And no more<br>
 Shall Syrian or Greek lay down his neck<br>
 Beneath thy servile yoke, nor foreigner,</p>

 <p>Nor other nation. Plundered thou shalt be<br>
 170 And made to suffer what thou didst exact,<br>
 And in fear wailing thou shalt give, until<br>
 Thou pay back all things; and thou for the world<br>
 Shalt be a triumph and reproach of all.<br>
     Then shall the sixth race of the Latin kings<br>
 175 End life at last and scepters leave behind<br>
 From the same race another king shall reign,<br>
 Who shall rule every land and scepters wield;<br>
 And having full power, and by the decrees<br>
 Of God most mighty, shall his children rule,<br>
 180 And of unshaken children is his race;<br>
 For thus it is decreed while time moves round,<br>
 When there shall be of Egypt thrice five kings.<br>
     Thereafter when the limit of the time<br>
 Of the Phenix shall come round, there shall a race<br>
 185 Of peoples come to plunder, tribes confused,<br>
 Enemy of the Hebrews. Then shall Ares<br>
 Go plundering Ares; and he shall himself<br>
 Destroy the haughty threatening of the Romans.<br>
 For Rome's power perished then while in its bloom;<br>
 190 An ancient queen with cities dwelling round,<br>
 No longer shall the land of fertile Rome<br>
 Prevail, when out of Asia one shall come</p>

 All these things, to the city afterwards<br>

 When, taking thee by force, an ill-starred fate<br>
 Shall come upon thee and complete thy name.<br>
     Ah me, I the thrice wretched, shall I see<br>
 200 Sometime that day to thee destructive, Rome,<br>
 But to all Latins most? It honors him<br>
 With counsels who goes, up on Trojan car<br>
 With hidden children from the Asian land,<br>
 Having a fiery soul. But when he shall<br>
 205 Cut through the isthmus looking wistfully,<br>
 Moving against all, passing o'er the sea,<br>
 Then shall dark blood pursue the mighty beast.<br>
 And a dog chased the lion which destroys<br>
 The shepherds. And then shall they take away<br>
 210 His scepter and to Hades he shall pass.<br>
     And unto Rhodes shall come an evil last,<br>
 But greatest, There shall also be for Thebes<br>
 An evil conquest afterwards, And Egypt</p>

 Escaped headlong destruction afterwards,<br>

 And Rome shall be a room, and Delos dull,<br>
 And Samos sand. . . .<br>
 220 Later again thereafter there shall come<br>
 An evil to the Persians for their pride,<br>
 And all their insolence shall come to naught.<br>
     And then a holy Lord of all the earth<br>
 Having raised up the dead shall wield the scepter<br>
 225 Unto all ages. Thrice then unto Rome<br>
 Will the Most High bring pitiable fate<br>
 And unto all men, and by their own works<br>
 They'll perish; but they would not be persuaded,<br>
 Which would have been much more, to be desired.<br>
 230 But when forthwith there shall increase for ill<br>
 An evil day of famine and of plague<br>
 And of intolerable battle-din,<br>

 Shall, having called the senate, counsel take<br>

 Of poisonous sowings. But with shameless soul<br>
 Shall they again act, fearing not the wrath<br>

 A brilliant cornet, sign of much distress<br>
 About to come, of war and battle-strife.<br>

 But then when heavenly grace shall reign within,<br>
 And when the holy child shall crush with bonds<br>
 The mischievous destroyer of all men,<br>
 Opening the depth to view, and suddenly<br>

 Within the house of Hades, afterwards<br>

 And God himself shall increase many evils<br>

 <p>284-330. This passage is celebrated as being an acrostic of thirty-four lines in the Greek text, the first letters of which lines form the title given above, namely, JESUS CHRIST, SON OF GOD, SAVIOUR, CROSS. It is quoted in full by Eusebius in his report of Constantine's Oration to the Assembly of the Saints, xviii [G., 20, 1288, 1289], and, excepting the seven lines representing the word CROSS, by Augustine, <i>de Civitate Dei</i>, xviii, 123 [L., 41, 5791. We give in our text a faithful translation of the Greek without any {footnote p. 172} attempt to transfer it into a corresponding English acrostic, but in the Appendix of this volume (pp. 274-277) the reader may find several English translations which aim to reproduce the acrostic form of the original. To the picture of the day of judgment as given in this acrostic there is obvious allusion at the beginning of the famous medieval hymn:</p><dir>

 <p>Faithful and faithless mortals shall see God<br>
 The Most High with the saints at the end of time.<br>
 290 And of men bearing flesh he judges souls<br>
 Upon his throne, when sometime the whole world<br>
 Shall be a desert and a place of thorns.<br>
 And mortals shall their idols cast away<br>
 And all wealth. And the searching fire shall burn<br>
 1295 Earth, heaven, and sea; and it shall burn the gates,<br>
 Of Hades' prison. Then shall come all flesh<br>
 Of the dead to the free light of the saints;<br>
 But the lawless shall that fire whirl round and round.<br>
 For ages. Howsoever much one did<br>
 300 In secret, then shall he all things declare;<br>
 For God shall open dark breasts to the light.<br>
 And lamentation shall there be from all<br>
 And gnashing of teeth. Brightness of the, sun<br>
 Shall be eclipsed and dances of the stars.<br>
 305 He shall roll up the heaven; and of the moon<br>
 The light shall perish. And he shall exalt<br>
 The valleys and destroy the heights of hills,<br>
 And height no longer shall appear remaining<br>
 Among men. And the hills shall with the plains<br>
 310 Be level and no more on any sea<br>

 From heaven a very lamentable sound,<br>

 And the world's woes. And then the yawning earth<br>
 Shall show Tartarean chaos. And all kings<br>
 Shall come unto the judgement seat of God.<br>
 And there shall out of heaven a stream of fire<br>
 320 And brimstone flow. But for all mortals then<br>
 Shall there a sign be, a distinguished seal,<br>
 The Wood among believers, and the horn<br>
 Fondly desired, the life of pious men,<br>
 But it shall be stumbling block of the world,<br>
 325 Giving illumination to the elect<br>
 By water in twelve springs; and there shall rule<br>
 A shepherding iron rod. This one who now<br>
 Is in acrostics which give signs of God<br>
 Thus written openly, the Saviour is,<br>
 330 Immortal King, who suffered for our sake;<br>

 Holy arms, conquering Amalek by faith,<br>
 That the people might know him to be elect<br>

 I now by my hands, and thou by the Word<br>
 355 In after time shalt for our form provide<br>
 That we may jointly cause it to arise."<br>
 Keeping in mind this purpose he shall come<br>
 To the creation, to a holy virgin<br>
 Bringing the likeness antitypical,<br>
 360 Baptizing with water by the elders' hands,<br>
 And by the Word accomplishing all things,<br>
 And healing every sickness. By his word<br>
 He winds shall he make cease, and with his foot<br>
 Shall calm the raging sea, walking thereon<br>
 365 In peaceful faith. And from five loaves of bread<br>
 And a fish of the sea live thousand men<br>
 Shall he fill in the desert, and then taking<br>

 And silent he will be when buffeted<br>

 Or whence he came, that he may talk to the dead.<br>
