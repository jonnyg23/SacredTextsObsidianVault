 <h2 align="CENTER">ORPHEUS AND EURYDICE- ARISTAEUS- AMPHION- LINUS-</h2>
 <h3 align="CENTER">THAMYRIS- MARSYAS- MELAMPUS- MUSAEUS.</h3>
 
 <h3 align="CENTER">ORPHEUS AND EURYDICE.</h3>
 
 
 <p>ORPHEUS was the son of Apollo and the Muse Calliope. He was
 presented by his father with a lyre and taught to play upon it,
 which he did to such perfection that nothing could withstand the charm
 of his music. Not only his fellow-mortals, but wild beasts were
 softened by his strains, and gathering round him laid by their
 fierceness, and stood entranced with his lay. Nay, the very trees
 and rocks were sensible to the charm. The former crowded round him and
 the latter relaxed somewhat of their hardness, softened by his notes.
 </p>
 <p>Hymen had been called to bless with his presence the nuptials of
 Orpheus with Eurydice; but though he attended, he brought no happy
 omens with him. His very torch smoked and brought tears into their
 eyes. In coincidence with such prognostics, Eurydice, shortly after
 her marriage, while wandering with the nymphs, her companions, was
 seen by the shepherd Aristaeus, who was struck by her beauty and
 made advances to her. She fled, and in flying trod upon a snake in the
 grass, was bitten in the foot, and died. Orpheus sang his grief to all
 who breathed the upper air, both gods and men, and finding it all
 unavailing resolved to seek his wife in the regions of the dead. He
 descended by a cave situated on the side of the promontory of Taenarus
 and arrived at the Stygian realm. He passed through crowds of ghosts
 and presented himself before the throne of Pluto and Proserpine.
 Accompanying the words with the lyre, he sung, "O deities of the
 under-world, to whom all we who live must come, hear my words, for
 they are true. I come not to spy out the secrets of Tartarus, nor to
 try my strength against the three-headed dog with snaky hair who
 guards the entrance. I come to seek my wife, whose opening years the
 poisonous viper's fang has brought to an untimely end. Love has led me
 here, Love, a god all powerful with us who dwell on the earth, and, if
 old traditions say true, not less so here. I implore you by these
 abodes full of terror, these realms of silence and uncreated things,
 unite again the thread of Eurydice's life. We all are destined to you,
 and sooner or later must pass to your domain. She too, when she
 shall have filled her term of life, will rightly be yours. But till
 then grant her to me, I beseech you. If you deny me, I cannot return
 alone; you shall triumph in the death of us both."
 </p>
 <p>As he sang these tender strains, the very ghosts shed tears.
 Tantalus, in spite of his thirst, stopped for a moment his efforts for
 water, Ixion's wheel stood still, the vulture ceased to tear the
 giant's liver, the daughters of Danaus rested from their task of
 drawing water in a sieve, and Sisyphus sat on his rock to listen. Then
 for the first time, it is said, the cheeks of the Furies were wet with
 tears. Proserpine could not resist, and Pluto himself gave way.
 Eurydice was called. She came from among the new-arrived ghosts,
 limping with her wounded foot. Orpheus was permitted to take her
 away with him on one condition, that he should not turn around to look
 at her till they should have reached the upper air. Under this
 condition they proceeded on their way, he leading, she following,
 through passages dark and steep, in total silence, till they had
 nearly reached the outlet into the cheerful upper world, when Orpheus,
 in a moment of forgetfulness, to assure himself that she was still
 following, cast a glance behind him, when instantly she was borne
 away. Stretching out their arms to embrace each other, they grasped
 only the air! Dying now a second time, she yet cannot reproach her
 husband, for how can she blame his impatience to behold her?
 "Farewell," she said, "a last farewell,"- and was hurried away, so
 fast that the sound hardly reached his ears.
 </p>
 <p>Orpheus endeavoured to follow her, and besought permission to return
 and try once more for her release; but the stern ferryman repulsed him
 and refused passage. Seven days he lingered about the brink, without
 food or sleep; then bitterly accusing of cruelty the powers of Erebus,
 he sang his complaints to the rocks and mountains, melting the
 hearts of tigers and moving the oaks from their stations. He held
 himself aloof from womankind, dwelling constantly on the
 recollection of his sad mischance. The Thracian maidens tried their
 best to captivate him, but he repulsed their advances. They bore
 with him as long as they could; but finding him insensible one day,
 excited by the rites of Bacchus, one of them exclaimed, "See yonder
 our despiser!" and threw at him her javelin. The weapon, as soon as it
 came within the sound of his lyre, fell harmless at his feet. So did
 also the stones that they threw at him. But the women raised a
 scream and drowned the voice of the music, and then the missiles
 reached him and soon were stained with his blood. The maniacs tore him
 limb from limb, and threw his head and his lyre into the river Hebrus,
 down which they floated, murmuring sad music, to which the shores
 responded a plaintive symphony. The Muses gathered up the fragments of
 his body and buried them at Libethra, where the nightingale is said to
 sing over his grave more sweetly than in any other part of Greece. His
 lyre was placed by Jupiter among the stars. His shade passed a
 second time to Tartarus. where he sought out his Eurydice and embraced
 her with eager arms. They roam the happy fields together now,
 sometimes he leading, sometimes she; and Orpheus gazes as much as he
 will upon her, no longer incurring a penalty for a thoughtless glance.
 
 </p>
 <p>The story of Orpheus has furnished Pope with an illustration of
 the power of music, for his "Ode for St. Cecilia's Day." The following
 stanza relates the conclusion of the story:
 
 </p>
         "But soon, too soon the lover turns his eyes;<br>
          Again she falls, again she dies, she dies!<br>
          How wilt thou now the fatal sisters move?<br>
          No crime was thine, if 'tis no crime to love.<br>
              Now under hanging mountains,<br>
              Beside the falls of fountains,<br>
              Or where Hebrus wanders,<br>
              Rolling in meanders,<br>
                  All alone,<br>
                  He makes his moan,<br>
                  And calls her ghost,<br>
                For ever, ever, ever lost!<br>
              Now with furies surrounded,<br>
              Despairing, confounded,<br>
              He trembles, he glows,<br>
              Amidst Rhodope's snows.<br>
          See, wild as the winds o'er the desert he flies;<br>
          Hark! Haemus resounds with the Bacchanals' cries.<br>
                      Ah, see, he dies!<br>
          Yet even in death Eurydice he sung,<br>
          Eurydice still trembled on his tongue:<br>
          Eurydice the woods<br>
          Eurydice the floods<br>
          Eurydice the rocks and hollow mountains rung."<br>
 
 <p>The superior melody of the nightingale's song over the grave of
 Orpheus is alluded to by Southey in his "Thalaba":
 
 </p>
               "Then on his ear what sounds<br>
                  Of harmony arose!<br>
          Far music and the distance-mellowed song<br>
                From bowers of merriment;<br>
                  The waterfall remote;<br>
            The murmuring of the leafy groves;<br>
                  The single nightingale<br>
          Perched in the rosier by, so richly toned,<br>
          That never from that most melodious bird<br>
          Singing a love song to his brooding mate,<br>
            Did Thracian shepherd by the grave<br>
            Of Orpheus hear a sweeter melody,<br>
          Though there the spirit of the sepulchre<br>
            All his own power infuse, to swell<br>
            The incense that he loves."<br>
 
                 ARISTAEUS, THE BEE-KEEPER.<br>
 
 <p>Man avails himself of the instincts of the inferior animals for
 his own advantage. Hence sprang the art of keeping bees. Honey must
 first have been known as a wild product, the bees building their
 structures in hollow trees or holes in the rocks, or any similar
 cavity that chance offered. Thus occasionally the carcass of a dead
 animal would be occupied by the bees for that purpose. It was no doubt
 from some such incident that the superstition arose that the bees were
 engendered by the decaying flesh of the animal; and Virgil, in the
 following story, shows how this supposed fact may be turned to account
 for renewing the swarm when it has been lost by disease or accident.
 </p>
 <p>Aristaeus, who first taught the management of bees, was the son of
 the water-nymph Cyrene. His bees had perished, and he resorted for aid
 to his mother. He stood at the river side and thus addressed her: "O
 mother, the pride of my life is taken from me! I have lost my precious
 bees. My care and skill have availed me nothing, and you, my mother,
 have not warded off from me the blow of misfortune." His mother
 heard these complaints as she sat in her palace at the bottom of the
 river, with her attendant nymphs around her. They were engaged in
 female occupations, spinning and weaving, while one told stories to
 amuse the rest. The sad voice of Aristaeus interrupting their
 occupation, one of them put her head above the water and seeing him,
 returned and gave information to his mother, who ordered that he
 should be brought into her presence. The river at her command opened
 itself and let him pass in, while it stood curled like a mountain on
 either side. He descended to the region where the fountains of the
 great rivers lie; he saw the enormous receptacles of waters and was
 almost deafened with the roar, while he surveyed them hurrying off
 in various directions to water the face of the earth. Arriving at
 his mother's apartment, he was hospitably received by Cyrene and her
 nymphs, who spread their table with the richest dainties. They first
 poured out libations to Neptune, then regaled themselves with the
 feast, and after that Cyrene thus addressed him: "There is an old
 prophet named Proteus, who dwells in the sea and is a favourite of
 Neptune, whose herd of sea-calves he pastures. We nymphs hold him in
 great respect, for he is a learned sage and knows all things, past,
 present, and to come. He can tell you, my son, the cause of the
 mortality among your bees and how you may remedy it. But he will not
 do it voluntarily, however you may entreat him. You must compel him by
 force. If you seize him and chain him, he will answer your questions
 in order to get released, for he cannot by all his arts get away if
 you hold fast the chains. I will carry you to his cave, where he comes
 at noon to take his midday repose. Then you may easily secure him. But
 when he finds himself captured, his resort is to a power he
 possesses of changing himself into various forms. He will become a
 wild boar or a fierce tiger, a scaly dragon or lion with yellow
 mane. Or be will make a noise like the crackling of flames or the rush
 of water, so as to tempt you to let go the chain, when he will make
 his escape. But you have only to keep him fast bound, and at last when
 he finds all his arts unavailing, he will return to his own figure and
 obey your commands." So saying she sprinkled her son with fragrant
 nectar, the beverage of the gods, and immediately an unusual vigour
 filled his frame, and courage his heart, while perfume breathed all
 around him.
 </p>
 <p>The nymph led her son to the prophet's cave and concealed him
 among the recesses of the rocks, while she herself took her place
 behind the clouds. When noon came and the hour when men and herds
 retreat from the glaring sun to indulge in quiet slumber, Proteus
 issued from the water, followed by his herd of sea-calves which spread
 themselves along the shore. He sat on the rock and counted his herd;
 then stretched himself on the floor of the cave and went to sleep.
 Aristaeus hardly allowed him to get fairly asleep before he fixed
 the fetters on him and shouted aloud. Proteus, waking and finding
 himself captured, immediately resorted to his arts, becoming first a
 fire, then a flood, then a horrible wild beast, in rapid succession.
 But finding all would not do, he at last resumed his own form and
 addressed the youth in angry accents: "Who are you, bold youth, who
 thus invade my abode, and what do you want with me?" Aristaeus
 replied, "Proteus, you know already, for it is needless for any one to
 attempt to deceive you. And do you also cease your efforts to elude
 me. I am led hither by divine assistance, to know from you the cause
 of my misfortune and how to remedy it." At these words the prophet,
 fixing on him his grey eyes with a piercing look, thus spoke: "You
 receive the merited reward of your deeds, by which Eurydice met her
 death, for in flying from you she trod upon a serpent, of whose bite
 she died. To avenge her death, the nymphs, her companions, have sent
 this destruction to your bees. You have to appease their anger, and
 thus it must be done: Select four bulls, of perfect form and size, and
 four cows of equal beauty, build four altars to the nymphs, and
 sacrifice the animals, leaving their carcasses in the leafy grove.
 To Orpheus and Eurydice you shall pay such funeral honours as may
 allay their resentment. Returning after nine days, you will examine
 the bodies of the cattle slain and see what will befall." Aristaeus
 faithfully obeyed these directions. He sacrificed the cattle, he
 left their bodies in the grove, he offered funeral honours to the
 shades of Orpheus and Eurydice; then returning on the ninth day he
 examined the bodies of the animals, and, wonderful to relate! a
 swarm of bees had taken possession of one of the carcasses and were
 pursuing their labours there as in a hive.
 
 </p>
 <p>In "The Task," Cowper alludes to the story of Aristaeus, when
 speaking of the ice-palace built by the Empress Anne of Russia. He has
 been describing the fantastic forms which ice assumes in connection
 with waterfalls. etc.:
 
 </p>
           "Less worthy of applause though more admired<br>
            Because a novelty, the work of man,<br>
            Imperial mistress of the fur-clad Russ,<br>
            Thy most magnificent and mighty freak,<br>
            The wonder of the north. No forest fell<br>
            When thou wouldst build, no quarry sent its stores<br>
            T' enrich thy walls; but thou didst hew the floods<br>
            And make thy marble of the glassy wave.<br>
            In such a palace Aristaeus found<br>
            Cyrene, when he bore the plaintive tale<br>
            Of his lost bees to her maternal ear."<br>
 
 <p>Milton also appears to have had Cyrene and her domestic scene in his
 mind when he describes to us Sabrina, the nymph of the river Severn,
 in the Guardian-spirit's song in "Comus":
 
 </p>
                       "Sabrina fair!<br>
                  Listen where thou art sitting<br>
            Under the glassy, cool, translucent wave<br>
                  In twisted braids of lilies knitting<br>
            The loose train of thy amber-drooping hair;<br>
                  Listen for dear honour's sake,<br>
                  Goddess of the silver lake!<br>
                        Listen and save."<br>
 
 <p>The following are other celebrated mythical poets and musicians,
 some of whom were hardly inferior to Orpheus himself:
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">AMPHION.</h3>
 
 
 <p>Amphion was the son of Jupiter and Antiope, queen of Thebes. With
 his twin brother Zethus, he was exposed at birth on Mount Cithaeron,
 where they grew up among the shepherds, not knowing their parentage.
 Mercury gave Amphion a lyre and taught him to play upon it, and his
 brother occupied himself in hunting and tending the flocks.
 Meanwhile Antiope, their mother, who had been treated with great
 cruelty by Lycus, the usurping king of Thebes, and by Dirce, his wife,
 found means to inform her children of their rights and to summon
 them to her assistance. With a band of their fellow-herdsmen they
 attacked and slew Lycus, and tying Dirce by the hair of her head to
 a bull, let him drag her till she was dead.* Amphion, having become
 king of Thebes, fortified the city with a wall. It is said that when
 he played on his lyre the stones moved of their own accord and took
 their places in the wall.
 </p>
 <p>See Tennyson's poem of "Amphion" for an amusing use made of this
 story.
 
 </p>
 <p>* The punishment of Dirce is the subject of a celebrated group of
 statuary now in the Museum at Naples.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">LINUS.</h3>
 
 
 <p>Linus was the instructor of Hercules in music, but having one day
 reproved his pupil rather harshly, he roused the anger of Hercules,
 who struck him with his lyre and killed him.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">THAMYRIS.</h3>
 
 
 <p>An ancient Thracian bard, who in his presumption challenged the
 Muses to a trial of skill, and being overcome in the contest, was
 deprived by them of his sight. Milton alludes to him with other
 blind bards, when speaking of his own blindness, "Paradise Lost," Book
 III. 35.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">MARSYAS.</h3>
 
 
 <p>Minerva invented the flute, and played upon it to the delight of all
 the celestial auditors; but the mischievous urchin Cupid having
 dared to laugh at the queer face which the goddess made while playing,
 Minerva threw the instrument indignantly away, and it fell down to
 earth and was found by Marsyas. He blew upon it, and drew from it such
 ravishing sounds that he was tempted to challenge Apollo himself to
 a musical contest. The god of course triumphed, and punished Marsyas
 by flaying him alive.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">MELAMPUS.</h3>
 
 
 <p>Melampus was the first mortal endowed with prophetic powers.
 Before his house there stood an oak tree containing a serpent's
 nest. The old serpents were killed by the servants, but Melampus
 took care of the young ones and fed them carefully. One day when he
 was asleep under the oak the serpents licked his ears with their
 tongues. On awaking he was astonished to find that he now understood
 the language of birds and creeping things. This knowledge enabled
 him to foretell future events, and he became a renowned soothsayer. At
 one time his enemies took him captive and kept him strictly
 imprisoned. Melampus in the silence of the night heard the woodworms
 in the timbers talking together, and found out by what they said
 that the timbers were nearly eaten through and the roof would soon
 fall in. He told his captors and demanded to be let out, warning
 them also. They took his warning, and thus escaped destruction, and
 regarded Melampus and held him in high honour.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">MUSAEUS.</h3>
 
 
 <p>A semi-mythological personage who was represented by one tradition
 to be the son of Orpheus. He is said to have written sacred poems
 and oracles. Milton couples his name with that of Orpheus in his "Il
 Penseroso":
 
 </p>
               "But O, sad virgin, that thy power<br>
                Might raise Musaeus from his bower,<br>
                Or bid the soul of Orpheus sing<br>
                Such notes as warbled to the string,<br>
                Drew iron tears down Pluto's cheek,<br>
                And made Hell grant what love did seek."<br>
