 <p>Ὀ μὲν γὰρ κάλοσ, ὄσσον ἴδην, πέλεται [ἄγαθοσ]<br>
 ὀ δὲ κἄγαθοσ αὔτικα καὶ κάλοσ ἔσσεται. <font size="1"><a href="xlatall.htm#124">[transcription]</a></font>
 </p>
 <p>He who is fair to look upon is good, and he who is good, will soon be fair also.</p>
 <p>He should be good who is fair of face,<br>
 And he will be fair whose soul has grace.</p>
 <p>Galen, writing about A.D. 160, says: "It is better therefore, knowing as we do that youthful beauty is like the flowers of spring, its allurement lasting but a short time, to agree with the Lesbian poetess, and to believe Solon when he points out the same."</p>
