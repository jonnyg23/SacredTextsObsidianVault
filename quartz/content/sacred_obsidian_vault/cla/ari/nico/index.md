 <a href="nico002.htm">Chapter 2. The science of the good for man is politics</a><br>
 <a href="nico003.htm">Chapter 3. We must not expect more precision than the subject-matter admits. The  student should have reached years of discretion</a><br>
 <a href="nico004.htm">Chapter 4. The good is generally agreed to be happiness, but there are various views as to what happiness is. What is required at the start is an unreasoned  conviction about the facts, such as is produced by a good upbringing</a><br>
 <a href="nico005.htm">Chapter 5. Discussion of the popular views that the good is pleasure, honour, wealth;  a fourth kind of life, that of contemplation, deferred for future discussion</a><br>

 <a href="nico007.htm">Chapter 7. The good must be something final and self-sufficient. Definition of  happiness reached by considering the characteristic function of man</a><br>

 <a href="nico015.htm">Chapter 2. These acts cannot be prescribed exactly, but must avoid excess and defect</a><br>
 <a href="nico016.htm">Chapter 3. Pleasure in doing virtuous acts is a sign that the virtuous disposition has been acquired: a variety of considerations show the essential connexion of moral virtue with pleasure and pain</a><br>
 <a href="nico017.htm">Chapter 4. The actions that produce moral virtue are not good in the same sense as those that flow from it: the latter must fulfil certain conditions not necessary in the case of the arts</a><br>
 <a href="nico018.htm">Chapter 5. Moral virtue's genus: it is a state of character, not a passion nor a faculty</a><br>

 <a href="nico025.htm">Chapter 3. The nature of deliberation and its objects: choice is the deliberate desire of things in our own power</a><br>
 <a href="nico026.htm">Chapter 4. The object of rational wish is the end, i.e. the good or the apparent good</a><br>
 <a href="nico027.htm">Chapter 5. We are responsible for bad as well as for good actions</a><br>
