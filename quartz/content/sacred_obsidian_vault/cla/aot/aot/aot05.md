 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Apollonius</span> of Tyana <a name="fr_1"></a><a href="#fn_1"><font size="1">*</font></a> was the most famous philosopher of the Græco-Roman world of the first century, and devoted the major part of his long life to the purification of the many cults of the Empire and to the instruction of the ministers and priests of its religions. With the exception of the Christ no more interesting personage appears upon the stage of Western history in these early years. Many and various and oft-times mutually contradictory are the opinions which have been held about Apollonius, for the account of his life which has come down to us is in the guise of a romantic story rather than in the form of a plain history. And this is perhaps to some extent to be expected, for Apollonius, besides his public teaching, had a life apart, a life into which even his favourite disciple does</p>

 <p>not enter. He journeys into the most distant lands, and is lost to the world for years; he enters the shrines of the most sacred temples and the inner circles of the most exclusive communities, and what he says or does therein remains a mystery, or serves only as an opportunity for the weaving of some fantastic story by those who did not understand.</p>  
 <p>The following study will be simply an attempt to put before the reader a brief sketch of the problem which the records and traditions of the life of the famous Tyanean present; but before we deal with the Life of Apollonius, written by Flavius Philostratus at the beginning of the third century, we must give the reader a brief account of the references to Apollonius among the classical writers and the Church Fathers, and. a short sketch of the literature of the subject in more recent times, and of the varying fortunes of the war of opinion concerning his life in the last four centuries.</p>  
 <p>First, then, with regard to the references in classical and patristic authors. Lucian, the witty writer of the first half of the second century, makes the subject of one of his satires the pupil of a disciple of Apollonius, of one of those who were acquainted with "all the tragedy" <a name="fr_2"></a><a href="#fn_2"><font size="1">*</font></a> of his life. And Appuleius, a contemporary of Lucian, classes</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Apollonius with Moses and Zoroaster, and other famous Magi of antiquity. <a name="fr_3"></a><a href="#fn_3"><font size="1">*</font></a></p>  
 <p>About the same period, in a work entitled Quæstiones et Responsiones ad Orthodoxos, formerly attributed to Justin Martyr, who flourished in the second quarter of the second century, we find the following interesting statement:</p>  
 <p>"Question 24: If God is the maker and master of creation, how do the consecrated objects <a name="fr_4"></a><a href="#fn_4"><font size="1"></font></a> of Apollonius have power in the [various] orders of that creation? For, <i>as we see</i>, they check the fury of the waves and the power of the winds and the inroads of vermin and attacks of wild beasts." <a name="fr_5"></a><a href="#fn_5"><font size="1"></font></a></p>  
 <p>Dion Cassius in his history, <a name="fr_6"></a><a href="#fn_6"><font size="1">§</font></a> which he wrote <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 211-222, states that Caracalla (Emp. 211-216) honoured the memory of Apollonius with a chapel or monument (<i>heroum</i>).</p>  
 <p>It was just at this time (216) that Philostratus composed his Life of Apollonius, at the request of Domna Julia, Caracalla's mother, and it is with this document principally that we shall have to deal in the sequel.</p>

 <p><a name="page_31"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 31</font></a></p>  
 <p>Lampridius, who flourished about the middle of the third century, further informs us that Alexander Severus (Emp. 222-235) placed the statue of Apollonius in his <i>lararium</i> together with those of Christ, Abraham, and Orpheus. <a name="fr_7"></a><a href="#fn_7"><font size="1">*</font></a></p>  
 <p>Vopiscus, writing in the last decade of the third century, tells us that Aurelian (Emp. 270-275) vowed a temple to Apollonius, of whom he had seen a vision when besieging Tyana. Vopiscus speaks of the Tyanean as "a sage of the most wide-spread renown and authority, an ancient philosopher, and a true friend of the Gods," nay, as a manifestation of deity. "For what among men," exclaims the historian, "was more holy, what more worthy of reverence, what more venerable, what more god-like than he? He, it was, who gave life to the dead. He, it was, who did and said so many things beyond the power of men." <a name="fr_8"></a><a href="#fn_8"><font size="1"></font></a> So enthusiastic is Vopiscus about Apollonius, that he promises, if he lives, to write a short account of his life in Latin, so that his deeds and words may be on the tongue of all, for as yet the only accounts are in Greek. <a name="fr_9"></a><a href="#fn_9"><font size="1"></font></a> Vopiscus, however, did not fulfil his promise, but</p>

 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_32"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 32</font></a></p>  
 <p>we learn that about this date both Soterichus <a name="fr_10"></a><a href="#fn_10"><font size="1">*</font></a> and Nichomachus wrote Lives of our philosopher, and shortly afterwards Tascius Victorianus, working on the papers of Nichomachus, <a name="fr_11"></a><a href="#fn_11"><font size="1"></font></a> also composed a Life. None of these Lives, however, have reached us.</p>  
 <p>It was just at this period also, namely, in the last years of the third century and the first years of the fourth, that Porphyry and Iamblichus composed their treatises on Pythagoras and his school; both mention Apollonius as one of their authorities, and it is probable that the first 30 sections of Iamblichus are taken from Apollonius. <a name="fr_12"></a><a href="#fn_12"><font size="1"></font></a></p>  
 <p>We now come to an incident which hurled the character of Apollonius into the arena of Christian polemics, where it has been tossed about until the present day. Hierocles, successively governor of Palmyra, Bithynia, and Alexandria, and a philosopher, about the year 305 wrote a criticism on the claims of the Christians, in two books,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_33"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 33</font></a></p>  
 <p>called A Truthful Address to the Christians, or more shortly The Truth-lover. He seems to have based himself for the most part on the previous works of Celsus and Porphyry, <a name="fr_13"></a><a href="#fn_13"><font size="1">*</font></a> but introduced a new subject of controversy by opposing the wonderful works of Apollonius to the claims of the Christians to exclusive right in "miracles" as proof of the divinity of their Master. In this part of his treatise Hierocles used Philostratus Life of Apollonius.</p>  
 <p>To this pertinent criticism of Hierocles Eusebius of Cæsarea immediately replied in a treatise still extant, entitled Contra Hieroclem. <a name="fr_14"></a><a href="#fn_14"><font size="1"></font></a> Eusebius admits that Apollonius was a wise and virtuous man, but denies that there is sufficient proof that the wonderful things ascribed to him ever took place; and even if they did take place, they were the work of "dæmons," and not of God. The treatise of Eusebius is interesting; he severely scrutinises the statements in Philostratus, and shows himself possessed of a first rate critical</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_34"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 34</font></a></p>  
 <p>faculty. Had he only used the same faculty on the documents of the Church, of which he was the first historian, posterity would have owed him an eternal debt of gratitude. But Eusebius, like so many other apologists, could only see one side; justice, when anything touching Christianity was called into question, was a stranger to his mind, and he would have considered it blasphemy to use his critical faculty on the documents which relate the "miracles" of Jesus. Still the problem of "miracle" was the same, as Hierocles pointed out, and remains the same to this day.</p>  
 <p>After the controversy reincarnated again in the sixteenth century, and when the hypothesis of the "Devil" as the prime-mover in all "miracles" but those of the Church lost its hold with the progress of scientific thought, the nature of the wonders related in the Life of Apollonius was still so great a difficulty that it gave rise to a new hypothesis of plagiarism. The life of Apollonius was a Pagan plagiarism of the life of Jesus. But Eusebius and the Fathers who followed him had no suspicion of this; they lived in times when such an assertion could have been easily refuted. There is not a word in Philostratus to show he had any acquaintance with the life of Jesus, and fascinating as Baur's "tendency-writing" theory is to many, we can only say that</p>  
 <p><a name="page_35"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 35</font></a></p>  
 <p>as a plagiarist of the Gospel story Philostratus is a conspicuous failure. Philostratus writes the history of a good and wise man, a man with a mission of teaching, clothed in the wonder stories preserved in the memory and embellished by the imagination of fond posterity, but not the drama of incarnate Deity as the fulfilment of world-prophecy.</p>  
 <p>Lactantius, writing about 315, also attacked the treatise of Hierocles, who seems to have put forward some very pertinent criticisms; for the Church Father says that he enumerates so many of their Christian inner teachings (<i>intima</i>) that sometimes he would seem to have at one time undergone the same training (<i>disciplina</i>). But it is in vain, says Lactantius, that Hierocles endeavours to show that Apollonius performed similar or even greater deeds than Jesus, for Christians do not believe that Christ is God because he did wonderful things, but because all the things wrought in him were those which were announced by the prophets. <a name="fr_15"></a><a href="#fn_15"><font size="1">*</font></a> And in taking this ground Lactantius saw far more clearly than Eusebius the weakness of the proof from "miracle."</p>  
 <p>Arnobius, the teacher of Lactantius, however, writing at the end of the third century, before</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_36"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 36</font></a></p>  
 <p>the controversy, in referring to Apollonius simply classes him among Magi, such as Zoroaster and others mentioned in the passage of Appuleius to which we have already referred. <a name="fr_16"></a><a href="#fn_16"><font size="1">*</font></a></p>  
 <p>But even after the controversy there is a wide difference of opinion among the Fathers, for although at the end of the fourth century John Chrysostom with great bitterness calls Apollonius a deceiver and evil-doer, and declares that the whole of the incidents in his life are unqualified fiction, <a name="fr_17"></a><a href="#fn_17"><font size="1"></font></a> Jerome, on the contrary, at the very same date, takes almost a favourable view, for, after perusing Philostratus, he writes that Apollonius found everywhere something to learn and something whereby he might become a better man. <a name="fr_18"></a><a href="#fn_18"><font size="1"></font></a></p>  
 <p>At the beginning of the fifth century also Augustine, while ridiculing any attempt at comparison between Apollonius and Jesus, says that the character of the Tyanean was "far superior" to that ascribed to Jove, in respect of virtue. <a name="fr_19"></a><a href="#fn_19"><font size="1">§</font></a></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_37"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 37</font></a></p>  
 <p>About the same date also we find Isidorus of Pelusium, who died in 450, bluntly denying that there is any truth in the claim made by "certain," whom he does not further specify, that Apollonius of Tyana "consecrated many spots in many parts of the world for the safety of the inhabitants." <a name="fr_20"></a><a href="#fn_20"><font size="1">*</font></a> It is instructive to compare the denial of Isidorus with the passage we have already quoted from Pseudo-Justin. The writer of Questions and Answers to the Orthodox in the second century could not dispose of the question by a blunt denial; he had to admit it and argue the case on other groundsnamely, the agency of the Devil. Nor can the argument of the Fathers, that Apollonius used magic to bring about his results, while the untaught Christians could perform healing wonders by a single word, <a name="fr_21"></a><a href="#fn_21"><font size="1"></font></a> be accepted as valid by the unprejudiced critic, for there is no evidence to support the contention that Apollonius employed such methods for his wonder-workings; on the contrary, both Apollonius himself and his biographer Philostratus strenuously repudiate the charge of magic brought against him.</p>  
 <p>On the other hand, a few years later, Sidonius Apollinaris, Bishop of Claremont, speaks in the</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_38"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 38</font></a></p>  
 <p>highest terms of Apollonius. Sidonius translated the Life of Apollonius into Latin for Leon, the councillor of King Euric, and in writing to his friend he says: "Read the life of a man who (religion apart) resembles you in many things; a man sought out by the rich, yet who never sought for riches; who loved wisdom and despised gold; a man frugal in the midst of feastings, clad in linen in the midst of those clothed in purple, austere in the midst of luxury. . . . In fine, to speak plainly, perchance no historian will find in ancient times a philosopher whose life is equal to that of Apollonius." <a name="fr_22"></a><a href="#fn_22"><font size="1">*</font></a></p>  
 <p>Thus we see that even among the Church Fathers opinions were divided; while among the philosophers themselves the praise of Apollonius was unstinted.</p>  
 <p>For Ammianus Marcellinus, "the last subject of Rome who composed a profane history in the Latin language," and the friend of Julian the philosopher-emperor, refers to the Tyanean as "that most renowned philosopher"; <a name="fr_23"></a><a href="#fn_23"><font size="1"></font></a> while a few years later Eunapius, the pupil of Chrysanthius, one of the teachers of Julian, writing in the last years of the fourth century, says that</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_39"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 39</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Apollonius was more than a philosopher; he was "a middle term, as it were, between gods and men." <a name="fr_24"></a><a href="#fn_24"><font size="1">*</font></a> Not only was Apollonius an adherent of the Pythagorean philosophy, but "he fully exemplified the more divine and practical side in it." In fact Philostratus should have called his biography "The Sojourning of a God among Men." <a name="fr_25"></a><a href="#fn_25"><font size="1"></font></a> This seemingly wildly exaggerated estimate may perhaps receive explanation in the fact that Eunapius belonged to a school which knew the nature of the attainments ascribed to Apollonius.</p>  
 <p>Indeed, "as late as the fifth century we find one Volusian, a proconsul of Africa, descended from an old Roman family and still strongly attached to the religion of his ancestors, almost worshipping Apollonius of Tyana as a supernatural being." <a name="fr_26"></a><a href="#fn_26"><font size="1"></font></a></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_40"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 40</font></a></p>  
 <p>Even after the downfall of philosophy we find Cassiodorus, who spent the last years of his long life in a monastery, speaking of Apollonius as the "renowned philosopher." <a name="fr_27"></a><a href="#fn_27"><font size="1">*</font></a> So also among Byzantine writers, the monk George Syncellus, in the eighth century, refers several times to our philosopher, and not only without the slightest adverse criticism, but he declares that he was the first and most remarkable of all the illustrious people who appeared under the Empire. <a name="fr_28"></a><a href="#fn_28"><font size="1"></font></a> Tzetzes also, the critic and grammarian, calls Apollonius "all-wise and a fore-knower of all things." <a name="fr_29"></a><a href="#fn_29"><font size="1"></font></a></p>  
 <p>And though the monk Xiphilinus, in the eleventh century, in a note to his abridgment of the history of Dion Cassius, calls Apollonius a clever juggler and magician, <a name="fr_30"></a><a href="#fn_30"><font size="1">§</font></a> nevertheless Cedrenus in the same century bestows on Apollonius the not uncomplimentary title of an "adept Pythagorean philosopher," <a name="fr_31"></a><a href="#fn_31"><font size="1">**</font></a> and relates several instances of the efficacy of his powers</p>

 <p>in Byzantium. In fact, if we can believe Nicetas, as late as the thirteenth century there were at Byzantium certain bronze doors, formerly consecrated by Apollonius, which had to be melted down because they had become an object of superstition even for the Christians themselves. <a name="fr_32"></a><a href="#fn_32"><font size="1">*</font></a></p>  
 <p>Had the work of Philostratus disappeared with the rest of the Lives, the above would be all that we should have known about Apollonius. <a name="fr_33"></a><a href="#fn_33"><font size="1"></font></a> Little enough, it is true, concerning so distinguished a character, yet ample enough to show that, with the exception of theological prejudice, the suffrages of antiquity were all on the side of our philosopher.</p>
