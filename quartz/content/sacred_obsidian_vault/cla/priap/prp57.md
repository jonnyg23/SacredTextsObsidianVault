 <h3 align="CENTER">Priapus</h3>
 <p>Cornix et caries vetusque bustum,<br>
 turba putida facta saeculorum,<br>
 quae forsan potuisset esse nutrix<br>
 Tithoni Priamique Nestorisque,<br>
 illis ni pueris anus fuisset,<br>
 ne desit sibi, me rogat, fututor.<br>
 quid si nunc roget, ut puella fiat?<br>
 si nummos tamen haec habet, puella est.</p>
 <p>A chough, a caries, an eld-worn grave,<br>
 By lapse of crowding centuries rotten grown,<br>
 Who as a wetnurse haply may have fed<br>
 Tithonus, Priam, Nestor, and perchance<br>
 When they were little lads was agèd crone,<br>
 Sues me for swiver she may never lack!<br>
 How if she pray me to be girl again?<br>
 Yet, if she's moneyed, she's again a girl.</p>
 <p>An old crow, a thing of decay, a very sepulchre, grown rotten through the lapse of generations, who perchance might have been the wet-nurse of Tithonus, of Priam, and of Nestor, or who was an old woman maybe when they were boys, beseeches me that a futterer may not be wanting to her. How if she were now to pray that she may become a girl again? Nevertheless if she hath- money, she is a girl.[1]</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[1. Suggesting she may obtain a lover if she will pay for him. Martial writes,<br>
 'Lesbia swears that she has never been futtered gratis. It is true: for when she<br>
 wants to futter, she is wont to pay.' And,</p>
 <p>Wouldst thou be wimbled <i>gratis</i> when thou art<br>
 A wrinkled wretch deformed in every part?<br>
 O 'tis a thing more than ridiculous:<br>
 To take a man's full sum, and not pay Use!]</p>
