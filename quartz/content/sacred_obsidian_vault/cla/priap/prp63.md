 <h3 align="CENTER">Priapus</h3>
 <p>Parum est quod hic ut fiximus semel sedem,<br>
 agente terra per caniculam rimas<br>
 siticulosam sustinemus aestatem?<br>
 parum, quod hiemis perfluunt sinus imbres<br>
 et in capillos grandines cadunt nostros<br>
 rigetque dura barba vincta crystallo?<br>
 parum, quod acta sub laboribus luce<br>
 parem diebus pervigil traho noctem?<br>
 huc adde, quod me fuste de rudi vilem<br>
 manus sine arte rusticae dolaverunt,<br>
 interque cunctos ultimum deos numen<br>
 cucurbitarum ligneus vocor custos.<br>
 accedit istis impudentiae signum,<br>
 libidinoso tenta pyramis nervo.<br>
 ad hanc puella - paene nomen adieci -<br>
 solet venire cum suo fututore,<br>
 quae tot figuris, quot Philaenis enarrat,<br>
 non inventis, pruriosa discedit.</p>
 <p>'Tis not enough, my friends, I set my seat<br>
 Where earth gapes chinky under Canicule,<br>
 Ever enduring thirsty summer's drought.<br>
 'Tis not enough the showers flow down my breast<br>
 And beat the hail-storms on my naked hair,<br>
 With beard fast frozen, rigid by the rime.<br>
 'Tis not enough that days in labour spent<br>
 Sleepless I lengthen through the nights as long.<br>
 Add that a godhead terrible of staff<br>
 Hewed me the rustic's rude unartful hand<br>
 And made me vilest of all deities,<br>
 Invoked as wooden guardian of the gourds.<br>
 And more, for shameless note to me was 'signed<br>
 With lustful nerve a pyramid distent,<br>
 Whereto a damsel (whom well nigh I'd named)<br>
 Is with her fornicator wont to come<br>
 And save in every mode Philaenis tells<br>
 Futtered, in furious lust her way she wends.</p>
 <p>'Tis not enough, O friends, that I have fixed my abode here, where the earth gapes into chinks through the heat of the dog days, and that I daily endure the summer's drought; 'tis not enough that the rains flow down my bosom, that hail-storms beat amongst my bared locks, and that my beard frozen together is stiffened by the ice: 'tis too little that having spent the day in labour, I protract it, sleepless, through a night equally long. Add to this, that the unskilled hands of a rustic have chopped me, the awe-inspiring god with a cudgel, and that, amongst all the gods the lowest deity, I am called the wooden guardian of gourds. A pyramid [the virile member] stretched forth with libidinous vigour joins to these the symbol of shamelessness. Hither a damsel (I had almost added her name) is wont to come with her futterer: who if as many forms as Philaenis narrates she does not experience, she departs raging with unsated lust.</p>
