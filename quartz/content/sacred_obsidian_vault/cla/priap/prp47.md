 <p>Quicumque vestrum, qui venitis ad cenam,<br>
 libare nullos sustinet mihi versus,<br>
 illius uxor aut amica rivalem<br>
 lasciviendo languidum, precor, reddat,<br>
 et ipse longa nocte dormiat solus<br>
 libidinosis incitatus erucis.</p>
 <p>Who of you people here shall come to sup<br>
 Yet bring no verses suited to my taste;<br>
 I pray his wife or punk, hot-wantoning,<br>
 Reduce his rival to most languid state;<br>
 While he, all lonely through the livelong night,<br>
 Lie, by the lustful rockets sore disturbed.</p>
 <p>Whichever of you, who, coming to my banquet, abstains from inscribing to me any verses, I pray that his wife or mistress may make languid his rival with lascivious sporting, whilst he himself sleeps alone through the weary night, excited by lustful rockets.[1]</p>
