 <h3 align="CENTER">Priapus</h3>
 <p>Uvis aridior puella passis,<br>
 buxo pallidior novaque cera,<br>
 collatas sibi quae suisque membris<br>
 formicas facit altiles videri,<br>
 cuius viscera non aperta Tuscus<br>
 per pellem poterit videre haruspex,<br>
 quae suco caret ut putrisque pumex,<br>
 nemo viderit hanc ut exspuentem,<br>
 quam pro sanguine pulverem scobemque<br>
 in venis medici putant habere,<br>
 ad me nocte solet venire et affert<br>
 pallorem maciemque larualem.<br>
 ductor ferreus insularis aeque et<br>
 lanternae videor fricare cornu.</p>
 <p>A damsel drier than the raisin'd grape,<br>
 Warmer than boxwood or than virgin wax,<br>
 Who pismires clustering on her every limb<br>
 Maketh a bulky-corpulent folk appear;<br>
 One whose unopened bowels through her skin<br>
 The Tuscan wizard can at will prospect;<br>
 One who like rotten pounce so lacking juice<br>
 None ever saw her with a slavering lip;<br>
 One whom for blood her arteries within<br>
 To have sand or sawdust differing leeches deem--<br>
 Such one to visit me anights is wont<br>
 Bringing with ghostly leanness ghastly hue;<br>
 Whist I (like island iron-forger) seem<br>
 To rub and rasp me on a lanthorn's horn</p>
 <p>Girl, more meagre than dried grapes,[1] more dusky-white than boxwood or unsullied wax; who makes the ants congregated on her body and members seem corpulent; whose bowels the Etruscan soothsayer could without opening see through the skin; who, like pumice, has no sap, insomuch as no one has seen her sputter; who, physicians think, has sand for blood, and in her veins sawdust--[this girl] is wont to come to me in the night, and approaches me, wan, attenuate and ghostlike, whilst I, as an insular iron-worker scrapes,[2] seem to be rubbing in the horn of a lantern.[3]</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[1. This is reminiscent of an epigram by Catullus against Furius, in which he describes him as having a body more dried than horn by extreme poverty; adding, 'Sweat, saliva, mucus and nasal snivelling, all these are absent from thee. Add to this cleanliness the still greater cleanliness that thy buttocks are purer than a salt-cellar. Thou does not cack ten times in the whole of the year, and then it is harder than a bean or than pebbles, so that if thou rubbest and crumblest it in thy hands thou canst never dirty a finger.'</p>
 <p>2. Islands abound in metals, hence convicts in ancient times were transported to work on them.</p>
 <p>3. Here used in a jocular comparison of the girl's parts with the horn of a lantern for hardness and dryness in coition.]</p>
