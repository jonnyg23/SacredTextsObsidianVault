 <h3 align="CENTER">Priapus</h3>
 <p>Commoditas haec est in nostro maxima pene,<br>
    laxa quod esse mihi femina nulla potest.</p>
 <p>Aye in this prickle of ours the bonniest boon to be found is,<br>
 Loose for my daily use never a woman can be.</p>
 <p>The greatest advantage in my penis is this, that no woman can be [too] roomy[1] for me.</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[1. A popular theme of the poets. From Scioppius, 'However loose her coynte may be I will zealously fill it.' And from Martial against Lydia--</p>
 <p>'Me roomy Lydia's private parts surpass<br>
 The lusty dray horse' elephantine arse;<br>
 Wide as the schoolboy's ringing iron hoop;<br>
 Vast as the ring the agile riders stoop<br>
 And leap through neatly, touching not the side,<br>
 As round and round the dusty course they ride;<br>
 Capacious as some old and well-worn shoe,<br>
 That's trudged the muddy streets since first 'twas new;<br>
 Stretched like the net the crafty fowler holds;<br>
 And drapery as a curtain's heavy folds;<br>
 Loose as the bracelet gemmed with green and scarlet,<br>
 That mocks the arm of some consumptive harlot;<br>
 Slack as a feather bed without the feathers;<br>
 And baggy as some ostler's well-used leathers;<br>
 Relaxed and hanging like the skinny coat<br>
 That shields the vulture's foul and flabby throat.<br>
 'Tis said, while bathing once we trod love's path,<br>
 I know not, but I seemed to fuck the bath.</p>
 <p>A somewhat similar person was the provident wife in the poem of "The Sutler', who when her husband was robbed of his horses and waggon and all his goods by a party of the enemy's forces, consoled him as follows--</p>
 <p>'No matter,' she said, and look'd with a smile,<br>
 'I did the damn'd party, in some sort, beguile;'<br>
 Then drew out a purse twice as big as your fist,<br>
 'Tho' they search'd me,' said she, 'this treasure they missed;<br>
 Then prithee, be cheerful.' This gave him new life,<br>
 He wept, and he laugh'd, and he ogl'd his wife,<br>
 And leering upon her, said, 'Tell me, my dear,<br>
 Where was it you hid the purse I see here?'<br>
 She smil'd on her spouse, then laugh'd in his face,<br>
 'I hid it,' said she, 'in a certain place,<br>
 With which you're acquainted! He said, 'My dear life,<br>
 I see you're a careful and provident wife;<br>
 You've done very well, but you'd had more to brag on,<br>
 If you there had conceal'd the horses and waggon.']</p>
