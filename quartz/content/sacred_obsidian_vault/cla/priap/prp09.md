 <h3 align="CENTER">Priapus</h3>
 <p>Insulsissima quid puella rides?<br>
 non me Praxiteles Scopasve fecit,<br>
 nec sum Phidiaca manu politus;<br>
 sed lignum rude vilicus dolavit,<br>
 et dixit mihi: 'tu Priapus esto'.<br>
 spectas me tamen et subinde rides?<br>
 nimirum tibi salsa res videtur<br>
 adstans inguinibus columna nostris.</p>
 <p>Why laugh such laughter, O most silly maid?<br>
 My form Praxiteles nor Scopas hewed;<br>
 To me no Phidian handwork finish gave;<br>
 But me a bailiff hacked from shapeless log,<br>
 And quoth my maker, 'Thou Priapus be!'<br>
 Yet on me gazing forthright gigglest thou<br>
 And holdest funny matter to deride<br>
 The pillar perking from the groin of me.</p>
 <p>Why, most foolish girl, do you laugh? Neither Praxiteles[1] nor Scopas[2] has given me shape, nor have I been perfected by the hand of Phidias;[3] but a bailiff carved me from a shapeless log, and said to me, 'You are Priapus!'[4] Yet you gaze at me, and laugh repeatedly. Doubtless it seems to you a droll thing--the 'column' standing upright from my groin.</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[1. Praxiteles, according to Pliny, lived in the time of Pompeius: his statue of Venus was very famous.</p>
 <p>2. Scopas was a celebrated sculptor in marble and carved in relief on the Mausoleum.</p>
 <p>3. Phidias was a renowned ivory sculptor.</p>
 <p>4. The statue was so badly carved that the sculptor had to explain what his work was intended to represent.]</p>
