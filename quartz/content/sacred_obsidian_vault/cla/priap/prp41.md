 <p>Quisquis venerit huc, poeta fiat<br>
 et versus mihi dedicet iocosos.<br>
 qui non fecerit, inter eruditos<br>
 ficosissimus ambulet poetas.</p>
 <p>Whoso comes hither shall a bard become<br>
 And to me dedicate facetious verse;<br>
 But who thiswise doth not, 'mid learnèd poets<br>
 Shall pace with fundament fulfilled of 'figs'.</p>
 <p>Whoever comes hither let him become a poet and dedicate to me jocose verses. He who does not, shall, teeming with piles,[1] walk amongst learned poets.</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[1. Piles were a frequent result of sodomy. The word <i>ficus</i> means primarily a fig, and piles were so called from their resemblance in shape to that fruit.]</p>
