 <h3>THE FAILURE OF NERVE</h3>
 
 
 <p>Any one who turns from the great writers of classical Athens, say
 Sophocles or Aristotle, to those of the Christian era must be conscious
 of a great difference in tone. There is a change in the whole relation
 of the writer to the world about him. The new quality is not
 specifically Christian: it is just as marked in the Gnostics and
 Mithras-worshippers as in the Gospels and the Apocalypse, in Julian and
 Plotinus as in Gregory and Jerome. It is hard to describe. It is a rise
 of asceticism, of mysticism, in a sense, of pessimism; a loss of
 self-confidence, of hope in this life and of faith in normal human
 effort; a despair of patient inquiry, a cry for infallible revelation;
 an indifference to the welfare of the state, a conversion of the soul to
 God. It is an atmosphere in which the aim of the good man is not so much
 to live justly, to help the society to which he belongs and enjoy the
 esteem of his fellow creatures; but rather, by means of a burning faith,
 by contempt for the world and its standards, by ecstasy, suffering, and
 martyrdom, to be granted pardon for his unspeakable unworthiness, his
 immeasurable sins. There is an intensifying of certain spiritual
 emotions; an increase of sensitiveness, a failure of nerve.</p>
 
 <p>Now this antithesis is often exaggerated by the admirers of one side or
 the other. A hundred people write as if Sophocles had no mysticism and
 practically speaking no conscience. Half a dozen retort as if <a name="page_124"><font size="1" color="green">p. 124</font></a> St. Paul
 had no public spirit and no common sense. I have protested often against
 this exaggeration; but, stated reasonably, as a change of proportion and
 not a creation of new hearts, the antithesis is certainly based on fact.
 The historical reasons for it are suggested above, in the first of these
 essays.</p>
 
 <p>My description of this complicated change is, of course, inadequate, but
 not, I hope, one-sided. I do not depreciate the religions that followed
 on this movement by describing the movement itself as a 'failure of
 nerve'. Mankind has not yet decided which of two opposite methods leads
 to the fuller and deeper knowledge of the world: the patient and
 sympathetic study of the good citizen who lives in it, or the ecstatic
 vision of the saint who rejects it. But probably most Christians are
 inclined to believe that without some failure and sense of failure,
 without a contrite heart and conviction of sin, man can hardly attain
 the religious life. I can imagine an historian of this temper believing
 that the period we are about to discuss was a necessary softening of
 human pride, a <i>Praeparatio Evangelica</i>.<a name="an_fr_124_1"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_124_1">124_1</a></p>
 
 <p><a name="page_125"><font size="1" color="green">p. 125</font></a> </p><p>I am concerned in this paper with the lower country lying between two
 great ranges. The one range is Greek Philosophy, culminating in Plato,
 Aristotle, the Porch, and the Garden; the other is Christianity,
 culminating in St. Paul and his successors. The one is the work of
 Hellas, using some few foreign elements; the second is the work of
 Hellenistic culture on a Hebrew stock. The books of Christianity are
 Greek, the philosophical background is Hellenistic, the result of the
 interplay, in the free atmosphere of Greek philosophy, of religious
 ideas derived from Egypt, Anatolia, Syria, and Babylon. The preaching is
 carried on in Greek among the Greek-speaking workmen of the great
 manufacturing and commercial cities. The first preachers are Jews: the
 central scene is set in Jerusalem. I wish in this essay to indicate how
 a period of religious history, which seems broken, is really continuous,
 and to trace the lie of the main valleys which lead from the one range
 to the other, through a large and imperfectly explored territory.</p>
 
 <p>The territory in question is the so-called Hellenistic Age, the period
 during which the Schools of Greece were 'hellenizing' the world. It is a
 time of great <a name="page_126"><font size="1" color="green">p. 126</font></a> enlightenment, of vigorous propaganda, of high importance
 to history. It is a time full of great names: in one school of
 philosophy alone we have Zeno, Cleanthes, Chrysippus, Panaetius,
 Posidonius. Yet, curiously enough, it is represented in our tradition by
 something very like a mere void. There are practically no complete books
 preserved, only fragments and indirect quotations. Consequently in the
 search for information about this age we must throw our nets wide.
 Beside books and inscriptions of the Hellenistic period proper I have
 drawn on Cicero, Pliny, Seneca, and the like for evidence about their
 teachers and masters. I have used many Christian and Gnostic documents
 and works like the Corpus of Hermetic writings and the Mithras Liturgy.
 Among modern writers I must acknowledge a special debt to the researches
 of Dieterich, Cumont, Bousset, Wendland, and Reitzenstein.</p>
 
 <hr style="width: 45%;">
 
 <p>The Hellenistic Age seems at first sight to have entered on an
 inheritance such as our speculative Anarchists sometimes long for, a
 <i>tabula rasa</i>, on which a new and highly gifted generation of thinkers
 might write clean and certain the book of their discoveries about
 life—what Herodotus would call their '<i>Historiê</i>'. For, as we have seen
 in the last essay, it is clear that by the time of Plato the traditional
 religion of the Greek states was, if taken at its face value, a bankrupt
 concern. There was hardly one aspect in which it could bear criticism;
 and in the kind of test that chiefly matters, the satisfaction of men's
 ethical requirements and aspirations, it was if anything weaker than
 elsewhere. Now a religious <a name="page_127"><font size="1" color="green">p. 127</font></a> belief that is scientifically preposterous
 may still have a long and comfortable life before it. Any worshipper can
 suspend the scientific part of his mind while worshipping. But a
 religious belief that is morally contemptible is in serious danger,
 because when the religious emotions surge up the moral emotions are not
 far away. And the clash cannot be hidden.</p>
 
 <p>This collapse of the traditional religion of Greece might not have
 mattered so much if the form of Greek social life had remained. If a
 good Greek had his Polis, he had an adequate substitute in most respects
 for any mythological gods. But the Polis too, as we have seen in the
 last essay, fell with the rise of Macedon. It fell, perhaps, not from
 any special spiritual fault of its own; it had few faults except its
 fatal narrowness; but simply because there now existed another social
 whole, which, whether higher or lower in civilization, was at any rate
 utterly superior in brute force and in money. Devotion to the Polis lost
 its reality when the Polis, with all that it represented of rights and
 laws and ideals of Life, lay at the mercy of a military despot, who
 might, of course, be a hero, but might equally well be a vulgar sot or a
 corrupt adventurer.</p>
 
 <p>What the succeeding ages built upon the ruins of the Polis is not our
 immediate concern. In the realm of thought, on the whole, the Polis
 triumphed. Aristotle based his social theory on the Polis, not the
 nation. Dicaearchus, Didymus, and Posidonius followed him, and we still
 use his language. Rome herself was a Polis, as well as an Empire. And
 Professor Haverfield has pointed out that a City has more chance of
 taking in the whole world to its freedoms and privileges <a name="page_128"><font size="1" color="green">p. 128</font></a> than a Nation
 has of making men of alien birth its compatriots. A Jew of Tarsus could
 easily be granted the civic rights of Rome: he could never have been
 made an Italian or a Frenchman. The Stoic ideal of the World as 'one
 great City of Gods and Men' has not been surpassed by any ideal based on
 the Nation.</p>
 
 <p>What we have to consider is the general trend of religious thought from,
 say, the Peripatetics to the Gnostics. It is a fairly clear history. A
 soil once teeming with wild weeds was to all appearance swept bare and
 made ready for new sowing: skilled gardeners chose carefully the best of
 herbs and plants and tended the garden sedulously. But the bounds of the
 garden kept spreading all the while into strange untended ground, and
 even within the original walls the weeding had been hasty and
 incomplete. At the end of a few generations all was a wilderness of
 weeds again, weeds rank and luxuriant and sometimes extremely beautiful,
 with a half-strangled garden flower or two gleaming here and there in
 the tangle of them. Does that comparison seem disrespectful to religion?
 Is philosophy all flowers and traditional belief all weeds? Well, think
 what a weed is. It is only a name for all the natural wild vegetation
 which the earth sends up of herself, which lives and will live without
 the conscious labour of man. The flowers are what we keep alive with
 difficulty; the weeds are what conquer us.</p>
 
 <p>It has been well observed by Zeller that the great weakness of all
 ancient thought, not excepting Socratic thought, was that instead of
 appealing to objective experiment it appealed to some subjective <a name="page_129"><font size="1" color="green">p. 129</font></a> sense
 of fitness. There were exceptions, of course: Democritus, Eratosthenes,
 Hippocrates, and to a great extent Aristotle. But in general there was a
 strong tendency to follow Plato in supposing that people could really
 solve questions by an appeal to their inner consciousness. One result of
 this, no doubt, was a tendency to lay too much stress on mere agreement.
 It is obvious, when one thinks about it, that quite often a large number
 of people who know nothing about a subject will all agree and all be
 wrong. Yet we find the most radical of ancient philosophers
 unconsciously dominated by the argument <i>ex consensu gentium</i>. It is
 hard to find two more uncompromising thinkers than Zeno and Epicurus.
 Yet both of them, when they are almost free from the popular
 superstitions, when they have constructed complete systems which, if not
 absolutely logic-proof, are calculated at least to keep out the weather
 for a century or so, open curious side-doors at the last moment and let
 in all the gods of mythology.<a name="an_fr_129_1"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_129_1">129_1</a> True, they are admitted as
 suspicious characters, and under promise of good behaviour. Epicurus
 explains that they do not and cannot do anything whatever to anybody;
 Zeno explains that they are not anthropomorphic, and are only symbols or
 emanations or subordinates of the all-ruling Unity; both parties get rid
 of the myths. But the two great reformers have admitted a dangerous
 principle. The general consensus of humanity, they say, shows that there
 are gods, and gods which in mind, if not also in visual <a name="page_130"><font size="1" color="green">p. 130</font></a> appearance,
 resemble man. Epicurus succeeded in barring the door, and admitted
 nothing more. But the Stoics presently found themselves admitting or
 insisting that the same consensus proved the existence of daemons, of
 witchcraft, of divination, and when they combined with the Platonic
 school, of more dangerous elements still.</p>
 
 <p>I take the Stoics and Epicureans as the two most radical schools. On the
 whole both of them fought steadily and strongly against the growth of
 superstition, or, if you like to put it in other language, against the
 dumb demands of man's infra-rational nature. The glory of the Stoics is
 to have built up a religion of extraordinary nobleness; the glory of the
 Epicureans is to have upheld an ideal of sanity and humanity stark
 upright amid a reeling world, and, like the old Spartans, never to have
 yielded one inch of ground to the common foe.</p>
 
 <p>The great thing to remember is that the mind of man cannot be
 enlightened permanently by merely teaching him to reject some particular
 set of superstitions. There is an infinite supply of other superstitions
 always at hand; and the mind that desires such things—that is, the mind
 that has not trained itself to the hard discipline of reasonableness and
 honesty, will, as soon as its devils are cast out, proceed to fill
 itself with their relations.</p>
 
 <hr style="width: 45%;">
 
 <p>Let us first consider the result of the mere denial of the Olympian
 religion. The essential postulate of that religion was that the world is
 governed by a number of definite personal gods, possessed of a human
 sense of justice and fairness and capable of being <a name="page_131"><font size="1" color="green">p. 131</font></a> influenced by normal
 human motives. In general, they helped the good and punished the bad,
 though doubtless they tended too much to regard as good those who paid
 them proper attention and as bad those who did not.</p>
 
 <p>Speaking broadly, what was left when this conception proved inadequate?
 If it was not these personal gods who made things happen, what was it?
 If the Tower of Siloam was not deliberately thrown down by the gods so
 as to kill and hurt a carefully collected number of wicked people, while
 letting the good escape, what was the explanation of its falling? The
 answer is obvious, but it can be put in two ways. You can either say:
 'It was just chance that the Tower fell at that particular moment when
 So-and-so was under it.' Or you can say, with rather more reflection but
 not any more common sense: 'It fell because of a definite chain of
 causes, a certain degree of progressive decay in the building, a certain
 definite pressure, &amp;c. It was bound to fall.'</p>
 
 <p>There is no real difference in these statements, at least in the meaning
 of those who ordinarily utter them. Both are compatible with a
 reasonable and scientific view of the world. But in the Hellenistic Age,
 when Greek thought was spreading rapidly and superficially over vast
 semi-barbarous populations whose minds were not ripe for it, both views
 turned back instinctively into a theology as personal as that of the
 Olympians. It was not, of course, Zeus or Apollo who willed this; every
 one knew so much: it happened by Chance. That is, Chance or Fortune
 willed it. And <ins class="greek" title="Tychê">Τύχη</ins> became a goddess like the rest. The great
 catastrophes, the great transformations of the <a name="page_132"><font size="1" color="green">p. 132</font></a> mediterranean world
 which marked the Hellenistic period, had a strong influence here. If
 Alexander and his generals had practised some severely orthodox
 Macedonian religion, it would have been easy to see that the Gods of
 Macedon were the real rulers of the world. But they most markedly did
 not. They accepted hospitably all the religions that crossed their path.
 Some power or other was disturbing the world, that was clear. It was not
 exactly the work of man, because sometimes the good were exalted,
 sometimes the bad; there was no consistent purpose in the story. It was
 just Fortune. Happy is the man who knows how to placate Fortune and make
 her smile upon him!</p>
 
 <p>It is worth remembering that the best seed-ground for superstition is a
 society in which the fortunes of men seem to bear practically no
 relation to their merits and efforts. A stable and well-governed society
 does tend, speaking roughly, to ensure that the Virtuous and Industrious
 Apprentice shall succeed in life, while the Wicked and Idle Apprentice
 fails. And in such a society people tend to lay stress on the reasonable
 or visible chains of causation. But in a country suffering from
 earthquakes or pestilences, in a court governed by the whim of a despot,
 in a district which is habitually the seat of a war between alien
 armies, the ordinary virtues of diligence, honesty, and kindliness seem
 to be of little avail. The only way to escape destruction is to win the
 favour of the prevailing powers, take the side of the strongest invader,
 flatter the despot, placate the Fate or Fortune or angry god that is
 sending the earthquake or the pestilence. The Hellenistic period pretty
 certainly <a name="page_133"><font size="1" color="green">p. 133</font></a> falls in some degree under all of these categories. And one
 result is the sudden and enormous spread of the worship of Fortune. Of
 course, there was always a protest. There is the famous</p>
 
 <div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
 <span class="i0"><i>Nullum numen habes si sit prudentia: nos te,</i><br></span>
 <span class="i0"><i>Nos facimus, Fortuna, deam</i>,<br></span>
 </div></div>
 
 <p>taken by Juvenal from the Greek. There are many unguarded phrases and at
 least three corrections in Polybius.<a name="an_fr_133_1"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_133_1">133_1</a> Most interesting of all
 perhaps, there is the first oration of Plutarch on the Fortune of
 Alexander.<a name="an_fr_133_2"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_133_2">133_2</a> A sentence in Pliny's <i>Natural History</i>, ii. 22, seems
 to go back to Hellenistic sources:</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_134"><font size="1" color="green">p. 134</font></a> </p><div class="blockquot"><p>'Throughout the whole world, at every place and hour, by
 every voice Fortune alone is invoked and her name spoken: she
 is the one defendant, the one culprit, the one thought in
 men's minds, the one object of praise, the one cause. She is
 worshipped with insults, counted as fickle and often as blind,
 wandering, inconsistent, elusive, changeful, and friend of the
 unworthy. . . . We are so much at the mercy of chance that Chance
 is our god.'</p></div>
 
 <p>The word used is first <i>Fortuna</i> and then <i>Sors</i>. This shows how little
 real difference there is between the two apparently contradictory
 conceptions.—'Chance would have it so.' 'It was fated to be.' The sting
 of both phrases—their pleasant bitterness when played with, their
 quality of poison when believed—lies in their denial of the value of
 human endeavour.</p>
 
 <p>Yet on the whole, as one might expect, the believers in Destiny are a
 more respectable congregation than the worshippers of Chance. It
 requires a certain amount of thoughtfulness to rise to the conception
 that nothing really happens without a cause. It is the beginning,
 perhaps, of science. Ionic philosophers of the fifth century had laid
 stress on the <ins class="greek" title="Anankê physios">Ἀνάγκη φύσιος</ins>,<a name="an_fr_134_1"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_134_1">134_1</a> what we should call the Chain of
 causes in Nature. After the rise of Stoicism Fate becomes something less
 physical, more related to conscious purpose. It is not <i>Anankê</i> but
 <i>Heimarmenê</i>. Heimarmenê, in the striking simile of Zeno,<a name="an_fr_134_2"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_134_2">134_2</a> is like
 a fine thread running through the whole of existence—the world, we must
 remember, was to the Stoics a live <a name="page_135"><font size="1" color="green">p. 135</font></a> thing—like that invisible thread of
 life which, in heredity, passes on from generation to generation of
 living species and keeps the type alive; it runs causing, causing for
 ever, both the infinitesimal and the infinite. It is the <ins class="greek" title="Logos tou
 Kosmou">Λόγος τοῦ Κόσμου</ins>,<a name="an_fr_135_1"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_135_1">135_1</a> the <ins class="greek" title="Nous Dios">Νοῦς Διός</ins>, the Reason of the World or the mind of
 Zeus, rather difficult to distinguish from the Pronoia or Providence
 which is the work of God and indeed the very essence of God. Thus it is
 not really an external and alien force. For the human soul itself is a
 fragment or effluence of the divine, and this Law of God is also the law
 of man's own Phusis. As long as you act in accordance with your true
 self you are complying with that divine <ins class="greek" title="Heimarmenê">Εἱμαρμένη</ins> or <ins class="greek" title="Pronoia">Πρόνοια</ins>, whose
 service is perfect freedom. Only when you are false to your own nature
 and become a rebel against the kingdom of God which is within you, are
 you dragged perforce behind the chariot-wheels. The doctrine is implied
 in Cleanthes' celebrated Hymn to Destiny and is explained clearly by
 Plotinus.<a name="an_fr_135_2"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_135_2">135_2</a></p>
 
 <p>That is a noble conception. But the vulgar of course can turn Kismet
 into a stupid idol, as easily as they can Fortune. And Epicurus may have
 had some excuse for exclaiming that he would sooner be a slave to the
 old gods of the vulgar, than to the Destiny of the philosophers.<a name="an_fr_135_3"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_135_3">135_3</a></p>
 
 <p>So much for the result in superstitious minds of the denial, or rather
 the removal, of the Olympian Gods. It landed men in the worship of
 Fortune or of Fate.</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_136"><font size="1" color="green">p. 136</font></a> </p><p>Next, let us consider what happened when, instead of merely rejecting
 the Gods <i>en masse</i>, people tried carefully to collect what remained of
 religion after the Olympian system fell.</p>
 
 <p>Aristotle himself gives us a fairly clear answer. He held that the
 origins of man's idea (<ins class="greek" title="ennoia">ἔννοια</ins>) of the Divine were twofold,<a name="an_fr_136_1"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_136_1">136_1</a> the
 phenomena of the sky and the phenomena of the human soul. It is very
 much what Kant found two thousand years later. The spectacle of the vast
 and ordered movements of the heavenly bodies are compared by him in a
 famous fragment with the marching forth of Homer's armies before Troy.
 Behind such various order and strength there must surely be a conscious
 mind capable</p>
 
 <div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

 </div></div>
 
 <p>It is only a step from this to regarding the sun, moon, and stars as
 themselves divine, and it is a step which both Plato and Aristotle,
 following Pythagoras and followed by the Stoics, take with confidence.
 Chrysippus gives practically the same list of gods: 'the Sun, Moon, and
 Stars; and Law: and men who have become Gods.'<a name="an_fr_136_2"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_136_2">136_2</a> Both the wandering
 stars and the fixed stars are 'animate beings, divine and eternal',
 self-acting subordinate gods. As to the divinity of the soul or the mind
 of man, the earlier generations are shy about it. But in the later
 Stoics it is itself a portion of the divine life. It shows this
 ordinarily by its power of reason, and more conspicuously by becoming
 <ins class="greek" title="entheos">ἔνθεος</ins>, or 'filled with God', in its exalted <a name="page_137"><font size="1" color="green">p. 137</font></a> moments of prevision,
 ecstasy, and prophetic dreams. If reason itself is divine, there is
 something else in the soul which is even higher than reason or at least
 more surprisingly divine.</p>
 
 <p>Let us follow the history of both these remaining substitutes for the
 Olympian gods.</p>
 
 <p>First for the Heavenly bodies. If they are to be made divine, we can
 hardly stop there. The Earth is also a divine being. Old tradition has
 always said so, and Plato has repeated it. And if Earth is divine, so
 surely are the other elements, the <i>Stoicheia</i>, Water, Air, and above
 all, Fire. For the Gods themselves are said by Plato to be made of fire,
 and the Stars visibly are so. Though perhaps the heavenly Fire is really
 not our Fire at all, but a <ins class="greek" title="pempton sôma">πέμπτον σῶμα</ins>, a 'Fifth Body', seeing that
 it seems not to burn nor the Stars to be consumed.</p>
 
 <p>This is persuasive enough and philosophic; but whither has it led us?
 Back to the Olympians, or rather behind the Olympians; as St. Paul puts
 it (Gal. iv. 9), to 'the beggarly elements'. The old Korê, or Earth
 Maiden and Mother, seems to have held her own unshaken by the changes of
 time all over the Aegean area. She is there in prehistoric Crete with
 her two lions; with the same lions orientalized in Olympia and Ephesus;
 in Sparta with her great marsh birds; in Boeotia with her horse. She
 runs riot in a number of the Gnostic systems both pre-Christian and
 post-Christian. She forms a divine triad with the Father and the Son:
 that is ancient and natural. But she also becomes the Divine Wisdom,
 Sophia, the Divine Truth, Aletheia, the Holy Breath or Spirit, the
 Pneuma. Since the word <a name="page_138"><font size="1" color="green">p. 138</font></a> for 'spirit' is neuter in Greek and masculine in
 Latin, this last is rather a surprise. It is explained when we remember
 that in Hebrew the word for Spirit, 'Ruah', is mostly feminine. In the
 meantime let us notice one curious development in the life of this
 goddess. In the old religion of Greece and Western Asia, she begins as a
 Maiden, then in fullness of time becomes a mother. There is evidence
 also for a third stage, the widowhood of withering autumn.<a name="an_fr_138_1"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_138_1">138_1</a> To the
 classical Greek this motherhood was quite as it should be, a due
 fulfilment of normal functions. But to the Gnostic and his kind it
 connoted a 'fall', a passage from the glory of Virginity to a state of
 Sin.<a name="an_fr_138_2"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_138_2">138_2</a> The Korê becomes a fallen Virgin, sometimes a temptress or
 even a female devil; sometimes she has to be saved by her Son the
 Redeemer.<a name="an_fr_138_3"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_138_3">138_3</a> As far as I have observed, she loses most of her
 earthly agricultural quality, though as Selene or even Helen she keeps
 up her affinity with the Moon.</p>
 
 <p>Almost all the writers of the Hellenistic Age agree in regarding the
 Sun, Moon, and Stars as gods. The rationalists Hecataeus and Euhemerus,
 before going on to their deified men, always start with the heavenly
 bodies. When Plutarch explains in his beautiful and kindly way that all
 religions are really attempts towards the same goal, he clinches his
 argument by <a name="page_139"><font size="1" color="green">p. 139</font></a> observing that we all see the same Sun and Moon though we
 call them by different names in all languages.<a name="an_fr_139_1"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_139_1">139_1</a> But the belief
 does not seem to have had much religious intensity in it, until it was
 reinforced by two alien influences.</p>
 
 <p>First, we have the ancient worship of the Sun, implicit, if not
 explicit, in a great part of the oldest Greek rituals, and then
 idealized by Plato in the <i>Republic</i>, where the Sun is the author of all
 light and life in the material world, as the Idea of Good is in the
 ideal world. This worship came gradually into contact with the
 traditional and definite Sun-worship of Persia. The final combination
 took place curiously late. It was the Roman conquests of Cilicia,
 Cappadocia, Commagene, and Armenia that gave the decisive moment.<a name="an_fr_139_2"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_139_2">139_2</a>
 To men who had wearied of the myths of the poets, who could draw no more
 inspiration from their Apollo and Hyperion, but still had the habits and
 the craving left by their old Gods, a fresh breath of reality came with
 the entrance of <ins class="greek" title="Hêlios anikêtos Mithras">Ἥλιος ἀνίκητος Μίθρας</ins>, 'Mithras, the Unconquered
 Sun'. But long before the triumph of Mithraism as the military religion
 of the Roman frontier, Greek literature is permeated with a kind of
 intense language about the Sun, which seems derived from Plato.<a name="an_fr_139_3"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_139_3">139_3</a>
 In later times, in the fourth century <span class="smcap">a. d.</span> for instance, it has
 absorbed some more full-blooded and less critical element as well.</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_140"><font size="1" color="green">p. 140</font></a> </p><p>Secondly, all the seven planets. These had a curious history. The
 planets were of course divine and living bodies, so much Plato gave us.
 Then come arguments and questions scattered through the Stoic and
 eclectic literature. Is it the planet itself that is divine, or is the
 planet under the guidance of a divine spirit? The latter seems to win
 the day. Anthropomorphism has stolen back upon us: we can use the old
 language and speak simply of the planet Mercury as <ins class="greek" title="Hêrmou astêr">Ἑρμοῦ ἀστήρ</ins>. It is
 the star of Hermes, and Hermes is the spirit who guides it.<a name="an_fr_140_1"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_140_1">140_1</a> Even
 Plato in his old age had much to say about the souls of the seven
 planets. Further, each planet has its sphere. The Earth is in the
 centre, then comes the sphere of the Moon, then that of the Sun, and so
 on through a range of seven spheres. If all things are full of gods, as
 the wise ancients have said, what about those parts of the sphere in
 which the shining planet for the moment is not? Are they without god?
 Obviously not. The whole sphere is filled with innumerable spirits
 everywhere. It is all Hermes, all Aphrodite. (We are more familiar with
 the Latin names, Mercury and Venus.) But one part only is visible. The
 voice of one school, as usual, is raised in opposition. One veteran had
 seen clearly from the beginning whither all this sort of thing was sure
 to lead. 'Epicurus approves none of these things.'<a name="an_fr_140_2"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_140_2">140_2</a> It was no
 <a name="page_141"><font size="1" color="green">p. 141</font></a> good his having destroyed the old traditional superstition, if people
 by deifying the stars were to fill the sky with seven times seven as
 many objects of worship as had been there before. He allows no
 <i>Schwärmerei</i> about the stars. They are <i>not</i> divine animate beings, or
 guided by Gods. Why cannot the astrologers leave God in peace? When
 their orbits are irregular it is <i>not</i> because they are looking for
 food. They are just conglomerations of ordinary atoms of air or fire—it
 does not matter which. They are not even very large—only about as large
 as they look, or perhaps smaller, since most fires tend to look bigger
 at a distance. They are not at all certainly everlasting. It is quite
 likely that the sun comes to an end every day, and a new one rises in
 the morning. All kinds of explanations are possible, and none certain.
 <ins class="greek" title="Monon ho mythos apestô.">Μόνον ὁ μῦθος ἀπέστω.</ins> In any case, as you value your life and your
 reason, do not begin making myths about them!</p>
 
 <p>On other lines came what might have been the effective protest of real
 Science, when Aristarchus of Samos (250 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>) argued that the earth was
 not really the centre of the universe, but revolved round the Sun. But
 his hypothesis did not account for the phenomena as completely as the
 current theory with its 'Epicycles'; his fellow astronomers were against
 him; Cleanthes the Stoic denounced him for 'disturbing the Hearth of the
 Universe', and his heresy made little headway.<a name="an_fr_141_1"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_141_1">141_1</a></p>
 
 <p>The planets in their seven spheres surrounding the earth continued to be
 objects of adoration. They had their special gods or guiding spirits
 assigned them. Their ordered movements through space, it was held,
 <a name="page_142"><font size="1" color="green">p. 142</font></a> produce a vast and eternal harmony. It is beautiful beyond all earthly
 music, this Music of the Spheres, beyond all human dreams of what music
 might be. The only pity is that—except for a few individuals in
 trances—nobody has ever heard it. Circumstances seem always to be
 unfavourable. It may be that we are too far off, though, considering the
 vastness of the orchestra, this seems improbable. More likely we are
 merely deaf to it because it never stops and we have been in the middle
 of it since we first drew breath.<a name="an_fr_142_1"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_142_1">142_1</a></p>
 
 <p>The planets also become Elements in the Kosmos, <i>Stoicheia</i>. It is
 significant that in Hellenistic theology the word Stoicheion, Element,
 gets to mean a Daemon—as Megathos, Greatness, means an Angel.<a name="an_fr_142_2"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_142_2">142_2</a>
 But behold a mystery! The word <i>Stoicheia</i>, 'elementa', had long been
 used for the Greek A B C, and in particular for the seven vowels <ins class="greek" title="a">α</ins> <ins class="greek" title="e">ε</ins> <ins class="greek" title="ê">η</ins>
 <ins class="greek" title="i">ι</ins> <ins class="greek" title="o">ο</ins> <ins class="greek" title="u">υ</ins> <ins class="greek" title="ô">ω</ins>. That is no chance, no mere coincidence. The vowels are the
 mystic signs of the Planets; they have control over the planets. Hence
 strange prayers and magic formulae innumerable.</p>
 
 <p>Even the way of reckoning time changed under the influence of the
 Planets. Instead of the old division of the month into three periods of
 nine days, we find gradually establishing itself the week of seven days
 with each day named after its planet, Sun, Moon, Ares, Hermes, Zeus,
 Aphrodite, Kronos. The history of the Planet week is given by Dio
 Cassius, xxxvii. 18, <a name="page_143"><font size="1" color="green">p. 143</font></a> in his account of the Jewish campaign of Pompeius.
 But it was not the Jewish week. The Jews scorned such idolatrous and
 polytheistic proceedings. It was the old week of Babylon, the original
 home of astronomy and planet-worship.<a name="an_fr_143_1"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_143_1">143_1</a></p>
 
 <p>For here again a great foreign religion came like water in the desert to
 minds reluctantly and superficially enlightened, but secretly longing
 for the old terrors and raptures from which they had been set free. Even
 in the old days Aeschylus had called the planets 'bright potentates,
 shining in the fire of heaven', and Euripides had spoken of the 'shaft
 hurled from a star'.<a name="an_fr_143_2"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_143_2">143_2</a> But we are told that the first teaching of
 astrology in Hellenic lands was in the time of Alexander, when Bêrôssos
 the Chaldaean set up a school in Cos and, according to Seneca, <i>Belum
 interpretatus est</i>. This must mean that he translated into Greek the
 '<i>Eye of Bel</i>', a treatise in seventy tablets found in the library of
 Assur-bani-pal (686-626 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>) but composed for Sargon I in the third
 millennium <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> Even the philosopher Theophrastus is reported by
 Proclus<a name="an_fr_143_3"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_143_3">143_3</a> as saying that 'the most extraordinary thing of his age
 was the lore of the Chaldaeans, who foretold not only events of public
 interest but even the lives and deaths of individuals'. One wonders
 slightly whether Theophrastus spoke with as much implicit faith as
 Proclus suggests. But the chief account is given by Diodorus, ii. 30
 (perhaps from Hecataeus).</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_144"><font size="1" color="green">p. 144</font></a> </p><div class="blockquot"><p>'Other nations despise the philosophy of Greece. It is so
 recent and so constantly changing. They have traditions which
 come from vast antiquity and never change. Notably the
 Chaldaeans have collected observations of the Stars through
 long ages, and teach how every event in the heavens has its
 meaning, as part of the eternal scheme of divine forethought.
 Especially the seven Wanderers, or Planets, are called by them
 Hermêneis, Interpreters: and among them the Interpreter in
 chief is Saturn. Their work is to interpret beforehand <ins class="greek" title="tên
 tôn theôn ennoian">τὴν τῶν θεῶν ἔννοιαν</ins>, the thought that is in the mind of the
 Gods. By their risings and settings, and by the colours they
 assume, the Chaldaeans predict great winds and storms and
 waves of excessive heat, comets, and earthquakes, and in
 general all changes fraught with weal or woe not only to
 nations and regions of the world, but to kings and to ordinary
 men and women. Beneath the Seven are thirty Gods of Counsel,
 half below and half above the Earth; every ten days a
 Messenger or Angel star passes from above below and another
 from below above. Above these gods are twelve Masters, who are
 the twelve signs of the Zodiac; and the planets pass through
 all the Houses of these twelve in turn. The Chaldaeans have
 made prophecies for various kings, such as Alexander who
 conquered Darius, and Antigonus and Seleucus Nikator, and have
 always been right. And private persons who have consulted them
 consider their wisdom as marvellous and above human power.'</p></div>
 
 <p>Astrology fell upon the Hellenistic mind as a new disease falls upon
 some remote island people. The tomb of Ozymandias, as described by
 Diodorus (i. 49, 5), was covered with astrological symbols, and that of
 Antiochus I, which has been discovered in Commagene, is of the same
 character. It was natural for monarchs to believe that the stars watched
 <a name="page_145"><font size="1" color="green">p. 145</font></a> over them. But every one was ready to receive the germ. The Epicureans,
 of course, held out, and so did Panaetius, the coolest head among the
 Stoics. But the Stoics as a whole gave way. They formed with good reason
 the leading school of philosophy, and it would have been a service to
 mankind if they had resisted. But they were already committed to a
 belief in the deity of the stars and to the doctrine of Heimarmenê, or
 Destiny. They believed in the pervading Pronoia,<a name="an_fr_145_1"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_145_1">145_1</a> or Forethought,
 of the divine mind, and in the <ins class="greek" title="Sympatheia tôn holôn">Συμπάθεια τῶν ὅλων</ins>—the Sympathy of
 all Creation,<a name="an_fr_145_2"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_145_2">145_2</a> whereby whatever happens to any one part, however
 remote or insignificant, affects all the rest. It seemed only a natural
 and beautiful illustration of this Sympathy that the movements of the
 Stars should be bound up with the sufferings of man. They also appealed
 to the general belief in prophecy and divination.<a name="an_fr_145_3"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_145_3">145_3</a> If a prophet
 can foretell that such and such an event will happen, then it is
 obviously fated to happen. Foreknowledge implies Predestination. This
 belief in prophecy was, in reality, a sort of appeal to fact and to
 common sense. People could produce then, as they can now, a large number
 of striking cases of second sight, presentiment, clairvoyance, actual
 prophecy and the like;<a name="an_fr_145_4"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_145_4">145_4</a> and it was more difficult then to test
 them.</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_146"><font size="1" color="green">p. 146</font></a> </p><p>The argument involved Stoicism with some questionable allies.
 Epicureans and sceptics of the Academy might well mock at the sight of a
 great man like Chrysippus or Posidonius resting an important part of his
 religion on the undetected frauds of a shady Levantine 'medium'. Still
 the Stoics could not but welcome the arrival of a system of prophecy and
 predestination which, however the incredulous might rail at it,
 possessed at least great antiquity and great stores of learning, which
 was respectable, recondite, and in a way sublime.</p>
 
 <p>In all the religious systems of later antiquity, if I mistake not, the
 Seven Planets play some lordly or terrifying part. The great Mithras
 Liturgy, unearthed by Dieterich from a magical papyrus in Paris,<a name="an_fr_146_1"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_146_1">146_1</a>
 repeatedly confronts the worshipper with the seven vowels as names of
 'the Seven Deathless Kosmokratores', or Lords of the Universe, and
 seems, under their influence, to go off into its 'Seven Maidens with
 heads of serpents, in white raiment', and its divers other Sevens. The
 various Hermetic and Mithraic communities, the Naassenes described by
 Hippolytus,<a name="an_fr_146_2"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_146_2">146_2</a> and other Gnostic bodies, authors like Macrobius and
 even Cicero in his <i>Somnium Scipionis</i>, are full of the influence of the
 seven planets and of the longing to escape beyond them. For by some
 simple psychological law the stars which have inexorably pronounced our
 fate, and decreed, or at least registered <a name="page_147"><font size="1" color="green">p. 147</font></a> the decree, that in spite of
 all striving we must needs tread their prescribed path; still more
 perhaps, the Stars who know in the midst of our laughter how that
 laughter will end, become inevitably powers of evil rather than good,
 beings malignant as well as pitiless, making life a vain thing. And
 Saturn, the chief of them, becomes the most malignant. To some of the
 Gnostics he becomes Jaldabaoth, the Lion-headed God, the evil
 Jehovah.<a name="an_fr_147_1"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_147_1">147_1</a> The religion of later antiquity is overpoweringly
 absorbed in plans of escape from the prison of the seven planets.</p>
 
 <p>In author after author, in one community after another, the subject
 recurs. And on the whole there is the same answer. Here on the earth we
 are the sport of Fate; nay, on the earth itself we are worse off still.
 We are beneath the Moon, and beneath the Moon there is not only Fate but
 something more unworthy and equally malignant, Chance—to say nothing of
 damp and the ills of earth and bad daemons. Above the Moon there is no
 chance, only Necessity: there is the will of the other six
 Kosmokratores, Rulers of the Universe. But above them all there is an
 Eighth region—they call it simply the Ogdoas—the home of the ultimate
 God,<a name="an_fr_147_2"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_147_2">147_2</a> whatever He is named, whose being was before the Kosmos. In
 this Sphere is true Being and Freedom. And more than freedom, there is
 the ultimate Union with God. For that spark of divine life which is
 man's soul is not merely, as some have said, an <ins class="greek" title="aporroia tôn astrôn">ἀπόρροια τῶν ἄστρων</ins>,
 an effluence of the stars: it comes direct from the first and ultimate
 <a name="page_148"><font size="1" color="green">p. 148</font></a> God, the Alpha and Omega, who is beyond the Planets. Though the
 Kosmokratores cast us to and fro like their slaves or dead chattels, in
 soul at least we are of equal birth with them. The Mithraic votary, when
 their wrathful and tremendous faces break in upon his vision, answers
 them unterrified: <ins class="greek" title="egô eimi symplanos hymin astêr">ἐγώ εἰμι σύμπλανος ὑμῖν ἀστήρ</ins>, 'I am your fellow
 wanderer, your fellow Star.' The Orphic carried to the grave on his
 golden scroll the same boast: first, 'I am the child of Earth and of the
 starry Heaven'; then later, 'I too am become God'.<a name="an_fr_148_1"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_148_1">148_1</a> The Gnostic
 writings consist largely of charms to be uttered by the Soul to each of
 the Planets in turn, as it pursues its perilous path past all of them to
 its ultimate home.</p>
 
 <p>That journey awaits us after death; but in the meantime? In the meantime
 there are initiations, sacraments, mystic ways of communion with God. To
 see God face to face is, to the ordinary unprepared man, sheer death.
 But to see Him after due purification, to be led to Him along the true
 Way by an initiating Priest, is the ultimate blessing of human life. It
 is to die and be born again. There were regular official initiations. We
 have one in the Mithras-Liturgy, more than one in the Corpus Hermeticum.
 Apuleius<a name="an_fr_148_2"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_148_2">148_2</a> tells us at some length, though in guarded language, how
 he was initiated to Isis and became 'her image'. After much fasting,
 clad in holy garments and led by the High Priest, he crossed the
 threshold of Death and passed through all the Elements. The Sun shone
 upon him at midnight, and he saw the Gods of Heaven and of Hades. In the
 morning he was clad <a name="page_149"><font size="1" color="green">p. 149</font></a> in the Robe of Heaven, set up on a pedestal in
 front of the Goddess and worshipped by the congregation as a God. He had
 been made one with Osiris or Horus or whatever name it pleased that
 Sun-God to be called. Apuleius does not reveal it.</p>
 
 <p>There were also, of course, the irregular personal initiations and
 visions of god vouchsafed to persons of special prophetic powers. St.
 Paul, we may remember, knew personally a man who had actually been
 snatched up into the Third Heaven, and another who was similarly rapt
 into Paradise, where he heard unspeakable words;<a name="an_fr_149_1"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_149_1">149_1</a> whether in the
 body or not, the apostle leaves undecided. He himself on the road to
 Damascus had seen the Christ in glory, not after the flesh. The
 philosopher Plotinus, so his disciple tells us, was united with God in
 trance four times in five years.<a name="an_fr_149_2"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_149_2">149_2</a></p>
 
 <p>We seem to have travelled far from the simplicity <a name="page_150"><font size="1" color="green">p. 150</font></a> of early Greek
 religion. Yet, apart always from Plotinus, who is singularly aloof, most
 of the movement has been a reaction under Oriental and barbarous
 influences towards the most primitive pre-Hellenic cults. The union of
 man with God came regularly through <i>Ekstasis</i>—the soul must get clear
 of its body—and <i>Enthousiasmos</i>—the God must enter and dwell inside
 the worshipper. But the means to this union, while sometimes allegorized
 and spiritualized to the last degree, are sometimes of the most
 primitive sort. The vagaries of religious emotion are apt to reach very
 low as well as very high in the scale of human nature. Certainly the
 primitive Thracian savages, who drank themselves mad with the hot blood
 of their God-beast, would have been quite at home in some of these
 rituals, though in others they would have been put off with some
 substitute for the actual blood. The primitive priestesses who waited in
 a bridal chamber for the Divine Bridegroom, even the Cretan Kourêtes
 with their Zeus Kourês<a name="an_fr_150_1"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_150_1">150_1</a> and those strange hierophants of the
 'Men's House' whose initiations are written on the rocks of Thera, would
 have found rites very like their own reblossoming on earth after the
 fall of Hellenism. 'Prepare thyself as a bride to receive her
 bridegroom,' says Markos the Gnostic,<a name="an_fr_150_2"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_150_2">150_2</a> 'that thou mayst be what I
 am and I what thou art.' 'I in thee, and thou in me!' is the ecstatic
 cry of one of the Hermes liturgies. Before that the prayer has been
 'Enter into me as a babe into the womb of a woman'.<a name="an_fr_150_3"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_150_3">150_3</a></p>
 
 <p><a name="page_151"><font size="1" color="green">p. 151</font></a> </p><p>In almost all the liturgies that I have read need is felt for a
 mediator between the seeker after God and his goal. Mithras himself saw
 a Mesîtês, a Mediator, between Ormuzd and Ahriman, but the ordinary
 mediator is more like an interpreter or an adept with inner knowledge
 which he reveals to the outsider. The circumstances out of which these
 systems grew have left their mark on the new gods themselves. As usual,
 the social structure of the worshippers is reflected in their objects of
 worship. When the Chaldaeans came to Cos, when the Thracians in the
 Piraeus set up their national worship of Bendis, when the Egyptians in
 the same port founded their society for the Egyptian ritual of Isis,
 when the Jews at Assuan in the fifth century <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> established their own
 temple, in each case there would come proselytes to whom the truth must
 be explained and interpreted, sometimes perhaps softened. And in each
 case there is behind the particular priest or initiator there present
 some greater authority in the land he comes from. Behind any explanation
 that can be made in the Piraeus, there is a deeper and higher
 explanation known only to the great master in Jerusalem, in Egypt, in
 Babylon, or perhaps in some unexplored and ever-receding region of the
 east. This series of revelations, one behind the other, is a
 characteristic of all these mixed Graeco-Oriental religions.</p>
 
 <p>Most of the Hermetic treatises are put in the form of initiations or
 lessons revealed by a 'father' to a 'son', by Ptah to Hermes, by Hermes
 to Thoth or Asclepios, and by one of them to us. It was an ancient
 formula, a natural vehicle for traditional wisdom in Egypt, where the
 young priest became regularly the 'son' of the old priest. It is a form
 <a name="page_152"><font size="1" color="green">p. 152</font></a> that we find in Greece itself as early as Euripides, whose Melanippe
 says of her cosmological doctrines,</p>
 
 <div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
 <span class="i0">'It is not my word but my Mother's word'.<a name="an_fr_152_1"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_152_1">152_1</a><br></span>
 </div></div>
 
 <p>It was doubtless the language of the old Medicine-Man to his disciple.
 In one fine liturgy Thoth wrestles with Hermes in agony of spirit, till
 Hermes is forced to reveal to him the path to union with God which he
 himself has trodden before. At the end of the Mithras liturgy the
 devotee who has passed through the mystic ordeals and seen his god face
 to face, is told: 'After this you can show the way to others.'</p>
 
 <p>But this leads us to the second great division of our subject. We turn
 from the phenomena of the sky to those of the soul.</p>
 
 <hr style="width: 45%;">
 
 <p>If what I have written elsewhere is right, one of the greatest works of
 the Hellenic spirit, and especially of fifth-century Athens, was to
 insist on what seems to us such a commonplace truism, the difference
 between Man and God. Sophrosynê in religion was the message of the
 classical age. But the ages before and after had no belief in such a
 lesson. The old Medicine-Man was perhaps himself the first <i>Theos</i>. At
 any rate the primeval kings and queens were treated as divine.<a name="an_fr_152_2"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_152_2">152_2</a>
 Just for a few great generations, it would seem, humanity rose to a
 sufficient height of self-criticism <a name="page_153"><font size="1" color="green">p. 153</font></a> and self-restraint to reject these
 dreams of self-abasement or megalomania. But the effort was too great
 for the average world; and in a later age nearly all the kings and
 rulers—all people in fact who can command an adequate number of
 flatterers—become divine beings again. Let us consider how it came
 about.</p>
 
 <p>First there was the explicit recognition by the soberest philosophers of
 the divine element in man's soul.<a name="an_fr_153_1"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_153_1">153_1</a> Aristotle himself built an
 altar to Plato. He did nothing superstitious; he did not call Plato a
 god, but we can see from his beautiful elegy to Eudemus, that he
 naturally and easily used language of worship which would seem a little
 strange to us. It is the same emotion—a noble and just emotion on the
 whole—which led the philosophic schools to treat their founders as
 'heroes', and which has peopled most of Europe and Asia with the
 memories and the worship of saints. But we should remember that only a
 rare mind will make its divine man of such material as Plato. The common
 way to dazzle men's eyes is a more brutal and obvious one.</p>
 
 <p>To people who were at all accustomed to the conception of a God-Man it
 was difficult not to feel that the conception was realized in Alexander.
 His tremendous power, his brilliant personality, his achievements
 beggaring the fables of the poets, put people in the right mind for
 worship. Then came the fact that the kings whom he conquered were, as a
 matter of fact, mostly regarded by their subjects as <a name="page_154"><font size="1" color="green">p. 154</font></a> divine
 beings.<a name="an_fr_154_1"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_154_1">154_1</a> It was easy, it was almost inevitable, for those who
 worshipped the 'God'<a name="an_fr_154_2"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_154_2">154_2</a> Darius to feel that it was no man but a
 greater god who had overthrown Darius. The incense which had been burned
 before those conquered gods was naturally offered to their conqueror. He
 did not refuse it. It was not good policy to do so, and
 self-depreciation is not apt to be one of the weaknesses of the born
 ruler.<a name="an_fr_154_3"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_154_3">154_3</a> But besides all this, if you are to judge a God by his
 fruits, what God could produce better credentials? Men had often seen
 Zeus defied with impunity; they had seen faithful servants of Apollo
 come to bad ends. But those who defied Alexander, however great they
 might be, always rued their defiance, and those who were faithful to him
 always received their reward. With his successors the worship became
 more official. Seleucus, Ptolemaeus, Antigonus, Demetrius, all in
 different degrees and different styles are deified by the acclamations
 of adoring subjects. Ptolemy Philadelphus seems to have been the first
 to claim definite divine honours during his own life. On the death of
 his wife in 271 he proclaimed her deity and his own as well in the
 worship of the Theoi Adelphoi, the 'Gods Brethren'. Of course there was
 flattery in all this, ordinary self-interested lying flattery, and its
 <a name="page_155"><font size="1" color="green">p. 155</font></a> inevitable accompaniment, megalomania. Any reading of the personal
 history of the Ptolemies, the Seleucidae or the Caesars shows it. But
 that is not the whole explanation.</p>
 
 <p>One of the characteristics of the period of the Diadochi is the
 accumulation of capital and military force in the hands of individuals.
 The Ptolemies and Seleucidae had at any moment at their disposal powers
 very much greater than any Pericles or Nicias or Lysander.<a name="an_fr_155_1"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_155_1">155_1</a> The
 folk of the small cities of the Aegean hinterlands must have felt
 towards these great strangers almost as poor Indian peasants in time of
 flood and famine feel towards an English official. There were men now on
 earth who could do the things that had hitherto been beyond the power of
 man. Were several cities thrown down by earthquake; here was one who by
 his nod could build them again. Famines had always occurred and been
 mostly incurable. Here was one who could without effort allay a famine.
 Provinces were harried and wasted by habitual wars: the eventual
 conqueror had destroyed whole provinces in making the wars; now, as he
 had destroyed, he could also save. 'What do you mean by a god,' the
 simple man might say, 'if these men are not gods? The only difference is
 that these gods are visible, and the old gods no man has seen.'</p>
 
 <p>The titles assumed by all the divine kings tell the story clearly.
 Antiochus Epiphanês—'the god made manifest'; Ptolemaios Euergetês,
 Ptolemaios Sôtêr. Occasionally we have a Keraunos or a Nikator, a
 <a name="page_156"><font size="1" color="green">p. 156</font></a> 'Thunderbolt' or a 'God of Mana', but mostly it is Sôtêr, Euergetês and
 Epiphanês, the Saviour, the Benefactor, the God made manifest, in
 constant alternation. In the honorific inscriptions and in the writings
 of the learned, philanthropy (<ins class="greek" title="philanthrôpia">φιλανθρωπία</ins>) is by far the most
 prominent characteristic of the God upon earth. Was it that people
 really felt that to save or benefit mankind was a more godlike thing
 than to blast and destroy them? Philosophers have generally said that,
 and the vulgar pretended to believe them. It was at least politic, when
 ministering to the half-insane pride of one of these princes, to remind
 him of his mercy rather than of his wrath.</p>
 
 <p>Wendland in his brilliant book, <i>Hellenistisch-römische Kultur</i>, calls
 attention to an inscription of the year 196 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> in honour of the young
 Ptolemaios Epiphanês, who was made manifest at the age of twelve
 years.<a name="an_fr_156_1"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_156_1">156_1</a> It is a typical document of Graeco-Egyptian king-worship:</p>
 
 <div class="blockquot"><p>'In the reign of the young king by inheritance from his
 Father, Lord of the Diadems, great in glory, pacificator of
 Egypt and pious towards the gods, superior over his
 adversaries, Restorer of the life of man, Lord of the Periods

 the Great King of the Upper and Lower Lands; offspring of the
 Gods of the Love of the Father, whom Hephaistos has approved,
 to whom the Sun has given Victory; living image of Zeus; Son

 <p>The Priests who came to his coronation ceremony at Memphis proclaim:</p>
 
 <div class="blockquot"><p>'Seeing that King Ptolemaios ever-living, beloved of Phtha,
 God Manifest for whom Thanks be given, born of King Ptolemaios
 and Queen Arsinoe, the Gods of the Love of the Father, has
 done many benefactions to the Temples and those in them and
 all those beneath his rule, being from the beginning God born
 of God and Goddess, like Horus son of Isis and Osiris, who
 came to the help of his father Osiris (and?) in his benevolent
 disposition towards the Gods has consecrated to the temples
 revenues of silver and of corn, and has undergone many
 expenses in order to lead Egypt into the sunlight and give
 peace to the Temples, and has with all his powers shown love
 of mankind.'</p></div>

 <div class="blockquot"><p>'in a short time he took the city by storm and slew all the
 Impious who dwelt in it, even as Hermes and Horus, son of Isis
 and Osiris, conquered those who of old revolted in the same
 regions . . . in return for which the Gods have granted him
 Health Victory Power and all other good things, the Kingdom
 remaining to him and his sons for time everlasting.'<a name="an_fr_157_1"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_157_1">157_1</a></p></div>
 
 <p><a name="page_158"><font size="1" color="green">p. 158</font></a> </p><p>The conclusion which the Priests draw from these facts is that the
 young king's titles and honours are insufficient and should be
 increased. It is a typical and terribly un-Hellenic document of the
 Hellenistic God-man in his appearance as King.</p>
 
 <p>Now the early successors of Alexander mostly professed themselves
 members of the Stoic school, and in the mouth of a Stoic this doctrine
 of the potential divinity of man was an inspiring one. To them virtue
 was the really divine thing in man; and the most divine kind of virtue
 was that of helping humanity. To love and help humanity is, according to
 Stoic doctrine, the work and the very essence of God. If you take away
 Pronoia from God, says Chrysippus,<a name="an_fr_158_1"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_158_1">158_1</a> it is like taking away light
 and heat from fire. This doctrine is magnificently expressed by Pliny in
 a phrase that is probably translated from Posidonius: 'God is the
 helping of man by man; and that is the way to eternal glory.'<a name="an_fr_158_2"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_158_2">158_2</a></p>
 
 <p>The conception took root in the minds of many Romans. A great Roman
 governor often had the chance of thus helping humanity on a vast scale,
 and liked to think that such a life opened the way to heaven. 'One
 should conceive', says Cicero (<i>Tusc.</i> i. <a name="page_159"><font size="1" color="green">p. 159</font></a> 32), 'the gods as like men
 who feel themselves born for the work of helping, defending, and saving
 humanity. Hercules has passed into the number of the gods. He would
 never have so passed if he had not built up that road for himself while
 he was among mankind.'</p>
 
 <p>I have been using some rather late authors, though the ideas seem
 largely to come from Posidonius.<a name="an_fr_159_1"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_159_1">159_1</a> But before Posidonius the sort
 of fact on which we have been dwelling had had its influence on
 religious speculation. When Alexander made his conquering journey to
 India and afterwards was created a god, it was impossible not to reflect
 that almost exactly the same story was related in myth about Dionysus.
 Dionysus had started from India and travelled in the other direction:
 that was the only difference. A flood of light seemed to be thrown on
 all the traditional mythology, which, of course, had always been a
 puzzle to thoughtful men. It was impossible to believe it as it stood,
 and yet hard—in an age which had not the conception of any science of
 mythology—to think it was all a mass of falsehood, and the great Homer
 and Hesiod no better than liars. But the generation which witnessed the
 official deification of the various Seleucidae and Ptolemies seemed
 suddenly to see light. The traditional gods, from Heracles and Dionysus
 up to Zeus and Cronos and even Ouranos, were simply old-world rulers and
 benefactors of mankind, who had, by their own <a name="page_160"><font size="1" color="green">p. 160</font></a> insistence or the
 gratitude of their subjects, been transferred to the ranks of heaven.
 For that is the exact meaning of making them divine: they are classed
 among the true immortals, the Sun and Moon and Stars and Corn and Wine,
 and the everlasting elements.</p>
 
 <p>The philosophic romance of Euhemerus, published early in the third
 century <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>, had instantaneous success and enormous influence.<a name="an_fr_160_1"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_160_1">160_1</a>
 It was one of the first Greek books translated into Latin, and became
 long afterwards a favourite weapon of the Christian fathers in their
 polemics against polytheism. 'Euhemerism' was, on the face of it, a very
 brilliant theory; and it had, as we have noticed, a special appeal for
 the Romans.</p>
 
 <p>Yet, if such a conception might please the leisure of a statesman, it
 could hardly satisfy the serious thought of a philosopher or a religious
 man. If man's soul really holds a fragment of God and is itself a divine
 being, its godhead cannot depend on the possession of great riches and
 armies and organized subordinates. If 'the helping of man by man is
 God', the help in question cannot be material help. The religion which
 ends in deifying only kings and millionaires may be vulgarly popular but
 is self-condemned.</p>
 
 <p>As a matter of fact the whole tendency of Greek philosophy after Plato,
 with some illustrious exceptions, especially among the Romanizing
 Stoics, was away from the outer world towards the world of the soul. We
 find in the religious writings of this period that the real Saviour of
 men is not he who protects <a name="page_161"><font size="1" color="green">p. 161</font></a> them against earthquake and famine, but he
 who in some sense saves their souls. He reveals to them the <i>Gnôsis
 Theou</i>, the Knowledge of God. The 'knowledge' in question is not a mere
 intellectual knowledge. It is a complete union, a merging of beings.
 And, as we have always to keep reminding our cold modern intelligence,
 he who has 'known' God is himself thereby deified. He is the Image of
 God, the Son of God, in a sense he <i>is</i> God.<a name="an_fr_161_1"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_161_1">161_1</a> The stratum of ideas
 described in the first of the studies will explain the ease with which
 transition took place. The worshipper of Bacchos became Bacchos simply
 enough, because in reality the God Bacchos was originally only the
 projection of the human Bacchoi. And in the Hellenistic age the notion
 of these secondary mediating gods was made easier by the analogy of the
 human interpreters. Of course, we have abundant instances of actual
 preachers and miracle-workers who on their own authority posed, and were
 accepted, as gods. The adventure of Paul and Barnabas at Lystra<a name="an_fr_161_2"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_161_2">161_2</a>
 shows how easily such things could happen. But as a rule, I suspect, the
 most zealous priest or preacher preferred to have his God in the
 background. He preaches, he heals the sick and casts out devils, not in
 his own name but in the name of One who sent him. This actual present
 priest who initiates you or me is himself already an Image of God; but
 above him there are greater and <a name="page_162"><font size="1" color="green">p. 162</font></a> wiser priests, above them others, and
 above all there is the one eternal Divine Mediator, who being in
 perfection both man and God can alone fully reveal God to man, and lead
 man's soul up the heavenly path, beyond Change and Fate and the Houses
 of the Seven Rulers, to its ultimate peace. I have seen somewhere a
 Gnostic or early Christian emblem which indicates this doctrine. Some
 Shepherd or Saviour stands, his feet on the earth, his head towering
 above the planets, lifting his follower in his outstretched arms.</p>
 
 <p>The Gnostics are still commonly thought of as a body of Christian
 heretics. In reality there were Gnostic sects scattered over the
 Hellenistic world before Christianity as well as after. They must have
 been established in Antioch and probably in Tarsus well before the days
 of Paul or Apollos. Their Saviour, like the Jewish Messiah, was
 established in men's minds before the Saviour of the Christians. 'If we
 look close', says Professor Bousset, 'the result emerges with great
 clearness, that the figure of the Redeemer as such did not wait for
 Christianity to force its way into the religion of Gnôsis, but was
 already present there under various forms.'<a name="an_fr_162_1"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_162_1">162_1</a> He occurs notably in
 two pre-Christian documents, discovered by the keen analysis and
 profound learning of Dr. Reitzenstein: the Poimandres revelation printed
 in the <i>Corpus Hermeticum</i>, and the sermon of the Naassenes in
 Hippolytus, <i>Refutatio Omnium Haeresium</i>, which is combined with
 Attis-worship.<a name="an_fr_162_2"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_162_2">162_2</a> The violent anti-Jewish bias of most of the
 sects—they <a name="page_163"><font size="1" color="green">p. 163</font></a> speak of 'the accursed God of the Jews' and identify him
 with Saturn and the Devil—points on the whole to pre-Christian
 conditions: and a completely non-Christian standpoint is still visible
 in the Mandaean and Manichean systems.</p>
 
 <p>Their Redeemer is descended by a fairly clear genealogy from the 'Tritos
 Sôtêr' of early Greece, contaminated with similar figures, like Attis
 and Adonis from Asia Minor, Osiris from Egypt, and the special Jewish
 conception of the Messiah of the Chosen people. He has various names,
 which the name of Jesus or 'Christos', 'the Anointed', tends gradually
 to supersede. Above all he is, in some sense, Man, or 'the Second Man'
 or 'the Son of Man'. The origin of this phrase needs a word of
 explanation. Since the ultimate unseen God, spirit though He is, made
 man in His image, since holy men (and divine kings) are images of God,
 it follows that He is Himself Man. He is the real, the ultimate, the
 perfect and eternal Man, of whom all bodily men are feeble copies. He is
 also the Father; the Saviour is his Son, 'the Image of the Father', 'the
 Second Man', 'the Son of Man'. The method in which he performs his
 mystery of Redemption varies. It is haunted by the memory of the old
 Suffering and Dying God, of whom we spoke in the first of these studies.
 It is vividly affected by the ideal 'Righteous Man' of Plato, who 'shall
 be scourged, tortured, bound, his eyes burnt out, and at last, after
 suffering every evil, shall be impaled or crucified'.<a name="an_fr_163_1"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_163_1">163_1</a> But in <a name="page_164"><font size="1" color="green">p. 164</font></a> the
 main he descends, of his free will or by the eternal purpose of the
 Father, from Heaven through the spheres of all the Archontes or
 Kosmokratores, the planets, to save mankind, or sometimes to save the
 fallen Virgin, the Soul, Wisdom, or 'the Pearl'.<a name="an_fr_164_1"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_164_1">164_1</a> The Archontes
 let him pass because he is disguised; they do not know him (cf. 1 Cor.
 ii. 7 ff.). When his work is done he ascends to Heaven to sit by the
 side of the Father in glory; he conquers the Archontes, leads them
 captive in his triumph, strips them of their armour (Col. ii. 15; cf.
 the previous verse), sometimes even crucifies them for ever in their
 places in the sky.<a name="an_fr_164_2"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_164_2">164_2</a> The epistles to the Colossians and the
 Ephesians are much influenced by these doctrines. Paul himself
 constantly uses the language of them, but in the main we find him
 discouraging the excesses of superstition, reforming, ignoring,
 rejecting. His Jewish blood was perhaps enough to keep him to strict
 monotheism. Though he admits Angels and Archontes, Principalities and
 Powers, he scorns the Elements and he seems deliberately to reverse the
 doctrine of the first and second Man.<a name="an_fr_164_3"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_164_3">164_3</a> He says nothing about the
 Trinity of Divine Beings that was usual in Gnosticism, nothing about the
 Divine Mother. His mind, for all its vehement mysticism, has something
 of that clean antiseptic quality that makes such early Christian works
 as the Octavius of Minucius Felix and the Epistle to Diognetus so
 infinitely refreshing. He is certainly one of the great figures in Greek
 literature, but his system lies <a name="page_165"><font size="1" color="green">p. 165</font></a> outside the subject of this essay. We
 are concerned only with those last manifestations of Hellenistic
 religion which probably formed the background of his philosophy. It is a
 strange experience, and it shows what queer stuff we humans are made of,
 to study these obscure congregations, drawn from the proletariate of the
 Levant, superstitious, charlatan-ridden, and helplessly ignorant, who
 still believed in Gods begetting children of mortal mothers, who took
 the 'Word', the 'Spirit', and the 'Divine Wisdom', to be persons called
 by those names, and turned the Immortality of the Soul into 'the
 standing up of the corpses';<a name="an_fr_165_1"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_165_1">165_1</a> and to reflect that it was these who
 held the main road of advance towards the greatest religion of the
 western world.</p>
 
 <hr style="width: 45%;">
 
 <p>I have tried to sketch in outline the main forms of belief to which
 Hellenistic philosophy moved or drifted. Let me dwell for a few pages
 more upon the characteristic method by which it reached them. It may be
 summed up in one word, Allegory. All Hellenistic philosophy from the
 first Stoics onward is permeated by allegory. It is applied to Homer, to
 the religious traditions, to the ancient rituals, to the whole world. To
 Sallustius after the end of our period the whole material world is only
 a great myth, a thing whose value lies not in itself but in the
 spiritual meaning which it hides and reveals. To Cleanthes at the
 beginning of it the Universe was a mystic pageant, in which the immortal
 stars were the dancers and the Sun the priestly torch-bearer.<a name="an_fr_165_2"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_165_2">165_2</a>
 <a name="page_166"><font size="1" color="green">p. 166</font></a> Chrysippus reduced the Homeric gods to physical or ethical principles;
 and Crates, the great critic, applied allegory in detail to his
 interpretation of the all-wise poet.<a name="an_fr_166_1"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_166_1">166_1</a> We possess two small but
 complete treatises which illustrate well the results of this tendency,
 Cornutus <ins class="greek" title="peri theôn">ρεπὶ θεῶν</ins> and the <i>Homeric Allegories</i> of Heraclitus, a
 brilliant little work of the first century <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> I will not dwell upon
 details: they are abundantly accessible and individually often
 ridiculous. A by-product of the same activity is the mystic treatment of
 language: a certain Titan in Hesiod is named Koios. Why? Because the
 Titans are the elements and one of them is naturally the element of
 <ins class="greek" title="Koiotês">Κοιότης</ins>, the Ionic Greek for 'Quality'. The Egyptian Isis is derived
 from the root of the Greek <ins class="greek" title="eidenai">εἰδέναι</ins>, Knowledge, and the Egyptian Osiris
 from the Greek <ins class="greek" title="hosios">ὅσιος</ins> and <ins class="greek" title="hiros">ἱρός</ins> ('holy' and 'sacred', or perhaps
 more exactly 'lawful' and '<i>tabu</i>'). Is this totally absurd? I think
 not. If all human language is, as most of these thinkers believed, a
 divine institution, a cap filled to the brim with divine meaning, so
 that by reflecting deeply upon a word a pious philosopher can reach the
 secret that it holds, then there is no difficulty whatever in supposing
 that the special secret held by an Egyptian word may be found in Greek,
 or the secret of a Greek word in Babylonian. Language is One. The Gods
 who made all these languages equally could use them all, and wind them
 all intricately in and out, for the building up of their divine enigma.</p>
 
 <p>We must make a certain effort of imagination to understand this method
 of allegory. It is not the <a name="page_167"><font size="1" color="green">p. 167</font></a> frigid thing that it seems to us. In the
 first place, we should remember that, as applied to the ancient
 literature and religious ritual, allegory was at least a <i>vera
 causa</i>—it was a phenomenon which actually existed. Heraclitus of
 Ephesus is an obvious instance. He deliberately expressed himself in
 language which should not be understood of the vulgar, and which bore a
 hidden meaning to his disciples. Pythagoras did the same. The prophets
 and religious writers must have done so to an even greater
 extent.<a name="an_fr_167_1"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_167_1">167_1</a> And we know enough of the history of ritual to be sure
 that a great deal of it is definitely allegorical. The Hellenistic Age
 did not wantonly invent the theory of allegory.</p>
 
 <p>And secondly, we must remember what states of mind tend especially to
 produce this kind of belief. They are not contemptible states of mind.
 It needs only a strong idealism with which the facts of experience
 clash, and allegory follows almost of necessity. The facts cannot be
 accepted as they are. They must needs be explained as meaning something
 different.</p>
 
 <p>Take an earnest Stoic or Platonist, a man of fervid mind, who is
 possessed by the ideals of his philosophy and at the same time feels his
 heart thrilled by the beauty of the old poetry. What is he to do? On one
 side he can find Zoilus, or Plato himself, or the Cynic preachers,
 condemning Homer and the poets without remorse, as teachers of
 foolishness. He can treat poetry as the English puritans treated the
 stage. But is that a satisfactory solution? Remember that these
 generations were trained habitually to give great weight to the voice of
 their inner <a name="page_168"><font size="1" color="green">p. 168</font></a> consciousness, and the inner consciousness of a sensitive
 man cries out that any such solution is false: that Homer is not a liar,
 but noble and great, as our fathers have always taught us. On the other
 side comes Heraclitus the allegorist. 'If Homer used no allegories he
 committed all impieties.' On this theory the words can be allowed to
 possess all their old beauty and magic, but an inner meaning is added
 quite different from that which they bear on the surface. It may, very
 likely, be a duller and less poetic meaning; but I am not sure that the
 verses will not gain by the mere process of brooding study fully as much
 as they lose by the ultimate badness of the interpretation. Anyhow, that
 was the road followed. The men of whom I speak were not likely to give
 up any experience that seemed to make the world more godlike or to feed
 their spiritual and emotional cravings. They left that to the barefooted
 cynics. They craved poetry and they craved philosophy; if the two spoke
 like enemies, their words must needs be explained away by one who loved
 both.</p>
 
 <p>The same process was applied to the world itself. Something like it is
 habitually applied by the religious idealists of all ages. A fundamental
 doctrine of Stoicism and most of the idealist creeds was the perfection
 and utter blessedness of the world, and the absolute fulfilment of the
 purpose of God. Now obviously this belief was not based on experience.
 The poor world, to do it justice amid all its misdoings, has never lent
 itself to any such barefaced deception as that. No doubt it shrieked
 against the doctrine then, as loud as it has always shrieked, so that
 even a Posidonian or a Pythagorean, his ears straining for the music of
 the spheres, was <a name="page_169"><font size="1" color="green">p. 169</font></a> sometimes forced to listen. And what was his answer?
 It is repeated in all the literature of these sects. 'Our human
 experience is so small: the things of the earth may be bad and more than
 bad, but, ah! if you only went beyond the Moon! That is where the true
 Kosmos begins.' And, of course, if we did ever go there, we all know
 they would say it began beyond the Sun. Idealism of a certain type will
 have its way; if hard life produces an ounce or a pound or a million
 tons of fact in the scale against it, it merely dreams of infinite
 millions in its own scale, and the enemy is outweighed and smothered. I
 do not wish to mock at these Posidonian Stoics and Hermetics and
 Gnostics and Neo-Pythagoreans. They loved goodness, and their faith is
 strong and even terrible. One feels rather inclined to bow down before
 their altars and cry: <i>Magna est Delusio et praevalebit.</i></p>
 
 <p>Yet on the whole one rises from these books with the impression that all
 this allegory and mysticism is bad for men. It may make the emotions
 sensitive, it certainly weakens the understanding. And, of course, in
 this paper I have left out of account many of the grosser forms of
 superstition. In any consideration of the balance, they should not be
 forgotten.</p>
 
 <p>If a reader of Proclus and the <i>Corpus Hermeticum</i> wants relief, he will
 find it, perhaps, best in the writings of a gentle old Epicurean who
 lived at Oenoanda in Cappadocia about <span class="smcap">a. d.</span> 200. His name was
 Diogenes.<a name="an_fr_169_1"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_169_1">169_1</a> His works are preserved, in a fragmentary state, not on
 papyrus or parchment, but on the wall of a large portico where he
 engraved them for passers-by to read. He lived in a world of
 <a name="page_170"><font size="1" color="green">p. 170</font></a> superstition and foolish terror, and he wrote up the great doctrines of
 Epicurus for the saving of mankind.</p>
 
 <div class="blockquot"><p>'Being brought by age to the sunset of my life, and expecting
 at any moment to take my departure from the world with a glad
 song for the fullness of my happiness, I have resolved, lest I
 be taken too soon, to give help to those of good temperament.
 If one person or two or three or four, or any small number you
 choose, were in distress, and I were summoned out to help one
 after another, I would do all in my power to give the best
 counsel to each. But now, as I have said, the most of men lie
 sick, as it were of a pestilence, in their false beliefs about
 the world, and the tale of them increases; for by imitation
 they take the disease from one another, like sheep. And
 further it is only just to bring help to those who shall come
 after us—for they too are ours, though they be yet unborn;
 and love for man commands us also to help strangers who may
 pass by. Since therefore the good message of the Book has this
 wall and to set forth in public the medicine of the healing of
 mankind.'</p></div>
 
 <p>The people of his time and neighbourhood seem to have fancied that the
 old man must have some bad motive. They understood mysteries and
 redemptions and revelations. They understood magic and curses. But they
 were puzzled, apparently, by this simple message, which only told them
 to use their reason, their courage, and their sympathy, and not to be
 afraid of death or of angry gods. The doctrine was condensed into four
 sentences of a concentrated eloquence that make a translator
 despair:<a name="an_fr_170_1"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_170_1">170_1</a> 'Nothing <a name="page_171"><font size="1" color="green">p. 171</font></a> to fear in God: Nothing to feel in Death: Good
 can be attained: Evil can be endured.'</p>
 
 <p>Of course, the doctrines of this good old man do not represent the whole
 truth. To be guided by one's aversions is always a sign of weakness or
 defeat; and it is as much a failure of nerve to reject blindly for fear
 of being a fool, as to believe blindly for fear of missing some
 emotional stimulus.</p>
 
 <p>There is no royal road in these matters. I confess it seems strange to
 me as I write here, to reflect that at this moment many of my friends
 and most of my fellow creatures are, as far as one can judge, quite
 confident that they possess supernatural knowledge. As a rule, each
 individual belongs to some body which has received in writing the
 results of a divine revelation. I cannot share in any such feeling. The
 Uncharted surrounds us on every side and we must needs have some
 relation towards it, a relation which will depend on the general
 discipline of a man's mind and the bias of his whole character. As far
 as knowledge and conscious reason will go, we should follow resolutely
 their austere guidance. When they cease, as cease they must, we must use
 as best we can those fainter powers of apprehension and surmise and
 sensitiveness by which, after all, most high truth has been reached as
 well as most high art and poetry: careful always really to seek for
 truth and not for our own emotional satisfaction, careful not to neglect
 the real needs of men and women through basing our life on dreams; and
 remembering above all to walk gently in a world where the lights are dim
 and the very stars wander.</p>

 into account are Hippolytis (<ins class="explain" title="cross symbol">✝</ins> <span class="smcap">a. d.</span> 250), <i>Refutatio
 Omnium Haeresium</i>, Epiphanius (367-403), <i>Panarion</i>, and Irenaeus
 (<ins class="explain" title="cross symbol">✝</ins> <span class="smcap">a. d.</span> 202), <i>Contra Haereses</i>, i, ii. For a simple
 introduction to the problems presented by the New Testament literature I
 would venture to recommend Prof. Bacon's <i>New Testament</i>, in the Home
 University Library, and Dr. Estlin Carpenter's <i>First Three Gospels</i>. In
 such a vast literature I dare not make any further recommendations, but
 for a general introduction to the History of Religions with a good and
 brief bibliography I would refer the reader to Salomon Reinach's
 <i>Orpheus</i> (Paris, 1909; English translation the same year), a book of
 wide learning and vigorous thought.</p>

 <h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>
 
 <div class="footnote"><p><a name="an_fn_124_1"></a><a href="fsgr08.htm#an_fr_124_1">124_1</a> Mr. Marett has pointed out that this conception has its
 roots deep in primitive human nature: <i>The Birth of Humility</i>, Oxford,
 1910, p. 17. 'It would, perhaps, be fanciful to say that man tends to
 run away from the sacred as uncanny, to cower before it as secret, and
 to prostrate himself before it as tabu. On the other hand, it seems
 plain that to these three negative qualities of the sacred taken
 together there corresponds on the part of man a certain negative
 attitude of mind. Psychologists class the feelings bound up with flight,
 cowering, and prostration under the common head of "asthenic emotion".
 In plain English they are all forms of heart-sinking, of feeling
 unstrung. This general type of innate disposition would seem to be the
 psychological basis of Humility. Taken in its social setting, the
 emotion will, of course, show endless shades of complexity; for it will
 be excited, and again will find practical expression, in all sorts of
 ways. Under these varying conditions, however, it is reasonable to
 suppose that what Mr. McDougall would call the "central part" of the
 experience remains very much the same. In face of the sacred the normal
 man is visited by a heart-sinking, a wave of asthenic emotion.' Mr.
 Marett continues: 'If that were all, however, Religion would be a matter
 of pure fear. But it is not all. There is yet the positive side of the
 sacred to be taken into account.' It is worth remarking also that
 Schleiermacher (1767-1834) placed the essence of religion in the feeling
 of absolute dependence without attempting to define the object towards
 which it was directed.</p></div>

 text is perhaps the interesting fragment of Demetrius of Phalerum (fr.
 19, in <i>F. H. G.</i> ii. 368), written about 317 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> It is quoted with
 admiration by Polybius xxix. 21, with reference to the defeat of Perseus
 of Macedon by the Romans:</p>
 
 <p>'One must often remember the saying of Demetrius of Phalerum . . . in his
 Treatise on Fortune. . . . "If you were to take not an indefinite time, nor
 many generations, but just the fifty years before this, you could see in
 them the violence of Fortune. Fifty years ago do you suppose that either
 the Macedonians or the King of Macedon, or the Persians or the King of
 Persia, if some God had foretold them what was to come, would ever have
 believed that by the present time the Persians, who were then masters of
 almost all the inhabited world, would have ceased to be even a
 geographical name, while the Macedonians, who were then not even a name,
 would be rulers of all? Yet this Fortune, who bears no relation to our
 method of life, but transforms everything in the way we do not expect
 and displays her power by surprises, is at the present moment showing
 all the world that, when she puts the Macedonians into the rich
 inheritance of the Persian, she has only lent them these good things
 until she changes her mind about them." Which has now happened in the
 case of Perseus. The words of Demetrius were a prophecy uttered, as it
 were, by inspired lips.'</p></div>

 feel it. We have said that he was vigilant and pure of soul, and always
 striving towards the Divine, which with all his soul he loved. . . . And
 thus it happened to this extraordinary man, constantly lifting himself
 up towards the first and transcendent God by thought and the ways
 explained by Plato in the <i>Symposium</i>, that there actually came a vision
 of that God who is without shape or form, established above the
 understanding and all the intelligible world. To whom I, Porphyry, being
 now in my sixty-eighth year, profess that I once drew near and was made
 one with him. At any rate he appeared to Plotinus "a goal close at
 hand." For his whole end and goal was to be made One and draw near to
 the supreme God. And he attained that goal four times, I think, while I
 was living with him—not potentially but in actuality, though an
 actuality which surpasses speech.'</p></div>
