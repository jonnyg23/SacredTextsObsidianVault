 <h3 align="CENTER">SOCRATES - POLEMARCHUS - GLAUCON - ADEIMANTUS</h3>
 <p>Polemarchus said to me: I perceive, Socrates, that you and our companion are already on your way to the city.</p>
 <p>You are not far wrong, I said.</p>
 <p>But do you see, he rejoined, how many we are?</p>
 <p>Of course.</p>
 <p>And are you stronger than all these? for if not, you will have to remain where you are.</p>
 <p>May there not be the alternative, I said, that we may persuade you to let us go?</p>
 <p>But can you persuade us, if we refuse to listen to you? he said.</p>
 <p>Certainly not, replied Glaucon.</p>
 <p>Then we are not going to listen; of that you may be assured.</p>
 <p>Adeimantus added: Has no one told you of the torch-race on horseback in honour of the goddess which will take place in the evening?</p>
 <p>With horses! I replied: That is a novelty. Will horsemen carry torches and pass them one to another during the race?</p>
 <p>Yes, said Polemarchus, and not only so, but a festival will he celebrated at night, which you certainly ought to see. Let us rise soon after supper and see this festival; there will be a gathering of young men, and we will have a good talk. Stay then, and do not be perverse.</p>
 <p>Glaucon said: I suppose, since you insist, that we must.</p>
 <p>Very good, I replied.</p>
