 <p>14. Thus it comes about that this kosmos, lit with many lights,
 gleaming in its souls, receives still further graces, gifts from
 here and from there, from the gods of the Supreme, and from those
 other Intellectual-Principles whose nature it is to ensoul. This is
 probably the secret of the myth in which, after Prometheus 
 had moulded
 woman, the other gods heaped gifts upon her, Hephaistos "blending
 the clay with moisture and bestowing the human voice and the 
 form of a
 goddess"; Aphrodite bringing her gifts, and the Graces theirs, and
 other gods other gifts, and finally calling her by the name
 [Pandora] which tells of gift and of all giving- for all have added
 something to this formation brought to being by a Promethean, a
 fore-thinking power. As for the rejection of Prometheus' gift by
 after-thought, Epimetheus, what can this signify but that the wiser
 choice is to remain in the Intellectual realm? Pandora's creator is
 fettered, to signify that he is in some sense held by his own
 creation; such a fettering is external and the release by Hercules
 tells that there is power in Prometheus, so that he need not 
 remain in
 bonds.
 
 </p><p>Take the myth as we may, it is certainly such an account of the
 bestowal of gifts upon the kosmos as harmonizes with our explanation
 of the universal system.
