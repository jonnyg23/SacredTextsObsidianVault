 <p>24. With regard to locomotion: if ascending is to be 
 held contrary
 to descending, and circular motion different [in kind] from motion
 in a straight line, we may ask how this difference is to be defined-
 the difference, for example, between throwing over the head and
 under the feet.
 
 </p><p>The driving power is one- though indeed it might be maintained
 that the upward drive is different from the downward, and 
 the downward
 passage of a different character from the upward, especially if it
 be a natural motion, in which case the up-motion constitutes
 lightness, the down-motion heaviness.
 
 </p><p>But in all these motions alike there is the common tendency to
 seek an appointed place, and in this tendency we seem to have the
 differentia which separates locomotion from the other species.
 
 </p><p>As for motion in a circle and motion in a straight line, if the
 former is in practice indistinguishable from the latter, how can we
 regard them as different? The only difference lies in the 
 shape of the
 course, unless the view be taken that circular motion is "impure,"
 as not being entirely a motion, not involving a complete surrender
 of identity.
 
 </p><p>However, it appears in general that locomotion is a definite
 unity, taking its differences from externals.
