 <p>4. In that realm it has also vision, through the
 Intellectual-Principle, of The Good which does not so hold to itself
 as not to reach the soul; what intervenes between them is 
 not body and
 therefore is no hindrance- and, indeed, where bodily forms do
 intervene there is still access in many ways from the primal to the
 tertiaries.
 
 </p><p>If, on the contrary, the soul gives itself to the inferior, the
 same principle of penetration comes into play, and it possesses
 itself, by memory and imagination, of the thing it desired: and
 hence the memory, even dealing with the highest, is not the highest.
 Memory, of course, must be understood not merely of what might be
 called the sense of remembrance, but so as to include a condition
 induced by the past experience or vision. There is such a thing as
 possessing more powerfully without consciousness than in full
 knowledge; with full awareness the possession is of something quite
 distinct from the self; unconscious possession runs very close to
 identity, and any such approach to identification with the 
 lower means
 the deeper fall of the soul.
 
 </p><p>If the soul, on abandoning its place in the Supreme, revives its
 memories of the lower, it must have in some form possessed them even
 there though the activity of the beings in that realm kept them in
 abeyance: they could not be in the nature of impressions permanently
 adopted- a notion which would entail absurdities- but were no more
 than a potentiality realized after return. When that energy of the
 Intellectual world ceases to tell upon the soul, it sees what it saw
 in the earlier state before it revisited the Supreme.
