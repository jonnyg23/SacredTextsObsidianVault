 <p>2. What, then, of the "Number of the Infinite"?
 
 </p><p>To begin with, how is Number consistent with infinity?
 
 </p><p>Objects of sense are not unlimited and therefore the Number
 applying to them cannot be so. Nor is an enumerator able to number
 to infinity; though we double, multiply over and over again, we
 still end with a finite number; though we range over past and
 future, and consider them, even, as a totality, we still end with
 the finite.
 
 </p><p>Are we then to dismiss absolute limitlessness and think merely
 that there is always something beyond?
 
 </p><p>No; that more is not in the reckoner's power to produce; 
 the total
 stands already defined.
 
 </p><p>In the Intellectual the Beings are determined and with them
 Number, the number corresponding to their total; in this 
 sphere of our
 own- as we make a man a multiple by counting up his various
 characteristics, his beauty and the rest- we take each image of
 Being and form a corresponding image of number; we multiply a
 non-existent in and so produce multiple numbers; if we 
 number years we
 draw on the numbers in our own minds and apply them to the years;
 these numbers are still our possession.
