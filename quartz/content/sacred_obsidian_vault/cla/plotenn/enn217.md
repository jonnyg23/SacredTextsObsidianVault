 <p>4. But is this lower extremity of our intellective phase
 fettered to body for ever?
 
 </p><p>No: if we turn, this turns by the same act.
 
 </p><p>And the Soul of the All- are we to think that when it turns from
 this sphere its lower phase similarly withdraws?
 
 </p><p>No: for it never accompanied that lower phase of itself; it
 never knew any coming, and therefore never came down; it remains
 unmoved above, and the material frame of the Universe draws close to
 it, and, as it were, takes light from it, no hindrance to it, in no
 way troubling it, simply lying unmoved before it.
 
 </p><p>But has the Universe, then, no sensation? "It has no Sight," we
 read, since it has no eyes, and obviously it has not ears, nostrils,
 or tongue. Then has it perhaps such a consciousness as we have of
 our own inner conditions?
 
 </p><p>No: where all is the working out of one nature, there is nothing
 but still rest; there is not even enjoyment. Sensibility is 
 present as
 the quality of growth is, unrecognized. But the Nature of the World
 will be found treated elsewhere; what stands here is all that the
 question of the moment demands.
