 <p>1. Supposing we played a little before entering upon our serious
 concern and maintained that all things are striving after
 Contemplation, looking to Vision as their one end- and this, not
 merely beings endowed with reason but even the unreasoning animals,
 the Principle that rules in growing things, and the Earth that
 produces these- and that all achieve their purpose in the measure
 possible to their kind, each attaining Vision and possessing 
 itself of
 the End in its own way and degree, some things in entire reality,
 others in mimicry and in image- we would scarcely find anyone to
 endure so strange a thesis. But in a discussion entirely among
 ourselves there is no risk in a light handling of our own ideas.
 
 </p><p>Well- in the play of this very moment am I engaged in the act of
 Contemplation?
 
 </p><p>Yes; I and all that enter this play are in 
 Contemplation: our play
 aims at Vision; and there is every reason to believe that child or
 man, in sport or earnest, is playing or working only towards Vision,
 that every act is an effort towards Vision; the compulsory act,
 which tends rather to bring the Vision down to outward 
 things, and the
 act thought of as voluntary, less concerned with the outer,
 originate alike in the effort towards Vision.
 
 </p><p>The case of Man will be treated later on; let us speak, first,
 of the earth and of the trees and vegetation in general, asking
 ourselves what is the nature of Contemplation in them, how we relate
 to any Contemplative activity the labour and productiveness of the
 earth, how Nature, held to be devoid of reason and even of conscious
 representation, can either harbour Contemplation or produce by means
 of the Contemplation which it does not possess.
