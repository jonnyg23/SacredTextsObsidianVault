 <p>10. Time, again, has been described as some sort of a sequence
 upon Movement, but we learn nothing from this, nothing is said,
 until we know what it is that produces this sequential 
 thing: probably
 the cause and not the result would turn out to be Time.
 
 </p><p>And, admitting such a thing, there would still remain 
 the question
 whether it came into being before the movement, with it, or after
 it; and, whether we say before or with or after, we are speaking of
 order in Time: and thus our definition is "Time is a sequence upon
 movement in Time!"
 
 </p><p>Enough: Our main purpose is to show what Time is, not to refute
 false definition. To traverse point by point the many opinions of
 our many predecessors would mean a history rather than an
 identification; we have treated the various theories as fully as is
 possible in a cursory review: and, notice, that which makes Time the
 Measure of the All-Movement is refuted by our entire discussion and,
 especially, by the observations upon the Measurement of Movement in
 general, for all the argument- except, of course, that from
 irregularity- applies to the All as much as to particular Movement.
 
 </p><p>We are, thus, at the stage where we are to state what Time
 really is.
