 <p>14. Of the corporeal thus brought into being by Nature the
 elemental materials of things are its very produce, but how do
 animal and vegetable forms stand to it?
 
 </p><p>Are we to think of them as containers of Nature present within
 them?
 
 </p><p>Light goes away and the air contains no trace of it, for 
 light and
 air remain each itself, never coalescing: is this the relation of
 Nature to the formed object?
 
 </p><p>It is rather that existing between fire and the object it has
 warmed: the fire withdrawn, there remains a certain warmth, distinct
 from that in the fire, a property, so to speak, of the object
 warmed. For the shape which Nature imparts to what it has 
 moulded must
 be recognized as a form quite distinct from Nature itself, though it
 remains a question to be examined whether besides this 
 [specific] form
 there is also an intermediary, a link connecting it with Nature, the
 general principle.
 
 </p><p>The difference between Nature and the Wisdom described 
 as dwelling
 in the All has been sufficiently dealt with.
