 <p>6. Souls that descend, souls that change their state- 
 these, then,
 may be said to have memory, which deals with what has come and gone;
 but what subjects of remembrance can there be for souls whose lot is
 to remain unchanged?
 
 </p><p>The question touches memory in the stars in general, and also in
 the sun and moon and ends by dealing with the soul of the 
 All, even by
 audaciously busying itself with the memories of Zeus himself. The
 enquiry entails the examination and identification of acts of
 understanding and of reasoning in these beings, if such acts take
 place.
 
 </p><p>Now if, immune from all lack, they neither seek nor doubt, and
 never learn, nothing being absent at any time from their knowledge-
 what reasonings, what processes of rational investigation, can take
 place in them, what acts of the understanding?
 
 </p><p>Even as regards human concerns they have no need for observation
 or method; their administration of our affairs and of earth's in
 general does not go so; the right ordering, which is their 
 gift to the
 universe, is effected by methods very different.
 
 </p><p>In other words, they have seen God and they do not remember?
 
 </p><p>Ah, no: it is that they see God still and always, and that, as
 long as they see, they cannot tell themselves they have had the
 vision; such reminiscence is for souls that have lost it.
