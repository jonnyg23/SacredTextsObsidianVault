 <p>2. Therefore we must affirm no more than these three Primals: we
 are not to introduce superfluous distinctions which their nature
 rejects. We are to proclaim one Intellectual-Principle unchangeably
 the same, in no way subject to decline, acting in imitation, as true
 as its nature allows, of the Father.
 
 </p><p>And as to our own Soul we are to hold that it stands, in part,
 always in the presence of The Divine Beings, while in part it is
 concerned with the things of this sphere and in part 
 occupies a middle
 ground. It is one nature in graded powers; and sometimes the Soul in
 its entirety is borne along by the loftiest in itself and in the
 Authentic Existent; sometimes, the less noble part is 
 dragged down and
 drags the mid-soul with it, though the law is that the Soul may
 never succumb entire.
 
 </p><p>The Soul's disaster falls upon it when it ceases to dwell in the
 perfect Beauty- the appropriate dwelling-place of that Soul which is
 no part and of which we too are no part- thence to pour 
 forth into the
 frame of the All whatsoever the All can hold of good and 
 beauty. There
 that Soul rests, free from all solicitude, not ruling by plan or
 policy, not redressing, but establishing order by the marvellous
 efficacy of its contemplation of the things above it.
 
 </p><p>For the measure of its absorption in that vision is the 
 measure of
 its grace and power, and what it draws from this contemplation it
 communicates to the lower sphere, illuminated and 
 illuminating always.
