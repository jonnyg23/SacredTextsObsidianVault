 <p>4. So it is with the individual souls; the appetite for 
 the divine
 Intellect urges them to return to their source, but they have, too,
 a power apt to administration in this lower sphere; they may be
 compared to the light attached upwards to the sun, but not grudging
 its presidency to what lies beneath it. In the Intellectual, then,
 they remain with soul-entire, and are immune from care and 
 trouble; in
 the heavenly sphere, absorbed in the soul-entire, they are
 administrators with it just as kings, associated with the supreme
 ruler and governing with him, do not descend from their kingly
 stations: the souls indeed [as distinguished from the 
 kosmos] are thus
 far in the one place with their overlord; but there comes a stage at
 which they descend from the universal to become partial and
 self-centred; in a weary desire of standing apart they find 
 their way,
 each to a place of its very own. This state long maintained, the
 soul is a deserter from the All; its differentiation has severed it;
 its vision is no longer set in the Intellectual; it is a partial
 thing, isolated, weakened, full of care, intent upon the fragment;
 severed from the whole, it nestles in one form of being; for this,
 it abandons all else, entering into and caring for only the 
 one, for a
 thing buffeted about by a worldful of things: thus it has 
 drifted away
 from the universal and, by an actual presence, it administers the
 particular; it is caught into contact now, and tends to the outer to
 which it has become present and into whose inner depths it
 henceforth sinks far.
 
 </p><p>With this comes what is known as the casting of the wings, the
 enchaining in body: the soul has lost that innocency of 
 conducting the
 higher which it knew when it stood with the All-Soul, that earlier
 state to which all its interest would bid it hasten back.
 
 </p><p>It has fallen: it is at the chain: debarred from 
 expressing itself
 now through its intellectual phase, it operates through 
 sense, it is a
 captive; this is the burial, the encavernment, of the Soul.
 
 </p><p>But in spite of all it has, for ever, something 
 transcendent: by a
 conversion towards the intellective act, it is loosed from the
 shackles and soars- when only it makes its memories the 
 starting point
 of a new vision of essential being. Souls that take this way have
 place in both spheres, living of necessity the life there 
 and the life
 here by turns, the upper life reigning in those able to consort more
 continuously with the divine Intellect, the lower dominant where
 character or circumstances are less favourable.
 
 </p><p>All this is indicated by Plato, without emphasis, where he
 distinguishes those of the second mixing-bowl, describes them as
 "parts," and goes on to say that, having in this way become partial,
 they must of necessity experience birth.
 
 </p><p>Of course, where he speaks of God sowing them, he is to be
 understood as when he tells of God speaking and delivering orations;
 what is rooted in the nature of the All is figuratively treated as
 coming into being by generation and creation: stage and sequence are
 transferred, for clarity of exposition, to things whose being and
 definite form are eternal.
