 <p>11. In childhood the main activity is in the Couplement and
 there is but little irradiation from the higher principles of our
 being: but when these higher principles act but feebly or rarely
 upon us their action is directed towards the Supreme; they work upon
 us only when they stand at the mid-point.
 
 </p><p>But does not the include that phase of our being which stands
 above the mid-point?
 
 </p><p>It does, but on condition that we lay hold of it: our entire
 nature is not ours at all times but only as we direct the mid-point
 upwards or downwards, or lead some particular phase of our 
 nature from
 potentiality or native character into act.
 
 </p><p>And the animals, in what way or degree do they possess the
 Animate?
 
 </p><p>If there be in them, as the opinion goes, human Souls that have
 sinned, then the Animating-Principle in its separable phase does not
 enter directly into the brute; it is there but not there to 
 them; they
 are aware only of the image of the Soul [only of the lower Soul] and
 of that only by being aware of the body organised and determined by
 that image.
 
 </p><p>If there be no human Soul in them, the Animate is constituted
 for them by a radiation from the All-Soul.
