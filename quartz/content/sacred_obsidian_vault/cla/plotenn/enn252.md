 <p>1. Eternity and Time; two entirely separate things, we explain
 "the one having its being in the everlasting Kind, the other in the
 realm of Process, in our own Universe"; and, by continually using
 the words and assigning every phenomenon to the one or the other
 category, we come to think that, both by instinct and by the more
 detailed attack of thought, we hold an adequate experience of them
 in our minds without more ado.
 
 </p><p>When, perhaps, we make the effort to clarify our ideas and close
 into the heart of the matter we are at once unsettled: our doubts
 throw us back upon ancient explanations; we choose among the various
 theories, or among the various interpretations of some one 
 theory, and
 so we come to rest, satisfied, if only we can counter a question
 with an approved answer, and glad to be absolved from 
 further enquiry.
 
 </p><p>Now, we must believe that some of the venerable philosophers of
 old discovered the truth; but it is important to examine 
 which of them
 really hit the mark and by what guiding principle we can ourselves
 attain to certitude.
 
 </p><p>What, then, does Eternity really mean to those who describe it
 as something different from Time? We begin with Eternity, since when
 the standing Exemplar is known, its representation in image- which
 Time is understood to be- will be clearly apprehended- 
 though it is of
 course equally true, admitting this relationship to Time as image to
 Eternity the original, that if we chose to begin by identifying Time
 we could thence proceed upwards by Recognition [the Platonic
 Anamnesis] and become aware of the Kind which it images.
