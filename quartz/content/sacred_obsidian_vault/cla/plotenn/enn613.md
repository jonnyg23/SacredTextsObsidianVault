 <p>7. To Real Being we go back, all that we have and are; to that
 we return as from that we came. Of what is There we have direct
 knowledge, not images or even impressions; and to know without image
 is to be; by our part in true knowledge we are those Beings; 
 we do not
 need to bring them down into ourselves, for we are There among them.
 Since not only ourselves but all other things also are those Beings,
 we all are they; we are they while we are also one with all: 
 therefore
 we and all things are one.
 
 </p><p>When we look outside of that on which we depend we ignore our
 unity; looking outward we see many faces; look inward and all is the
 one head. If man could but be turned about by his own motion 
 or by the
 happy pull of Athene- he would see at once God and himself and the
 All. At first no doubt all will not be seen as one whole, but when
 we find no stop at which to declare a limit to our being we cease to
 rule ourselves out from the total of reality; we reach to 
 the All as a
 unity- and this not by any stepping forward, but by the fact of
 being and abiding there where the All has its being.
