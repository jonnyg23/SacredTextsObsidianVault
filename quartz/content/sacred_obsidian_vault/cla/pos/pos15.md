 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Softer</span> than mists oer the pale green of waters,<br> Oer the charmed sea, shod with sandals of shadow<br> Comes the warm sleep wind of Argolis, floating<br>                 Garlands of fragrance;</p>  
 <p>Comes the sweet wind by the still hours attended,<br> Touching tired lids on the shores dim with distance,<br> Ever its way toward the headland of Lesbos,<br>                 Toward Mitylene.</p>  
 <p>Faintly one fair star of evening enkindles<br> On the dusk afar its lone fire tean,<br> Shining serene till the darkness will deepen<br>                 Others to splendor;</p>  
 <p>Bringing ineffable peace, and the gladsome<br> Return with the night of all things that morning<br> Ruthlessly parted, the child to its mother,<br>                 Lover to lover.</p>  
 <p>From the marble court of rose-crowned companions,<br> All alone my feet again seek the little<br> Theatre pledged to the Muse, now deserted,<br>                 Facing the surges;</p>  
 <p>Where the carved Pan-heads that laugh down the gentle<br> Slope of broad steps to the refluent ripple,<br> Flute from their thin pipes the dithyrambs deathless,<br>                 Songs all unuttered.</p>  
 <p>Empty each seat where my girl friends acclaimed me,<br> Poets with names on the tiered stone engraven,<br> Over whose verge blooms the apple tree, drifting<br>                 Perfume and petals;</p>  
 <p>Gone Telesippa and tender Gyrinno,<br> Anactoria, woman divine; Atthis,<br> Subtlest of soul, fair Damophyla, Dica,<br>                 Maids of the Muses.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_18"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 18</font></a></p>  
 <p>Here an hour past soul-enravished they listened<br> While my rapt heart breathed its pæan impassioned,<br> Chanted its wild prayer to thee, Aphrodite,<br>                 Daughter of Cyprus;</p>  
 <p>Now to their homes are they gone in the city,<br> Pensive to dream limb-relaxed while the languid<br> Slaves come and lift from the tresses they loosen,<br>                 Flowers that have faded.</p>  
 <p>Thou alone, Sappho, art sole with the silence,<br> Sole with night and dreams that are darkness, weaving<br> Thoughts that are sighs from the heart and their meaning<br>                 Vague as the shadow;</p>  
 <p>When the great silence shall come to thee, sad one,<br> Men that forget shall remember thy music,<br> Murmur thy name that shall steal on their passion<br>                 Soft as the sleep wind.</p>
