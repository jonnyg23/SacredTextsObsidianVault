 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">All</span> around through the apple boughs in blossom<br> Murmur cool the breezes of early summer,<br> And from leaves that quiver above me gently<br>             Slumber is shaken;</p>  
 <p>Glades of poppies swoon in the drowsy languor,<br> Dreaming roses bend, and the oleanders<br> Bask and nod to drone of bees in the silent<br>             Fervor of noontide;</p>  
 <p>Myrtle coverts hedging the open vista,<br> Dear to nightly frolic of Nymph and Satyr,<br> Yield a mossy bed for the brown and weary<br>             Limbs of the shepherd.</p>  
 <p>Echo ever wafts through the drooping frondage,<br> Ceaseless silver murmur of water falling<br> In the grotto cool of the Nymphs, the sacred<br>             Haunt of Immortals;</p>  
 <p>Down the sides of rocks that are gray and lichened<br> Trickle tiny rills, whose expectant tinkle<br> Drips with gurgle hushed in the clear glimmering<br>             Depths of the basin.</p>  
 <p>Fair on royal couches of leaves recumbent,<br> Interspersed with languor of waxen lilies,<br> Lotus flowers empurple the pool whose edge is<br>             Cushioned with mosses;</p>  
 <p>Here recline the Nymphs at the hour of twilight,<br> Back in shadows dim of the cave, their golden<br> Sea-green eyes half lidded, up to their supple<br>             Waists in the water.</p>  
 <p>Sheltered once by ferns I espied them binding<br> Tresses long, the tint of lilac and orange;<br> Just beyond the shimmer of light their bodies<br>             Roseate glistened;</p>  
 <p><a name="page_12"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 12</font></a></p>  
 <p>Deftly, then, they girdled their loins with garlands,<br> Linked with leaves luxuriant limb and shoulder;<br> On their breasts they bruised the red blood of roses<br>             Fresh from the garden.</p>  
 <p>She of orange hair was the Nymph Euxanthis,<br> And the lilac-tressed were Iphis and Io;<br> How they laughed, relating at length their ease in<br>             Evading the Satyr.</p>
