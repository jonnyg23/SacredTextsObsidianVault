 meaning of <tt>h?mitu'bion</tt>. This was a piece of soft linen for
 wiping the hands.</p>

 <p>Maidens, although I am dumb, yet thus I speak, if any ask
 and place at your feet one with an untiring voice: To
 Aethopia the daughter of Leto was I consecrated by Arista,
 daugther of Hermocleides Saonaiades, thy servent, O queen
 of women; whom mayest thou bless and deign to glorify our
 house.</p><p>
 
 </p><p>From the Greek Anthology. It is a difficult and obscure
 piece. Bergk has not attempted to restore the Aeolic form.</p>

 <p>This is the dust of Timas whom the dark chamber of
 Persephone recieved, dead before her wedding; when she died
 all her companions clipped with sharpened metal all
 their lovely tresses.
 
 </p><blockquote>
 <pre>
 Here rests the dust of Timas who, unwed,
 Passed the dark portals of Persephone.
 With sharpened metal, when her spirit fled,
 Her mourning friends each shore her fair-tressed head.
 </pre>
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>The version of J.A. Symonds is as follows:</p>
 
 <blockquote>
 <pre>
 This is the dust of Timas, whom, unwed,
 Persephone locked in her darksome bed:
 For her, the maids who were her fellows, shore
 Their curls and to her tomb this tribute bore.
 </pre>
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>The verse is from the Greek Anthology.</p>

 Far sweeter than the throbbing lyre in sound,
 A voice more golden than gold, new found.

 <p>Maximus Tyrius says that Socrates calls Love the wizard,
 while Sappho uses the term <tt>myðoplo'kos</tt>, "fiction weaving."</p>

 <p>Aristides quotes Sappho as saying <tt>to` ga'nos ... ou? diafðei^ron

 <p>With rosy cheeks and glancing eyes and voices sweet as honey.</p>
 
 <p>Philostratus says that this indeed is Sappho's sweet salutation.</p>
 
 <p>Aristaenetus says that Sappho in a hymeneal song uses the epithet
 <tt>meilixo'fwnoi</tt>, "soft voiced".</p>

 <p>Pausanias, about A.D. 180, says of Sappho that concerning love
 she sang many things that do not always agree with one another.</p>

 <p>Himerius, apparently quoting, says "Thou are the evening star,
 of all stars the fairest I think," and he says that the line
 comes from Sappho's song to Hesperus. Again, he says, quoting:
 "Now thou didst appear like that fairest of all stars;
 for the Athenians call thee, Hesperus."</p>
 <p>Himerius also refers to an ode which was apparently an
 imitation of the work of Sappho.  The ode has been transcribed by
 J.A. Symonds.</p>

 <p>The Scholiast on Hesiod, Op. et D., 74, says that Sappho calls
 persausion, <tt>A?frodiths ðugate'ra</tt>.</p>

 <p>Athenaeus mentions <tt>Ba'rwmos</tt> and <tt>sa'rbitos</tt>, two stringed
 instruments in use in the time of Sappho. Their exact character is not
 known. He also gives the form <tt>Ba'rmos</tt> for the name of the former
 instrument.</p>
 
 <center><hr width="10%"></center>
 
 <p>A few single words or short phrases attributed to Sappho have
 been preserved here or there by various writers. Some examples
 may be given as they have a certain interest.</p>
 
 <p>Eustathius speaks of a "vagabond friendship, as Sappho would
 say," <tt>kalo`n dhmo'sion</tt>--"a public good."</p>
 
 <p>The "Lexicon Sequerianum" defines <tt>A?'kakos</tt> as meaning
 "without experience of ill," and says "so Sappho uses the word."</p>
 
 <p>The "Etymologicum Magnum" defines <tt>A?mamaksu's</tt> as a
 vine trained on poles, and says that Sappho makes the plural
 <tt>a?mam'ksudes</tt>. The same work mentions Sappho's use of the
 form <tt>au?'ws</tt> for <tt>h?'ws</tt>, "the dawn."</p>
 
 <p>Pollus says that Sappho used the word <tt>Beu^dos</tt> for a
 woman's dress.</p>
 
 <p>Phrynichus, the grammarian, says that Sappho calls a woman's dressing-case
 where she keeps her scents, <tt>gru'th</tt>.</p>
 
 <p>A Parisian manuscript (ed. Cramer) says: "Among the Aeolian <tt>z</tt>
 is used for <tt>d</tt>, as when Sappho says <tt>zabaton</tt> for
 <tt>dia'baton</tt>, 'fordable'."</p>
 
 <p>Cheoeroboscus says: "Sappho makes the accusative of <tt>ki'ndunos</tt>,
 danger, <tt>ki'ndun</tt>." Another writer says <tt>ki'nduna</tt>.</p>
 
 <p>Photius, in his Lexicon (ninth century) says: "<tt>ða'psos</tt>
 is a wood used to dye hair and wool yellow, which Sappho called
 <tt>ksu'lon Skuðiko'n</tt>, Scythian wood."</p>
 
 <p>The Fayum fragments in the Egyptian Museum in Berlin, brought
 there in 1879, contain among other things a very small scrap with
 a very imperfect text on both sides of it. The fragment is considered
 to be of the eight century A.D., and Professor Blass of Kiel
 ascribes the text to Sappho, judging by the metre and the dialect.
 There is a posthumous essay by Bergk on this subject in the fourth
 edition, 1882, of his "Poetae Lyrici Graeci," but the text of the
 fragments is so exceedingly imperfect that attempts at restoration
 are the merest conjectures.</p>
 
 <p>Finally, the following verse may be quoted:
 
 </p><blockquote>
 <pre>
 Kei^non a?^ xruso'ðrone Mou^s?, e?'nicpes
 u?'mnon e?k ta^s kalligu'naikos e?sðla^s
 Thios xw'ras o?'n a?ei'de terpnw^s pre'sbus a?gauo`s.
 </pre>
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>O Muse, golden throned, sing that strain which the revered
 elder of Teos, from the rich land of fair women, sang so melodiuosly.</p>
 
 <p>This verse was almost certainly not written by Sappho.
 Athenaeus says that "Hemesianax was mistaken when he represented
 Sappho and Anacreon as contemporaries, for Anacreon lived in the
 time of Cyrus and Polycrates [about 563-478 B.C.], while
 Sappho lived in the reign of Alyattes, father of Croesus."
 It is extremely improbable that Sappho was still living when
 Anacreon was born.</p>
