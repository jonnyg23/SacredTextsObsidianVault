 <p>The brook is nearly dry, the drying rushes perish in the mud; the air is burning, and far from the steep embankments a thin clear streamlet flows upon the sand.</p>
 <p>There it is from morn to night that little naked children come to play. They bathe, no higher than their calves, so sunken is the stream.</p>
 <p>But they tramp in the current and often slip upon the rocks, and little boys throw water upon little laughing girls.</p>
 <p>And when a company of passing merchants leads down their great white cattle to the sink, they cross their hands behind them, and watch the heavy beasts.</p>
