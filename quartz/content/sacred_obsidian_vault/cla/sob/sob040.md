 <h3 align="CENTER">BILITIS</h3>
 <p>One woman drapes herself in snowy wool. Another clothes herself in silk and gold. And still another hangs herself with flowers, green leaves and purple grapes.</p>
 <p>As for myself, I must live forever nude. My lover, come and take me as I am; without a dress or jewels or little boots, behold me! Bilitis herself and nothing more.</p>
 <p>My hair is black from its blackness, and my lips arc red from their red. My ringlets float about me free and loose and round as feathers.</p>
 <p>Take me as my mother made me in a distant night of love, and if I please you in that fashion, please do not forget to tell me so.</p>
