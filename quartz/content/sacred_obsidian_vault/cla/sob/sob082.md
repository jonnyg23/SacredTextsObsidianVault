 <p>Mnasidika's great eyes, how you delight me when desire darkens your lids and fires you and drowns you in its tears!</p>
 <p>How wild you make me when you turn aside, distracted by some passing lovely girl, or by a memory which is not my own.</p>
 <p>Then my cheeks grow hollow, my hands tremble and I suffer. . . It seems to me my life blood slips away, before your eyes, from every part of me.</p>
 <p>Mnasidika's great eyes, oh, do not cease to feast yourselves on me! or I'll prick you with my needle, and you'll see nothing but the dreadful night.</p>
