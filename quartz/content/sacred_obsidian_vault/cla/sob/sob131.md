 <h3 align="CENTER">ADVICE TO A LOVER</h3>
 <p>If you would be beloved of a woman, young friend, no matter what she may be, do not tell her you want her, but see that she sees you each day, and then disappear, to return.</p>
 <p>If she speaks to you, you may be amorous, without being eager at all. She will come to you, quite of herself. Know enough then to take her by force, the day she intends to give way.</p>
 <p>When you receive her in bed, neglect your own pleasure. The hands of an amorous woman are trembling and bear no caress. Excuse them from being active.</p>
 <p>But for yourself, no repose. Kiss her until you are breathless. Allow her no sleep, though she begs you. Always kiss that part of her body toward which she may turn her eyes.</p>
