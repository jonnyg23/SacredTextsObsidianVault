 <h3 align="CENTER">THE SEA OF KYPRIS</h3>
 <p>I had crouched on the edge of the highest promontory. The sea was black as a field of violets. And the Milky Way was gushing from the great supernal breast.</p>
 <p>About me a thousand Maenads slept in the torn-up flowers. Long grasses mingled with their flowing hair. And now the sun was born from the eastern waters.</p>
 <p>These the same waves and these the self-same shores that saw one day the white body of Aphrodite rising. . . I suddenly hid my eyes in my hands.</p>
 <p>For I had seen the water trembling with a thousand little lips of light: the pure sex, or it may have been the smile of Kypris Philommeïdes. <a href="sob154.htm#xref_121"><font size="1">121</font></a></p>
