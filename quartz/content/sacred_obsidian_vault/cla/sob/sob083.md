 <h3 align="CENTER">COSMETICS</h3>
 <p>Everything, my life and all the world., and men, all that is not she, is naught. All that is not she, I give you, passer-by.</p>
 <p>Does she know how many tasks I accomplish to be lovely in her eyes, tasks with my coiffure and my paints, my dresses and my perfumes?</p>
 <p>Just so long would I tread the mill, or pull the oar or even till the soil, if these would be the price of holding her.</p>
 <p>But never let her know these things, oh, guardian Goddesses! The very day she knows that I adore her, she'll seek another woman.</p>
