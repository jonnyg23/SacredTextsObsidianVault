 <h3 align="CENTER">SONG</h3>
 <p>The first one gave me a necklace, a necklace of pearls worth a city, with temples and palaces, treasures and slaves.</p>
 <p>The second wrote poetry for me. He said that my tresses were black as the night's, and my eyes were as blue as the day's.</p>
 <p>The third one was handsome; so handsome, that his mother would blush when she kissed him. He put his hands on my knees, and his lips he would press to my feet.</p>
 <p>You, you have said nothing to me. You have given me naught, being poor. And you are not overly handsome, but you are the one that I love.</p>
