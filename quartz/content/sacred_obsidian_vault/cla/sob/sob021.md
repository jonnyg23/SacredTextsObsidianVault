 <p>I am beloved by little children; when they see me come they run to me and tug upon my tunic, and grasp my legs about with tiny arms.</p>
 <p>If they have gathered flowers, all are mine; if they have caught a beetle, they place it in my hand; if they have nothing, they fondle me and make me sit before them.</p>
 <p>Then they kiss me on the cheek, they rest their little heads upon my breasts; they supplicate me with their shining eyes. How well I know just what they mean to say!</p>
 <p>They mean: "Bilitis sweet, tell us again, for we are good, the story of the hero Perseus, or else how little Helle met her death." <a href="sob154.htm#xref_39"><font size="1">39</font></a></p>
