 <h3 align="CENTER">THE TREE</h3>
 <p>I undressed to climb a tree; my naked thighs embraced the smooth and humid bark; my sandals climbed upon the branches.</p>
 <p>High up, but still beneath the leaves and shaded from the heat, I straddled a wide-spread fork and swung my feet into the void.</p>
 <p>It had rained. Drops of water fell and flowed upon my skin. My hands were soiled with moss and my heels were reddened by the crushed blossoms.</p>
 <p>I felt the lovely tree living when the wind passed through it; so I locked my legs tighter, and crushed my open lips to the hairy nape of a bough.</p>
