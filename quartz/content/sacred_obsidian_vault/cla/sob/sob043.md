 <h3 align="CENTER">SONG</h3>
 <p>"The night is so deep that it creeps between my eyelids. --You will never find the path. You'll be lost within the wood.</p>
 <p>--The noise of falling waters fills my ears. --You would not hear the murmurs of your lover though he should be but twenty steps away.</p>
 <p>--The odor of the flowers is so strong that I shall faint and fall upon the path. --You would not feel him should he cross your road.</p>
 <p>--Ah! though he is so far from here, across the very mountain, I see him and I hear him and I feel him touching me."</p>
