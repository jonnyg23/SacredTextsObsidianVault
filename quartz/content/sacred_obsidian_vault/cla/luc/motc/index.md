 Living at the height of the Roman Empire, the audience Lucian wrote for
 was hardly shocked by these short dialogues of the Greek <i>hetaerae</i>.
 However, two millenia of ensuing prudery made it impossible to acknowledge this
 part of the Lucian corpus, a set of humorous vignettes set in the
 context of the 'oldest profession,'
 let alone translate it into a vernacular language.
 These comedic sketches are timeless: working girls competing for
 clients, dishing gossip and candid tips of the trade,
 men trying to keep their girls' attention with expensive gifts.
 It also portrays the dark side of the <i>hetaera's</i> life:
 out-of-control parties, blowhard
 men, and putting up with rough treatment by clients.
 <p>
 Notably lacking is one modern reality.
 The <i>hetaerae</i> of Lucian are not constantly
 wondering whether their next client is going flash a badge and
 haul them off to jail.
 Sex workers in antiquity were another just legal occupation, like
 the butcher, the baker and the sandal maker.
 At that time, pagan temples throughout the eastern Mediterranean
 had sacred prostitutes, and patronizing them was considered
 a sanctified act.
 The <i>hetearae</i> actually had a lot more freedom than other
 women in Greek society, particularly the sequestered wives.
 </p>
 <p>
 With the dawn of the 20th century, it finally became feasible
 to publish English translations of the 'naughty bits' of Lucian.
 This one was published during the roaring 1920s in a
 deluxe art-deco illustrated version.
 The identity of the author is only known by the initials 'A.L.H.' on the
 Translator's Foreword page.
 </p>
 <p>
 This translation includes three chapters not included in the Fowler and Fowler
 translation, <a href="motc03.htm">The Education of Corinna</a>,
 <a href="motc09.htm">The Lesbians</a>,
 and <a href="motc17.htm">The Philosopher</a>.
 There are three gaps in the numbering of Fowler: V, VI and X, so these
 are probably the missing dialogues.
 The table on the left shows the correspondences between Fowler and this version.
 At issue here is the obviously the subject matter of these pieces:
 the first has a mother 'turning out' her daughter,
 the other two depict female and male homosexual characters respectively.
 However, they are far from explicit.
 It is an interesting to note that these were
 considered untranslatable in an academic edition in
 1905, but could be published in a popular edition in 1928.
 </p>
 <p>
 Bibliographic note:
 although the spine of this book says 'Dialogues of the Courtesans,'
 the title page and running headers use the title 'Mimes of the Courtesans.'
