   <h1 align="center">DIALOGUES OF THE GODS</h1>  <h3 align="center">XI</h3>  
 <p align="center"><i>Aphrodite. Selene</i></p>  
 <p><i>Aph</i>. What is this I hear about you, Selene? When your car is over Caria, you stop it to gaze at Endymion sleeping hunter-fashion in the open; sometimes, they tell me, you actually get out and go down to him.</p>  
 <p><i>Sel</i>. Ah, Aphrodite, ask that son of yours; it is he must answer for it all.</p>

 <p><i>Aph</i>. Well now, what a naughty boy! he gets his own mother into all sorts of scrapes; I must go down, now to Ida for Anchises of Troy, now to Lebanon for my Assyrian stripling;--mine? no, he put Persephone in love with him too, and so robbed me of half my darling. I have told him many a time that if he would not behave himself I would break his artillery for him, and clip his wings; and before now I have smacked his little behind with my slipper. It is no use; he is frightened and cries for a minute or two, and then forgets all about it. But tell me, is Endymion handsome? That is always a comfort in our humiliation.</p>  
 <p><i>Sel</i>. <i>Most</i> handsome, <i>I</i> think, my dear; you should see him when he has spread out his cloak on the rock and is asleep; his javelins in his left hand, just slipping from his grasp, the right arm bent upwards, making a bright frame to the face, and he breathing softly in helpless slumber. Then I come noiselessly down, treading on tiptoe not to wake and startle him--but there, you know all about it; why tell you the rest? I am dying of love, that is all.</p>
