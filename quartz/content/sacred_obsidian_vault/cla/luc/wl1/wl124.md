   <h1 align="center">DIALOGUES OF THE GODS</h1>  <h3 align="center">XVI</h3>  
 <p align="center"><i>Hera. Leto</i></p>  
 <p><i>Hera</i>. I must congratulate you, madam, on the children with whom you have presented Zeus.</p>  
 <p><i>Leto</i>. Ah, madam; we cannot all be the proud mothers of Hephaestuses.</p>  
 <p><i>Hera</i>. My boy may be a cripple, but at least he is of some use. He is a wonderful smith, and has made Heaven look another place; and Aphrodite thought him worth marrying,</p>

 <p>and dotes on him still. But those two of yours !--that girl is wild and mannish to a degree; and now she has gone off to Scythia, and her doings <i>there</i> are no secret; she is as bad as any Scythian herself,--butchering strangers and eating them! Apollo, too, who pretends to be so clever, with his bow and his lyre and his medicine and his prophecies; those oracle-shops that he has opened at Delphi, and Clarus, and Dindyma, are a cheat; he takes good care to be on the safe side by giving ambiguous answers that no one can understand, and makes money out of it, for there are plenty of fools who like being imposed upon,--but sensible people know well enough that most of it is clap-trap. The prophet did not know that he was to kill his favourite with a quoit; he never foresaw that Daphne would run away from him, so handsome as he is, too, such beautiful hair! I am not sure, after all, that there is much to choose between your children and Niobe's.</p>  
 <p><i>Leto</i>. Oh, of course; my children are butchers and impostors. I know how you hate the sight of them. You cannot bear to hear my girl complimented on her looks, or my boy's playing admired by the company.</p>  
 <p><i>Hera</i>. His playing, madam!--excuse a smile;--why, if the Muses had not favoured him, his contest with Marsyas would have cost him his skin; poor Marsyas was shamefully used on that occasion; ’twas a judicial murder.--As for your charming daughter, when Actaeon once caught sight of her charms, she had to set the dogs upon him, for fear he should tell all he knew: I forbear to ask where the innocent child picked up her knowledge of obstetrics.</p>  
 <p><i>Leto</i>. You set no small value on yourself, madam, because you are the wife of Zeus, and share his throne; you may insult whom you please. But there will be tears presently, when the next bull or swan sets out on his travels, and you are left neglected.</p>
