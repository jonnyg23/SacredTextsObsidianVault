   <h1 align="center">DIALOGUES OF THE DEAD</h1>  <h3 align="center">VIII</h3>  
 <p align="center"><i>Cnemon. Damnippus</i></p>  
 <p><i>Cne</i>. Why, ’tis the proverb fulfilled! The fawn hath taken the lion.</p>  
 <p><i>Dam</i>. What's the matter, Cnemon?</p>  
 <p><i>Cne</i>. The matter! I have been fooled, miserably fooled. I have passed over all whom I should have liked to make my heirs, and left my money to the wrong man.</p>  
 <p><i>Dam</i>. How was that?</p>  
 <p><i>Cne</i>. I had been speculating on the death of Hermolaus, the millionaire. He had no children, and my attentions had been well received by him. I thought it would be a good idea to let him know that I had made my will in his favour, on the chance of its exciting his emulation.</p>  
 <p><i>Dam</i>. Yes; and Hermolaus?</p>  
 <p><i>Cne</i>. What <i>his</i> will was, I don't know. I died suddenly,--the roof came down about my ears; and now Hermolaus is my heir. The pike has swallowed hook and bait.</p>

 <p><i>Dam</i>. And your anglership into the bargain. The pit that you digged for other. . . .</p>  
 <p><i>Cue</i>. That's about the truth of the matter, confound it.</p>
