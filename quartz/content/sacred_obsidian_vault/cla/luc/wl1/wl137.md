   <h1 align="center">DIALOGUES OF THE SEA-GODS</h1>  <h3 align="center">VI</h3>  
 <p align="center"><i>Triton. Posidon. Amymone</i></p>  
 <p><i>Tri</i>. Posidon, there is such a pretty girl coming to Lerna for water every day; I don't know that I ever saw a prettier.</p>  
 <p><i>Pos</i>. What is she, a lady? or a mere water-carrier?</p>  
 <p><i>Tri</i>. Oh no; she is one of the fifty daughters of that Egyptian king. Her name is Amymone; I asked about that and her family. Danaus understands discipline; he is bringing them up to do everything for themselves; they have to fetch water, and make themselves generally useful.</p>  
 <p><i>Pos</i>. And does she come all that way by herself, from Argos to Lerna?</p>  
 <p><i>Tri</i>. Yes; and Argos, you know, is a thirsty place; she is always having to get water.</p>  
 <p><i>Pos</i>. Triton, this is most exciting. We must go and see her.</p>  
 <p><i>Tri</i>. Very well. It is just her time now; I reckon she will be about half-way to Lerna.</p>  
 <p><i>Pos</i>. Bring out the chariot, then. Or no; it takes such a time getting it ready, and putting the horses to. Just fetch me out a good fast dolphin; that will be quickest.</p>  
 <p><i>Tri</i>. Here is a racer for you.</p>  
 <p><i>Pos</i>. Good; now let us be off. You swim alongside.--Here we are at Lerna. I'll lie in ambush hereabouts; and you keep a look-out. When you see her coming--</p>  
 <p><i>Tri</i>. Here she comes.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_97"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 97</font></a></p>  
 <p><i>Pos</i>. A charming child; the dawn of loveliness. We must carry her off.</p>  
 <p><i>Am</i>. Villain! where are you taking me to? You are a kidnapper. I know who sent you--my uncle Aegyptus. I shall call my father.</p>  
 <p><i>Tri</i>. Hush, Amymone; it is Posidon.</p>  
 <p><i>Am</i>. Posidon? What do you mean? Unhand me, villain! would you drag me into the sea? Help, help, I shall sink and be drowned.</p>  
 <p><i>Pos</i>. Don't be frightened; no harm shall be done to you. Come, you shall have a fountain called after you; it shall spring up in this very place, near the waves; I will strike the rock with my trident.--Think how nice it will be being dead, and not having to carry water any more, like all your sisters.</p>
