   <h1 align="center">DIALOGUES OF THE GODS</h1>  <h3 align="center">III</h3>  
 <p align="center"><i>Zeus. Hermes</i></p>  
 <p><i>Zeus</i>. Hermes, you know Inachus's beautiful daughter?</p>  
 <p><i>Her</i>. I do. Io, you mean?</p>  
 <p><i>Zeus</i>. Yes; she is not a girl now, but a heifer.</p>  
 <p><i>Her</i>. Magic at work! how did that come about?</p>  
 <p><i>Zeus</i>. Hera had a jealous fit, and transformed her. But that is not all; she has thought of a new punishment for the poor thing. She has put a cowherd in charge, who is all over eyes; this Argus, as he is called, pastures the heifer, and never goes to sleep.</p>  
 <p><i>Her</i>. Well, what am I to do?</p>  
 <p><i>Zeus</i>. Fly down to Nemea, where the pasture is, kill Argus, take Io across the sea to Egypt, and convert her into Isis. She shall be henceforth an Egyptian Goddess, flood the Nile, regulate the winds, and rescue mariners.</p>
