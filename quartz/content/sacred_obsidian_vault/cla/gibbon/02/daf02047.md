 <p>     The esteem of an enemy is most sincerely expressed by his fears; and the degree of fear may be accurately measured by the joy with which he celebrates his deliverance.  The welcome news of the death of Julian, which a deserter revealed to the camp of Sapor, inspired the desponding monarch with a sudden confidence of victory.  He immediately detached the royal cavalry, perhaps the ten thousand Immortals,  <a name="fr_1287"></a><a href="#fn_1286"><font size="1">104</font></a> to second and support the pursuit; and discharged the whole weight of his united forces on the rear- guard of the Romans.  The rear-guard was thrown into disorder; the renowned legions, which derived their titles from Diocletian, and his warlike colleague, were broke and trampled down by the elephants; and three tribunes lost their lives in attempting to stop the flight of their soldiers.  The battle was at length restored by the persevering valor of the Romans; the Persians were repulsed with a great slaughter of men and elephants; and the army, after marching and fighting a long summer's day, arrived, in the evening, at Samara, on the banks of the Tigris, about one hundred miles above Ctesiphon.  <a name="fr_1288"></a><a href="#fn_1287"><font size="1">105</font></a> On the ensuing day, the Barbarians, instead of harassing the march, attacked the camp, of Jovian; which had been seated in a deep and sequestered valley.  From the hills, the archers of Persia insulted and annoyed the wearied legionaries; and a body of cavalry, which had penetrated with desperate courage through the Praetorian gate, was cut in pieces, after a doubtful conflict, near the Imperial tent. In the succeeding night, the camp of Carche was protected by the lofty dikes of the river; and the Roman army, though incessantly exposed to the vexatious pursuit of the Saracens, pitched their tents near the city of Dura,  <a name="fr_1289"></a><a href="#fn_1288"><font size="1">106</font></a> four days after the death of Julian.  The Tigris was still on their left; their hopes and provisions were almost consumed; and the impatient soldiers, who had fondly persuaded themselves that the frontiers of the empire were not far distant, requested their new sovereign, that they might be permitted to hazard the passage of the river.  With the assistance of his wisest officers, Jovian endeavored to check their rashness; by representing, that if they possessed sufficient skill and vigor to stem the torrent of a deep and rapid stream, they would only deliver themselves naked and defenceless to the Barbarians, who had occupied the opposite banks, Yielding at length to their clamorous importunities, he consented, with reluctance, that five hundred Gauls and Germans, accustomed from their infancy to the waters of the Rhine and Danube, should attempt the bold adventure, which might serve either as an encouragement, or as a warning, for the rest of the army.  In the silence of the night, they swam the Tigris, surprised an unguarded post of the enemy, and displayed at the dawn of day the signal of their resolution and fortune.  The success of this trial disposed the emperor to listen to the promises of his architects, who propose to construct a floating bridge of the inflated skins of sheep, oxen, and goats, covered with a floor of earth and fascines.  <a name="fr_1290"></a><a href="#fn_1289"><font size="1">107</font></a> Two important days were spent in the ineffectual labor; and the Romans, who already endured the miseries of famine, cast a look of despair on the Tigris, and upon the Barbarians; whose numbers and obstinacy increased with the distress of the Imperial army.  <a name="fr_1291"></a><a href="#fn_1290"><font size="1">108</font></a> </p>

 <p>     In this hopeless condition, the fainting spirits of the Romans were revived by the sound of peace.  The transient presumption of Sapor had vanished: he observed, with serious concern, that, in the repetition of doubtful combats, he had lost his most faithful and intrepid nobles, his bravest troops, and the greatest part of his train of elephants: and the experienced monarch feared to provoke the resistance of despair, the vicissitudes of fortune, and the unexhausted powers of the Roman empire; which might soon advance to elieve, or to revenge, the successor of Julian. The Surenas himself, accompanied by another satrap,  <a name="fr_1292"></a><a href="#fn_1292"><font size="1">*_0069</font></a> appeared in the camp of Jovian;  <a name="fr_1293"></a><a href="#fn_1291"><font size="1">109</font></a> and declared, that the clemency of his sovereign was not averse to signify the conditions on which he would consent to spare and to dismiss the Caesar with the relics of his captive army.  <a name="fr_1294"></a><a href="#fn_1293"><font size="1">!_0069</font></a> The hopes of safety subdued the firmness of the Romans; the emperor was compelled, by the advice of his council, and the cries of his soldiers, to embrace the offer of peace;  <a name="fr_1295"></a><a href="#fn_1294"><font size="1">!!_0069</font></a> and the praefect Sallust was immediately sent, with the general Arinthaeus, to understand the pleasure of the Great King.  The crafty Persian delayed, under various pretenses, the conclusion of the agreement; started difficulties, required explanations, suggested expedients, receded from his concessions, increased his demands, and wasted four days in the arts of negotiation, till he had consumed the stock of provisions which yet remained in the camp of the Romans.  Had Jovian been capable of executing a bold and prudent measure, he would have continued his march, with unremitting diligence; the progress of the treaty would have suspended the attacks of the Barbarians; and, before the expiration of the fourth day, he might have safely reached the fruitful province of Corduene, at the distance only of one hundred miles.  <a name="fr_1296"></a><a href="#fn_1295"><font size="1">110</font></a> The irresolute emperor, instead of breaking through the toils of the enemy, expected his fate with patient resignation; and accepted the humiliating conditions of peace, which it was no longer in his power to refuse.  The five provinces beyond the Tigris, which had been ceded by the grandfather of Sapor, were restored to the Persian monarchy.  He acquired, by a single article, the impregnable city of Nisibis; which had sustained, in three successive sieges, the effort of his arms.  Singara, and the castle of the Moors, one of the strongest places of Mesopotamia, were likewise dismembered from the empire. It was considered as an indulgence, that the inhabitants of those fortresses were permitted to retire with their effects; but the conqueror rigorously insisted, that the Romans should forever abandon the king and kingdom of Armenia.  <a name="fr_1297"></a><a href="#fn_1296"><font size="1">!!!_0069</font></a> A peace, or rather a long truce, of thirty years, was stipulated between the hostile nations; the faith of the treaty was ratified by solemn oaths and religious ceremonies; and hostages of distinguished rank were reciprocally delivered to secure the performance of the conditions.  <a name="fr_1298"></a><a href="#fn_1297"><font size="1">111</font></a>

 <p>     The sophist of Antioch, who saw with indignation the sceptre of his hero in the feeble hand of a Christian successor, professes to admire the moderation of Sapor, in contenting himself with so small a portion of the Roman empire.  If he had stretched as far as the Euphrates the claims of his ambition, he might have been secure, says Libanius, of not meeting with a refusal.  If he had fixed, as the boundary of Persia, the Orontes, the Cydnus, the Sangarius, or even the Thracian Bosphorus, flatterers would not have been wanting in the court of Jovian to convince the timid monarch, that his remaining provinces would still afford the most ample gratifications of power and luxury.  <a name="fr_1299"></a><a href="#fn_1298"><font size="1">112</font></a> Without adopting in its full force this malicious insinuation, we must acknowledge, that the conclusion of so ignominious a treaty was facilitated by the private ambition of Jovian. The obscure domestic, exalted to the throne by fortune, rather than by merit, was impatient to escape from the hands of the Persians, that he might prevent the designs of Procopius, who commanded the army of Mesopotamia, and establish his doubtful reign over the legions and provinces which were still ignorant of the hasty and tumultuous choice of the camp beyond the Tigris.  <a name="fr_1300"></a><a href="#fn_1299"><font size="1">113</font></a> In the neighborhood of the same river, at no very considerable distance from the fatal station of Dura,  <a name="fr_1301"></a><a href="#fn_1300"><font size="1">114</font></a> the ten thousand Greeks, without generals, or guides, or provisions, were abandoned, above twelve hundred miles from their native country, to the resentment of a victorious monarch.  The difference of their conduct and success depended much more on their character than on their situation. Instead of tamely resigning themselves to the secret deliberations and private views of a single person, the united councils of the Greeks were inspired by the generous enthusiasm of a popular assembly; where the mind of each citizen is filled with the love of glory, the pride of freedom, and the contempt of death.  Conscious of their superiority over the Barbarians in arms and discipline, they disdained to yield, they refused to capitulate: every obstacle was surmounted by their patience, courage, and military skill; and the memorable retreat of the ten thousand exposed and insulted the weakness of the Persian monarchy.  <a name="fr_1302"></a><a href="#fn_1301"><font size="1">115</font></a> </p>

        As the price of his disgraceful concessions, the emperor might perhaps have stipulated, that the camp of the hungry Romans should be plentifully supplied;  <a name="fr_1303"></a><a href="#fn_1302"><font size="1">116</font></a> and that they should be permitted to pass the Tigris on the bridge which was constructed by the hands of the Persians.  But, if Jovian presumed to solicit those equitable terms, they were sternly refused by the haughty tyrant of the East, whose clemency had pardoned the invaders of his country.  The Saracens sometimes intercepted the stragglers of the march; but the generals and troops of Sapor respected the cessation of arms; and Jovian was suffered to explore the most convenient place for the passage of the river.  The small vessels, which had been saved from the conflagration of the fleet, performed the most essential service.  They first conveyed the emperor and his favorites; and afterwards transported, in many successive voyages, a great part of the army.  But, as every man was anxious for his personal safety, and apprehensive of being left on the hostile shore, the soldiers, who were too impatient to wait the slow returns of the boats, boldly ventured themselves on light hurdles, or inflated skins; and, drawing after them their horses, attempted, with various success, to swim across the river.  Many of these daring adventurers were swallowed by the waves; many others, who were carried along by the violence of the stream, fell an easy prey to the avarice or cruelty of the wild Arabs: and the loss which the army sustained in the passage of the Tigris, was not inferior to the carnage of a day of battle. As soon as the Romans were landed on the western bank, they were delivered from the hostile pursuit of the Barbarians; but, in a laborious march of two hundred miles over the plains of Mesopotamia, they endured the last extremities of thirst and hunger.  They were obliged to traverse the sandy desert, which, in the extent of seventy miles, did not afford a single blade of sweet grass, nor a single spring of fresh water; and the rest of the inhospitable waste was untrod by the footsteps either of friends or enemies. Whenever a small measure of flour could be discovered in the camp, twenty pounds weight were greedily purchased with ten pieces of gold:  <a name="fr_1304"></a><a href="#fn_1303"><font size="1">117</font></a> the beasts of burden were slaughtered and devoured; and the desert was strewed with the arms and baggage of the Roman soldiers, whose tattered garments and meagre countenances displayed their past sufferings and actual misery.  A small convoy of provisions advanced to meet the army as far as the castle of Ur; and the supply was the more grateful, since it declared the fidelity of Sebastian and Procopius.  At Thilsaphata,  <a name="fr_1305"></a><a href="#fn_1304"><font size="1">118</font></a> the emperor most graciously received the generals of Mesopotamia; and the remains of a once flourishing army at length reposed themselves under the walls of Nisibis.  The messengers of Jovian had already proclaimed, in the language of flattery, his election, his treaty, and his return; and the new prince had taken the most effectual measures to secure the allegiance of the armies and provinces of Europe, by placing the military command in the hands of those officers, who, from motives of interest, or inclination, would firmly support the cause of their benefactor.  <a name="fr_1306"></a><a href="#fn_1306"><font size="1">119</font></a>

        The friends of Julian had confidently announced the success of his expedition.  They entertained a fond persuasion that the temples of the gods would be enriched with the spoils of the East; that Persia would be reduced to the humble state of a tributary province, governed by the laws and magistrates of Rome; that the Barbarians would adopt the dress, and manners, and language of their conquerors; and that the youth of Ecbatana and Susa would study the art of rhetoric under Grecian masters.  <a name="fr_1308"></a><a href="#fn_1307"><font size="1">120</font></a> The progress of the arms of Julian interrupted his communication with the empire; and, from the moment that he passed the Tigris, his affectionate subjects were ignorant of the fate and fortunes of their prince.  Their contemplation of fancied triumphs was disturbed by the melancholy rumor of his death; and they persisted to doubt, after they could no longer deny, the truth of that fatal event.  <a name="fr_1309"></a><a href="#fn_1308"><font size="1">121</font></a> The messengers of Jovian promulgated the specious tale of a prudent and necessary peace; the voice of fame, louder and more sincere, revealed the disgrace of the emperor, and the conditions of the ignominious treaty.  The minds of the people were filled with astonishment and grief, with indignation and terror, when they were informed, that the unworthy successor of Julian relinquished the five provinces which had been acquired by the victory of Galerius; and that he shamefully surrendered to the Barbarians the important city of Nisibis, the firmest bulwark of the provinces of the East.  <a name="fr_1310"></a><a href="#fn_1309"><font size="1">122</font></a> The deep and dangerous question, how far the public faith should be observed, when it becomes incompatible with the public safety, was freely agitated in popular conversation; and some hopes were entertained that the emperor would redeem his pusillanimous behavior by a splendid act of patriotic perfidy.  The inflexible spirit of the Roman senate had always disclaimed the unequal conditions which were extorted from the distress of their captive armies; and, if it were necessary to satisfy the national honor, by delivering the guilty general into the hands of the Barbarians, the greatest part of the subjects of Jovian would have cheerfully acquiesced in the precedent of ancient times.  <a name="fr_1311"></a><a href="#fn_1310"><font size="1">123</font></a> </p>

 <p>     But the emperor, whatever might be the limits of his constitutional authority, was the absolute master of the laws and arms of the state; and the same motives which had forced him to subscribe, now pressed him to execute, the treaty of peace.  He was impatient to secure an empire at the expense of a few provinces; and the respectable names of religion and honor concealed the personal fears and ambition of Jovian.  Notwithstanding the dutiful solicitations of the inhabitants, decency, as well as prudence, forbade the emperor to lodge in the palace of Nisibis; but the next morning after his arrival.  Bineses, the ambassador of Persia, entered the place, displayed from the citadel the standard of the Great King, and proclaimed, in his name, the cruel alternative of exile or servitude.  The principal citizens of Nisibis, who, till that fatal moment, had confided in the protection of their sovereign, threw themselves at his feet.  They conjured him not to abandon, or, at least, not to deliver, a faithful colony to the rage of a Barbarian tyrant, exasperated by the three successive defeats which he had experienced under the walls of Nisibis.  They still possessed arms and courage to repel the invaders of their country: they requested only the permission of using them in their own defence; and, as soon as they had asserted their independence, they should implore the favor of being again admitted into the ranks of his subjects.  Their arguments, their eloquence, their tears, were ineffectual.  Jovian alleged, with some confusion, the sanctity of oaths; and, as the reluctance with which he accepted the present of a crown of gold, convinced the citizens of their hopeless condition, the advocate Sylvanus was provoked to exclaim, "O emperor!  may you thus be crowned by all the cities of your dominions!" Jovian, who in a few weeks had assumed the habits of a prince,  <a name="fr_1312"></a><a href="#fn_1311"><font size="1">124</font></a> was displeased with freedom, and offended with truth: and as he reasonably supposed, that the discontent of the people might incline them to submit to the Persian government, he published an edict, under pain of death, that they should leave the city within the term of three days.  Ammianus has delineated in lively colors the scene of universal despair, which he seems to have viewed with an eye of compassion.  <a name="fr_1313"></a><a href="#fn_1312"><font size="1">125</font></a> The martial youth deserted, with indignant grief, the walls which they had so gloriously defended: the disconsolate mourner dropped a last tear over the tomb of a son or husband, which must soon be profaned by the rude hand of a Barbarian master; and the aged citizen kissed the threshold, and clung to the doors, of the house where he had passed the cheerful and careless hours of infancy.  The highways were crowded with a trembling multitude: the distinctions of rank, and sex, and age, were lost in the general calamity.  Every one strove to bear away some fragment from the wreck of his fortunes; and as they could not command the immediate service of an adequate number of horses or wagons, they were obliged to leave behind them the greatest part of their valuable effects.  The savage insensibility of Jovian appears to have aggravated the hardships of these unhappy fugitives.  They were seated, however, in a new-built quarter of Amida; and that rising city, with the reenforcement of a very considerable colony, soon recovered its former splendor, and became the capital of Mesopotamia.  <a name="fr_1314"></a><a href="#fn_1313"><font size="1">126</font></a> Similar orders were despatched by the emperor for the evacuation of Singara and the castle of the Moors; and for the restitution of the five provinces beyond the Tigris. Sapor enjoyed the glory and the fruits of his victory; and this ignominious peace has justly been considered as a memorable aera in the decline and fall of the Roman empire.  The predecessors of Jovian had sometimes relinquished the dominion of distant and unprofitable provinces; but, since the foundation of the city, the genius of Rome, the god Terminus, who guarded the boundaries of the republic, had never retired before the sword of a victorious enemy.  <a name="fr_1315"></a><a href="#fn_1314"><font size="1">127</font></a> </p> 
 <p>
  </p> 
 <p>
   
  </p> 
 <p>
  </p> 
 <p>     After Jovian had performed those engagements which the voice of his people might have tempted him to violate, he hastened away from the scene of his disgrace, and proceeded with his whole court to enjoy the luxury of Antioch.  <a name="fr_1316"></a><a href="#fn_1315"><font size="1">128</font></a> Without consulting the dictates of religious zeal, he was prompted, by humanity and gratitude, to bestow the last honors on the remains of his deceased sovereign:  <a name="fr_1317"></a><a href="#fn_1316"><font size="1">129</font></a> and Procopius, who sincerely bewailed the loss of his kinsman, was removed from the command of the army, under the decent pretence of conducting the funeral.  The corpse of Julian was transported from Nisibis to Tarsus, in a slow march of fifteen days; and, as it passed through the cities of the East, was saluted by the hostile factions, with mournful lamentations and clamorous insults.  The Pagans already placed their beloved hero in the rank of those gods whose worship he had restored; while the invectives of the Christians pursued the soul of the Apostate to hell, and his body to the grave.  <a name="fr_1318"></a><a href="#fn_1317"><font size="1">130</font></a> One party lamented the approaching ruin of their altars; the other celebrated the marvellous deliverance of their church.  The Christians applauded, in lofty and ambiguous strains, the stroke of divine vengeance, which had been so long suspended over the guilty head of Julian. They acknowledge, that the death of the tyrant, at the instant he expired beyond the Tigris, was revealed to the saints of Egypt, Syria, and Cappadocia;  <a name="fr_1319"></a><a href="#fn_1318"><font size="1">131</font></a> and instead of suffering him to fall by the Persian darts, their indiscretion ascribed the heroic deed to the obscure hand of some mortal or immortal champion of the faith.  <a name="fr_1320"></a><a href="#fn_1319"><font size="1">132</font></a> Such imprudent declarations were eagerly adopted by the malice, or credulity, of their adversaries;  <a name="fr_1321"></a><a href="#fn_1320"><font size="1">133</font></a> who darkly insinuated, or confidently asserted, that the governors of the church had instigated and directed the fanaticism of a domestic assassin.  <a name="fr_1322"></a><a href="#fn_1321"><font size="1">134</font></a> Above sixteen years after the death of Julian, the charge was solemnly and vehemently urged, in a public oration, addressed by Libanius to the emperor Theodosius.  His suspicions are unsupported by fact or argument; and we can only esteem the generous zeal of the sophist of Antioch for the cold and neglected ashes of his friend.  <a name="fr_1323"></a><a href="#fn_1322"><font size="1">135</font></a> </p>

 <p>     It was an ancient custom in the funerals, as well as in the triumphs, of the Romans, that the voice of praise should be corrected by that of satire and ridicule; and that, in the midst of the splendid pageants, which displayed the glory of the living or of the dead, their imperfections should not be concealed from the eyes of the world.  <a name="fr_1324"></a><a href="#fn_1323"><font size="1">136</font></a> This custom was practised in the funeral of Julian.  The comedians, who resented his contempt and aversion for the theatre, exhibited, with the applause of a Christian audience, the lively and exaggerated representation of the faults and follies of the deceased emperor.  His various character and singular manners afforded an ample scope for pleasantry and ridicule.  <a name="fr_1325"></a><a href="#fn_1324"><font size="1">137</font></a> In the exercise of his uncommon talents, he often descended below the majesty of his rank.  Alexander was transformed into Diogenes; the philosopher was degraded into a priest.  The purity of his virtue was sullied by excessive vanity; his superstition disturbed the peace, and endangered the safety, of a mighty empire; and his irregular sallies were the less entitled to indulgence, as they appeared to be the laborious efforts of art, or even of affectation.  The remains of Julian were interred at Tarsus in Cilicia; but his stately tomb, which arose in that city, on the banks of the cold and limpid Cydnus,  <a name="fr_1326"></a><a href="#fn_1325"><font size="1">138</font></a> was displeasing to the faithful friends, who loved and revered the memory of that extraordinary man.  The philosopher expressed a very reasonable wish, that the disciple of Plato might have reposed amidst the groves of the academy;  <a name="fr_1327"></a><a href="#fn_1326"><font size="1">139</font></a> while the soldier exclaimed, in bolder accents, that the ashes of Julian should have been mingled with those of Caesar, in the field of Mars, and among the ancient monuments of Roman virtue.  <a name="fr_1328"></a><a href="#fn_1327"><font size="1">140</font></a> The history of princes does not very frequently renew the examples of a similar competition. </p>

The king of Persia was then in Persarmenia, ignorant of the death of Julian; he only arrived at the army subsequent to that event. St. Martin adopts this view, and finds or extorts support for it, from Libanius and Ammianus, iii. 158. - M.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1295"></a><a href="daf02047.htm#fr_1296">110</a> It is presumptuous to controvert the opinion of Ammianus, a soldier and a spectator.  Yet it is difficult to understand how the mountains of Corduene could extend over the plains of Assyria, as low as the conflux of the Tigris and the great Zab; or how an army of sixty thousand men could march one hundred miles in four days. </p> 
 <p>     Note: Yet this appears to be the case (in modern maps: ) the march is the difficulty. - M.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1296"></a><a href="daf02047.htm#fr_1297">!!!_0069</a> Sapor availed himself, a few years after, of the dissolution of the alliance between the Romans and the Armenians.  See St. M. iii. 163. - M.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1297"></a><a href="daf02047.htm#fr_1298">111</a> The treaty of Dura is recorded with grief or indignation by Ammianus, (xxv. 7,) Libanius, (Orat. Parent. c. 142, p. 364,) Zosimus, (l. iii. p. 190, 191,) Gregory Nazianzen, (Orat. iv. p. 117, 118, who imputes the distress to Julian, the deliverance to Jovian,) and Eutropius, (x. 17.) The last-mentioned writer, who was present in military station, styles this peace necessarium quidem sed ignoblem.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1298"></a><a href="daf02047.htm#fr_1299">112</a> Libanius, Orat. Parent. c. 143, p. 364, 365.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1299"></a><a href="daf02047.htm#fr_1300">113</a> Conditionibus . . . . . dispendiosis Romanae reipublicae impositis . . . . quibus cupidior regni quam gloriae Jovianus, imperio rudis, adquievit.  Sextus Rufus de Provinciis, c. 29.  La Bleterie has expressed, in a long, direct oration, these specious considerations of public and private interest, (Hist. de Jovien, tom. i. p. 39, &amp;c.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1300"></a><a href="daf02047.htm#fr_1301">114</a> The generals were murdered on the bauks of the Zabatus, (Ana basis, l. ii. p. 156, l. iii. p. 226,) or great Zab, a river of Assyria, 400 feet broad, which falls into the Tigris fourteen hours below Mosul. The error of the Greeks bestowed on the greater and lesser Zab the names of the Walf, (Lycus,) and the Goat, (Capros.) They created these animals to attend the Tiger of the East.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1301"></a><a href="daf02047.htm#fr_1302">115</a> The Cyropoedia is vague and languid; the Anabasis circumstance and animated.  Such is the eternal difference between fiction and truth.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1302"></a><a href="daf02047.htm#fr_1303">116</a> According to Rufinus, an immediate supply of provisions was stipulated by the treaty, and Theodoret affirms, that the obligation was faithfully discharged by the Persians.  Such a fact is probable but undoubtedly false.  See Tillemont, Hist. des Empereurs, tom. iv. p. 702.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1303"></a><a href="daf02047.htm#fr_1304">117</a> We may recollect some lines of Lucan, (Pharsal. iv. 95,) who describes a similar distress of Caesar's army in Spain: - </p> 
 <p>     Saeva fames aderat -      Miles eget: toto censu non prodigus emit      Exiguam Cererem.  Proh lucri pallida tabes!      Non deest prolato jejunus venditor auro. </p> 
 <p>See Guichardt (Nouveaux Memoires Militaires, tom. i. p. 370-382.) His analysis of the two campaigns in Spain and Africa is the noblest monument that has ever been raised to the fame of Caesar.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1304"></a><a href="daf02047.htm#fr_1305">118</a> M. d'Anville (see his Maps, and l'Euphrate et le Tigre, p. 92, 93) traces their march, and assigns the true position of Hatra, Ur, and Thilsaphata, which Ammianus has mentioned.  <a name="fr_1307"></a><a href="#fn_1305"><font size="1">*_0070</font></a> He does not complain of the Samiel, the deadly hot wind, which Thevenot (Voyages, part ii. l. i. p. 192) so much dreaded.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1305"></a><a href="daf02047.htm#fr_1307">*_0070</a> Hatra, now Kadhr.  Ur, Kasr or Skervidgi.  Thilsaphata is unknown - M.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1306"></a><a href="daf02047.htm#fr_1306">119</a> The retreat of Jovian is described by Ammianus, (xxv. 9,) Libanius, (Orat. Parent. c. 143, p. 365,) and Zosimus, (l. iii. p. 194.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1307"></a><a href="daf02047.htm#fr_1308">120</a> Libanius, (Orat. Parent. c. 145, p. 366.) Such were the natural hopes and wishes of a rhetorician.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1308"></a><a href="daf02047.htm#fr_1309">121</a> The people of Carrhae, a city devoted to Paganism, buried the inauspicious messenger under a pile of stones, (Zosimus, l. iii. p. 196.) Libanius, when he received the fatal intelligence, cast his eye on his sword; but he recollected that Plato had condemned suicide, and that he must live to compose the Panegyric of Julian, (Libanius de Vita sua, tom. ii. p. 45, 46.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1309"></a><a href="daf02047.htm#fr_1310">122</a> Ammianus and Eutropius may be admitted as fair and credible witnesses of the public language and opinions.  The people of Antioch reviled an ignominious peace, which exposed them to the Persians, on a naked and defenceless frontier, (Excerpt. Valesiana, p. 845, ex Johanne Antiocheno.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1310"></a><a href="daf02047.htm#fr_1311">123</a> The Abbe de la Bleterie, (Hist. de Jovien, tom. i. p. 212- 227.) though a severe casuist, has pronounced that Jovian was not bound to execute his promise; since he could not dismember the empire, nor alienate, without their consent, the allegiance of his people.  I have never found much delight or instruction in such political metaphysics.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1311"></a><a href="daf02047.htm#fr_1312">124</a> At Nisibis he performed a royal act.  A brave officer, his namesake, who had been thought worthy of the purple, was dragged from supper, thrown into a well, and stoned to death without any form of trial or evidence of guilt.  Anomian. xxv. 8.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1312"></a><a href="daf02047.htm#fr_1313">125</a> See xxv. 9, and Zosimus, l. iii. p. 194, 195.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1313"></a><a href="daf02047.htm#fr_1314">126</a> Chron. Paschal. p. 300.  The ecclesiastical Notitie may be consulted.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1314"></a><a href="daf02047.htm#fr_1315">127</a> Zosimus, l. iii. p. 192, 193.  Sextus Rufus de Provinciis, c. 29.  Augustin de Civitat. Dei, l. iv. c. 29.  This general position must be applied and interpreted with some caution.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1315"></a><a href="daf02047.htm#fr_1316">128</a> Ammianus, xxv. 9.  Zosimus, l. iii. p. 196.  He might be edax, vino Venerique indulgens.  But I agree with La Bleterie (tom. i. p. 148-154) in rejecting the foolish report of a Bacchanalian riot (ap. Suidam) celebrated at Antioch, by the emperor, his wife, and a troop of concubines.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1316"></a><a href="daf02047.htm#fr_1317">129</a> The Abbe de la Bleterie (tom. i. p. 156-209) handsomely exposes the brutal bigotry of Baronius, who would have thrown Julian to the dogs, ne cespititia quidem sepultura dignus.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1317"></a><a href="daf02047.htm#fr_1318">130</a> Compare the sophist and the saint, (Libanius, Monod. tom. ii. p. 251, and Orat. Parent. c. 145, p. 367, c. 156, p. 377, with Gregory Nazianzen, Orat. iv. p. 125-132.) The Christian orator faintly mutters some exhortations to modesty and forgiveness; but he is well satisfied, that the real sufferings of Julian will far exceed the fabulous torments of Ixion or Tantalus.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1318"></a><a href="daf02047.htm#fr_1319">131</a> Tillemont (Hist. des Empereurs, tom. iv. p. 549) has collected these visions.  Some saint or angel was observed to be absent in the night, on a secret expedition, &amp;c.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1319"></a><a href="daf02047.htm#fr_1320">132</a> Sozomen (l. vi. 2) applauds the Greek doctrine of tyrannicide; but the whole passage, which a Jesuit might have translated, is prudently suppressed by the president Cousin.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1320"></a><a href="daf02047.htm#fr_1321">133</a> Immediately after the death of Julian, an uncertain rumor was scattered, telo cecidisse Romano.  It was carried, by some deserters to the Persian camp; and the Romans were reproached as the assassins of the emperor by Sapor and his subjects, (Ammian. xxv. 6. Libanius de ulciscenda Juliani nece, c. xiii. p. 162, 163.) It was urged, as a decisive proof, that no Persian had appeared to claim the promised reward, (Liban. Orat. Parent. c. 141, p. 363.) But the flying horseman, who darted the fatal javelin, might be ignorant of its effect; or he might be slain in the same action.  Ammianus neither feels nor inspires a suspicion.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1321"></a><a href="daf02047.htm#fr_1322">134</a> This dark and ambiguous expression may point to Athanasius, the first, without a rival, of the Christian clergy, (Libanius de ulcis. Jul. nece, c. 5, p. 149.  La Bleterie, Hist. de Jovien, tom. i. p. 179.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1322"></a><a href="daf02047.htm#fr_1323">135</a> The orator (Fabricius, Bibliot. Graec. tom. vii. p. 145-179) scatters suspicions, demands an inquiry, and insinuates, that proofs might still be obtained.  He ascribes the success of the Huns to the criminal neglect of revenging Julian's death.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1323"></a><a href="daf02047.htm#fr_1324">136</a> At the funeral of Vespasian, the comedian who personated that frugal emperor, anxiously inquired how much it cost.  Fourscore thousand pounds, (centies.) Give me the tenth part of the sum, and throw my body into the Tiber.  Sueton, in Vespasian, c. 19, with the notes of Casaubon and Gronovius.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1324"></a><a href="daf02047.htm#fr_1325">137</a> Gregory (Orat. iv. p. 119, 120) compares this supposed ignominy and ridicule to the funeral honors of Constantius, whose body was chanted over Mount Taurus by a choir of angels.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1325"></a><a href="daf02047.htm#fr_1326">138</a> Quintus Curtius, l. iii. c. 4.  The luxuriancy of his descriptions has been often censured.  Yet it was almost the duty of the historian to describe a river, whose waters had nearly proved fatal to Alexander.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1326"></a><a href="daf02047.htm#fr_1327">139</a> Libanius, Orat. Parent. c. 156, p. 377.  Yet he acknowledges with gratitude the liberality of the two royal brothers in decorating the tomb of Julian, (de ulcis. Jul. nece, c. 7, p. 152.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1327"></a><a href="daf02047.htm#fr_1328">140</a> Cujus suprema et cineres, si qui tunc juste consuleret, non Cydnus videre deberet, quamvis gratissimus amnis et liquidus: sed ad perpetuandam gloriam recte factorum praeterlambere Tiberis, intersecans urbem aeternam, divorumque veterum monumenta praestringens Ammian. xxv. 10.</p>
