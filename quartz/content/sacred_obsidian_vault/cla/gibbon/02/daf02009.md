 <p>     Foundation Of Constantinople. - Political System Constantine, And His Successors. - Military Discipline. - The Palace. - The Finances.  </p> 
 <p>     The unfortunate Licinius was the last rival who opposed the greatness, and the last captive who adorned the triumph, of Constantine.  After a tranquil and prosperous reign, the conquerer bequeathed to his family the inheritance of the Roman empire; a new capital, a new policy, and a new religion; and the innovations which he established have been embraced and consecrated by succeeding generations.  The age of the great Constantine and his sons is filled with important events; but the historian must be oppressed by their number and variety, unless he diligently separates from each other the scenes which are connected only by the order of time.  He will describe the political institutions that gave strength and stability to the empire, before he proceeds to relate the wars and revolutions which hastened its decline.  He will adopt the division unknown to the ancients of civil and ecclesiastical affairs: the victory of the Christians, and their intestine discord, will supply copious and distinct materials both for edification and for scandal. </p> 
 <p>     After the defeat and abdication of Licinius, his victorious rival proceeded to lay the foundations of a city destined to reign in future times, the mistress of the East, and to survive the empire and religion of Constantine.  The motives, whether of pride or of policy, which first induced Diocletian to withdraw himself from the ancient seat of government, had acquired additional weight by the example of his successors, and the habits of forty years.  Rome was insensibly confounded with the dependent kingdoms which had once acknowledged her supremacy; and the country of the Caesars was viewed with cold indifference by a martial prince, born in the neighborhood of the Danube, educated in the courts and armies of Asia, and invested with the purple by the legions of Britain.  The Italians, who had received Constantine as their deliverer, submissively obeyed the edicts which he sometimes condescended to address to the senate and people of Rome; but they were seldom honored with the presence of their new sovereign.  During the vigor of his age, Constantine, according to the various exigencies of peace and war, moved with slow dignity, or with active diligence, along the frontiers of his extensive dominions; and was always prepared to take the field either against a foreign or a domestic enemy.  But as he gradually reached the summit of prosperity and the decline of life, he began to meditate the design of fixing in a more permanent station the strength as well as majesty of the throne.  In the choice of an advantageous situation, he preferred the confines of Europe and Asia; to curb with a powerful arm the barbarians who dwelt between the Danube and the Tanais; to watch with an eye of jealousy the conduct of the Persian monarch, who indignantly supported the yoke of an ignominious treaty. With these views, Diocletian had selected and embellished the residence of Nicomedia: but the memory of Diocletian was justly abhorred by the protector of the church: and Constantine was not insensible to the ambition of founding a city which might perpetuate the glory of his own name.  During the late operations of the war against Licinius, he had sufficient opportunity to contemplate, both as a soldier and as a statesman, the incomparable position of Byzantium; and to observe how strongly it was guarded by nature against a hostile attack, whilst it was accessible on every side to the benefits of commercial intercourse.  Many ages before Constantine, one of the most judicious historians of antiquity  <a name="fr_212"></a><a href="#fn_212"><font size="1">1</font></a> had described the advantages of a situation, from whence a feeble colony of Greeks derived the command of the sea, and the honors of a flourishing and independent republic.  <a name="fr_213"></a><a href="#fn_213"><font size="1">2</font></a>  
   
        If we survey Byzantium in the extent which it acquired with the august name of Constantinople, the figure of the Imperial city may be represented under that of an unequal triangle.  The obtuse point, which advances towards the east and the shores of Asia, meets and repels the waves of the Thracian Bosphorus.  The northern side of the city is bounded by the harbor; and the southern is washed by the Propontis, or Sea of Marmara. The basis of the triangle is opposed to the west, and terminates the continent of Europe.  But the admirable form and division of the circumjacent land and water cannot, without a more ample explanation, be clearly or sufficiently understood.       The winding channel through which the waters of the Euxine flow with a rapid and incessant course towards the Mediterranean, received the appellation of Bosphorus, a name not less celebrated in the history, than in the fables, of antiquity.  <a name="fr_214"></a><a href="#fn_214"><font size="1">3</font></a> A crowd of temples and of votive altars, profusely scattered along its steep and woody banks, attested the unskilfulness, the terrors, and the devotion of the Grecian navigators, who, after the example of the Argonauts, explored the dangers of the inhospitable Euxine.  On these banks tradition long preserved the memory of the palace of Phineus, infested by the obscene harpies;  <a name="fr_215"></a><a href="#fn_215"><font size="1">4</font></a> and of the sylvan reign of Amycus, who defied the son of Leda to the combat of the cestus.  <a name="fr_216"></a><a href="#fn_216"><font size="1">5</font></a> The straits of the Bosphorus are terminated by the Cyanean rocks, which, according to the description of the poets, had once floated on the face of the waters; and were destined by the gods to protect the entrance of the Euxine against the eye of profane curiosity.  <a name="fr_217"></a><a href="#fn_217"><font size="1">6</font></a> From the Cyanean rocks to the point and harbor of Byzantium, the winding length of the Bosphorus extends about sixteen miles,  <a name="fr_218"></a><a href="#fn_218"><font size="1">7</font></a> and its most ordinary breadth may be computed at about one mile and a half.  The new castles of Europe and Asia are constructed, on either continent, upon the foundations of two celebrated temples, of Serapis and of Jupiter Urius.  The old castles, a work of the Greek emperors, command the narrowest part of the channel in a place where the opposite banks advance within five hundred paces of each other.  These fortresses were destroyed and strengthened by Mahomet the Second, when he meditated the siege of Constantinople:  <a name="fr_219"></a><a href="#fn_219"><font size="1">8</font></a> but the Turkish conqueror was most probably ignorant, that near two thousand years before his reign, continents by a bridge of boats.  <a name="fr_220"></a><a href="#fn_220"><font size="1">9</font></a> At a small distance from the old castles we discover the little town of Chrysopolis, or Scutari, which may almost be considered as the Asiatic suburb of Constantinople.  The Bosphorus, as it begins to open into the Propontis, passes between Byzantium and Chalcedon.  The latter of those cities was built by the Greeks, a few years before the former; and the blindness of its founders, who overlooked the superior advantages of the opposite coast, has been stigmatized by a proverbial expression of contempt.  <a name="fr_221"></a><a href="#fn_221"><font size="1">10</font></a> </p>

        The harbor of Constantinople, which may be considered as an arm of the Bosphorus, obtained, in a very remote period, the denomination of the Golden Horn.  The curve which it describes might be compared to the horn of a stag, or as it should seem, with more propriety, to that of an ox.  <a name="fr_222"></a><a href="#fn_222"><font size="1">11</font></a> The epithet of golden was expressive of the riches which every wind wafted from the most distant countries into the secure and capacious port of Constantinople.  The River Lycus, formed by the conflux of two little streams, pours into the harbor a perpetual supply of fresh water, which serves to cleanse the bottom, and to invite the periodical shoals of fish to seek their retreat in that convenient recess.  As the vicissitudes of tides are scarcely felt in those seas, the constant depth of the harbor allows goods to be landed on the quays without the assistance of boats; and it has been observed, that in many places the largest vessels may rest their prows against the houses, while their sterns are floating in the water.  <a name="fr_223"></a><a href="#fn_223"><font size="1">12</font></a> From the mouth of the Lycus to that of the harbor, this arm of the Bosphorus is more than seven miles in length.  The entrance is about five hundred yards broad, and a strong chain could be occasionally drawn across it, to guard the port and city from the attack of a hostile navy.  <a name="fr_224"></a><a href="#fn_224"><font size="1">13</font></a> </p> 
 <p>
   
   
  </p> 
 <p>     Between the Bosphorus and the Hellespont, the shores of Europe and Asia, receding on either side, enclose the sea of Marmara, which was known to the ancients by the denomination of Propontis.  The navigation from the issue of the Bosphorus to the entrance of the Hellespont is about one hundred and twenty miles.  Those who steer their westward course through the middle of the Propontis, amt at once descry the high lands of Thrace and Bithynia, and never lose sight of the lofty summit of Mount Olympus, covered with eternal snows.  <a name="fr_225"></a><a href="#fn_225"><font size="1">14</font></a> They leave on the left a deep gulf, at the bottom of which Nicomedia was seated, the Imperial residence of Diocletian; and they pass the small islands of Cyzicus and Proconnesus before they cast anchor at Gallipoli; where the sea, which separates Asia from Europe, is again contracted into a narrow channel. </p> 
 <p>
        The geographers who, with the most skilful accuracy, have surveyed the form and extent of the Hellespont, assign about sixty miles for the winding course, and about three miles for the ordinary breadth of those celebrated straits.  <a name="fr_226"></a><a href="#fn_226"><font size="1">15</font></a> But the narrowest part of the channel is found to the northward of the old Turkish castles between the cities of Sestus and Abydus.  It was here that the adventurous Leander braved the passage of the flood for the possession of his mistress.  <a name="fr_227"></a><a href="#fn_227"><font size="1">16</font></a> It was here likewise, in a place where the distance between the opposite banks cannot exceed five hundred paces, that Xerxes imposed a stupendous bridge of boats, for the purpose of transporting into Europe a hundred and seventy myriads of barbarians.  <a name="fr_228"></a><a href="#fn_228"><font size="1">17</font></a> A sea contracted within such narrow limits may seem but ill to deserve the singular epithet of broad, which Homer, as well as Orpheus, has frequently bestowed on the Hellespont.  <a name="fr_229"></a><a href="#fn_229"><font size="1">*_0023</font></a> But our ideas of greatness are of a relative nature: the traveller, and especially the poet, who sailed along the Hellespont, who pursued the windings of the stream, and contemplated the rural scenery, which appeared on every side to terminate the prospect, insensibly lost the remembrance of the sea; and his fancy painted those celebrated straits, with all the attributes of a mighty river flowing with a swift current, in the midst of a woody and inland country, and at length, through a wide mouth, discharging itself into the Aegean or Archipelago.  <a name="fr_230"></a><a href="#fn_230"><font size="1">18</font></a> Ancient Troy,  <a name="fr_231"></a><a href="#fn_231"><font size="1">19</font></a> seated on a an eminence at the foot of Mount Ida, overlooked the mouth of the Hellespont, which scarcely received an accession of waters from the tribute of those immortal rivulets the Simois and Scamander.  The Grecian camp had stretched twelve miles along the shore from the Sigaean to the Rhaetean promontory; and the flanks of the army were guarded by the bravest chiefs who fought under the banners of Agamemnon.  The first of those promontories was occupied by Achilles with his invincible myrmidons, and the dauntless Ajax pitched his tents on the other.  After Ajax had fallen a sacrifice to his disappointed pride, and to the ingratitude of the Greeks, his sepulchre was erected on the ground where he had defended the navy against the rage of Jove and of Hector; and the citizens of the rising town of Rhaeteum celebrated his memory with divine honors.  <a name="fr_232"></a><a href="#fn_232"><font size="1">20</font></a> Before Constantine gave a just preference to the situation of Byzantium, he had conceived the design of erecting the seat of empire on this celebrated spot, from whence the Romans derived their fabulous origin.  The extensive plain which lies below ancient Troy, towards the Rhaetean promontory and the tomb of Ajax, was first chosen for his new capital; and though the undertaking was soon relinquished the stately remains of unfinished walls and towers attracted the notice of all who sailed through the straits of the Hellespont.  <a name="fr_233"></a><a href="#fn_233"><font size="1">21</font></a> </p>

 <p>     We are at present qualified to view the advantageous position of Constantinople; which appears to have been formed by nature for the centre and capital of a great monarchy.  Situated in the forty-first degree of latitude, the Imperial city commanded, from her seven hills,  <a name="fr_234"></a><a href="#fn_234"><font size="1">22</font></a> the opposite shores of Europe and Asia; the climate was healthy and temperate, the soil fertile, the harbor secure and capacious; and the approach on the side of the continent was of small extent and easy defence.  The Bosphorus and the Hellespont may be considered as the two gates of Constantinople; and the prince who possessed those important passages could always shut them against a naval enemy, and open them to the fleets of commerce.  The preservation of the eastern provinces may, in some degree, be ascribed to the policy of Constantine, as the barbarians of the Euxine, who in the preceding age had poured their armaments into the heart of the Mediterranean, soon desisted from the exercise of piracy, and despaired of forcing this insurmountable barrier.  When the gates of the Hellespont and Bosphorus were shut, the capital still enjoyed within their spacious enclosure every production which could supply the wants, or gratify the luxury, of its numerous inhabitants.  The sea-coasts of Thrace and Bithynia, which languish under the weight of Turkish oppression, still exhibit a rich prospect of vineyards, of gardens, and of plentiful harvests; and the Propontis has ever been renowned for an inexhaustible store of the most exquisite fish, that are taken in their stated seasons, without skill, and almost without labor.  <a name="fr_235"></a><a href="#fn_235"><font size="1">23</font></a> But when the passages of the straits were thrown open for trade, they alternately admitted the natural and artificial riches of the north and south, of the Euxine, and of the Mediterranean.  Whatever rude commodities were collected in the forests of Germany and Scythia, and far as the sources of the Tanais and the Borysthenes; whatsoever was manufactured by the skill of Europe or Asia; the corn of Egypt, and the gems and spices of the farthest India, were brought by the varying winds into the port of Constantinople, which for many ages attracted the commerce of the ancient world.  <a name="fr_236"></a><a href="#fn_236"><font size="1">24</font></a> </p>

 <p>     The prospect of beauty, of safety, and of wealth, united in a single spot, was sufficient to justify the choice of Constantine.  But as some decent mixture of prodigy and fable has, in every age, been supposed to reflect a becoming majesty on the origin of great cities,  <a name="fr_237"></a><a href="#fn_237"><font size="1">25</font></a> the emperor was desirous of ascribing his resolution, not so much to the uncertain counsels of human policy, as to the infallible and eternal decrees of divine wisdom.  In one of his laws he has been careful to instruct posterity, that in obedience to the commands of God, he laid the everlasting foundations of Constantinople:  <a name="fr_238"></a><a href="#fn_238"><font size="1">26</font></a> and though he has not condescended to relate in what manner the celestial inspiration was communicated to his mind, the defect of his modest silence has been liberally supplied by the ingenuity of succeeding writers; who describe the nocturnal vision which appeared to the fancy of Constantine, as he slept within the walls of Byzantium.  The tutelar genius of the city, a venerable matron sinking under the weight of years and infirmities, was suddenly transformed into a blooming maid, whom his own hands adorned with all the symbols of Imperial greatness.  <a name="fr_239"></a><a href="#fn_239"><font size="1">27</font></a> The monarch awoke, interpreted the auspicious omen, and obeyed, without hesitation, the will of Heaven The day which gave birth to a city or colony was celebrated by the Romans with such ceremonies as had been ordained by a generous superstition;  <a name="fr_240"></a><a href="#fn_240"><font size="1">28</font></a> and though Constantine might omit some rites which savored too strongly of their Pagan origin, yet he was anxious to leave a deep impression of hope and respect on the minds of the spectators.  On foot, with a lance in his hand, the emperor himself led the solemn procession; and directed the line, which was traced as the boundary of the destined capital: till the growing circumference was observed with astonishment by the assistants, who, at length, ventured to observe, that he had already exceeded the most ample measure of a great city. "I shall still advance," replied Constantine, "till He, the invisible guide who marches before me, thinks proper to stop."  <a name="fr_241"></a><a href="#fn_241"><font size="1">29</font></a> Without presuming to investigate the nature or motives of this extraordinary conductor, we shall content ourselves with the more humble task of describing the extent and limits of Constantinople.  <a name="fr_242"></a><a href="#fn_242"><font size="1">30</font></a> </p>

 <p>     In the actual state of the city, the palace and gardens of the Seraglio occupy the eastern promontory, the first of the seven hills, and cover about one hundred and fifty acres of our own measure.  The seat of Turkish jealousy and despotism is erected on the foundations of a Grecian republic; but it may be supposed that the Byzantines were tempted by the conveniency of the harbor to extend their habitations on that side beyond the modern limits of the Seraglio.  The new walls of Constantine stretched from the port to the Propontis across the enlarged breadth of the triangle, at the distance of fifteen stadia from the ancient fortification; and with the city of Byzantium they enclosed five of the seven hills, which, to the eyes of those who approach Constantinople, appear to rise above each other in beautiful order.  <a name="fr_243"></a><a href="#fn_243"><font size="1">31</font></a> About a century after the death of the founder, the new buildings, extending on one side up the harbor, and on the other along the Propontis, already covered the narrow ridge of the sixth, and the broad summit of the seventh hill.  The necessity of protecting those suburbs from the incessant inroads of the barbarians engaged the younger Theodosius to surround his capital with an adequate and permanent enclosure of walls.  <a name="fr_244"></a><a href="#fn_244"><font size="1">32</font></a> From the eastern promontory to the golden gate, the extreme length of Constantinople was about three Roman miles;  <a name="fr_245"></a><a href="#fn_245"><font size="1">33</font></a> the circumference measured between ten and eleven; and the surface might be computed as equal to about two thousand English acres.  It is impossible to justify the vain and credulous exaggerations of modern travellers, who have sometimes stretched the limits of Constantinople over the adjacent villages of the European, and even of the Asiatic coast.  <a name="fr_246"></a><a href="#fn_246"><font size="1">34</font></a> But the suburbs of Pera and Galata, though situate beyond the harbor, may deserve to be considered as a part of the city;  <a name="fr_247"></a><a href="#fn_247"><font size="1">35</font></a> and this addition may perhaps authorize the measure of a Byzantine historian, who assigns sixteen Greek (about fourteen Roman) miles for the circumference of his native city.  <a name="fr_248"></a><a href="#fn_248"><font size="1">36</font></a> Such an extent may not seem unworthy of an Imperial residence.  Yet Constantinople must yield to Babylon and Thebes,  <a name="fr_249"></a><a href="#fn_249"><font size="1">37</font></a> to ancient Rome, to London, and even to Paris.  <a name="fr_250"></a><a href="#fn_250"><font size="1">38</font></a> </p>

I should much doubt whether the invaders have ever outnumbered the men of any country which they attacked.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_229"></a><a href="daf02009.htm#fr_229">*_0023</a> Gibbon does not allow greater width between the two nearest points of the shores of the Hellespont than between those of the Bosphorus; yet all the ancient writers speak of the Hellespontic strait as broader than the other: they agree in giving it seven stadia in its narrowest width, (Herod. in Melp. c. 85.  Polym. c. 34.  Strabo, p. 591.  Plin. iv. c. 12.) which make 875 paces.  It is singular that Gibbon, who in the fifteenth note of this chapter reproaches d'Anville with being fond of supposing new and perhaps imaginary measures, has here adopted the peculiar measurement which d'Anville has assigned to the stadium.  This great geographer believes that the ancients had a stadium of fifty-one toises, and it is that which he applies to the walls of Babylon.  Now, seven of these stadia are equal to about 500 paces, 7 stadia = 2142 feet: 500 paces = 2135 feet 5 inches. - G. See Rennell, Geog. of Herod. p. 121.  Add Ukert, Geographie der Griechen und Romer, v. i. p. 2, 71. - M.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_230"></a><a href="daf02009.htm#fr_230">18</a> See Wood's Observations on Homer, p. 320.  I have, with pleasure, selected this remark from an author who in general seems to have disappointed the expectation of the public as a critic, and still more as a traveller.  He had visited the banks of the Hellespont; and had read Strabo; he ought to have consulted the Roman itineraries.  How was it possible for him to confound Ilium and Alexandria Troas, (Observations, p. 340, 341,) two cities which were sixteen miles distant from each other? </p> 
 <p>     Note: Compare Walpole's Memoirs on Turkey, v. i. p. 101. Dr. Clarke adopted Mr. Walpole's interpretation of the salt Hellespont.  But the old interpretation is more graphic and Homeric. Clarke's Travels, ii. 70. - M.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_231"></a><a href="daf02009.htm#fr_231">19</a> Demetrius of Scepsis wrote sixty books on thirty lines of Homer's catalogue.  The XIIIth Book of Strabo is sufficient for our curiosity.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_232"></a><a href="daf02009.htm#fr_232">20</a> Strabo, l. xiii. p. 595, [890, edit. Casaub.] The disposition of the ships, which were drawn upon dry land, and the posts of Ajax and Achilles, are very clearly described by Homer.  See Iliad, ix. 220.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_233"></a><a href="daf02009.htm#fr_233">21</a> Zosim. l. ii. [c. 30,] p. 105.  Sozomen, l. ii. c. 3. Theophanes, p. 18.  Nicephorus Callistus, l. vii. p. 48.  Zonaras, tom. ii. l. xiii. p. 6.  Zosimus places the new city between Ilium and Alexandria, but this apparent difference may be reconciled by the large extent of its circumference.  Before the foundation of Constantinople, Thessalonica is mentioned by Cedrenus, (p. 283,) and Sardica by Zonaras, as the intended capital.  They both suppose with very little probability, that the emperor, if he had not been prevented by a prodigy, would have repeated the mistake of the blind Chalcedonians.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_235"></a><a href="daf02009.htm#fr_235">23</a> See Belon, Observations, c. 72 - 76.  Among a variety of different species, the Pelamides, a sort of Thunnies, were the most celebrated.  We may learn from Polybius, Strabo, and Tacitus, that the profits of the fishery constituted the principal revenue of Byzantium.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_236"></a><a href="daf02009.htm#fr_236">24</a> See the eloquent description of Busbequius, epistol. i. p. 64. Est in Europa; habet in conspectu Asiam, Egyptum. Africamque a dextra: quae tametsi contiguae non sunt, maris tamen navigandique commoditate veluti junguntur.  A sinistra vero Pontus est Euxinus, &amp;c.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_239"></a><a href="daf02009.htm#fr_239">27</a> The Greeks, Theophanes, Cedrenus, and the author of the Alexandrian Chronicle, confine themselves to vague and general expressions. For a more particular account of the vision, we are obliged to have recourse to such Latin writers as William of Malmesbury.  See Ducange, C. P. l. i. p. 24, 25.</p>

Among other ceremonies, a large hole, which had been dug for that purpose, was filled up with handfuls of earth, which each of the settlers brought from the place of his birth, and thus adopted his new country.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_242"></a><a href="daf02009.htm#fr_242">30</a> See in the Memoires de l'Academie, tom. xxxv p. 747 - 758, a dissertation of M. d'Anville on the extent of Constantinople.  He takes the plan inserted in the Imperium Orientale of Banduri as the most complete; but, by a series of very nice observations, he reduced the extravagant proportion of the scale, and instead of 9500, determines the circumference of the city as consisting of about 7800 French toises.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_243"></a><a href="daf02009.htm#fr_243">31</a> Codinus, Antiquitat. Const. p. 12.  He assigns the church of St. Anthony as the boundary on the side of the harbor.  It is mentioned in Ducange, l. iv. c. 6; but I have tried, without success, to discover the exact place where it was situated.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_244"></a><a href="daf02009.htm#fr_244">32</a> The new wall of Theodosius was constructed in the year 413. In 447 it was thrown down by an earthquake, and rebuilt in three months by the diligence of the praefect Cyrus.  The suburb of the Blanchernae was first taken into the city in the reign of Heraclius Ducange, Const. l. i. c. 10, 11.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_245"></a><a href="daf02009.htm#fr_245">33</a> The measurement is expressed in the Notitia by 14,075 feet. It is reasonable to suppose that these were Greek feet, the proportion of which has been ingeniously determined by M. d'Anville.  He compares the 180 feet with 78 Hashemite cubits, which in different writers are assigned for the heights of St. Sophia.  Each of these cubits was equal to 27 French inches.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_246"></a><a href="daf02009.htm#fr_246">34</a> The accurate Thevenot (l. i. c. 15) walked in one hour and three quarters round two of the sides of the triangle, from the Kiosk of the Seraglio to the seven towers.  D'Anville examines with care, and receives with confidence, this decisive testimony, which gives a circumference of ten or twelve miles.  The extravagant computation of Tournefort (Lettre XI) of thirty-tour or thirty miles, without including Scutari, is a strange departure from his usual character.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_247"></a><a href="daf02009.htm#fr_247">35</a> The sycae, or fig-trees, formed the thirteenth region, and were very much embellished by Justinian.  It has since borne the names of Pera and Galata.  The etymology of the former is obvious; that of the latter is unknown.  See Ducange, Const. l. i. c. 22, and Gyllius de Byzant. l. iv. c. 10.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_248"></a><a href="daf02009.htm#fr_248">36</a> One hundred and eleven stadia, which may be translated into modern Greek miles each of seven stadia, or 660, sometimes only 600 French toises.  See D'Anville, Mesures Itineraires, p. 53.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_249"></a><a href="daf02009.htm#fr_249">37</a> When the ancient texts, which describe the size of Babylon and Thebes, are settled, the exaggerations reduced, and the measures ascertained, we find that those famous cities filled the great but not incredible circumference of about twenty-five or thirty miles.  Compare D'Anville, Mem. de l'Academie, tom. xxviii. p. 235, with his Description de l'Egypte, p. 201, 202.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_250"></a><a href="daf02009.htm#fr_250">38</a> If we divide Constantinople and Paris into equal squares of 50 French toises, the former contains 850, and the latter 1160, of those divisions.</p>
