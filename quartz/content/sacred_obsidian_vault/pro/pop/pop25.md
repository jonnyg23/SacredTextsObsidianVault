 <h3 align="CENTER">The Twentieth Figure</h3>
 <p>'A thing standeth upright as long as it can be upheld; but when man alone uplifteth, then in its time, the highest will become lowest. In this wise shall man set his wisdom against the earth and bury it therein, from whence it hath come, and it shall give way to another. For human wisdom may last for a time. She is compared to a flower in the field, that is lovely and pleasing in herself. But the flower doth not remain, much less human wisdom. It is said "Time bringeth roses," but these also fade. Thus shall it happen to thee, because thou art of thyself.'</p>
