 <hr><center><h1>Shri Guru Granth Sahib: Raag Raamkalee</h1></center>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 001</h2></center>
  Raamkalee, First Mehl, First House, Chau-Padas:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. No Fear. No Hatred. Image Of The Undying. Beyond Birth. Self-Existent. By Guru's Grace:<br>
  Some read the Sanskrit scriptures, and some read the Puraanas.<br>
  Some meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and chant it on their malas, focusing on it in meditation.<br>
  I know nothing, now or ever; I recognize only Your One Name, Lord. ||1||<br>
  I do not know, Lord, what my condition shall be.<br>
  I am foolish and ignorant; I seek Your Sanctuary, God. Please, save my honor and my self-respect. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Sometimes, the soul soars high in the heavens, and sometimes it falls to the depths of the nether regions.<br>
  The greedy soul does not remain stable; it searches in the four directions. ||2||<br>
  With death pre-ordained, the soul comes into the world, gathering the riches of life.<br>
  I see that some have already gone, O my Lord and Master; the burning fire is coming closer! ||3||<br>
  No one has any friend, and no one has any brother; no one has any father or mother.<br>
  Prays Nanak, if You bless me with Your Name, it shall be my help and support in the end. ||4||1||<br>
  Raamkalee, First Mehl:<br>
  Your Light is prevailing everywhere.<br>
  Wherever I look, there I see the Lord. ||1||<br>
  Please rid me of the desire to live, O my Lord and Master.<br>
  My mind is entangled in the deep dark pit of Maya. How can I cross over, O Lord and Master? ||1||Pause||<br>
  He dwells deep within, inside the heart; how can He not be outside as well?<br>
  Our Lord and Master always takes care of us, and keeps us in His thoughts. ||2||<br>
  He Himself is near at hand, and He is far away.<br>
  He Himself is all-pervading, permeating everywhere.<br>
  Meeting the True Guru, the darkness is dispelled.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 002</h2></center>
  Wherever I look, there I see Him pervading. ||3||<br>
  There is doubt within me, and Maya is outside; it hits me in the eyes like an arrow.<br>
  Prays Nanak, the slave of the Lord's slaves: such a mortal suffers terribly. ||4||2||<br>
  Raamkalee, First Mehl:<br>
  Where is that door, where You live, O Lord? What is that door called? Among all doors, who can find that door?<br>
  For the sake of that door, I wander around sadly, detached from the world; if only someone would come and tell me about that door. ||1||<br>
  How can I cross over the world-ocean?<br>
  While I am living, I cannot be dead. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Pain is the door, and anger is the guard; hope and anxiety are the two shutters.<br>
  Maya is the water in the moat; in the middle of this moat, he has built his home. The Primal Lord sits in the Seat of Truth. ||2||<br>
  You have so many Names, Lord, I do not know their limit. There is no other equal to You.<br>
  Do not speak out loud - remain in your mind. The Lord Himself knows, and He Himself acts. ||3||<br>
  As long as there is hope, there is anxiety; so how can anyone speak of the One Lord?<br>
  In the midst of hope, remain untouched by hope; then, O Nanak, you shall meet the One Lord. ||4||<br>
  In this way, you shall cross over the world-ocean.<br>
  This is the way to remain dead while yet alive. ||1||Second Pause||3||<br>
  Raamkalee, First Mehl:<br>
  Awareness of the Shabad and the Teachings is my horn; the people hear the sound of its vibrations.<br>
  Honor is my begging-bowl, and the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the charity I receive. ||1||<br>
  O Baba, Gorakh is the Lord of the Universe; He is always awake and aware.<br>
  He alone is Gorakh, who sustains the earth; He created it in an instant. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Binding together water and air, He infused the breath of life into the body, and made the lamps of the sun and the moon.<br>
  To die and to live, He gave us the earth, but we have forgotten these blessings. ||2||<br>
  There are so many Siddhas, seekers, Yogis, wandering pilgrims, spiritual teachers and good people.<br>
  If I meet them, I chant the Lord's Praises, and then, my mind serves Him. ||3||<br>
  Paper and salt, protected by ghee, remain untouched by water, as the lotus remains unaffected in water.<br>
  Those who meet with such devotees, O servant Nanak - what can death do to them? ||4||4||<br>
  Raamkalee, First Mehl:<br>
  Listen, Machhindra, to what Nanak says.<br>
  One who subdues the five passions does not waver.<br>
  One who practices Yoga in such a way,<br>
  saves himself, and saves all his generations. ||1||<br>
  He alone is a hermit, who attains such understanding.<br>
  Day and night, he remains absorbed in deepest Samaadhi. ||1||Pause||<br>
  He begs for loving devotion to the Lord, and lives in the Fear of God.<br>
  He is satisfied, with the priceless gift of contentment.<br>
  Becoming the embodiment of meditation, he attains the true Yogic posture.<br>
  He focuses his consciousness in the deep trance of the True Name. ||2||<br>
  Nanak chants the Ambrosial Bani.<br>
  Listen, O Machhindra: this is the insignia of the true hermit.<br>
  One who, in the midst of hope, remains untouched by hope,<br>
  shall truly find the Creator Lord. ||3||<br>
  Prays Nanak, I share the mysterious secrets of God.<br>
  The Guru and His disciple are joined together!<br>
  One who eats this food, this medicine of the Teachings,<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 003</h2></center>
  has the wisdom of the six Shaastras. ||4||5||<br>
  Raamkalee, First Mehl:<br>
  My boat is wobbly and unsteady; it is filled with sins. The wind is rising - what if it tips over?<br>
  As sunmukh, I have turned to the Guru; O my Perfect Master; please be sure to bless me with Your glorious greatness. ||1||<br>
  O Guru, my Saving Grace, please carry me across the world-ocean.<br>
  Bless me with devotion to the perfect, imperishable Lord God; I am a sacrifice to You. ||1||Pause||<br>
  He alone is a Siddha, a seeker, a Yogi, a wandering pilgrim, who meditates on the One Perfect Lord.<br>
  Touching the feet of the Lord Master, they are emancipated; they come to receive the Word of the Teachings. ||2||<br>
  I know nothing of charity, meditation, self-discipline or religious rituals; I only chant Your Name, God.<br>
  Nanak has met the Guru, the Transcendent Lord God; through the True Word of His Shabad, he is set free. ||3||6||<br>
  Raamkalee, First Mehl:<br>
  Focus your consciousness in deep absorption on the Lord.<br>
  Make your body a raft, to cross over.<br>
  Deep within is the fire of desire; keep it in check.<br>
  Day and night, that lamp shall burn unceasingly. ||1||<br>
  Float such a lamp upon the water;<br>
  this lamp will bring total understanding. ||1||Pause||<br>
  This understanding is good clay;<br>
  a lamp made of such clay is acceptable to the Lord.<br>
  So shape this lamp on the wheel of good actions.<br>
  In this world and in the next, this lamp shall be with you. ||2||<br>
  When He Himself grants His Grace,<br>
  then, as Gurmukh, one may understand Him.<br>
  Within the heart, this lamp is permanently lit.<br>
  It is not extinguished by water or wind.<br>
  Such a lamp will carry you across the water. ||3||<br>
  Wind does not shake it, or put it out.<br>
  Its light reveals the Divine Throne.<br>
  The Kh'shaatriyas, Brahmins, Soodras and Vaishyas<br>
  cannot find its value, even by thousands of calculations.<br>
  If any of them lights such a lamp,<br>
  O Nanak, he is emancipated. ||4||7||<br>
  Raamkalee, First Mehl:<br>
  To place one's faith in Your Name, Lord, is true worship.<br>
  With an offering of Truth, one obtains a place to sit.<br>
  If a prayer is offered with truth and contentment,<br>
  the Lord will hear it, and call him in to sit by Him. ||1||<br>
  O Nanak, no one returns empty-handed;<br>
  such is the Court of the True Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The treasure I seek is the gift of Your Grace.<br>
  Please bless this humble beggar - this is what I seek.<br>
  Please, pour Your Love into the cup of my heart.<br>
  This is Your pre-determined value. ||2||<br>
  The One who created everything, does everything.<br>
  He Himself appraises His own value.<br>
  The Sovereign Lord King becomes manifest to the Gurmukh.<br>
  He does not come, and He does not go. ||3||<br>
  People curse at the beggar; by begging, he does not receive honor.<br>
  O Lord, You inspire me to speak Your Words, and tell the Story of Your Court. ||4||8||<br>
  Raamkalee, First Mehl:<br>
  The drop is in the ocean, and the ocean is in the drop. Who understands, and knows this?<br>
  He Himself creates the wondrous play of the world. He Himself contemplates it, and understands its true essence. ||1||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 004</h2></center>
  How rare are those who contemplate this spiritual wisdom.<br>
  Through this, the supreme state of liberation is attained. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The night is in the day, and the day is in the night. The same is true of hot and cold.<br>
  No one else knows His state and extent; without the Guru, this is not understood. ||2||<br>
  The female is in the male, and the male is in the female. Understand this, O God-realized being!<br>
  The meditation is in the music, and knowledge is in meditation. Become Gurmukh, and speak the Unspoken Speech. ||3||<br>
  The Light is in the mind, and the mind is in the Light. The Guru brings the five senses together, like brothers.<br>
  Nanak is forever a sacrifice to those who enshrine love for the One Word of the Shabad. ||4||9||<br>
  Raamkalee, First Mehl:<br>
  When the Lord God showered His Mercy,<br>
  egotism was eradicated from within me.<br>
  That humble servant who contemplates the Word of the Guru's Shabad, is very dear to the Lord. ||1||<br>
  That humble servant of the Lord is pleasing to his Lord God;<br>
  day and night, he performs devotional worship, day and night. Disregarding his own honor, he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The unstruck melody of the sound current resonates and resounds;<br>
  my mind is appeased by the subtle essence of the Lord.<br>
  Through the Perfect Guru, I am absorbed in Truth.<br>
  Through the Guru, I have found the Lord, the Primal Being. ||2||<br>
  Gurbani is the sound current of the Naad, the Vedas, everything.<br>
  My mind is attuned to the Lord of the Universe.<br>
  He is my sacred shrine of pilgrimage, fasting and austere self-discipline.<br>
  The Lord saves, and carries across, those who meet with the Guru. ||3||<br>
  One whose self-conceit is gone, sees his fears run away.<br>
  That servant grasps the Guru's feet.<br>
  The Guru, the True Guru, has expelled my doubts.<br>
  Says Nanak, I have merged into the Word of the Shabad. ||4||10||<br>
  Raamkalee, First Mehl:<br>
  He runs around, begging for clothes and food.<br>
  He burns with hunger and corruption, and will suffer in the world hereafter.<br>
  He does not follow the Guru's Teachings; through his evil-mindedness, he loses his honor.<br>
  Only through the Guru's Teachings will such a person become devoted. ||1||<br>
  The way of the Yogi is to dwell in the celestial home of bliss.<br>
  He looks impartially, equally upon all. He receives the charity of the Lord's Love, and the Word of the Shabad, and so he is satisfied. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The five bulls, the senses, pull the wagon of the body around.<br>
  By the Lord's power, one's honor is preserved.<br>
  But when the axle breaks, the wagon falls and crashes.<br>
  It falls apart, like a pile of logs. ||2||<br>
  Contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad, Yogi.<br>
  Look upon pain and pleasure as one and the same, sorrow and separation.<br>
  Let your food be contemplative meditation upon the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<br>
  Your wall shall be permanent, by meditating on the Formless Lord. ||3||<br>
  Wear the loin-cloth of poise, and be free of entanglements.<br>
  The Guru's Word shall release you from sexual desire and anger.<br>
  In your mind, let your ear-rings be the Sanctuary of the Guru, the Lord.<br>
  O Nanak, worshipping the Lord in deep devotion, the humble are carried across. ||4||11||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 005</h2></center>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Raamkalee, Third Mehl, First House:<br>
  In the Golden Age of Sat Yuga, everyone spoke the Truth.<br>
  In each and every home, devotional worship was performed by the people, according to the Guru's Teachings.<br>
  In that Golden Age, Dharma had four feet.<br>
  How rare are those people who, as Gurmukh, contemplate this and understand. ||1||<br>
  In all four ages, the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is glory and greatness.<br>
  One who holds tight to the Naam is liberated; without the Guru, no one obtains the Naam. ||1||Pause||<br>
  In the Silver Age of Traytaa Yuga, one leg was removed.<br>
  Hypocrisy became prevalent, and people thought that the Lord was far away.<br>
  The Gurmukhs still understood and realized;<br>
  the Naam abided deep within them, and they were at peace. ||2||<br>
  In the Brass Age of Dwaapur Yuga, duality and double-mindedness arose.<br>
  Deluded by doubt, they knew duality.<br>
  In this Brass Age, Dharma was left with only two feet.<br>
  Those who became Gurmukh implanted the Naam deep within. ||3||<br>
  In the Iron Age of Kali Yuga, Dharma was left with only one power.<br>
  It walks on just one foot; love and emotional attachment to Maya have increased.<br>
  Love and emotional attachment to Maya bring total darkness.<br>
  If someone meets the True Guru, he is saved, through the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||4||<br>
  Throughout the ages, there is only the One True Lord.<br>
  Among all, is the True Lord; there is no other at all.<br>
  Praising the True Lord, true peace is attained.<br>
  How rare are those, who as Gurmukh, chant the Naam. ||5||<br>
  Throughout all the ages, the Naam is the ultimate, the most sublime.<br>
  How rare are those, who as Gurmukh, understand this.<br>
  One who meditates on the Lord's Name is a humble devotee.<br>
  O Nanak, in each and every age, the Naam is glory and greatness. ||6||1||<br>
  Raamkalee, Fourth Mehl, First House:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  If someone is very fortunate, and is blessed with great high destiny, then he meditates on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.<br>
  Chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, he finds peace, and merges in the Naam. ||1||<br>
  O mortal, as Gurmukh, worship the Lord in devotion forever.<br>
  Your heart shall be illumined; through the Guru's Teachings, lovingly attune yourself to the Lord. You shall merge in the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The Great Giver is filled with diamonds, emeralds, rubies and pearls;<br>
  one who has good fortune and great destiny inscribed upon his forehead, digs them out, by following the Guru's Teachings. ||2||<br>
  The Lord's Name is the jewel, the emerald, the ruby; digging it out, the Guru has placed it in your palm.<br>
  The unfortunate, self-willed manmukh does not obtain it; this priceless jewel remains hidden behind a curtain of straw. ||3||<br>
  If such pre-ordained destiny is written upon one's forehead, then the True Guru enjoins him to serve Him.<br>
  O Nanak, then he obtains the jewel, the gem; blessed, blessed is that one who follows the Guru's Teachings, and finds the Lord. ||4||1||<br>
  Raamkalee, Fourth Mehl:<br>
  Meeting with the humble servants of the Lord, I am in ecstasy; they preach the sublime sermon of the Lord.<br>
  The filth of evil-mindedness is totally washed away; joining the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, one is blessed with understanding. ||1||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 006</h2></center>
  O humble servant of the Lord, follow the Guru's Teachings, and chant the Name of the Lord.<br>
  Whoever hears and speaks it is liberated; chanting the Lord's Name, one is embellished with beauty. ||1||Pause||<br>
  If someone has supremely high destiny written on his forehead, the Lord leads him to meet the humble servants of the Lord.<br>
  Be merciful, and grant me the Blessed Vision of the Saints' Darshan, which shall rid me of all poverty and pain. ||2||<br>
  The Lord's people are good and sublime; the unfortunate ones do not like them at all.<br>
  The more the Lord's exalted servants speak of Him, the more the slanderers attack and sting them. ||3||<br>
  Cursed, cursed are the slanderers who do not like the humble, the friends and companions of the Lord.<br>
  Those who do not like the honor and glory of the Guru are faithless, black-faced thieves, who have turned their backs on the Lord. ||4||<br>
  Have mercy, have mercy, please save me, Dear Lord. I am meek and humble - I seek Your protection.<br>
  I am Your child, and You are my father, God. Please forgive servant Nanak and merge him with Yourself. ||5||2||<br>
  Raamkalee, Fourth Mehl:<br>
  The friends of the Lord, the humble, Holy Saints are sublime; the Lord spreads out His protecting hands above them.<br>
  The Gurmukhs are the Holy Saints, pleasing to God; in His mercy, He blends them with Himself. ||1||<br>
  O Lord, my mind longs to meet with the humble servants of the Lord.<br>
  The sweet, subtle essence of the Lord is immortalizing ambrosia. Meeting the Saints, I drink it in. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The Lord's people are the most lofty and exalted. Meeting with them, the most exalted status is obtained.<br>
  I am the slave of the slave of the Lord's slaves; my Lord and Master is pleased with me. ||2||<br>
  The humble servant serves; one who enshrines love for the Lord in his heart, mind and body is very fortunate.<br>
  One who talks too much without love, speaks falsely, and obtains only false rewards. ||3||<br>
  Take pity on me, O Lord of the World, O Great Giver; let me fall at the feet of the Saints.<br>
  I would cut off my head, and cut it into pieces, O Nanak, and set it down for the Saints to walk upon. ||4||3||<br>
  Raamkalee, Fourth Mehl:<br>
  If I am blessed with supreme high destiny, I will meet the humble servants of the Lord, without delay.<br>
  The Lord's humble servants are pools of ambrosial nectar; by great good fortune, one bathes in them. ||1||<br>
  O Lord, let me work for the humble servants of the Lord.<br>
  I carry water, wave the fan and grind the corn for them; I massage and wash their feet. I apply the dust of their feet to my forehead. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The Lord's humble servants are great, very great, the greatest and most exalted; they lead us to meet the True Guru.<br>
  No one else is as great as the True Guru; meeting the True Guru, I meditate on the Lord, the Primal Being. ||2||<br>
  Those who seek the Sanctuary of the True Guru find the Lord. My Lord and Master saves their honor.<br>
  Some come for their own purposes, and sit before the Guru; they pretend to be in Samaadhi, like storks with their eyes closed. ||3||<br>
  Associating with the wretched and the lowly, like the stork and the crow, is like feeding on a carcass of poison.<br>
  Nanak: O God, unite me with the Sangat, the Congregation. United with the Sangat, I will become a swan. ||4||4||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 007</h2></center>
  Raamkalee, Fourth Mehl:<br>
  O True Guru, please be kind, and unite me with the Lord. My Sovereign Lord is the Beloved of my breath of life.<br>
  I am a slave; I fall at the Guru's feet. He has shown me the Path, the Way to my Lord God. ||1||<br>
  The Name of my Lord, Har, Har, is pleasing to my mind.<br>
  I have no friend except the Lord; the Lord is my father, my mother, my companion. ||1||Pause||<br>
  My breath of life will not survive for an instant, without my Beloved; unless I see Him, I will die, O my mother!<br>
  Blessed, blessed is my great, high destiny, that I have come to the Guru's Sanctuary. Meeting with the Guru, I have obtained the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan. ||2||<br>
  I do not know or understand any other within my mind; I meditate and chant the Lord's Chant.<br>
  Those who lack the Naam, wander in shame; their noses are chopped off, bit by bit. ||3||<br>
  O Life of the World, rejuvenate me! O my Lord and Master, enshrine Your Name deep within my heart.<br>
  O Nanak, perfect is the Guru, the Guru. Meeting the True Guru, I meditate on the Naam. ||4||5||<br>
  Raamkalee, Fourth Mehl:<br>
  The True Guru, the Great Giver, is the Great, Primal Being; meeting Him, the Lord is enshrined within the heart.<br>
  The Perfect Guru has granted me the life of the soul; I meditate in remembrance on the Ambrosial Name of the Lord. ||1||<br>
  O Lord, the Guru has implanted the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, within my heart.<br>
  As Gurmukh, I have heard His sermon, which pleases my mind; blessed, blessed is my great destiny. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Millions, three hundred thirty millions of gods meditate on Him, but they cannot find His end or limitation.<br>
  With sexual urges in their hearts, they beg for beautiful women; stretching out their hands, they beg for riches. ||2||<br>
  One who chants the Praises of the Lord is the greatest of the great; the Gurmukh keeps the Lord clasped to his heart.<br>
  If one is blessed with high destiny, he meditates on the Lord, who carries him across the terrifying world-ocean. ||3||<br>
  The Lord is close to His humble servant, and His humble servant is close to the Lord; He keeps His humble servant clasped to His Heart.<br>
  O Nanak, the Lord God is our father and mother. I am His child; the Lord cherishes me. ||4||6||18||<br>
  Raag Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl, First House:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Have mercy on me, O Generous Giver, Lord of the meek; please do not consider my merits and demerits.<br>
  How can dust be washed? O my Lord and Master, such is the state of mankind. ||1||<br>
  O my mind, serve the True Guru, and be at peace.<br>
  Whatever you desire, you shall receive that reward, and you shall not be afflicted by pain any longer. ||1||Pause||<br>
  He creates and adorns the earthen vessels; He infuses His Light within them.<br>
  As is the destiny pre-ordained by the Creator, so are the deeds we do. ||2||<br>
  He believes the mind and body are all his own; this is the cause of his coming and going.<br>
  He does not think of the One who gave him these; he is blind, entangled in emotional attachment. ||3||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 008</h2></center>
  One who knows that God created him, reaches the Incomparable Mansion of the Lord's Presence.<br>
  Worshipping the Lord, I sing His Glorious Praises. Nanak is Your slave. ||4||1||<br>
  Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Place yourself beneath all men's feet, and you will be uplifted; serve Him in this way.<br>
  Know that all are above you, and you shall find peace in the Court of the Lord. ||1||<br>
  O Saints, speak that speech which purifies the gods and sanctifies the divine beings. As Gurmukh, chant the Word of His Bani, even for an instant. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Renounce your fraudulent plans, and dwell in the celestial palace; do not call anyone else false.<br>
  Meeting with the True Guru, you shall receive the nine treasures; in this way, you shall find the essence of reality. ||2||<br>
  Eradicate doubt, and as Gurmukh, enshrine love for the Lord; understand your own soul, O Siblings of Destiny.<br>
  Know that God is near at hand, and ever-present. How could you try to hurt anyone else? ||3||<br>
  Meeting with the True Guru, your path shall be clear, and you shall easily meet your Lord and Master.<br>
  Blessed, blessed are those humble beings, who, in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, find the Lord. Nanak is forever a sacrifice to them. ||4||2||<br>
  Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Coming does not please me, and going does not bring me pain, and so my mind is not afflicted by disease.<br>
  I am in bliss forever, for I have found the Perfect Guru; my separation from the Lord is totally ended. ||1||<br>
  This is how I have joined my mind to the Lord.<br>
  Attachment, sorrow, disease and public opinion do not affect me, and so, I enjoy the subtle essence of the Lord, Har, Har, Har. ||1||Pause||<br>
  I am pure in the heavenly realm, pure on this earth, and pure in the nether regions of the underworld. I remain apart from the people of the world.<br>
  Obedient to the Lord, I enjoy peace forever; wherever I look, I see the Lord of glorious virtues. ||2||<br>
  There is no Shiva or Shakti, no energy or matter, no water or wind, no world of form there,<br>
  where the True Guru, the Yogi, dwells, where the Imperishable Lord God, the Unapproachable Master abides. ||3||<br>
  Body and mind belong to the Lord; all wealth belongs to the Lord; what glorious virtues of the Lord can I describe?<br>
  Says Nanak, the Guru has destroyed my sense of 'mine and yours'. Like water with water, I am blended with God. ||4||3||<br>
  Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  It is beyond the three qualities; it remains untouched. The seekers and Siddhas do not know it.<br>
  There is a chamber filled with jewels, overflowing with Ambrosial Nectar, in the Guru's Treasury. ||1||<br>
  This thing is wonderful and amazing! It cannot be described.<br>
  It is an unfathomable object, O Siblings of Destiny! ||1||Pause||<br>
  Its value cannot be estimated at all; what can anyone say about it?<br>
  By speaking and describing it, it cannot be understood; only one who sees it realizes it. ||2||<br>
  Only the Creator Lord knows it; what can any poor creature do?<br>
  Only He Himself knows His own state and extent. The Lord Himself is the treasure overflowing. ||3||<br>
  Tasting such Ambrosial Nectar, the mind remains satisfied and satiated.<br>
  Says Nanak, my hopes are fulfilled; I have found the Guru's Sanctuary. ||4||4||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 009</h2></center>
  Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  God has made me His own, and vanquished all my enemies.<br>
  Those enemies who have plundered this world, have all been placed in bondage. ||1||<br>
  The True Guru is my Transcendent Lord.<br>
  I enjoy countless pleasures of power and tasty delights, chanting Your Name, and placing my faith in You. ||1||Pause||<br>
  I do not think of any other at all. The Lord is my protector, above my head.<br>
  I am carefree and independent, when I have the Support of Your Name, O my Lord and Master. ||2||<br>
  I have become perfect, meeting with the Giver of peace, and now, I lack nothing at all.<br>
  I have obtained the essence of excellence, the supreme status; I shall not forsake it to go anywhere else. ||3||<br>
  I cannot describe how You are, O True Lord, unseen, infinite,<br>
  immeasurable, unfathomable and unmoving Lord. O Nanak, He is my Lord and Master. ||4||5||<br>
  Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  You are wise; You are eternal and unchanging. You are my social class and honor.<br>
  You are unmoving - You never move at all. How can I be worried? ||1||<br>
  You alone are the One and only Lord;<br>
  You alone are the king.<br>
  By Your Grace, I have found peace. ||1||Pause||<br>
  You are the ocean, and I am Your swan; the pearls and rubies are in You.<br>
  You give, and You do not hesitate for an instant; I receive, forever enraptured. ||2||<br>
  I am Your child, and You are my father; You place the milk in my mouth.<br>
  I play with You, and You caress me in every way. You are forever the ocean of excellence. ||3||<br>
  You are perfect, perfectly all-pervading; I am fulfilled with You as well.<br>
  I am merged, merged, merged and remain merged; O Nanak, I cannot describe it! ||4||6||<br>
  Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Make your hands the cymbals, your eyes the tambourines, and your forehead the guitar you play.<br>
  Let the sweet flute music resound in your ears, and with your tongue, vibrate this song.<br>
  Move your mind like the rhythmic hand-motions; do the dance, and shake your ankle bracelets. ||1||<br>
  This is the rhythmic dance of the Lord.<br>
  The Merciful Audience, the Lord, sees all your make-up and decorations. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The whole earth is the stage, with the canopy of the sky overhead.<br>
  The wind is the director; people are born of water.<br>
  From the five elements, the puppet was created with its actions. ||2||<br>
  The sun and the moon are the two lamps which shine, with the four corners of the world placed between them.<br>
  The ten senses are the dancing girls, and the five passions are the chorus; they sit together within the one body.<br>
  They all put on their own shows, and speak in different languages. ||3||<br>
  In each and every home there is dancing, day and night; in each and every home, the bugles blow.<br>
  Some are made to dance, and some are whirled around; some come and some go, and some are reduced to dust.<br>
  Says Nanak, one who meets with the True Guru, does not have to dance the dance of reincarnation again. ||4||7||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 010</h2></center>
  Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  He sings the song of the One Universal Creator; he sings the tune of the One Lord.<br>
  He lives in the land of the One Lord, shows the way to the One Lord, and remains attuned to the One Lord.<br>
  He centers his consciousness on the One Lord, and serves only the One Lord, who is known through the Guru. ||1||<br>
  Blessed and good is such a kirtanee, who sings such Praises.<br>
  He sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord,<br>
  and renounces the entanglements and pursuits of Maya. ||1||Pause||<br>
  He makes the five virtues, like contentment, his musical instruments, and plays the seven notes of the love of the Lord.<br>
  The notes he plays are the renunciation of pride and power; his feet keep the beat on the straight path.<br>
  He does not enter the cycle of reincarnation ever again; he keeps the One Word of the Shabad tied to the hem of his robe. ||2||<br>
  To play like Naarad, is to know that the Lord is ever-present.<br>
  The tinkling of the ankle bells is the shedding of sorrows and worries.<br>
  The dramatic gestures of acting are celestial bliss.<br>
  Such a dancer is not reincarnated again. ||3||<br>
  If anyone, out of millions of people, becomes pleasing to his Lord and Master, he sings the Lord's Praises in this way.<br>
  I have taken the Support of the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.<br>
  Says Nanak, the Kirtan of the One Lord's Praises are sung there. ||4||8||<br>
  Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Some call Him, 'Raam, Raam', and some call Him, 'Khudaa-i'.<br>
  Some serve Him as 'Gusain', others as 'Allaah'. ||1||<br>
  He is the Cause of causes, the Generous Lord.<br>
  He showers His Grace and Mercy upon us. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Some bathe at sacred shrines of pilgrimage, and some make the pilgrimage to Mecca.|<br>
  Some perform devotional worship services, and some bow their heads in prayer. ||2||<br>
  Some read the Vedas, and some the Koran.<br>
  Some wear blue robes, and some wear white. ||3||<br>
  Some call themselves Muslim, and some call themselves Hindu.<br>
  Some yearn for paradise, and others long for heaven. ||4||<br>
  Says Nanak, one who realizes the Hukam of God's Will,<br>
  knows the secrets of his Lord and Master. ||5||9||<br>
  Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  The wind merges into the wind.<br>
  The light blends into the light.<br>
  The dust becomes one with the dust.<br>
  What support is there for the one who is lamenting? ||1||<br>
  Who has died? O, who has died?<br>
  O God-realized beings, meet together and consider this. What a wondrous thing has happened! ||1||Pause||<br>
  No one knows what happens after death.<br>
  The one who is lamenting will also arise and depart.<br>
  Mortal beings are bound by the bonds of doubt and attachment.<br>
  When life becomes a dream, the blind man babbles and grieves in vain. ||2||<br>
  The Creator Lord created this creation.<br>
  It comes and goes, subject to the Will of the Infinite Lord.<br>
  No one dies; no one is capable of dying.<br>
  The soul does not perish; it is imperishable. ||3||<br>
  That which is known, does not exist.<br>
  I am a sacrifice to the one who knows this.<br>
  Says Nanak, the Guru has dispelled my doubt.<br>
  No one dies; no one comes or goes. ||4||10||<br>
  Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Meditate on the Lord of the Universe, the Beloved Lord of the World.<br>
  Meditating in remembrance on the Lord's Name, you shall live, and the Great Death shall not consume you ever again. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Through millions of incarnations, you have come, wandering, wandering, wandering.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 011</h2></center>
  By the highest destiny, you found the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||1||<br>
  Without the Perfect Guru, no one is saved.<br>
  This is what Baba Nanak says, after deep reflection. ||2||11||<br>
  Raag Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl, Second House:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  The four Vedas proclaim it, but you don't believe them.<br>
  The six Shaastras also say one thing.<br>
  The eighteen Puraanas all speak of the One God.<br>
  Even so, Yogi, you do not understand this mystery. ||1||<br>
  The celestial harp plays the incomparable melody,<br>
  but in your intoxication, you do not hear it, O Yogi. ||1||Pause||<br>
  In the first age, the Golden Age, the village of truth was inhabited.<br>
  In the Silver Age of Traytaa Yuga, things began to decline.<br>
  In the Brass Age of Dwaapur Yuga, half of it was gone.<br>
  Now, only one leg of Truth remains, and the One Lord is revealed. ||2||<br>
  The beads are strung upon the one thread.<br>
  By means of many, various, diverse knots, they are tied, and kept separate on the string.<br>
  The beads of the mala are lovingly chanted upon in many ways.<br>
  When the thread is pulled out, the beads come together in one place. ||3||<br>
  Throughout the four ages, the One Lord made the body His temple.<br>
  It is a treacherous place, with several windows.<br>
  Searching and searching, one comes to the Lord's door.<br>
  Then, O Nanak, the Yogi attains a home in the Mansion of the Lord's Presence. ||4||<br>
  Thus, the celestial harp plays the incomparable melody;<br>
  hearing it, the Yogi's mind finds it sweet. ||1||Second Pause||1||12||<br>
  Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  The body is a patch-work of threads.<br>
  The muscles are stitched together with the needles of the bones.<br>
  The Lord has erected a pillar of water.<br>
  O Yogi, why are you so proud? ||1||<br>
  Meditate on your Lord Master, day and night.<br>
  The patched coat of the body shall last for only a few days. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Smearing ashes on your body, you sit in a deep meditative trance.<br>
  You wear the ear-rings of 'mine and yours'.<br>
  You beg for bread, but you are not satisfied.<br>
  Abandoning your Lord Master, you beg from others; you should feel ashamed. ||2||<br>
  Your consciousness is restless, Yogi, as you sit in your Yogic postures.<br>
  You blow your horn, but still feel sad.<br>
  You do not understand Gorakh, your guru.<br>
  Again and again, Yogi, you come and go. ||3||<br>
  He, unto whom the Master shows Mercy<br>
  - unto Him, the Guru, the Lord of the World, I offer my prayer.<br>
  One who has the Name as his patched coat, and the Name as his robe,<br>
  O servant Nanak, such a Yogi is steady and stable. ||4||<br>
  One who meditates on the Master in this way, night and day,<br>
  finds the Guru, the Lord of the World, in this life. ||1||Second Pause||2||13||<br>
  Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  He is the Creator, the Cause of causes;<br>
  I do not see any other at all.<br>
  My Lord and Master is wise and all-knowing.<br>
  Meeting with the Gurmukh, I enjoy His Love. ||1||<br>
  Such is the sweet, subtle essence of the Lord.<br>
  How rare are those who, as Gurmukh, taste it. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The Light of the Ambrosial Name of the Lord is immaculate and pure.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 012</h2></center>
  Drinking it in, one becomes immortal and free of desire.<br>
  The body and mind are cooled and soothed, and the fire is extinguished.<br>
  Such a being is the embodiment of bliss, famous throughout the world. ||2||<br>
  What can I offer You, Lord? Everything belongs to You.<br>
  I am forever a sacrifice to You, hundreds of thousands of times.<br>
  You blessed me, and fashioned my body, mind and soul.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, this lowly being was exalted. ||3||<br>
  Opening the door, You summoned me to the Mansion of Your Presence.<br>
  As You are, so You have revealed Yourself to me.<br>
  Says Nanak, the screen is totally torn away;<br>
  I am Yours, and You are enshrined within my mind. ||4||3||14||<br>
  Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  He has linked His servant to His service.<br>
  The Divine Guru has poured the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord, into his mouth.<br>
  He has subdued all his anxiety.<br>
  I am forever a sacrifice to that Guru. ||1||<br>
  The True Guru has perfectly resolved my affairs.<br>
  The True Guru vibrates the unstruck melody of the sound current. ||1||Pause||<br>
  His Glory is profound and unfathomable.<br>
  One whom He blesses with patience becomes blissful.<br>
  One whose bonds are shattered by the Sovereign Lord<br>
  is not cast into the womb of reincarnation again. ||2||<br>
  One who is illuminated by the Lord's radiance within,<br>
  is not touched by pain and sorrow.<br>
  He holds in his robe the gems and jewels.<br>
  That humble being is saved, along with all his generations. ||3||<br>
  He has no doubt, double-mindedness or duality at all.<br>
  He worships and adores the One Immaculate Lord alone.<br>
  Wherever I look, I see the Merciful Lord.<br>
  Says Nanak, I have found God, the source of nectar. ||4||4||15||<br>
  Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  My self-conceit has been eliminated from my body.<br>
  The Will of God is dear to me.<br>
  Whatever He does, seems sweet to my mind.<br>
  And then, these eyes behold the wondrous Lord. ||1||<br>
  Now, I have become wise and my demons are gone.<br>
  My thirst is quenched, and my attachment is dispelled. The Perfect Guru has instructed me. ||1||Pause||<br>
  In His Mercy, the Guru has kept me under His protection.<br>
  The Guru has attached me to the Lord's Feet.<br>
  When the mind is totally held in check,<br>
  one sees the Guru and the Supreme Lord God as one and the same. ||2||<br>
  Whoever You have created, I am his slave.<br>
  My God dwells in all.<br>
  I have no enemies, no adversaries.<br>
  I walk arm in arm, like brothers, with all. ||3||<br>
  One whom the Guru, the Lord, blesses with peace,<br>
  does not suffer in pain any longer.<br>
  He Himself cherishes all.<br>
  Nanak is imbued with the love of the Lord of the World. ||4||5||16||<br>
  Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  You read the scriptures, and the commentaries,<br>
  but the Perfect Lord does not dwell in your heart.<br>
  You preach to others to have faith,<br>
  but you do not practice what you preach. ||1||<br>
  O Pandit, O religious scholar, contemplate the Vedas.<br>
  Eradicate anger from your mind, O Pandit. ||1||Pause||<br>
  You place your stone god before yourself,<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 013</h2></center>
  but your mind wanders in the ten directions.<br>
  You apply a ceremonial tilak mark to its forehead, and fall at its feet.<br>
  You try to appease the people, and act blindly. ||2||<br>
  You perform the six religious rituals, and sit wearing your loin-cloth.<br>
  In the homes of the wealthy, you read the prayer book.<br>
  You chant on your mala, and beg for money.<br>
  No one has ever been saved in this way, friend. ||3||<br>
  He alone is a Pandit, who lives the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<br>
  Maya, of the three qualities, leaves him.<br>
  The four Vedas are completely contained within the Lord's Name.<br>
  Nanak seeks His Sanctuary. ||4||6||17||<br>
  Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Millions of troubles do not come near him;<br>
  the many manifestations of Maya are his hand-maidens;<br>
  countless sins are his water-carriers;<br>
  he is blessed with the Grace of the Creator Lord. ||1||<br>
  One who has the Lord God as his help and support<br>
  - all his efforts are fulfilled. ||1||Pause||<br>
  He is protected by the Creator Lord; what harm can anyone do to him?<br>
  Even an ant can conquer the whole world.<br>
  His glory is endless; how can I describe it?<br>
  I am a sacrifice, a devoted sacrifice, to His feet. ||2||<br>
  He alone performs worship, austerities and meditation;<br>
  he alone is a giver to various charities;<br>
  he alone is approved in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga,<br>
  whom the Lord Master blesses with honor. ||3||<br>
  Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I am enlightened.<br>
  I have found celestial peace, and my hopes are fulfilled.<br>
  The Perfect True Guru has blessed me with faith.<br>
  Nanak is the slave of His slaves. ||4||7||18||<br>
  Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Don't blame others, O people;<br>
  as you plant, so shall you harvest.<br>
  By your actions, you have bound yourself.<br>
  You come and go, entangled in Maya. ||1||<br>
  Such is the understanding of the Saintly people.<br>
  You shall be enlightened, through the Word of the Perfect Guru. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Body, wealth, spouse and ostentatious displays are false.<br>
  Horses and elephants will pass away.<br>
  Power, pleasures and beauty are all false.<br>
  Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, everything is reduced to dust. ||2||<br>
  The egotistical people are deluded by useless doubt.<br>
  Of all this expanse, nothing shall go along with you.<br>
  Through pleasure and pain, the body is growing old.<br>
  Doing these things, the faithless cynics are passing their lives. ||3||<br>
  The Name of the Lord is Ambrosial Nectar in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga.<br>
  This treasure is obtained from the Holy.<br>
  O Nanak, whoever pleases the Guru,<br>
  the Lord of the Universe, beholds the Lord in each and every heart. ||4||8||19||<br>
  Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  The Panch Shabad, the five primal sounds, echo the perfect sound current of the Naad.<br>
  The wondrous, amazing unstruck melody vibrates.<br>
  The Saintly people play there with the Lord.<br>
  They remain totally detached, absorbed in the Supreme Lord God. ||1||<br>
  It is the realm of celestial peace and bliss.<br>
  The Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, sits and sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. There is no disease or sorrow there, no birth or death. ||1||Pause||<br>
  There, they meditate only on the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<br>
  How rare are those who find this place of rest.<br>
  The love of God is their food, and the Kirtan of the Lord's Praise is their support.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 014</h2></center>
  They obtain a permanent seat in the infinite. ||2||<br>
  No one falls there, or wavers, or goes anywhere.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, some find this mansion.<br>
  They are not touched by doubt, fear, attachment or the traps of Maya.<br>
  They enter the deepest state of Samaadhi, through the kind mercy of God. ||3||<br>
  He has no end or limitation.<br>
  He Himself is unmanifest, and He Himself is manifest.<br>
  One who enjoys the taste of the Lord, Har, Har, deep within himself,<br>
  O Nanak, his wondrous state cannot be described. ||4||9||20||<br>
  Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Meeting with the Sangat, the Congregation, the Supreme Lord God has come into my consciousness.<br>
  In the Sangat, my mind has found contentment.<br>
  I touch my forehead to the feet of the Saints.<br>
  Countless times, I humbly bow to the Saints. ||1||<br>
  This mind is a sacrifice to the Saints;<br>
  holding tight to their support, I have found peace, and in their mercy, they have protected me. ||1||Pause||<br>
  I wash the feet of the Saints, and drink in that water.<br>
  Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of the Saints' Darshan, I live.<br>
  My mind rests its hopes in the Saints.<br>
  The Saints are my immaculate wealth. ||2||<br>
  The Saints have covered my faults.<br>
  By the Grace of the Saints, I am no longer tormented.<br>
  The Merciful Lord has blessed me with the Saints' Congregation.<br>
  The Compassionate Saints have become my help and support. ||3||<br>
  My consciousness, intellect and wisdom have been enlightened.<br>
  The Lord is profound, unfathomable, infinite, the treasure of virtue.<br>
  He cherishes all beings and creatures.<br>
  Nanak is enraptured, seeing the Saints. ||4||10||21||<br>
  Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Your home, power and wealth will be of no use to you.<br>
  Your corrupt worldly entanglements will be of no use to you.<br>
  Know that all your dear friends are fake.<br>
  Only the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, will go along with you. ||1||<br>
  Sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord's Name, O friend; remembering the Lord in meditation, your honor shall be saved.<br>
  Remembering the Lord in meditation, the Messenger of Death will not touch you. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Without the Lord, all pursuits are useless.<br>
  Gold, silver and wealth are just dust.<br>
  Chanting the Word of the Guru's Shabad, your mind shall be at peace.<br>
  Here and hereafter, your face shall be radiant and bright. ||2||<br>
  Even the greatest of the great worked and worked until they were exhausted.<br>
  None of them ever accomplished the tasks of Maya.<br>
  Any humble being who chants the Name of the Lord, Har, Har,<br>
  will have all his hopes fulfilled. ||3||<br>
  The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the anchor and support of the Lord's devotees.<br>
  The Saints are victorious in this priceless human life.<br>
  Whatever the Lord's Saint does, is approved and accepted.<br>
  Slave Nanak is a sacrifice to him. ||4||11||22||<br>
  Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  You gather wealth by exploiting people.<br>
  It is of no use to you; it was meant for others.<br>
  You practice egotism, and act like a blind man.<br>
  In the world hereafter, you shall be tied to the leash of the Messenger of Death. ||1||<br>
  Give up your envy of others, you fool!<br>
  You only live here for a night, you fool!<br>
  You are intoxicated with Maya, but you must soon arise and depart.<br>
  You are totally involved in the dream. ||1||Pause||<br>
  In his childhood, the child is blind.<br>
  In the fullness of youth, he is involved in foul-smelling sins.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 015</h2></center>
  In the third stage of life, he gathers the wealth of Maya.<br>
  And when he grows old, he must leave all this; he departs regretting and repenting. ||2||<br>
  After a very long time, one obtains this precious human body, so difficult to obtain.<br>
  Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, it is reduced to dust.<br>
  Worse than a beast, a demon or an idiot,<br>
  is that one who does not understand who created him. ||3||<br>
  Listen, O Creator Lord, Lord of the Universe, Lord of the World,<br>
  Merciful to the meek, forever compassionate<br>
  - If You emancipate the human, then his bonds are broken.<br>
  O Nanak, the people of world are blind; please, Lord, forgive them, and unite them with Yourself. ||4||12||23||<br>
  Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Joining the elements together, the robe of the body is fashioned.<br>
  The ignorant fool is engrossed in it.<br>
  He cherishes it, and constantly takes care of it.<br>
  But at the very last moment, he must arise and depart. ||1||<br>
  Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, everything is false, O mortal.<br>
  Those who do not vibrate and meditate on the Lord of the Universe, but instead are imbued with other things, - all those mortals are plundered by Maya. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Bathing at sacred shrines of pilgrimage, filth is not washed off.<br>
  Religious rituals are all just egotistical displays.<br>
  By pleasing and appeasing people, no one is saved.<br>
  Without the Naam, they shall depart weeping. ||2||<br>
  Without the Lord's Name, the screen is not torn away.<br>
  I have studied all the Shaastras and Simritees.<br>
  He alone chants the Naam, whom the Lord Himself inspires to chant.<br>
  He obtains all fruits and rewards, and merges in peace. ||3||<br>
  O Savior Lord, please save me!<br>
  All peace and comforts are in Your Hand, God.<br>
  Whatever you attach me to, to that I am attached, O my Lord and Master.<br>
  O Nanak, the Lord is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts. ||4||13||24||<br>
  Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Whatever He does makes me happy.<br>
  The ignorant mind is encouraged, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.<br>
  Now, it does not waver at all; it has become stable and steady.<br>
  Receiving Truth, it is merged in the True Lord. ||1||<br>
  Pain is gone, and all illness is gone.<br>
  I have accepted the Will of God in my mind, associating with the Great Person, the Guru. ||1||Pause||<br>
  All is pure; all is immaculate.<br>
  Whatever exists is good.<br>
  Wherever He keeps me, that is the place of liberation for me.<br>
  Whatever He makes me chant, is His Name. ||2||<br>
  That is the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage, where the Holy place their feet,<br>
  and that is heaven, where the Naam is chanted.<br>
  All bliss comes, when one obtains the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan.<br>
  I sing continuously, continually, the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||3||<br>
  The Lord Himself is pervading in each and every heart.<br>
  The glory of the Merciful Lord is radiant and manifest.<br>
  The shutters are opened, and doubts have run away.<br>
  Nanak has met with the Perfect Guru. ||4||14||25||<br>
  Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Millions of meditations and austerities rest in him,<br>
  along with wealth, wisdom, miraculous spiritual powers and angelic spiritual insight.<br>
  He enjoys the various shows and forms, pleasures and delicacies;<br>
  the Naam, the Name of the Lord, dwells within the heart of the Gurmukh. ||1||<br>
  Such is the glorious greatness of the Name of the Lord.<br>
  Its value cannot be described. ||1||Pause||<br>
  He alone is brave, patient and perfectly wise;<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 016</h2></center>

  He is totally peaceful, blissful and healthy;<br>
  he looks upon all impartially, and is perfectly detached.<br>
  He does not come and go, and he never wavers;<br>
  the Naam abides in his mind. ||3||<br>
  God is Merciful to the meek; He is the Lord of the World, the Lord of the Universe.<br>
  The Gurmukh meditates on Him, and his worries are gone.<br>
  The Guru has blessed Nanak with the Naam;<br>
  he serves the Saints, and works for the Saints. ||4||15||26||<br>

  Fall at the feet of the Perfect Guru;<br>
  you have slept for so many incarnations - wake up! ||1||<br>
  Chant the Chant of the Lord's Name, Har, Har.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, it shall be enshrined within your heart, and you shall cross over the terrifying world-ocean. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Meditate on the eternal treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, O mind,<br>
  and then, the screen of Maya shall be torn away.<br>
  Drink in the Ambrosial Nectar of the Guru's Shabad,<br>
  and then your soul shall be rendered immaculate and pure. ||2||<br>
  Searching, searching, searching, I have realized<br>
  that without devotional worship of the Lord, no one is saved.<br>
  So vibrate, and meditate on that Lord in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy;<br>
  your mind and body shall be imbued with love for the Lord. ||3||<br>
  Renounce all your cleverness and trickery.<br>
  O mind, without the Lord's Name, there is no place of rest.<br>
  The Lord of the Universe, the Lord of the World, has taken pity on me.<br>
  Nanak seeks the protection and support of the Lord, Har, Har. ||4||16||27||<br>

  In the Saints' Congregation, play joyfully with the Lord,<br>
  and you will not have to meet the Messenger of Death hereafter.<br>
  Your egotistical intellect shall be dispelled,<br>

  Sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord's Name, O Pandit.<br>
  Religious rituals and egotism are of no use at all. You shall go home with happiness, O Pandit. ||1||Pause||<br>
  I have earned the profit, the wealth of the Lord's praise.<br>
  All my hopes have been fulfilled.<br>
  Pain has left me, and peace has come to my home.<br>
  By the Grace of the Saints, my heart-lotus blossoms forth. ||2||<br>
  One who is blessed with the gift of the jewel of the Name,<br>
  obtains all treasures.<br>
  His mind becomes content, finding the Perfect Lord.<br>
  Why should he ever go begging again? ||3||<br>
  Hearing the Lord's sermon, he becomes pure and holy.<br>
  Chanting it with his tongue, he finds the way to salvation.<br>
  He alone is approved, who enshrines the Lord within his heart.<br>

  But suddenly, Death will catch you in its noose. ||1||<br>
  Seek the Sanctuary of the Lord's lotus feet, O my mind.<br>
  Chant the Name of the Lord, which will be your help and support. As Gurmukh, you shall obtain the true wealth. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Your unfinished worldly affairs will never be resolved.<br>
  You shall always regret your sexual desire, anger and pride.<br>
  You act in corruption in order to survive,<br>
  but not even an iota will go along with you, you ignorant fool! ||2||<br>
  You practice deception, and you know many tricks;<br>
  for the sake of mere shells, you throw dust upon your head.<br>
  You never even think of the One who gave you life.<br>
  The pain of false greed never leaves you. ||3||<br>
  When the Supreme Lord God becomes merciful,<br>
  this mind becomes the dust of the feet of the Holy.<br>
  With His lotus hands, He has attached us to the hem of His robe.<br>
  Nanak merges in the Truest of the True. ||4||41||52||<br>
  Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  I seek the Sanctuary of the Sovereign Lord.<br>
  I have become fearless, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe. In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, my pains have been taken away. ||1||Pause||<br>
  That person, within whose mind the Lord abides,<br>
  does not see the impassible world-ocean.<br>
  All one's affairs are resolved,<br>
  by chanting continually the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||<br>
  Why should His slave feel any anxiety? The Guru places His hand upon my forehead.<br>
  The fear of birth and death is dispelled;<br>
  I am a sacrifice to the Perfect Guru. ||2||<br>
  I am enraptured, meeting with the Guru, the Transcendent Lord.<br>
  He alone obtains the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan, who is blessed by His Mercy.<br>
  One who is blessed by the Grace of the Supreme Lord God,<br>
  crosses over the terrifying world-ocean in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||3||<br>
  Drink in the Ambrosial Nectar, O Beloved Holy people.<br>
  Your face shall be radiant and bright in the Court of the Lord.<br>
  Celebrate and be blissful, and abandon all corruption.<br>
  O Nanak, meditate on the Lord and cross over. ||4||42||53||<br>

  The fire runs away from the fuel.<br>
  The water runs away from the dust in all directions.<br>
  The feet are above, and the sky is beneath.<br>
  The ocean appears in the cup. ||1||<br>
  Such is our all-powerful dear Lord.<br>
  His devotees do not forget Him, even for an instant. Twenty-four hours a day, O mind, meditate on Him. ||1||Pause||<br>
  First comes the butter, and then the milk.<br>
  The dirt cleans the soap.<br>
  The fearless are afraid of fear.<br>
  The living are killed by the dead. ||2||<br>
  The visible body is hidden, and the etheric body is seen.<br>
  The Lord of the world does all these things.<br>
  The one who is cheated, is not cheated by the cheat.<br>
  With no merchandise, the trader trades again and again. ||3||<br>
  So join the Society of the Saints, and chant the Lord's Name.<br>
  So say the Simritees, Shaastras, Vedas and Puraanas.<br>
  Rare are those who contemplate and meditate on God.<br>
  O Nanak, they attain the supreme status. ||4||43||54||<br>
  Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Whatever pleases Him happens.<br>
  Forever and ever, I seek the Sanctuary of the Lord.There is none other than God. ||1||Pause||<br>
  You look upon your children, spouse and wealth; none of these will go along with you.<br>
  Eating the poisonous potion, you have gone astray. You will have to go, and leave Maya and your mansions. ||1||<br>
  Slandering others, you are totally ruined; because of your past actions, you shall be consigned to the womb of reincarnation.<br>
  Your past actions will not just go away; the most horrible Messenger of Death shall seize you. ||2||<br>
  You tell lies, and do not practice what you preach. Your desires are not satisfied - what a shame.<br>
  You have contracted an incurable disease; slandering the Saints, your body is wasting away; you are utterly ruined. ||3||<br>
  He embellishes those whom He has fashioned. He Himself gave life to the Saints.<br>
  O Nanak, He hugs His slaves close in His Embrace. Please grant Your Grace, O Supreme Lord God, and be kind to me as well. ||4||44||55||<br>
  Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Such is the Perfect Divine Guru, my help and support.<br>
  Meditation on Him is not wasted. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, I am enraptured.<br>
  The dust of His feet snaps the noose of Death.<br>
  His lotus feet dwell within my mind,<br>
  and so all the affairs of my body are arranged and resolved. ||1||<br>
  One upon whom He places His Hand, is protected.<br>
  My God is the Master of the masterless.<br>
  He is the Savior of sinners, the treasure of mercy.<br>
  Forever and ever, I am a sacrifice to Him. ||2||<br>
  One whom He blesses with His Immaculate Mantra,<br>
  renounces corruption; his egotistical pride is dispelled.<br>
  Meditate on the One Lord in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.<br>
  Sins are erased, through the love of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||3||<br>
  The Guru, the Transcendent Lord, dwells among all.<br>
  The treasure of virtue pervades and permeates each and every heart.<br>

  Sing the songs of Praise of the Lord.<br>
  Chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, total peace is obtained; coming and going is ended, my friend. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, one is enlightened,<br>

  One who feels hunger for the Naam sleeps in peace.<br>

  I humbly bow to the Lord, the Supreme Being.<br>
  The One, the One and Only Creator Lord permeates the water, the land, the earth and the sky. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Over and over again, the Creator Lord destroys, sustains and creates.<br>
  He has no home; He needs no nourishment. ||1||<br>
  The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is deep and profound, strong, poised, lofty, exalted and infinite.<br>
  He stages His plays; His Virtues are priceless. Nanak is a sacrifice to Him. ||2||1||59||<br>
  Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  You must abandon your beauty, pleasures, fragrances and enjoyments; beguiled by gold and sexual desire, you must still leave Maya behind. ||1||Pause||<br>
  You gaze upon billions and trillions of treasures and riches, which delight and comfort your mind,<br>
  but these will not go along with you. ||1||<br>
  Entangled with children, spouse, siblings and friends, you are enticed and fooled; these pass like the shadow of a tree.<br>

  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Raag Raamkalee, Ninth Mehl, Ti-Padas:<br>
  O mind, take the sheltering support of the Lord's Name.<br>
  Remembering Him in meditation, evil-mindedness is dispelled, and the state of Nirvaanaa is obtained. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Know that one who sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord is very fortunate.<br>
  The sins of countless incarnations are washed off, and he attains the heavenly realm. ||1||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 027</h2></center>
  At the very last moment, Ajaamal became aware of the Lord;<br>
  that state which even the supreme Yogis desire - he attained that state in an instant. ||2||<br>
  The elephant had no virtue and no knowledge; what religious rituals has he performed?<br>
  O Nanak, behold the way of the Lord, who bestowed the gift of fearlessness. ||3||1||<br>
  Raamkalee, Ninth Mehl:<br>
  Holy people: what way should I now adopt,<br>
  by which all evil-mindedness may be dispelled, and the mind may vibrate in devotional worship to the Lord? ||1||Pause||<br>
  My mind is entangled in Maya; it knows nothing at all of spiritual wisdom.<br>
  What is that Name, by which the world, contemplating it, might attain the state of Nirvaanaa? ||1||<br>
  When the Saints became kind and compassionate, they told me this.<br>
  Understand, that whoever sings the Kirtan of God's Praises, has performed all religious rituals. ||2||<br>
  One who enshrines the Lord's Name in his heart night and day - even for an instant<br>
  - has his fear of Death eradicated. O Nanak, his life is approved and fulfilled. ||3||2||<br>
  Raamkalee, Ninth Mehl:<br>
  O mortal, focus your thoughts on the Lord.<br>
  Moment by moment, your life is running out; night and day, your body is passing away in vain. ||1||Pause||<br>
  You have wasted your youth in corrupt pleasures, and your childhood in ignorance.<br>
  You have grown old, and even now, you do not understand, the evil-mindedness in which you are entangled. ||1||<br>
  Why have you forgotten your Lord and Master, who blessed you with this human life?<br>
  Remembering Him in meditation, one is liberated. And yet, you do not sing His Praises, even for an instant. ||2||<br>
  Why are you intoxicated with Maya? It will not go along with you.<br>
  Says Nanak, think of Him, remember Him in your mind. He is the Fulfiller of desires, who will be your help and support in the end. ||3||3||81||<br>
  Raamkalee, First Mehl, Ashtapadees:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  The same moon rises, and the same stars; the same sun shines in the sky.<br>
  The earth is the same, and the same wind blows. The age in which we dwell affects living beings, but not these places. ||1||<br>
  Give up your attachment to life.<br>
  Those who act like tyrants are accepted and approved - recognize that this is the sign of the Dark Age of Kali Yuga. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Kali Yuga has not been heard to have come to any country, or to be sitting at any sacred shrine.<br>
  It is not where the generous person gives to charities, nor seated in the mansion he has built. ||2||<br>
  If someone practices Truth, he is frustrated; prosperity does not come to the home of the sincere.<br>
  If someone chants the Lord's Name, he is scorned. These are the signs of Kali Yuga. ||3||<br>
  Whoever is in charge, is humiliated. Why should the servant be afraid,<br>
  when the master is put in chains? He dies at the hands of his servant. ||4||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 028</h2></center>
  Chant the Praises of the Lord; Kali Yuga has come.<br>
  The justice of the previous three ages is gone. One obtains virtue, only if the Lord bestows it. ||1||Pause||<br>
  In this turbulent age of Kali Yuga, Muslim law decides the cases, and the blue-robed Qazi is the judge.<br>
  The Guru's Bani has taken the place of Brahma's Veda, and the singing of the Lord's Praises are good deeds. ||5||<br>
  Worship without faith; self-discipline without truthfulness; the ritual of the sacred thread without chastity - what good are these?<br>
  You may bathe and wash, and apply a ritualistic tilak mark to your forehead, but without inner purity, there is no understanding. ||6||<br>
  In Kali Yuga, the Koran and the Bible have become famous.<br>
  The Pandit's scriptures and the Puraanas are not respected.<br>
  O Nanak, the Lord's Name now is Rehmaan, the Merciful.<br>
  Know that there is only One Creator of the creation. ||7||<br>
  Nanak has obtained the glorious greatness of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. There is no action higher than this.<br>
  If someone goes out to beg for what is already in his own home, then he should be chastised. ||8||1||<br>
  Raamkalee, First Mehl:<br>
  You preach to the world, and set up your house.<br>
  Abandoning your Yogic postures, how will you find the True Lord?<br>
  You are attached to possessiveness and the love of sexual pleasure.<br>
  You are not a renunciate, nor a man of the world. ||1||<br>
  Yogi, remain seated, and the pain of duality will run away from you.<br>
  You beg from door to door, and you don't feel ashamed. ||1||Pause||<br>
  You sing the songs, but you do not understand your own self.<br>
  How will the burning pain within be relieved?<br>
  Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, let your mind be absorbed in the Lord's Love,<br>
  and you will intuitively experience the charity of contemplation. ||2||<br>
  You apply ashes to your body, while acting in hypocrisy.<br>
  Attached to Maya, you will be beaten by Death's heavy club.<br>
  Your begging bowl is broken; it will not hold the charity of the Lord's Love.<br>
  Bound in bondage, you come and go. ||3||<br>
  You do not control your seed and semen, and yet you claim to practice abstinence.<br>
  You beg from Maya, lured by the three qualities.<br>
  You have no compassion; the Lord's Light does not shine in you.<br>
  You are drowned, drowned in worldly entanglements. ||4||<br>
  You wear religious robes, and your patched coat assumes many disguises.<br>
  You play all sorts of false tricks, like a juggler.<br>
  The fire of anxiety burns brightly within you.<br>
  Without the karma of good actions, how can you cross over? ||5||<br>
  You make ear-rings of glass to wear in your ears.<br>
  But liberation does not come from learning without understanding.<br>
  You are lured by the tastes of the tongue and sex organs.<br>
  You have become a beast; this sign cannot be erased. ||6||<br>
  The people of the world are entangled in the three modes; the Yogis are entangled in the three modes.<br>
  Contemplating the Word of the Shabad, sorrows are dispelled.<br>
  Through the Shabad, one becomes radiant, pure and truthful.<br>
  One who contemplates the true lifestyle is a Yogi. ||7||<br>
  The nine treasures are with You, Lord; You are potent, the Cause of causes.<br>
  You establish and disestablish; whatever You do, happens.<br>
  One who practices celibacy, chastity, self-control, truth and pure consciousness<br>
  - O Nanak, that Yogi is the friend of the three worlds. ||8||2||<br>
  Raamkalee, First Mehl:<br>
  Above the six chakras of the body dwells the detached mind.<br>
  Awareness of the vibration of the Word of the Shabad has been awakened deep within.<br>
  The unstruck melody of the sound current resonates and resounds within; my mind is attuned to it.<br>
  Through the Guru's Teachings, my faith is confirmed in the True Name. ||1||<br>
  O mortal, through devotion to the Lord, peace is obtained.<br>
  The Lord, Har, Har, seems sweet to the Gurmukh, who merges in the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||Pause||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 029</h2></center>
  Eradicating attachment to Maya, one merges into the Lord.<br>
  Meeting with the True Guru, we unite in His Union.<br>
  The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is a priceless jewel, a diamond.<br>
  Attuned to it, the mind is comforted and encouraged. ||2||<br>
  The diseases of egotism and possessiveness do not afflict<br>
  one who worships the Lord. Fear of the Messenger of Death runs away.<br>
  The Messenger of Death, the enemy of the soul, does not touch me at all.<br>
  The Immaculate Name of the Lord illuminates my heart. ||3||<br>
  Contemplating the Shabad, we become Nirankaari - we come to belong to the Formless Lord God.<br>
  Awakening to the Guru's Teachings, evil-mindedness is taken away.<br>
  Remaining awake and aware night and day, lovingly focused on the Lord,<br>
  one becomes Jivan Mukta - liberated while yet alive. He finds this state deep within himself. ||4||<br>
  In the secluded cave, I remain unattached.<br>
  With the Word of the Shabad, I have killed the five thieves.<br>
  My mind does not waver or go to the home of any other.<br>
  I remain intuitively absorbed deep within. ||5||<br>
  As Gurmukh, I remain awake and aware, unattached.<br>
  Forever detached, I am woven into the essence of reality.<br>
  The world is asleep; it dies, and comes and goes in reincarnation.<br>
  Without the Word of the Guru's Shabad, it does not understand. ||6||<br>
  The unstruck sound current of the Shabad vibrates day and night.<br>
  The Gurmukh knows the state of the eternal, unchanging Lord God.<br>
  When someone realizes the Shabad, then he truly knows.<br>
  The One Lord is permeating and pervading everywhere in Nirvaanaa. ||7||<br>
  My mind is intuitively absorbed in the state of deepest Samaadhi;<br>
  renouncing egotism and greed, I have come to know the One Lord.<br>
  When the disciple's mind accepts the Guru,<br>
  O Nanak, duality is eradicated, and he merges in the Lord. ||8||3||<br>
  Raamkalee, First Mehl:<br>
  You calculate the auspicious days, but you do not understand<br>
  that the One Creator Lord is above these auspicious days.<br>
  He alone knows the way, who meets the Guru.<br>
  When one follows the Guru's Teachings, then he realizes the Hukam of God's Command. ||1||<br>
  Do not tell lies, O Pandit; O religious scholar, speak the Truth.<br>
  When egotism is eradicated through the Word of the Shabad, then one finds His home. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Calculating and counting, the astrologer draws the horoscope.<br>
  He studies it and announces it, but he does not understand reality.<br>
  Understand, that the Word of the Guru's Shabad is above all.<br>
  Do not speak of anything else; it is all just ashes. ||2||<br>
  You bathe, wash, and worship stones.<br>
  But without being imbued with the Lord, you are the filthiest of the filthy.<br>
  Subduing your pride, you shall receive the supreme wealth of God.<br>
  The mortal is liberated and emancipated, meditating on the Lord. ||3||<br>
  You study the arguments, but do not contemplate the Vedas.<br>
  You drown yourself - how will you save your ancestors?<br>
  How rare is that person who realizes that God is in each and every heart.<br>
  When one meets the True Guru, then he understands. ||4||<br>
  Making his calculations, cynicism and suffering afflict his soul.<br>
  Seeking the Sanctuary of the Guru, peace is found.<br>
  I sinned and made mistakes, but now I seek Your Sanctuary.<br>
  The Guru led me to meet the Lord, according to my past actions. ||5||<br>
  If one does not enter the Guru's Sanctuary, God cannot be found.<br>
  Deluded by doubt, one is born, only to die, and come back again.<br>
  Dying in corruption, he is bound and gagged at Death's door.<br>
  The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is not in his heart, and he does not act according to the Shabad. ||6||<br>
  Some call themselves Pandits, religious scholars and spiritual teachers.<br>
  Tinged with double-mindedness, they do not find the Mansion of the Lord's Presence.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 030</h2></center>
  One who takes the Support of the Naam, by Guru's Grace,<br>
  is a rare person, one among millions, incomparable. ||7||<br>
  One is bad, and another good, but the One True Lord is contained in all.<br>
  Understand this, O spiritual teacher, through the support of the True Guru:<br>
  rare indeed is that Gurmukh, who realizes the One Lord.<br>
  His comings and goings cease, and he merges in the Lord. ||8||<br>
  Those who have the One Universal Creator Lord within their hearts,<br>
  possess all virtues; they contemplate the True Lord.<br>
  One who acts in harmony with the Guru's Will,<br>
  O Nanak, is absorbed in the Truest of the True. ||9||4||<br>
  Raamkalee, First Mehl:<br>
  Practicing restraint by Hatha Yoga, the body wears away.<br>
  The mind is not softened by fasting or austerities.<br>
  Nothing else is equal to worship of the Lord's Name. ||1||<br>
  Serve the Guru, O mind, and associate with the humble servants of the Lord.<br>
  The tyrannical Messenger of Death cannot touch you, and the serpent of Maya cannot sting you, when you drink in the sublime essence of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The world reads the arguments, and is softened only by music.<br>
  In the three modes and corruption, they are born and die.<br>
  Without the Lord's Name, they endure suffering and pain. ||2||<br>
  The Yogi draws the breath upwards, and opens the Tenth Gate.<br>
  He practices inner cleansing and the six rituals of purification.<br>
  But without the Lord's Name, the breath he draws is useless. ||3||<br>
  The fire of the five passions burns within him; how can he be calm?<br>
  The thief is within him; how can he taste the taste?<br>
  One who becomes Gurmukh conquers the body-fortress. ||4||<br>
  With filth within, he wanders around at places of pilgrimage.<br>
  His mind is not pure, so what is the use of performing ritual cleansings?<br>
  He carries the karma of his own past actions; who else can he blame? ||5||<br>
  He does not eat food; he tortures his body.<br>
  Without the Guru's wisdom, he is not satisfied.<br>
  The self-willed manmukh is born only to die, and be born again. ||6||<br>
  Go, and ask the True Guru, and associate with the Lord's humble servants.<br>
  Your mind shall merge into the Lord, and you shall not be reincarnated to die again.<br>
  Without the Lord's Name, what can anyone do? ||7||<br>
  Silence the mouse scurrying around within you.<br>
  Serve the Primal Lord, by chanting the Lord's Name.<br>
  O Nanak, God blesses us with His Name, when He grants His Grace. ||8||5||<br>
  Raamkalee, First Mehl:<br>
  The created Universe emanated from within You; there is no other at all.<br>
  Whatever is said to be, is from You, O God.<br>
  He is the True Lord and Master, throughout the ages.<br>
  Creation and destruction do not come from anyone else. ||1||<br>
  Such is my Lord and Master, profound and unfathomable.<br>
  Whoever meditates on Him, finds peace. The arrow of the Messenger of Death does not strike one who has the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is a priceless jewel, a diamond.<br>
  The True Lord Master is immortal and immeasurable.<br>
  That tongue which chants the True Name is pure.<br>
  The True Lord is in the home of the self; there is no doubt about it. ||2||<br>
  Some sit in the forests, and some make their home in the mountains.<br>
  Forgetting the Naam, they rot away in egotistical pride.<br>
  Without the Naam, what is the use of spiritual wisdom and meditation?<br>
  The Gurmukhs are honored in the Court of the Lord. ||3||<br>
  Acting stubbornly in egotism, one does not find the Lord.<br>
  Studying the scriptures, reading them to other people,<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 031</h2></center>
  and wandering around at places of pilgrimage, the disease is not taken away.<br>
  Without the Naam, how can one find peace? ||4||<br>
  No matter how much he tries, he cannot control his semen and seed.<br>
  His mind wavers, and he falls into hell.<br>
  Bound and gagged in the City of Death, he is tortured.<br>
  Without the Name, his soul cries out in agony. ||5||<br>
  The many Siddhas and seekers, silent sages and demi-gods<br>
  cannot satisfy themselves by practicing restraint through Hatha Yoga.<br>
  One who contemplates the Word of the Shabad, and serves the Guru<br>
  - his mind and body become immaculate, and his egotistical pride is obliterated. ||6||<br>
  Blessed with Your Grace, I obtain the True Name.<br>
  I remain in Your Sanctuary, in loving devotion.<br>
  Love for Your devotional worship has welled up within me.<br>
  As Gurmukh, I chant and meditate on the Lord's Name. ||7||<br>
  When one is rid of egotism and pride, his mind is drenched in the Lord's Love.<br>
  Practicing fraud and hypocrisy, he does not find God.<br>
  Without the Word of the Guru's Shabad, he cannot find the Lord's Door.<br>
  O Nanak, the Gurmukh contemplates the essence of reality. ||8||6||<br>
  Raamkalee, First Mehl:<br>
  As you come, so will you leave, you fool; as you were born, so will you die.<br>
  As you enjoy pleasures, so will you suffer pain. Forgetting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, you will fall into the terrifying world-ocean. ||1||<br>
  Gazing upon your body and wealth, you are so proud.<br>
  Your love for gold and sexual pleasures increases; why have you forgotten the Naam, and why do you wander in doubt? ||1||Pause||<br>
  You do not practice truth, abstinence, self-discipline or humility; the ghost within your skeleton has turned to dry wood.<br>
  You have not practiced charity, donations, cleansing baths or austerities. Without the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, your life has gone in vain. ||2||<br>
  Attached to greed, you have forgotten the Naam. Coming and going, your life has been ruined.<br>
  When the Messenger of Death grabs you by your hair, you will be punished. You are unconscious, and have fallen into Death's mouth. ||3||<br>
  Day and night, you jealously slander others; in your heart, you have neither the Naam, nor compassion for all.<br>
  Without the Word of the Guru's Shabad, you will not find salvation or honor. Without the Lord's Name, you shall go to hell. ||4||<br>
  In an instant, you change into various costumes, like a juggler; you are entangled in emotional attachment and sin.<br>
  You gaze here and there upon the expanse of Maya; you are intoxicated with attachment to Maya. ||5||<br>
  You act in corruption, and put on ostentatious shows, but without awareness of the Shabad, you have fallen into confusion.<br>
  You suffer great pain from the disease of egotism. Following the Guru's Teachings, you shall be rid of this disease. ||6||<br>
  Seeing peace and wealth come to him, the faithless cynic become proud in his mind.<br>
  But He who owns this body and wealth, takes them back again, and then the mortal feels anxiety and pain deep within. ||7||<br>
  At the very last instant, nothing goes along with you; all is visible only by His Mercy.<br>
  God is our Primal and Infinite Lord; enshrining the Lord's Name in the heart, one crosses over. ||8||<br>
  You weep for the dead, but who hears you weeping? The dead have fallen to the serpent in the terrifying world-ocean.<br>
  Gazing upon his family, wealth, household and mansions, the faithless cynic is entangled in worthless worldly affairs. ||9||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 032</h2></center>
  He comes when the Lord sends him; when the Lord calls him back, he goes.<br>
  Whatever he does, the Lord is doing. The Forgiving Lord forgives him. ||10||<br>
  I seek to be with those who have tasted this sublime essence of the Lord.<br>
  Wealth, miraculous spiritual powers, wisdom and spiritual knowledge, are obtained from the Guru. The treasure of liberation is obtained in His Sanctuary. ||11||<br>
  The Gurmukh looks upon pain and pleasure as one and the same; he remains untouched by joy and sorrow.<br>
  Conquering his self-conceit, the Gurmukh finds the Lord; O Nanak, he intuitively merges into the Lord. ||12||7||<br>
  Raamkalee, Dakhanee, First Mehl:<br>
  Abstinence, chastity, self-control and truthfulness have been implanted within me; I am imbued with the sublime essence of the True Word of the Shabad. ||1||<br>
  My Merciful Guru remains forever imbued with the Lord's Love.<br>
  Day and night, He remains lovingly focused on the One Lord; gazing upon the True Lord, He is pleased. ||1||Pause||<br>
  He abides in the Tenth Gate, and looks equally upon all; He is imbued with the unstruck sound current of the Shabad. ||2||<br>
  Wearing the loin-cloth of chastity, He remains absorbed in the all-pervading Lord; His tongue enjoys the taste of God's Love. ||3||<br>
  The One who created the creation has met the True Guru; contemplating the Guru's lifestyle, He is pleased. ||4||<br>
  All are in the One, and the One is in all. This is what the True Guru has shown me. ||5||<br>
  He who created the worlds, solar systems and galaxies - that God cannot be known. ||6||<br>
  From the lamp of God, the lamp within is lit; the Divine Light illuminates the three worlds. ||7||<br>
  The Guru sits on the true throne in the true mansion; He is attuned, absorbed in the Fearless Lord. ||8||<br>
  The Guru, the detached Yogi, has enticed the hearts of all; He plays His harp in each and every heart. ||9||<br>
  O Nanak, in God's Sanctuary, one is emancipated; the True Guru becomes our true help and support. ||10||8||<br>
  Raamkalee, First Mehl:<br>
  He has made His home in the monastery of the heart; He has infused His power into the earth and the sky. ||1||<br>
  Through the Word of the Shabad, the Gurmukhs have saved so very many, O Saints. ||1||Pause||<br>
  He conquers attachment, and eradicates egotism, and sees Your Divine Light pervading the three worlds, Lord. ||2||<br>
  He conquers desire, and enshrines the Lord within his mind; he contemplates the Word of the True Guru's Shabad. ||3||<br>
  The horn of consciousness vibrates the unstruck sound current; Your Light illuminates each and every heart, Lord. ||4||<br>
  He plays the flute of the universe in his mind, and lights the fire of God. ||5||<br>
  Bringing together the five elements, day and night, the Lord's lamp shines with the Immaculate Light of the Infinite. ||6||<br>
  The right and left nostrils, the sun and the moon channels, are the strings of the body-harp; they vibrate the wondrous melody of the Shabad. ||7||<br>
  The true hermit obtains a seat in the City of God, the invisible, inaccessible, infinite. ||8||<br>
  The mind is the king of the city of the body; the five sources of knowledge dwell within it. ||9||<br>
  Seated in his home, this king chants the Shabad; he administers justice and virtue. ||10||<br>
  What can poor death or birth say to him? Conquering his mind, he remains dead while yet alive. ||11||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 033</h2></center>
  Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are manifestations of the One God. He Himself is the Doer of deeds. ||12||<br>
  One who purifies his body, crosses over the terrifying world-ocean; he contemplates the essence of his own soul. ||13||<br>
  Serving the Guru, he finds everlasting peace; deep within, the Shabad permeates him, coloring him with virtue. ||14||<br>
  The Giver of virtue unites with Himself, one who conquers egotism and desire. ||15||<br>
  Eradicating the three qualities, dwell in the fourth state. This is the unparalleled devotional worship. ||16||<br>
  This is the Yoga of the Gurmukh: Through the Shabad, he understands his own soul, and he enshrines within his heart the One Lord. ||17||<br>
  Imbued with the Shabad, his mind becomes steady and stable; this is the most excellent action. ||18||<br>
  This true hermit does not enter into religious debates or hypocrisy; the Gurmukh contemplates the Shabad. ||19||<br>
  The Gurmukh practices Yoga - he is the true hermit; he practices abstinence and truth, and contemplates the Shabad. ||20||<br>
  One who dies in the Shabad and conquers his mind is the true hermit; he understands the Way of Yoga. ||21||<br>
  Attachment to Maya is the terrifying world-ocean; through the Shabad, the true hermit saves himself, and his ancestors as well. ||22||<br>
  Contemplating the Shabad, you shall be a hero throughout the four ages, O hermit; contemplate the Word of the Guru's Bani in devotion. ||23||<br>
  This mind is enticed by Maya, O hermit; contemplating the Shabad, you shall find release. ||24||<br>
  He Himself forgives, and unites in His Union; Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary, Lord. ||25||9||<br>
  Raamkalee, Third Mehl, Ashtapadees:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Make humility your ear-rings, Yogi, and compassion your patched coat.<br>
  Let coming and going be the ashes you apply to your body, Yogi, and then you shall conquer the three worlds. ||1||<br>
  Play that harp, Yogi,<br>
  which vibrates the unstruck sound current, and remain lovingly absorbed in the Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Make truth and contentment your plate and pouch, Yogi; take the Ambrosial Naam as your food.<br>
  Make meditation your walking stick, Yogi, and make higher consciousness the horn you blow. ||2||<br>
  Make your stable mind the Yogic posture you sit in, Yogi, and then you shall be rid of your tormenting desires.<br>
  Go begging in the village of the body, Yogi, and then, you shall obtain the Naam in your lap. ||3||<br>
  This harp does not center you in meditation, Yogi, nor does it bring the True Name into your lap.<br>
  This harp does not bring you peace, Yogi, nor eliminate egotism from within you. ||4||<br>
  Make the Fear of God, and the Love of God, the two gourds of your lute, Yogi, and make this body its neck.<br>
  Become Gurmukh, and then vibrate the strings; in this way, your desires shall depart. ||5||<br>
  One who understands the Hukam of the Lord's Command is called a Yogi; he links his consciousness to the One Lord.<br>
  His cynicism is dispelled, and he becomes immaculately pure; this is how he finds the Way of Yoga. ||6||<br>
  Everything that comes into view shall be destroyed; focus your consciousness on the Lord.<br>
  Enshrine love for the True Guru, and then you shall obtain this understanding. ||7||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 034</h2></center>
  This is not Yoga, O Yogi, to abandon your family and wander around.<br>
  The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is within the household of the body. By Guru's Grace, you shall find your Lord God. ||8||<br>
  This world is a puppet of clay, Yogi; the terrible disease, the desire for Maya is in it.<br>
  Making all sorts of efforts, and wearing religious robes, Yogi, this disease cannot be cured. ||9||<br>
  The Name of the Lord is the medicine, Yogi; the Lord enshrines it in the mind.<br>
  One who becomes Gurmukh understands this; he alone finds the Way of Yoga. ||10||<br>
  The Path of Yoga is very difficult, Yogi; he alone finds it, whom God blesses with His Grace.<br>
  Inside and outside, he sees the One Lord; he eliminates doubt from within himself. ||11||<br>
  So play the harp which vibrates without being played, Yogi.<br>
  Says Nanak, thus you shall be liberated, Yogi, and remain merged in the True Lord. ||12||1||10||<br>
  Raamkalee, Third Mehl:<br>
  The treasure of devotional worship is revealed to the Gurmukh; the True Guru has inspired me to understand this understanding. ||1||<br>
  O Saints, the Gurmukh is blessed with glorious greatness. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Dwelling always in Truth, celestial peace wells up; sexual desire and anger are eliminated from within. ||2||<br>
  Eradicating self-conceit, remain lovingly focused on the Naam, the Name of the Lord; through the Word of the Shabad, burn away possessiveness. ||3||<br>
  By Him we are created, and by Him we are destroyed; in the end, the Naam will be our only help and support. ||4||<br>
  He is ever-present; don't think that He is far away. He created the creation. ||5||<br>
  Deep within your heart, chant the True Word of the Shabad; remain lovingly absorbed in the True Lord. ||6||<br>
  The Priceless Naam is in the Society of the Saints; by great good fortune, it is obtained. ||7||<br>
  Do not be deluded by doubt; serve the True Guru, and keep your mind steady in one place. ||8||<br>
  Without the Name, everyone wanders around in confusion; they waste away their lives in vain. ||9||<br>
  Yogi, you have lost the Way; you wander around confused. Through hypocrisy, Yoga is not attained. ||10||<br>
  Sitting in Yogic postures in the City of God, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, you shall find Yoga. ||11||<br>
  Restrain your restless wanderings through the Shabad, and the Naam will come to dwell in your mind. ||12||<br>
  This body is a pool, O Saints; bathe in it, and enshrine love for the Lord. ||13||<br>
  Those who cleanse themselves through the Naam, are the most immaculate people; through the Shabad, they wash off their filth. ||14||<br>
  Trapped by the three qualities, the unconscious person does not think of the Naam; without the Name, he wastes away. ||15||<br>
  The three forms of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are trapped in the three qualities, lost in confusion. ||16||<br>
  By Guru's Grace, this triad is eradicated, and one is lovingly absorbed in the fourth state. ||17||<br>
  The Pandits, the religious scholars, read, study and discuss the arguments; they do not understand. ||18||<br>
  Engrossed in corruption, they wander in confusion; who can they possibly instruct, O Siblings of Destiny? ||19||<br>
  The Bani, the Word of the humble devotee is the most sublime and exalted; it prevails throughout the ages. ||20||<br>
  One who is committed to this Bani is emancipated, and through the Shabad, merges in Truth. ||21||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 035</h2></center>
  One who searches the village of the body, through the Shabad, obtains the nine treasures of the Naam. ||22||<br>
  Conquering desire, the mind is absorbed in intuitive ease, and then one chants the Lord's Praises without speaking. ||23||<br>
  Let your eyes gaze upon the Wondrous Lord; let your consciousness be attached to the Unseen Lord. ||24||<br>
  The Unseen Lord is forever absolute and immaculate; one's light merges into the Light. ||25||<br>
  I praise my Guru forever, who has inspired me to understand this true understanding. ||26||<br>
  Nanak offers this one prayer: through the Name, may I find salvation and honor. ||27||2||11||<br>
  Raamkalee, Third Mehl:<br>
  It is so hard to obtain that devotional worship of the Lord, O Saints. It cannot be described at all. ||1||<br>
  O Saints, as Gurmukh, find the Perfect Lord,<br>
  and worship the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Without the Lord, everything is filthy, O Saints; what offering should I place before Him? ||2||<br>
  Whatever pleases the True Lord is devotional worship; His Will abides in the mind. ||3||<br>
  Everyone worships Him, O Saints, but the self-willed manmukh is not accepted or approved. ||4||<br>
  If someone dies in the Word of the Shabad, his mind become immaculate, O Saints; such worship is accepted and approved. ||5||<br>
  Sanctified and pure are those true beings, who enshrine love for the Shabad. ||6||<br>
  There is no worship of the Lord, other than the Name; the world wanders, deluded by doubt. ||7||<br>
  The Gurmukh understands his own self, O Saints; he lolvingly centers his mind on the Lord's Name. ||8||<br>
  The Immaculate Lord Himself inspires worship of Him; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, it is accepted and approved. ||9||<br>
  Those who worship Him, but do not know the Way, are polluted with the love of duality. ||10||<br>
  One who becomes Gurmukh, knows what worship is; the Lord's Will abides within his mind. ||11||<br>
  One who accepts the Lord's Will obtains total peace, O Saints; in the end, the Naam will be our help and support. ||12||<br>
  One who does not understand his own self, O Saints, falsely flatters himself. ||13||<br>
  The Messenger of Death does not give up on those who practices hypocrisy; they are dragged away in disgrace. ||14||<br>
  Those who have the Shabad deep within, understand themselves; they find the way of salvation. ||15||<br>
  Their minds enter into the deepest state of Samaadhi, and their light is absorbed into the Light. ||16||<br>
  The Gurmukhs listen constantly to the Naam, and chant it in the True Congregation. ||17||<br>
  The Gurmukhs sing the Lord's Praises, and erase self-conceit; they obtain true honor in the Court of the Lord. ||18||<br>
  True are their words; they speak only the Truth; they lovingly focus on the True Name. ||19||<br>
  My God is the Destroyer of fear, the Destroyer of sin; in the end, He is our only help and support. ||20||<br>
  He Himself pervades and permeates everything; O Nanak, glorious greatness is obtained through the Naam. ||21||3||12||<br>
  Raamkalee, Third Mehl:<br>
  I am filthy and polluted, proud and egotistical; receiving the Word of the Shabad, my filth is taken away. ||1||<br>
  O Saints, the Gurmukhs are saved through the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<br>
  The True Name abides deep within their hearts. The Creator Himself embellishes them. ||1||Pause||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 036</h2></center>
  Touching the philosopher's stone, they themselves become the philosopher's stone; the Dear Lord Himself blesses them with His Mercy. ||2||<br>
  Some wear religious robes, and wander around in pride; they lose their life in the gamble. ||3||<br>
  Some worship the Lord in devotion, night and day; day and night, they keep the Lord's Name enshrined in their hearts. ||4||<br>
  Those who are imbued with Him night and day, are spontaneously intoxicated with Him; they intuitively conquer their ego. ||5||<br>
  Without the Fear of God, devotional worship is never performed; through the Love and the Fear of God, devotional worship is embellished. ||6||<br>
  The Shabad burns away emotional attachment to Maya, and then one contemplates the essence of spiritual wisdom. ||7||<br>
  The Creator Himself inspires us to act; He Himself blesses us with His treasure. ||8||<br>
  The limits of His virtues cannot be found; I sing His Praises and contemplate the Word of the Shabad. ||9||<br>
  I chant the Lord's Name, and praise my Dear Lord; egotism is eradicated from within me. ||10||<br>
  The treasure of the Naam is obtained from the Guru; the treasures of the True Lord are inexhaustible. ||11||<br>
  He Himself is pleased with His devotees; by His Grace, He infuses His strength within them. ||12||<br>
  They always feel hunger for the True Name; they sing and contemplate the Shabad. ||13||<br>
  Soul, body and everything are His; it is so difficult to speak of, and contemplate Him. ||14||<br>
  Those humble beings who are attached to the Shabad are saved; they cross over the terrifying world-ocean. ||15||<br>
  Without the True Lord, no one can cross over; how rare are those who contemplate and understand this. ||16||<br>
  We obtain only that which is pre-ordained; receiving the Lord's Shabad, we are embellished. ||17||<br>
  Imbued with the Shabad, the body becomes golden, and loves only the True Name. ||18||<br>
  The body is then filled to overflowing with Ambrosial Nectar, obtained by contemplating the Shabad. ||19||<br>
  Those who seek God, find Him; others burst and die from their own egotism. ||20||<br>
  The debaters waste away, while the servants serve, with love and affection for the Guru. ||21||<br>
  He alone is a Yogi, who contemplates the essence of spiritual wisdom, and conquers egotism and thirsty desire. ||22||<br>
  The True Guru, the Great Giver, is revealed to those upon whom You bestow Your Grace, O Lord. ||23||<br>
  Those who do not serve the True Guru, and who are attached to Maya, are drowned; they die in their own egotism. ||24||<br>
  As long as there is breath within you, so long you should serve the Lord; then, you will go and meet the Lord. ||25||<br>
  Night and day, she remains awake and aware, day and night; she is the darling bride of her Beloved Husband Lord. ||26||<br>
  I offer my body and mind in sacrifice to my Guru; I am a sacrifice to Him. ||27||<br>
  Attachment to Maya will end and go away; only by contemplating the Shabad will you be saved. ||28||<br>
  They are awake and aware, whom the Lord Himself awakens; so contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||29||<br>
  O Nanak, those who do not remember the Naam are dead. The devotees live in contemplative meditation. ||30||4||13||<br>
  Raamkalee, Third Mehl:<br>
  Receiving the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, from the Guru, I remain satisfied and fulfilled. ||1||<br>
  O Saints, the Gurmukhs attain the state of liberation.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 037</h2></center>
  The One Name abides deep within my heart; such is the glorious greatness of the Perfect Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  He Himself is the Creator, and He Himself is the Enjoyer. He Himself gives sustenance to all. ||2||<br>
  Whatever He wants to do, He is doing; no one else can do anything. ||3||<br>
  He Himself fashions and creates the creation; He links each and every person to their task. ||4||<br>
  If you serve Him, then you will find peace; the True Guru will unite you in His Union. ||5||<br>
  The Lord Himself creates Himself; the Unseen Lord cannot be seen. ||6||<br>
  He Himself kills, and brings back to life; He does not have even an iota of greed. ||7||<br>
  Some are made givers, and some are made beggars; He Himself inspires us to devotional worship. ||8||<br>
  Those who know the One Lord are very fortunate; they remain absorbed in the True Lord. ||9||<br>
  He Himself is beautiful, He Himself is wise and clever; His worth cannot be expressed. ||10||<br>
  He Himself infuses pain and pleasure; He Himself makes them wander around in doubt. ||11||<br>
  The Great Giver is revealed to the Gurmukh; without the Guru, the world wanders in darkness. ||12||<br>
  Those who taste, enjoy the flavor; the True Guru imparts this understanding. ||13||<br>
  Some, the Lord causes to forget and lose the Name; others become Gurmukh, and are granted this understanding. ||14||<br>
  Forever and ever, praise the Lord, O Saints; how glorious is His greatness! ||15||<br>
  There is no other King except Him; He administers justice, as He has made it. ||16||<br>
  His justice is always True; how rare are those who accept His Command. ||17||<br>
  O mortal, meditate forever on the Lord, who has made the Gurmukh in His making. ||18||<br>
  That humble being who meets with the True Guru is fulfilled; the Naam abides in his heart. ||19||<br>
  The True Lord is Himself forever True; He announces His Bani, the Word of His Shabad. ||20||<br>
  Nanak is wonderstruck, hearing and seeing His Lord; my God is all-pervading, everywhere. ||21||5||14||<br>

  In an instant, He establishes and disestablishes, by His Creative Power. All is the Creation of the Creator. ||2||<br>
  Sexual desire, anger, greed, falsehood and slander are banished in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||3||<br>
  Chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the mind becomes immaculate, and life is passed in absolute peace. ||4||<br>
  That mortal who enters the Sanctuary of the devotees, does not lose out, here or hereafter. ||5||<br>
  Pleasure and pain, and the condition of this mind, I place before You, Lord. ||6||<br>
  You are the Giver of all beings; You cherish what You have made. ||7||<br>
  So many millions of times, Nanak is a sacrifice to Your humble servants. ||8||5||<br>
  Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl, Ashtapadee:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Receiving the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, all sins are erased, and He unites me with the Lord. ||1||<br>
  My Guru is the Transcendent Lord, the Giver of peace.<br>
  He implants the Naam, the Name of the Supreme Lord God within us; in the end, He is our help and support. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The source of all pain within is destroyed; I apply the dust of the feet of the Saints to my forehead. ||2||<br>
  In an instant, He purifies the sinners, and dispels the darkness of ignorance. ||3||<br>
  The Lord is all-powerful, the Cause of causes. Nanak seeks His Sanctuary. ||4||<br>
  Shattering the bonds, the Guru implants the Lord's lotus feet within, and lovingly attunes us to the One Word of the Shabad. ||5||<br>
  He has lifted me up, and pulled me out of the deep, dark pit of sin; I am attuned to the True Shabad. ||6||<br>
  The fear of birth and death is taken away; I shall never wander again. ||7||<br>
  This mind is imbued with the sublime elixir of the Naam; drinking in the Ambrosial Nectar, it is satisfied. ||8||<br>
  Joining the Society of the Saints, I sing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises; I dwell in the eternal, unchanging place. ||9||<br>
  The Perfect Guru has given me the perfect teachings; there is nothing except the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny. ||10||<br>
  I have obtained the treasure of the Naam, by great good fortune; O Nanak, I shall not fall into hell. ||11||<br>
  Clever tricks have not worked for me; I shall act according to the Instructions of the Perfect Guru. ||12||<br>
  He is chanting, intense meditation, austere self-discipline and purification. He Himself acts, and causes us to act. ||13||<br>
  In the midst of children and spouse, and utter corruption, the True Guru has carried me across. ||14||<br>

  You Yourself take care of Your beings; You Yourself attach them to the hem of Your robe. ||15||<br>
  I have built the boat of true Dharmic faith, to cross over the terrifying world-ocean. ||16||<br>
  The Lord Master is unlimited and endless; Nanak is a sacrifice, a sacrifice to Him. ||17||<br>
  Being of Immortal Manifestation, He is not born; He is self-existent; He is the Light in the darkness of Kali Yuga. ||18||<br>
  He is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, the Giver of souls; gazing upon Him, I am satisfied and fulfilled. ||19||<br>
  He is the One Universal Creator Lord, immaculate and fearless; He is permeating and pervading all the water and the land. ||20||<br>
  He blesses His devotees with the Gift of devotional worship; Nanak longs for the Lord, O my mother. ||21||1||6||<br>
  Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl,<br>
  Shalok:<br>
  Study the Word of the Shabad, O beloveds. It is your anchoring support in life and in death.<br>
  Your face shall be radiant, and you will be at peace forever, O Nanak, meditating in remembrance on the One Lord. ||1||<br>
  My mind and body are imbued with my Beloved Lord; I have been blessed with loving devotion to the Lord, O Saints. ||1||<br>
  The True Guru has approved my cargo, O Saints.<br>
  He has blessed His slave with the profit of the Lord's Name; all my thirst is quenched, O Saints. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Searching and searching, I have found the One Lord, the jewel; I cannot express His value, O Saints. ||2||<br>
  I focus my meditation on His Lotus Feet; I am absorbed in the True Vision of His Darshan, O Saints. ||3||<br>
  Singing, singing His Glorious Praises, I am enraptured; meditating in remembrance on the Lord, I am satisfied and fulfilled, O Saints. ||4||<br>
  The Lord, the Supreme Soul, is permeating within all; what comes, and what goes, O Saints? ||5||<br>
  At the very beginning of time, and throughout the ages, He is, and He shall always be; He is the Giver of peace to all beings, O Saints. ||6||<br>
  He Himself is endless; His end cannot be found. He is totally pervading and permeating everywhere, O Saints. ||7||<br>
  Nanak: the Lord is my friend, companion, wealth, youth, son, father and mother, O Saints. ||8||2||7||<br>
  Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  In thought, word and deed, I contemplate the Lord's Name.<br>
  The horrible world-ocean is very treacherous; O Nanak, the Gurmukh is carried across. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Inwardly, peace, and outwardly, peace; meditating on the Lord, evil tendencies are crushed. ||1||<br>
  He has rid me of what was clinging to me; my Dear Lord God has blessed me with His Grace. ||2||<br>
  The Saints are saved, in His Sanctuary; the very egotistical people rot away and die. ||3||<br>
  In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I have obtained this fruit, the Support of the One Name alone. ||4||<br>
  No one is strong, and no one is weak; all are manifestations of Your Light, Lord. ||5||<br>
  You are the all-powerful, indescribable, unfathomable, all-pervading Lord. ||6||<br>
  Who can estimate Your value, O Creator Lord? God has no end or limitation. ||7||<br>
  Please bless Nanak with the glorious greatness of the gift of the Naam, and the dust of the feet of Your Saints. ||8||3||8||22||<br>

  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  I am in ecstasy, O my mother, for I have found my True Guru.<br>
  I have found the True Guru, with intuitive ease, and my mind vibrates with the music of bliss.<br>
  The jewelled melodies and their related celestial harmonies have come to sing the Word of the Shabad.<br>
  The Lord dwells within the minds of those who sing the Shabad.<br>
  Says Nanak, I am in ecstasy, for I have found my True Guru. ||1||<br>
  O my mind, remain always with the Lord.<br>
  Remain always with the Lord, O my mind, and all sufferings will be forgotten.<br>
  He will accept You as His own, and all your affairs will be perfectly arranged.<br>
  Our Lord and Master is all-powerful to do all things, so why forget Him from your mind?<br>
  Says Nanak, O my mind, remain always with the Lord. ||2||<br>
  O my True Lord and Master, what is there which is not in Your celestial home?<br>
  Everything is in Your home; they receive, unto whom You give.<br>
  Constantly singing Your Praises and Glories, Your Name is enshrined in the mind.<br>
  The divine melody of the Shabad vibrates for those, within whose minds the Naam abides.<br>
  Says Nanak, O my True Lord and Master, what is there which is not in Your home? ||3||<br>
  The True Name is my only support.<br>
  The True Name is my only support; it satisfies all hunger.<br>
  It has brought peace and tranquility to my mind; it has fulfilled all my desires.<br>
  I am forever a sacrifice to the Guru, who possesses such glorious greatness.<br>
  Says Nanak, listen, O Saints; enshrine love for the Shabad.<br>
  The True Name is my only support. ||4||<br>
  The Panch Shabad, the five primal sounds, vibrate in that blessed house.<br>
  In that blessed house, the Shabad vibrates; He infuses His almighty power into it.<br>
  Through You, we subdue the five demons of desire, and slay Death, the torturer.<br>
  Those who have such pre-ordained destiny are attached to the Lord's Name.<br>
  Says Nanak, they are at peace, and the unstruck sound current vibrates within their homes. ||5||<br>
  Without the true love of devotion, the body is without honor.<br>
  The body is dishonored without devotional love; what can the poor wretches do?<br>
  No one except You is all-powerful; please bestow Your Mercy, O Lord of all nature.<br>
  There is no place of rest, other than the Name; attached to the Shabad, we are embellished with beauty.<br>
  Says Nanak, without devotional love, what can the poor wretches do? ||6||<br>
  Bliss, bliss - everyone talks of bliss; bliss is known only through the Guru.<br>
  Eternal bliss in known only through the Guru, when the Beloved Lord grants His Grace.<br>
  Granting His Grace, He cuts away our sins; He blesses us with the healing ointment of spiritual wisdom.<br>
  Those who eradicate attachment from within themselves, are adorned with the Shabad, the Word of the True Lord.<br>
  Says Nanak, this alone is bliss - bliss which is known through the Guru. ||7||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 043</h2></center>
  O Baba, he alone receives it, unto whom You give it.<br>
  He alone receives it, unto whom You give it; what can the other poor wretched beings do?<br>
  Some are deluded by doubt, wandering in the ten directions; some are adorned with attachment to the Naam.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, the mind becomes immaculate and pure, for those who follow God's Will.<br>
  Says Nanak, he alone receives it, unto whom You give it, O Beloved Lord. ||8||<br>
  Come, Beloved Saints, let us speak the Unspoken Speech of the Lord.<br>
  How can we speak the Unspoken Speech of the Lord? Through which door will we find Him?<br>
  Surrender body, mind, wealth, and everything to the Guru; obey the Order of His Will, and you will find Him.<br>
  Obey the Hukam of the Guru's Command, and sing the True Word of His Bani.<br>
  Says Nanak, listen, O Saints, and speak the Unspoken Speech of the Lord. ||9||<br>
  O fickle mind, through cleverness, no one has found the Lord.<br>
  Through cleverness, no one has found Him; listen, O my mind.<br>
  This Maya is so fascinating; because of it, people wander in doubt.<br>
  This fascinating Maya was created by the One who has administered this potion.<br>
  I am a sacrifice to the One who has made emotional attachment sweet.<br>
  Says Nanak, O fickle mind, no one has found Him through cleverness. ||10||<br>
  O beloved mind, contemplate the True Lord forever.<br>
  This family which you see shall not go along with you.<br>
  They shall not go along with you, so why do you focus your attention on them?<br>
  Don't do anything that you will regret in the end.<br>
  Listen to the Teachings of the True Guru - these shall go along with you.<br>
  Says Nanak, O beloved mind, contemplate the True Lord forever. ||11||<br>
  O inaccessible and unfathomable Lord, Your limits cannot be found.<br>
  No one has found Your limits; only You Yourself know.<br>
  All living beings and creatures are Your play; how can anyone describe You?<br>
  You speak, and You gaze upon all; You created the Universe.<br>
  Says Nanak, You are forever inaccessible; Your limits cannot be found. ||12||<br>
  The angelic beings and the silent sages search for the Ambrosial Nectar; this Amrit is obtained from the Guru.<br>
  This Amrit is obtained, when the Guru grants His Grace; He enshrines the True Lord within the mind.<br>
  All living beings and creatures were created by You; only some come to see the Guru, and seek His blessing.<br>
  Their greed, avarice and egotism are dispelled, and the True Guru seems sweet.<br>
  Says Nanak, those with whom the Lord is pleased, obtain the Amrit, through the Guru. ||13||<br>
  The lifestyle of the devotees is unique and distinct.<br>
  The devotees' lifestyle is unique and distinct; they follow the most difficult path.<br>
  They renounce greed, avarice, egotism and desire; they do not talk too much.<br>
  The path they take is sharper than a two-edged sword, and finer than a hair.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 044</h2></center>
  By Guru's Grace, they shed their selfishness and conceit; their hopes are merged in the Lord.<br>
  Says Nanak, the lifestyle of the devotees, in each and every age, is unique and distinct. ||14||<br>
  As You make me walk, so do I walk, O my Lord and Master; what else do I know of Your Glorious Virtues?<br>
  As You cause them to walk, they walk - You have placed them on the Path.<br>
  In Your Mercy, You attach them to the Naam; they meditate forever on the Lord, Har, Har.<br>
  Those whom You cause to listen to Your sermon, find peace in the Gurdwara, the Guru's Gate.<br>
  Says Nanak, O my True Lord and Master, you make us walk according to Your Will. ||15||<br>
  This song of praise is the Shabad, the most beautiful Word of God.<br>
  This beauteous Shabad is the everlasting song of praise, spoken by the True Guru.<br>
  This is enshrined in the minds of those who are so pre-destined by the Lord.<br>
  Some wander around, babbling on and on, but none obtain Him by babbling.<br>
  Says Nanak, the Shabad, this song of praise, has been spoken by the True Guru. ||16||<br>
  Those humble beings who meditate on the Lord become pure.<br>
  Meditating on the Lord, they become pure; as Gurmukh, they meditate on Him.<br>
  They are pure, along with their mothers, fathers, family and friends; all their companions are pure as well.<br>
  Pure are those who speak, and pure are those who listen; those who enshrine it within their minds are pure.<br>
  Says Nanak, pure and holy are those who, as Gurmukh, meditate on the Lord, Har, Har. ||17||<br>
  By religious rituals, intuitive poise is not found; without intuitive poise, skepticism does not depart.<br>
  Skepticism does not depart by contrived actions; everybody is tired of performing these rituals.<br>
  The soul is polluted by skepticism; how can it be cleansed?<br>
  Wash your mind by attaching it to the Shabad, and keep your consciousness focused on the Lord.<br>
  Says Nanak, by Guru's Grace, intuitive poise is produced, and this skepticism is dispelled. ||18||<br>
  Inwardly polluted, and outwardly pure.<br>
  Those who are outwardly pure and yet polluted within, lose their lives in the gamble.<br>
  They contract this terrible disease of desire, and in their minds, they forget about dying.<br>
  In the Vedas, the ultimate objective is the Naam, the Name of the Lord; but they do not hear this, and they wander around like demons.<br>
  Says Nanak, those who forsake Truth and cling to falsehood, lose their lives in the gamble. ||19||<br>
  Inwardly pure, and outwardly pure.<br>
  Those who are outwardly pure and also pure within, through the Guru, perform good deeds.<br>
  Not even an iota of falsehood touches them; their hopes are absorbed in the Truth.<br>
  Those who earn the jewel of this human life, are the most excellent of merchants.<br>
  Says Nanak, those whose minds are pure, abide with the Guru forever. ||20||<br>
  If a Sikh turns to the Guru with sincere faith, as sunmukh<br>
  - if a Sikh turns to the Guru with sincere faith, as sunmukh, his soul abides with the Guru.<br>
  Within his heart, he meditates on the lotus feet of the Guru; deep within his soul, he contemplates Him.<br>
  Renouncing selfishness and conceit, he remains always on the side of the Guru; he does not know anyone except the Guru.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 045</h2></center>
  Says Nanak, listen, O Saints: such a Sikh turns toward the Guru with sincere faith, and becomes sunmukh. ||21||<br>
  One who turns away from the Guru, and becomes baymukh - without the True Guru, he shall not find liberation.<br>
  He shall not find liberation anywhere else either; go and ask the wise ones about this.<br>
  He shall wander through countless incarnations; without the True Guru, he shall not find liberation.<br>
  But liberation is attained, when one is attached to the feet of the True Guru, chanting the Word of the Shabad.<br>
  Says Nanak, contemplate this and see, that without the True Guru, there is no liberation. ||22||<br>
  Come, O beloved Sikhs of the True Guru, and sing the True Word of His Bani.<br>
  Sing the Guru's Bani, the supreme Word of Words.<br>
  Those who are blessed by the Lord's Glance of Grace - their hearts are imbued with this Bani.<br>
  Drink in this Ambrosial Nectar, and remain in the Lord's Love forever; meditate on the Lord, the Sustainer of the world.<br>
  Says Nanak, sing this True Bani forever. ||23||<br>
  Without the True Guru, other songs are false.<br>
  The songs are false without the True Guru; all other songs are false.<br>
  The speakers are false, and the listeners are false; those who speak and recite are false.<br>
  They may continually chant, 'Har, Har' with their tongues, but they do not know what they are saying.<br>
  Their consciousness is lured by Maya; they are just reciting mechanically.<br>
  Says Nanak, without the True Guru, other songs are false. ||24||<br>
  The Word of the Guru's Shabad is a jewel, studded with diamonds.<br>
  The mind which is attached to this jewel, merges into the Shabad.<br>
  One whose mind is attuned to the Shabad, enshrines love for the True Lord.<br>
  He Himself is the diamond, and He Himself is the jewel; one who is blessed, understands its value.<br>
  Says Nanak, the Shabad is a jewel, studded with diamonds. ||25||<br>
  He Himself created Shiva and Shakti, mind and matter; the Creator subjects them to His Command.<br>
  Enforcing His Order, He Himself sees all. How rare are those who, as Gurmukh, come to know Him.<br>
  They break their bonds, and attain liberation; they enshrine the Shabad within their minds.<br>
  Those whom the Lord Himself makes Gurmukh, lovingly focus their consciousness on the One Lord.<br>
  Says Nanak, He Himself is the Creator; He Himself reveals the Hukam of His Command. ||26||<br>
  The Simritees and the Shaastras discriminate between good and evil, but they do not know the true essence of reality.<br>
  They do not know the true essence of reality without the Guru; they do not know the true essence of reality.<br>
  The world is asleep in the three modes and doubt; it passes the night of its life sleeping.<br>
  Those humble beings remain awake and aware, within whose minds, by Guru's Grace, the Lord abides; they chant the Ambrosial Word of the Guru's Bani.<br>
  Says Nanak, they alone obtain the essence of reality, who night and day remain lovingly absorbed in the Lord; they pass the night of their life awake and aware. ||27||<br>
  He nourished us in the mother's womb; why forget Him from the mind?<br>
  Why forget from the mind such a Great Giver, who gave us sustenance in the fire of the womb?<br>
  Nothing can harm one, whom the Lord inspires to embrace His Love.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 046</h2></center>
  He Himself is the love, and He Himself is the embrace; the Gurmukh contemplates Him forever.<br>
  Says Nanak, why forget such a Great Giver from the mind? ||28||<br>
  As is the fire within the womb, so is Maya outside.<br>
  The fire of Maya is one and the same; the Creator has staged this play.<br>
  According to His Will, the child is born, and the family is very pleased.<br>
  Love for the Lord wears off, and the child becomes attached to desires; the script of Maya runs its course.<br>
  This is Maya, by which the Lord is forgotten; emotional attachment and love of duality well up.<br>
  Says Nanak, by Guru's Grace, those who enshrine love for the Lord find Him, in the midst of Maya. ||29||<br>
  The Lord Himself is priceless; His worth cannot be estimated.<br>
  His worth cannot be estimated, even though people have grown weary of trying.<br>
  If you meet such a True Guru, offer your head to Him; your selfishness and conceit will be eradicated from within.<br>
  Your soul belongs to Him; remain united with Him, and the Lord will come to dwell in your mind.<br>
  The Lord Himself is priceless; very fortunate are those, O Nanak, who attain to the Lord. ||30||<br>
  The Lord is my capital; my mind is the merchant.<br>
  The Lord is my capital, and my mind is the merchant; through the True Guru, I know my capital.<br>
  Meditate continually on the Lord, Har, Har, O my soul, and you shall collect your profits daily.<br>
  This wealth is obtained by those who are pleasing to the Lord's Will.<br>
  Says Nanak, the Lord is my capital, and my mind is the merchant. ||31||<br>
  O my tongue, you are engrossed in other tastes, but your thirsty desire is not quenched.<br>
  Your thirst shall not be quenched by any means, until you attain the subtle essence of the Lord.<br>
  If you do obtain the subtle essence of the Lord, and drink in this essence of the Lord, you shall not be troubled by desire again.<br>
  This subtle essence of the Lord is obtained by good karma, when one comes to meet with the True Guru.<br>
  Says Nanak, all other tastes and essences are forgotten, when the Lord comes to dwell within the mind. ||32||<br>
  O my body, the Lord infused His Light into you, and then you came into the world.<br>
  The Lord infused His Light into you, and then you came into the world.<br>
  The Lord Himself is your mother, and He Himself is your father; He created the created beings, and revealed the world to them.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, some understand, and then it's a show; it seems like just a show.<br>
  Says Nanak, He laid the foundation of the Universe, and infused His Light, and then you came into the world. ||33||<br>
  My mind has become joyful, hearing of God's coming.<br>
  Sing the songs of joy to welcome the Lord, O my companions; my household has become the Lord's Mansion.<br>
  Sing continually the songs of joy to welcome the Lord, O my companions, and sorrow and suffering will not afflict you.<br>
  Blessed is that day, when I am attached to the Guru's feet and meditate on my Husband Lord.<br>
  I have come to know the unstruck sound current and the Word of the Guru's Shabad; I enjoy the sublime essence of the Lord, the Lord's Name.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 047</h2></center>
  Says Nanak, God Himself has met me; He is the Doer, the Cause of causes. ||34||<br>
  O my body, why have you come into this world? What actions have you committed?<br>
  And what actions have you committed, O my body, since you came into this world?<br>
  The Lord who formed your form - you have not enshrined that Lord in your mind.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, the Lord abides within the mind, and one's pre-ordained destiny is fulfilled.<br>
  Says Nanak, this body is adorned and honored, when one's consciousness is focused on the True Guru. ||35||<br>
  O my eyes, the Lord has infused His Light into you; do not look upon any other than the Lord.<br>
  Do not look upon any other than the Lord; the Lord alone is worthy of beholding.<br>
  This whole world which you see is the image of the Lord; only the image of the Lord is seen.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, I understand, and I see only the One Lord; there is no one except the Lord.<br>
  Says Nanak, these eyes were blind; but meeting the True Guru, they became all-seeing. ||36||<br>
  O my ears, you were created only to hear the Truth.<br>
  To hear the Truth, you were created and attached to the body; listen to the True Bani.<br>
  Hearing it, the mind and body are rejuvenated, and the tongue is absorbed in Ambrosial Nectar.<br>
  The True Lord is unseen and wondrous; His state cannot be described.<br>
  Says Nanak, listen to the Ambrosial Naam and become holy; you were created only to hear the Truth. ||37||<br>
  The Lord placed the soul to the cave of the body, and blew the breath of life into the musical instrument of the body.<br>
  He blew the breath of life into the musical instrument of the body, and revealed the nine doors; but He kept the Tenth Door hidden.<br>
  Through the Gurdwara, the Guru's Gate, some are blessed with loving faith, and the Tenth Door is revealed to them.<br>
  There are many images of the Lord, and the nine treasures of the Naam; His limits cannot be found.<br>
  Says Nanak, the Lord placed the soul to the cave of the body, and blew the breath of life into the musical instrument of the body. ||38||<br>
  Sing this true song of praise in the true home of your soul.<br>
  Sing the song of praise in your true home; meditate there on the True Lord forever.<br>
  They alone meditate on You, O True Lord, who are pleasing to Your Will; as Gurmukh, they understand.<br>
  This Truth is the Lord and Master of all; whoever is blessed, obtains it.<br>
  Says Nanak, sing the true song of praise in the true home of your soul. ||39||<br>
  Listen to the song of bliss, O most fortunate ones; all your longings shall be fulfilled.<br>
  I have obtained the Supreme Lord God, and all sorrows have been forgotten.<br>
  Pain, illness and suffering have departed, listening to the True Bani.<br>
  The Saints and their friends are in ecstasy, knowing the Perfect Guru.<br>
  Pure are the listeners, and pure are the speakers; the True Guru is all-pervading and permeating.<br>

  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  He is the Great Giver of the Universe, the Lover of His devotees, throughout the three worlds.<br>
  One who is merged in the Word of the Guru's Shabad does not know any other.<br>
  Dwelling upon the Word of the Guru's Shabad, he does not know any other; he meditates on the One Name of the Lord.<br>
  By the Grace of Guru Nanak and Guru Angad, Guru Amar Das obtained the supreme status.<br>
  And when the call came for Him to depart, He merged in the Name of the Lord.<br>
  Through devotional worship in this world, the imperishable, immovable, immeasurable Lord is found. ||1||<br>
  The Guru gladly accepted the Lord's Will, and so the Guru easily reached the Lord God's Presence.<br>
  The True Guru prays to the Lord, "Please, save my honor. This is my prayer".<br>
  Please save the honor of Your humble servant, O Lord; please bless him with Your Immaculate Name.<br>
  At this time of final departure, it is our only help and support; it destroys death, and the Messenger of Death.<br>
  The Lord God heard the prayer of the True Guru, and granted His request.<br>
  The Lord showered His Mercy, and blended the True Guru with Himself; He said, "Blessed! Blessed! Wonderful!"||2||<br>
  Listen O my Sikhs, my children and Siblings of Destiny; it is my Lord's Will that I must now go to Him.<br>
  The Guru gladly accepted the Lord's Will, and my Lord God applauded Him.<br>
  One who is pleased with the Lord God's Will is a devotee, the True Guru, the Primal Lord.<br>
  The unstruck sound current of bliss resounds and vibrates; the Lord hugs him close in His embrace.<br>
  O my children, siblings and family, look carefully in your minds, and see.<br>
  The pre-ordained death warrant cannot be avoided; the Guru is going to be with the Lord God. ||3||<br>
  The True Guru, in His Own Sweet Will, sat up and summoned His family.<br>
  Let no one weep for me after I am gone. That would not please me at all.<br>
  When a friend receives a robe of honor, then his friends are pleased with his honor.<br>
  Consider this and see, O my children and siblings; the Lord has given the True Guru the robe of supreme honor.<br>
  The True Guru Himself sat up, and appointed the successor to the Throne of Raja Yoga, the Yoga of Meditation and Success.<br>
  All the Sikhs, relatives, children and siblings have fallen at the Feet of Guru Ram Das. ||4||<br>
  Finally, the True Guru said, "When I am gone, sing Kirtan in Praise of the Lord, in Nirvaanaa."<br>
  Call in the long-haired scholarly Saints of the Lord, to read the sermon of the Lord, Har, Har.<br>
  Read the sermon of the Lord, and listen to the Lord's Name; the Guru is pleased with love for the Lord.<br>
  Do not bother with offering rice-balls on leaves, lighting lamps, and other rituals like floating the body out on the Ganges; instead, let my remains be given up to the Lord's Pool.<br>
  The Lord was pleased as the True Guru spoke; he was blended then with the all-knowing Primal Lord God.<br>
  The Guru then blessed the Sodhi Ram Das with the ceremonial tilak mark, the insignia of the True Word of the Shabad. ||5||<br>

  His son Mohri turned sunmukh, and become obedient to Him; he bowed, and touched Ram Das' feet.<br>
  Then, everyone bowed and touched the feet of Ram Das, into whom the Guru infused His essence.<br>
  And any that did not bow then because of envy - later, the True Guru brought them around to bow in humility.<br>
  It pleased the Guru, the Lord, to bestow glorious greatness upon Him; such was the pre-ordained destiny of the Lord's Will.<br>
  Says Sundar, listen, O Saints: all the world fell at His feet. ||6||1||<br>

  Beloved, the Lord my Beloved - with my eyes, I have seen the Lord, my Beloved!<br>
  With my eyes I have seen Him, sleeping upon the bed within each and every heart; my Beloved is the sweetest ambrosial nectar.<br>
  He is with all, but he cannot be found; the fool does not know His taste.<br>
  Intoxicated with the wine of Maya, the mortal babbles on about trivial affairs; giving in to the illusion, he cannot meet the Lord.<br>
  Says Nanak, without the Guru, he cannot understand the Lord, the Friend who is standing near everyone. ||1||<br>

  He created Maya, His slave, so powerfully pervasive - she has enticed all beings and creatures.<br>

  They meditate on Him, and find Him; they place all their pride in Him.<br>
  Says Nanak, He is seated on His eternal throne; True is His royal court. ||3||<br>
  The song of joy, the Lord's song of joy; listen to the song of joy of my God.<br>
  The wedding song, God's wedding song; the unstruck sound current of His wedding song resounds.<br>
  The unstruck sound current vibrates, and the Word of the Shabad resounds; there is continuous, continual rejoicing.<br>
  Meditating on that God, everything is obtained; He does not die, or come or go.<br>
  Thirst is quenched, and hopes are fulfilled; the Gurmukh meets with the absolute, unmanifest Lord.<br>
  Says Nanak, in the Home of my God, the songs of joy are continuously, continually heard. ||4||1||<br>

  The discarded bride is separated from His Love, and the Lord does not even look at her.<br>
  She does not see her Lord, and she dies with an aching sigh; she is defrauded and plundered by her great pride.<br>
  She flails around, like a fish out of water; attached to Maya, she is alienated from the Lord.<br>

  The rainy season is beautiful; the months of Saawan and Bhaadon bring bliss.<br>

  Without my Beloved Husband Lord, I find no peace, and all my necklaces and bracelets become cursed.<br>

  My Beloved has come into my home; I meditate on Him in my mind. The bed of my heart is beautifully adorned.<br>
  The woods, the meadows and the three worlds have blossomed forth in their greenery; gazing upon the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, I am fascinated.<br>
  I have met my Lord and Master, and my desires are fulfilled; my mind chants His Immaculate Mantra.<br>
  Prays Nanak, I celebrate continuously; I have met my Husband Lord, the Lord of excellence. ||7||<br>
  Shalok:<br>
  The Saints are the helpers, the support of the soul; they carry us cross the terrifying world-ocean.<br>

  Raamkalee, First Mehl, Dakhanee, Ongkaar:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  From Ongkaar, the One Universal Creator God, Brahma was created.<br>
  He kept Ongkaar in his consciousness.<br>
  From Ongkaar, the mountains and the ages were created.<br>
  Ongkaar created the Vedas.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 055</h2></center>
  Ongkaar saves the world through the Shabad.<br>
  Ongkaar saves the Gurmukhs.<br>
  Listen to the Message of the Universal, Imperishable Creator Lord.<br>
  The Universal, Imperishable Creator Lord is the essence of the three worlds. ||1||<br>
  Listen, O Pandit, O religious scholar, why are you writing about worldly debates?<br>
  As Gurmukh, write only the Name of the Lord, the Lord of the World. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Sassa: He created the entire universe with ease; His One Light pervades the three worlds.<br>
  Become Gurmukh, and obtain the real thing; gather the gems and pearls.<br>
  If one understands, realizes and comprehends what he reads and studies, in the end he shall realize that the True Lord dwells deep within his nucleus.<br>
  The Gurmukh sees and contemplates the True Lord; without the True Lord, the world is false. ||2||<br>
  Dhadha: Those who enshrine Dharmic faith and dwell in the City of Dharma are worthy; their minds are steadfast and stable.<br>
  Dhadha: If the dust of their feet touches one's face and forehead, he is transformed from iron into gold.<br>
  Blessed is the Support of the Earth; He Himself is not born; His measure and speech are perfect and True.<br>
  Only the Creator Himself knows His own extent; He alone knows the Brave Guru. ||3||<br>
  In love with duality, spiritual wisdom is lost; the mortal rots away in pride, and eats poison.<br>
  He thinks that the sublime essence of the Guru's song is useless, and he does not like to hear it. He loses the profound, unfathomable Lord.<br>
  Through the Guru's Words of Truth, the Ambrosial Nectar is obtained, and the mind and body find joy in the True Lord.<br>
  He Himself is the Gurmukh, and He Himself bestows the Ambrosial Nectar; He Himself leads us to drink it in. ||4||<br>
  Everyone says that God is the One and only, but they are engrossed in egotism and pride.<br>
  Realize that the One God is inside and outside; understand this, that the Mansion of His Presence is within the home of your heart.<br>
  God is near at hand; do not think that God is far away. The One Lord permeates the entire universe.<br>
  There in One Universal Creator Lord; there is no other at all. O Nanak, merge into the One Lord. ||5||<br>
  How can you keep the Creator under your control? He cannot be seized or measured.<br>
  Maya has made the mortal insane; she has administered the poisonous drug of falsehood.<br>
  Addicted to greed and avarice, the mortal is ruined, and then later, he regrets and repents.<br>
  So serve the One Lord, and attain the state of Salvation; your comings and goings shall cease. ||6||<br>
  The One Lord is in all actions, colors and forms.<br>
  He manifests in many shapes through wind, water and fire.<br>
  The One Soul wanders through the three worlds.<br>
  One who understands and comprehends the One Lord is honored.<br>
  One who gathers in spiritual wisdom and meditation, dwells in the state of balance.<br>
  How rare are those who, as Gurmukh, attain the One Lord.<br>
  They alone find peace, whom the Lord blesses with His Grace.<br>
  In the Gurdwara, the Guru's Door, they speak and hear of the Lord. ||7||<br>
  His Light illuminates the ocean and the earth.<br>
  Throughout the three worlds, is the Guru, the Lord of the World.<br>
  The Lord reveals His various forms;<br>
  granting His Grace, He enters the home of the heart.<br>
  The clouds hang low, and the rain is pouring down.<br>
  The Lord embellishes and exalts with the Sublime Word of the Shabad.<br>
  One who knows the mystery of the One God,<br>
  is Himself the Creator, Himself the Divine Lord. ||8||<br>
  When the sun rises, the demons are slain;<br>
  the mortal looks upwards, and contemplates the Shabad.<br>
  The Lord is beyond the beginning and the end, beyond the three worlds.<br>
  He Himself acts, speaks and listens.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 056</h2></center>
  He is the Architect of Destiny; He blesses us with mind and body.<br>
  That Architect of Destiny is in my mind and mouth.<br>
  God is the Life of the world; there is no other at all.<br>
  O Nanak, imbued with the Naam, the Name of the Lord, one is honored. ||9||<br>
  One who lovingly chants the Name of the Sovereign Lord King,<br>
  fights the battle and conquers his own mind;<br>
  day and night, he remains imbued with the Lord's Love.<br>
  He is famous throughout the three worlds and the four ages.<br>
  One who knows the Lord, becomes like Him.<br>
  He becomes absolutely immaculate, and his body is sanctified.<br>
  His heart is happy, in love with the One Lord.<br>
  He lovingly centers his attention deep within upon the True Word of the Shabad. ||10||<br>
  Don't be angry - drink in the Ambrosial Nectar; you shall not remain in this world forever.<br>
  The ruling kings and the paupers shall not remain; they come and go, throughout the four ages.<br>
  Everyone says that they will remain, but none of them remain; unto whom should I offer my prayer?<br>
  The One Shabad, the Name of the Lord, will never fail you; the Guru grants honor and understanding. ||11||<br>
  My shyness and hesitation have died and gone, and I walk with my face unveiled.<br>
  The confusion and doubt from my crazy, insane mother-in-law has been removed from over my head.<br>
  My Beloved has summoned me with joyful caresses; my mind is filled with the bliss of the Shabad.<br>
  Imbued with the Love of my Beloved, I have become Gurmukh, and carefree. ||12||<br>
  Chant the jewel of the Naam, and earn the profit of the Lord.<br>
  Greed, avarice, evil and egotism;<br>
  slander, inuendo and gossip;<br>
  the self-willed manmukh is blind, foolish and ignorant.<br>
  For the sake of earning the profit of the Lord, the mortal comes into the world.<br>
  But he becomes a mere slave laborer, and is mugged by the mugger, Maya.<br>
  One who earns the profit of the Naam, with the capital of faith,<br>
  O Nanak, is truly honored by the True Supreme King. ||13||<br>
  The world is ruined on the path of Death.<br>
  No one has the power to erase Maya's influence.<br>
  If wealth visits the home of the lowliest clown,<br>
  seeing that wealth, all pay their respects to him.<br>
  Even an idiot is thought of as clever, if he is rich.<br>
  Without devotional worship, the world is insane.<br>
  The One Lord is contained among all.<br>
  He reveals Himself, unto those whom He blesses with His Grace. ||14||<br>
  Throughout the ages, the Lord is eternally established; He has no vengeance.<br>
  He is not subject to birth and death; He is not entangled in worldly affairs.<br>
  Whatever is seen, is the Lord Himself.<br>
  Creating Himself, He establishes Himself in the heart.<br>
  He Himself is unfathomable; He links people to their affairs.<br>
  He is the Way of Yoga, the Life of the World.<br>
  Living a righteous lifestyle, true peace is found.<br>
  Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, how can anyone find liberation? ||15||<br>
  Without the Name, even one's own body is an enemy.<br>
  Why not meet the Lord, and take away the pain of your mind?<br>
  The traveller comes and goes along the highway.<br>
  What did he bring when he came, and what will he take away when he goes?<br>
  Without the Name, one loses everywhere.<br>
  The profit is earned, when the Lord grants understanding.<br>
  In merchandise and trade, the merchant is trading.<br>
  Without the Name, how can one find honor and nobility? ||16||<br>
  One who contemplates the Lord's Virtues is spiritually wise.<br>
  Through His Virtues, one receives spiritual wisdom.<br>
  How rare in this world, is the Giver of virtue.<br>
  The True way of life comes through contemplation of the Guru.<br>
  The Lord is inaccessible and unfathomable. His worth cannot be estimated.<br>

  The virtuous soul bride continually contemplates His Virtues.<br>
  O Nanak, following the Guru's Teachings, one meets the Lord, the true friend. ||17||<br>
  Unfulfilled sexual desire and unresolved anger waste the body away,<br>
  as gold is dissolved by borax.<br>
  The gold is touched to the touchstone, and tested by fire;<br>
  when its pure color shows through, it is pleasing to the eye of the assayer.<br>
  The world is a beast, and arrogent Death is the butcher.<br>
  The created beings of the Creator receive the karma of their actions.<br>
  He who created the world, knows its worth.<br>
  What else can be said? There is nothing at all to say. ||18||<br>
  Searching, searching, I drink in the Ambrosial Nectar.<br>
  I have adopted the way of tolerance, and given my mind to the True Guru.<br>
  Everyone calls himself true and genuine.<br>
  He alone is true, who obtains the jewel throughout the four ages.<br>
  Eating and drinking, one dies, but still does not know.<br>
  He dies in an instant, when he realizes the Word of the Shabad.<br>
  His consciousness becomes permanently stable, and his mind accepts death.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, he realizes the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||19||<br>
  The Profound Lord dwells in the sky of the mind, the Tenth Gate;<br>
  singing His Glorious Praises, one dwells in intuitive poise and peace.<br>
  He does not go to come, or come to go.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, he remains lovingly focused on the Lord.<br>
  The Lord of the mind-sky is inaccessible, independent and beyond birth.<br>
  The most worthy Samaadhi is to keep the consciousness stable, focused on Him.<br>
  Remembering the Lord's Name, one is not subject to reincarnation.<br>
  The Guru's Teachings are the most Excellent; all other ways lack the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||20||<br>
  Wandering to countless doorsteps and homes, I have grown weary.<br>
  My incarnations are countless, without limit.<br>
  I have had so many mothers and fathers, sons and daughters.<br>
  I have had so many gurus and disciples.<br>
  Through a false guru, liberation is not found.<br>
  There are so many brides of the One Husband Lord - consider this.<br>
  The Gurmukh dies, and lives with God.<br>
  Searching in the ten directions, I found Him within my own home.<br>
  I have met Him; the True Guru has led me to meet Him. ||21||<br>
  The Gurmukh sings, and the Gurmukh speaks.<br>
  The Gurmukh evaluates the value of the Lord, and inspires others to evaluate Him as well.<br>
  The Gurmukh comes and goes without fear.<br>
  His filth is taken away, and his stains are burnt off.<br>
  The Gurmukh contemplates the sound current of the Naad for his Vedas.<br>
  The Gurmukh's cleansing bath is the performance of good deeds.<br>
  For the Gurmukh, the Shabad is the most excellent Ambrosial Nectar.<br>
  O Nanak, the Gurmukh crosses over. ||22||<br>
  The fickle consciousness does not remain stable.<br>
  The deer secretly nibbles at the green sprouts.<br>
  One who enshrines the Lord's lotus feet in his heart and consciousness<br>
  lives long, always remembering the Lord.<br>
  Everyone has worries and cares.<br>
  He alone finds peace, who thinks of the One Lord.<br>
  When the Lord dwells in the consciousness, and one is absorbed in the Lord's Name,<br>
  one is liberated, and returns home with honor. ||23||<br>
  The body falls apart, when one knot is untied.<br>
  Behold, the world is on the decline; it will be totally destroyed.<br>
  Only one who looks alike upon sunshine and shade<br>
  has his bonds shattered; he is liberated and returns home.<br>
  Maya is empty and petty; she has defrauded the world.<br>
  Such destiny is pre-ordained by past actions.<br>
  Youth is wasting away; old age and death hover above the head.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 058</h2></center>
  The body falls apart, like algae upon the water. ||24||<br>
  God Himself appears throughout the three worlds.<br>
  Throughout the ages, He is the Great Giver; there is no other at all.<br>
  As it pleases You, You protect and preserve us.<br>
  I ask for the Lord's Praises, which bless me with honor and credit.<br>
  Remaining awake and aware, I am pleasing to You, O Lord.<br>
  When You unite me with Yourself, then I am merged in You.<br>
  I chant Your Victorious Praises, O Life of the World.<br>
  Accepting the Guru's Teachings, one is sure to merge in the One Lord. ||25||<br>
  Why do you speak such nonsense, and argue with the world?<br>
  You shall die repenting, when you see your own insanity.<br>
  He is born, only to die, but he does not wish to live.<br>
  He comes hopeful, and then goes, without hope.<br>
  Regretting, repenting and grieving, he is dust mixing with dust.<br>
  Death does not chew up one who sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord.<br>
  The nine treasures are obtained through the Name of the Lord;<br>
  the Lord bestows intuitive peace and poise. ||26||<br>
  He speaks spiritual wisdom, and He Himself understands it.<br>
  He Himself knows it, and He Himself comprehends it.<br>
  One who takes the Words of the Guru into his very fiber,<br>
  is immaculate and holy, and is pleasing to the True Lord.<br>
  In the ocean of the Guru, there is no shortage of pearls.<br>
  The treasure of jewels is truly inexhaustible.<br>
  Do those deeds which the Guru has ordained.<br>
  Why are you chasing after the Guru's actions?<br>
  O Nanak, through the Guru's Teachings, merge in the True Lord. ||27||<br>
  Love is broken, when one speaks in defiance.<br>
  The arm is broken, when it is pulled from both sides.<br>
  Love breaks, when the speech goes sour.<br>
  The Husband Lord abandons and leaves behind the evil-minded bride.<br>
  The broken knot is tied again, through contemplation and meditation.<br>
  Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, one's affairs are resolved in one's own home.<br>
  One who earns the profit of the True Name, will not lose it again;<br>
  the Lord and Master of the three worlds is your best friend. ||28||<br>
  Control your mind, and keep it in its place.<br>
  The world is destroyed by conflict, regretting its sinful mistakes.<br>
  There is one Husband Lord, and all are His brides.<br>
  The false bride wears many costumes.<br>
  He stops her from going into the homes of others;<br>
  He summons her to the Mansion of His Presence, and no obstacles block her path.<br>
  She is embellished with the Word of the Shabad, and is loved by the True Lord.<br>
  She is the happy soul bride, who takes the Support of her Lord and Master. ||29||<br>
  Wandering and roaming around, O my companion, your beautiful robes are torn.<br>
  In jealousy, the body is not at peace; without the Fear of God, multitudes are ruined.<br>
  One who remains dead within her own home, through the Fear of God, is looked upon with favor by her all-knowing Husband Lord.<br>
  She maintains fear of her Guru, and chants the Name of the Fearless Lord.<br>
  Living on the mountain, I suffer such great thirst; when I see Him, I know that He is not far away.<br>
  My thirst is quenched, and I have accepted the Word of the Shabad. I drink my fill of the Ambrosial Nectar.<br>
  Everyone says, "Give! Give!" As He pleases, He gives.<br>
  Through the Gurdwara, the Guru's Door, He gives, and quenches the thirst. ||30||<br>
  Searching and seeking, I fell down and collapsed upon the bank of the river of life.<br>
  Those who are heavy with sin sink down, but those who are light swim across.<br>
  I am a sacrifice to those who meet the immortal and immeasurable Lord.<br>
  The dust of their feet brings emancipation; in their company, we are united in the Lord's Union.<br>
  I gave my mind to my Guru, and received the Immaculate Name.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 059</h2></center>
  I serve the One who gave me the Naam; I am a sacrifice to Him.<br>
  He who builds, also demolishes; there is no other than Him.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, I contemplate Him, and then my body does not suffer in pain. ||31||<br>
  No one is mine - whose gown should I grasp and hold? No one ever was, and no one shall ever be mine.<br>
  Coming and going, one is ruined, afflicted with the disease of dual-mindedness.<br>
  Those beings who lack the Naam, the Name of the Lord, collapse like pillars of salt.<br>
  Without the Name, how can they find release? They fall into hell in the end.<br>
  Using a limited number of words, we describe the unlimited True Lord.<br>
  The ignorant lack understanding. Without the Guru, there is no spiritual wisdom.<br>
  The separated soul is like the broken string of a guitar, which does not vibrate its sound.<br>
  God unites the separated souls with Himself, awakening their destiny. ||32||<br>
  The body is the tree, and the mind is the bird; the birds in the tree are the five senses.<br>
  They peck at the essence of reality, and merge with the One Lord. They are never trapped at all.<br>
  But the others fly away in a hurry, when they see the food.<br>
  Their feathers are clipped, and they are caught in the noose; through their mistakes, they are caught in disaster.<br>
  Without the True Lord, how can anyone find release? The jewel of the Lord's Glorious Praises comes by the karma of good actions.<br>
  When He Himself releases them, only then are they released. He Himself is the Great Master.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, they are released, when He Himself grants His Grace.<br>
  Glorious greatness rests in His Hands. He blesses those with whom He is pleased. ||33||<br>
  The soul trembles and shakes, when it loses its mooring and support.<br>
  Only the support of the True Lord brings honor and glory. Through it, one's works are never in vain.<br>
  The Lord is eternal and forever stable; the Guru is stable, and contemplation upon the True Lord is stable.<br>
  O Lord and Master of angels, men and Yogic masters, You are the support of the unsupported.<br>
  In all places and interspaces, You are the Giver, the Great Giver.<br>
  Wherever I look, there I see You, Lord; You have no end or limitation.<br>
  You are pervading and permeating the places and interspaces; reflecting upon the Word of the Guru's Shabad, You are found.<br>
  You give gifts even when they are not asked for; You are great, inaccessible and infinite. ||34||<br>
  O Merciful Lord, You are the embodiment of mercy; creating the Creation, You behold it.<br>
  Please shower Your Mercy upon me, O God, and unite me with Yourself. In an instant, You destroy and rebuild.<br>
  You are all-wise and all-seeing; You are the Greatest Giver of all givers.<br>
  He is the Eradicator of poverty, and the Destroyer of pain; the Gurmukh realizes spiritual wisdom and meditation. ||35||<br>
  Losing his wealth, he cries out in anguish; the fool's consciousness is engrossed in wealth.<br>
  How rare are those who gather the wealth of Truth, and love the Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord.<br>
  If by losing your wealth, you may become absorbed in the Love of the One Lord, then just let it go.<br>
  Dedicate your mind, and surrender your head; seek only the Support of the Creator Lord.<br>
  Worldly affairs and wanderings cease, when the mind is filled with the bliss of the Shabad.<br>
  Even one's enemies become friends, meeting with the Guru, the Lord of the Universe.<br>
  Wandering from forest to forest searching, you will find that those things are within the home of your own heart.<br>
  United by the True Guru, you shall remain united, and the pains of birth and death will be ended. ||36||<br>
  Through various rituals, one does not find release. Without virtue, one is sent to the City of Death.<br>
  One will not have this world or the next; committing sinful mistakes, one comes to regret and repent in the end.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 060</h2></center>
  He has neither spiritual wisdom or meditation; neither Dharmic faith mor meditation.<br>
  Without the Name, how can one be fearless? How can he understand egotistical pride?<br>
  I am so tired - how can I get there? This ocean has no bottom or end.<br>
  I have no loving companions, whom I can ask for help.<br>
  O Nanak, crying out, "Beloved, Beloved", we are united with the Uniter.<br>
  He who separated me, unites me again; my love for the Guru is infinite. ||37||<br>
  Sin is bad, but it is dear to the sinner.<br>
  He loads himself with sin, and expands his world through sin.<br>
  Sin is far away from one who understands himself.<br>
  He is not afflicted by sorrow or separation.<br>
  How can one avoid falling into hell? How can he cheat the Messenger of Death?<br>
  How can coming and going be forgotten? Falsehood is bad, and death is cruel.<br>
  The mind is enveloped by entanglements, and into entanglements it falls.<br>
  Without the Name, how can anyone be saved? They rot away in sin. ||38||<br>
  Again and again, the crow falls into the trap.<br>
  Then he regrets it, but what can he do now?<br>
  Even though he is trapped, he pecks at the food; he does not understand.<br>
  If he meets the True Guru, then he sees with his eyes.<br>
  Like a fish, he is caught in the noose of death.<br>
  Do not seek liberation from anyone else, except the Guru, the Great Giver.<br>
  Over and over again, he comes; over and over again, he goes.<br>
  Be absorbed in love for the One Lord, and remain lovingly focused on Him.<br>
  In this way you shall be saved, and you shall not fall into the trap again. ||39||<br>
  She calls out, "Brother, O brother - stay, O brother!" But he becomes a stranger.<br>
  Her brother departs for his own home, and his sister burns with the pain of separation.<br>
  In this world, her father's home, the daughter, the innocent soul bride, loves her Young Husband Lord.<br>
  If you long for your Husband Lord, O soul bride, then serve the True Guru with love.<br>
  How rare are the spiritually wise, who meet the True Guru, and truly understand.<br>
  All glorious greatness rests in the Lord and Master's Hands. He grants them, when He is pleased.<br>
  How rare are those who contemplate the Word of the Guru's Bani; they become Gurmukh.<br>
  This is the Bani of the Supreme Being; through it, one dwells within the home of his inner being. ||40||<br>
  Shattering and breaking apart, He creates and re-creates; creating, He shatters again. He builds up what He has demolished, and demolishes what He has built.<br>
  He dries up the pools which are full, and fills the dried tanks again. He is all-powerful and independent.<br>
  Deluded by doubt, they have gone insane; without destiny, what do they obtain?<br>
  The Gurmukhs know that God holds the string; wherever He pulls it, they must go.<br>
  Those who sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, are forever imbued with His Love; they never again feel regret.<br>
  Bhabha: If someone seeks, and then becomes Gurmukh, then he comes to dwell in the home of his own heart.<br>
  Bhabha: The way of the terrifying world-ocean is treacherous. Remain free of hope, in the midst of hope, and you shall cross over.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, one comes to understand himself; in this way, he remains dead while yet alive. ||41||<br>
  Crying out for the wealth and riches of Maya, they die; but Maya does not go along with them.<br>
  The soul-swan arises and departs, sad and depressed, leaving its wealth behind.<br>
  The false mind is hunted by the Messenger of Death; it carries its faults along when it goes.<br>
  The mind turns inward, and merges with mind, when it is with virtue.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 061</h2></center>
  Crying out, "Mine, mine!", they have died, but without the Name, they find only pain.<br>
  So where are their forts, mansions, palaces and courts? They are like a short story.<br>
  O Nanak, without the True Name, the false just come and go.<br>
  He Himself is clever and so very beautiful; He Himself is wise and all-knowing. ||42||<br>
  Those who come, must go in the end; they come and go, regretting and repenting.<br>
  They will pass through 8.4 millions species; this number does not decrease or rise.<br>
  They alone are saved, who love the Lord.<br>
  Their worldly entanglements are ended, and Maya is conquered.<br>
  Whoever is seen, shall depart; who should I make my friend?<br>
  I dedicate my soul, and place my body and mind in offering before Him.<br>
  You are eternally stable, O Creator, Lord and Master; I lean on Your Support.<br>
  Conquered by virtue, egotism is killed; imbued with the Word of the Shabad, the mind rejects the world. ||43||<br>
  Neither the kings nor the nobles will remain; neither the rich nor the poor will remain.<br>
  When one's turn comes, no one can stay here.<br>
  The path is difficult and treacherous; the pools and mountains are impassable.<br>
  My body is filled with faults; I am dying of grief. Without virtue, how can I enter my home?<br>
  The virtuous take virtue, and meet God; how can I meet them with love?<br>
  If ony I could be like them, chanting and meditating within my heart on the Lord.<br>
  He is overflowing with faults and demerits, but virtue dwells within him as well.<br>
  Without the True Guru, he does not see God's Virtues; he does not chant the Glorious Virtues of God. ||44||<br>
  God's soldiers take care of their homes; their pay is pre-ordained, before they come into the world.<br>
  They serve their Supreme Lord and Master, and obtain the profit.<br>
  They renounce greed, avarice and evil, and forget them from their minds.<br>
  In the fortress of the body, they announce the victory of their Supreme King; they are never ever vanquished.<br>
  One who calls himself a servant of his Lord and Master, and yet speaks defiantly to Him,<br>
  shall forfeit his pay, and not be seated upon the throne.<br>
  Glorious greatness rests in the hands of my Beloved; He gives, according to the Pleasure of His Will.<br>
  He Himself does everything; who else should we address? No one else does anything. ||45||<br>
  I cannot conceive of any other, who could be seated upon the royal cushions.<br>
  The Supreme Man of men eradicates hell; He is True, and True is His Name.<br>
  I wandered around searching for Him in the forests and meadows; I contemplate Him within my mind.<br>
  The treasures of myriads of pearls, jewels and emeralds are in the hands of the True Guru.<br>
  Meeting with God, I am exalted and elevated; I love the One Lord single-mindedly.<br>
  O Nanak, one who lovingly meets with his Beloved, earns profit in the world hereafter.<br>
  He who created and formed the creation, made your form as well.<br>
  As Gurmukh, meditate on the Infinite Lord, who has no end or limitation. ||46||<br>
  Rharha: The Dear Lord is beautiful;<br>
  There is no other king, except Him.<br>
  Rharha: Listen to the spell, and the Lord will come to dwell in your mind.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, one finds the Lord; do not be deluded by doubt.<br>
  He alone is the true banker, who has the capital of the wealth of the Lord.<br>
  The Gurmukh is perfect - applaud him!<br>
  Through the beautiful Word of the Guru's Bani, the Lord is obtained; contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 062</h2></center>
  Self-conceit is eliminated, and pain is eradicated; the soul bride obtains her Husband Lord. ||47||<br>
  He hoards gold and silver, but this wealth is false and poisonous, nothing more than ashes.<br>
  He calls himself a banker, gathering wealth, but he is ruined by his dual-mindedness.<br>
  The truthful ones gather Truth; the True Name is priceless.<br>
  The Lord is immaculate and pure; through Him, their honor is true, and their speech is true.<br>
  You are my friend and companion, all-knowing Lord; You are the lake, and You are the swan.<br>
  I am a sacrifice to that being, whose mind is filled with the True Lord and Master.<br>
  Know the One who created love and attachment to Maya, the Enticer.<br>
  One who realizes the all-knowing Primal Lord, looks alike upon poison and nectar. ||48||<br>
  Without patience and forgiveness, countless hundreds of thousands have perished.<br>
  Their numbers cannot be counted; how could I count them? Bothered and bewildered, uncounted numbers have died.<br>
  One who realizes his Lord and Master is set free, and not bound by chains.<br>
  Through the Word of the Shabad, enter the Mansion of the Lord's Presence; you shall be blessed with patience, forgiveness, truth and peace.<br>
  Partake of the true wealth of meditation, and the Lord Himself shall abide within your body.<br>
  With mind, body and mouth, chant His Glorious Virtues forever; courage and composure shall enter deep within your mind.<br>
  Through egotism, one is distracted and ruined; other than the Lord, all things are corrupt.<br>
  Forming His creatures, He placed Himself within them; the Creator is unattached and infinite. ||49||<br>
  No one knows the mystery of the Creator of the World.<br>
  Whatever the Creator of the World does, is certain to occur.<br>
  For wealth, some meditate on the Lord.<br>
  By pre-ordained destiny, wealth is obtained.<br>
  For the sake of wealth, some become servants or thieves.<br>
  Wealth does not go along with them when they die; it passes into the hands of others.<br>
  Without Truth, honor is not obtained in the Court of the Lord.<br>
  Drinking in the subtle essence of the Lord, one is emancipated in the end. ||50||<br>
  Seeing and perceiving, O my companions, I am wonder-struck and amazed.<br>
  My egotism, which proclaimed itself in possessiveness and self-conceit, is dead. My mind chants the Word of the Shabad, and attains spiritual wisdom.<br>
  I am so tired of wearing all these necklaces, hair-ties and bracelets, and decorating myself.<br>
  Meeting with my Beloved, I have found peace; now, I wear the necklace of total virtue.<br>
  O Nanak, the Gurmukh attains the Lord, with love and affection.<br>
  Without the Lord, who has found peace? Reflect upon this in your mind, and see.<br>
  Read about the Lord, understand the Lord, and enshrine love for the Lord.<br>
  Chant the Lord's Name, and meditate on the Lord; hold tight to the Support of the Name of the Lord. ||51||<br>
  The inscription inscribed by the Creator Lord cannot be erased, O my companions.<br>
  He who created the universe, in His Mercy, installs His Feet within us.<br>
  Glorious greatness rests in the Hands of the Creator; reflect upon the Guru, and understand this.<br>
  This inscription cannot be challenged. As it pleases You, You care for me.<br>
  By Your Glance of Grace, I have found peace; O Nanak, reflect upon the Shabad.<br>
  The self-willed manmukhs are confused; they rot away and die. Only by reflecting upon the Guru can they be saved.<br>
  What can anyone say, about that Primal Lord, who cannot be seen?<br>
  I am a sacrifice to my Guru, who has revealed Him to me, within my own heart. ||52||<br>
  That Pandit, that religious scholar, is said to be well-educated, if he contemplates knowledge with intuitive ease.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 063</h2></center>
  Considering his knowledge, he finds the essence of reality, and lovingly focuses his attention on the Name of the Lord.<br>
  The self-willed manmukh sells his knowledge; he earns poison, and eats poison.<br>
  The fool does not think of the Word of the Shabad. He has no understanding, no comprehension. ||53||<br>
  That Pandit is called Gurmukh, who imparts understanding to his students.<br>
  Contemplate the Naam, the Name of the Lord; gather in the Naam, and earn the true profit in this world.<br>
  With the true notebook of the true mind, study the most sublime Word of the Shabad.<br>
  O Nanak, he alone is learned, and he alone is a wise Pandit, who wears the necklace of the Lord's Name. ||54||1||<br>
  Raamkalee, First Mehl, Sidh Gosht ~ Conversations With The Siddhas:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  The Siddhas formed an assembly; sitting in their Yogic postures, they shouted, "Salute this gathering of Saints."<br>
  I offer my salutation to the One who is true, infinite and incomparably beautiful.<br>
  I cut off my head, and offer it to Him; I dedicate my body and mind to Him.<br>
  O Nanak, meeting with the Saints, Truth is obtained, and one is spontaneously blessed with distinction. ||1||<br>
  What is the use of wandering around? Purity comes only through Truth.<br>
  Without the True Word of the Shabad, no one finds liberation. ||1||Pause||<br>
  "Who are you? What is your name? What is your way? What is your goal?<br>
  We pray that you will answer us truthfully; we are a sacrifice to the humble Saints.<br>
  Where is your seat? Where do you live, boy? Where did you come from, and where are you going?<br>
  Tell us, Nanak - the detached Siddhas wait to hear your reply. What is your path?"||2||<br>
  He dwells deep within the nucleus of each and every heart. This is my seat and my home. I walk in harmony with the Will of the True Guru.<br>
  I came from the Celestial Lord God; I go wherever He orders me to go. I am Nanak, forever under the Command of His Will.<br>
  I sit in the posture of the eternal, imperishable Lord. These are the Teachings I have received from the Guru.<br>
  As Gurmukh, I have come to understand and realize myself; I merge in the Truest of the True. ||3||<br>
  "The world-ocean is treacherous and impassable; how can one cross over?<br>
  Charpat the Yogi says, O Nanak, think it over, and give us your true reply."<br>
  What answer can I give to someone, who claims to understand himself?<br>
  I speak the Truth; if you have already crossed over, how can I argue with you? ||4||<br>
  The lotus flower floats untouched upon the surface of the water, and the duck swims through the stream;<br>
  with one's consciousness focused on the Word of the Shabad, one crosses over the terrifying world-ocean. O Nanak, chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<br>
  One who lives alone, as a hermit, enshrining the One Lord in his mind, remaining unaffected by hope in the midst of hope,<br>
  sees and inspires others to see the inaccessible, unfathomable Lord. Nanak is his slave. ||5||<br>
  "Listen, Lord, to our prayer. We seek your true opinion.<br>
  Don't be angry with us - please tell us: How can we find the Guru's Door?"<br>
  This fickle mind sits in its true home, O Nanak, through the Support of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<br>
  The Creator Himself unites us in Union, and inspires us to love the Truth. ||6||<br>
  "Away from stores and highways, we live in the woods, among plants and trees.<br>
  For food, we take fruits and roots. This is the spiritual wisdom spoken by the renunciates.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 064</h2></center>
  We bathe at sacred shrines of pilgrimage, and obtain the fruits of peace; not even an iota of filth sticks to us.<br>
  Luhaareepaa, the disciple of Gorakh says, this is the Way of Yoga."||7||<br>
  In the stores and on the road, do not sleep; do not let your consciousness covet anyone else's home.<br>
  Without the Name, the mind has no firm support; O Nanak, this hunger never departs.<br>
  The Guru has revealed the stores and the city within the home of my own heart, where I intuitively carry on the true trade.<br>
  Sleep little, and eat little; O Nanak, this is the essence of wisdom. ||8||<br>
  "Wear the robes of the sect of Yogis who follow Gorakh; put on the ear-rings, begging wallet and patched coat.<br>
  Among the twelve schools of Yoga, ours is the highest; among the six schools of philosophy, ours is the best path.<br>
  This is the way to instruct the mind, so you will never suffer beatings again."<br>
  Nanak speaks: the Gurmukh understands; this is the way that Yoga is attained. ||9||<br>
  Let constant absorption in the Word of the Shabad deep within be your ear-rings; eradicate egotism and attachment.<br>
  Discard sexual desire, anger and egotism, and through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, attain true understanding.<br>
  For your patched coat and begging bowl, see the Lord God pervading and permeating everywhere; O Nanak, the One Lord will carry you across.<br>
  True is our Lord and Master, and True is His Name. Analyze it, and you shall find the Word of the Guru to be True. ||10||<br>
  Let your mind turn away in detachment from the world, and let this be your begging bowl. Let the lessons of the five elements be your cap.<br>
  Let the body be your meditation mat, and the mind your loin cloth.<br>
  Let truth, contentment and self-discipline be your companions.<br>
  O Nanak, the Gurmukh dwells on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||11||<br>
  "Who is hidden? Who is liberated?<br>
  Who is united, inwardly and outwardly?<br>
  Who comes, and who goes?<br>
  Who is permeating and pervading the three worlds?"||12||<br>
  He is hidden within each and every heart. The Gurmukh is liberated.<br>
  Through the Word of the Shabad, one is united, inwardly and outwardly.<br>
  The self-willed manmukh perishes, and comes and goes.<br>
  O Nanak, the Gurmukh merges in Truth. ||13||<br>
  "How is one placed in bondage, and consumed by the serpent of Maya?<br>
  How does one lose, and how does one gain?<br>
  How does one become immaculate and pure? How is the darkness of ignorance removed?<br>
  One who understands this essence of reality is our Guru."||14||<br>
  Man is bound by evil-mindedness, and consumed by Maya, the serpent.<br>
  The self-willed manmukh loses, and the Gurmukh gains.<br>
  Meeting the True Guru, darkness is dispelled.<br>
  O Nanak, eradicating egotism, one merges in the Lord. ||15||<br>
  Focused deep within, in perfect absorption,<br>
  the soul-swan does not fly away, and the body-wall does not collapse.<br>
  Then, one knows that his true home is in the cave of intuitive poise.<br>
  O Nanak, the True Lord loves those who are truthful. ||16||<br>
  "Why have you left your house and become a wandering Udaasee?<br>
  Why have you adopted these religious robes?<br>
  What merchandise do you trade?<br>
  How will you carry others across with you?"||17||<br>
  I became a wandering Udaasee, searching for the Gurmukhs.<br>
  I have adopted these robes seeking the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan.<br>
  I trade in the merchandise of Truth.<br>
  O Nanak, as Gurmukh, I carry others across. ||18||<br>
  "How have you changed the course of your life?<br>
  With what have you linked your mind?<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 065</h2></center>
  How have you subdued your hopes and desires?<br>
  How have you found the Light deep within your nucleus?<br>
  Without teeth, how can you eat iron?<br>
  Give us your true opinion, Nanak."||19||<br>
  Born into the House of the True Guru, my wandering in reincarnation ended.<br>
  My mind is attached and attuned to the unstruck sound current.<br>
  Through the Word of the Shabad, my hopes and desires have been burnt away.<br>
  As Gurmukh, I found the Light deep within the nucleus of my self.<br>
  Eradicating the three qualities, one eats iron.<br>
  O Nanak, the Emancipator emancipates. ||20||<br>
  "What can you tell us about the beginning? In what home did the absolute dwell then?<br>
  What are the ear-rings of spiritual wisdom? Who dwells in each and every heart?<br>
  How can one avoid the attack of death? How can one enter the home of fearlessness?<br>
  How can one know the posture of intuition and contentment, and overcome one's adversaries?"<br>
  Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, egotism and corruption are conquered, and then one comes to dwell in the home of the self within.<br>
  One who realizes the Shabad of the One who created the creation - Nanak is his slave. ||21||<br>
  "Where did we come from? Where are we going? Where will we be absorbed?<br>
  One who reveals the meaning of this Shabad is the Guru, who has no greed at all.<br>
  How can one find the essence of the unmanifest reality? How does one become Gurmukh, and enshrine love for the Lord?<br>
  He Himself is consciousness, He Himself is the Creator; share with us, Nanak, your wisdom."<br>
  By His Command we come, and by His Command we go; by His Command, we merge in absorption.<br>
  Through the Perfect Guru, live the Truth; through the Word of the Shabad, the state of dignity is attained. ||22||<br>
  We can only express a sense of wonder about the beginning. The absolute abided endlessly deep within Himself then.<br>
  Consider freedom from desire to be the ear-rings of the Guru's spiritual wisdom. The True Lord, the Soul of all, dwells within each and every heart.<br>
  Through the Guru's Word, one merges in the absolute, and intuitively receives the immaculate essence.<br>
  O Nanak, that Sikh who seeks and finds the Way does not serve any other.<br>
  Wonderful and amazing is His Command; He alone realizes His Command and knows the true way of life of His creatures.<br>
  One who eradicates his self-conceit becomes free of desire; he alone is a Yogi, who enshrines the True Lord deep within. ||23||<br>
  From His state of absolute existence, He assumed the immaculate form; from formless, He assumed the supreme form.<br>
  By pleasing the True Guru, the supreme status is obtained, and one is absorbed in the True Word of the Shabad.<br>
  He knows the True Lord as the One and only; he sends his egotism and duality far away.<br>
  He alone is a Yogi, who realizes the Word of the Guru's Shabad; the lotus of the heart blossoms forth within.<br>
  If one remains dead while yet alive, then he understands everything; he knows the Lord deep within himself, who is kind and compassionate to all.<br>
  O Nanak, he is blessed with glorious greatness; he realizes himself in all beings. ||24||<br>
  We emerge from Truth, and merge into Truth again. The pure being merges into the One True Lord.<br>
  The false come, and find no place of rest; in duality, they come and go.<br>
  This coming and going in reincarnation is ended through the Word of the Guru's Shabad; the Lord Himself analyzes and grants His forgiveness.<br>
  One who suffers from the disease of duality, forgets the Naam, the source of nectar.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 066</h2></center>
  He alone understands, whom the Lord inspires to understand. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, one is liberated.<br>
  O Nanak, the Emancipator emancipates one who drives out egotism and duality. ||25||<br>
  The self-willed manmukhs are deluded, under the shadow of death.<br>
  They look into the homes of others, and lose.<br>
  The manmukhs are confused by doubt, wandering in the wilderness.<br>
  Having lost their way, they are plundered; they chant their mantras at cremation grounds.<br>
  They do not think of the Shabad; instead, they utter obscenities.<br>
  O Nanak, those who are attuned to the Truth know peace. ||26||<br>
  The Gurmukh lives in the Fear of God, the True Lord.<br>
  Through the Word of the Guru's Bani, the Gurmukh refines the unrefined.<br>

  The Gurmukh speaks the unspoken wisdom.<br>
  In the midst of his family, the Gurmukh lives a spiritual life.<br>
  The Gurmukh lovingly meditates deep within.<br>
  The Gurmukh obtains the Shabad, and righteous conduct.<br>
  He knows the mystery of the Shabad, and inspires others to know it.<br>
  O Nanak, burning away his ego, he merges in the Lord. ||29||<br>
  The True Lord fashioned the earth for the sake of the Gurmukhs.<br>
  There, he set in motion the play of creation and destruction.<br>
  One who is filled with the Word of the Guru's Shabad enshrines love for the Lord.<br>
  Attuned to the Truth, he goes to his home with honor.<br>
  Without the True Word of the Shabad, no one receives honor.<br>
  O Nanak, without the Name, how can one be absorbed in Truth? ||30||<br>
  The Gurmukh obtains the eight miraculous spiritual powers, and all wisdom.<br>
  The Gurmukh crosses over the terrifying world-ocean, and obtains true understanding.<br>
  The Gurmukh knows the ways of truth and untruth.<br>
  The Gurmukh knows worldliness and renunciation.<br>
  The Gurmukh crosses over, and carries others across as well.<br>

  Attuned to the Naam, they remain absorbed in the True Lord.<br>
  Attuned to the Naam, they contemplate the Way of Yoga.<br>
  Attuned to the Naam, they find the door of liberation.<br>

  Attuned to the Naam, they practice intense meditation forever.<br>
  Attuned to the Naam, they live the true and excellent lifestyle.<br>
  Attuned to the Naam, they contemplate the Lord's virtues and spiritual wisdom.<br>
  Without the Name, all that is spoken is useless.<br>
  O Nanak, attuned to the Naam, their victory is celebrated. ||33||<br>
  Through the Perfect Guru, one obtains the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<br>
  The Way of Yoga is to remain absorbed in Truth.<br>
  The Yogis wander in the twelve schools of Yoga; the Sannyaasis in six and four.<br>
  One who remains dead while yet alive, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, finds the door of liberation.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 067</h2></center>
  Without the Shabad, all are attached to duality. Contemplate this in your heart, and see.<br>
  O Nanak, blessed and very fortunate are those who keep the True Lord enshrined in their hearts. ||34||<br>
  The Gurmukh obtains the jewel, lovingly focused on the Lord.<br>
  The Gurmukh intuitively recognizes the value of this jewel.<br>

  The Gurmukh eliminates hate and envy.<br>
  The Gurmukh erases all accounting.<br>
  The Gurmukh is imbued with love for the Lord's Name.<br>
  O Nanak, the Gurmukh realizes his Lord and Master. ||37||<br>
  Without the Guru, one wanders, coming and going in reincarnation.<br>
  Without the Guru, one's work is useless.<br>
  Without the Guru, the mind is totally unsteady.<br>
  Without the Guru, one is unsatisfied, and eats poison.<br>
  Without the Guru, one is stung by the poisonous snake of Maya, and dies.<br>
  O Nanak without the Guru, all is lost. ||38||<br>
  One who meets the Guru is carried across.<br>
  His sins are erased, and he is emancipated through virtue.<br>
  The supreme peace of liberation is attained, contemplating the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<br>
  The Gurmukh is never defeated.<br>
  In the store of the body, this mind is the merchant;<br>
  O Nanak, it deals intuitively in Truth. ||39||<br>
  The Gurmukh is the bridge, built by the Architect of Destiny.<br>
  The demons of passion which plundered Sri Lanka - the body - have been conquered.<br>
  Ram Chand - the mind - has slaughtered Raawan - pride;<br>
  the Gurmukh understands the secret revealed by Babheekhan.<br>
  The Gurmukh carries even stones across the ocean.<br>
  The Gurmukh saves millions of people. ||40||<br>

  The Gurmukh is honored in the Court of the Lord.<br>
  The Gurmukh distinguishes the true from the false.<br>
  The Gurmukh focuses his meditation on the celestial Lord.<br>
  In the Court of the Lord, the Gurmukh is absorbed in His Praises.<br>

  The Gurmukh obtains the Name of the Immaculate Lord.<br>
  Through the Shabad, the Gurmukh burns away his ego.<br>
  The Gurmukh sings the Glorious Praises of the True Lord.<br>
  The Gurmukh remains absorbed in the True Lord.<br>
  Through the True Name, the Gurmukh is honored and exalted.<br>
  O Nanak, the Gurmukh understands all the worlds. ||42||<br>
  "What is the root, the source of all? What teachings hold for these times?<br>
  Who is your guru? Whose disciple are you?<br>
  What is that speech, by which you remain unattached?<br>
  Listen to what we say, O Nanak, you little boy.<br>
  Give us your opinion on what we have said.<br>
  How can the Shabad carry us across the terrifying world-ocean?"||43||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 068</h2></center>
  From the air came the beginning. This is the age of the True Guru's Teachings.<br>
  The Shabad is the Guru, upon whom I lovingly focus my consciousness; I am the chaylaa, the disciple.<br>
  Speaking the Unspoken Speech, I remain unattached.<br>
  O Nanak, throughout the ages, the Lord of the World is my Guru.<br>
  I contemplate the sermon of the Shabad, the Word of the One God.<br>
  The Gurmukh puts out the fire of egotism. ||44||<br>
  "With teeth of wax, how can one chew iron?<br>
  What is that food, which takes away pride?<br>
  How can one live in the palace, the home of snow, wearing robes of fire?<br>
  Where is that cave, within which one may remain unshaken?<br>
  Who should we know to be pervading here and there?<br>
  What is that meditation, which leads the mind to be absorbed in itself?"||45||<br>
  Eradicating egotism and individualism from within,<br>
  and erasing duality, the mortal becomes one with God.<br>
  The world is difficult for the foolish, self-willed manmukh;<br>
  practicing the Shabad, one chews iron.<br>
  Know the One Lord, inside and out.<br>
  O Nanak, the fire is quenched, through the Pleasure of the True Guru's Will. ||46||<br>
  Imbued with the True Fear of God, pride is taken away;<br>
  realize that He is One, and contemplate the Shabad.<br>
  With the True Shabad abiding deep within the heart,<br>
  the body and mind are cooled and soothed, and colored with the Lord's Love.<br>
  The fire of sexual desire, anger and corruption is quenched.<br>
  O Nanak, the Beloved bestows His Glance of Grace. ||47||<br>
  "The moon of the mind is cool and dark; how is it enlightened?<br>
  How does the sun blaze so brilliantly?<br>
  How can the constant watchful gaze of Death be turned away?<br>
  By what understanding is the honor of the Gurmukh preserved?<br>
  Who is the warrior, who conquers Death?<br>
  Give us your thoughtful reply, O Nanak."||48||<br>
  Giving voice to the Shabad, the moon of the mind is illuminated with infinity.<br>
  When the sun dwells in the house of the moon, the darkness is dispelled.<br>
  Pleasure and pain are just the same, when one takes the Support of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<br>
  He Himself saves, and carries us across.<br>
  With faith in the Guru, the mind merges in Truth,<br>
  and then, prays Nanak, one is not consumed by Death. ||49||<br>
  The essence of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is known to be the most exalted and excellent of all.<br>
  Without the Name, one is afflicted by pain and death.<br>
  When one's essence merges into the essence, the mind is satisfied and fulfilled.<br>
  Duality is gone, and one enters into the home of the One Lord.<br>
  The breath blows across the sky of the Tenth Gate and vibrates.<br>
  O Nanak, the mortal then intuitively meets the eternal, unchanging Lord. ||50||<br>
  The absolute Lord is deep within; the absolute Lord is outside us as well. The absolute Lord totally fills the three worlds.<br>
  One who knows the Lord in the fourth state, is not subject to virtue or vice.<br>
  One who knows the mystery of God the Absolute, who pervades each and every heart, knows the Primal Being, the Immaculate Divine Lord.<br>
  That humble being who is imbued with the Immaculate Naam,<br>
  O Nanak, is himself the Primal Lord, the Architect of Destiny. ||51||<br>
  "Everyone speaks of the Absolute Lord, the unmanifest void.<br>
  How can one find this absolute void?<br>
  Who are they, who are attuned to this absolute void?"<br>
  They are like the Lord, from whom they originated.<br>
  They are not born, they do not die; they do not come and go.<br>
  O Nanak, the Gurmukhs instruct their minds. ||52||<br>
  By practicing control over the nine gates, one attains perfect control over the Tenth Gate.<br>
  There, the unstruck sound current of the absolute Lord vibrates and resounds.<br>
  Behold the True Lord ever-present, and merge with Him.<br>
  The True Lord is pervading and permeating each and every heart.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 069</h2></center>
  The hidden Bani of the Word is revealed.<br>
  O Nanak, the True Lord is revealed and known. ||53||<br>
  Meeting with the Lord through intuition and love, peace is found.<br>
  The Gurmukh remains awake and aware; he does not fall sleep.<br>
  He enshrines the unlimited, absolute Shabad deep within.<br>
  Chanting the Shabad, he is liberated, and saves others as well.<br>
  Those who practice the Guru's Teachings are attuned to the Truth.<br>
  O Nanak, those who eradicate their self-conceit meet with the Lord; they do not remain separated by doubt. ||54||<br>
  "Where is that place, where evil thoughts are destroyed?<br>
  The mortal does not understand the essence of reality; why must he suffer in pain?"<br>
  No one can save one who is tied up at Death's door.<br>
  Without the Shabad, no one has any credit or honor.<br>
  "How can one obtain understanding and cross over?"<br>
  O Nanak, the foolish self-willed manmukh does not understand. ||55||<br>
  Evil thoughts are erased, contemplating the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<br>
  Meeting with the True Guru, the door of liberation is found.<br>
  The self-willed manmukh does not understand the essence of reality, and is burnt to ashes.<br>
  His evil-mindedness separates him from the Lord, and he suffers.<br>
  Accepting the Hukam of the Lord's Command, he is blessed with all virtues and spiritual wisdom.<br>
  O Nanak, he is honored in the Court of the Lord. ||56||<br>
  One who possesses the merchandise, the wealth of the True Name,<br>
  crosses over, and carries others across with him as well.<br>
  One who intuitively understands, and is attuned to the Lord, is honored.<br>
  No one can estimate his worth.<br>
  Wherever I look, I see the Lord permeating and pervading.<br>
  O Nanak, through the Love of the True Lord, one crosses over. ||57||<br>
  "Where is the Shabad said to dwell? What will carry us across the terrifying world-ocean?<br>
  The breath, when exhaled, extends out ten finger lengths; what is the support of the breath?<br>
  Speaking and playing, how can one be stable and steady? How can the unseen be seen?"<br>
  Listen, O master; Nanak prays truly. Instruct your own mind.<br>
  The Gurmukh is lovingly attuned to the True Shabad. Bestowing His Glance of Grace, He unites us in His Union.<br>
  He Himself is all-knowing and all-seeing. By perfect destiny, we merge in Him. ||58||<br>
  That Shabad dwells deep within the nucleus of all beings. God is invisible; wherever I look, there I see Him.<br>
  The air is the dwelling place of the absolute Lord. He has no qualities; He has all qualities.<br>
  When He bestows His Glance of Grace, the Shabad comes to abide within the heart, and doubt is eradicated from within.<br>
  The body and mind become immaculate, through the Immaculate Word of His Bani. Let His Name be enshrined in your mind.<br>
  The Shabad is the Guru, to carry you across the terrifying world-ocean. Know the One Lord alone, here and hereafter.<br>
  He has no form or color, shadow or illusion; O Nanak, realize the Shabad. ||59||<br>
  O reclusive hermit, the True, Absolute Lord is the support of the exhaled breath, which extends out ten finger lengths.<br>
  The Gurmukh speaks and churns the essence of reality, and realizes the unseen, infinite Lord.<br>
  Eradicating the three qualities, he enshrines the Shabad within, and then, his mind is rid of egotism.<br>
  Inside and out, he knows the One Lord alone; he is in love with the Name of the Lord.<br>
  He understands the Sushmana, Ida and Pingala, when the unseen Lord reveals Himself.<br>
  O Nanak, the True Lord is above these three energy channels. Through the Word, the Shabad of the True Guru, one merges with Him. ||60||<br>
  "The air is said to be the soul of the mind. But what does the air feed on?<br>
  What is the way of the spiritual teacher, and the reclusive hermit? What is the occupation of the Siddha?"<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 070</h2></center>
  Without the Shabad, the essence does not come, O hermit, and the thirst of egotism does not depart.<br>
  Imbued with the Shabad, one finds the ambrosial essence, and remains fulfilled with the True Name.<br>
  "What is that wisdom, by which one remains steady and stable? What food brings satisfaction?"<br>
  O Nanak, when one looks upon pain and pleasure alike, through the True Guru, then he is not consumed by Death. ||61||<br>
  If one is not imbued with the Lord's Love, nor intoxicated with His subtle essence,<br>
  without the Word of the Guru's Shabad, he is frustrated, and consumed by his own inner fire.<br>
  He does not preserve his semen and seed, and does not chant the Shabad.<br>
  He does not control his breath; he does not worship and adore the True Lord.<br>
  But one who speaks the Unspoken Speech, and remains balanced,<br>
  O Nanak, attains the Lord, the Supreme Soul. ||62||<br>
  By Guru's Grace, one is attuned to the Lord's Love.<br>
  Drinking in the Ambrosial Nectar, he is intoxicated with the Truth.<br>
  Contemplating the Guru, the fire within is put out.<br>
  Drinking in the Ambrosial Nectar, the soul settles in peace.<br>
  Worshipping the True Lord in adoration, the Gurmukh crosses over the river of life.<br>
  O Nanak, after deep contemplation, this is understood. ||63||<br>
  "Where does this mind-elephant live? Where does the breath reside?<br>
  Where should the Shabad reside, so that the wanderings of the mind may cease?"<br>
  When the Lord blesses one with His Glance of Grace, he leads him to the True Guru. Then, this mind dwells in its own home within.<br>
  When the individual consumes his egotism, he becomes immaculate, and his wandering mind is restrained.<br>
  "How can the root, the source of all be realized? How can the soul know itself? How can the sun enter into the house of the moon?"<br>
  The Gurmukh eliminates egotism from within; then, O Nanak, the sun naturally enters into the home of the moon. ||64||<br>
  When the mind becomes steady and stable, it abides in the heart, and then the Gurmukh realizes the root, the source of all.<br>
  The breath is seated in the home of the navel; the Gurmukh searches, and finds the essence of reality.<br>
  This Shabad permeates the nucleus of the self, deep within, in its own home; the Light of this Shabad pervades the three worlds.<br>
  Hunger for the True Lord shall consume your pain, and through the True Lord, you shall be satisfied.<br>
  The Gurmukh knows the unstruck sound current of the Bani; how rare are those who understand.<br>
  Says Nanak, one who speaks the Truth is dyed in the color of Truth, which will never fade away. ||65||<br>
  "When this heart and body did not exist, where did the mind reside?<br>
  When there was no support of the navel lotus, then in which home did the breath reside?<br>
  When there was no form or shape, then how could anyone lovingly focus on the Shabad?<br>
  When there was no dungeon formed from egg and sperm, who could measure the Lord's value and extent?<br>
  When color, dress and form could not be seen, how could the True Lord be known?"<br>
  O Nanak, those who are attuned to the Naam, the Name of the Lord, are detached. Then and now, they see the Truest of the True. ||66||<br>
  When the heart and the body did not exist, O hermit, then the mind resided in the absolute, detached Lord.<br>
  When there was no support of the lotus of the navel, the breath remained in its own home, attuned to the Lord's Love.<br>
  When there was no form or shape or social class, then the Shabad, in its essence, resided in the unmanifest Lord.<br>
  When the world and the sky did not even exist, the Light of the Formless Lord filled the three worlds.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 071</h2></center>
  Color, dress and form were contained in the One Lord; the Shabad was contained in the One, Wondrous Lord.<br>
  Without the True Name, no one can become pure; O Nanak, this is the Unspoken Speech. ||67||<br>
  "How, in what way, was the world formed, O man? And what disaster will end it?"<br>
  In egotism, the world was formed, O man; forgetting the Naam, it suffers and dies.<br>
  One who becomes Gurmukh contemplates the essence of spiritual wisdom; through the Shabad, he burns away his egotism.<br>
  His body and mind become immaculate, through the Immaculate Bani of the Word. He remains absorbed in Truth.<br>
  Through the Naam, the Name of the Lord, he remains detached; he enshrines the True Name in his heart.<br>
  O Nanak, without the Name, Yoga is never attained; reflect upon this in your heart, and see. ||68||<br>
  The Gurmukh is one who reflects upon the True Word of the Shabad.<br>
  The True Bani is revealed to the Gurmukh.<br>
  The mind of the Gurmukh is drenched with the Lord's Love, but how rare are those who understand this.<br>
  The Gurmukh dwells in the home of the self, deep within.<br>
  The Gurmukh realizes the Way of Yoga.<br>
  O Nanak, the Gurmukh knows the One Lord alone. ||69||<br>
  Without serving the True Guru, Yoga is not attained;<br>
  without meeting the True Guru, no one is liberated.<br>
  Without meeting the True Guru, the Naam cannot be found.<br>
  Without meeting the True Guru, one suffers in terrible pain.<br>
  Without meeting the True Guru, there is only the deep darkness of egotistical pride.<br>
  O Nanak, without the True Guru, one dies, having lost the opportunity of this life. ||70||<br>
  The Gurmukh conquers his mind by subduing his ego.<br>
  The Gurmukh enshrines Truth in his heart.<br>
  The Gurmukh conquers the world; he knocks down the Messenger of Death, and kills it.<br>
  The Gurmukh does not lose in the Court of the Lord.<br>
  The Gurmukh is united in God's Union; he alone knows.<br>
  O Nanak, the Gurmukh realizes the Word of the Shabad. ||71||<br>
  This is the essence of the Shabad - listen, you hermits and Yogis. Without the Name, there is no Yoga.<br>
  Those who are attuned to the Name, remain intoxicated night and day; through the Name, they find peace.<br>
  Through the Name, everything is revealed; through the Name, understanding is obtained.<br>
  Without the Name, people wear all sorts of religious robes; the True Lord Himself has confused them.<br>
  The Name is obtained only from the True Guru, O hermit, and then, the Way of Yoga is found.<br>
  Reflect upon this in your mind, and see; O Nanak, without the Name, there is no liberation. ||72||<br>
  You alone know Your state and extent, Lord; What can anyone say about it?<br>
  You Yourself are hidden, and You Yourself are revealed. You Yourself enjoy all pleasures.<br>
  The seekers, the Siddhas, the many gurus and disciples wander around searching for You, according to Your Will.<br>
  They beg for Your Name, and You bless them with this charity. I am a sacrifice to the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan.<br>
  The eternal imperishable Lord God has staged this play; the Gurmukh understands it.<br>
  O Nanak, He extends Himself throughout the ages; there is no other than Him. ||73||1||<br>

  Vaar Of Raamkalee, Third Mehl,<br>
  To Be Sung To The Tune Of 'Jodha And Veera Poorbaanee':<br>
  Shalok, Third Mehl:<br>
  The True Guru is the field of intuitive wisdom. One who is inspired to love Him,<br>
  plants the seed of the Name there. The Name sprouts up, and he remains absorbed in the Name.<br>
  But this egotism is the seed of skepticism; it has been uprooted.<br>
  It is not planted there, and it does not sprout; whatever God grants us, we eat.<br>
  When water mixes with water, it cannot be separated again.<br>
  O Nanak, the Gurmukh is wonderful; come, poeple, and see!<br>
  But what can the poor people see? They do not understand.<br>
  He alone sees, whom the Lord causes to see; the Lord comes to dwell in his mind. ||1||<br>
  Third Mehl:<br>
  The self-willed manmukh is the field of sorrow and suffering. He plains sorrow, and eats sorrow.<br>
  In sorrow he is born, and in sorrow he dies. Acting in egotism, his life passes away.<br>
  He does not understand the coming and going of reincarnation; the blind man acts in blindness.<br>
  He does not know the One who gives, but he is attached to what is given.<br>
  O Nanak, he acts according to his pre-ordained destiny. He cannot do anything else. ||2||<br>
  Third Mehl:<br>
  Meeting the True Guru, everlasting peace is obtained. He Himself leads us to meet Him.<br>
  This is the true meaning of peace, that one becomes immaculate within oneself.<br>
  The doubt of ignorance is eradicated, and spiritual wisdom is obtained.<br>
  Nanak comes to gaze upon the One Lord alone; wherever he looks, there He is. ||3||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  The True Lord created His throne, upon which He sits.<br>
  He Himself is everything; this is what the Word of the Guru's Shabad says.<br>
  Through His almighty creative power, He created and fashioned the mansions and hotels.<br>
  He made the two lamps, the sun and the moon; He formed the perfect form.<br>
  He Himself sees, and He Himself hears; meditate on the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||1||<br>
  Waaho! Waaho! Hail, hail, O True King! True is Your Name. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Shalok:<br>
  Kabeer, I have ground myself into henna paste.<br>
  O my Husband Lord, You took no notice of me; You never applied me to Your feet. ||1||<br>
  Third Mehl:<br>
  O Nanak, my Husband Lord keeps me like henna paste; He blesses me with His Glance of Grace.<br>
  He Himself grinds me, and He Himself rubs me; He Himself applies me to His feet.<br>
  This is the cup of love of my Lord and Master; He gives it as He chooses. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  You created the world with its variety; by the Hukam of Your Command, it comes, goes, and merges again in You.<br>
  You Yourself see, and blossom forth; there is no one else at all.<br>
  As it pleases You, You keep me. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, I understand You.<br>
  You are the strength of all. As it pleases You, You lead us on.<br>
  There is no other as great as You; unto whom should I speak and talk? ||2||<br>
  Shalok, Third Mehl:<br>
  Deluded by doubt, I wandered over the whole world. Searching, I became frustrated.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 073</h2></center>
  My Husband Lord has not blessed me with peace and tranquility; what will work with Him?<br>
  By Guru's Grace, I meditate on the Lord; I enshrine Him deep within my heart.<br>
  O Nanak, seated in his her own home, she finds her Husband Lord, when the Creator Lord grants His Grace. ||1||<br>
  Third Mehl:<br>
  Chasing after worldly affairs, the day is wasted, and the night passes in sleep.<br>
  Speaking lies, one eats poison; the self-willed manmukh departs, crying out in pain.<br>
  The Mesenger of Death holds his club over the mortal's head; in the love of duality, he loses his honor.<br>
  He never even thinks of the Name of the Lord; over and over again, he comes and goes in reincarnation.<br>
  But if, by Guru's Grace, the Lord's Name comes to dwell in his mind, then the Messenger of Death will not strike him down with his club.<br>
  Then, O Nanak, he merges intuitively into the Lord, receiving His Grace. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  Some are linked to His Praises, when the Lord blesses them with the Guru's Teachings.<br>
  Some are blessed with the Name of the eternal, unchanging True Lord.<br>
  Water, air and fire, by His Will, worship Him.<br>
  They are held in the Fear of God; He has formed the perfect form.<br>
  The Hukam, the Command of the One Lord is all-pervasive; accepting it, peace is found. ||3||<br>
  Shalok:<br>
  Kabeer, such is the touchstone of the Lord; the false cannot even touch it.<br>
  He alone passes this test of the Lord, who remains dead while yet alive. ||1||<br>
  Third Mehl:<br>
  How can this mind be conquered? How can it be killed?<br>
  If one does not accept the Word of the Shabad, egotism does not depart.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, egotism is eradicated, and then, one is Jivan Mukta - liberated while yet alive.<br>
  O Nanak, one whom the Lord forgives is united with Him, and then no obstacles block his way. ||2||<br>
  Third Mehl:<br>
  Everyone can say that they are dead while yet alive; how can they be liberated while yet alive?<br>
  If someone restrains himself through the Fear of God, and takes the medicine of the Love of God,<br>
  night and day, he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. In celestial peace and poise, he crosses over the poisonous, terrifying world-ocean, through the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<br>
  O Nanak, the Gurmukh finds the Lord; he is blessed with His Glance of Grace. ||3||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  God created the love of duality, and the three modes which pervade the universe.<br>
  He created Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, who act according to His Will.<br>
  The Pandits, the religious scholars, and the astrologers study their books, but they do not understand contemplation.<br>
  Everything is Your play, O True Creator Lord.<br>
  As it pleases You, You bless us with forgiveness, and merge us in the True Word of the Shabad. ||4||<br>
  Shalok, Third Mehl:<br>
  The man of false mind practices falsehood.<br>
  He runs after Maya, and yet pretends to be a man of disciplined meditation.<br>
  Deluded by doubt, he visits all the sacred shrines of pilgrimage.<br>
  How can such a man of disciplined meditation attain the supreme status?<br>
  By Guru's Grace, one lives the Truth.<br>
  O Nanak, such a man of disciplined meditation attains liberation. ||1||<br>
  Third Mehl:<br>
  He alone is a man of disciplined meditation, who practices this self-discipline.<br>
  Meeting with the True Guru, he contemplates the Word of the Shabad.<br>
  Serving the True Guru - this is the only acceptable disciplined meditation.<br>
  O Nanak, such a man of disciplined meditation is honored in the Court of the Lord. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  He created the night and the day, for the activities of the world.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 074</h2></center>
  Following the Guru's Teachings, one's heart is illumined, and the darkness is dispelled.<br>
  By the Hukam of His Command, He creates everything; He pervades and permeates all the woods and meadows.<br>
  He Himself is everything; the Gurmukh constantly chants the Lord's Name.<br>
  Through the Shabad, understanding comes; the True Lord Himself inspires us to understand. ||5||<br>
  Shalok, Third Mehl:<br>
  He is not called a renunciate, whose consciousness is filled with doubt.<br>
  Donations to him bring proportionate rewards.<br>
  He hungers for the supreme status of the Fearless, Immaculate Lord;<br>
  O Nanak, how rare are those who offer him this food. ||1||<br>
  Third Mehl:<br>
  They are not called renunciates, who take food in the homes of others.<br>
  For the sake of their bellies, they wear various religious robes.<br>
  They alone are renunciates, O Nanak, who enter into their own souls.<br>
  They seek and find their Husband Lord; they dwell within the home of their own inner self. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  They sky and the earth are separate, but the True Lord supports them from within.<br>
  True are all those homes and gates, within which the True Name is enshrined.<br>
  The Hukam of the True Lord's Command is effective everywhere. The Gurmukh merges in the True Lord.<br>
  He Himself is True, and True is His throne. Seated upon it, He administers true justice.<br>
  The Truest of the True is all-pervading everywhere; the Gurmukh sees the unseen. ||6||<br>
  Shalok, Third Mehl:<br>
  In the world-ocean, the Infinite Lord abides. The false come and go in reincarnation.<br>
  One who walks according to his own will, suffers terrible punishment.<br>
  All things are in the world-ocean, but they are obtained only by the karma of good actions.<br>
  O Nanak, he alone obtains the nine treasures, who walks in the Will of the Lord. ||1||<br>
  Third Mehl:<br>
  One who intuitively serves the True Guru, loses his life in egotism.<br>
  His tongue does not taste the sublime essence of the Lord, and his heart-lotus does not blossom forth.<br>
  The self-willed manmukh eats poison and dies; he is ruined by love and attachment to Maya.<br>
  Without the Name of the One Lord, his life is cursed, and his home is cursed as well.<br>
  When God Himself bestows His Glance of Grace, then one becomes the slave of His slaves.<br>
  And then, night and day, he serves the True Guru, and never leaves His side.<br>
  As the lotus flower floats unaffected in the water, so does he remain detached in his own household.<br>
  O servant Nanak, the Lord acts, and inspires everyone to act, according to the Pleasure of His Will. He is the treasure of virtue. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  For thirty-six ages, there was utter darkness. Then, the Lord revealed Himself.<br>
  He Himself created the entire universe. He Himself blessed it with understanding.<br>
  He created the Simritees and the Shaastras; He calculates the accounts of virtue and vice.<br>
  He alone understands, whom the Lord inspires to understand and to be pleased with the True Word of the Shabad.<br>
  He Himself is all-pervading; He Himself forgives, and unites with Himself. ||7||<br>
  Shalok, Third Mehl:<br>
  This body is all blood; without blood, the body cannot exist.<br>
  Those who are attuned to their Lord - their bodies are not filled with the blood of greed.<br>
  In the Fear of God, the body becomes thin, and the blood of greed passes out of the body.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 075</h2></center>
  As fire purifies metal, so does the Fear of the Lord eradicate the filth of evil-mindedness.<br>
  O Nanak, beautiful are those humble beings, who are imbued with the Lord's Love. ||1||<br>
  Third Mehl:<br>
  In Raamkalee, I have enshrined the Lord in my mind; thus I have been embellished.<br>
  Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, my heart-lotus has blossomed forth; the Lord blessed me with the treasure of devotional worship.<br>
  My doubt was dispelled, and I woke up; the darkness of ignorance was dispelled.<br>
  She who is in love with her Lord, is the most infinitely beautiful.<br>
  Such a beautiful, happy soul-bride enjoys her Husband Lord forever.<br>
  The self-willed manmukhs do not know how to decorate themselves; wasting their whole lives, they depart.<br>
  Those who decorate themselves without devotional worship to the Lord, are continually reincarnated to suffer.<br>
  They do not obtain respect in this world; the Creator Lord alone knows what will happen to them in the world hereafter.<br>
  O Nanak, the True Lord is the One and only; duality exists only in the world.<br>
  He Himself enjoins them to good and bad; they do only that which the Creator Lord causes them to do. ||2||<br>
  Third Mehl:<br>
  Without serving the True Guru, tranquility is not obtained. It cannot be found anywhere else.<br>
  No matter how much one may long for it, without the karma of good actions, it cannot be found.<br>
  Those whose inner beings are filled with greed and corruption, are ruined through the love of duality.<br>
  The cycle of birth and death is not ended, and filled with egotism, they suffer in pain.<br>
  Those who focus their consciousness on the True Guru, do not remain unfulfilled.<br>
  They are not summoned by the Messenger of Death, and they do not suffer in pain.<br>
  O Nanak, the Gurmukh is saved, merging in the True Word of the Shabad. ||3||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  He Himself remains unattached forever; all others run after worldly affairs.<br>
  He Himself is eternal, unchanging and unmoving; the others continue coming and going in reincarnation.<br>
  Meditating on the Lord forever and ever, the Gurmukh finds peace.<br>
  He dwells in the home of his own inner being, absorbed in the Praise of the True Lord.<br>
  The True Lord is profound and unfathomable; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, He is understood. ||8||<br>
  Shalok, Third Mehl:<br>
  Meditate on the True Name; the True Lord is all-pervading.<br>
  O Nanak, one who realizes the Hukam of the Lord's Command, obtains the fruit of Truth.<br>
  One who merely mouths the words, does not understand the Hukam of the True Lord's Command.<br>
  O Nanak, one who accepts the Will of the Lord is His devotee. Without accepting it, he is the falsest of the false. ||1||<br>
  Third Mehl:<br>
  The self-willed manmukhs do not know what they are saying. They are filled with sexual desire, anger and egotism.<br>
  They do not understand right places and wrong places; they are filled with greed and corruption.<br>
  They come, and sit and talk for their own purposes. The Messenger of Death strikes them down.<br>
  Hereafter, they are called to account in the Court of the Lord; the false ones are struck down and humiliated.<br>
  How can this filth of falsehood be washed off? Can anyone think about this, and find the way?<br>
  If one meets with the True Guru, He implants the Naam, the Name of the Lord within; all his sins are destroyed.<br>
  Let all bow in humility to that humble being who chants the Naam, and worships the Naam in adoration.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 076</h2></center>
  The Naam washes off the filth of falsehood; chanting the Naam, one becomes truthful.<br>
  O servant Nanak, wondrous are the plays of the Lord, the Giver of life. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  You are the Great Giver; no other is as great as You. Unto whom should I speak and talk?<br>
  By Guru's Grace, I find You; You eradicate egotism from within.<br>
  You are beyond sweet and salty flavors; True is Your glorious greatness.<br>
  You bless those whom You forgive, and unite them with Yourself.<br>
  You have placed the Ambrosial Nectar deep within the heart; the Gurmukh drinks it in. ||9||<br>
  Shalok, Third Mehl:<br>
  The stories of one's ancestors make the children good children.<br>
  They accept what is pleasing to the Will of the True Guru, and act accordingly.<br>
  Go and consult the Simritees, the Shaastras, the writings of Vyaas, Suk Dayv, Naarad, and all those who preach to the world.<br>
  Those, whom the True Lord attaches, are attached to the Truth; they contemplate the True Name forever.<br>
  O Nanak, their coming into the world is approved; they redeem all their ancestors. ||1||<br>
  Third Mehl:<br>
  The disciples whose teacher is blind, act blindly as well.<br>
  They walk according to their own wills, and continually speak falsehood and lies.<br>
  They practice falsehood and deception, and endlessly slander others.<br>
  Slandering others, they drown themselves, and drown all their generations as well.<br>
  O Nanak, whatever the Lord links them to, to that they are linked; what can the poor creatures do? ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  He keeps all under His Gaze; He created the entire Universe.<br>
  He has linked some to falsehood and deception; these self-willed manmukhs are plundered.<br>
  The Gurmukhs meditate on the Lord forever; their inner beings are filled with love.<br>
  Those who have the treasure of virtue, chant the Praises of the Lord.<br>
  O Nanak, meditate on the Naam, and the Glorious Praises of the True Lord. ||10||<br>
  Shalok, First Mehl:<br>
  Men of charity gather wealth by committing sins, and then give it away in donations to charity.<br>
  Their spiritual teachers go to their homes to instruct them.<br>
  The woman loves the man only for his wealth;<br>
  they come and go as they please.<br>
  No one obeys the Shaastras or the Vedas.<br>
  Everyone worships himself.<br>
  Becoming judges, they sit and administer justice.<br>
  They chant on their malas, and call upon God.<br>
  They accept bribes, and block justice.<br>
  If someone asks them, they read quotations from their books.<br>
  The Muslim scriptures are in their ears and in their hearts.<br>
  They plunder the people, and engage in gossip and flattery.<br>
  They anoint their kitchens to try to become pure.<br>
  Behold, such is the Hindu.<br>
  The Yogi, with matted hair and ashes on his body, has become a householder.<br>
  The children weep in front of him and behind him.<br>
  He does not attain Yoga - he has lost his way.<br>
  Why does he apply ashes to his forehead?<br>
  O Nanak, this is the sign of the Dark Age of Kali Yuga;<br>
  everyone says that he himself knows. ||1||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  The Hindu comes to the house of a Hindu.<br>
  He puts the sacred thread around his neck and reads the scriptures.<br>
  He puts on the thread, but does evil deeds.<br>
  His cleansings and washings will not be approved.<br>
  The Muslim glorifies his own faith.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 077</h2></center>
  Without the Guru or a spiritual teacher, no one is accepted.<br>
  They may be shown the way, but only a few go there.<br>
  Without the karma of good actions, heaven is not attained.<br>
  The Way of Yoga is demonstrated in the Yogi's monastery.<br>
  They wear ear-rings to show the way.<br>
  Wearing ear-rings, they wander around the world.<br>
  The Creator Lord is everywhere.<br>
  There are as many travellers as there are beings.<br>
  When one's death warrant is issued, there is no delay.<br>
  One who knows the Lord here, realizes Him there as well.<br>
  Others, whether Hindu or Muslim, are just babbling.<br>
  Everyone's account is read in the Court of the Lord;<br>
  without the karma of good actions, no one crosses over.<br>
  One who speaks the True Name of the True Lord,<br>
  O Nanak, is not called to account hereafter. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  The fortress of the body is called the Mansion of the Lord.<br>
  The rubies and gems are found within it; the Gurmukh chants the Name of the Lord.<br>
  The body, the Mansion of the Lord, is very beautiful, when the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is implanted deep within.<br>
  The self-willed manmukhs ruin themselves; they boil continuously in attachment to Maya.<br>
  The One Lord is the Master of all. He is found only by perfect destiny. ||11||<br>
  Shalok, First Mehl:<br>
  There is no Truth in suffering, there is no Truth in comfort. There is no Truth in wandering like animals through the water.<br>
  There is no Truth in shaving one's head; there is no Truth is studying the scriptures or wandering in foreign lands.<br>
  There is no Truth in trees, plants or stones, in mutilating oneself or suffering in pain.<br>
  There is no Truth in binding elephants in chains; there is no Truth in grazing cows.<br>
  He alone grants it, whose hands hold spritual perfection; he alone receives it, unto whom it is given.<br>
  O Nanak, he alone is blessed with glorious greatness, whose heart is filled with the Word of the Shabad.<br>
  God says, all hearts are mine, and I am in all hearts. Who can explain this to one who is confused?<br>
  Who can confuse that being, unto whom I have shown the Way?<br>
  And who can show the Path to that being whom I have confused since the beginning of time? ||1||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  He alone is a householder, who restrains his passions<br>
  and begs for meditation, austerity and self-discipline.<br>
  He gives donations to charity with his body;<br>
  such a householder is as pure as the water of the Ganges.<br>
  Says Eeshar, the Lord is the embodiment of Truth.<br>
  The supreme essence of reality has no shape or form. ||2||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  He alone is a detached hermit, who burns away his self-conceit.<br>
  He begs for suffering as his food.<br>
  In the city of the heart, he begs for charity.<br>
  Such a renunciate ascends to the City of God.<br>
  Says Gorakh, God is the embodiment of Truth;<br>
  the supreme essence of reality has no shape or form. ||3||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  He alone is an Udasi, a shaven-headed renunciate, who embraces renunciation.<br>
  He sees the Immaculate Lord dwelling in both the upper and lower regions.<br>
  He balances the sun and the moon energies.<br>
  The body-wall of such an Udasi does not collapse.<br>
  Says Gopi Chand, God is the embodiment of Truth;<br>
  the supreme essence of reality has no shape or form. ||4||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  He alone is a Paakhandi, who cleanses his body of filth.<br>
  The fire of his body illuminates God within.<br>

 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 078</h2></center>
  Such a Paakhandi does not grow old or die.<br>
  Says Charpat, God is the embodiment of Truth;<br>
  the supreme essence of reality has no shape or form. ||5||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  He alone is a Bairaagi, who turns himself toward God.<br>
  In the Tenth Gate, the sky of the mind, he erects his pillar.<br>
  Night and day, he remains in deep inner meditation.<br>
  Such a Bairaagi is just like the True Lord.<br>
  Says Bhart'har, God is the embodiment of Truth;<br>
  the supreme essence of reality has no shape or form. ||6||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  How is evil eradicated? How can the true way of life be found?<br>
  What is the use of piercing the ears, or begging for food?<br>
  Throughout existence and non-existence, there is only the Name of the One Lord.<br>
  What is that Word, which holds the heart in its place?<br>
  When you look alike upon sunshine and shade,<br>
  says Nanak, then the Guru will speak to you.<br>
  The students follow the six systems.<br>
  They are neither worldly people, nor detached renunciates.<br>
  One who remains absorbed in the Formless Lord<br>
  - why should he go out begging? ||7||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  That alone is said to be the Lord's temple, where the Lord is known.<br>
  In the human body, the Guru's Word is found, when one understands that the Lord, the Supreme Soul, is in all.<br>
  Don't look for Him outside your self. The Creator, the Architect of Destiny, is within the home of your own heart.<br>
  The self-willed manmukh does not appreciate the value of the Lord's temple; they waste away and lose their lives.<br>
  The One Lord is pervading in all; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, He can be found. ||12||<br>
  Shalok, Third Mehl:<br>
  Only a fool listens to the words of the fool.<br>
  What are the signs of the fool? What does the fool do?<br>
  A fool is stupid; he dies of egotism.<br>
  His actions always bring him pain; he lives in pain.<br>
  If someone's beloved friend falls into the pit, what can be used to pull him out?<br>
  One who becomes Gurmukh contemplates the Lord, and remains detached.<br>
  Chanting the Lord's Name, he saves himself, and he carries across those who are drowning as well.<br>
  O Nanak, he acts in accordance with the Will of God; he endures whatever he is given. ||1||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  Says Nanak, listen, O mind, to the True Teachings.<br>
  Opening His ledger, God will call you to account.<br>
  Those rebels who have unpaid accounts shall be called out.<br>
  Azraa-eel, the Angel of Death, shall be appointed to punish them.<br>
  They will find no way to escape coming and going in reincarnation; they are trapped in the narrow path.<br>
  Falsehood will come to an end, O Nanak, and Truth will prevail in the end. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  The body and everything belongs to the Lord; the Lord Himself is all-pervading.<br>
  The Lord's value cannot be estimated; nothing can be said about it.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, one praises the Lord, imbued with feelings of devotion.<br>
  The mind and body are totally rejuvenated, and egotism is eradicated.<br>
  Everything is the play of the Lord. The Gurmukh understands this. ||13||<br>

  Paras Raam returned home crying.<br>

  The Pandit, the religious scholar, weeps when his learning is gone.<br>
  The young woman weeps because she has no husband.<br>
  O Nanak, the whole world is suffering.<br>
  He alone is victorious, who believes in the Lord's Name.<br>
  No other action is of any account. ||1||<br>
  Second Mehl:<br>
  Meditation, austerity and everything come through belief in the Lord's Name. All other actions are useless.<br>
  O Nanak, believe in the One who is worth believing in. By Guru's Grace, he is realized. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  The union of the body and the soul-swan was pre-ordained by the Creator Lord.<br>
  He is hidden, and yet pervading all. He is revealed to the Gurmukh.<br>
  Singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and chanting His Praises, one merges in His Glories.<br>
  True is the True Word of the Guru's Bani. One unites in Union with the True Lord.<br>
  He Himself is everything; He Himself grants glorious greatness. ||14||<br>
  Shalok, Second Mehl:<br>
  O Nanak, the blind man may go to appraise the jewels,<br>
  but he will not know their value; he will return home after exposing his ignorance. ||1||<br>
  Second Mehl:<br>
  The Jeweller has come, and opened up the bag of jewels.<br>
  The merchandise and the merchant are merged together.<br>
  They alone purchase the gem, O Nanak, who have virtue in their purse.<br>
  Those who do not appreciate the value of the jewels, wander like blind men in the world. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  The fortress of the body has nine gates; the tenth gate is kept hidden.<br>
  The rigid door is not open; only through the Word of the Guru's Shabad can it be opened.<br>
  The unstruck sound current resounds and vibrates there. The Word of the Guru's Shabad is heard.<br>
  Deep within the nucleus of the heart, the Divine Light shines forth. Through devotional worship, one meets the Lord.<br>
  The One Lord is pervading and permeating all. He Himself created the creation. ||15||<br>
  Shalok, Second Mehl:<br>
  He is truly blind, who follows the way shown by the blind man.<br>
  O Nanak, why should the one who can see, get lost?<br>
  Do not call them blind, who have no eyes in their face.<br>
  They alone are blind, O Nanak, who wander away from their Lord and Master. ||1||<br>
  Second Mehl:<br>
  One whom the Lord has made blind - the Lord can make him see again.<br>
  He acts only as he knows, although he may be spoken to a hundred times.<br>

  Night is the summer season, and day is the winter season; sexual desire and anger are the two fields planted.<br>
  Greed prepares the soil, and the seed of falsehood is planted; attachment and love are the farmer and hired hand.<br>

  First Mehl:<br>
  Make the Fear of God the farm, purity the water, truth and contentment the cows and bulls,<br>

  The self-willed manmukh is trapped in the darkness of emotional attachment; in the love of duality he speaks.<br>
  The love of duality brings pain forever; he churns the water endlessly.<br>

  Shalok, Second Mehl:<br>
  O Nanak, don't be anxious; the Lord will take care of you.<br>
  He created the creatures in water, and He gives them their nourishment.<br>
  There are no stores open there, and no one farms there.<br>
  No business is ever transacted there, and no one buys or sells.<br>
  Animals eat other animals; this is what the Lord has given them as food.<br>

  Shalok, First Mehl:<br>
  The cotton is ginned, woven and spun;<br>
  the cloth is laid out, washed and bleached white.<br>
  The tailor cuts it with his scissors, and sews it with his thread.<br>
  Thus, the torn and tattered honor is sewn up again, through the Lord's Praise, O Nanak, and one lives the true life.<br>
  Becoming worn, the cloth is torn; with needle and thread it is sewn up again.<br>
  It will not last for a month, or even a week. It barely lasts for an hour, or even a moment.<br>

  First Mehl:<br>
  The knife is Truth, and its steel is totally True.<br>
  Its workmanship is incomparably beautiful.<br>
  It is sharpened on the grindstone of the Shabad.<br>
  It is placed in the scabbard of virtue.<br>
  If the Shaykh is killed with that,<br>
  then the blood of greed will spill out.<br>
  One who is slaughtered in this ritualistic way, will be attached to the Lord.<br>
  O Nanak, at the Lord's door, he is absorbed into His Blessed Vision. ||2||<br>

  Pauree:<br>
  They alone walk as Gurmukh, who receive the Shabad in the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation.<br>
  Meditating on the True Lord, they become truthful; they carry in their robes the supplies of the Lord's wealth.<br>
  The devotees look beautiful, singing the Praises of the Lord; following the Guru's Teachings, they become stable and unchanging.<br>
  They enshrine the jewel of contemplation within their minds, and the most sublime Word of the Guru's Shabad.<br>
  He Himself unites in His Union; He Himself grants glorious greatness. ||19||<br>

  Shalok, First Mehl:<br>
  The union between the lake of the True Guru, and the swan of the soul, was pre-ordained from the very beginning, by the Pleasure of the Lord's Will.<br>
  The diamonds are in this lake; they are the food of the swans.<br>
  The cranes and the ravens may be very wise, but they do not remain in this lake.<br>
  They do not find their food there; their food is different.<br>
  Practicing Truth, the True Lord is found. False is the pride of the false.<br>
  O Nanak, they alone meet the True Guru, who are so pre-destined by the Lord's Command. ||1||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  My Lord and Master is immaculate, as are those who think of Him.<br>
  O Nanak, serve Him, who gives to you forever and ever.<br>
  O Nanak, serve Him; by serving Him, sorrow is dispelled.<br>
  Faults and demerits vanish, and virtues take their place; peace comes to dwell in the mind. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  He Himself is all-pervading; He Himself is absorbed in the profound state of Samaadhi.<br>
  He Himself instructs; the Gurmukh is satisfied and fulfilled.<br>
  Some, He causes to wander in the wilderness, while others are committed to His devotional worship.<br>
  He alone understands, whom the Lord causes to understand; He Himself attaches mortals to His Name.<br>
  O Nanak, meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, true greatness is obtained. ||21||1||<br>

  Friendship with the self-willed manmukhs is an alliance with Maya.<br>
  As we watch, they run away; they never stand firm.<br>
  As long as they get food and clothing, they stick around.<br>

  The self-willed manmukhs are ignorant and blind; they do not know the secrets of the soul.<br>

  The blind do not understand themselves; they are engrossed in false worldly entanglements.<br>

  My mind and body are enraptured, when the Lord blesses me, even for an instant, with His Glance of Grace.<br>
  The nine treasures, and the treasure of the Naam are obtained by commitment to the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<br>

  O deer-eyed bride, I speak the Truth, which shall save you.<br>

  You have fallen in love with an evil person; tell me - show me why!<br>
  I lack nothing, and I am not sad or depressed; I have no deficiency at all.<br>
  I abandoned and lost my fascinating and beautiful Husband Lord; in this evil-mindedness, I have lost my good fortune.<br>
  I am not mistaken, and I am not confused; I have no egotism, and commit no offense.<br>

  Blind inwardly, and blind outwardly, he sings falsely, falsely.<br>
  He washes his body, and draws ritual marks on it, and totally runs after wealth.<br>
  But the filth of his egotism is not removed from within, and over and over again, he comes and goes in reincarnation.<br>
  Engulfed in sleep, and tormented by frustrated sexual desire, he chants the Lord's Name with his mouth.<br>
  He is called a Vaishnav, but he is bound to deeds of egotism; by threshing only husks, what rewards can be obtained?<br>
  Sitting among the swans, the crane does not become one of them; sitting there, he keeps staring at the fish.<br>
  And when the gathering of swans looks and sees, they realize that they can never form an alliance with the crane.<br>
  The swans peck at the diamonds and pearls, while the crane chases after frogs.<br>
  The poor crane flies away, so that his secret will not be exposed.<br>
  Whatever the Lord attaches one to, to that he is attached. Who is to blame, when the Lord wills it so?<br>
  The True Guru is the lake, overflowing with pearls. One who meets the True Guru obtains them.<br>
  The Sikh-swans gather at the lake, according to the Will of the True Guru.<br>
  The lake is filled with the wealth of these jewels and pearls; they are spent and consumed, but they never run out.<br>
  The swan never leaves the lake; such is the Pleasure of the Creator's Will.<br>
  O servant Nanak, one who has such pre-ordained destiny inscribed upon his forehead - that Sikh comes to the Guru.<br>
  He saves himself, and saves all his generations as well; he emancipates the whole world. ||1||<br>
  Fifth Mehl:<br>
  He is called a Pandit, a religious scholar, and yet he wanders along many pathways. He is as hard as uncooked beans.<br>
  He is filled with attachment, and constantly engrossed in doubt; his body cannot hold still.<br>
  False is his coming, and false is his going; he is continually on the lookout for Maya.<br>
  If someone speaks the truth, then he is aggravated; he is totally filled with anger.<br>
  The evil fool is engrossed in evil-mindedness and false intellectualizations; his mind is attached to emotional attachment.<br>
  The deceiver abides with the five deceivers; it is a gathering of like minds.<br>
  And when the Jeweller, the True Guru, appraises him, then he is exposed as mere iron.<br>
  Mixed and mingled with others, he was passed off as genuine in many places; but now, the veil has been lifted, and he stands naked before all.<br>
  One who comes to the Sanctuary of the True Guru, shall be transformed from iron into gold.<br>
  The True Guru has no anger or vengeance; He looks upon son and enemy alike. Removing faults and mistakes, He purifies the human body.<br>

  Vaar Of Raamkalee, Uttered By Satta And Balwand The Drummer:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  One who chants the Name of the Almighty Creator - how can his words be judged?<br>
  His divine virtues are the true sisters and brothers; through them, the gift of supreme status is obtained.<br>
  Nanak established the kingdom; He built the true fortress on the strongest foundations.<br>
  He installed the royal canopy over Lehna's head; chanting the Lord's Praises, He drank in the Ambrosial Nectar.<br>
  The Guru implanted the almighty sword of the Teachings to illuminate his soul.<br>
  The Guru bowed down to His disciple, while Nanak was still alive.<br>
  The King, while still alive, applied the ceremonial mark to his forehead. ||1||<br>
  Nanak proclaimed Lehna's succession - he earned it.<br>
  They shared the One Light and the same way; the King just changed His body.<br>
  The immaculate canopy waves over Him, and He sits on the throne in the Guru's shop.<br>
  He does as the Guru commands; He tasted the tasteless stone of Yoga.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 092</h2></center>
  The Langar - the Kitchen of the Guru's Shabad has been opened, and its supplies never run short.<br>
  Whatever His Master gave, He spent; He distributed it all to be eaten.<br>
  The Praises of the Master were sung, and the Divine Light descended from the heavens to the earth.<br>
  Gazing upon You, O True King, the filth of countless past lives is washed away.<br>
  The Guru gave the True Command; why should we hesitate to proclaim this?<br>
  His sons did not obey His Word; they turned their backs on Him as Guru.<br>
  These evil-hearted ones became rebellious; they carry loads of sin on their backs.<br>
  Whatever the Guru said, Lehna did, and so he was installed on the throne.<br>
  Who has lost, and who has won? ||2||<br>
  He who did the work, is accepted as Guru; so which is better - the thistle or the rice?<br>
  The Righteous Judge of Dharma considered the arguments and made the decision.<br>
  Whatever the True Guru says, the True Lord does; it comes to pass instantaneously.<br>
  Guru Angad was proclaimed, and the True Creator confirmed it.<br>
  Nanak merely changed his body; He still sits on the throne, with hundreds of branches reaching out.<br>
  Standing at His door, His followers serve Him; by this service, their rust is scraped off.<br>
  He is the Dervish - the Saint, at the door of His Lord and Master; He loves the True Name, and the Bani of the Guru's Word.<br>
  Balwand says that Khivi, the Guru's wife, is a noble woman, who gives soothing, leafy shade to all.<br>
  She distributes the bounty of the Guru's Langar; the kheer - the rice pudding and ghee, is like sweet ambrosia.<br>
  The faces of the Guru's Sikhs are radiant and bright; the self-willed manmukhs are pale, like straw.<br>
  The Master gave His approval, when Angad exerted Himself heroically.<br>
  Such is the Husband of mother Khivi; He sustains the world. ||3||<br>
  It is as if the Guru made the Ganges flow in the opposite direction, and the world wonders: what has he done?<br>
  Nanak, the Lord, the Lord of the World, spoke the words out loud.<br>
  Making the mountain his churning stick, and the snake-king his churning string, He has churned the Word of the Shabad.<br>
  From it, He extracted the fourteen jewels, and illuminated the world.<br>
  He revealed such creative power, and touched such greatness.<br>
  He raised the royal canopy to wave over the head of Lehna, and raised His glory to the skies.<br>
  His Light merged into the Light, and He blended Him into Himself.<br>
  Guru Nanak tested His Sikhs and His sons, and everyone saw what happened.<br>
  When Lehna alone was found to be pure, then He was set on the throne. ||4||<br>
  Then, the True Guru, the son of Pheru, came to dwell at Khadoor.<br>
  Meditation, austerities and self-discipline rest with You, while the others are filled with excessive pride.<br>
  Greed ruins mankind, like the green algae in the water.<br>
  In the Guru's Court, the Divine Light shines in its creative power.<br>
  You are the cooling peace, whose depth cannot be found.<br>
  You are overflowing with the nine treasures, and the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<br>
  Whoever slanders You will be totally ruined and destroyed.<br>
  People of the world can see only what is near at hand, but You can see far beyond.<br>
  Then the True Guru, the son of Pheru, came to dwell at Khadoor. ||5||<br>

  He took the thousand-headed serpent as his churning string, and with the force of devotional love, he churned the ocean of the world with his churning stick, the Sumayr mountain.<br>
  He extracted the fourteen jewels, and brought forth the Divine Light.<br>
  He made intuition his horse, and chastity his saddle.<br>
  He placed the arrow of the Lord's Praise in the bow of Truth.<br>
  In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, there was only pitch darkness. Then, He rose like the sun to illuminate the darkness.<br>
  He farms the field of Truth, and spreads out the canopy of Truth.<br>
  Your kitchen always has ghee and flour to eat.<br>
  You understand the four corners of the universe; in your mind, the Word of the Shabad is approved and supreme.<br>
  You eliminate the comings and goings of reincarnation, and bestow the insignia of Your Glance of Grace.<br>
  You are the Avataar, the Incarnation of the all-knowing Primal Lord.<br>
  You are not pushed or shaken by the storm and the wind; you are like the Sumayr Mountain.<br>
  You know the inner state of the soul; You are the Knower of knowers.<br>
  How can I praise You, O True Supreme King, when You are so wise and all-knowing?<br>
  Those blessings granted by the Pleasure of the True Guru - please bless Satta with those gifts.<br>
  Seeing Nanak's canopy waving over Your head, everyone was astonished.<br>
  The same mark on the forehead, the same throne, and the same Royal Court.<br>
  Just like the father and grandfather, the son is approved. ||6||<br>
  Blessed, blessed is Guru Raam Daas; He who created You, has also exalted You.<br>
  Perfect is Your miracle; the Creator Lord Himself has installed You on the throne.<br>
  The Sikhs and all the Congregation recognize You as the Supreme Lord God, and bow down to You.<br>
  You are unchanging, unfathomable and immeasurable; You have no end or limitation.<br>
  Those who serve You with love - You carry them across.<br>
  Greed, envy, sexual desire, anger and emotional attachment - You have beaten them and driven them out.<br>
  Blessed is Your place, and True is Your magnificent glory.<br>
  You are Nanak, You are Angad, and You are Amar Daas; so do I recognize You.<br>
  When I saw the Guru, then my mind was comforted and consoled. ||7||<br>
  The four Gurus enlightened the four ages; the Lord Himself assumed the fifth form.<br>
  He created Himself, and He Himself is the supporting pillar.<br>
  He Himself is the paper, He Himself is the pen, and He Himself is the writer.<br>
  All His followers come and go; He alone is fresh and new.<br>
  Guru Arjun sits on the throne; the royal canopy waves over the True Guru.<br>
  From east to west, He illuminates the four directions.<br>
  Those self-willed manmukhs who do not serve the Guru die in shame.<br>
  Your miracles increase two-fold, even four-fold; this is the True Lord's true blessing.<br>
  The four Gurus enlightened the four ages; the Lord Himself assumed the fifth form. ||8||1||<br>

  Kabeer Jee:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Make your body the vat, and mix in the yeast. Let the Word of the Guru's Shabad be the molasses.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 094</h2></center>

  Is there any Saint, with intuitive peace and poise deep within, unto whom I might offer my meditation and austerities as payment?<br>
  I dedicate my body and mind to whoever gives me even a drop of this wine from such a vat. ||1||Pause||<br>
  I have made the fourteen worlds the furnace, and I have burnt my body with the fire of God.<br>
  My mudra - my hand-gesture, is the pipe; tuning into the celestial sound current within, the Shushmanaa - the central spinal channel, is my cooling pad. ||2||<br>
  Pilgrimages, fasting, vows, purifications, self-discipline, austerities and breath control through the sun and moon channels - all these I pledge.<br>
  My focused consciousness is the cup, and the Ambrosial Nectar is the pure juice. I drink in the supreme, sublime essence of this juice. ||3||<br>
  The pure stream constantly trickles forth, and my mind is intoxicated by this sublime essence.<br>
  Says Kabeer, all other wines are trivial and tasteless; this is the only true, sublime essence. ||4||1||<br>
  Make spiritual wisdom the molasses, meditation the flowers, and the Fear of God the fire enshrined in your mind.<br>
  The Shushmanaa, the central spinal channel, is intuitively balanced, and the drinker drinks in this wine. ||1||<br>
  O hermit Yogi, my mind is intoxicated.<br>
  When that wine rises up, one tastes the sublime essence of this juice, and sees across the three worlds. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Joining the two channels of the breath, I have lit the furnace, and I drink in the supreme, sublime essence.<br>
  I have burnt both sexual desire and anger, and I have been emancipated from the world. ||2||<br>
  The light of spiritual wisdom enlightens me; meeting with the Guru, the True Guru, I have obtained this understanding.<br>
  Slave Kabeer is intoxicated with that wine, which never wears off. ||3||2||<br>
  You are my Sumayr Mountain, O my Lord and Master; I have grasped Your Support.<br>
  You do not shake, and I do not fall. You have preserved my honor. ||1||<br>
  Now and then, here and there, You, only You.<br>
  By Your Grace, I am forever in peace. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Relying upon You, I can live even in the cursed place of Magahar; You have put out the fire of my body.<br>
  First, I obtained the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan in Magahar; then, I came to dwell at Benares. ||2||<br>
  As is Magahar, so is Benares; I see them as one and the same.<br>
  I am poor, but I have obtained this wealth of the Lord; the proud are bursting with pride, and die. ||3||<br>
  One who takes pride in himself is stuck with thorns; no one can pull them out.<br>
  Here, he cries bitterly, and hereafter, he burns in the most hideous hell. ||4||<br>
  What is hell, and what is heaven? The Saints reject them both.<br>
  I have no obligation to either of them, by the Grace of my Guru. ||5||<br>
  Now, I have mounted to the throne of the Lord; I have met the Lord, the Sustainer of the World.<br>
  The Lord and Kabeer have become one. No one can tell them apart. ||6||3||<br>
  I honor and obey the Saints, and punish the wicked; this is my duty as God's police officer.<br>
  Day and night, I wash Your feet, Lord; I wave my hair as the chauree, to brush away the flies. ||1||<br>
  I am a dog at Your Court, Lord.<br>

  Those who are branded with Your brand fight bravely in battle; those without Your brand run away.<br>
  One who becomes a Holy person, appreciates the value of devotional worship to the Lord. The Lord places him in His treasury. ||3||<br>
  In the fortress is the chamber; by contemplative meditation it becomes the supreme chamber.<br>
  The Guru has blessed Kabeer with the commodity, saying, "Take this commodity; cherish it and keep it secure."||4||<br>
  Kabeer gives it to the world, but he alone receives it, upon whose forehead such destiny is recorded.<br>
  Permanent is the marriage, of one who receives this ambrosial essence. ||5||4||<br>
  O Brahmin, how can you forget the One, from whose mouth the Vedas and the Gayitri prayer issured forth?<br>
  The whole world falls at His feet; why don't you chant the Name of that Lord, O Pandit? ||1||<br>
  Why, O my Brahmin, do you not chant the Lord's Name?<br>
  If you don't chant the Lord's Name, O Pandit, you will only suffer in hell. ||1||Pause||<br>
  You think that you are high, but you take food from the houses of the lowly; you fill up your belly by forcibly practicing your rituals.<br>
  On the fourteenth day, and the night of the new moon, you go out begging; even though you hold the lamp in your hands, still, you fall into the pit. ||2||<br>
  You are a Brahmin, and I am only a weaver from Benares. How can I compare to you?<br>
  Chanting the Lord's Name, I have been saved; relying on the Vedas, O Brahmin, you shall drown and die. ||3||5||<br>
  There is a single tree, with countless branches and twigs; its flowers and leaves are filled with its juice.<br>
  This world is a garden of Ambrosial Nectar. The Perfect Lord created it. ||1||<br>
  I have come to know the story of my Sovereign Lord.<br>
  How rare is that Gurmukh who knows, and whose inner being is illumined by the Lord's Light. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The bumble bee, addicted to the nectar of the twelve-petalled flowers, enshrines it in the heart.<br>
  He holds his breath suspended in the sixteen-petalled sky of the Akaashic Ethers, and beats his wings in esctasy. ||2||<br>
  In the profound void of intuitive Samaadhi, the one tree rises up; it soaks up the water of desire from the ground.<br>
  Says Kabeer, I am the servant of those who have seen this celestial tree. ||3||6||<br>
  Make silence your ear-rings, and compassion your wallet; let meditation be your begging bowl.<br>
  Sew this body as your patched coat, and take the Lord's Name as your support. ||1||<br>
  Practice such Yoga, O Yogi.<br>
  As Gurmukh, enjoy meditation, austerities and self-discipline. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Apply the ashes of wisdom to your body; let your horn be your focused consciousness.<br>
  Become detached, and wander through the city of your body; play the harp of your mind. ||2||<br>
  Enshrine the five tatvas - the five elements, within your heart; let your deep meditative trance be undisturbed.<br>
  Says Kabeer, listen, O Saints: make righteousness and compassion your garden. ||3||7||<br>
  For what purpose were you created and brought into the world? What rewards have you received in this life?<br>
  God is the boat to carry you across the terrifying world-ocean; He is the Fulfiller of the mind's desires. You have not centered your mind on Him, even for an instant. ||1||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 096</h2></center>
  O Lord of the Universe, I am such a sinner!<br>
  God gave me body and soul, but I have not practiced loving devotional worship to Him. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Others' wealth, others' bodies, others' wives, others' slander and others' fights - I have not given them up.<br>
  For the sake of these, coming and going in reincarnation happens over and over again, and this story never ends. ||2||<br>
  That house, in which the Saints speak of the Lord - I have not visited it, even for an instant.<br>
  Drunkards, thieves, and evil-doers - I constantly dwell with them. ||3||<br>
  Sexual desire, anger, the wine of Maya, and envy - these are what I collect within myself.<br>
  Compassion, righteousness, and service to the Guru - these do not visit me, even in my dreams. ||4||<br>
  He is merciful to the meek, compassionate and benevolent, the Lover of His devotees, the Destroyer of fear.<br>
  Says Kabeer, please protect Your humble servant from disaster; O Lord, I serve only You. ||5||8||<br>
  Remembering Him in meditation, the door of liberation is found.<br>
  You shall go to heaven, and not return to this earth.<br>
  In the home of the Fearless Lord, the celestial trumpets resound.<br>
  The unstruck sound current will vibrate and resonate forever. ||1||<br>
  Practice such meditative remembrance in your mind.<br>
  Without this meditative remembrance, liberation will never be found. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Remembering Him in meditation, you will meet with no obstruction.<br>
  You will be liberated, and the great load will be taken away.<br>
  Bow in humility within your heart,<br>
  and you will not have to be reincarnated over and over again. ||2||<br>
  Remember Him in meditation, celebrate and be happy.<br>
  God has placed His lamp deep within you, which burns without any oil.<br>
  That lamp makes the world immortal;<br>
  it conquers and drives out the poisons of sexual desire and anger. ||3||<br>
  Remembering Him in meditation, you shall obtain salvation.<br>
  Wear that meditative remembrance as your necklace.<br>
  Practice that meditative remembrance, and never let it go.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, you shall cross over. ||4||<br>
  Remembering Him in meditation, you shall not be obligated to others.<br>
  You shall sleep in your mansion, in blankets of silk.<br>
  Your soul shall blossom forth in happiness, on this comfortable bed.<br>
  So drink in this meditative remembrance, night and day. ||5||<br>
  Remembering Him in meditation, your troubles will depart.<br>
  Remembering Him in meditation, Maya will not bother you.<br>
  Meditate, meditate in remembrance on the Lord, Har, Har, and sing His Praises in your mind.<br>
  This meditative remembrance is obtained from the True Guru. ||6||<br>
  Forever and ever, remember Him, day and night,<br>
  while standing up and sitting down, with every breath and morsel of food.<br>
  While awake and asleep, enjoy the essence of this meditative remembrance.<br>
  The Lord's meditative remembrance is obtained by good destiny. ||7||<br>
  Remembering Him in meditation, you shall not be loaded down.<br>
  Make this meditative remembrance of the Lord's Name your Support.<br>
  Says Kabeer, He has no limits;<br>
  no tantras or mantras can be used against Him. ||8||9||<br>
  Raamkalee, Second House, The Word Of Kabeer Jee:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Maya, the Trapper, has sprung her trap.<br>
  The Guru, the Liberated One, has put out the fire.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 097</h2></center>
  When I came to understand this mind, from the tips of my toes to the crown of my head,<br>
  then I took my cleansing bath, deep within my self. ||1||<br>
  The mind, the master of the breath, abides in the state of supreme bliss.<br>
  There is no death, no re-birth, and no aging for me now. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Turning away from materialism, I have found intuitive support.<br>
  I have entered into the sky of the mind, and opened the Tenth Gate.<br>
  The chakras of the coiled Kundalini energy have been opened,<br>
  and I have met my Sovereign Lord King without fear. ||2||<br>
  My attachment to Maya has been eradicated;<br>
  the moon energy has devoured the sun energy.<br>
  When I was focused and merged into the all-pervading Lord,<br>
  then the unstruck sound current began to vibrate. ||3||<br>
  The Speaker has spoken, and proclaimed the Word of the Shabad.<br>
  The hearer has heard, and enshrined it in the mind.<br>
  Chanting to the Creator, one crosses over.<br>
  Says Kabeer, this is the essence. ||4||1||10||<br>
  The moon and the sun are both the embodiment of light.<br>
  Within their light, is God, the incomparable. ||1||<br>
  O spiritual teacher, contemplate God.<br>
  In this light is contained the expanse of the created universe. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Gazing upon the diamond, I humbly salute this diamond.<br>
  Says Kabeer, the Immaculate Lord is indescribable. ||2||2||11||<br>
  People of the world, remain awake and aware. Even though you are awake, you are being robbed, O Siblings of Destiny.<br>
  While the Vedas stand guard watching, the Messenger of Death carries you away. ||1||Pause||<br>
  He thinks that the bitter nimm fruit is a mango, and the mango is a bitter nimm. He imagines the ripe banana on the thorny bush.<br>
  He thinks that the ripe coconut hangs on the barren simmal tree; what a stupid, idiotic fool he is! ||1||<br>
  The Lord is like sugar, spilled onto the sand; the elephant cannot pick it up.<br>
  Says Kabeer, give up your ancestry, social status and honor; be like the tiny ant - pick up and eat the sugar. ||2||3||12||<br>
  The Word Of Naam Dayv Jee, Raamkalee, First House:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  The boy takes paper, cuts it and makes a kite, and flies it in the sky.<br>
  Talking with his friends, he still keeps his attention on the kite string. ||1||<br>
  My mind has been pierced by the Name of the Lord,<br>
  like the goldsmith, whose attention is held by his work. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The young girl in the city takes a pitcher, and fills it with water.<br>
  She laughs, and plays, and talks with her friends, but she keeps her attention focused on the pitcher of water. ||2||<br>
  The cow is let loose, out of the mansion of the ten gates, to graze in the field.<br>
  It grazes up to five miles away, but keeps its attention focused on its calf. ||3||<br>
  Says Naam Dayv, listen, O Trilochan: the child is laid down in the cradle.<br>
  Its mother is at work, inside and outside, but she holds her child in her thoughts. ||4||1||<br>
  There are countless Vedas, Puraanas and Shaastras; I do not sing their songs and hymns.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 098</h2></center>
  In the imperishable realm of the Formless Lord, I play the flute of the unstruck sound current. ||1||<br>
  Becoming detached, I sing the Lord's Praises.<br>
  Imbued with the unattached, unstruck Word of the Shabad, I shall go to the home of the Lord, who has no ancestors. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Then, I shall no longer control the breath through the energy channels of the Ida, Pingala and Shushmanaa.<br>
  I look upon both the moon and the sun as the same, and I shall merge in the Light of God. ||2||<br>
  I do not go to see sacred shrines of pilgrimage, or bathe in their waters; I do not bother any beings or creatures.<br>
  The Guru has shown me the sixty-eight places of pilgrimage within my own heart, where I now take my cleansing bath. ||3||<br>
  I do not pay attention to anyone praising me, or calling me good and nice.<br>
  Says Naam Dayv, my consciousness is imbued with the Lord; I am absorbed in the profound state of Samaadhi. ||4||2||<br>
  When there was no mother and no father, no karma and no human body,<br>
  when I was not and you were not, then who came from where? ||1||<br>
  O Lord, no one belongs to anyone else.<br>
  We are like birds perched on a tree. ||1||Pause||<br>
  When there was no moon and no sun, then water and air were blended together.<br>
  When there were no Shaastras and no Vedas, then where did karma come from? ||2||<br>
  Control of the breath and positioning of the tongue, focusing at the third eye and wearing malas of tulsi beads, are all obtained through Guru's Grace.<br>
  Naam Dayv prays, this is the supreme essence of reality; the True Guru has inspired this realization. ||3||3||<br>
  RAAMKALEE, SECOND HOUSE:<br>
  Someone may practice austerities at Benares, or die upside-down at a sacred shrine ofpilgrimage, or burn his body in fire, or rejuvenate his body to life almost forever;<br>
  he may perform the horse-sacrifice ceremony, or give donations of gold covered over, but none of these is equal to the worship of the Lord's Name. ||1||<br>
  O hypocrite, renounce and abandon your hypocrisy; do not practice deception.<br>
  Constantly, continually, chant the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Someone may go to the Ganges or the Godaavari, or to the Kumbha festival, or bathe at Kaydaar Naat'h, or make donations of thousands of cows at Gomti;<br>
  he may make millions of pilgrimages to sacred shrines, or freeze his body in the Himalayas; still, none of these is equal to the worship of the Lord's Name. ||2||<br>
  Someone may give away horses and elephants, or women on their beds, or land; he may give such gifts over and over again.<br>
  He may purify his soul, and give away in charity his body weight in gold; none of these is equal to the worship of the Lord's Name. ||3||<br>
  Do not harbor anger in your mind, or blame the Messenger of Death; instead, realize the immaculate state of Nirvaanaa.<br>
  My Sovereign Lord King is Raam Chandra, the Son of the King Dasrat'h; prays Naam Dayv, I drink in the Ambrosial Nectar. ||4||4||<br>
  Raamkalee, The Word Of Ravi Daas Jee:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  They read and reflect upon all the Names of God; they listen, but they do not see the Lord, the embodiment of love and intuition.<br>
  How can iron be transformed into gold, unless it touches the Philosopher's Stone? ||1||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 099</h2></center>
  O Divine Lord, the knot of skepticism cannot be untied.<br>
  Sexual desire, anger, Maya, intoxication and jealousy - these five have combined to plunder the world. ||1||Pause||<br>
  I am a great poet, of noble heritage; I am a Pandit, a religious scholar, a Yogi and a Sannyaasi;<br>
  I am a spiritual teacher, a warrior and a giver - such thinking never ends. ||2||<br>
  Says Ravi Daas, no one understands; they all run around, deluded like madmen.<br>
  The Lord's Name is my only Support; He is my life, my breath of life, my wealth. ||3||1||<br>
  Raamkalee, The Word Of Baynee Jee:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  The energy channels of the Ida, Pingala and Shushmanaa: these three dwell in one place.<br>
  This is the true place of confluence of the three sacred rivers: this is where my mind takes its cleansing bath. ||1||<br>
  O Saints, the Immaculate Lord dwells there;<br>
  how rare are those who go to the Guru, and understand this.<br>
  The all-pervading immaculate Lord is there. ||1||Pause||<br>
  What is the insignia of the Divine Lord's dwelling?<br>
  The unstruck sound current of the Shabad vibrates there.<br>
  There is no moon or sun, no air or water there.<br>
  The Gurmukh becomes aware, and knows the Teachings. ||2||<br>
  Spiritual wisdom wells up, and evil-mindedness departs;<br>
  the nucleus of the mind sky is drenched with Ambrosial Nectar.<br>
  One who knows the secret of this device,<br>
  meets the Supreme Divine Guru. ||3||<br>
  The Tenth Gate is the home of the inaccessible, infinite Supreme Lord.<br>
  Above the store is a niche, and within this niche is the commodity. ||4||<br>
  One who remains awake, never sleeps.<br>
  The three qualities and the three worlds vanish, in the state of Samaadhi.<br>
  He takes the Beej Mantra, the Seed Mantra, and keeps it in his heart.<br>
  Turning his mind away from the world, he focuses on the cosmic void of the absolute Lord. ||5||<br>
  He remains awake, and he does not lie.<br>
  He keeps the five sensory organs under his control.<br>
  He cherishes in his consciousness the Guru's Teachings.<br>
  He dedicates his mind and body to the Lord's Love. ||6||<br>
  He considers his hands to be the leaves and branches of the tree.<br>
  He does not lose his life in the gamble.<br>
  He plugs up the source of the river of evil tendencies.<br>
  Turning away from the west, he makes the sun rise in the east.<br>
  He bears the unbearable, and the drops trickle down within;<br>
  then, he speaks with the Lord of the world. ||7||<br>
  The four-sided lamp illuminates the Tenth Gate.<br>
  The Primal Lord is at the center of the countless leaves.<br>
  He Himself abides there with all His powers.<br>
  He weaves the jewels into the pearl of the mind. ||8||<br>
  The lotus is at the forehead, and the jewels surround it.<br>
  Within it is the Immaculate Lord, the Master of the three worlds.<br>
  The Panch Shabad, the five primal sounds, resound and vibrate their in their purity.<br>
  The chauris - the fly brushes wave, and the conch shells blare like thunder.<br>
  The Gurmukh tramples the demons underfoot with his spiritual wisdom.<br>
  Baynee longs for Your Name, Lord. ||9||1||<br>
