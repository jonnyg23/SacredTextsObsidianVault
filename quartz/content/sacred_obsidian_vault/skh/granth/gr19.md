 <hr><center><h1>Shri Guru Granth Sahib: Raag Soohee</h1></center>
 <center><h2>Section 19 - Raag Soohee - Part 001</h2></center>
  One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. No Fear. No Hatred. Image Of The Undying. Beyond Birth. Self-Existent. By Guru's Grace:<br>
  Raag Soohee, First Mehl, Chau-Padas, First House:<br>
  Wash the vessel, sit down and anoint it with fragrance; then, go out and get the milk.<br>
  Add the rennet of clear consciousness to the milk of good deeds, and then, free of desire, let it curdle. ||1||<br>
  Chant the Name of the One Lord.<br>
  All other actions are fruitless. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Let your mind be the handles, and then churn it, without sleeping.<br>
  If you chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord ,with your tongue, then the curd will be churned. In this way, the Ambrosial Nectar is obtained. ||2||<br>
  Wash your mind in the pool of Truth, and let it be the vessel of the Lord; let this be your offering to please Him.<br>
  That humble servant who dedicates and offers his life, and who serves in this way, remains absorbed in his Lord and Master. ||3||<br>
  The speakers speak and speak and speak, and then they depart. There is no other to compare to You.<br>
  Servant Nanak, lacking devotion, humbly prays: may I sing the Praises of the True Lord. ||4||1||<br>
  Soohee, First Mehl, Second House:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Deep within the self, the Lord abides; do not go outside looking for Him.<br>
  You have renounced the Ambrosial Nectar - why are you eating poison? ||1||<br>
  Meditate on such spiritual wisdom, O my mind,<br>
  and become the slave of the True Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Everyone speaks of wisdom and meditation;<br>
  but bound in bondage, the whole world is wandering around in confusion. ||2||<br>
  One who serves the Lord is His servant.<br>
  The Lord is pervading and permeating the water, the land, and the sky. ||3||<br>
  I am not good; no one is bad.<br>
  Prays Nanak, He alone saves us! ||4||1||2||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 19 - Raag Soohee - Part 002</h2></center>
  Soohee, First Mehl, Sixth House:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Bronze is bright and shiny, but when it is rubbed, its blackness appears.<br>
  Washing it, its impurity is not removed, even if it is washed a hundred times. ||1||<br>
  They alone are my friends, who travel along with me;<br>
  and in that place, where the accounts are called for, they appear standing with me. ||1||Pause||<br>
  There are houses, mansions and tall buildings, painted on all sides;<br>
  but they are empty within, and they crumble like useless ruins. ||2||<br>
  The herons in their white feathers dwell in the sacred shrines of pilgrimage.<br>
  They tear apart and eat the living beings, and so they are not called white. ||3||<br>
  My body is like the simmal tree; seeing me, other people are fooled.<br>
  Its fruits are useless - just like the qualities of my body. ||4||<br>
  The blind man is carrying such a heavy load, and his journey through the mountains is so long.<br>
  My eyes can see, but I cannot find the Way. How can I climb up and cross over the mountain? ||5||<br>
  What good does it do to serve, and be good, and be clever?<br>
  O Nanak, contemplate the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and you shall be released from bondage. ||6||1||3||<br>
  Soohee, First Mehl:<br>
  Build the raft of meditation and self-discipline, to carry you across the river.<br>
  There will be no ocean, and no rising tides to stop you; this is how comfortable your path shall be. ||1||<br>
  Your Name alone is the color, in which the robe of my body is dyed. This color is permanent, O my Beloved. ||1||Pause||<br>
  My beloved friends have departed; how will they meet the Lord?<br>
  If they have virtue in their pack, the Lord will unite them with Himself. ||2||<br>
  Once united with Him, they will not be separated again, if they are truly united.<br>
  The True Lord brings their comings and goings to an end. ||3||<br>
  One who subdues and eradicates egotism, sews the robe of devotion.<br>
  Following the Word of the Guru's Teachings, she receives the fruits of her reward, the Ambrosial Words of the Lord. ||4||<br>
  Says Nanak, O soul-brides, our Husband Lord is so dear!<br>
  We are the servants, the hand-maidens of the Lord; He is our True Lord and Master. ||5||2||4||<br>
  Soohee, First Mehl:<br>
  Those whose minds are filled with love of the Lord, are blessed and exalted.<br>
  They are blessed with peace, and their pains are forgotten.<br>
  He will undoubtedly, certainly save them. ||1||<br>
  The Guru comes to meet those whose destiny is so pre-ordained.<br>
  He blesses them with the Teachings of the Ambrosial Name of the Lord.<br>
  Those who walk in the Will of the True Guru, never wander begging. ||2||<br>
  And one who lives in the Mansion of the Lord's Presence, why should he bow down to any other?<br>
  The gate-keeper at the Lord's Gate shall not stop him to ask any questions.<br>
  And one who is blessed with the Lord's Glance of Grace - by his words, others are emancipated as well. ||3||<br>
  The Lord Himself sends out, and recalls the mortal beings; no one else gives Him advice.<br>
  He Himself demolishes, constructs and creates; He knows everything.<br>
  O Nanak, the Naam, the Name of the Lord is the blessing, given to those who receive His Mercy, and His Grace. ||4||3||5||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 19 - Raag Soohee - Part 003</h2></center>
  Soohee, First Mehl:<br>
  That vessel alone is pure, which is pleasing to Him.<br>
  The filthiest vessel does not become pure, simply by being washed.<br>
  Through the Gurdwara, the Guru's Gate, one obtains understanding.<br>
  By being washed through this Gate, it becomes pure.<br>
  The Lord Himself sets the standards to differentiate between the dirty and the pure.<br>
  Do not think that you will automatically find a place of rest hereafter.<br>
  According to the actions one has committed, so does the mortal become.<br>
  He Himself bestows the Ambrosial Name of the Lord.<br>
  Such a mortal departs with honor and renown; his life is embellished and redeemed, and the trumpets resound with his glory.<br>
  Why speak of poor mortals? His glory shall echo throughout the three worlds.<br>
  O Nanak, he himself shall be enraptured, and he shall save his entire ancestry. ||1||4||6||<br>
  Soohee, First Mehl:<br>
  The Yogi practices yoga, and the pleasure-seeker practices eating.<br>
  The austere practice austerities, bathing and rubbing themselves at sacred shrines of pilgrimage. ||1||<br>
  Let me hear some news of You, O Beloved; if only someone would come and sit with me, and tell me. ||1||Pause||<br>
  As one plants, so does he harvest; whatever he earns, he eats.<br>
  In the world hereafter, his account is not called for, if he goes with the insignia of the Lord. ||2||<br>
  According to the actions the mortal commits, so is he proclaimed.<br>
  And that breath which is drawn without thinking of the Lord, that breath goes in vain. ||3||<br>
  I would sell this body, if someone would only purchase it.<br>
  O Nanak, that body is of no use at all, if it does not enshrine the Name of the True Lord. ||4||5||7||<br>
  Soohee, First Mehl, Seventh House:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Yoga is not the patched coat, Yoga is not the walking stick. Yoga is not smearing the body with ashes.<br>
  Yoga is not the ear-rings, and not the shaven head. Yoga is not the blowing of the horn.<br>
  Remaining unblemished in the midst of the filth of the world - this is the way to attain Yoga. ||1||<br>
  By mere words, Yoga is not attained.<br>
  One who looks upon all with a single eye, and knows them to be one and the same - he alone is known as a Yogi. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Yoga is not wandering to the tombs of the dead; Yoga is not sitting in trances.<br>
  Yoga is not wandering through foreign lands; Yoga is not bathing at sacred shrines of pilgrimage.<br>
  Remaining unblemished in the midst of the filth of the world - this is the way to attain Yoga. ||2||<br>
  Meeting with the True Guru, doubt is dispelled, and the wandering mind is restrained.<br>
  Nectar rains down, celestial music resounds, and deep within, wisdom is obtained.<br>
  Remaining unblemished in the midst of the filth of the world - this is the way to attain Yoga. ||3||<br>
  O Nanak, remain dead while yet alive - practice such a Yoga.<br>
  When the horn is blown without being blown, then you shall attain the state of fearless dignity.<br>
  Remaining unblemished in the midst of the filth of the world - this is the way to attain Yoga. ||4||1||8||<br>
  Soohee, First Mehl:<br>
  What scale, what weights, and what assayer shall I call for You, Lord?<br>
  From what guru should I receive instruction? By whom should I have Your value appraised? ||1||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 19 - Raag Soohee - Part 004</h2></center>
  O my Dear Beloved Lord, Your limits are not known.<br>
  You pervade the water, the land, and the sky; You Yourself are All-pervading. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Mind is the scale, consciousness the weights, and the performance of Your service is the appraiser.<br>
  Deep within my heart, I weigh my Husband Lord; in this way I focus my consciousness. ||2||<br>
  You Yourself are the balance, the weights and the scale; You Yourself are the weigher.<br>
  You Yourself see, and You Yourself understand; You Yourself are the trader. ||3||<br>
  The blind, low class wandering soul, comes for a moment, and departs in an instant.<br>
  In its company, Nanak dwells; how can the fool attain the Lord? ||4||2||9||<br>
  Raag Soohee, Fourth Mehl, First House:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  My mind worships and adores the Lord's Name, through the Guru, and the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<br>
  All the desires of my mind and body have been fulfilled; all fear of death has been dispelled. ||1||<br>
  O my mind, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord's Name.<br>
  And when the Guru is pleased and satisfied, the mind is instructed; it then joyfully drinks in the subtle essence of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The Sat Sangat, the True Congregation of the True Guru, is sublime and exalted. They sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord God.<br>
  Bless me with Your Mercy, Lord, and unite me with the Sat Sangat; I wash the feet of Your humble servants. ||2||<br>
  The Lord's Name is all. The Lord's Name is the essence of the Guru's Teachings, the juice, the sweetness of it.<br>
  I have found the Ambrosial Nectar, the Divine Water of the Lord's Name, and all my thirst for it is quenched. ||3||<br>
  The Guru, the True Guru, is my social status and honor; I have sold my head to the Guru.<br>
  Servant Nanak is called the chaylaa, the disciple of the Guru; O Guru, save the honor of Your servant. ||4||1||<br>
  Soohee, Fourth Mehl:<br>
  I chant and vibrate the Name of the Lord God, the Supreme Being, Har, Har; my poverty and problems have all been eradicated.<br>
  The fear of birth and death has been erased, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad; serving the Unmoving, Unchanging Lord, I am absorbed in peace. ||1||<br>
  O my mind, vibrate the Name of the most Beloved, Darling Lord.<br>
  I have dedicated my mind and body, and placed them in offering before the Guru; I have sold my head to the Guru, for a very dear price. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The kings and the rulers of men enjoy pleasures and delights, but without the Name of the Lord, death seizes and dispatches them all.<br>
  The Righteous Judge of Dharma strikes them over the heads with his staff, and when the fruits of their actions come into their hands, then they regret and repent. ||2||<br>
  Save me, save me, Lord; I am Your humble servant, a mere worm. I seek the Protection of Your Sanctuary, O Primal Lord, Cherisher and Nourisher.<br>
  Please bless me with the Blessed Vision of the Saint's Darshan, that I may find peace. O God, please fulfill the desires of Your humble servant. ||3||<br>
  You are the All-powerful, Great, Primal God, my Lord and Master. O Lord, please bless me with the gift of humility.<br>
  Servant Nanak has found the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and is at peace; I am forever a sacrifice to the Naam. ||4||2||<br>
  Soohee, Fourth Mehl:<br>
  The Lord's Name is the Love of the Lord. The Lord's Love is the permanent color.<br>
  When the Guru is totally satisfied and pleased, He colors us with the Lord's Love; this color shall never fade away. ||1||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 19 - Raag Soohee - Part 005</h2></center>
  O my mind, enshrine love for the Name of the Lord.<br>
  The Guru, satisfied and pleased, taught me about the Lord, and my Sovereign Lord King met with me at once. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The self-willed manmukh is like the ignorant bride, who comes and goes again and again in reincarnation.<br>
  The Lord God does not come into her consciousness, and her mind is stuck in the love of duality. ||2||<br>
  I am full of filth, and I practice evil deeds; O Lord, save me, be with me, merge me into Your Being!<br>
  The Guru has bathed me in the pool of Ambrosial Nectar, and all my dirty sins and mistakes have been washed away. ||3||<br>
  O Lord God, Merciful to the meek and the poor, please unite me with the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation.<br>
  Joining the Sangat, servant Nanak has obtained the Lord's Love; my mind and body are drenched in it. ||4||3||<br>
  Soohee, Fourth Mehl:<br>
  One who chants the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, while constantly practicing deception, shall never become pure of heart.<br>
  He may perform all sorts of rituals, night and day, but he shall not find peace, even in dreams. ||1||<br>
  O wise ones, without the Guru, there is no devotional worship.<br>
  The untreated cloth does not take up the dye, no matter how much everyone may wish it. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The self-willed manmukh may perform chants, meditations, austere self-discipline, fasts and devotional worship, but his sickness does not go away.<br>
  Deep within him is the sickness of excessive egotism; in the love of duality he is ruined. ||2||<br>
  Outwardly, he wears religious robes and he is very clever, but his mind wanders in the ten directions.<br>
  Engrossed in ego, he does not remember the Word of the Shabad; over and over again, he is reincarnated. ||3||<br>
  O Nanak, that mortal who is blessed with the Lord's Glance of Grace, understands Him; that humble servant meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, he understands the One Lord, and is absorbed into the One Lord. ||4||4||<br>
  Soohee, Fourth Mehl, Second House:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Following the Guru's Teachings, I searched and searched the body-village;<br>
  I found the wealth of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||<br>
  The Lord, Har, Har, has enshrined peace within my mind.<br>
  The fire of desire was extinguished in an instant, when I met the Guru; all my hunger has been satisfied. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, I live, O my mother.<br>
  The Merciful True Guru implanted the Glorious Praises of the Naam within me. ||2||<br>
  I search for and seek out my Beloved Lord God, Har, Har.<br>
  Joining the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, I have obtained the subtle essence of the Lord. ||3||<br>
  By the pre-ordained destiny inscribed upon my forehead, I have found the Lord.<br>
  Guru Nanak, pleased and satisfied, has united me with the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny. ||4||1||5||<br>
  Soohee, Fourth Mehl:<br>
  Showering His Mercy, the Lord imbues the mind with His Love.<br>
  The Gurmukh merges in the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||<br>
  Imbued with the Lord's Love, the mortal enjoys the pleasure of His Love.<br>
  He remains always blissful, day and night, and he merges into the Shabad, the Word of the Perfect Guru. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Everyone longs for the Lord's Love;<br>
  the Gurmukh is imbued with the deep red color of His Love. ||2||<br>
  The foolish, self-willed manmukh is left pale and uncolored.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 19 - Raag Soohee - Part 006</h2></center>
  Even if he wishes it a hundred times, he does not obtain the Lord's Love. ||3||<br>
  But if the Lord blesses him with His Glance of Grace, then he meets the True Guru.<br>
  Nanak is absorbed into the subtle essence of the Lord's Love. ||4||2||6||<br>
  Soohee, Fourth Mehl:<br>
  My tongue remains satisfied with the subtle essence of the Lord.<br>
  The Gurmukh drinks it in, and merges in celestial peace. ||1||<br>
  If you taste the subtle essence of the Lord, O humble Siblings of Destiny,<br>
  then how can you be enticed by other flavors? ||1||Pause||<br>
  Under Guru's Instructions, keep this subtle essence enshrined in your heart.<br>
  Those who are imbued with the subtle essence of the Lord, are immersed in celestial bliss. ||2||<br>
  The self-willed manmukh cannot even taste the subtle essence of the Lord.<br>
  He acts out in ego, and suffers terrible punishment. ||3||<br>
  But if he is blessed with the Lord's Kind Mercy, then he obtains the subtle essence of the Lord.<br>
  O Nanak, absorbed in this subtle essence of the Lord, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||4||3||7||<br>
  Soohee, Fourth Mehl, Sixth House:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  When someone of low social class chants the Lord's Name, he obtains the state of highest dignity.<br>
  Go and ask Bidar, the son of a maid; Krishna himself stayed in his house. ||1||<br>
  Listen, O humble Siblings of Destiny, to the Unspoken Speech of the Lord; it removes all anxiety, pain and hunger. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Ravi Daas, the leather-worker, praised the Lord, and sang the Kirtan of His Praises each and every instant.<br>
  Although he was of low social status, he was exalted and elevated, and people of all four castes came and bowed at his feet. ||2||<br>
  Naam Dayv loved the Lord; the people called him a fabric dyer.<br>
  The Lord turned His back on the high-class Kh'shaatriyas and Brahmins, and showed His face to Naam Dayv. ||3||<br>
  All of the devotees and servants of the Lord have the tilak, the ceremonial mark, applied to their foreheads at the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage.<br>
  Servant Nanak shall touch their feet night and day, if the Lord, the King, grants His Grace. ||4||1||8||<br>
  Soohee, Fourth Mehl:<br>
  They alone worship and adore the Lord deep within, who are blessed with such pre-ordained destiny from the very beginning of time.<br>
  What can anyone do to undermine them? My Creator Lord is on their side. ||1||<br>
  So meditate on the Lord, Har, Har, O my mind. Meditate on the Lord, O mind; He is the Eliminator of all the pains of reincarnation. ||1||Pause||<br>
  In the very beginning, the Lord blessed His devotees with the Ambrosial Nectar, the treasure of devotion.<br>
  Anyone who tries to compete with them is a fool; his face shall be blackened here and hereafter. ||2||<br>
  They alone are devotees, and they alone are selfless servants, who love the Lord's Name.<br>
  By their selfless service, they find the Lord, while ashes fall on the heads of the slanderers. ||3||<br>
  He alone knows this, who experiences it within the home of his own self. Ask Guru Nanak, the Guru of the world, and reflect upon it.<br>
  Throughout the four generations of the Gurus, from the beginning of time and throughout the ages, no one has ever found the Lord by back-biting and undermining. Only by serving the Lord with love, is one emancipated. ||4||2||9||<br>
  Soohee, Fourth Mehl:<br>
  Wherever the Lord is worshipped in adoration, there the Lord becomes one's friend and helper.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 19 - Raag Soohee - Part 007</h2></center>
  By Guru's Grace, the Lord comes to dwell in the mind; He cannot be obtained in any other way. ||1||<br>
  So gather in the wealth of the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny,<br>
  so that in this world and the next, the Lord shall be your friend and companion. ||1||Pause||<br>
  In the company of the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, you shall earn the wealth of the Lord; this wealth of the Lord is not obtained anywhere else, by any other means, at all.<br>
  The dealer in the Lord's Jewels purchases the wealth of the Lord's jewels; the dealer in cheap glass jewels cannot acquire the Lord's wealth by empty words. ||2||<br>
  The Lord's wealth is like jewels, gems and rubies. At the appointed time in the Amrit Vaylaa, the ambrosial hours of the morning, the Lord's devotees lovingly center their attention on the Lord, and the wealth of the Lord.<br>
  The devotees of the Lord plant the seed of the Lord's wealth in the ambrosial hours of the Amrit Vaylaa; they eat it, and spend it, but it is never exhausted.<br>
  In this world and the next, the devotees are blessed with glorious greatness, the wealth of the Lord. ||3||<br>
  The wealth of the Fearless Lord is permanent, forever and ever, and true. This wealth of the Lord cannot be destroyed by fire or water; neither thieves nor the Messenger of Death can take it away.<br>
  Thieves cannot even approach the Lord's wealth; Death, the tax collector cannot tax it. ||4||<br>
  The faithless cynics commit sins and gather in their poisonous wealth, but it shall not go along with them for even a single step.<br>
  In this world, the faithless cynics become miserable, as it slips away through their hands. In the world hereafter, the faithless cynics find no shelter in the Court of the Lord. ||5||<br>
  The Lord Himself is the Banker of this wealth, O Saints; when the Lord gives it, the mortal loads it and takes it away.<br>
  This wealth of the Lord is never exhausted; the Guru has given this understanding to servant Nanak. ||6||3||10||<br>
  Soohee, Fourth Mehl:<br>
  That mortal, with whom the Lord is pleased, repeats the Glorious Praises of the Lord; he alone is a devotee, and he alone is approved.<br>
  How can his glory be described? Within his heart, the Primal Lord, the Lord God, abides. ||1||<br>
  Sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe; focus your meditation on the True Guru. ||1||Pause||<br>
  He is the True Guru - service to the True Guru is fruitful and rewarding. By this service, the greatest treasure is obtained.<br>
  The faithless cynics in their love of duality and sensual desires, harbor foul-smelling urges. They are totally useless and ignorant. ||2||<br>
  One who has faith - his singing is approved. He is honored in the Court of the Lord.<br>
  Those who lack faith may close their eyes, hypocritically pretending and faking devotion, but their false pretenses shall soon wear off. ||3||<br>
  My soul and body are totally Yours, Lord; You are the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, my Primal Lord God.<br>
  So speaks servant Nanak, the slave of Your slaves; as You make me speak, so do I speak. ||4||4||11||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 19 - Raag Soohee - Part 008</h2></center>
  Soohee, Fourth Mehl, Seventh House:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Which, which of Your Glorious Virtues should I sing and recount, Lord? You are my Lord and Master, the treasure of excellence.<br>
  I cannot express Your Glorious Praises. You are my Lord and Master, lofty and benevolent. ||1||<br>
  The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is my only support.<br>
  If it pleases You, please save me, O my Lord and Master; without You, I have no other at all. ||1||Pause||<br>
  You alone are my strength, and my Court, O my Lord and Master; unto You alone I pray.<br>
  There is no other place where I can offer my prayers; I can tell my pains and pleasures only to You. ||2||<br>
  Water is locked up in the earth, and fire is locked up in wood.<br>
  The sheep and the lions are kept in one place; O mortal, meditate on the Lord, and your doubts and fears shall be removed. ||3||<br>
  So behold the glorious greatness of the Lord, O Saints; the Lord blesses the dishonored with honor.<br>
  As dust rises from underfoot, O Nanak, so does the Lord make all people fall at the feet of the Holy. ||4||1||12||<br>
  Soohee, Fourth Mehl:<br>
  You Yourself, O Creator, know everything; what can I possibly tell You?<br>
  You know all the bad and the good; as we act, so are we rewarded. ||1||<br>
  O my Lord and Master, You alone know the state of my inner being.<br>
  You know all the bad and the good; as it pleases You, so You make us speak. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The Lord has infused the love of Maya into all bodies; through this human body, there comes the opportunity to worship the Lord with devotion.<br>
  You unite some with the True Guru, and bless them with peace; while others, the self-willed manmukhs, are engrossed in worldly affairs. ||2||<br>
  All belong to You, and You belong to all, O my Creator Lord; You wrote the words of destiny on the forehead of everyone.<br>
  As You bestow Your Glance of Grace, so are mortals made; without Your Gracious Glance, no one assumes any form. ||3||<br>
  You alone know Your Glorious Greatness; everyone constantly meditates on You.<br>
  That being, with whom You are pleased, is united with You; O servant Nanak, only such a mortal is accepted. ||4||2||13||<br>
  Soohee, Fourth Mehl:<br>
  Those beings, within whose inner selves my Lord, Har, Har, dwells - all their diseases are cured.<br>
  They alone become liberated, who meditate on the Name of the Lord; they obtain the supreme status. ||1||<br>
  O my Lord, the Lord's humble servants become healthy.<br>
  Those who meditate on my Lord, Har, Har, through the Word of the Guru's Teachings, are rid of the disease of ego. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva suffer from the disease of the three gunas - the three qualities; they do their deeds in egotism.<br>
  The poor fools do not remember the One who created them; this understanding of the Lord is only obtained by those who become Gurmukh. ||2||<br>
  The entire world is afflicted by the disease of egotism. They suffer the terrible pains of birth and death.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 19 - Raag Soohee - Part 009</h2></center>
  By Guru's Grace, a few rare ones are saved; I am a sacrifice to those humble beings. ||3||<br>
  The One who created the Universe, that Lord alone knows. His beauty is incomparable.<br>
  O Nanak, the Lord Himself gazes upon it, and is pleased. The Gurmukh contemplates God. ||4||3||14||<br>
  Soohee, Fourth Mehl:<br>
  All that happens, and all that will happen, is by His Will. If we could do something by ourselves, we would.<br>
  By ourselves, we cannot do anything at all. As it pleases the Lord, He preserves us. ||1||<br>
  O my Dear Lord, everything is in Your power.<br>
  I have no power to do anything at all. As it pleases You, You forgive us. ||1||Pause||<br>
  You Yourself bless us with soul, body and everything. You Yourself cause us to act.<br>
  As You issue Your Commands, so do we act, according to our pre-ordained destiny. ||2||<br>
  You created the entire Universe out of the five elements; if anyone can create a sixth, let him.<br>
  You unite some with the True Guru, and cause them to understand, while others, the self-willed manmukhs, do their deeds and cry out in pain. ||3||<br>
  I cannot describe the glorious greatness of the Lord; I am foolish, thoughtless, idiotic and lowly.<br>
  Please, forgive servant Nanak, O my Lord and Master; I am ignorant, but I have entered Your Sanctuary. ||4||4||15||24||<br>
  Raag Soohee, Fifth Mehl, First House:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  The actor stages the play,<br>
  playing the many characters in different costumes;<br>
  but when the play ends, he takes off the costumes,<br>
  and then he is one, and only one. ||1||<br>
  How many forms and images appeared and disappeared?<br>
  Where have they gone? Where did they come from? ||1||Pause||<br>
  Countless waves rise up from the water.<br>
  Jewels and ornaments of many different forms are fashioned from gold.<br>
  I have seen seeds of all kinds being planted<br>
  - when the fruit ripens, the seeds appear in the same form as the original. ||2||<br>
  The one sky is reflected in thousands of water jugs,<br>
  but when the jugs are broken, only the sky remains.<br>
  Doubt comes from greed, emotional attachment and the corruption of Maya.<br>
  Freed from doubt, one realizes the One Lord alone. ||3||<br>
  He is imperishable; He will never pass away.<br>
  He does not come, and He does not go.<br>
  The Perfect Guru has washed away the filth of ego.<br>
  Says Nanak, I have obtained the supreme status. ||4||1||<br>
  Soohee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Whatever God wills, that alone happens.<br>
  Without You, there is no other at all.<br>
  The humble being serves Him, and so all his works are perfectly successful.<br>
  O Lord, please preserve the honor of Your slaves. ||1||<br>
  I seek Your Sanctuary, O Perfect, Merciful Lord.<br>
  Without You, who would cherish and love me? ||1||Pause||<br>
  He is permeating and pervading the water, the land and the sky.<br>
  God dwells near at hand; He is not far away.<br>
  By trying to please other people, nothing is accomplished.<br>
  When someone is attached to the True Lord, his ego is taken away. ||2||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 19 - Raag Soohee - Part 010</h2></center>
  He alone is attached, whom the Lord Himself attaches.<br>
  The jewel of spiritual wisdom is awakened deep within.<br>
  Evil-mindedness is eradicated, and the supreme status is attained.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||3||<br>
  Pressing my palms together, I offer my prayer;<br>
  if it pleases You, Lord, please bless me and fulfill me.<br>
  Grant Your Mercy, Lord, and bless me with devotion.<br>
  Servant Nanak meditates on God forever. ||4||2||<br>
  Soohee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Blessed is that soul-bride, who realizes God.<br>
  She obeys the Hukam of His Order, and abandons her self-conceit.<br>
  Imbued with her Beloved, she celebrates in delight. ||1||<br>
  Listen, O my companions - these are the signs on the Path to meet God.<br>
  Dedicate your mind and body to Him; stop living to please others. ||1||Pause||<br>
  One soul-bride counsels another,<br>
  to do only that which pleases God.<br>
  Such a soul-bride merges into the Being of God. ||2||<br>
  One who is in the grip of pride does not obtain the Mansion of the Lord's Presence.<br>
  She regrets and repents, when her life-night passes away.<br>
  The unfortunate self-willed manmukhs suffer in pain. ||3||<br>
  I pray to God, but I think that He is far away.<br>
  God is imperishable and eternal; He is pervading and permeating everywhere.<br>
  Servant Nanak sings of Him; I see Him Ever-present everywhere. ||4||3||<br>
  Soohee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  The Giver has put this household of my being under my own control. I am now the mistress of the Lord's Home.<br>
  My Husband Lord has made the ten senses and organs of actions my slaves.<br>
  I have gathered together all the faculties and facilities of this house.<br>
  I am thirsty with desire and longing for my Husband Lord. ||1||<br>
  What Glorious Virtues of my Beloved Husband Lord should I describe?<br>
  He is All-knowing, totally beautiful and merciful; He is the Destroyer of ego. ||1||Pause||<br>
  I am adorned with Truth, and I have applied the mascara of the Fear of God to my eyes.<br>
  I have chewed the betel-leaf of the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord.<br>
  My bracelets, robes and ornaments beautifully adorn me.<br>
  The soul-bride becomes totally happy, when her Husband Lord comes to her home. ||2||<br>
  By the charms of virtue, I have enticed and fascinated my Husband Lord.<br>
  He is under my power - the Guru has dispelled my doubts.<br>
  My mansion is lofty and elevated.<br>
  Renouncing all other brides, my Beloved has become my lover. ||3||<br>
  The sun has risen, and its light shines brightly.<br>
  I have prepared my bed with infinite care and faith.<br>
  My Darling Beloved is new and fresh; He has come to my bed to enjoy me.<br>
  O Servant Nanak, my Husband Lord has come; the soul-bride has found peace. ||4||4||<br>
  Soohee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  An intense yearning to meet God has welled up in my heart.<br>
  I have gone out searching to find my Beloved Husband Lord.<br>
  Hearing news of my Beloved, I have laid out my bed in my home.<br>
  Wandering, wandering all around, I came, but I did not even see Him. ||1||<br>
  How can this poor heart be comforted?<br>
  Come and meet me, O Friend; I am a sacrifice to You. ||1||Pause||<br>
  One bed is spread out for the bride and her Husband Lord.<br>
  The bride is asleep, while her Husband Lord is always awake.<br>
  The bride is intoxicated, as if she has drunk wine.<br>
  The soul-bride only awakens when her Husband Lord calls to her. ||2||<br>
  She has lost hope - so many days have passed.<br>
  I have travelled through all the lands and the countries.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 19 - Raag Soohee - Part 011</h2></center>
  I cannot survive, even for an instant, without the feet of my Beloved.<br>
  When God becomes Merciful, I become fortunate, and then I meet Him. ||3||<br>
  Becoming Merciful, He has united me with the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation.<br>
  The fire has been quenched, and I have found my Husband Lord within my own home.<br>
  I am now adorned with all sorts of decorations.<br>
  Says Nanak, the Guru has dispelled my doubt. ||4||<br>
  Wherever I look, I see my Husband Lord there, O Siblings of Destiny.<br>
  When the door is opened, then the mind is restrained. ||1||Second Pause||5||<br>
  Soohee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  What virtues and excellences of Yours should I cherish and contemplate? I am worthless, while You are the Great Giver.<br>
  I am Your slave - what clever tricks could I ever try? This soul and body are totally Yours||1||<br>
  O my Darling, Blissful Beloved, who fascinates my mind - I am a sacrifice to the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. ||1||Pause||<br>
  O God, You are the Great Giver, and I am just a poor beggar; You are forever and ever benevolent.<br>
  I cannot accomplish anything by myself, O my Unapproachable and Infinite Lord and Master. ||2||<br>
  What service can I perform? What should I say to please You? How can I gain the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan?<br>
  Your extent cannot be found - Your limits cannot be found. My mind longs for Your Feet. ||3||<br>
  I beg with persistence to receive this gift, that the dust of the Saints might touch my face.<br>
  The Guru has showered His Mercy upon servant Nanak; reaching out with His Hand, God has delivered him. ||4||6||<br>
  Soohee, Fifth Mehl, Third House:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  His service is insignificant, but his demands are very great.<br>
  He does not obtain the Mansion of the Lord's Presence, but he says that he has arrived there||1||<br>
  He competes with those who have been accepted by the Beloved Lord.<br>
  This is how stubborn the false fool is! ||1||Pause||<br>
  He wears religious robes, but he does not practice Truth.<br>
  He says that he has found the Mansion of the Lord's Presence, but he cannot even get near it. ||2||<br>
  He says that he is unattached, but he is intoxicated with Maya.<br>
  There is no love in his mind, and yet he says that he is imbued with the Lord. ||3||<br>
  Says Nanak, hear my prayer, God:<br>
  I am silly, stubborn and filled with sexual desire - please, liberate me! ||4||<br>
  I gaze upon the glorious greatness of the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan.<br>
  You are the Giver of Peace, the Loving Primal Being. ||1||Second Pause||1||7||<br>
  Soohee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  He gets up early, to do his evil deeds,<br>
  but when it is time to meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, then he sleeps. ||1||<br>
  The ignorant person does not take advantage of the opportunity.<br>
  He is attached to Maya, and engrossed in worldly delights. ||1||Pause||<br>
  He rides the waves of greed, puffed up with joy.<br>
  He does not see the Blessed Vision of the Darshan of the Holy. ||2||<br>
  The ignorant clown will never understand.<br>
  Again and again, he becomes engrossed in entanglements. ||1||Pause||<br>
  He listens to the sounds of sin and the music of corruption, and he is pleased.<br>
  His mind is too lazy to listen to the Praises of the Lord. ||3||<br>
  You do not see with your eyes - you are so blind!<br>
  You shall have to leave all these false affairs. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Says Nanak, please forgive me, God.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 19 - Raag Soohee - Part 012</h2></center>
  Have Mercy upon me, and bless me with the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||4||<br>
  He alone obtains something, who becomes the dust under the feet of all.<br>
  And he alone repeats the Naam, whom God causes to understand. ||1||Pause||2||8||<br>
  Soohee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Within the home of his own self, he does not even come to see his Lord and Master.<br>
  And yet, around his neck, he hangs a stone god. ||1||<br>
  The faithless cynic wanders around, deluded by doubt.<br>
  He churns water, and after wasting his life away, he dies. ||1||Pause||<br>
  That stone, which he calls his god,<br>
  that stone pulls him down and drowns him. ||2||<br>
  O sinner, you are untrue to your own self;<br>
  a boat of stone will not carry you across. ||3||<br>
  Meeting the Guru, O Nanak, I know my Lord and Master.<br>
  The Perfect Architect of Destiny is pervading and permeating the water, the land and the sky. ||4||3||9||<br>
  Soohee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  How have you enjoyed your Dear Beloved?<br>
  O sister, please teach me, please show me. ||1||<br>
  Crimson, crimson, crimson - this is the color of the soul-bride who is imbued with the Love of her Beloved. ||1||Pause||<br>
  I wash Your Feet with my eye-lashes.<br>
  Wherever You send me, there I will go. ||2||<br>
  I would trade meditation, austerity, self-discipline and celibacy,<br>
  if I could only meet the Lord of my life, for even an instant. ||3||<br>
  She who eradicates her self-conceit, power and arrogant intellect,<br>
  O Nanak, is the true soul-bride. ||4||4||10||<br>
  Soohee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  You are my Life, the very Support of my breath of life.<br>
  Gazing upon You, beholding You, my mind is soothed and comforted. ||1||<br>
  You are my Friend, You are my Beloved.<br>
  I shall never forget You. ||1||Pause||<br>
  I am Your indentured servant; I am Your slave.<br>
  You are my Great Lord and Master, the treasure of excellence. ||2||<br>
  There are millions of servants in Your Court - Your Royal Darbaar.<br>
  Each and every instant, You dwell with them. ||3||<br>
  I am nothing; everything is Yours.<br>
  Through and through, You abide with Nanak. ||4||5||11||<br>
  Soohee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  His Mansions are so comfortable, and His gates are so lofty.<br>
  Within them, His beloved devotees dwell. ||1||<br>
  The Natural Speech of God is so very sweet.<br>
  How rare is that person, who sees it with his eyes. ||1||Pause||<br>
  There, in the arena of the congregation, the divine music of the Naad, the sound current, is sung.<br>
  There, the Saints celebrate with their Lord. ||2||<br>
  Neither birth nor death is there, neither pain nor pleasure.<br>
  The Ambrosial Nectar of the True Name rains down there. ||3||<br>
  From the Guru, I have come to know the mystery of this speech.<br>
  Nanak speaks the Bani of the Lord, Har, Har. ||4||6||12||<br>
  Soohee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  By the Blessed Vision of their Darshan, millions of sins are erased.<br>
  Meeting with them, this terrifying world-ocean is crossed over||1||<br>
  They are my companions, and they are my dear friends,<br>
  who inspire me to remember the Lord's Name. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Hearing the Word of His Shabad, I am totally at peace.<br>
  When I serve Him, the Messenger of Death is chased away. ||2||<br>
  His comfort and consolation soothes and supports my mind.<br>
  Remembering Him in meditation, my face is radiant and bright. ||3||<br>
  God embellishes and supports His servants.<br>
  Nanak seeks the Protection of their Sanctuary; he is forever a sacrifice to them. ||4||7||13||<br>

  Soohee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  The angelic beings and demi-gods are not permitted to remain here.<br>
  The silent sages and humble servants also must arise and depart. ||1||<br>
  Only those who meditate on the Lord, Har, Har, are seen to live on.<br>
  In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, they obtain the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Kings, emperors and merchants must die.<br>
  Whoever is seen shall be consumed by death. ||2||<br>
  Mortal beings are entangled, clinging to false worldly attachments.<br>
  And when they must leave them behind, then they regret and grieve. ||3||<br>
  O Lord, O treasure of mercy, please bless Nanak with this gift,<br>
  that he may chant Your Name, day and night. ||4||8||14||<br>

  You dwell deep within the heart of each and every being.<br>
  The entire universe is strung on Your Thread. ||1||<br>
  You are my Beloved, the Support of my breath of life.<br>
  Beholding You, gazing upon You, my mind blossoms forth. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Wandering, wandering, wandering through countless incarnations, I have grown so weary.<br>
  Now, I hold tight to the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||2||<br>
  You are inaccessible, incomprehensible, invisible and infinite.<br>
  Nanak remembers You in meditation, day and night. ||3||9||15||<br>
  Soohee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  What is the use of the glory of Maya?<br>
  It disappears in no time at all. ||1||<br>
  This is a dream, but the sleeper does not know it.<br>
  In his unconscious state, he clings to it. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The poor fool is enticed by the great attachments of the world.<br>
  Gazing upon them, watching them, he must still arise and depart. ||2||<br>
  The Royal Court of His Darbaar is the highest of the high.<br>
  He creates and destroys countless beings. ||3||<br>
  There has never been any other, and there shall never be.<br>
  O Nanak, meditate on the One God. ||4||10||16||<br>

  I wash Your Lotus Feet, and drink in the wash water. ||1||<br>
  He is my Lord, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.<br>
  My Lord and Master abides with His humble devotees. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Hearing, hearing Your Ambrosial Naam, I meditate on it.<br>
  Twenty-four hours a day, I sing Your Glorious Praises. ||2||<br>
  Beholding, beholding Your divine play, my mind is in bliss.<br>
  Your Glorious Virtues are infinite, O God, O Lord of supreme bliss. ||3||<br>

  The image of His vision is fruitful; I am a sacrifice to it.<br>
  His Lotus Feet are the Support of the mind, the Support of the very breath of life. ||1||Pause||<br>
  In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the cycle of birth and death is ended.<br>
  To hear the Ambrosial Sermon is the support of my ears. ||2||<br>
  I have renounced sexual desire, anger, greed and emotional attachment.<br>
  I have enshrined the Naam within myself, with charity, true cleansing and righteous conduct. ||3||<br>
  Says Nanak, I have contemplated this essence of reality;<br>
  chanting the Name of the Lord, I am carried across. ||4||12||18||<br>

  O God, You are the Great Giver, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.<br>
  The body of the egotistical human is perishable. ||2||<br>
  Tastes and pleasures, conflicts and jealousy, and intoxication with Maya<br>

  Do only those deeds which will save you, O mortal being.<br>
  Chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, and the Ambrosial Word of His Bani. ||1||Pause||<br>
  You are forever imbued with the love of horses and mansions.<br>
  Nothing shall go along with you. ||2||<br>
  You may clean and decorate the vessel of clay,<br>
  but it is so very filthy; it shall receive its punishment from the Messenger of Death. ||3||<br>

  but you do not experience the state of victory of the Lord of the Universe. ||3||<br>
  So enter the Sanctuary of the All-powerful, Unfathomable Lord and Master.<br>
  O God, O Searcher of hearts, please, save Nanak! ||4||27||33||<br>
  Soohee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Cross over the terrifying world-ocean in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.<br>
  Remember in meditation the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, the source of jewels. ||1||<br>
  Remembering, remembering the Lord in meditation, I live.<br>
  All pain, disease and suffering is dispelled, meeting the Perfect Guru; sin has been eradicated. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The immortal status is obtained through the Name of the Lord;<br>
  the mind and body become spotless and pure, which is the true purpose of life. ||2||<br>
  Twenty-four hours a day, meditate on the Supreme Lord God.<br>
  By pre-ordained destiny, the Name is obtained. ||3||<br>
  I have entered His Sanctuary, and I meditate on the Lord, Merciful to the meek.<br>
  Nanak longs for the dust of the Saints. ||4||28||34||<br>
  Soohee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  The beautiful one does not know the work of his own home.<br>
  The fool is engrossed in false attachments. ||1||<br>
  As You attach us, so we are attached.<br>
  When You bless us with Your Name, we chant it. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The Lord's slaves are imbued with the Love of the Lord.<br>
  They are intoxicated with the Lord, night and day. ||2||<br>
  Reaching out to grasp hold of our arms, God lifts us up.<br>
  Separated for countless incarnations, we are united with Him again. ||3||<br>
  Save me, O God, O my Lord and Master - shower me with Your Mercy.<br>
  Slave Nanak seeks Sanctuary at Your Door, O Lord. ||4||29||35||<br>
  Soohee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  By the Grace of the Saints, I have found my eternal home.<br>
  I have found total peace, and I shall not waver again. ||1||<br>
  I meditate on the Guru, and the Lord's Feet, within my mind.<br>
  In this way, the Creator Lord has made me steady and stable. ||1||Pause||<br>
  I sing the Glorious Praises of the unchanging, eternal Lord God,<br>
  and the noose of death is snapped. ||2||<br>
  Showering His Mercy, he has attached me to the hem of His robe.<br>
  In constant bliss, Nanak sings His Glorious Praises. ||3||30||36||<br>
  Soohee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  The Words, the Teachings of the Holy Saints, are Ambrosial Nectar.<br>
  Whoever meditates on the Lord's Name is emancipated; he chants the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, with his tongue. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The pains and sufferings of the Dark Age of Kali Yuga are eradicated,<br>
  when the One Name abides within the mind. ||1||<br>
  I apply the dust of the feet of the Holy to my face and forehead.<br>
  Nanak has been saved, in the Sanctuary of the Guru, the Lord. ||2||31||37||<br>
  Soohee, Fifth Mehl: Third House:<br>
  I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe, the Merciful Lord.<br>
  Please, bless me with the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, O Perfect, Compassionate Lord. ||Pause||<br>
  Please, grant Your Grace, and cherish me.<br>
  My soul and body are all Your property. ||1||<br>
  Only meditation on the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord, will go along with you.<br>
  Nanak begs for the dust of the Saints. ||2||32||38||<br>
  Soohee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Without Him, there is no other at all.<br>
  The True Lord Himself is our anchor. ||1||<br>
  The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is our only support.<br>
  The Creator, the Cause of causes, is All-powerful and Infinite. ||1||Pause||<br>
  He has eradicated all illness, and healed me.<br>
  O Nanak, He Himself has become my Savior. ||2||33||39||<br>

  Soohee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Everyone longs for the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan.<br>
  By perfect destiny, it is obtained. ||Pause||<br>
  Forsaking the Beautiful Lord, how can they go to sleep?<br>
  The great enticer Maya has led them down the path of sin. ||1||<br>
  This butcher has separated them from the Beloved Lord.<br>
  This merciless one shows no mercy at all to the poor beings. ||2||<br>
  Countless lifetimes have passed away, wandering aimlessly.<br>
  The terrible, treacherous Maya does not even allow them to dwell in their own home. ||3||<br>
  Day and night, they receive the rewards of their own actions.<br>
  Don't blame anyone else; your own actions lead you astray. ||4||<br>
  Listen, O Friend, O Saint, O humble Sibling of Destiny:<br>
  in the Sanctuary of the Lord's Feet, Nanak has found Salvation. ||5||34||40||<br>
  Raag Soohee, Fifth Mehl, Fourth House:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Even a crude hut is sublime and beautiful, if the Lord's Praises are sung within it.<br>
  Those mansions where the Lord is forgotten are useless. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Even poverty is bliss, if God comes to mind in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.<br>
  This worldly glory might just as well burn; it only traps the mortals in Maya. ||1||<br>
  One may have to grind corn, and wear a coarse blanket, but still, one can find peace of mind and contentment.<br>
  Even empires are of no use at all, if they do not bring satisfaction. ||2||<br>
  Someone may wander around naked, but if he loves the One Lord, he receives honor and respect.<br>
  Silk and satin clothes are worthless, if they lead to greed. ||3||<br>
  Everything is in Your Hands, God. You Yourself are the Doer, the Cause of causes.<br>
  With each and every breath, may I continue to remember You. Please, bless Nanak with this gift. ||4||1||41||<br>
  Soohee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  The Lord's Saint is my life and wealth. I am his water-carrier.<br>
  He is dearer to me than all my siblings, friends and children. ||1||Pause||<br>
  I make my hair into a fan, and wave it over the Saint.<br>
  I bow my head low, to touch his feet, and apply his dust to my face. ||1||<br>
  I offer my prayer with sweet words, in sincere humility.<br>
  Renouncing egotism, I enter His Sanctuary. I have found the Lord, the treasure of virtue. ||2||<br>
  I gaze upon the Blessed Vision of the Lord's humble servant, again and again.<br>
  I cherish and gather in His Ambrosial Words within my mind; time and time again, I bow to Him. ||3||<br>
  In my mind, I wish, hope and beg for the Society of the Lord's humble servants.<br>
  Be Merciful to Nanak, O God, and lead him to the feet of Your slaves. ||4||2||42||<br>
  Soohee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  She has enticed the worlds and solar systems; I have fallen into her clutches.<br>
  O Lord, please save this corrupt soul of mine; please bless me with Your Name. ||1||Pause||<br>
  She has not brought anyone peace, but still, I chase after her.<br>
  She forsakes everyone, but still, I cling to her, again and again. ||1||<br>
  Have Mercy on me, O Lord of Compassion; please let me sing Your Glorious Praises, O Lord.<br>
  This is Nanak's prayer, O Lord, that he may join and merge with the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||2||3||43||<br>

  Raag Soohee, Fifth Mehl, Fifth House, Partaal:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Love of the enticing Beloved Lord is the most glorious love.<br>
  Meditate, O mind, on the One Lord of the Universe - nothing else is of any account. Attach your mind to the Saints, and abandon the path of duality. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The Lord is absolute and unmanifest; He has assumed the most sublime manifestation. He has fashioned countless body chambers of many, varied, different, myriad forms.<br>
  Within them, the mind is the policeman;<br>
  my Beloved lives in the temple of my inner self.<br>
  He plays there in ecstasy.<br>
  He does not die, and he never grows old. ||1||<br>
  He is engrossed in worldly activities, wandering around in various ways. He steals the property of others,<br>
  and is surrounded by corruption and sin.<br>
  But now, he joins the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy,<br>
  and stands before the Lord's Gate.<br>
  He obtains the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan.<br>
  Nanak has met the Guru;<br>
  he shall not be reincarnated again. ||2||1||44||<br>
  Soohee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  The Lord has made this world a stage;<br>
  He fashioned the expanse of the entire creation. ||1||Pause||<br>
  He fashioned it in various ways, with limitless colors and forms.<br>
  He watches over it with joy, and He never tires of enjoying it.<br>
  He enjoys all the delights, and yet He remains unattached. ||1||<br>
  He has no color, no sign, no mouth and no beard.<br>
  I cannot describe Your play.<br>
  Nanak is the dust of the feet of the Saints. ||2||2||45||<br>
  Soohee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  I have come to You. I have come to Your Sanctuary.<br>
  I have come to place my faith in You. I have come seeking Mercy.<br>
  If it pleases You, save me, O my Lord and Master. The Guru has placed me upon the Path. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Maya is very treacherous and difficult to pass through. It is like a violent wind-storm. ||1||<br>
  I am so afraid to hear<br>
  that the Righteous Judge of Dharma is so strict and stern. ||2||<br>
  The world is a deep, dark pit;<br>
  it is all on fire. ||3||<br>
  I have grasped the Support of the Holy Saints.<br>
  Nanak meditates on the Lord.<br>
  Now, I have found the Perfect Lord. ||4||3||46||<br>
  Raag Soohee, Fifth Mehl, Sixth House:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  I offer this prayer to the True Guru, to bless me with the sustenance of the Naam.<br>
  When the True King is pleased, the world is rid of its diseases. ||1||<br>
  You are the Support of Your devotees, and the Shelter of the Saints, O True Creator Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  True are Your devices, and True is Your Court.<br>
  True are Your treasures, and True is Your expanse. ||2||<br>
  Your Form is inaccessible, and Your Vision is incomparably beautiful.<br>
  I am a sacrifice to Your servants; they love Your Name, O Lord. ||3||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 19 - Raag Soohee - Part 020</h2></center>
  All desires are fulfilled, when the Inaccessible and Infinite Lord is obtained.<br>
  Guru Nanak has met the Supreme Lord God; I am a sacrifice to Your Feet. ||4||1||47||<br>
  Raag Soohee, Fifth Mehl, Seventh House:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  He alone obeys Your Will, O Lord, unto whom You are Merciful.<br>
  That alone is devotional worship, which is pleasing to Your Will. You are the Cherisher of all beings. ||1||<br>
  O my Sovereign Lord, You are the Support of the Saints.<br>
  Whatever pleases You, they accept. You are the sustenance of their minds and bodies. ||1||Pause||<br>
  You are kind and compassionate, the treasure of mercy, the fulfiller of our hopes.<br>
  You are the Beloved Lord of life of all Your devotees; You are the Beloved of Your devotees. ||2||<br>
  You are unfathomable, infinite, lofty and exalted. There is no one else like You.<br>
  This is my prayer, O my Lord and Master; may I never forget You, O Peace-giving Lord. ||3||<br>
  Day and night, with each and every breath, I sing Your Glorious Praises, if it is pleasing to Your Will.<br>
  Nanak begs for the peace of Your Name, O Lord and Master; as it is pleasing to Your Will, I shall attain it. ||4||1||48||<br>
  Soohee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Where is that place, where You are never forgotten, Lord?<br>
  Twenty-four hours a day, they meditate on You, and their bodies become spotless and pure. ||1||<br>
  O my Lord, I have come searching for that place.<br>
  After seeking and searching, I found Sanctuary in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Reading and reciting the Vedas, Brahma grew weary, but he did not find even a tiny bit of God's worth.<br>
  The seekers and Siddhas wander around bewailing; they too are enticed by Maya. ||2||<br>
  There were ten regal incarnations of Vishnu; and then there was Shiva, the renunciate.<br>
  He did not find Your limits either, although he grew weary of smearing his body with ashes. ||3||<br>
  Peace, poise and bliss are found in the subtle essence of the Naam. The Lord's Saints sing the songs of joy.<br>
  I have obtained the Fruitful Vision of Guru Nanak's Darshan, and with my mind and body I meditate on the Lord, Har, Har. ||4||2||49||<br>
  Soohee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  The religious rites, rituals and hypocrisies which are seen, are plundered by the Messenger of Death, the ultimate tax collector.<br>
  In the state of Nirvaanaa, sing the Kirtan of the Creator's Praises; contemplating Him in meditation, even for an instant, one is saved. ||1||<br>
  O Saints, cross over the world-ocean.<br>
  One who practices the Teachings of the Saints, by Guru's Grace, is carried across. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Millions of cleansing baths at sacred shrines of pilgrimage only fill the mortal with filth in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga.<br>
  One who sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, becomes spotlessly pure. ||2||<br>
  One may read all the books of the Vedas, the Bible, the Simritees and the Shaastras, but they will not bring liberation.<br>
  One who, as Gurmukh, chants the One Word, acquires a spotlessly pure reputation. ||3||<br>
  The four castes - the Kh'shaatriyas, Brahmins, Soodras and Vaishyas - are equal in respect to the teachings.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 19 - Raag Soohee - Part 021</h2></center>
  One who, as Gurmukh, chants the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is saved. In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, O Nanak, God is permeating the hearts of each and every being. ||4||3||50||<br>
  Soohee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Whatever God causes to happen is accepted, by those who are attuned to the Love of the Lord's Name.<br>
  Those who fall at the Feet of God are respected everywhere. ||1||<br>
  O my Lord, no one is as great as the Lord's Saints.<br>
  The devotees are in harmony with their God; He is in the water, the land, and the sky. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Millions of sinners have been saved in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; the Messenger of Death does not even approach them.<br>
  Those who have been separated from the Lord, for countless incarnations, are reunited with the Lord again. ||2||<br>
  Attachment to Maya, doubt and fear are eradicated, when one enters the Sanctuary of the Saints.<br>
  Whatever wishes one harbors, are obtained from the Saints. ||3||<br>
  How can I describe the glory of the Lord's humble servants? They are pleasing to their God.<br>
  Says Nanak, those who meet the True Guru, become independent of all obligations. ||4||4||51||<br>
  Soohee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Giving me Your Hand, You saved me from the terrible fire, when I sought Your Sanctuary.<br>
  Deep within my heart, I respect Your strength; I have abandoned all other hopes. ||1||<br>
  O my Sovereign Lord, when You enter my consciousness, I am saved.<br>
  You are my support. I count on You. Meditating on You, I am saved. ||1||Pause||<br>
  You pulled me up out of the deep, dark pit. You have become merciful to me.<br>
  You care for me, and bless me with total peace; You Yourself cherish me. ||2||<br>
  The Transcendent Lord has blessed me with His Glance of Grace; breaking my bonds, He has delivered me.<br>
  God Himself inspires me to worship Him; He Himself inspires me to serve Him. ||3||<br>
  My doubts have gone, my fears and infatuations have been dispelled, and all my sorrows are gone.<br>
  O Nanak, the Lord, the Giver of peace has been merciful to me. I have met the Perfect True Guru. ||4||5||52||<br>
  Soohee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  When nothing existed, what deeds were being done? And what karma caused anyone to be born at all?<br>
  The Lord Himself set His play in motion, and He Himself beholds it. He created the Creation. ||1||<br>
  O my Sovereign Lord, I cannot do anything at all by myself.<br>
  He Himself is the Creator, He Himself is the Cause. He is pervading deep within all. ||1||Pause||<br>
  If my account were to be judged, I would never be saved. My body is transitory and ignorant.<br>
  Take pity upon me, O Creator Lord God; Your Forgiving Grace is singular and unique. ||2||<br>
  You created all beings and creatures. Each and every heart meditates on You.<br>
  Your condition and expanse are known only to You; the value of Your creative omnipotence cannot be estimated. ||3||<br>
  I am worthless, foolish, thoughtless and ignorant. I know nothing about good actions and righteous living.<br>
  Take pity on Nanak, that he may sing Your Glorious Praises; and that Your Will may seem sweet to him. ||4||6||53||<br>
  Soohee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
 <center><h2>Section 19 - Raag Soohee - Part 022</h2></center>
  Your Saints are very fortunate; their homes are filled with the wealth of the Lord's Name.<br>
  Their birth is approved, and their actions are fruitful. ||1||<br>
  O my Lord, I am a sacrifice to the humble servants of the Lord.<br>
  I make my hair into a fan, and wave it over them; I apply the dust of their feet to my face. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Those generous, humble beings are above both birth and death.<br>
  They give the gift of the soul, and practice devotional worship; they inspire others to meet the Lord. ||2||<br>
  True are their commands, and true are their empires; they are attuned to the Truth.<br>
  True is their happiness, and true is their greatness. They know the Lord, to whom they belong. ||3||<br>
  I wave the fan over them, carry water for them, and grind corn for the humble servants of the Lord.<br>
  Nanak offers this prayer to God - please, grant me the sight of Your humble servants. ||4||7||54||<br>
  Soohee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  The True Guru is the Transcendent Lord, the Supreme Lord God; He Himself is the Creator Lord.<br>
  Your servant begs for the dust of Your feet. I am a sacrifice to the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. ||1||<br>
  O my Sovereign Lord, as You keep me, so do I remain.<br>
  When it pleases You, I chant Your Name. You alone can grant me peace. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Liberation, comfort and proper lifestyle come from serving You; You alone cause us to serve You.<br>
  That place is heaven, where the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises are sung. You Yourself instill faith into us. ||2||<br>
  Meditating, meditating, meditating in remembrance on the Naam, I live; my mind and body are enraptured.<br>
  I wash Your Lotus Feet, and drink in this water, O my True Guru, O Merciful to the meek. ||3||<br>
  I am a sacrifice to that most wonderful time when I came to Your Door.<br>
  God has become compassionate to Nanak; I have found the Perfect True Guru. ||4||8||55||<br>
  Soohee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  When You come to mind, I am totally in bliss. One who forgets You might just as well be dead.<br>
  That being, whom You bless with Your Mercy, O Creator Lord, constantly meditates on You. ||1||<br>
  O my Lord and Master, You are the honor of the dishonored such as me.<br>
  I offer my prayer to You, God; listening, listening to the Word of Your Bani, I live. ||1||Pause||<br>
  May I become the dust of the feet of Your humble servants. I am a sacrifice to the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan.<br>
  I enshrine Your Ambrosial Word within my heart. By Your Grace, I have found the Company of the Holy. ||2||<br>
  I place the state of my inner being before You; there is no other as great as You.<br>
  He alone is attached, whom You attach; he alone is Your devotee. ||3||<br>
  With my palms pressed together, I beg for this one gift; O my Lord and Master, if it pleases You, I shall obtain it.<br>
  With each and every breath, Nanak adores You; twenty-four hours a day, I sing Your Glorious Praises. ||4||9||56||<br>
  Soohee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  When You stand over our heads, O Lord and Master, how can we suffer in pain?<br>
  The mortal being does not know how to chant Your Name - he is intoxicated with the wine of Maya, and the thought of death does not even enter his mind. ||1||<br>
  O my Sovereign Lord, You belong to the Saints, and the Saints belong to You.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 19 - Raag Soohee - Part 023</h2></center>
  Your servant is not afraid of anything; the Messenger of Death cannot even approach him. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Those who are attuned to Your Love, O my Lord and Master, are released from the pains of birth and death.<br>
  No one can erase Your Blessings; the True Guru has given me this assurance. ||2||<br>
  Those who meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, obtain the fruits of peace. Twenty-four hours a day, they worship and adore You.<br>
  In Your Sanctuary, with Your Support, they subdue the five villains. ||3||<br>
  I know nothing about wisdom, meditation and good deeds; I know nothing about Your excellence.<br>
  Guru Nanak is the greatest of all; He saved my honor in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga. ||4||10||57||<br>
  Soohee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Renouncing everything, I have come to the Guru's Sanctuary; save me, O my Savior Lord!<br>
  Whatever You link me to, to that I am linked; what can this poor creature do? ||1||<br>
  O my Dear Lord God, You are the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.<br>
  Be Merciful to me, O Divine, Compassionate Guru, that I may constantly sing the Glorious Praises of my Lord and Master. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Twenty-four hours a day, I meditate on my God; by Guru's Grace, I cross over the terrifying world-ocean.<br>
  Renouncing self-conceit, I have become the dust of all men's feet; in this way, I die, while I am still alive. ||2||<br>
  How fruitful is the life of that being in this world, who chants the Name in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.<br>
  All desires are fulfilled, for the one who is blessed with God's Kindness and Mercy. ||3||<br>
  O Merciful to the meek, Kind and Compassionate Lord God, I seek Your Sanctuary.<br>
  Take pity upon me, and bless me with Your Name. Nanak is the dust of the feet of the Holy. ||4||11||58||<br>
  Raag Soohee, Ashtapadee, First Mehl, First House:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  I am totally without virtue; I have no virtue at all.<br>
  How can I meet my Husband Lord? ||1||<br>
  I have no beauty, no enticing eyes.<br>
  I do not have a noble family, good manners or a sweet voice. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The soul-bride adorns herself with peace and poise.<br>
  But she is a happy soul-bride, only if her Husband Lord is pleased with her. ||2||<br>
  He has no form or feature;<br>
  at the very last instant, he cannot suddenly be contemplated. ||3||<br>
  I have no understanding, intellect or cleverness.<br>
  Have Mercy upon me, God, and attach me to Your Feet. ||4||<br>
  She may be very clever, but this does not please her Husband Lord.<br>
  Attached to Maya, she is deluded by doubt. ||5||<br>
  But if she gets rid of her ego, then she merges in her Husband Lord.<br>
  Only then can the soul-bride obtain the nine treasures of her Beloved. ||6||<br>
  Separated from You for countless incarnations, I have suffered in pain.<br>
  Please take my hand, O my Beloved Sovereign Lord God. ||7||<br>
  Prays Nanak, the Lord is, and shall always be.<br>
  She alone is ravished and enjoyed, with whom the Beloved Lord is pleased. ||8||1||<br>

  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  The color of safflower is transitory; it lasts for only a few days.<br>
  Without the Name, the false woman is deluded by doubt and plundered by thieves.<br>
  But those who are attuned to the True Lord, are not reincarnated again. ||1||<br>
  How can one who is already dyed in the color of the Lord's Love, be colored any other color?<br>
  So serve God the Dyer, and focus your consciousness on the True Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  You wander around in the four directions, but without the good fortune of destiny, you shall never obtain wealth.<br>
  If you are plundered by corruption and vice, you shall wander around, but like a fugitive, you shall find no place of rest.<br>
  Only those who are protected by the Guru are saved; their minds are attuned to the Word of the Shabad. ||2||<br>
  Those who wear white clothes, but have filthy and stone-hearted minds,<br>
  may chant the Lord's Name with their mouths, but they are engrossed in duality; they are thieves.<br>
  They do not understand their own roots; they are beasts. They are just animals! ||3||<br>
  Constantly, continually, the mortal seeks pleasures. Constantly, continually, he begs for peace.<br>
  But he does not think of the Creator Lord, and so he is overtaken by pain, again and again.<br>
  But one, within whose mind the Giver of pleasure and pain dwells - how can his body feel any need? ||4||<br>
  One who has a karmic debt to pay off is summoned, and the Messenger of Death smashes his head.<br>
  When his account is called for, it has to be given. After it is reviewed, payment is demanded.<br>
  Only love for the True One will save you; the Forgiver forgives. ||5||<br>
  If you make any friend other than God, you shall die and mingle with the dust.<br>
  Gazing upon the many games of love, you are beguiled and bewildered; you come and go in reincarnation.<br>
  Only by God's Grace can you be saved. By His Grace, He unites in His Union. ||6||<br>
  O careless one, you are totally lacking any wisdom; do not seek wisdom without the Guru.<br>
  By indecision and inner conflict, you shall come to ruin. Good and bad both pull at you.<br>
  Without being attuned to the Word of the Shabad and the Fear of God, all come under the gaze of the Messenger of Death. ||7||<br>
  He who created the creation and sustains it, gives sustenance to all.<br>
  How can you forget Him from your mind? He is the Great Giver, forever and ever.<br>
  Nanak shall never forget the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the Support of the unsupported. ||8||1||2||<br>

  This human birth is so difficult to obtain; the Gurmukh obtains it.<br>
  The mind and body are dyed in the deep red color of devotional love, if it pleases the True Guru. ||1||<br>
  He departs with his life embellished and successful, taking the merchandise of the True Name.<br>
  He is honored in the Darbaar, the Royal Court, of the Lord, through the Shabad, the Word of the True Guru, and the Fear of God. ||1||Pause||<br>
  One who praises the True Lord with his mind and body, pleases the Mind of the True Lord.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 19 - Raag Soohee - Part 025</h2></center>
  Attuned to the Beloved Lord, the mind is appeased, and finds the Perfect Guru. ||2||<br>
  I live, by cherishing Your Glorious Virtues; You dwell deep within me.<br>
  You dwell within my mind, and so it naturally celebrates in joyful delight. ||3||<br>
  O my foolish mind, how can I teach and instruct you?<br>
  As Gurmukh, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and so become attuned to His Love. ||4||<br>
  Continually, continuously, remember and cherish your Beloved Lord in your heart.<br>
  For if you depart with virtue, then pain shall never afflict you. ||5||<br>
  The self-willed manmukh wanders around, deluded by doubt; he does not enshrine love for the Lord.<br>
  He dies as a stranger to his own self, and his mind and body are spoiled. ||6||<br>
  Performing service to the Guru, you shall go home with the profit.<br>
  Through the Word of the Guru's Bani, and the Shabad, the Word of God, the state of Nirvaanaa is attained. ||7||<br>
  Nanak makes this one prayer: if it pleases Your Will,<br>
  bless me with a home in Your Name, Lord, that I may sing Your Glorious Praises. ||8||1||3||<br>
  Soohee, First Mehl:<br>
  As iron is melted in the forge and re-shaped,<br>
  so is the godless materialist reincarnated, and forced to wander aimlessly. ||1||<br>
  Without understanding, everything is suffering, earning only more suffering.<br>
  In his ego, he comes and goes, wandering in confusion, deluded by doubt. ||1||Pause||<br>
  You save those who are Gurmukh, O Lord, through meditation on Your Naam.<br>
  You blend with Yourself, by Your Will, those who practice the Word of the Shabad. ||2||<br>
  You created the Creation, and You Yourself gaze upon it; whatever You give, is received.<br>
  You watch, establish and disestablish; You keep all in Your vision at Your Door. ||3||<br>
  The body shall turn to dust, and the soul shall fly away.<br>
  So where are their homes and resting places now? They do not find the Mansion of the Lord's Presence, either. ||4||<br>
  In the pitch darkness of broad daylight, their wealth is being plundered.<br>
  Pride is looting their homes like a thief; where can they file their complaint? ||5||<br>
  The thief does not break into the home of the Gurmukh; he is awake in the Name of the Lord.<br>
  The Word of the Shabad puts out the fire of desire; God's Light illuminates and enlightens. ||6||<br>
  The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is a jewel, a ruby; the Guru has taught me the Word of the Shabad.<br>
  One who follows the Guru's Teachings remains forever free of desire. ||7||<br>
  Night and day, enshrine the Lord's Name within your mind.<br>
  Please unite Nanak in Union, O Lord, if it is pleasing to Your Will. ||8||2||4||<br>
  Soohee, First Mehl:<br>
  Never forget the Naam, the Name of the Lord, from your mind; night and day, meditate on it.<br>
  As You keep me, in Your Merciful Grace, so do I find peace. ||1||<br>
  I am blind, and the Lord's Name is my cane.<br>
  I remain under the Sheltering Support of my Lord and Master; I am not enticed by Maya the enticer. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Wherever I look, there the Guru has shown me that God is always with me.<br>
  Searching inwardly and outwardly as well, I came to see Him, through the Word of the Shabad. ||2||<br>
  So serve the True Guru with love, through the Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord.<br>
  As it pleases You, so by Your Will, You destroy my doubts and fears. ||3||<br>
  At the very moment of birth, he is afflicted with pain, and in the end, he comes only to die.<br>
  Birth and death are validated and approved, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||4||<br>
  When there is no ego, there You are; You fashioned all of this.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 19 - Raag Soohee - Part 026</h2></center>
  You Yourself establish and disestablish; through the Word of Your Shabad, You elevate and exalt. ||5||<br>
  When the body rolls in the dust, it is not known where the soul has gone.<br>
  He Himself is permeating and pervading; this is wonderful and amazing! ||6||<br>
  You are not far away, God; You know everything.<br>
  The Gurmukh sees You ever-present; You are deep within the nucleus of our inner self. ||7||<br>
  Please, bless me with a home in Your Name; may my inner self be at peace.<br>
  May slave Nanak sing Your Glorious Praises; O True Guru, please share the Teachings with me. ||8||3||5||<br>
  Raag Soohee, Third Mehl, First House, Ashtapadees:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Everything comes from the Naam, the Name of the Lord; without the True Guru, the Naam is not experienced.<br>
  The Word of the Guru's Shabad is the sweetest and most sublime essence, but without tasting it, its flavor cannot be experienced.<br>
  He wastes this human life in exchange for a mere shell; he does not understand his own self.<br>
  But, if he becomes Gurmukh, then he comes to know the One Lord, and the disease of egotism does not afflict him. ||1||<br>
  I am a sacrifice to my Guru, who has lovingly attached me to the True Lord.<br>
  Concentrating on the Word of the Shabad, the soul is illumined and enlightened. I remain absorbed in celestial ecstasy. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The Gurmukh sings the Praises of the Lord; the Gurmukh understands. The Gurmukh contemplates the Word of the Shabad.<br>
  Body and soul are totally rejuvenated through the Guru; the Gurmukh's affairs are resolved in his favor.<br>
  The blind self-willed manmukh acts blindly, and earns only poison in this world.<br>
  Enticed by Maya, he suffers in constant pain, without the most Beloved Guru. ||2||<br>
  He alone is a selfless servant, who serves the True Guru, and walks in harmony with the True Guru's Will.<br>
  The True Shabad, the Word of God, is the True Praise of God; enshrine the True Lord within your mind.<br>
  The Gurmukh speaks the True Word of Gurbani, and egotism departs from within.<br>
  He Himself is the Giver, and True are His actions. He proclaims the True Word of the Shabad. ||3||<br>
  The Gurmukh works, and the Gurmukh earns; the Gurmukh inspires others to chant the Naam.<br>
  He is forever unattached, imbued with the Love of the True Lord, intuitively in harmony with the Guru.<br>
  The self-willed manmukh always tells lies; he plants the seeds of poison, and eats only poison.<br>
  He is bound and gagged by the Messenger of Death, and burnt in the fire of desire; who can save him, except the Guru? ||4||<br>
  True is that place of pilgrimage, where one bathes in the pool of Truth, and achieves self-realization as Gurmukh. The Gurmukh understands his own self.<br>
  The Lord has shown that the Word of the Guru's Shabad is the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage; bathing in it, filth is washed away.<br>
  True and Immaculate is the True Word of His Shabad; no filth touches or clings to Him.<br>
  True Praise, True Devotional Praise, is obtained from the Perfect Guru. ||5||<br>
  Body, mind, everything belongs to the Lord; but the evil-minded ones cannot even say this.<br>
  If such is the Hukam of the Lord's Command, then one becomes pure and spotless, and the ego is taken away from within.<br>
  I have intuitively tasted the Guru's Teachings, and the fire of my desire has been quenched.<br>
  Attuned to the Word of the Guru's Shabad, one is naturally intoxicated, merging imperceptibly into the Lord. ||6||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 19 - Raag Soohee - Part 027</h2></center>
  The Name of the Lord is known as True, through the Love of the Beloved Guru.<br>
  True Glorious Greatness is obtained from the Guru, through the Beloved True Name.<br>
  The One True Lord is permeating and pervading among all; how rare is the one who contemplates this.<br>
  The Lord Himself unites us in Union, and forgives us; He embellishes us with true devotional worship. ||7||<br>
  All is Truth; Truth, and Truth alone is pervading; how rare is the Gurmukh who knows this.<br>
  Birth and death occur by the Hukam of His Command; the Gurmukh understands his own self.<br>
  He meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and so pleases the True Guru. He receives whatever rewards he desires.<br>
  O Nanak, one who eradicates self-conceit from within, has everything. ||8||1||<br>
  Soohee, Third Mehl:<br>
  The body-bride is very beautiful; she dwells with her Husband Lord.<br>
  She becomes the happy soul-bride of her True Husband Lord, contemplating the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<br>
  The Lord's devotee is forever attuned to the Lord's Love; her ego is burnt away from within. ||1||<br>
  Waaho! Waaho! Blessed, blessed is the Word of the Perfect Guru's Bani.<br>
  It wells up and springs forth from the Perfect Guru, and merges into Truth. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Everything is within the Lord - the continents, worlds and nether regions.<br>
  The Life of the World, the Great Giver, dwells within the body; He is the Cherisher of all.<br>
  The body-bride is eternally beautiful; the Gurmukh contemplates the Naam. ||2||<br>
  The Lord Himself dwells within the body; He is invisible and cannot be seen.<br>
  The foolish self-willed manmukh does not understand; he goes out searching for the Lord externally.<br>
  One who serves the True Guru is always at peace; the True Guru has shown me the Invisible Lord. ||3||<br>
  Within the body there are jewels and precious treasures, the over-flowing treasure of devotion.<br>
  Within this body are the nine continents of the earth, its markets, cities and streets.<br>
  Within this body are the nine treasures of the Naam; contemplating the Word of the Guru's Shabad, it is obtained. ||4||<br>
  Within the body, the Lord estimates the weight; He Himself is the weigher.<br>
  This mind is the jewel, the gem, the diamond; it is absolutely priceless.<br>
  The Naam, the Name of the Lord, cannot be purchased at any price; the Naam is obtained by contemplating the Guru. ||5||<br>
  One who becomes Gurmukh searches this body; all others just wander around in confusion.<br>
  That humble being alone obtains it, unto whom the Lord bestows it. What other clever tricks can anyone try?<br>
  Within the body, the Fear of God and Love for Him abides; by Guru's Grace, they are obtained. ||6||<br>
  Within the body, are Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, from whom the whole world emanated.<br>
  The True Lord has staged and contrived His own play; the expanse of the Universe comes and goes.<br>
  The Perfect True Guru Himself has made it clear, that emancipation comes through the True Name. ||7||<br>
  That body, which serves the True Guru, is embellished by the True Lord Himself.<br>
  Without the Name, the mortal finds no place of rest in the Court of the Lord; he shall be tortured by the Messenger of Death.<br>
  O Nanak, true glory is bestowed, when the Lord showers His Mercy. ||8||2||<br>

  Raag Soohee, Third Mehl, Tenth House:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Do not praise the world; it shall simply pass away.<br>
  Do not praise other people; they shall die and turn to dust. ||1||<br>
  Waaho! Waaho! Hail, hail to my Lord and Master.<br>
  As Gurmukh, forever praise the One who is forever True, Independent and Carefree. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Making worldly friendships, the self-willed manmukhs burn and die.<br>
  In the City of Death, they are bound and gagged and beaten; this opportunity shall never come again. ||2||<br>
  The lives of the Gurmukhs are fruitful and blessed; they are committed to the True Word of the Shabad.<br>
  Their souls are illuminated by the Lord, and they dwell in peace and pleasure. ||3||<br>
  Those who forget the Word of the Guru's Shabad are engrossed in the love of duality.<br>
  Their hunger and thirst never leave them, and night and day, they wander around burning. ||4||<br>
  Those who make friendships with the wicked, and harbor animosity to the Saints,<br>
  shall drown with their families, and their entire lineage shall be obliterated. ||5||<br>
  It is not good to slander anyone, but the foolish, self-willed manmukhs still do it.<br>
  The faces of the slanderers turn black, and they fall into the most horrible hell. ||6||<br>
  O mind, as you serve, so do you become, and so are the deeds that you do.<br>
  Whatever you yourself plant, that is what you shall have to eat; nothing else can be said about this. ||7||<br>
  The speech of the great spiritual beings has a higher purpose.<br>
  They are filled to over-flowing with Ambrosial Nectar, and they have absolutely no greed at all. ||8||<br>
  The virtuous accumulate virtue, and teach others.<br>
  Those who meet with them are so very fortunate; night and day, they chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||9||<br>
  He who created the Universe, gives sustenance to it.<br>
  The One Lord alone is the Great Giver. He Himself is the True Master. ||10||<br>
  That True Lord is always with you; the Gurmukh is blessed with His Glance of Grace.<br>
  He Himself shall forgive you, and merge you into Himself; forever cherish and contemplate God. ||11||<br>
  The mind is impure; only the True Lord is pure. So how can it merge into Him?<br>
  God merges it into Himself, and then it remains merged; through the Word of His Shabad, the ego is burnt away. ||12||<br>
  Cursed is the life in this world, of one who forgets her True Husband Lord.<br>
  The Lord grants His Mercy, and she does not forget Him, if she contemplates the Guru's Teachings. ||13||<br>
  The True Guru unites her, and so she remains united with Him, with the True Lord enshrined within her heart.<br>
  And so united, she will not be separated again; she remains in the love and affection of the Guru. ||14||<br>
  I praise my Husband Lord, contemplating the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<br>
  Meeting with my Beloved, I have found peace; I am His most beautiful and happy soul-bride. ||15||<br>
  The mind of the self-willed manmukh is not softened; his consciousness is totally polluted and stone-hearted.<br>
  Even if the venomous snake is fed on milk, it shall still be filled with poison. ||16||<br>
  He Himself does - who else should I ask? He Himself is the Forgiving Lord.<br>
  Through the Guru's Teachings, filth is washed away, and then, one is embellished with the ornament of Truth. ||17||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 19 - Raag Soohee - Part 029</h2></center>
  True is the Banker, and True are His traders. The false ones cannot remain there.<br>
  They do not love the Truth - they are consumed by their pain. ||18||<br>
  The world wanders around in the filth of egotism; it dies, and is re-born, over and again.<br>
  He acts in accordance with the karma of his past actions, which no one can erase. ||19||<br>
  But if he joins the Society of the Saints, then he comes to embrace love for the Truth.<br>
  Praising the True Lord with a truthful mind, he becomes true in the Court of the True Lord. ||20||<br>
  The Teachings of the Perfect Guru are perfect; meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, day and night.<br>
  Egotism and self-conceit are terrible diseases; tranquility and stillness come from within. ||21||<br>
  I praise my Guru; bowing down to Him again and again, I fall at His Feet.<br>
  I place my body and mind in offering unto Him, eradicating self-conceit from within. ||22||<br>
  Indecision leads to ruin; focus your attention on the One Lord.<br>
  Renounce egotism and self-conceit, and remain merged in Truth. ||23||<br>
  Those who meet with the True Guru are my Siblings of Destiny; they are committed to the True Word of the Shabad.<br>
  Those who merge with the True Lord shall not be separated again; they are judged to be True in the Court of the Lord. ||24||<br>
  They are my Siblings of Destiny, and they are my friends, who serve the True Lord.<br>
  They sell off their sins and demerits like straw, and enter into the partnership of virtue. ||25||<br>
  In the partnership of virtue, peace wells up, and they perform true devotional worship service.<br>
  They deal in Truth, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and they earn the profit of the Naam. ||26||<br>
  Gold and silver may be earned by committing sins, but they will not go with you when you die.<br>
  Nothing will go with you in the end, except the Name; all are plundered by the Messenger of Death. ||27||<br>
  The Lord's Name is the nourishment of the mind; cherish it, and preserve it carefully within your heart.<br>
  This nourishment is inexhaustible; it is always with the Gurmukhs. ||28||<br>
  O mind, if you forget the Primal Lord, you shall depart, having lost your honor.<br>
  This world is engrossed in the love of duality; follow the Guru's Teachings, and meditate on the True Lord. ||29||<br>
  The Lord's value cannot be estimated; the Lord's Praises cannot be written down.<br>
  When one's mind and body are attuned to the Word of the Guru's Shabad, one remains merged in the Lord. ||30||<br>
  My Husband Lord is playful; He has imbued me with His Love, with natural ease.<br>
  The soul-bride is imbued with His Love, when her Husband Lord merges her into His Being. ||31||<br>
  Even those who have been separated for so very long, are reunited with Him, when they serve the True Guru.<br>
  The nine treasures of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, are deep within the nucleus of the self; consuming them, they are still never exhausted. Chant the Glorious Praises of the Lord, with natural ease. ||32||<br>
  They are not born, and they do not die; they do not suffer in pain.<br>
  Those who are protected by the Guru are saved. They celebrate with the Lord. ||33||<br>
  Those who are united with the Lord, the True Friend, are not separated again; night and day, they remain blended with Him.<br>
  In this world, only a rare few are known, O Nanak, to have obtained the True Lord. ||34||1||3||<br>

  The Guru is like the Mansarovar Lake; only the very fortunate beings find Him.<br>
  The Gurmukhs, the selfless servants, seek out the Guru; the swan-souls feed there on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||2||<br>
  The Gurmukhs meditate on the Naam, and remain linked to the Naam.<br>
  Whatever is pre-ordained, accept it as the Will of the Guru. ||3||<br>
  By great good fortune, I searched my home, and found the treasure of the Naam.<br>
  The Perfect Guru has shown God to me; I have realized the Lord, the Supreme Soul. ||4||<br>
  There is One God of all; there is no other at all.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, the Lord comes to abide in the mind; in the heart of such a one, He is revealed. ||5||<br>
  God is the Inner-knower of all hearts; God dwells in every place.<br>
  So who should we call evil? Behold the Word of the Shabad, and lovingly dwell upon it. ||6||<br>
  He calls others bad and good, as long as he is in duality.<br>
  The Gurmukh understands the One and Only Lord; He is absorbed in the One Lord. ||7||<br>
  That is selfless service, which pleases God, and which is approved by God.<br>

  When the Lord shows Mercy unto me, then I meet the True Guru; I meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||Pause||<br>
  If You will bless me with happiness, then I will worship and adore You. Even in pain, I will meditate on You. ||2||<br>
  Even if You give me hunger, I will still feel satisfied; I am joyful, even in the midst of sorrow. ||3||<br>
  I would cut my mind and body apart into pieces, and offer them all to You; I would burn myself in fire. ||4||<br>

  If You seat me near You, then I worship and adore You. Even if You beat me and drive me out, I will still meditate on You. ||8||<br>
  If people praise me, the praise is Yours. Even if they slander me, I will not leave You. ||9||<br>
  If You are on my side, then anyone can say anything. But if I were to forget You, then I would die. ||10||<br>
  I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to my Guru; falling at His Feet, I surrender to the Saintly Guru. ||11||<br>
  Poor Nanak has gone insane, longing for the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan. ||12||<br>
  Even in violent storms and torrential rain, I go out to catch a glimpse of my Guru. ||13||<br>
  Even though the oceans and the salty seas are very vast, the GurSikh will cross over it to get to his Guru. ||14||<br>
  Just as the mortal dies without water, so does the Sikh die without the Guru. ||15||<br>

  Nanak offers this prayer to the Lord, that he may meet the Guru, and find peace. ||18||<br>
  You Yourself are the Guru, and You Yourself are the chaylaa, the disciple; through the Guru, I meditate on You. ||19||<br>
  Those who serve You, become You. You preserve the honor of Your servants. ||20||<br>
  O Lord, Your devotional worship is a treasure over-flowing. One who loves You, is blessed with it. ||21||<br>
  That humble being alone receives it, unto whom You bestow it. All other clever tricks are fruitless. ||22||<br>
  Remembering, remembering, remembering my Guru in meditation, my sleeping mind is awakened. ||23||<br>
  Poor Nanak begs for this one blessing, that he may become the slave of the slaves of the Lord. ||24||<br>
  Even if the Guru rebukes me, He still seems very sweet to me. And if He actually forgives me, that is the Guru's greatness. ||25||<br>
  That which Gurmukh speaks is certified and approved. Whatever the self-willed manmukh says is not accepted. ||26||<br>
  Even in the cold, the frost and the snow, the GurSikh still goes out to see his Guru. ||27||<br>
  All day and night, I gaze upon my Guru; I install the Guru's Feet in my eyes. ||28||<br>
  I make so many efforts for the sake of the Guru; only that which pleases the Guru is accepted and approved. ||29||<br>
  Night and day, I worship the Guru's Feet in adoration; have Mercy upon me, O my Lord and Master. ||30||<br>

  One who constantly chants the Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam with his tongue,<br>
  is not touched or affected by Maya, the embodiment of disease. ||4||<br>
  Chant and meditate on God, the Lord of the Universe, and all of your companions shall be carried across;<br>
  the five thieves will not even approach. ||5||<br>
  One who meditates on the One God in thought, word and deed<br>
  - that humble being receives the fruits of all rewards. ||6||<br>
  Showering His Mercy, God has made me His own;<br>
  He has blessed me with the unique and singular Naam, and the sublime essence of devotion. ||7||<br>
  In the beginning, in the middle, and in the end, He is God.<br>
  O Nanak, without Him, there is no other at all. ||8||1||2||<br>

  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Gazing upon them, my mind is enraptured. How can I join them and be with them?<br>
  They are Saints and friends, good friends of my mind, who inspire me and help me tune in to God's Love.<br>
  My love for them shall never die; it shall never, ever be broken. ||1||<br>
  O Supreme Lord God, please grant me Your Grace, that I might constantly sing Your Glorious Praises.<br>
  Come, and meet with me, O Saints, and good friends; let us chant and meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the Best Friend of my mind. ||1||Pause||<br>
  He does not see, he does not hear, and he does not understand; he is blind, enticed and bewitched by Maya.<br>
  His body is false and transitory; it shall perish. And still, he entangles himself in false pursuits.<br>
  They alone depart victorious, who have meditated on the Naam; they stick with the Perfect Guru. ||2||<br>
  By the Hukam of God's Will, they come into this world, and they leave upon receipt of His Hukam.<br>
  By His Hukam, the Expanse of the Universe is expanded. By His Hukam, they enjoy pleasures.<br>
  One who forgets the Creator Lord, suffers sorrow and separation. ||3||<br>
  One who is pleasing to his God, goes to His Court dressed in robes of honor.<br>
  One who meditates on the Naam, the One Name, finds peace in this world; his face is radiant and bright.<br>
  The Supreme Lord confers honor and respect on those who serve the Guru with true love. ||4||<br>
  He is pervading and permeating the spaces and interspaces; He loves and cherishes all beings.<br>
  I have accumulated the true treasure, the wealth and riches of the One Name.<br>
  I shall never forget Him from my mind, since He has been so merciful to me. ||5||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 19 - Raag Soohee - Part 034</h2></center>
  My comings and goings have ended; the Formless Lord now dwells within my mind.<br>
  His limits cannot be found; He is lofty and exalted, inaccessible and infinite.<br>
  One who forgets His God, shall die and be reincarnated, hundreds of thousands of times. ||6||<br>
  They alone bear true love for their God, within whose minds He Himself dwells.<br>
  So dwell only with those who share their virtues; chant and meditate on God, twenty-four hours a day.<br>
  They are attuned to the Love of the Transcendent Lord; all their sorrows and afflictions are dispelled. ||7||<br>
  You are the Creator, You are the Cause of causes; You are the One and the many.<br>
  You are All-powerful, You are present everywhere; You are the subtle intellect, the clear wisdom.<br>
  Nanak chants and meditates forever on the Naam, the Support of the humble devotees. ||8||1||3||<br>
  Raag Soohee, Fifth Mehl, Ashtapadees, Tenth House, Kaafee:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Even though I have made mistakes, and even though I have been wrong, I am still called Yours, O my Lord and Master.<br>
  Those who enshrine love for another, die regretting and repenting. ||1||<br>
  I shall never leave my Husband Lord's side.<br>
  My Beloved Lover is always and forever beautiful. He is my hope and inspiration. ||1||Pause||<br>
  You are my Best Friend; You are my relative. I am so proud of You.<br>
  And when You dwell within me, I am at peace. I am without honor - You are my honor. ||2||<br>
  And when You are pleased with me, O treasure of mercy, then I do not see any other.<br>
  Please grant me this blessing, that that I may forever dwell upon You and cherish You within my heart. ||3||<br>
  Let my feet walk on Your Path, and let my eyes behold the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan.<br>
  With my ears, I will listen to Your Sermon, if the Guru becomes merciful to me. ||4||<br>
  Hundreds of thousands and millions do not equal even one hair of Yours, O my Beloved.<br>
  You are the King of kings; I cannot even describe Your Glorious Praises. ||5||<br>
  Your brides are countless; they are all greater than I am.<br>
  Please bless me with Your Glance of Grace, even for an instant; please bless me with Your Darshan, that I may revel in Your Love. ||6||<br>
  Seeing Him, my mind is comforted and consoled, and my sins and mistakes are far removed.<br>
  How could I ever forget Him, O my mother? He is permeating and pervading everywhere. ||7||<br>
  In humility, I bowed down in surrender to Him, and He naturally met me.<br>
  I have received what was pre-ordained for me, O Nanak, with the help and assistance of the Saints. ||8||1||4||<br>
  Soohee, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  The Simritees, the Vedas, the Puraanas and the other holy scriptures proclaim<br>
  that without the Naam, everything is false and worthless. ||1||<br>
  The infinite treasure of the Naam abides within the minds of the devotees.<br>
  Birth and death, attachment and suffering, are erased in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Those who indulge in attachment, conflict and egotism shall surely weep and cry.<br>
  Those who are separated from the Naam shall never find any peace. ||2||<br>
  Crying out, "Mine! Mine!", he is bound in bondage.<br>
  Entangled in Maya, he is reincarnated in heaven and hell. ||3||<br>
  Searching, searching, searching, I have come to understand the essence of reality.<br>
  Without the Naam, there is no peace at all, and the mortal will surely fail. ||4||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 19 - Raag Soohee - Part 035</h2></center>
  Many come and go; they die, and die again, and are reincarnated.<br>
  Without understanding, they are totally useless, and they wander in reincarnation. ||5||<br>
  They alone join the Saadh Sangat, unto whom the Lord becomes Merciful.<br>
  They chant and meditate on the Ambrosial Name of the Lord. ||6||<br>
  Uncounted millions, so many they are endless, search for Him.<br>
  But only that one, who understands his own self, sees God near at hand. ||7||<br>
  Never forget me, O Great Giver - please bless me with Your Naam.<br>
  To sing Your Glorious Praises day and night - O Nanak, this is my heart-felt desire. ||8||2||5||16||<br>
  Raag Soohee, First Mehl, Kuchajee ~ The Ungraceful Bride:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  I am ungraceful and ill-mannered, full of endless faults. How can I go to enjoy my Husband Lord?<br>
  Each of His soul-brides is better than the rest - who even knows my name?<br>
  Those brides who enjoy their Husband Lord are very blessed, resting in the shade of the mango tree.<br>
  I do not have their virtue - who can I blame for this?<br>
  Which of Your Virtues, O Lord, should I speak of? Which of Your Names should I chant?<br>
  I cannot even reach one of Your Virtues. I am forever a sacrifice to You.<br>
  Gold, silver, pearls and rubies are pleasing.<br>
  My Husband Lord has blessed me with these things, and I have focused my thoughts on them.<br>
  Palaces of brick and mud are built and decorated with stones;<br>
  I have been fooled by these decorations, and I do not sit near my Husband Lord.<br>
  The cranes shriek overhead in the sky, and the herons have come to rest.<br>
  The bride has gone to her father-in-law's house; in the world hereafter, what face will she show?<br>
  She kept sleeping as the day dawned; she forgot all about her journey.<br>
  She separated herself from her Husband Lord, and now she suffers in pain.<br>
  Virtue is in You, O Lord; I am totally without virtue. This is Nanak's only prayer:<br>
  You give all Your nights to the virtuous soul-brides. I know I am unworthy, but isn't there a night for me as well? ||1||<br>
  Soohee, First Mehl, Suchajee ~ The Noble And Graceful Bride:<br>
  When I have You, then I have everything. O my Lord and Master, You are my wealth and capital.<br>
  Within You, I abide in peace; within You, I am congratulated.<br>
  By the Pleasure of Your Will, You bestow thrones and greatness. And by the Pleasure of Your Will, You make us beggars and wanderers.<br>
  By the Pleasure of Your Will, the ocean flows in the desert, and the lotus blossoms in the sky.<br>
  By the Pleasure of Your Will, one crosses over the terrifying world-ocean; by the Pleasure of Your Will, he sinks down into it.<br>
  By the Pleasure of His Will, that Lord becomes my Husband, and I am imbued with the Praises of the Lord, the treasure of virtue.<br>
  By the Pleasure of Your Will, O my Husband Lord, I am afraid of You, and I come and go, and die.<br>
  You, O my Husband Lord, are inaccessible and immeasurable; talking and speaking of You, I have fallen at Your Feet.<br>
  What should I beg for? What should I say and hear? I am hungry and thirsty for the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan.<br>
  Through the Word of the Guru's Teachings, I have found my Husband Lord. This is Nanak's true prayer. ||2||<br>

  When I see a Sikh of the Guru, I humbly bow and fall at his feet.<br>
  I tell to him the pain of my soul, and beg him to unite me with the Guru, my Best Friend.<br>
  I ask that he impart to me such an understanding, that my mind will not go out wandering anywhere else.<br>
  I dedicate this mind to you. Please, show me the Path to God.<br>
  I have come so far, seeking the Protection of Your Sanctuary.<br>
  Within my mind, I place my hopes in You; please, take my pain and suffering away!<br>
  So walk on this Path, O sister soul-brides; do that work which the Guru tells you to do.<br>
  Abandon the intellectual pursuits of the mind, and forget the love of duality.<br>
  In this way, you shall obtain the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan; the hot winds shall not even touch you.<br>
  By myself, I do not even know how to speak; I speak all that the Lord commands.<br>
  I am blessed with the treasure of the Lord's devotional worship; Guru Nanak has been kind and compassionate to me.<br>

  Raag Soohee, Chhant, First Mehl, First House:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Intoxicated with the wine of youth, I did not realize that I was only a guest at my parents' home (in this world).<br>
  My consciousness is polluted with faults and mistakes; without the Guru, virtue does not even enter into me.<br>
  I have not known the value of virtue; I have been deluded by doubt. I have wasted away my youth in vain.<br>
  I have not known my Husband Lord, His celestial home and gate, or the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. I have not had the pleasure of my Husband Lord's celestial peace.<br>
  After consulting the True Guru, I have not walked on the Path; the night of my life is passing away in sleep.<br>
  O Nanak, in the prime of my youth, I am a widow; without my Husband Lord, the soul-bride is wasting away. ||1||<br>
  O father, give me in marriage to the Lord; I am pleased with Him as my Husband. I belong to Him.<br>
  He is pervading throughout the four ages, and the Word of His Bani permeates the three worlds.<br>
  The Husband Lord of the three worlds ravishes and enjoys His virtuous brides, but He keeps the ungraceful and unvirtuous ones far away.<br>
  As are our hopes, so are our minds' desires, which the All-pervading Lord brings to fulfillment.<br>
  The bride of the Lord is forever happy and virtuous; she shall never be a widow, and she shall never have to wear dirty clothes.<br>
  O Nanak, I love my True Husband Lord; my Beloved is the same, age after age. ||2||<br>
  O Baba, calculate that auspicious moment, when I too shall be going to my in-laws' house.<br>
  The moment of that marriage will be set by the Hukam of God's Command; His Will cannot be changed.<br>
  The karmic record of past deeds, written by the Creator Lord, cannot be erased by anyone.<br>
  The most respected member of the marriage party, my Husband, is the independent Lord of all beings, pervading and permeating the three worlds.<br>
  Maya, crying out in pain, leaves, seeing that the bride and the groom are in love.<br>
  O Nanak, the peace of the Mansion of God's Presence comes through the True Word of the Shabad; the bride keeps the Guru's Feet enshrined in her mind. ||3||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 19 - Raag Soohee - Part 037</h2></center>

  My True Beloved Husband Lord desires me; He has joined me to Himself, and made my intellect pure and sublime.<br>
  By good destiny I met Him, and was given a place of rest; through the Guru's Wisdom, I have become virtuous.<br>
  I gather lasting Truth and contentment in my lap, and my Beloved is pleased with my truthful speech.<br>

  Sing the true songs of joy and God will be pleased. You shall be celebrated throughout the four ages.<br>
  My Husband Lord has come into my home, and my place is adorned and decorated. Through the Shabad, my affairs have been resolved.<br>
  Applying the ointment, the supreme essence, of divine wisdom to my eyes, I see the Lord's form throughout the three worlds.<br>
  So join with me, my sisters, and sing the songs of joy and delight; my friends have come into my home. ||2||<br>
  My mind and body are drenched with Ambrosial Nectar;<br>
  deep within the nucleus of my self, is the jewel of the Lord's Love.<br>
  This invaluable jewel is deep within me; I contemplate the supreme essence of reality.<br>
  Living beings are mere beggars; You are the Giver of rewards; You are the Giver to each and every being.<br>
  You are Wise and All-knowing, the Inner-knower; You Yourself created the creation.<br>
  So listen, O my sisters - the Enticer has enticed my mind. My body and mind are drenched with Nectar. ||3||<br>
  O Supreme Soul of the World,<br>
  Your play is true.<br>
  Your play is true, O Inaccessible and Infinite Lord; without You, who can make me understand?<br>
  There are millions of Siddhas and enlightened seekers, but without You, who can call himself one?<br>

  Your Light is in everyone; through it, You are known. Through love, You are easily met.<br>
  O Nanak, I am a sacrifice to my Friend; He has come home to meet with those who are true. ||1||<br>
  When her Friend comes to her home, the bride is very pleased.<br>
  She is fascinated with the True Word of the Lord's Shabad; gazing upon her Lord and Master, she is filled with joy.<br>
  She is filled with virtuous joy, and is totally pleased, when she is ravished and enjoyed by her Lord, and imbued with His Love.<br>
  Her faults and demerits are eradicated, and she roofs her home with virtue, through the Perfect Lord, the Architect of Destiny.<br>
  Conquering the thieves, she dwells as the mistress of her home, and administers justice wisely.<br>
  O Nanak, through the Lord's Name, she is emancipated; through the Guru's Teachings, she meets her Beloved. ||2||<br>
  The young bride has found her Husband Lord; her hopes and desires are fulfilled.<br>
  She enjoys and ravishes her Husband Lord, and blends into the Word of the Shabad, pervading and permeating everywhere; the Lord is not far away.<br>
  God is not far away; He is in each and every heart. All are His brides.<br>
  He Himself is the Enjoyer, He Himself ravishes and enjoys; this is His glorious greatness.<br>
  He is imperishable, immovable, invaluable and infinite. The True Lord is obtained through the Perfect Guru.<br>
  O Nanak, He Himself unites in Union; by His Glance of Grace, He lovingly attunes them to Himself. ||3||<br>
  My Husband Lord dwells in the loftiest balcony; He is the Supreme Lord of the three worlds.<br>
  I am amazed, gazing upon His glorious excellence; the unstruck sound current of the Shabad vibrates and resonates.<br>
  I contemplate the Shabad, and perform sublime deeds; I am blessed with the insignia, the banner of the Lord's Name.<br>
  Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the false find no place of rest; only the jewel of the Naam brings acceptance and renown.<br>
  Perfect is my honor, perfect is my intellect and password. I shall not have to come or go.<br>

  The moon glows, by the Lord's gift, and the darkness of suffering is taken away.<br>
  The marriage party of virtue looks beautiful with the Groom; He chooses His enticing bride with care.<br>
  The wedding is performed with glorious splendor; He has arrived, accompanied by the vibrations of the Panch Shabad, the Five Primal Sounds.<br>
  The One who created the world, watches over it; He enjoins the people of the world to their tasks. ||1||<br>
  I am a sacrifice to my pure friends, the immaculate Saints.<br>
  This body is attached to them, and we have shared our minds.<br>
  We have shared our minds - how could I forget those friends?<br>
  Seeing them brings joy to my heart; I keep them clasped to my soul.<br>
  They have all virtues and merits, forever and ever; they have no demerits or faults at all.<br>
  I am a sacrifice to my pure friends, the immaculate Saints. ||2||<br>
  One who has a basket of fragrant virtues, should enjoy its fragrance.<br>
  If my friends have virtues, I will share in them.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 19 - Raag Soohee - Part 039</h2></center>
  Let us form a partnership, and share our virtues; let us abandon our faults, and walk on the Path.<br>
  Let us wear our virtues like silk clothes; let us decorate ourselves, and enter the arena.<br>
  Let us speak of goodness, wherever we go and sit; let us skim off the Ambrosial Nectar, and drink it in.<br>
  One who has a basket of fragrant virtues, should enjoy its fragrance. ||3||<br>
  He Himself acts; unto whom should we complain? No one else does anything.<br>
  Go ahead and complain to Him, if He makes a mistake.<br>
  If He makes a mistake, go ahead and complain to Him; but how can the Creator Himself make a mistake?<br>
  He sees, He hears, and without our asking, without our begging, He gives His gifts.<br>
  The Great Giver, the Architect of the Universe, gives His gifts. O Nanak, He is the True Lord.<br>

  Soohee, First Mehl:<br>
  My mind is imbued with His Glorious Praises; I chant them, and He is pleasing to my mind.<br>
  Truth is the ladder to the Guru; climbing up to the True Lord, peace is obtained.<br>
  Celestial peace comes; the Truth pleases me. How could these True Teachings ever be erased?<br>
  He Himself is Undeceivable; how could He ever be deceived by cleansing baths, charity, spiritual wisdom or ritual bathings?<br>
  Fraud, attachment and corruption are taken away, as are falsehood, hypocrisy and duality.<br>
  My mind is imbued with His Glorious Praises; I chant them, and He is pleasing to my mind. ||1||<br>
  So praise your Lord and Master, who created the creation.<br>
  Filth sticks to the polluted mind; how rare are those who drink in the Ambrosial Nectar.<br>
  Churn this Ambrosial Nectar, and drink it in; dedicate this mind to the Guru, and He will value it highly.<br>
  I intuitively realized my God, when I linked my mind to the True Lord.<br>
  I will sing the Lord's Glorious Praises with Him, if it pleases Him; how could I meet Him by being a stranger to Him?<br>
  So praise your Lord and Master, who created the creation. ||2||<br>
  When He comes, what else remains behind? How can there be any coming or going then?<br>
  When the mind is reconciled with its Beloved Lord, it is blended with Him.<br>
  True is the speech of one who is imbued with the Love of his Lord and Master, who fashioned the body fortress from a mere bubble.<br>
  He is the Master of the five elements; He Himself is the Creator Lord. He embellished the body with Truth.<br>
  I am worthless; please hear me, O my Beloved! Whatever pleases You is True.<br>
  One who is blessed with true understanding, does not come and go. ||3||<br>
  Apply such an ointment to your eyes, which is pleasing to your Beloved.<br>
  I realize, understand and know Him, only if He Himself causes me to know Him.<br>
  He Himself shows me the Way, and He Himself leads me to it, attracting my mind.<br>
  He Himself causes us to do good and bad deeds; who can know the value of the Mysterious Lord?<br>
  I know nothing of Tantric spells, magical mantras and hypocritical rituals; enshrining the Lord within my heart, my mind is satisfied.<br>
  The ointment of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is only understood by one who realizes the Lord, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||4||<br>
  I have my own friends; why should I go to the home of a stranger?<br>
  My friends are imbued with the True Lord; He is with them, in their minds.<br>
  In their minds, these friends celebrate in happiness; all good karma, righteousness and Dharma, the sixty-eight holy places of pilgrimage, charity and worship, are found in the love of the True Name.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 19 - Raag Soohee - Part 040</h2></center>
  He Himself creates, establishes and beholds all, by the Pleasure of His Will.<br>
  My friends are happy in the Love of the Lord; they nurture love for their Beloved. ||5||<br>
  If a blind man is made the leader, how will he know the way?<br>
  He is impaired, and his understanding is inadequate; how will he know the way?<br>
  How can he follow the path and reach the Mansion of the Lord's Presence? Blind is the understanding of the blind.<br>
  Without the Lord's Name, they cannot see anything; the blind are drowned in worldly entanglements.<br>
  Day and night, the Divine Light shines forth and joy wells up, when the Word of the Guru's Shabad abides in the mind.<br>
  With your palms pressed together, pray to the Guru to show you the way. ||6||<br>
  If the man becomes a stranger to God, then all the world becomes a stranger to him.<br>
  Unto whom should I tie up and give the bundle of my pains?<br>
  The whole world is overflowing with pain and suffering; who can know the state of my inner self?<br>
  Comings and goings are terrible and dreadful; there is no end to the rounds of reincarnation.<br>
  Without the Naam, he is vacant and sad; he does not listen to the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<br>
  If the mind becomes a stranger to God, then all the world becomes a stranger to him. ||7||<br>
  One who finds the Guru's Mansion within the home of his own being, merges in the All-pervading Lord.<br>
  The sevadar performs selfless service when he is pleased, and confirmed in the True Word of the Shabad.<br>
  Confirmed in the Shabad, with her being softened by devotion, the bride dwells in the Mansion of the Lord's Presence, deep within her being.<br>
  The Creator Himself creates; God Himself, in the end, is endless.<br>
  Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the mortal is united, and then embellished; the unstruck melody of the sound current resounds.<br>
  One who finds the Guru's Mansion within the home of his own being, merges in the All-pervading Lord. ||8||<br>
  Why praise that which is created? Praise instead the One who created it and watches over it.<br>
  His value cannot be estimated, no matter how much one may wish.<br>
  He alone can estimate the Lord's value, whom the Lord Himself causes to know. He is not mistaken; He does not make mistakes.<br>
  He alone celebrates victory, who is pleasing to You, through the Invaluable Word of the Guru's Shabad.<br>
  I am lowly and abject - I offer my prayer; may I never forsake the True Name, O Sibling of Destiny.<br>

  In this age, emancipation comes only from the Lord's Name.<br>
  Contemplative meditation on the Word of the Shabad emanates from the Guru.<br>
  Contemplating the Guru's Shabad, one comes to love the Lord's Name; he alone obtains it, unto whom the Lord shows Mercy.<br>
  In peace and poise, he sings the Lord's Praises day and night, and all sins are eradicated.<br>
  All are Yours, and You belong to all. I am Yours, and You are mine.<br>

  Vaar Of Soohee, With Shaloks Of The Third Mehl:<br>
  Shalok, Third Mehl:<br>
  In her red robes, the discarded bride goes out, seeking enjoyment with another's husband.<br>
  She leaves the husband of her own home, enticed by her love of duality.<br>
  She finds it sweet, and eats it up; her excessive sensuality only makes her disease worse.<br>
  She forsakes the Lord, her sublime Husband, and then later, she suffers the pain of separation from Him.<br>
  But she who becomes Gurmukh, turns away from corruption and adorns herself, attuned to the Love of the Lord.<br>
  She enjoys her celestial Husband Lord, and enshrines the Lord's Name within her heart.<br>
  She is humble and obedient; she is His virtuous bride forever; the Creator unites her with Himself.<br>
  O Nanak, she who has obtained the True Lord as her husband, is a happy soul-bride forever. ||1||<br>
  Third Mehl:<br>
  O meek, red-robed bride, keep your Husband Lord always in your thoughts.<br>
  O Nanak, your life shall be embellished, and your generations shall be saved along with you. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  He Himself established His throne, in the Akaashic ethers and the nether worlds.<br>
  By the Hukam of His Command, He created the earth, the true home of Dharma.<br>
  He Himself created and destroys; He is the True Lord, merciful to the meek.<br>
  You give sustenance to all; how wonderful and unique is the Hukam of Your Command!<br>
  You Yourself are permeating and pervading; You Yourself are the Cherisher. ||1||<br>
  Shalok, Third Mehl:<br>
  The red-robed woman becomes a happy soul-bride, only when she accepts the True Name.<br>
  Become pleasing to your True Guru, and you shall be totally beautified; otherwise, there is no place of rest.<br>
  So decorate yourself with the decorations that will never stain, and love the Lord day and night.<br>
  O Nanak, what is the character of the happy soul-bride? Within her, is Truth; her face is bright and radiant, and she is absorbed in her Lord and Master. ||1||<br>
  Third Mehl:<br>
  O people: I am in red, dressed in a red robe.<br>
  But my Husband Lord is not obtained by any robes; I have tried and tried, and given up wearing robes.<br>
  O Nanak, they alone obtain their Husband Lord, who listen to the Guru's Teachings.<br>
  Whatever pleases Him, happens. In this way, the Husband Lord is met. ||2||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 19 - Raag Soohee - Part 059</h2></center>
  Pauree:<br>
  By His Command, He created the creation, the world with its many species of beings.<br>
  I do not know how great Your Command is, O Unseen and Infinite True Lord.<br>
  You join some with Yourself; they reflect on the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<br>
  Those who are imbued with the True Lord are immaculate and pure; they conquer egotism and corruption.<br>
  He alone is united with You, whom You unite with Yourself; he alone is true. ||2||<br>
  Shalok, Third Mehl:<br>
  O red-robed woman, the whole world is red, engrossed in evil-mindedness and the love of duality.<br>
  In an instant, this falsehood totally vanishes; like the shade of a tree, it is gone.<br>
  The Gurmukh is the deepest crimson of crimson, dyed in the permanent color of the Lord's Love.<br>
  She turns away from Maya, and enters the celestial home of the Lord; the Ambrosial Name of the Lord dwells within her mind.<br>
  O Nanak, I am a sacrifice to my Guru; meeting Him, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||1||<br>
  Third Mehl:<br>
  The red color is vain and useless; it cannot help you obtain your Husband Lord.<br>
  This color does not take long to fade; she who loves duality, ends up a widow.<br>
  She who loves to wear her red dress is foolish and double-minded.<br>
  So make the True Word of the Shabad your red dress, and let the Fear of God, and the Love of God, be your ornaments and decorations.<br>
  O Nanak, she is a happy soul-bride forever, who walks in harmony with the Will of the True Guru. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  He Himself created Himself, and He Himself evaluates Himself.<br>
  His limits cannot be known; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, He is understood.<br>
  In the darkness of attachment to Maya, the world wanders in duality.<br>
  The self-willed manmukhs find no place of rest; they continue coming and going.<br>
  Whatever pleases Him, that alone happens. All walk according to His Will. ||3||<br>
  Shalok, Third Mehl:<br>
  The red-robed bride is vicious; she forsakes God, and cultivates love for another man.<br>
  She has neither modesty or self-discipline; the self-willed manmukh constantly tells lies, and is ruined by the bad karma of evil deeds.<br>
  She who has such pre-ordained destiny, obtains the True Guru has her Husband.<br>
  She discards all her red dresses, and wears the ornaments of mercy and forgiveness around her neck.<br>
  In this world and the next, she receives great honor, and the whole world worships her.<br>
  She who is enjoyed by her Creator Lord stands out, and does not blend in with the crowd.<br>
  O Nanak, the Gurmukh is the happy soul-bride forever; she has the Imperishable Lord God as her Husband. ||1||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  The red color is like a dream in the night; it is like a necklace without a string.<br>
  The Gurmukhs take on the permanent color, contemplating the Lord God.<br>
  O Nanak, with the supreme sublime essence of the Lord's Love, all sins and evil deeds are turned to ashes. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  He Himself created this world, and staged this wondrous play.<br>
  Into the body of the five elements, He infused attachment, falsehood and self-conceit.<br>
  The ignorant, self-willed manmukh comes and goes, wandering in reincarnation.<br>
  He Himself teaches some to become Gurmukh, through the spiritual wisdom of the Lord.<br>
  He blesses them with the treasure of devotional worship, and the wealth of the Lord's Name. ||4||<br>
  Shalok, Third Mehl:<br>
  O red-robed woman, discard your red dress, and then, you shall come to love your Husband Lord.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 19 - Raag Soohee - Part 060</h2></center>
  By wearing her red dress, no one has found her Husband Lord; the self-willed manmukh is burnt to death.<br>
  Meeting the True Guru, she discards her red dress, and eradicates egotism from within.<br>
  Her mind and body are imbued with the deep red color of His Love, and her tongue is imbued, singing His Praises and excellences.<br>
  She becomes His soul-bride forever, with the Word of the Shabad in her mind; she makes the Fear of God and the Love of God her ornaments and decorations.<br>
  O Nanak, by His Merciful Grace, she obtains the Mansion of the Lord's Presence, and keeps Him enshrined in her heart. ||1||<br>
  Third Mehl:<br>
  O bride, forsake your red dress, and decorate yourself with the crimson color of His Love.<br>
  Your comings and goings shall be forgotten, contemplating the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<br>
  The soul-bride is adorned and beautiful; the Celestial Lord, her Husband, abides in her home.<br>
  O Nanak, the bride ravishes and enjoys Him; and He, the Ravisher, ravishes and enjoys her. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  The foolish, self-willed manmukh is engrossed in false attachment to family.<br>
  Practicing egotism and self-conceit, he dies and departs, taking nothing along with him.<br>
  He does not understand that the Messenger of Death is hovering over his head; he is deluded by duality.<br>
  This opportunity will not come into his hands again; the Messenger of Death will seize him.<br>
  He acts according to his pre-ordained destiny. ||5||<br>
  Shalok, Third Mehl:<br>
  Do not call them 'satee', who burn themselves along with their husbands' corpses.<br>
  O Nanak, they alone are known as 'satee', who die from the shock of separation. ||1||<br>
  Third Mehl:<br>
  They are also known as 'satee', who abide in modesty and contentment.<br>
  They serve their Lord, and rise in the early hours to contemplate Him. ||2||<br>
  Third Mehl:<br>
  The widows burn themselves in the fire, along with their husbands' corpses.<br>
  If they truly knew their husbands, then they suffer terrible bodily pain.<br>
  O Nanak, if they did not truly know their husbands, why should they burn themselves in the fire?<br>
  Whether their husbands are alive or dead, those wives remain far away from them. ||3||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  You created pain along with pleasure; O Creator, such is the writ You have written.<br>
  There is no other gift as great as the Name; it has no form or sign.<br>
  The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is an inexhaustible treasure; it abides in the mind of the Gurmukh.<br>
  In His Mercy, He blesses us with the Naam, and then, the writ of pain and pleasure is not written.<br>
  Those humble servants who serve with love, meet the Lord, chanting the Chant of the Lord. ||6||<br>
  Shalok, Second Mehl:<br>
  They know that they will have to depart, so why do they make such ostentatious displays?<br>
  Those who do not know that they will have to depart, continue to arrange their affairs. ||1||<br>
  Second Mehl:<br>
  He accumulates wealth during the night of his life, but in the morning, he must depart.<br>
  O Nanak, it shall not go along with him, and so he regrets. ||2||<br>
  Second Mehl:<br>
  Paying a fine under pressure, does not bring either merit or goodness.<br>
  That alone is a good deed, O Nanak, which is done by one's own free will. ||3||<br>
  Second Mehl:<br>
  Stubborn-mindedness will not win the Lord to one's side, no matter how much it is tried.<br>
  The Lord is won over to your side, by offering Him your true love, O servant Nanak, and contemplating the Word of the Shabad. ||4||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  The Creator created the world; He alone understands it.<br>
  He Himself created the Universe, and He Himself shall destroy it afterwards.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 19 - Raag Soohee - Part 061</h2></center>
  All have grown weary of wandering throughout the four ages, but none know the Lord's worth.<br>
  The True Guru has shown me the One Lord, and my mind and body are at peace.<br>
  The Gurmukh praises the Lord forever; that alone happens, which the Creator Lord does. ||7||<br>
  Shalok, Second Mehl:<br>
  Those who have the Fear of God, have no other fears; those who do not have the Fear of God, are very afraid.<br>
  O Nanak, this mystery is revealed at the Court of the Lord. ||1||<br>
  Second Mehl:<br>
  That which flows, mingles with that which flows; that which blows, mingles with that which blows.<br>
  The living mingle with the living, and the dead mingle with the dead.<br>
  O Nanak, praise the One who created the creation. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  Those who meditate on the True Lord are true; they contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<br>
  They subdue their ego, purify their minds, and enshrine the Lord's Name within their hearts.<br>
  The fools are attached to their homes, mansions and balconies.<br>
  The self-willed manmukhs are caught in darkness; they do not know the One who created them.<br>
  He alone understands, whom the True Lord causes to understand; what can the helpless creatures do? ||8||<br>
  Shalok, Third Mehl:<br>
  O bride, decorate yourself, after you surrender and accept your Husband Lord.<br>
  Otherwise, your Husband Lord will not come to your bed, and your ornaments will be useless.<br>
  O bride, your decorations will adorn you, only when your Husband Lord's Mind is pleased.<br>
  Your ornaments will be acceptable and approved, only when your Husband Lord loves you.<br>
  So make the Fear of God your ornaments, joy your betel nuts to chew, and love your food.<br>
  Surrender your body and mind to your Husband Lord, and then, O Nanak, He will enjoy you. ||1||<br>
  Third Mehl:<br>
  The wife takes flowers, and fragrance of betel, and decorates herself.<br>
  But her Husband Lord does not come to her bed, and so these efforts are useless. ||2||<br>
  Third Mehl:<br>
  They are not said to be husband and wife, who merely sit together.<br>
  They alone are called husband and wife, who have one light in two bodies. ||3||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  Without the Fear of God, there is no devotional worship, and no love for the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<br>
  Meeting with the True Guru, the Fear of God wells up, and one is embellished with the Fear and the Love of God.<br>
  When the body and mind are imbued with the Lord's Love, egotism and desire are conquered and subdued.<br>
  The mind and body become immaculately pure and very beautiful, when one meets the Lord, the Destroyer of ego.<br>
  Fear and love all belong to Him; He is the True Lord, permeating and pervading the Universe. ||9||<br>
  Shalok, First Mehl:<br>
  Waaho! Waaho! You are wonderful and great, O Lord and Master; You created the creation, and made us.<br>
  You made the waters, waves, oceans, pools, plants, clouds and mountains.<br>
  You Yourself stand in the midst of what You Yourself created.<br>
  The selfless service of the Gurmukhs is approved; in celestial peace, they live the essence of reality.<br>
  They receive the wages of their labor, begging at the Door of their Lord and Master.<br>
  O Nanak, the Court of the Lord is overflowing and carefree; O my True Carefree Lord, no one returns empty-handed from Your Court. ||1||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  The teeth are like brilliant, beautiful pearls, and the eyes are like sparkling jewels.<br>
  Old age is their enemy, O Nanak; when they grow old, they waste away. ||2||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 19 - Raag Soohee - Part 062</h2></center>
  Pauree:<br>
  Praise the Lord, forever and ever; dedicate your body and mind to Him.<br>
  Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, I have found the True, Profound and Unfathomable Lord.<br>
  The Lord, the jewel of jewels, is permeating my mind, body and heart.<br>
  The pains of birth and death are gone, and I shall never again be consigned to the cycle of reincarnation.<br>
  O Nanak, praise the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the ocean of excellence. ||10||<br>
  Shalok, First Mehl:<br>
  O Nanak, burn this body; this burnt body has forgotten the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<br>
  The dirt is piling up, and in the world hereafter, your hand shall not be able to reach down into this stagnant pond to clean it out. ||1||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  O Nanak, wicked are the uncountable actions of the mind.<br>
  They bring terrible and painful retributions, but if the Lord forgives me, then I will be spared this punishment. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  True is the Command He sends forth, and True are the Orders He issues.<br>
  Forever unmoving and unchanging, permeating and pervading everywhere, He is the All-knowing Primal Lord.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, serve Him, through the True Insignia of the Shabad.<br>
  That which He makes is perfect; through the Guru's Teachings, enjoy His Love.<br>
  He is inaccessible, unfathomable and unseen; as Gurmukh, know the Lord. ||11||<br>
  Shalok, First Mehl:<br>
  O Nanak, the bags of coins are brought in<br>
  and placed in the Court of our Lord and Master, and there, the genuine and the counterfeit are separated. ||1||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  They go and bathe at sacred shrines of pilgrimage, but their minds are still evil, and their bodies are thieves.<br>
  Some of their filth is washed off by these baths, but they only accumulate twice as much.<br>
  Like a gourd, they may be washed off on the outside, but on the inside, they are still filled with poison.<br>
  The holy man is blessed, even without such bathing, while a thief is a thief, no matter how much he bathes. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  He Himself issues His Commands, and links the people of the world to their tasks.<br>
  He Himself joins some to Himself, and through the Guru, they find peace.<br>
  The mind runs around in the ten directions; the Guru holds it still.<br>
  Everyone longs for the Name, but it is only found through the Guru's Teachings.<br>
  Your pre-ordained destiny, written by the Lord in the very beginning, cannot be erased. ||12||<br>
  Shalok, First Mehl:<br>
  The two lamps light the fourteen markets.<br>
  There are just as many traders as there are living beings.<br>
  The shops are open, and trading is going on;<br>
  whoever comes there, is bound to depart.<br>
  The Righteous Judge of Dharma is the broker, who gives his sign of approval.<br>
  O Nanak, those who earn the profit of the Naam are accepted and approved.<br>
  And when they return home, they are greeted with cheers;<br>
  they obtain the glorious greatness of the True Name. ||1||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  Even when the night is dark, whatever is white retains its white color.<br>
  And even when the light of day is dazzlingly bright, whatever is black retains its black color.<br>
  The blind fools have no wisdom at all; their understanding is blind.<br>
  O Nanak, without the Lord's Grace, they will never receive honor. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  The True Lord Himself created the body-fortress.<br>
  Some are ruined through the love of duality, engrossed in egotism.<br>
  This human body is so difficult to obtain; the self-willed manmukhs suffer in pain.<br>
  He alone understands, whom the Lord Himself causes to understand; he is blessed by the True Guru.<br>
  He created the entire world for His play; He is pervading amongst all. ||13||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 19 - Raag Soohee - Part 063</h2></center>

  Thieves, adulterers, prostitutes and pimps, make friendships with the unrighteous, and eat with the unrighteous.<br>
  They do not know the value of the Lord's Praises, and Satan is always with them.<br>
  If a donkey is anointed with sandalwood paste, he still loves to roll in the dirt.<br>
  O Nanak, by spinning falsehood, a fabric of falsehood is woven.<br>
  False is the cloth and its measurement, and false is pride in such a garment. ||1||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  The callers to prayer, the flute-players, the horn-blowers, and also the singers<br>
  - some are givers, and some are beggars; they become acceptable only through Your Name, Lord.<br>
  O Nanak, I am a sacrifice to those who hear and accept the Name. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  Attachment to Maya is totally false, and false are those who go that way.<br>
  Through egotism, the world is caught in conflict and strife, and it dies.<br>
  The Gurmukh is free of conflict and strife, and sees the One Lord, pervading everywhere.<br>
  Recognizing that the Supreme Soul is everywhere, he crosses over the terrifying world-ocean.<br>
  His light merges into the Light, and he is absorbed into the Lord's Name. ||14||<br>
  Shalok: First Mehl:<br>
  O True Guru, bless me with Your charity; You are the All-powerful Giver.<br>
  May I subdue and quiet my egotism, pride, sexual desire, anger and self-conceit.<br>
  Burn away all my greed, and give me the Support of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<br>
  Day and night, keep me ever-fresh and new, spotless and pure; let me never be soiled by sin.<br>
  O Nanak, in this way I am saved; by Your Grace, I have found peace. ||1||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  There is only the one Husband Lord, for all who stand at His Door.<br>
  O Nanak, they ask for news of their Husband Lord, from those who are imbued with His Love. ||2||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  All are imbued with love for their Husband Lord; I am a discarded bride - what good am I?<br>
  My body is filled with so many faults; my Lord and Master does not even turn His thoughts to me. ||3||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  I am a sacrifice to those who praise the Lord with their mouths.<br>
  All the nights are for the happy soul-brides; I am a discarded bride - if only I could have even one night with Him! ||4||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  I am a beggar at Your Door, begging for charity; O Lord, please grant me Your Mercy, and give to me.<br>
  As Gurmukh, unite me, your humble servant, with You, that I may receive Your Name.<br>
  Then, the unstruck melody of the Shabad will vibrate and resound, and my light will blend with the Light.<br>
  Within my heart, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and celebrate the Word of the Lord's Shabad.<br>
  The Lord Himself is pervading and permeating the world; so fall in love with Him! ||15||<br>

  He receives hundreds and thousands of reprimands, day and night;<br>
  the swan-soul has renounced the Lord's Praises, and attached itself to a rotting carcass.<br>
  Cursed is that life, in which one only eats to fill his belly.<br>
  O Nanak, without the True Name, all one's friends turn to enemies. ||2||<br>

  The minstrel continually sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord, to embellish his life.<br>
  The Gurmukh serves and praises the True Lord, enshrining Him within his heart.<br>

  When the sun rises, the moon is not visible.<br>
  Wherever spiritual wisdom appears, ignorance is dispelled.<br>
  Reading the Vedas is the world's occupation;<br>
  the Pandits read them, study them and contemplate them.<br>
  Without understanding, all are ruined.<br>
  O Nanak, the Gurmukh is carried across. ||1||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  Those who do not savor the Word of the Shabad, do not love the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<br>
  They speak insipidly with their tongues, and are continually disgraced.<br>
  O Nanak, they act according to the karma of their past actions, which no one can erase. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  One who praises his God, receives honor.<br>
  He drives out egotism from within himself, and enshrines the True Name within his mind.<br>
  Through the True Word of the Guru's Bani, he chants the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and finds true peace.<br>
  He is united with the Lord, after being separated for so long; the Guru, the Primal Being, unites him with the Lord.<br>
  In this way, his filthy mind is cleansed and purified, and he meditates on the Name of the Lord. ||17||<br>

  With the fresh leaves of the body, and the flowers of virtue, Nanak has weaved his garland.<br>
  The Lord is pleased with such garlands, so why pick any other flowers? ||1||<br>

  O Nanak, it is the spring season for those, within whose homes their Husband Lord abides.<br>

  Of Kabeer<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Since your birth, what have you done?<br>
  You have never even chanted the Name of the Lord. ||1||<br>
  You have not meditated on the Lord; what thoughts are you attached to?<br>
  What preparations are you making for your death, O unfortunate one? ||1||Pause||<br>
  Through pain and pleasure, you have taken care of your family.<br>
  But at the time of death, you shall have to endure the agony all alone. ||2||<br>
  When you are seized by the neck, then you shall cry out.<br>
  Says Kabeer, why didn't you remember the Lord before this? ||3||1||<br>

  My innocent soul trembles and shakes.<br>
  I do not know how my Husband Lord will deal with me. ||1||<br>
  The night of my youth has passed away; will the day of old age also pass away?<br>
  My dark hairs, like bumble bees, have gone away, and grey hairs, like cranes, have settled upon my head. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Water does not remain in the unbaked clay pot;<br>
  when the soul-swan departs, the body withers away. ||2||<br>
  I decorate myself like a young virgin;<br>
  but how can I enjoy pleasures, without my Husband Lord? ||3||<br>
  My arm is tired, driving away the crows.<br>

  Soohee, Kabeer Jee:<br>
  Your time of service is at its end, and you will have to give your account.<br>
  The hard-hearted Messenger of Death has come to take you away.<br>
  What have you earned, and what have you lost?<br>
  Come immediately! You are summoned to His Court! ||1||<br>
  Get going! Come just as you are! You have been summoned to His Court.<br>
  The Order has come from the Court of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  I pray to the Messenger of Death: please, I still have some outstanding debts to collect in the village.<br>
  I will collect them tonight;<br>
  I will also pay you something for your expenses,<br>

  When he is awake, he is sleeping, and so he loses this life.<br>
  The property and wealth he has accumulated passes on to someone else.<br>
  Says Kabeer, those people are deluded,<br>
  who forget their Lord and Master, and roll in the dust. ||4||3||<br>

  Soohee, Kabeer Jee, Lallit:<br>
  My eyes are exhausted, and my ears are tired of hearing; my beautiful body is exhausted.<br>
  Driven forward by old age, all my senses are exhausted; only my attachment to Maya is not exhausted. ||1||<br>
  O mad man, you have not obtained spiritual wisdom and meditation.<br>
  You have wasted this human life, and lost. ||1||Pause||<br>
  O mortal, serve the Lord, as long as the breath of life remains in the body.<br>
  And even when your body dies, your love for the Lord shall not die; you shall dwell at the Feet of the Lord. ||2||<br>
  When the Word of the Shabad abides deep within, thirst and desire are quenched.<br>
  When one understands the Hukam of the Lord's Command, he plays the game of chess with the Lord; throwing the dice, he conquers his own mind. ||3||<br>
  Those humble beings, who know the Imperishable Lord and meditate on Him, are not destroyed at all.<br>
  Says Kabeer, those humble beings who know how to throw these dice, never lose the game of life. ||4||4||<br>
  Soohee, Lalit, Kabeer Jee:<br>
  In the one fortress of the body, there are five rulers, and all five demand payment of taxes.<br>
  I have not farmed anyone's land, so such payment is difficult for me to pay. ||1||<br>
  O people of the Lord, the tax-collector is constantly torturing me!<br>
  Raising my arms up, I complained to my Guru, and He has saved me. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The nine tax-assessors and the ten magistrates go out; they do not allow their subjects to live in peace.<br>
  They do not measure with a full tape, and they take huge amounts in bribes. ||2||<br>
  The One Lord is contained in the seventy-two chambers of the body, and He has written off my account.<br>
  The records of the Righteous Judge of Dharma have been searched, and I owe absolutely nothing. ||3||<br>
  Let no one slander the Saints, because the Saints and the Lord are as one.<br>
  Says Kabeer, I have found that Guru, whose Name is Clear Understanding. ||4||5||<br>
  Raag Soohee, The Word Of Sree Ravi Daas Jee:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  The happy soul-bride knows the worth of her Husband Lord.<br>
  Renouncing pride, she enjoys peace and pleasure.<br>
  She surrenders her body and mind to Him, and does not remain separate from Him.<br>
  She does not see or hear, or speak to another. ||1||<br>
  How can anyone know the pain of another,<br>
  if there is no compassion and sympathy within? ||1||Pause||<br>
  The discarded bride is miserable, and loses both worlds;<br>
  she does not worship her Husband Lord.<br>
  The bridge over the fire of hell is difficult and treacherous.<br>
  No one will accompany you there; you will have to go all alone. ||2||<br>
  Suffering in pain, I have come to Your Door, O Compassionate Lord.<br>
  I am so thirsty for You, but You do not answer me.<br>
  Says Ravi Daas, I seek Your Sanctuary, God;<br>
  as You know me, so will You save me. ||3||1||<br>
  SOOHEE:<br>
  That day which comes, that day shall go.<br>
  You must march on; nothing remains stable.<br>
  Our companions are leaving, and we must leave as well.<br>
  We must go far away. Death is hovering over our heads. ||1||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 19 - Raag Soohee - Part 067</h2></center>
  Why are you asleep? Wake up, you ignorant fool!<br>
  You believe that your life in the world is true. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The One who gave you life shall also provide you with nourishment.<br>
  In each and every heart, He runs His shop.<br>
  Meditate on the Lord, and renounce your egotism and self-conceit.<br>
  Within your heart, contemplate the Naam, the Name of the Lord, sometime. ||2||<br>
  Your life has passed away, but you have not arranged your path.<br>
  Evening has set in, and soon there will be darkness on all sides.<br>
  Says Ravi Daas, O ignorant mad-man,<br>
  don't you realize, that this world is the house of death?! ||3||2||<br>
  SOOHEE:<br>
  You may have lofty mansions, halls and kitchens.<br>
  But you cannot stay in them, even for an instant, after death. ||1||<br>
  This body is like a house of straw.<br>
  When it is burnt, it mixes with dust. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Even relatives, family and friends begin to say, "Take his body out, immediately!"||2||<br>
  And the wife of his house, who was so attached to his body and heart,<br>
  runs away, crying out, "Ghost! Ghost!"||3||<br>
  Says Ravi Daas, the whole world has been plundered,<br>
  but I have escaped, chanting the Name of the One Lord. ||4||3||<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Raag Soohee, The Word Of Shaykh Fareed Jee:<br>
  Burning and burning, writhing in pain, I wring my hands.<br>
  I have gone insane, seeking my Husband Lord.<br>
  O my Husband Lord, You are angry with me in Your Mind.<br>
  The fault is with me, and not with my Husband Lord. ||1||<br>
  O my Lord and Master, I do not know Your excellence and worth.<br>
  Having wasted my youth, now I come to regret and repent. ||1||Pause||<br>
  O black bird, what qualities have made you black?<br>
  "I have been burnt by separation from my Beloved."<br>
  Without her Husband Lord, how can the soul-bride ever find peace?<br>
  When He becomes merciful, then God unites us with Himself. ||2||<br>
  The lonely soul-bride suffers in the pit of the world.<br>
  She has no companions, and no friends.<br>
  In His Mercy, God has united me with the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.<br>
  And when I look again, then I find God as my Helper. ||3||<br>
  The path upon which I must walk is very depressing.<br>
  It is sharper than a two-edged sword, and very narrow.<br>
  That is where my path lies.<br>
  O Shaykh Fareed, think of that path early on. ||4||1||<br>
  SOOHEE, LALIT:<br>
  You were not able to make yourself a raft when you should have.<br>
  When the ocean is churning and over-flowing, then it is very difficult to cross over it. ||1||<br>
  Do not touch the safflower with your hands; its color will fade away, my dear. ||1||Pause||<br>
  First, the bride herself is weak, and then, her Husband Lord's Order is hard to bear.<br>
  Milk does not return to the breast; it will not be collected again. ||2||<br>
  Says Fareed, O my companions, when our Husband Lord calls,<br>
  the soul departs, sad at heart, and this body returns to dust. ||3||2||<br>
