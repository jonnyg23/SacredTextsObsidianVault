 <hr><center><h1>Shri Guru Granth Sahib: Raag Aasaa</h1></center>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 001</h2></center>
  One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. No Fear. No Hatred. Image Of The Undying. Beyond Birth. Self-Existent. By Guru's Grace:<br>
  Raag Aasaa, First Mehl, First House, So Dar ~ That Gate:<br>
  What is that Gate, and what is that Home, in which You sit and take care of all?<br>
  Countless musical instruments of so many various kinds vibrate there for You; so many are the musicians there for You.<br>
  There are so many Ragas there for You, along with their accompanying harmonies; so many minstrels sing to You.<br>
  The winds sing to You, as do water and fire; the Righteous Judge of Dharma sings at Your Door.<br>
  Chitar and Gupat, the recording angels of the conscious and the subconscious, sing to You; they know, and they write, and on the basis of what they write, the Lord of Dharma passes judgement.<br>
  Shiva and Brahma and the Goddess Parvaati, so beautiful and ever adorned by You, sing to You.<br>
  The Indras, seated upon their celestial thrones, with the deities at Your Gate, sing to You.<br>
  The Siddhas in Samaadhi sing to You, and the Holy Saints, in their contemplative meditation, sing to You.<br>
  The celibates, the truthful and the patient beings sing to You, and the mighty warriors sing to You.<br>
  The scholarly Pandits sing to You, along with the holy Rishis and the readers of the Vedas throughout the ages.<br>
  The Mohinis, the heavenly beauties who entice the heart in paradise, in this world and in the nether regions, sing to You.<br>
  The fourteen priceless jewels created by You, and the sixty-eight holy places of pilgrimage, sing to You.<br>
  The mighty warriors and the divine heroes sing to You, and the four sources of creation sing to You.<br>
  The continents, the worlds and the solar systems, created and installed by Your Hand, sing to You.<br>
  They alone sing to You, who are pleasing to Your Will, and who are imbued with the nectar of Your devotional worship.<br>
  So many others sing to You, they do not come into my mind; how can Nanak think of them?<br>
  That Lord and Master - He is True, forever True; He is True, and True is His Name.<br>
  He who created the creation is True, and He shall always be True; He shall not depart, even when the creation departs.<br>
  He created the world of Maya with its various colors and species.<br>
  Having created the creation, He Himself watches over it, as it pleases His Greatness.<br>
  Whatever pleases Him, that is what He does. No one can issue any commands to Him.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 002</h2></center>
  He is the King, the King of Kings, the Emperor of Kings! Nanak lives in surrender to His Will. ||1||1||<br>
  Aasaa, Fourth Mehl:<br>
  That Lord is Immaculate; the Lord God is Immaculate. The Lord is Unapproachable, Unfathomable and Incomparable.<br>
  All meditate, all meditate on You, O Dear Lord, O True Creator.<br>
  All beings are Yours; You are the Giver of all beings.<br>
  So meditate on the Lord, O Saints; He is the One who takes away all pain.<br>
  The Lord Himself is the Master, and He Himself is His own servant. O Nanak, how insignificant are mortal beings! ||1||<br>
  You are totally pervading within each and every heart; O Lord, You are the One Primal Being, All-permeating.<br>
  Some are givers, and some are beggars; all of this is Your wondrous play!<br>
  You Yourself are the Giver, and You Yourself are the Enjoyer. I know of no other than You.<br>
  You are the Supreme Lord God, Infinite and Eternal; what Glorious Praises of Yours should I speak and chant?<br>
  Unto those who serve, unto those who serve You, slave Nanak is a sacrifice. ||2||<br>
  Those who meditate on the Lord, those who meditate on You, O Dear Lord, those humble beings dwell in peace in this world.<br>
  They are liberated, they are liberated, who meditate on the Lord; the noose of Death is cut away from them.<br>
  Those who meditate on the Fearless One, on the Fearless Lord, all their fears are dispelled.<br>
  Those who have served, those who have served my Dear Lord, are absorbed into the Being of the Lord, Har, Har.<br>
  Blessed are they, blessed are they, who have meditated on the Dear Lord; slave Nanak is a sacrifice to them. ||3||<br>
  Devotion to You, devotion to You, is a treasure, overflowing, infinite and endless.<br>
  Your devotees, Your devotees praise You, O Dear Lord, in many and various ways.<br>
  For You, so many, for You, so very many, O Dear Lord, perform worship and adoration; they practice penance and endlessly chant in meditation.<br>
  For You, many - for You, so very many read the various Simritees and Shaastras; they perform religious rituals and the six ceremonies.<br>
  Those devotees, those devotees are good, O servant Nanak, who are pleasing to my Lord God. ||4||<br>
  You are the Primal Being, the Unrivalled Creator Lord; there is no other as Great as You.<br>
  You are the One, age after age; forever and ever, You are One and the same. You are the Eternal, Unchanging Creator.<br>
  Whatever pleases You comes to pass. Whatever You Yourself do, happens.<br>
  You Yourself created the entire Universe, and having done so, You Yourself shall destroy it all.<br>
  Servant Nanak sings the Glorious Praises of the Creator, the Knower of all. ||5||2||<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Raag Aasaa, First Mehl, Chaupaday, Second House:<br>
  Hearing, everyone calls You Great,<br>
  but only one who has seen You, knows just how Great You are.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 003</h2></center>
  No one can measure Your Worth, or describe You.<br>
  Those who describe You, remain absorbed in You. ||1||<br>
  O my Great Lord and Master of Unfathomable Depth, You are the Ocean of Excellence.<br>
  No one knows the greatness of Your expanse. ||1||Pause||<br>
  All the contemplators met together and practiced contemplation;<br>
  all the appraisers met together and tried to appraise You.<br>
  The theologians, the meditators and the teachers of teachers<br>
  could not express even an iota of Your Greatness. ||2||<br>
  All Truth, all austerities, all goodness,<br>
  and the greatness of the Siddhas, the beings of perfect spiritual powers<br>
  - without You, none has attained such spiritual powers.<br>
  They are obtained by Your Grace; their flow cannot be blocked. ||3||<br>
  What can the helpless speaker do?<br>
  Your bounties are overflowing with Your Praises.<br>
  And the one, unto whom You give - why should he think of any other?<br>
  O Nanak, the True Lord is the Embellisher. ||4||1||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl:<br>
  Chanting the Name, I live; forgetting it, I die.<br>
  It is so difficult to chant the True Name.<br>
  If someone feels hunger for the True Name,<br>
  then that hunger shall consume his pains. ||1||<br>
  So how could I ever forget Him, O my Mother?<br>
  True is the Master, and True is His Name. ||1||Pause||<br>
  People have grown weary of trying to appraise the greatness of the True Name, but they have not been able to appraise even an iota of it.<br>
  Even if they were all to meet together and recount them,<br>
  You would not be made any greater or lesser. ||2||<br>
  He does not die - there is no reason to mourn.<br>
  He continues to give, but His Provisions are never exhausted.<br>
  This Glorious Virtue is His alone - no one else is like Him;<br>
  there has never been anyone like Him, and there never shall be. ||3||<br>
  As Great as You Yourself are, so Great are Your Gifts.<br>
  It is You who created day and night as well.<br>
  Those who forget their Lord and Master are vile and despicable.<br>
  O Nanak, without the Name, people are wretched outcasts. ||4||2||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl:<br>
  If a beggar cries out at the door, the Master hears it in His Mansion.<br>
  Whether He receives him or pushes him away, it is the Gift of the Lord's Greatness. ||1||<br>
  Recognize the Lord's Light within all, and do not consider social class or status; there are no classes or castes in the world hereafter. ||1||Pause||<br>
  He Himself acts, and He Himself inspires us to act.<br>
  He Himself considers our complaints.<br>
  Since You, O Creator Lord, are the Doer,<br>
  why should I submit to the world? ||2||<br>
  You Yourself created and You Yourself give.<br>
  You Yourself eliminate evil-mindedness;<br>
  by Guru's Grace, You come to abide in our minds,<br>
  and then, pain and darkness are dispelled from within. ||3||<br>
  He Himself infuses love for the Truth.<br>
  Unto others, the Truth is not bestowed.<br>
  If He bestows it upon someone, says Nanak, then, in the world hereafter, that person is not called to account. ||4||3||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl:<br>
  The urges of the heart are like cymbals and ankle-bells;<br>
  the drum of the world resounds with the beat.<br>
  Naarad dances to the tune of the Dark Age of Kali Yuga;<br>
  where can the celibates and the men of truth place their feet? ||1||<br>
  Nanak is a sacrifice to the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<br>
  The world is blind; our Lord and Master is All-seeing. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The disciple feeds on the Guru;<br>
  out of love for bread, he comes to dwell in his home.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 004</h2></center>
  If one were to live and eat for hundreds of years,<br>
  that day alone would be auspicious, when he recognizes his Lord and Master. ||2||<br>
  Beholding the sight of the petitioner, compassion is not aroused.<br>
  No one lives without give and take.<br>
  The king administers justice only if his palm is greased.<br>
  No one is moved by the Name of God. ||3||<br>
  O Nanak, they are human beings in form and name only;<br>
  by their deeds they are dogs - this is the Command of the Lord's Court.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, if one sees himself as a guest in this world,<br>
  then he gains honor in the Court of the Lord. ||4||4||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl:<br>
  As much as the Shabad is in the mind, so much is Your melody; as much as the form of the universe is, so much is Your body, Lord.<br>
  You Yourself are the tongue, and You Yourself are the nose. Do not speak of any other, O my mother. ||1||<br>
  My Lord and Master is One;<br>
  He is the One and Only; O Siblings of Destiny, He is the One alone. ||1||Pause||<br>
  He Himself kills, and He Himself emancipates; He Himself gives and takes.<br>
  He Himself beholds, and He Himself rejoices; He Himself bestows His Glance of Grace. ||2||<br>
  Whatever He is to do, that is what He is doing. No one else can do anything.<br>
  As He projects Himself, so do we describe Him; this is all Your Glorious Greatness, Lord. ||3||<br>
  The Dark Age of Kali Yuga is the bottle of wine; Maya is the sweet wine, and the intoxicated mind continues to drink it in.<br>
  He Himself assumes all sorts of forms; thus poor Nanak speaks. ||4||5||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl:<br>
  Make your intellect your instrument, and love your tambourine;<br>
  thus bliss and lasting pleasure shall be produced in your mind.<br>
  This is devotional worship, and this is the practice of penance.<br>
  So dance in this love, and keep the beat with your feet. ||1||<br>
  Know that the perfect beat is the Praise of the Lord;<br>
  other dances produce only temporary pleasure in the mind. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Play the two cymbals of truth and contentment.<br>
  Let your ankle bells be the lasting Vision of the Lord.<br>
  Let your harmony and music be the elimination of duality.<br>
  So dance in this love, and keep the beat with your feet. ||2||<br>
  Let the fear of God within your heart and mind be your spinning dance,<br>
  and keep up, whether sitting or standing.<br>
  To roll around in the dust is to know that the body is only ashes.<br>
  So dance in this love, and keep the beat with your feet. ||3||<br>
  Keep the company of the disciples, the students who love the teachings.<br>
  As Gurmukh, listen to the True Name.<br>
  O Nanak, chant it, over and over again.<br>
  So dance in this love, and keep the beat with your feet. ||4||6||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl:<br>
  He created the air, and He supports the whole world; he bound water and fire together.<br>
  The blind, ten-headed Raavan had his heads cut off, but what greatness was obtained by killing him? ||1||<br>
  What Glories of Yours can be chanted?<br>
  You are totally pervading everywhere; You love and cherish all. ||1||Pause||<br>
  You created all beings, and You hold the world in Your Hands; what greatness is it to put a ring in the nose of the black cobra, as Krishna did?<br>
  Whose Husband are You? Who is Your wife? You are subtly diffused and pervading in all. ||2||<br>
  Brahma, the bestower of blessings, entered the stem of the lotus, with his relatives, to find the extent of the universe.<br>
  Proceeding on, he could not find its limits; what glory was obtained by killing Kansa, the king? ||3||<br>
  The jewels were produced and brought forth by churning the ocean of milk. The other gods proclaimed "We are the ones who did this!"<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 005</h2></center>
  Says Nanak, by hiding, how can the Lord be hidden? He has given each their share, one by one. ||4||7||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl:<br>
  The vine of good actions and character has spread out, and it bears the fruit of the Lord's Name.<br>
  The Name has no form or outline; it vibrates with the unstruck Sound Current; through the Word of the Shabad, the Immaculate Lord is revealed. ||1||<br>
  One can speak on this only when he knows it.<br>
  He alone drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Those who drink it in are enraptured; their bonds and shackles are cut away.<br>
  When one's light blends into the Divine Light, then the desire for Maya is ended. ||2||<br>
  Among all lights, I behold Your Form; all the worlds are Your Maya.<br>
  Among the tumults and forms, He sits in serene detachment; He bestows His Glance of Grace upon those who are engrossed in the illusion. ||3||<br>
  The Yogi who plays on the instrument of the Shabad gains the Blessed Vision of the Infinitely Beautiful Lord.<br>
  He, the Lord, is immersed in the Unstruck Shabad of the Word, says Nanak, the humble and meek. ||4||8||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl:<br>
  My virtue is that I carry the load of my words upon my head.<br>
  The real words are the Words of the Creator Lord.<br>
  How useless are eating, drinking and laughing,<br>
  if the Lord is not cherished in the heart! ||1||<br>
  Why should someone care for anything else,<br>
  if throughout his life, he gathers in that which is truly worth gathering? ||1||Pause||<br>
  The intellect of the mind is like a drunken elephant.<br>
  Whatever one utters is totally false, the most false of the false.<br>
  So what face should we put on to offer our prayer,<br>
  when both virtue and vice are close at hand as witnesses? ||2||<br>
  As You make us, so we become.<br>
  Without You, there is no other at all.<br>
  As is the understanding which You bestow, so do we receive.<br>
  As it pleases Your Will, so do You lead us. ||3||<br>
  The divine crystalline harmonies, their consorts, and their celestial families<br>
  - from them, the essence of Ambrosial Nectar is produced.<br>
  O Nanak, this is the wealth and property of the Creator Lord.<br>
  If only this essential reality were understood! ||4||9||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl:<br>
  When by His Grace He came to my home, then my companions met together to celebrate my marriage.<br>
  Beholding this play, my mind became blissful; my Husband Lord has come to marry me. ||1||<br>
  So sing - yes, sing the songs of wisdom and reflection, O brides.<br>
  My spouse, the Life of the world, has come into my home. ||1||Pause||<br>
  When I was married within the Gurdwara, the Guru's Gate, I met my Husband Lord, and I came to know Him.<br>
  The Word of His Shabad is pervading the three worlds; when my ego was quieted, my mind became happy. ||2||<br>
  He Himself arranges His own affairs; His affairs cannot be arranged by anyone else.<br>
  By the affair of this marriage, truth, contentment, mercy and faith are produced; but how rare is that Gurmukh who understands it! ||3||<br>
  Says Nanak, that Lord alone is the Husband of all.<br>
  She, upon whom He casts His Glance of Grace, becomes the happy soul-bride. ||4||10||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl:<br>
  Home and forest are the same, for one who dwells in the balance of intuitive peace and poise.<br>
  His evil-mindedness departs, and the Praises of God take its place.<br>
  To chant the True Name with one's mouth is the true ladder.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 006</h2></center>
  Serving the True Guru, one finds one's own place within the self. ||1||<br>
  To conquer the mind is the knowledge of the six Shaastras.<br>
  The Divine Light of the Lord God is perfectly pervading. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Excessive thirst for Maya makes people wear all sorts of religious robes.<br>
  The pain of corruption destroys the body's peace.<br>
  Sexual desire and anger steal the wealth of the self within.<br>
  But by abandoning duality, one is emancipated through the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||2||<br>
  In the Lord's Praise and adoration is intuitive peace, poise and bliss.<br>
  The Love of the Lord God is one's family and friends.<br>
  He Himself is the Doer, and He Himself is the Forgiver.<br>
  My body and mind belong to the Lord; my life is at His Command. ||3||<br>
  Falsehood and corruption cause terrible suffering.<br>
  All the religious robes and social classes look just like dust.<br>
  Whoever is born, continues to come and go.<br>
  O Nanak, only the Naam and the Lord's Command are eternal and everlasting. ||4||11||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl:<br>
  In the pool is the one incomparably beautiful lotus.<br>
  It blossoms continually; its form is pure and fragrant.<br>
  The swans pick up the bright jewels.<br>
  They take on the essence of the All-powerful Lord of the Universe. ||1||<br>
  Whoever is seen, is subject to birth and death.<br>
  In the pool without water, the lotus is not seen. ||1||Pause||<br>
  How rare are those who know and understand this secret.<br>
  The Vedas continually speak of the three branches.<br>
  One who merges into the knowledge of the Lord as absolute and related,<br>
  serves the True Guru and obtains the supreme status. ||2||<br>
  One who is imbued with the Love of the Lord and dwells continually upon Him is liberated.<br>
  He is the king of kings, and blossoms forth continually.<br>
  That one whom You preserve, by bestowing Your Mercy, O Lord,<br>
  even the sinking stone - You float that one across. ||3||<br>
  Your Light is pervading the three worlds; I know that You are permeating the three worlds.<br>
  When my mind turned away from Maya, I came to dwell in my own home.<br>
  Nanak falls at the feet of that person who immerses himself in the Lord's Love, and performs devotional worship night and day. ||4||12||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl:<br>
  Receiving the True Teachings from the Guru, arguments depart.<br>
  But through excessive cleverness, one is only plastered with dirt.<br>
  The filth of attachment is removed by the True Name of the Lord.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, one remains lovingly attached to the Lord. ||1||<br>
  He is the Presence Ever-present; offer your prayers to Him.<br>
  Pain and pleasure are in the Hands of God, the True Creator. ||1||Pause||<br>
  One who practices falsehood comes and goes.<br>
  By speaking and talking, His limits cannot be found.<br>
  Whatever one sees, is not understood.<br>
  Without the Name, satisfaction does not enter into the mind. ||2||<br>
  Whoever is born is afflicted by disease,<br>
  tortured by the pain of egotism and Maya.<br>
  They alone are saved, who are protected by God.<br>
  Serving the True Guru, they drink in the Amrit, the Ambrosial Nectar. ||3||<br>
  The unstable mind is restrained by tasting this Nectar.<br>
  Serving the True Guru, one comes to cherish the Ambrosial Nectar of the Shabad.<br>
  Through the True Word of the Shabad, the state of liberation is obtained.<br>
  O Nanak, self-conceit is eradicated from within. ||4||13||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl:<br>
  Whatever He has done, has proved to be true.<br>
  The True Guru bestows the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord.<br>
  With the Naam in the heart, the mind is not separated from the Lord.<br>
  Night and day, one dwells with the Beloved. ||1||<br>
  O Lord, please keep me in the Protection of Your Sanctuary.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 007</h2></center>
  By Guru's Grace, I have obtained the sublime essence of the Lord; I have received the wealth of the Naam and the nine treasures. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Those whose karma and Dharma - whose actions and faith - are in the True Name of the True Lord<br>
  - I am forever a sacrifice to them.<br>
  Those who are imbued with the Lord are accepted and respected.<br>
  In their company, the supreme wealth is obtained. ||2||<br>
  Blessed is that bride, who has obtained the Lord as her Husband.<br>
  She is imbued with the Lord, and she reflects upon the Word of His Shabad.<br>
  She saves herself, and saves her family and friends as well.<br>
  She serves the True Guru, and contemplates the essence of reality. ||3||<br>
  The True Name is my social status and honor.<br>
  The love of the Truth is my karma and Dharma - my faith and my actions, and my self-control.<br>
  O Nanak, one who is forgiven by the Lord is not called to account.<br>
  The One Lord erases duality. ||4||14||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl:<br>
  Some come, and after they come, they go.<br>
  Some are imbued with the Lord; they remain absorbed in Him.<br>
  Some find no place of rest at all, on the earth or in the sky.<br>
  Those who do not meditate on the Name of the Lord are the most unfortunate. ||1||<br>
  From the Perfect Guru, the way to salvation is obtained.<br>
  This world is a terrifying ocean of poison; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the Lord helps us cross over. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Those, whom God unites with Himself,<br>
  cannot be crushed by death.<br>
  The beloved Gurmukhs remain immaculately pure,<br>
  like the lotus in the water, which remains untouched. ||2||<br>
  Tell me: who should we call good or bad?<br>
  Behold the Lord God; the truth is revealed to the Gurmukh.<br>
  I speak the Unspoken Speech of the Lord, contemplating the Guru's Teachings.<br>
  I join the Sangat, the Guru's Congregation, and I find God's limits. ||3||<br>
  The Shaastras, the Vedas, the Simritees and all their many secrets;<br>
  bathing at the sixty-eight holy places of pilgrimage - all this is found by enshrining the sublime essence of the Lord in the heart.<br>
  The Gurmukhs are immaculately pure; no filth sticks to them.<br>
  O Nanak, the Naam, the Name of the Lord, abides in the heart, by the greatest pre-ordained destiny. ||4||15||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl:<br>
  Bowing down, again and again, I fall at the Feet of my Guru; through Him, I have seen the Lord, the Divine Self, within.<br>
  Through contemplation and meditation, the Lord dwells within the heart; see this, and understand. ||1||<br>
  So speak the Lord's Name, which shall emancipate you.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, the jewel of the Lord is found; ignorance is dispelled, and the Divine Light shines forth. ||1||Pause||<br>
  By merely saying it with the tongue, one's bonds are not broken, and egotism and doubt do not depart from within.<br>
  But when one meets the True Guru, egotism departs, and then, one realizes his destiny. ||2||<br>
  The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is sweet and dear to His devotees; it is the ocean of peace - enshrine it within the heart.<br>
  The Lover of His devotees, the Life of the World, the Lord bestows the Guru's Teachings upon the intellect, and one is emancipated. ||3||<br>
  One who dies fighting against his own stubborn mind finds God, and the desires of the mind are quieted.<br>
  O Nanak, if the Life of the World bestows His Mercy, one is intuitively attuned to the Love of the Lord. ||4||16||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl:<br>
  Unto whom do they speak? Unto whom do they preach? Who understands? Let them understand themselves.<br>
  Who do they teach? Through study, they come to realize the Lord's Glorious Virtues. Through the Shabad, the Word of the True Guru, they come to dwell in contentment. ||1||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 008</h2></center>
  Through the Guru's Teachings, realize that He is pervading in all bodies;<br>
  O my soul, vibrate on the Profound, Unfathomable Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Loving devotion to the Lord brings endless waves of joy and delight.<br>
  One who dwells with the Glorious Praises of the Lord, night and day, is sanctified.<br>
  The birth into the world of the faithless cynic is totally useless.<br>
  The humble devotee of the Lord remains unattached. ||2||<br>
  The body which sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord is sanctified.<br>
  The soul remains conscious of the Lord, absorbed in His Love.<br>
  The Lord is the Infinite Primal Being, beyond the beyond, the priceless jewel.<br>
  My mind is totally content, imbued with my Beloved. ||3||<br>
  Those who speak and babble on and on, are truly dead.<br>
  God is not far away - O God, You are right here.<br>
  I have seen that the whole world is engrossed in Maya.<br>
  O Nanak, through the Guru's Teachings, I meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||4||17||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl, Ti-Tukas:<br>
  One is a beggar, living on charity;<br>
  another is a king, absorbed in himself.<br>
  One receives honor, and another dishonor.<br>
  The Lord destroys and creates; He is enshrined in His meditation.<br>
  There is no other as great as You.<br>
  So whom should I present to You? Who is good enough? ||1||<br>
  The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is my only Support.<br>
  You are the Great Giver, the Doer, the Creator. ||1||Pause||<br>
  I have not walked on Your Path; I have followed the crooked path.<br>
  In the Court of the Lord, I find no place to sit.<br>
  I am mentally blind, in the bondage of Maya.<br>
  The wall of my body is breaking down, wearing away, growing weaker.<br>
  You have such high hopes of eating and living<br>
  - your breaths and morsels of food are already counted! ||2||<br>
  Night and day they are blind - please, bless them with Your Light.<br>
  They are drowning in the terrifying world-ocean, crying out in pain.<br>
  I am a sacrifice to those who chant, hear and believe in the Name.<br>
  Nanak utters this one prayer;<br>
  soul and body, all belong to You, Lord. ||3||<br>
  When You bless me, I chant Your Name.<br>
  Thus I find my seat in the Court of the Lord.<br>
  When it pleases You, evil-mindedness departs,<br>
  and the jewel of spiritual wisdom comes to dwell in the mind.<br>
  When the Lord bestows His Glance of Grace, then one comes to meet the True Guru.<br>
  Prays Nanak, carry us across the terrifying world-ocean. ||4||18||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl, Panch-Padas:<br>
  A cow without milk; a bird without wings; a garden without water - totally useless!<br>
  What is an emperor, without respect? The chamber of the soul is so dark, without the Name of the Lord. ||1||<br>
  How could I ever forget You? It would be so painful!<br>
  I would suffer such pain - no, I shall not forget You! ||1||Pause||<br>
  The eyes grow blind, the tongue does not taste, and the ears do not hear any sound.<br>
  He walks on his feet only when supported by someone else; without serving the Lord, such are the fruits of life. ||2||<br>
  The Word is the tree; the garden of the heart is the farm; tend it, and irrigate it with the Lord's Love.<br>
  All these trees bear the fruit of the Name of the One Lord; but without the karma of good actions, how can anyone obtain it? ||3||<br>
  As many living beings are there are, they are all Yours. Without selfless service, no one obtains any reward.<br>
  Pain and pleasure come by Your Will; without the Name, the soul does not even exist. ||4||<br>
  To die in the Teachings is to live. Otherwise, what is life? That is not the way.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 009</h2></center>
  Says Nanak, He grants life to the living beings; O Lord, please keep me according to Your Will. ||5||19||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl:<br>
  Let the body be the Brahmin, and let the mind be the loin-cloth;<br>
  let spiritual wisdom be the sacred thread, and meditation the ceremonial ring.<br>
  I seek the Name of the Lord and His Praise as my cleansing bath.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, I am absorbed into God. ||1||<br>
  O Pandit, O religious scholar, contemplate God in such a way<br>
  that His Name may sanctify you, that His Name may be your study, and His Name your wisdom and way of life. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The outer sacred thread is worthwhile only as long as the Divine Light is within.<br>
  So make the remembrance of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, your loin-cloth and the ceremonial mark on your forehead.<br>
  Here and hereafter, the Name alone shall stand by you.<br>
  Do not seek any other actions, except the Name. ||2||<br>
  Worship the Lord in loving adoration, and burn your desire for Maya.<br>
  Behold only the One Lord, and do not seek out any other.<br>
  Become aware of reality, in the Sky of the Tenth Gate;<br>
  read aloud the Lord's Word, and contemplate it. ||3||<br>
  With the diet of His Love, doubt and fear depart.<br>
  With the Lord as your night watchman, no thief will dare to break in.<br>
  Let the knowledge of the One God be the ceremonial mark on your forehead.<br>
  Let the realization that God is within you be your discrimination. ||4||<br>
  Through ritual actions, God cannot be won over;<br>
  by reciting sacred scriptures, His value cannot be estimated.<br>
  The eighteen Puraanas and the four Vedas do not know His mystery.<br>
  O Nanak, the True Guru has shown me the Lord God. ||5||20||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl:<br>
  He alone is the selfless servant, slave and humble devotee,<br>
  who as Gurmukh, becomes the slave of his Lord and Master.<br>
  He, who created the Universe, shall ultimately destroy it.<br>
  Without Him, there is no other at all. ||1||<br>
  Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the Gurmukh reflects upon the True Name; in the True Court, he is found to be true. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The true supplication, the true prayer<br>
  - within the Mansion of His Sublime Presence, the True Lord Master hears and applauds these.<br>
  He summons the truthful to His Heavenly Throne<br>
  and bestows glorious greatness upon them; that which He wills, comes to pass. ||2||<br>
  The Power is Yours; You are my only Support.<br>
  The Word of the Guru's Shabad is my true password.<br>
  One who obeys the Hukam of the Lord's Command, goes to Him openly.<br>
  With the password of truth, his way is not blocked. ||3||<br>
  The Pandit reads and expounds on the Vedas,<br>
  but he does not know the secret of the thing within himself.<br>
  Without the Guru, understanding and realization are not obtained;<br>
  but still God is True, pervading everywhere. ||4||<br>
  What should I say, or speak or describe?<br>
  Only You Yourself know, O Lord of total wonder.<br>
  Nanak takes the Support of the Door of the One God.<br>
  There, at the True Door, the Gurmukhs sustain themselves. ||5||21||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl:<br>
  The clay pitcher of the body is miserable; it suffers in pain through birth and death.<br>
  How can this terrifying world-ocean be crossed over? Without the Lord - Guru, it cannot be crossed. ||1||<br>
  Without You, there is no other at all, O my Beloved; without you, there is no other at all.<br>
  You are in all colors and forms; he alone is forgiven, upon whom You bestow Your Glance of Grace. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Maya, my mother-in-law, is evil; she does not let me live in my own home. The vicious one does not let me meet with my Husband Lord.<br>
  I serve at the feet of my companions and friends; the Lord has showered me with His Mercy, through Guru's Grace. ||2||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 010</h2></center>
  Reflecting upon my self, and conquering my mind, I have seen that there is no other friend like You.<br>
  As You keep me, so do I live. You are the Giver of peace and pleasure. Whatever You do, comes to pass. ||3||<br>
  Hope and desire have both been dispelled; I have renounced my longing for the three qualities.<br>
  The Gurmukh obtains the state of ecstasy, taking to the Shelter of the Saints' Congregation. ||4||<br>
  All wisdom and meditation, all chanting and penance, come to one whose heart is filled with the Invisible, Inscrutable Lord.<br>
  O Nanak, one whose mind is imbued with the Lord's Name, finds the Guru's Teachings, and intuitively serves. ||5||22||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl, Panch-Padas:<br>
  Your attachment to your family, your attachment to all your affairs<br>
  - renounce all your attachments, for they are all corrupt. ||1||<br>
  Renounce your attachments and doubts, O brother,<br>
  and dwell upon the True Name within your heart and body. ||1||Pause||<br>
  When one receives the nine treasures of the True Name,<br>
  his children do not weep, and his mother does not grieve. ||2||<br>
  In this attachment, the world is drowning.<br>
  Few are the Gurmukhs who swim across. ||3||<br>
  In this attachment, people are reincarnated over and over again.<br>
  Attached to emotional attachment, they go to the city of Death. ||4||<br>
  You have received the Guru's Teachings - now practice meditation and penance.<br>
  If attachment is not broken, no one is approved. ||5||<br>
  But if He bestows His Glance of Grace, then this attachment departs.<br>
  O Nanak, then one remains merged in the Lord. ||6||23||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl:<br>
  He Himself does everything, the True, Invisible, Infinite Lord.<br>
  I am a sinner, You are the Forgiver. ||1||<br>
  By Your Will, everything come to pass.<br>
  One who acts in stubborn-mindedness is ruined in the end. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The intellect of the self-willed manmukh is engrossed in falsehood.<br>
  Without the meditative remembrance of the Lord, it suffers in sin. ||2||<br>
  Renounce evil-mindedness, and you shall reap the rewards.<br>
  Whoever is born, comes through the Unknowable and Mysterious Lord. ||3||<br>
  Such is my Friend and Companion;<br>
  meeting with the Guru, the Lord, devotion was implanted within me. ||4||<br>
  In all other transactions, one suffers loss.<br>
  The Name of the Lord is pleasing to Nanak's mind. ||5||24||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl, Chau-Padas:<br>
  Contemplate and reflect upon knowledge, and you will become a benefactor to others.<br>
  When you conquer the five passions, then you shall come to dwell at the sacred shrine of pilgrimage. ||1||<br>
  You shall hear the vibrations of the tinkling bells, when your mind is held steady.<br>
  So what can the Messenger of Death do to me hereafter? ||1||Pause||<br>
  When you abandon hope and desire, then you become a true Sannyaasi.<br>
  When the Yogi practices abstinence, then he enjoys his body. ||2||<br>
  Through compassion, the naked hermit reflects upon his inner self.<br>
  He slays his own self, instead of slaying others. ||3||<br>
  You, O Lord, are the One, but You have so many Forms.<br>
  Nanak does not know Your wondrous plays. ||4||25||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl:<br>
  I am not stained by only one sin, that could be washed clean by virtue.<br>
  My Husband Lord is awake, while I sleep through the entire night of my life. ||1||<br>
  In this way, how can I become dear to my Husband Lord?<br>
  My Husband Lord remains awake, while I sleep through the entire night of my life. ||1||Pause||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 011</h2></center>
  With hope and desire, I approach His Bed,<br>
  but I do not know whether He will be pleased with me or not. ||2||<br>
  How do I know what will happen to me, O my mother?<br>
  Without the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan, I cannot survive. ||1||Pause||<br>
  I have not tasted His Love, and my thirst is not quenched.<br>
  My beautiful youth has run away, and now I, the soul-bride, repent and regret. ||3||<br>
  Even now, I am held by hope and desire.<br>
  I am depressed; I have no hope at all. ||1||Pause||<br>
  She overcomes her egotism, and adorns herself;<br>
  the Husband Lord now ravishes and enjoys the soul-bride on His Bed. ||4||<br>
  Then, O Nanak, the bride becomes pleasing to the Mind of her Husband Lord;<br>
  she sheds her self-conceit, and is absorbed in her Lord and Master. ||1||Pause||26||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl:<br>
  In this world of my father's house, I, the soul-bride, have been very childish;<br>
  I did not realize the value of my Husband Lord. ||1||<br>
  My Husband is the One; there is no other like Him.<br>
  If He bestows His Glance of Grace, then I shall meet Him. ||1||Pause||<br>
  In the next world of my in-law's house, I, the the soul-bride, shall realize Truth;<br>
  I shall come to know the celestial peace of my Husband Lord. ||2||<br>
  By Guru's Grace, such wisdom comes to me,<br>
  so that the soul-bride becomes pleasing to the Mind of the Husband Lord. ||3||<br>
  Says Nanak, she who adorns herself with the Love and the Fear of God,<br>
  enjoys her Husband Lord forever on His Bed. ||4||27||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl:<br>
  No one is anyone else's son, and no one is anyone else's mother.<br>
  Through false attachments, people wander around in doubt. ||1||<br>
  O My Lord and Master, I am created by You.<br>
  If You give it to me, I will chant Your Name. ||1||Pause||<br>
  That person who is filled with all sorts of sins may pray at the Lord's Door,<br>
  but he is forgiven only when the Lord so wills. ||2||<br>
  By Guru's Grace, evil-mindedness is destroyed.<br>
  Wherever I look, there I find the One Lord. ||3||<br>
  Says Nanak, if one comes to such an understanding,<br>
  then he is absorbed into the Truest of the True. ||4||28||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl, Du-Padas:<br>
  In that pool of the world, the people have their homes; there, the Lord has created water and fire.<br>
  In the mud of earthly attachment, their feet have become mired, and I have seen them drowning there. ||1||<br>
  O foolish people, why don't you remember the One Lord?<br>
  Forgetting the Lord, your virtues shall wither away. ||1||Pause||<br>
  I am not a celibate, nor am I truthful, nor a scholar; I was born foolish and ignorant.<br>
  Prays Nanak, I seek the Sanctuary of those who do not forget You, Lord. ||2||29||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl:<br>
  There are six systems of philosophy, six teachers, and six doctrines;<br>
  but the Teacher of teachers is the One Lord, who appears in so many forms. ||1||<br>
  That system, where the Praises of the Creator are sung<br>
  - follow that system; in it rests greatness. ||1||Pause||<br>
  As the seconds, minutes, hours, days, weekdays months and seasons all originate from the one sun,<br>
  O Nanak, so do all forms originate from the One Creator. ||2||30||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 012</h2></center>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Aasaa, Third House, First Mehl:<br>
  You may have thousands of armies, thousands of marching bands and lances, and thousands of men to rise and salute you.<br>
  Your rule may extend over thousands of miles, and thousands of men may rise to honor you.<br>
  But, if your honor is of no account to the Lord, then all of your ostentatious show is useless. ||1||<br>
  Without the Name of the Lord, the world is in turmoil.<br>
  Even though the fool may be taught again and again, he remains the blindest of the blind. ||1||Pause||<br>
  You may earn thousands, collect thousands, and spend thousands of dollars; thousands may come, and thousands may go.<br>
  But, if your honor is of no account to the Lord, then where will you go to find a safe haven? ||2||<br>
  Thousands of Shaastras may be explained to the mortal, and thousands of Pandits may read the Puraanas to him;<br>
  but, if his honor is of no account to the Lord, then all of this is unacceptable. ||3||<br>
  Honor comes from the True Name, the Name of the Merciful Creator.<br>
  If it abides in the heart, day and night, O Nanak, then the mortal shall swim across, by His Grace. ||4||1||31||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl:<br>
  The One Name is my lamp; I have put the oil of suffering into it.<br>
  Its flame has dried up this oil, and I have escaped my meeting with the Messenger of Death. ||1||<br>
  O people, do not make fun of me.<br>
  Thousands of wooden logs, piled up together, need only a tiny flame to burn. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The Lord is my festive dish, of rice balls on leafy plates; the True Name of the Creator Lord is my funeral ceremony.<br>
  Here and hereafter, in the past and in the future, this is my support. ||2||<br>
  The Lord's Praise is my River Ganges and my city of Benares; my soul takes its sacred cleansing bath there.<br>
  That becomes my true cleansing bath, if night and day, I enshrine love for You. ||3||<br>
  The rice balls are offered to the gods and the dead ancestors, but it is the Brahmins who eat them!<br>
  O Nanak, the rice balls of the Lord are a gift which is never exhausted. ||4||2||32||<br>
  Aasaa, Fourth House, First Mehl:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  The Gods, yearning for the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan, suffered through pain and hunger at the sacred shrines.<br>
  The yogis and the celibates live their disciplined lifestyle, while others wear saffron robes and become hermits. ||1||<br>
  For Your sake, O Lord Master, they are imbued with love.<br>
  Your Names are so many, and Your Forms are endless. No one can tell how may Glorious Virtues You have. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Leaving behind hearth and home, palaces, elephants, horses and native lands, mortals have journeyed to foreign lands.<br>
  The spiritual leaders, prophets, seers and men of faith renounced the world, and became acceptable. ||2||<br>
  Renouncing tasty delicacies, comfort, happiness and pleasures, some have abandoned their clothes and now wear skins.<br>
  Those who suffer in pain, imbued with Your Name, have become beggars at Your Door. ||3||<br>
  Some wear skins, and carry begging bowls, bearing wooden staffs, and sitting on deer skins. Others raise their hair in tufts and wear sacred threads and loin-cloths.<br>
  You are the Lord Master, I am just Your puppet. Prays Nanak, what is my social status to be? ||4||1||33||<br>

  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  The five evil passions dwell hidden within the mind.<br>
  They do not remain still, but move around like wanderers. ||1||<br>
  My soul does not stay held by the Merciful Lord.<br>
  It is greedy, deceitful, sinful and hypocritical, and totally attached to Maya. ||1||Pause||<br>
  I will decorate my neck with garlands of flowers.<br>
  When I meet my Beloved, then I will put on my decorations. ||2||<br>
  I have five companions and one Spouse.<br>
  It is ordained from the very beginning, that the soul must ultimately depart. ||3||<br>
  The five companions will lament together.<br>
  When the soul is trapped, prays Nanak, it is called to account. ||4||1||34||<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Aasaa, Sixth House, First Mehl:<br>
  If the pearl of the mind is strung like a jewel on the thread of the breath,<br>
  and the soul-bride adorns her body with compassion, then the Beloved Lord will enjoy His lovely bride. ||1||<br>
  O my Love, I am fascinated by Your many glories;<br>
  Your Glorious Virtues are not found in any other. ||1||Pause||<br>
  If the bride wears the garland of the Lord's Name, Har, Har, around her neck, and if she uses the toothbrush of the Lord;<br>
  and if she fashions and wears the bracelet of the Creator Lord around her wrist, then she shall hold her consciousness steady. ||2||<br>
  She should make the Lord, the Slayer of demons, her ring, and take the Transcendent Lord as her silken clothes.<br>
  The soul-bride should weave patience into the braids of her hair, and apply the lotion of the Lord, the Great Lover. ||3||<br>
  If she lights the lamp in the mansion of her mind, and makes her body the bed of the Lord,<br>
  then, when the King of spiritual wisdom comes to her bed, He shall take her, and enjoy her. ||4||1||35||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl:<br>
  The created being acts as he is made to act; what can be said to him, O Siblings of Destiny?<br>
  Whatever the Lord is to do, He is doing; what cleverness could be used to affect Him? ||1||<br>
  The Order of Your Will is so sweet, O Lord; this is pleasing to You.<br>
  O Nanak, he alone is honored with greatness, who is absorbed in the True Name. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The deeds are done according to pre-ordained destiny; no one can turn back this Order.<br>
  As it is written, so it comes to pass; no one can erase it. ||2||<br>
  He who talks on and on in the Lord's Court is known as a joker.<br>
  He is not successful in the game of chess, and his chessmen do not reach their goal. ||3||<br>
  By himself, no one is literate, learned or wise; no one is ignorant or evil.<br>
  When, as a slave, one praises the Lord, only then is he known as a human being. ||4||2||36||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl:<br>
  Let the Word of the Guru's Shabad be the ear-rings in your mind, and wear the patched coat of tolerance.<br>
  Whatever the Lord does, look upon that as good; thus you shall obtain the treasure of Sehj Yoga. ||1||<br>

  O father, the soul which is united in union as a Yogi, remains united in the supreme essence throughout the ages.<br>
  One who has obtained the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Immaculate Lord - his body enjoys the pleasure of spiritual wisdom. ||1||Pause||<br>
  In the Lord's City, he sits in his Yogic posture, and he forsakes his desires and conflicts.<br>
  The sound of the horn ever rings out its beautiful melody, and day and night, he is filled with the sound current of the Naad. ||2||<br>
  My cup is reflective meditation, and spiritual wisdom is my walking stick; to dwell in the Lord's Presence is the ashes I apply to my body.<br>
  The Praise of the Lord is my occupation; and to live as Gurmukh is my pure religion. ||3||<br>
  My arm-rest is to see the Lord's Light in all, although their forms and colors are so numerous.<br>
  Says Nanak, listen, O Bharthari Yogi: love only the Supreme Lord God. ||4||3||37||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl:<br>
  Make spiritual wisdom your molasses, and meditation your scented flowers; let good deeds be the herbs.<br>
  Let devotional faith be the distilling fire, and your love the ceramic cup. Thus the sweet nectar of life is distilled. ||1||<br>
  O Baba, the mind is intoxicated with the Naam, drinking in its Nectar. It remains absorbed in the Lord's Love.<br>
  Night and day, remaining attached to the Love of the Lord, the celestial music of the Shabad resounds. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The Perfect Lord naturally gives the cup of Truth, to the one upon whom He casts His Glance of Grace.<br>
  One who trades in this Nectar - how could he ever love the wine of the world? ||2||<br>
  The Teachings of the Guru, the Ambrosial Bani - drinking them in, one becomes acceptable and renowned.<br>
  Unto the one who loves the Lord's Court, and the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, of what use is liberation or paradise? ||3||<br>
  Imbued with the Lord's Praises, one is forever a Bairaagee, a renunciate, and one's life is not lost in the gamble.<br>
  Says Nanak, listen, O Bharthari Yogi: drink in the intoxicating nectar of the Lord. ||4||4||38||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl:<br>
  Having attacked Khuraasaan, Baabar terrified Hindustan.<br>
  The Creator Himself does not take the blame, but has sent the Mugal as the messenger of death.<br>
  There was so much slaughter that the people screamed. Didn't You feel compassion, Lord? ||1||<br>
  O Creator Lord, You are the Master of all.<br>
  If some powerful man strikes out against another man, then no one feels any grief in their mind. ||1||Pause||<br>
  But if a powerful tiger attacks a flock of sheep and kills them, then its master must answer for it.<br>
  This priceless country has been laid waste and defiled by dogs, and no one pays any attention to the dead.<br>
  You Yourself unite, and You Yourself separate; I gaze upon Your Glorious Greatness. ||2||<br>
  One may give himself a great name, and revel in the pleasures of the mind,<br>
  but in the Eyes of the Lord and Master, he is just a worm, for all the corn that he eats.<br>
  Only one who dies to his ego while yet alive, obtains the blessings, O Nanak, by chanting the Lord's Name. ||3||5||39||<br>
  Raag Aasaa, Second House, Third Mehl:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  The Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan is obtained by great good fortune.<br>
  Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, true detachment is obtained.<br>
  The six systems of philosophy are pervasive,<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 015</h2></center>
  but the Guru's system is profound and unequalled. ||1||<br>
  The Guru's system is the way to liberation.<br>

  Through the Guru's system, the world is saved,<br>
  if it is embraced with love and affection.<br>
  How rare is that person who truly loves the Guru's Way.<br>
  Through the Guru's system, everlasting peace is obtained. ||2||<br>
  Through the Guru's system, the Door of Salvation is obtained.<br>
  Serving the True Guru, one's family is saved.<br>
  There is no salvation for those who have no Guru.<br>
  Beguiled by worthless sins, they are struck down. ||3||<br>
  Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the body finds peace and tranquility.<br>
  The Gurmukh is not afflicted by pain.<br>
  The Messenger of Death does not come near him.<br>
  O Nanak, the Gurmukh is absorbed in the True Lord. ||4||1||40||<br>
  Aasaa, Third Mehl:<br>
  One who dies in the Word of the Shabad, eradicates his self-conceit from within.<br>
  He serves the True Guru, with no iota of self-interest.<br>
  The Fearless Lord, the Great Giver, ever abides in his mind.<br>
  The True Bani of the Word is obtained only by good destiny. ||1||<br>
  So gather merits, and let your demerits depart from within you.<br>
  You shall be absorbed into the Shabad, the Word of the Perfect Guru. ||1||Pause||<br>
  One who purchases merits, knows the value of these merits.<br>
  He chants the Ambrosial Nectar of the Word, and the Name of the Lord.<br>
  Through the True Bani of the Word, he becomes pure.<br>
  Through merit, the Name is obtained. ||2||<br>
  The invaluable merits cannot be acquired.<br>
  The pure mind is absorbed into the True Word of the Shabad.<br>
  How very fortunate are those who meditate on the Naam,<br>
  and ever enshrine in their minds the Lord, the Giver of merit. ||3||<br>
  I am a sacrifice to those who gather merits.<br>
  At the Gate of Truth, I sing the Glorious Praises of the True One.<br>
  He Himself spontaneously bestows His gifts.<br>
  O Nanak, the value of the Lord cannot be described. ||4||2||41||<br>
  Aasaa, Third Mehl:<br>
  Great is the greatness of the True Guru;<br>
  He merges in His Merger, those who have been separated for so long.<br>
  He Himself merges the merged in His Merger.<br>
  He Himself knows His own worth. ||1||<br>
  How can anyone appraise the Lord's worth?<br>
  Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, one may merge with the Infinite, Unapproachable and Incomprehensible Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Few are the Gurmukhs who know His worth.<br>
  How rare are those who receive the Lord's Grace.<br>
  Through the Sublime Bani of His Word, one becomes sublime.<br>
  The Gurmukh chants the Word of the Shabad. ||2||<br>
  Without the Name, the body suffers in pain;<br>
  but when one meets the True Guru, then that pain is removed.<br>
  Without meeting the Guru, the mortal earns only pain.<br>
  The self-willed manmukh receives only more punishment. ||3||<br>
  The essence of the Lord's Name is so very sweet;<br>
  he alone drinks it, whom the Lord causes to drink it.<br>

  One who has tasted the Shabad, obtains the true flavor.<br>
  The Name of the Lord abides within his mind.<br>
  The Lord God is Eternal and All-pervading.<br>
  He Himself is near, and He Himself is far away. ||2||<br>
  Everyone talks and speaks through speech;<br>
  the Lord Himself forgives, and unites us with Himself.<br>
  By merely speaking and talking, He is not obtained.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, He comes to abide in the mind. ||3||<br>
  The Gurmukh eradicates his self-conceit from within.<br>
  He is imbued with the Lord's Love, having discarded worldly attachment.<br>
  He contemplates the utterly Immaculate Word of the Guru's Shabad.<br>
  O Nanak, the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is our Salvation. ||4||4||43||<br>
  Aasaa, Third Mehl:<br>
  Attached to the love of duality, one only incurs pain.<br>
  Without the Word of the Shabad, one's life is wasted away in vain.<br>

  and then, one is not attached to the love of duality. ||1||<br>
  Those who hold fast to their roots, become acceptable.<br>
  Night and day, they meditate within their hearts on the Lord's Name; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, they know the One Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  One who is attached to the branch, does not receive the fruits.<br>

  Some grow rich as householders, but she does not belong to them.<br>
  Some call themselves men of charity, and she torments them terribly.<br>
  The Lord has saved me, by attaching me to the Feet of the True Guru. ||2||<br>
  She leads astray the penitents who practice penance.<br>
  The scholarly Pandits are all seduced by greed.<br>
  The world of the three qualities is enticed, and the heavens are enticed.<br>
  The True Guru has saved me, by giving me His Hand. ||3||<br>
  She is the slave of those who are spiritually wise.<br>
  With her palms pressed together, she serves them and offers her prayer:<br>
  "Whatever you wish, that is what I shall do."<br>
  O servant Nanak, she does not draw near to the Gurmukh. ||4||1||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  I have been separated from my Beloved by Maya (my mother-in-law).<br>
  Hope and desire (my younger brother-in-law and sister-in-law) are dying of grief.<br>
  I am no longer swayed by the fear of Death (my elder brother-in-law).<br>
  I am protected by my All-knowing, Wise Husband Lord. ||1||<br>
  Listen, O people: I have tasted the elixir of love.<br>
  The evil ones are dead, and my enemies are destroyed. The True Guru has given me the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  First, I renounced my egotistical love of myself.<br>
  Second, I renounced the ways of the world.<br>
  Renouncing the three qualities, I look alike upon friend and enemy.<br>
  And then, the fourth state of bliss was revealed to me by the Holy One. ||2||<br>
  In the cave of celestial bliss, I have obtained a seat.<br>
  The Lord of Light plays the unstruck melody of bliss.<br>
  I am in ecstasy, contemplating the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<br>
  Imbued with my Beloved Husband Lord, I am the blessed, happy soul-bride. ||3||<br>
  Servant Nanak chants the wisdom of God;<br>
  one who listens and practices it, is carried across and saved.<br>
  He is not born, and he does not die; he does not come or go.<br>
  He remains blended with the Lord. ||4||2||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  The bride shows such special devotion, and has such an agreeable disposition.<br>
  Her beauty is incomparable, and her character is perfect.<br>
  The house in which she dwells is such a praiseworthy house.<br>
  But rare are those who, as Gurmukh, attain that state||1||<br>
  As the soul-bride of pure actions, I have met with the Guru.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 025</h2></center>
  In worship, marriage and in the next world, such a soul-bride looks beautiful. ||1||Pause||<br>
  As long as she lived with her father,<br>
  her Husband wandered around in sadness.<br>
  I served and surrendered to the Lord, the True Being;<br>
  the Guru brought my bride to my home, and I obtained total happiness. ||2||<br>
  She is blessed with all sublime attributes, and her generations are unblemished.<br>
  Her Husband, her Lord and Master, fulfills her heart's desires.<br>
  Hope and desire (my younger brother-in-law and sister-in-law) are now totally content. ||3||<br>
  She is the most noble of all the family.<br>
  She counsels and advises her hope and desire.<br>
  How blessed is that household, in which she has appeared.<br>
  O servant Nanak, she passes her time in perfect peace and comfort. ||4||3||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Whatever I resolve, she does not allow it to come to pass.<br>
  She stands blocking the way of goodness and self-discipline.<br>
  She wears many disguises, and assumes many forms,<br>
  and she does not allow me to dwell in my own home. She forces me to wander around in different directions. ||1||<br>
  She has become the mistress of my home, and she does not allow me to live in it.<br>
  If I try, she fights with me. ||1||Pause||<br>
  In the beginning, she was sent as a helper,<br>
  but she has overwhelmed the nine continents, all places and interspaces.<br>
  She has not spared even the river banks, the sacred shrines of pilgrimage, the Yogis and Sannyaasees,<br>
  or those who tirelessly read the Simritees and study the Vedas. ||2||<br>
  Wherever I sit, she sits there with me.<br>
  She has imposed her power upon the whole world.<br>
  Seeking meager protection, I am not protected from her.<br>
  Tell me, O my friend: unto whom should I turn for protection? ||3||<br>
  I heard of His Teachings, and so I have come to the True Guru.<br>
  The Guru has implanted the Mantra of the Lord's Name, Har, Har, within me.<br>
  And now, I dwell in the home of my own inner self; I sing the Glorious Praises of the Infinite Lord.<br>
  I have met God, O Nanak, and I have become care-free. ||4||<br>
  My home is now my own, and she is now my mistress.<br>
  She is now my servant, and the Guru has made me intimate with the Lord. ||1||Second Pause||4||4||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  First, they advised me to send a letter.<br>
  Second, they advised me to send two men.<br>
  Third, they advised me to make the effort and do something.<br>
  But I have renounced everything, and I meditate only on You, God. ||1||<br>
  Now, I am totally blissful, carefree and at ease.<br>
  The enemies and evil-doers have perished, and I have obtained peace. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The True Guru has imparted the Teachings to me.<br>
  My soul, body and everything belong to the Lord.<br>
  Whatever I do, is by Your Almighty Power.<br>
  You are my only Support, You are my only Court. ||2||<br>
  If I were to renounce You, God, unto whom could I turn?<br>
  There is no other, comparable to You.<br>
  Who else is Your servant to serve?<br>
  The faithless cynics are deluded; they wander around in the wilderness. ||3||<br>
  Your Glorious Greatness cannot be described.<br>
  Wherever I am, you save me, hugging me close in Your embrace.<br>
  Nanak, Your slave, has entered Your Sanctuary.<br>
  God has preserved his honor, and congratulations are pouring in. ||4||5||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 026</h2></center>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Having wandered through foreign lands, I have come here to do business.<br>
  I heard of the incomparable and profitable merchandise.<br>
  I have gathered in my pockets my capital of virtue, and I have brought it here with me.<br>
  Beholding the jewel, this mind is fascinated. ||1||<br>
  I have come to the door of the Trader.<br>
  Please display the merchandise, so that the business may be transacted. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The Trader has sent me to the Banker.<br>
  The jewel is priceless, and the capital is priceless.<br>
  O my gentle brother, mediator and friend<br>
  - I have obtained the merchandise, and my consciousness is now steady and stable. ||2||<br>
  I have no fear of thieves, of wind or water.<br>
  I have easily made my purchase, and I easily take it away.<br>
  I have earned Truth, and I shall have no pain.<br>
  I have brought this merchandise home, safe and sound. ||3||<br>
  I have earned the profit, and I am happy.<br>
  Blessed is the Banker, the Perfect Bestower.<br>
  How rare is the Gurmukh who obtains this merchandise;<br>
  Nanak has brought this profitable merchandise home. ||4||6||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  He does not consider my merits or demerits.<br>
  He does not look at my beauty, color or decorations.<br>
  I do not know the ways of wisdom and good conduct.<br>
  But taking me by the arm, my Husband Lord has led me to His Bed. ||1||<br>
  Hear, O my companions, my Husband, my Lord Master, possesses me.<br>
  Placing His Hand upon my forehead, He protects me as His Own. What do these ignorant people know? ||1||Pause||<br>
  My married life now appears so beauteous;<br>
  my Husband Lord has met me, and He sees all my pains.<br>
  Within the courtyard of my heart, the glory of the moon shines.<br>
  Night and day, I have fun with my Beloved. ||2||<br>
  My clothes are dyed the deep crimson color of the poppy.<br>
  All the ornaments and garlands around my neck adorn me.<br>
  Gazing upon my Beloved with my eyes, I have obtained all treasures;<br>
  I have shaken off the power of the evil demons. ||3||<br>
  I have obtained eternal bliss, and I constantly celebrate.<br>
  With the nine treasures of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, I am satisfied in my own home.<br>
  Says Nanak, when the happy soul-bride is adorned by her Beloved,<br>
  she is forever happy with her Husband Lord. ||4||7||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  They give you donations and worship you.<br>
  You take from them, and then deny that they have given anything to you.<br>
  That door, through which you must ultimately go, O Brahmin<br>
  - at that door, you will come to regret and repent. ||1||<br>
  Such Brahmins shall drown, O Siblings of Destiny;<br>
  they think of doing evil to the innocent. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Within them is greed, and they wander around like mad dogs.<br>
  They slander others and carry loads of sin upon their heads.<br>
  Intoxicated by Maya, they do not think of the Lord.<br>
  Deluded by doubt, they wander off on many paths. ||2||<br>
  Outwardly, they wear various religious robes,<br>
  but within, they are enveloped by poison.<br>
  They instruct others, but do not understand themselves.<br>
  Such Brahmins will never be emancipated. ||3||<br>
  O foolish Brahmin, reflect upon God.<br>
  He watches and hears, and is always with you.<br>
  Says Nanak, if this is your destiny,<br>
  renounce your pride, and grasp the Guru's Feet. ||4||8||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 027</h2></center>
  Pain and disease have left my body, and my mind has become pure; I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, Har, Har.<br>
  I am in bliss, meeting with the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and now, my mind does not go wandering. ||1||<br>
  My burning desires are quenched, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, O mother.<br>
  The fever of doubt has been totally eliminated; meeting the Guru, I am cooled and soothed, with intuitive ease. ||1||Pause||<br>
  My wandering has ended, since I have realized the One and Only Lord; now, I have come to dwell in the eternal place.<br>
  Your Saints are the Saving Grace of the world; beholding the Blessed Vision of their Darshan, I remain satisfied. ||2||<br>
  I have left behind the sins of countless incarnations, now that I have grasped the feet of the eternal Holy Guru.<br>
  My mind sings the celestial melody of bliss,<br>
  and death shall no longer consume it. ||3||<br>
  My Lord, the Cause of all causes, is All-powerful, the Giver of peace; He is my Lord, my Lord King.<br>
  Nanak lives by chanting Your Name, O Lord; You are my helper, with me, through and through. ||4||9||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  The slanderer cries out and bewails.<br>
  He has forgotten the Supreme Lord, the Transcendent Lord; the slanderer reaps the rewards of his own actions. ||1||Pause||<br>
  If someone is his companion, then he shall be taken along with him.<br>
  Like the dragon, the slanderer carries his huge, useless loads, and burns in his own fire. ||1||<br>
  Nanak proclaims and announces what happens at the Door of the Transcendent Lord.<br>
  The humble devotees of the Lord are forever in bliss; singing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises, they blossom forth. ||2||10||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Even though I totally decorated myself,<br>
  still, my mind was not satisfied.<br>
  I applied various scented oils to my body,<br>
  and yet, I did not obtain even a tiny bit of pleasure from this.<br>
  Within my mind, I hold such a desire,<br>
  that I may live only to behold my Beloved, O my mother. ||1||<br>
  O mother, what should I do? This mind cannot rest.<br>
  It is bewitched by the tender love of my Beloved. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Garments, ornaments, and such exquisite pleasures<br>
  - I look upon these as of no account.<br>
  Likewise, honor, fame, dignity and greatness,<br>
  obedience by the whole world,<br>
  and a household as beautiful as a jewel.<br>
  If I am pleasing to God's Will, then I shall be blessed, and forever in bliss. ||2||<br>
  With foods and delicacies of so many different kinds,<br>
  and such abundant pleasures and entertainments,<br>
  power and property and absolute command<br>
  - with these, the mind is not satisfied, and its thirst is not quenched.<br>
  Without meeting Him, this day does not pass.<br>
  Meeting God, I find peace. ||3||<br>
  By searching and seeking, I have heard this news,<br>
  that without the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, no one swims across.<br>
  One who has this good destiny written upon his forehead, finds the True Guru.<br>
  His hopes are fulfilled, and his mind is satisfied.<br>
  When one meets God, then his thirst is quenched.<br>
  Nanak has found the Lord, within his mind and body. ||4||11||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl, Panch-Padas:<br>

  First, your social status is high.<br>
  Second, you are honored in society.<br>
  Third, your home is beautiful.<br>
  But you are so ugly, with self-conceit in your mind. ||1||<br>
  O beautiful, attractive, wise and clever woman:<br>
  you have been trapped by your pride and attachment. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Your kitchen is so clean.<br>
  You take your bath, and worship, and apply the crimson mark upon your forehead;<br>
  with your mouth you speak wisdom, but you are destroyed by pride.<br>
  The dog of greed has ruined you in every way. ||2||<br>
  You wear your robes and enjoy pleasures;<br>
  you practice good conduct to impress people;<br>
  you apply scented oils of sandalwood and musk,<br>
  but your constant companion is the demon of anger. ||3||<br>
  Other people may be your water-carriers;<br>
  in this world, you may be a ruler.<br>
  Gold, silver and wealth may be yours,<br>
  but the goodness of your conduct has been destroyed by sexual promiscuity. ||4||<br>
  That soul, upon whom the Lord has bestowed His Glance of Grace,<br>
  is delivered from bondage.<br>
  Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the Lord's sublime essence is obtained.<br>
  Says Nanak, how fruitful is that body. ||5||<br>
  All graces and all comforts shall come to you, as the happy soul-bride;<br>
  you shall be supremely beautiful and wise. ||1||Second Pause||12||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl, Ik-Tukas 2 :<br>
  One who is seen to be alive, shall surely die.<br>
  But he who is dead shall remain ever-lasting. ||1||<br>
  Those who die while yet alive, shall through this death, live on.<br>
  They place the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, as medicine in their mouths, and through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, they drink in the Ambrosial Nectar. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The clay pot of the body shall be broken.<br>
  One who has eliminated the three qualities dwells in the home of his inner self. ||2||<br>
  One who climbs high, shall fall into the nether regions of the underworld.<br>
  One who lies upon the ground, shall not be touched by death. ||3||<br>
  Those who continue to wander around, achieve nothing.<br>
  Those who practice the Guru's Teachings, become steady and stable. ||4||<br>
  This body and soul all belong to the Lord.<br>
  O Nanak, meeting the Guru, I am enraptured. ||5||13||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  The puppet of the body has been fashioned with great skill.<br>
  Know for sure that it shall turn to dust. ||1||<br>
  Remember your origins, O thoughtless fool.<br>
  Why are you so proud of yourself? ||1||Pause||<br>
  You are a guest, given three meals a day;<br>
  other things are entrusted to you. ||2||<br>
  you are just excrement, bones and blood, wrapped up in skin<br>
  - this is what you are taking such pride in! ||3||<br>
  If you could understand even one thing, then you would be pure.<br>
  Without understanding, you shall be forever impure. ||4||<br>
  Says Nanak, I am a sacrifice to the Guru;<br>
  through Him, I obtain the Lord, the All-knowing Primal Being. ||5||14||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl, Ik-Tukas, Chau-Padas:<br>
  One moment, one day, is for me many days.<br>
  My mind cannot survive - how can I meet my Beloved? ||1||<br>
  I cannot endure one day, even one instant without Him.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 029</h2></center>
  My mind's desire for the Blessed Vision of His Darshan is so great. Is there any Saint who can lead me to meet my Beloved? ||1||Pause||<br>
  The four watches of the day are like the four ages.<br>
  And when night comes, I think that it shall never end. ||2||<br>
  The five demons have joined together, to separate me from my Husband Lord.<br>
  Wandering and rambling, I cry out and wring my hands. ||3||<br>
  The Lord has revealed the Blessed Vision of His Darshan to servant Nanak;<br>
  realizing his own self, he has obtained supreme peace. ||4||15||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  In the Lord's service, are the greatest treasures.<br>
  Serving the Lord, the Ambrosial Naam comes into one's mouth. ||1||<br>
  The Lord is my Companion; He is with me, as my Help and Support.<br>
  In pain and pleasure, whenever I remember Him, He is present. How can the poor Messenger of Death frighten me now? ||1||Pause||<br>
  The Lord is my Support; the Lord is my Power.<br>
  The Lord is my Friend; He is my mind's advisor. ||2||<br>
  The Lord is my capital; the Lord is my credit.<br>
  As Gurmukh, I earn the wealth, with the Lord as my Banker. ||3||<br>
  By Guru's Grace, this wisdom has come.<br>
  Servant Nanak has merged into the Being of the Lord. ||4||16||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  When God shows His Mercy, then this mind is focused on Him.<br>
  Serving the True Guru, all rewards are obtained. ||1||<br>
  O my mind, why are you so sad? My True Guru is Perfect.<br>
  He is the Giver of blessings, the treasure of all comforts; His Ambrosial Pool of Nectar is always overflowing. ||1||Pause||<br>
  One who enshrines His Lotus Feet within the heart,<br>
  meets the Beloved Lord; the Divine Light is revealed to him. ||2||<br>
  The five companions have met together to sing the songs of joy.<br>
  The unstruck melody, the sound current of the Naad, vibrates and resounds. ||3||<br>
  O Nanak, when the Guru is totally pleased, one meets the Lord, the King.<br>
  Then, the night of one's life passes in peace and natural ease. ||4||17||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Showing His Mercy, the Lord has revealed Himself to me.<br>
  Meeting the True Guru, I have received the perfect wealth. ||1||<br>
  Gather such a wealth of the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny.<br>
  It cannot be burned by fire, and water cannot drown it; it does not forsake society, or go anywhere else. ||1||Pause||<br>
  It does not run short, and it does not run out.<br>
  Eating and consuming it, the mind remains satisfied. ||2||<br>
  He is the true banker, who gathers the wealth of the Lord within his own home.<br>
  With this wealth, the whole world profits. ||3||<br>
  He alone receives the Lord's wealth, who is pre-ordained to receive it.<br>
  O servant Nanak, at that very last moment, the Naam shall be your only decoration. ||4||18||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Just like the farmer, He plants His crop,<br>
  and, whether it is ripe or unripe, He cuts it down. ||1||<br>
  Just so, you must know this well, that whoever is born, shall die.<br>
  Only the devotee of the Lord of the Universe becomes stable and permanent. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The day shall certainly be followed by the night.<br>
  And when the night passes, the morning shall again dawn. ||2||<br>
  In the love of Maya, the unfortunate ones remain in sleep.<br>

  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  The nine treasures are Yours - all treasures are Yours.<br>
  The Fulfiller of desires saves mortals in the end. ||1||<br>
  You are my Beloved, so what hunger can I have?<br>
  When You dwell within my mind, pain does not touch me. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Whatever You do, is acceptable to me.<br>
  O True Lord and Master, True is Your Order. ||2||<br>
  When it is pleasing to Your Will, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.<br>
  Within Your Home, there is justice, forever and ever. ||3||<br>
  O True Lord and Master, You are unknowable and mysterious.<br>
  Nanak is committed to Your service. ||4||20||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  He is near at hand; He is the eternal Companion of the soul.<br>
  His Creative Power is all-pervading, in form and color. ||1||<br>
  My mind does not worry; it does not grieve, or cry out.<br>
  Imperishable, Unshakable, Unapproachable and forever safe and sound is my Husband Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Unto whom does Your servant pay homage?<br>
  His King preserves his honor. ||2||<br>
  That slave, whom God has released from the restrictions of social status<br>
  - who can now hold him in bondage? ||3||<br>
  The Lord is absolutely independent, and totally care-free;<br>
  O servant Nanak, chant His Glorious Praises. ||4||21||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Forsaking the Lord's sublime essence, the mortal is intoxicated with false essences.<br>
  The substance is within the home of the self, but the mortal goes out to find it. ||1||<br>
  He cannot hear the true ambrosial discourse.<br>
  Attached to false scriptures, he is engaged in argument. ||1||Pause||<br>
  He takes his wages from his Lord and Master, but he serves another.<br>
  With such sins, the mortal is engrossed. ||2||<br>
  He tries to hide from the One who is always with him.<br>
  He begs from Him, again and again. ||3||<br>

  As it pleases Him, He cherishes us. ||4||22||<br>

  My mind is attached to the Lord's Lotus Feet.<br>

  Unto Nanak, the Guru has revealed these instructions:<br>
  recognize the Imperishable Lord God in each and every heart. ||4||23||<br>

  O sublime understanding, come, enter into my mind,<br>
  that I may meditate and sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe, and love so dearly the Lord's Name. ||1||Pause||<br>
  I am satisfied and satiated by the True Name.<br>
  My cleansing bath at the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage is the dust of the Saints. ||2||<br>
  I recognize that the One Creator is contained in all.<br>
  Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, my understanding is refined. ||3||<br>
  I have become the servant of all; I have renounced my ego and pride.<br>
  The Guru has given this gift to Nanak. ||4||25||<br>

  Such are the Teachings which I have received from the Guru;<br>
  while I was drowning in the pitch black well, I was saved, O my Siblings of Destiny. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The Guru is the boat to cross over the totally unfathomable ocean of fire; He is treasure of jewels. ||2||<br>
  This ocean of Maya is dark and treacherous.<br>
  The Perfect Guru has revealed the way to cross over it. ||3||<br>
  I do not have the ability to chant or practice intense meditation.<br>
  Guru Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary. ||4||26||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl, Ti-Padas:<br>
  One who drinks in the Lord's sublime essence is forever imbued with it,<br>
  while other essences wear off in an instant.<br>
  Intoxicated with the Lord's sublime essence, the mind is forever in ecstasy.<br>
  Other essences bring only anxiety. ||1||<br>
  One who drinks in the Lord's sublime essence, is intoxicated and enraptured;<br>
  all other essences have no effect. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The value of the Lord's sublime essence cannot be described.<br>
  The Lord's sublime essence permeates the homes of the Holy.<br>
  One may spend thousands and millions, but it cannot be purchased.<br>
  He alone obtains it, who is so pre-ordained. ||2||<br>
  Tasting it, Nanak is wonder-struck.<br>
  Through the Guru, Nanak has obtained this taste.<br>
  Here and hereafter, it does not leave him.<br>
  Nanak is imbued and enraptured with the Lord's subtle essence. ||3||27||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  If she renounces and eliminates her sexual desire, anger, greed and attachment, and her evil-mindedness and self-conceit as well;<br>
  and if, becoming humble, she serves Him, then she becomes dear to her Beloved's Heart. ||1||<br>
  Listen, O beautiful soul-bride: By the Word of the Holy Saint, you shall be saved.<br>
  Your pain, hunger and doubt shall vanish, and you shall obtain peace, O happy soul-bride. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Washing the Guru's feet, and serving Him, the soul is sanctified, and the thirst for sin is quenched.<br>
  If you become the slave of the slave of the Lord's slaves, then you shall obtain honor in the Court of the Lord. ||2||<br>
  This is right conduct, and this is the correct lifestyle, to obey the Command of the Lord's Will; this is your devotional worship.<br>

  This is your chance to meet the Lord of the Universe.<br>
  Other efforts are of no use to you.<br>
  Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, vibrate and meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||<br>
  Make the effort, and cross over the terrifying world ocean.<br>
  This human life is passing away in vain, in the love of Maya. ||1||Pause||<br>
  I have not practiced meditation, penance, self-restraint or righteous living;<br>
  I have not served the Holy Saints, and I do not know the Lord, my King.<br>

  O Lord, I seek Your Sanctuary - please, preserve my honor. ||2||29||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Without You, there is no other for me; You alone are in my mind.<br>
  You are my Friend and Companion, God; why should my soul be afraid? ||1||<br>
  You are my support, You are my hope.<br>
  While sitting down or standing up, while sleeping or waking, with every breath and morsel of food, I never forget You. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Protect me, please protect me, O God; I have come to Your Sanctuary; the ocean of fire is so horrible.<br>

  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  The Lord God has saved me, His slave.<br>
  My mind has surrendered to my Beloved; my fever has taken poison and died. ||1||Pause||<br>

  I am in ecstasy, and all of my sorrows have been dispelled. ||1||Pause||<br>
  All beings and creatures obtain peace,<br>
  O Nanak, meditating on the Supreme Lord God. ||2||32||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  That time, which the mortal does not wish for, eventually comes.<br>
  Without the Lord's Command, how can understanding be understood? ||1||<br>
  The body is consumed by water, fire and earth.<br>
  But the soul is neither young nor old, O Siblings of Destiny. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Servant Nanak has entered the Sanctuary of the Holy.<br>

  Showing His Mercy, He joins her with His Feet,<br>
  and she attains celestial peace, joy and comfort. ||1||<br>
  In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, she sings the Glorious Praises of the Immeasurable Lord.<br>
  Remembering the Lord in meditation, O Nanak, she becomes invaluable. ||2||35||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Sexual desire, anger, intoxication with Maya and jealousy - I have lost all of these in the game of chance.<br>
  Purity, contentment, compassion, faith and truthfulness - I have ushered these into the home of my self. ||1||<br>
  All the loads of birth and death have been removed.<br>
  Joining the Saints' Society, my mind has become pure; the Perfect Guru has saved me in an instant. ||1||Pause||<br>
  My mind has become the dust of all, and everyone seems a sweet friend to me.<br>
  My Lord and Master is contained in all. He gives His Gifts to all beings, and cherishes them. ||2||<br>
  He Himself is the One and only; from the One, the One and only, came the expanse of the entire creation.<br>
  Chanting and meditating, all the humble beings have become Holy; meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, so many have been saved. ||3||<br>
  The Lord of the Universe is deep, profound and infinite; He has no end or limitation.<br>
  By Your Grace, Nanak sings Your Glorious Praises; meditating, meditating, he humbly bows to God. ||4||36||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  You are Infinite, Eternal and Incomprehensible; all this is Your Creation.<br>
  What clever games can we play, when everything is contained in You? ||1||<br>
  O my True Guru, protect me, Your child, through the power of Your play.<br>
  Grant me the good sense to ever sing Your Glorious Praises, O my Inaccessible and Infinite Lord and Master. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The mortal is preserved in the womb of his mother, by the Support of the Naam, the Name of the Lord;<br>
  he makes merry, and with each and every breath he remembers the Lord, and the fire does not touch him. ||2||<br>
  Others' wealth, others' wives, and the slander of others - renounce your craving for these.<br>
  Serve the Lord's Lotus Feet within your heart, and hold to the Support of the Perfect Guru. ||3||<br>
  Houses, mansions and palaces which you see - none of these shall go with you.<br>
  As long as you live in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, O servant Nanak, remember the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||4||37||<br>

  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Power, property, youth, household, fame and the beauty of youth;<br>
  great wealth, elephants, horses and jewels, purchased with tens of thousands of dollars;<br>
  hereafter, these shall be of no avail in the Court of the Lord; the proud must depart, leaving them behind. ||1||<br>
  Why center your consciousness on any other than the Lord?<br>
  Sitting down, standing up, sleeping and waking, forever and ever, meditate on the Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  He may have the most wondrous and beautiful arenas, and be victorious on the field of battle.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 034</h2></center>
  He may proclaim, "I can kill anyone, I can capture anyone, and I can release anyone."<br>
  But when the Order comes from the Supreme Lord God, he departs and leaves in a day. ||2||<br>
  He may perform all sorts of religious rituals and good actions, but he does not know the Creator Lord, the Doer of all.<br>
  He teaches, but does not practice what he preaches; he does not realize the essential reality of the Word of the Shabad.<br>
  Naked he came, and naked he shall depart; he is like an elephant, throwing dust on himself. ||3||<br>
  O Saints, and friends, listen to me: all this world is false.<br>
  Continually claiming, "Mine, mine", the mortals are drowned; the fools waste away and die.<br>
  Meeting the Guru, O Nanak, I meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord; through the True Name, I am emancipated. ||4||1||38||<br>
  Raag Aasaa, Fifth House, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  The whole world is asleep in doubt; it is blinded by worldly entanglements.<br>
  How rare is that humble servant of the Lord who is awake and aware. ||1||<br>
  The mortal is intoxicated with the great enticement of Maya, which is dearer to him than life.<br>
  How rare is the one who renounces it. ||2||<br>
  The Lord's Lotus Feet are incomparably beautiful; so is the Mantra of the Saint.<br>
  How rare is that holy person who is attached to them. ||3||<br>
  O Nanak, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the love of divine knowledge is awakened;<br>
  the Lord's Mercy is bestowed upon those who are blessed with such good destiny. ||4||1||39||<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Raag Aasaa, Sixth House, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Whatever pleases You is acceptable to me; that alone brings peace and ease to my mind.<br>
  You are the Doer, the Cause of causes, All-powerful and Infinite; there is none other than You. ||1||<br>
  Your humble servants sing Your Glorious Praises with enthusiasm and love.<br>
  That alone is good advice, wisdom and cleverness for Your humble servant, which You do or cause to be done. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Your Name is Ambrosial Nectar, O Beloved Lord; in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I have obtained its sublime essence.<br>
  Those humble beings are satisfied and fulfilled, singing the Praises of the Lord, the treasure of peace. ||2||<br>
  One who has Your Support, O Lord Master, is not afflicted by anxiety.<br>
  One who is blessed by Your Kind Mercy, is the best, the most fortunate king. ||3||<br>
  Doubt, attachment, and deceit have all disappeared, since I obtained the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan.<br>
  Dealing in the Naam, O Nanak, we become truthful, and in the Love of the Lord's Name, we are absorbed. ||4||1 | 40||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  He washes off the filth of other peoples' incarnations, but he obtains the rewards of his own actions.<br>
  He has no peace in this world, and he has no place in the Court of the Lord. In the City of Death, he is tortured. ||1||<br>
  The slanderer loses his life in vain.<br>
  He cannot succeed in anything, and in the world hereafter, he finds no place at all. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Such is the fate of the wretched slanderer - what can the poor creature do?<br>
  He is ruined there, where no one can protect him; with whom should he lodge his complaint? ||2||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 035</h2></center>
  The slanderer shall never attain emancipation; this is the Will of the Lord and Master.<br>
  The more the Saints are slandered, the more they dwell in peace. ||3||<br>
  The Saints have Your Support, O Lord and Master; You are the Saints' Help and Support.<br>
  Says Nanak, the Saints are saved by the Lord; the slanderers are drowned in the deep. ||4||2||41||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  He washes outwardly, but within, his mind is filthy; thus he loses his place in both worlds.<br>
  Here, he is engrossed in sexual desire, anger and emotional attachment; hereafter, he shall sigh and weep. ||1||<br>
  The way to vibrate and meditate on the Lord of the Universe is different.<br>
  Destroying the snake-hole, the snake is not killed; the deaf person does not hear the Lord's Name. ||1||Pause||<br>
  He renounces the affairs of Maya, but he does not appreciate the value of devotional worship.<br>
  He finds fault with the Vedas and the Shaastras, and does not know the essence of Yoga. ||2||<br>
  He stands exposed, like a counterfeit coin, when inspected by the Lord, the Assayer.<br>
  The Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, knows everything; how can we hide anything from Him? ||3||<br>
  Through falsehood, fraud and deceit, the mortal collapses in an instant - he has no foundation at all.<br>
  Truly, truly, truly, Nanak speaks; look within your own heart, and realize this. ||4||3||42||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Making the effort, the mind becomes pure; in this dance, the self is silenced.<br>
  The five passions are kept under control, and the One Lord dwells in the mind. ||1||<br>
  Your humble servant dances and sings Your Glorious Praises.<br>
  He plays upon the guitar, tambourine and cymbals, and the unstruck sound current of the Shabad resounds. ||1||Pause||<br>
  First, he instructs his own mind, and then, he leads others.<br>
  He chants the Lord's Name and meditates on it in his heart; with his mouth, he announces it to all. ||2||<br>
  He joins the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and washes their feet; he applies the dust of the Saints to his body<br>
  He surrenders his mind and body, and places them before the Guru; thus, he obtains the true wealth. ||3||<br>
  Whoever listens to, and beholds the Guru with faith, shall see his pains of birth and death taken away.<br>
  Such a dance eliminates hell; O Nanak, the Gurmukh remains wakeful. ||4||4||43||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  The lowly outcaste becomes a Brahmin, and the untouchable sweeper becomes pure and sublime.<br>
  The burning desire of the nether regions and the etheric realms is finally quenched and extinguished. ||1||<br>
  The house-cat has been taught otherwise, and is terrified upon seeing the mouse.<br>
  The Guru has put the tiger under the control of the sheep, and now, the dog eats grass. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Without pillars, the roof is supported, and the homeless have found a home.<br>
  Without the jeweller, the jewel has been set, and the wonderful stone shines forth. ||2||<br>
  The claimant does not succeed by placing his claim, but by keeping silent, he obtains justice.<br>
  The dead sit on costly carpets, and what is seen with the eyes shall vanish. ||3||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 036</h2></center>
  One who claims to know, is ignorant; he does not know the Knower of all.<br>
  Says Nanak, the Guru has given me the Ambrosial Nectar to drink in; savoring it and relishing it, I blossom forth in bliss. ||4||5||44||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  He has cut away my bonds, and overlooked my shortcomings, and so He has confirmed His nature.<br>
  Becoming merciful to me, like a mother or a father, he has come to cherish me as His own child. ||1||<br>
  The GurSikhs are preserved by the Guru, by the Lord of the Universe.<br>
  He rescues them from the terrible world ocean, casting His Glance of Grace upon them. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Meditating in remembrance on Him, we escape from the Messenger of Death; here and hereafter, we obtain peace.<br>
  With every breath and morsel of food, meditate, and chant with your tongue, continually, each and every day; sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||2||<br>
  Through loving devotional worship, the supreme status is obtained, and in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, sorrows are dispelled.<br>
  I am not worn down, I do not die, and nothing strikes fear in me, since I have the wealth of the Lord's Immaculate Name in my purse. ||3||<br>
  At the very last moment, God becomes the mortal's Help and Support; here and hereafter, He is the Savior Lord.<br>
  He is my breath of life, my friend, support and wealth; O Nanak, I am forever a sacrifice to Him. ||4||6||45||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Since You are my Lord and Master, what is there for me to fear? Other than You, who else should I praise?<br>
  You are the One and only, and so do all things exist; without You, there is nothing at all for me. ||1||<br>
  O Father, I have seen that the world is poison.<br>
  Save me, O Lord of the Universe! Your Name is my only Support. ||1||Pause||<br>
  You know completely the condition of my mind; who else could I go to tell of it?<br>
  Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the whole world has gone crazy; obtaining the Naam, it finds peace. ||2||<br>
  What shall I say? Unto whom shall I speak? What I have to say, I say to God.<br>
  Everything which exists was created by You. You are my hope, forever and ever. ||3||<br>
  If you bestow greatness, then it is Your greatness; here and hereafter, I meditate on You.<br>
  The Lord God of Nanak is forever the Giver of peace; Your Name is my only strength. ||4||7||46||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Your Name is Ambrosial Nectar, O Lord Master; Your humble servant drinks in this supreme elixir.<br>
  The fearful load of sins from countless incarnations has vanished; doubt and duality are also dispelled. ||1||<br>
  I live by beholding the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan.<br>
  Listening to Your Words, O True Guru, my mind and body are cooled and soothed. ||1||Pause||<br>
  By Your Grace, I have joined the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; You Yourself have caused this to happen.<br>
  Holding fast to Your Feet, O God, the poison is easily neutralized. ||2||<br>
  Your Name, O God, is the treasure of peace; I have received this everlasting Mantra.<br>
  Showing His Mercy, the True Guru has given it to me, and my fever and pain and hatred are annulled. ||3||<br>
  Blessed is the attainment of this human body, by which God blends Himself with me.<br>
  Blessed, in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, is the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, where the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises are sung.O Nanak, the Naam is my only Support. ||4||8||47||<br>

  Everything is pre-ordained; what else can be known through study?<br>
  The errant child has been forgiven by the Supreme Lord God. ||1||<br>
  My True Guru is always merciful; He has saved me, the meek one.<br>
  He has cured me of my disease, and I have obtained the greatest peace; He has placed the Ambrosial Name of the Lord in my mouth. ||1||Pause||<br>
  He has washed away my countless sins; He has cut away my bonds, and I am liberated.<br>
  He has taken me by the arm, and pulled me out of the terrible, deep dark pit. ||2||<br>
  I have become fearless, and all my fears have been erased. The Savior Lord has saved me.<br>
  Such is Your generosity, O my God, that You have resolved all my affairs. ||3||<br>

  I do not know any other at all, O True, Invisible, Inscrutable Lord. ||1||<br>
  When You come to mind, You are always merciful to me; what can the poor people do to me?<br>
  Tell me, who should I call good or bad, since all beings are Yours? ||1||Pause||<br>
  You are my Shelter, You are my Support; giving me Your hand, You protect me.<br>
  That humble being, upon whom You bestow Your Grace, is not touched by slander or suffering. ||2||<br>
  That is peace, and that is greatness, which is pleasing to the mind of the Dear Lord God.<br>
  You are all-knowing, You are forever compassionate; obtaining Your Name, I revel in it and make merry. ||3||<br>

  Meeting with my Beloved Lord aand Master, all my pains are taken away.<br>
  I am saved and carried across, in the company of those who remember the Supreme Lord God in their hearts. ||1||Pause||<br>
  This world is a great wilderness, an ocean of fire, in which mortals abide, in pleasure and pain.<br>
  Meeting with the True Guru, the mortal becomes immaculately pure; with his tongue, he chants the Ambrosial Name of the Lord. ||2||<br>
  He preserves his body and wealth, and takes everything as his own; such are the subtle bonds which bind him.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, the mortal becomes liberated, meditating on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||3||<br>
  God, the Savior, has saved those, who are pleasing to the Will of God.<br>

  The forest fire has burnt down so much of the grass; how rare are the plants which have remained green.<br>
  He is so All-powerful, that I cannot even describe Him; no one can chant His Praises. ||2||<br>
  In the store-room of the lamp-black, I did not turn black; my color remained immaculate and pure.<br>
  The Guru has implanted the Maha Mantra, the Great Mantra, within my heart, and I have heard the wondrous Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||3||<br>

  Wherever You send me, there I go.<br>
  Whatever You give me, brings me peace. ||1||<br>
  I am forever the chaylaa, the humble disciple, of the Lord of the Universe, the Sustainer of the World.<br>
  By Your Grace, I am satisfied and satiated. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Whatever You give me, I wear and eat.<br>
  By Your Grace, O God, my life passes peacefully. ||2||<br>
  Deep within my mind and body, I meditate on You.<br>
  I recognize none as equal to You. ||3||<br>
  Says Nanak, this is my continual meditation:<br>
  that I may be emancipated, clinging to the Feet of the Saints. ||4||9||60||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  While standing up, and sitting down, and even while asleep, meditate on the Lord.<br>
  Walking on the Way, sing the Praises of the Lord. ||1||<br>
  With your ears, listen to the Ambrosial Sermon.<br>
  Listening to it, your mind shall be filled with bliss, and the troubles and diseases of your mind shall all depart. ||1||Pause||<br>
  While you work at your job, on the road and at the beach, meditate and chant.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, drink in the Ambrosial Essence of the Lord. ||2||<br>
  The humble being who sings the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises, day and night,<br>
  does not have to go with the Messenger of Death. ||3||<br>
  One who does not forget the Lord, twenty-four hours a day, is emancipated;<br>
  O Nanak, I fall at his feet. ||4||10||61||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Remembering Him in meditation, one abides in peace;<br>
  one becomes happy, and suffering is ended. ||1||<br>
  Celebrate, make merry, and sing God's Glories.<br>
  Forever and ever, surrender to the True Guru. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Act in accordance with the Shabad, the True Word of the True Guru.<br>
  Remain steady and stable within the home of your own self, and find God. ||2||<br>
  Do not harbor evil intentions against others in your mind,<br>
  and you shall not be troubled, O Siblings of Destiny, O friends. ||3||<br>
  The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is the Tantric exercise, and the Mantra, given by the Guru.<br>
  Nanak knows this peace alone, night and day. ||4||11||62||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  That wretched being, whom no one knows<br>
  - chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, he is honored in the four directions. ||1||<br>
  I beg for the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan; please, give it to me, O Beloved!<br>
  Serving You, who, who has not been saved? ||1||Pause||<br>
  That person, whom no one wants to be near<br>
  - the whole world comes to wash the dirt of his feet. ||2||<br>
  That mortal, who is of no use to anyone at all<br>
  - by the Grace of the Saints, he meditates on the Naam. ||3||<br>
  In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the sleeping mind awakens.<br>
  Then, O Nanak, God seems sweet. ||4||12||63||<br>

  With my eyes, I behold the One and Only Lord.<br>
  Forever and ever, I contemplate the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 041</h2></center>
  I sing the Praises of the Lord, Raam, Raam, Raam.<br>
  By the graceful favor of the Saints, I meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Everything is strung on His string.<br>
  He is contained in each and every heart. ||2||<br>
  He creates and destroys in an instant.<br>
  He Himself remains unattached, and without attributes. ||3||<br>
  He is the Creator, the Cause of causes, the Searcher of hearts.<br>
  Nanak's Lord and Master celebrates in bliss. ||4||13||64||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  My wandering through millions of births has ended.<br>
  I have won, and not lost, this human body, so difficult to obtain. ||1||<br>
  My sins have been erased, and my sufferings and pains are gone.<br>
  I have been sanctified by the dust of the feet of the Saints. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The Saints of God have the ability to save us;<br>
  they meet with those of us who have such pre-ordained destiny. ||2||<br>
  My mind is filled with bliss, since the Guru gave me the Mantra of the Lord's Name.<br>
  My thirst has been quenched, and my mind has become steady and stable. ||3||<br>
  The wealth of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is for me the nine treasures, and the spiritual powers of the Siddhas.<br>
  O Nanak, I have obtained understanding from the Guru. ||4||14||65||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  My thirst, and the darkness of ignorance have been removed.<br>
  Serving the Holy Saints, countless sins are obliterated. ||1||<br>
  I have obtained celestial peace and immense joy.<br>
  Serving the Guru, my mind has become immaculately pure, and I have heard the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, Har, Har. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The stubborn foolishness of my mind is gone;<br>
  God's Will has become sweet to me. ||2||<br>
  I have grasped the Feet of the Perfect Guru,<br>
  and the sins of countless incarnations have been washed away. ||3||<br>
  The jewel of this life has become fruitful.<br>
  Says Nanak, God has shown mercy to me. ||4||15||66||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  I contemplate, forever and ever, the True Guru;<br>
  with my hair, I dust the feet of the Guru. ||1||<br>
  Be wakeful, O my awakening mind!<br>
  Without the Lord, nothing else shall be of use to you; false is emotional attachment, and useless are worldly entanglements. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Embrace love for the Word of the Guru's Bani.<br>
  When the Guru shows His Mercy, pain is destroyed. ||2||<br>
  Without the Guru, there is no other place of rest.<br>
  The Guru is the Giver, the Guru gives the Name. ||3||<br>
  The Guru is the Supreme Lord God; He Himself is the Transcendent Lord.<br>
  Twenty-four hours a day, O Nanak, meditate on the Guru. ||4||16||67||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  He Himself is the tree, and the branches extending out.<br>
  He Himself preserves His own crop. ||1||<br>
  Wherever I look, I see that One Lord alone.<br>
  Deep within each and every heart, He Himself is contained. ||1||Pause||<br>
  He Himself is the sun, and the rays emanating from it.<br>
  He is concealed, and He is revealed. ||2||<br>
  He is said to be of the highest attributes, and without attributes.<br>
  Both converge onto His single point. ||3||<br>
  Says Nanak, the Guru has dispelled my doubt and fear.<br>
  With my eyes, I perceive the Lord, the embodiment of bliss, to be everywhere. ||4||17||68||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  I know nothing of arguments or cleverness.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 042</h2></center>
  Day and night, I chant Your Name. ||1||<br>
  I am worthless; I have no virtue at all.<br>
  God is the Creator, the Cause of all causes. ||1||Pause||<br>
  I am foolish, stupid, ignorant and thoughtless;<br>
  Your Name is my mind's only hope. ||2||<br>
  I have not practiced chanting, deep meditation, self-discipline or good actions;<br>
  but within my mind, I have worshipped God's Name. ||3||<br>
  I know nothing, and my intellect is inadequate.<br>
  Prays Nanak, O God, You are my only Support. ||4||18||69||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  These two words, Har, Har, make up my maalaa.<br>
  Continually chanting and reciting this rosary, God has become merciful to me, His humble servant. ||1||<br>
  I offer my prayer to the True Guru.<br>
  Shower Your Mercy upon me, and keep me safe in Your Sanctuary; please, give me the maalaa, the rosary of Har, Har. ||1||Pause||<br>
  One who enshrines this rosary of the Lord's Name within his heart,<br>
  is freed of the pains of birth and death. ||2||<br>
  The humble being who contemplates the Lord within his heart, and chants the Lord's Name, Har, Har, with his mouth,<br>
  never wavers, here or hereafter. ||3||<br>

  goes to the next world with the maalaa of the Lord's Name. ||4||19||70||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  All things belong to Him - let yourself belong to Him as well.<br>
  No stain clings to such a humble being. ||1||<br>
  The Lord's servant is liberated forever.<br>
  Whatever He does, is pleasing to His servant; the way of life of His slave is immaculately pure. ||1||Pause||<br>
  One who renounces everything, and enters the Lord's Sanctuary<br>
  - how can Maya cling to him? ||2||<br>
  With the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, in his mind,<br>
  he suffers no anxiety, even in dreams. ||3||<br>
  Says Nanak, I have found the Perfect Guru.<br>
  My doubts and attachments have been totally obliterated. ||4||20||71||<br>

  then, tell me, how can suffering or doubt draw near me? ||1||<br>

  My suffering has been ended, and my anxiety is forgotten.<br>
  I have obtained my reward, chanting the Mantra of the True Guru. ||2||<br>
  He is True, and True is His glory.<br>
  Remembering, remembering Him in meditation, keep Him clasped to your heart. ||3||<br>
  Says Nanak, what action is there left to do,<br>
  by one whose mind is filled with the Lord's Name? ||4||21||72||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Sexual desire, anger, and egotism lead to ruin.<br>
  Meditating on the Lord, the Lord's humble servants are redeemed. ||1||<br>
  The mortals are asleep, intoxicated with the wine of Maya.<br>
  The devotees remain awake, imbued with the Lord's meditation. ||1||Pause||<br>
  In emotional attachment and doubt, the mortals wander through countless incarnations.<br>
  The devotees remain ever-stable, meditating on the Lord's Lotus Feet. ||2||<br>
  Bound to household and possessions, the mortals are lost in the deep, dark pit.<br>
  The Saints are liberated, knowing the Lord to be near at hand. ||3||<br>
  Says Nanak, one who has taken to God's Sanctuary,<br>
  obtains peace in this world, and salvation in the world hereafter. ||4||22||73||<br>

  You are my salvation and honor; You make me acceptable.<br>
  You are All-powerful, You are my strength. ||3||<br>
  Night and day, I chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the treasure of excellence.<br>
  This is Nanak's prayer to God. ||4||23||74||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  The mourner practices falsehood;<br>
  he laughs with glee, while mourning for others. ||1||<br>
  Someone has died, while there is singing in someone else's house.<br>
  One mourns and bewails, while another laughs with glee. ||1||Pause||<br>
  From childhood to old age,<br>
  the mortal does not attain his goals, and he comes to regret in the end. ||2||<br>
  The world is under the influence of the three qualities.<br>
  The mortal is reincarnated, again and again, into heaven and hell. ||3||<br>
  Says Nanak, one who is attached to the Naam, the Name of the Lord,<br>
  becomes acceptable, and his life becomes fruitful. ||4||24||75||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  She remains asleep, and does not know the news of God.<br>
  The day dawns, and then, she regrets. ||1||<br>
  Loving the Beloved, the mind is filled with celestial bliss.<br>
  You yearn to meet with God, so why do you delay? ||1||Pause||<br>
  He came and poured His Ambrosial Nectar into your hands,<br>
  but it slipped through your fingers, and fell onto the ground. ||2||<br>
  You are burdened with desire, emotional attachment and egotism;<br>
  it is not the fault of God the Creator. ||3||<br>

  O Nanak, the Creator Lord blends us with Himself. ||4||25||76||<br>

  The wretched Messenger of Death has run away from me. ||1||<br>
  You enter into my mind, by Your Kind Mercy.<br>
  Meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, all diseases are destroyed. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Death gives so much pain to others,<br>

  Night and day, the mouse of time gnaws away at the rope of life.<br>
  Falling into the well, the mortal eats the sweet treats of Maya. ||1||<br>
  Thinking and planning, the night of the life is passing away.<br>
  Thinking of the many pleasures of Maya, the mortal never remembers the Lord, the Sustainer of the earth. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Believing the shade of the tree to be permanent, he builds his house beneath it.<br>
  But the noose of death is around his neck, and Shakti, the power of Maya, has aimed her arrows at him. ||2||<br>
  The sandy shore is being washed away by the waves,<br>
  but the fool still believes that place to be permanent. ||3||<br>

  Becoming a king, the mortal wields his royal authority;<br>

 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 046</h2></center>
  Gathering it and collecting it, he fills his bags.<br>
  But God takes it away from him, and gives it to another. ||1||<br>
  The mortal is like an unbaked clay pot in water;<br>
  indulging in pride and egotism, he crumbles down and dissolves. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Being fearless, he becomes unrestrained.<br>
  He does not think of the Creator, who is ever with him.<br>
  He raises armies, and collects arms.<br>
  But when the breath leaves him, he turns to ashes. ||2||<br>
  He has lofty palaces, mansions and queens,<br>
  elephants and pairs of horses, delighting the mind;<br>
  he is blessed with a great family of sons and daughters.<br>
  But, engrossed in attachment, the blind fool wastes away to death. ||3||<br>

  I have renounced and discarded Maya, the Enticer of the world.<br>
  I have met the Absolute Lord, and congratulations are pouring in. ||1||Pause||<br>
  She is so beautiful, she captivates the mind.<br>
  On the road, and the beach, at home, in the forest and in the wilderness, she touches us.<br>
  She seems so sweet to the mind and body.<br>
  But by Guru's Grace, I have seen her to be deceptive. ||2||<br>
  Her courtiers are also great deceivers.<br>
  They do not spare even their fathers or mothers.<br>

  They dispel suffering; they are givers of the life of the soul.<br>
  They are so brave; they are men of their word.<br>
  The Saints have enticed Maya herself. ||3||<br>
  Their company is cherished even by the gods and the angels.<br>

  Such is the Saalagraam, the stone idol, which I serve;<br>
  such is my worship, flower-offerings and divine adoration as well. ||1||Pause||<br>

  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl, Panch-Pada:<br>
  That highway, upon which the water-carrier is plundered<br>
  - that way is far removed from the Saints. ||1||<br>
  The True Guru has spoken the Truth.<br>
  Your Name, O Lord, is the Way to Salvation; the road of the Messenger of Death is far away. ||1||Pause||<br>
  That place, where the greedy toll-collector dwells<br>
  - that path remains far removed from the Lord's humble servant. ||2||<br>
  There, where so very many caravans of men are caught,<br>
  the Holy Saints remain with the Supreme Lord. ||3||<br>
  Chitra and Gupat, the recording angels of the conscious and the unconscious, write the accounts of all mortal beings,<br>
  but they cannot even see the Lord's humble devotees. ||4||<br>
  Says Nanak, one whose True Guru is Perfect<br>
  - the unblown bugles of ecstasy vibrate for him. ||5||40||91||<br>

  I have entered the Sanctuary of the Creator, the Cause of all causes.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, I have entered the home of celestial bliss. Darkness is dispelled, and the moon of wisdom has risen. ||1||Pause||<br>

  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  The Order of my Husband Lord seems so sweet to me.<br>
  My Husband Lord has driven out the one who was my rival.<br>
  My Beloved Husband has decorated me, His happy soul-bride.<br>
  He has quieted the burning thirst of my mind. ||1||<br>
  It is good that I submitted to the Will of my Beloved Lord.<br>
  I have realized celestial peace and poise within this home of mine. ||Pause||<br>
  I am the hand-maiden, the attendant of my Beloved Lord.<br>
  He is eternal and imperishable, inaccessible and infinite.<br>
  Holding the fan, sitting at His Feet, I wave it over my Beloved.<br>
  The five demons who tortured me have run away. ||2||<br>
  I am not from a noble family, and I am not beautiful.<br>
  What do I know? Why am I pleasing to my Beloved?<br>
  I am a poor orphan, destitute and dishonored.<br>
  My Husband took me in, and made me His queen. ||3||<br>
  When I saw my Beloved's face before me,<br>
  I became so happy and peaceful; my married life was blessed.<br>

  A frown creases her forehead, and her look is evil.<br>

  Such is Maya, the woman, which the One Lord has created.<br>
  She is devouring the whole world, but the Guru has saved me, O my Siblings of Destiny. ||Pause||<br>
  Administering her poisons, she has overcome the whole world.<br>
  She has bewitched Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva.<br>
  Only those Gurmukhs who are attuned to the Naam are blessed. ||2||<br>
  Performing fasts, religious observances and atonements, the mortals have grown weary.<br>
  They wander over the entire planet, on pilgrimages to the banks of sacred rivers.<br>
  But they alone are saved, who seek the Sanctuary of the True Guru. ||3||<br>
  Attached to Maya, the whole world is in bondage.<br>
  The foolish self-willed manmukhs are consumed by their egotism.<br>
  Taking me by the arm, Guru Nanak has saved me. ||4||2||96||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Everything is painful, when one forgets the Lord Master.<br>
  Here and hereafter, such a mortal is useless. ||1||<br>

 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 049</h2></center>
  Bestowing Your Mercy, God, You attach us to Your Name; all peace comes by Your Will. ||Pause||<br>
  The Lord is Ever-present; one who deems Him to be far away, dies again and again, repenting. ||2||<br>
  The mortals do not remember the One, who has given them everything.<br>
  Engrossed in such terrible corruption, their days and nights waste away. ||3||<br>

  My Blissful Lord Master is forever in bliss; meditate continually and forever, on the Lord, the treasure of excellence.<br>
  I am a sacrifice to the Beloved Saints; by their kind favor, God comes to dwell in the mind. ||Pause||<br>
  His gifts are never exhausted.<br>
  In His subtle way, He easily absorbs all.<br>
  His benevolence cannot be erased.<br>
  So enshrine that True Lord within your mind. ||2||<br>
  His house is filled with all sorts of articles;<br>

  The Guru has given honor to the dishonored.<br>
  Shattering his bonds, the Guru has saved His servant.<br>
  I taste with my tongue the Ambrosial Bani of His Word. ||3||<br>

  A son is born - a devotee of the Lord of the Universe.<br>
  This pre-ordained destiny has been revealed to all. ||Pause||<br>
  In the tenth month, by the Lord's Order, the baby has been born.<br>
  Sorrow is dispelled, and great joy has ensued.<br>
  The companions blissfully sing the songs of the Guru's Bani.<br>
  This is pleasing to the Lord Master. ||2||<br>
  The vine has grown, and shall last for many generations.<br>
  The Power of the Dharma has been firmly established by the Lord.<br>
  That which my mind wishes for, the True Guru has granted.<br>
  I have become carefree, and I fix my attention on the One Lord. ||3||<br>

  There is only One Giver; all others are beggars. Who else can we turn to? ||1||<br>
  When I beg from others, I am ashamed.<br>
  The One Lord Master is the Supreme King of all; who else is equal to Him? ||1||Pause||<br>
  Standing up and sitting down, I cannot live without Him. I search and search for the Blessed Vision of His Darshan.<br>
  Even Brahma and the sages Sanak, Sanandan, Sanaatan and Sanat Kumar, find it difficult to obtain the Mansion of the Lord's Presence. ||2||<br>
  He is unapproachable and unfathomable; His wisdom is deep and profound; His value cannot be appraised.<br>
  I have taken to the Sanctuary of the True Lord, the Primal Being, and I meditate on the True Guru. ||3||<br>
  God, the Lord Master, has become kind and compassionate; He has cut the noose of death away from my neck.<br>
  Says Nanak, now that I have obtained the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I shall not have to be reincarnated again. ||4||1||121||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Inwardly, I sing His Praises, and outwardly, I sing His Praises; I sing His Praises while awake and asleep.<br>
  I am a trader in the Name of the Lord of the Universe; He has given it to me as my supplies, to carry with me. ||1||<br>
  I have forgotten and forsaken other things.<br>
  The Perfect Guru has given me the Gift of the Naam; this alone is my Support. ||1||Pause||<br>
  I sing His Praises while suffering, and I sing His Praises while I am at peace as well. I contemplate Him while I walk along the Path.<br>
  The Guru has implanted the Naam within my mind, and my thirst has been quenched. ||2||<br>
  I sing His Praises during the day, and I sing His Praises during the night; I sing them with each and every breath.<br>
  In the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, this faith is established, that the Lord is with us, in life and in death. ||3||<br>
  Bless servant Nanak with this gift, O God, that he may obtain, and enshrine in his heart, the dust of the feet of the Saints.<br>
  Hear the Lord's Sermon with your ears, and behold the Blessed Vision of His Darshan with your eyes; place your forehead upon the Guru's Feet. ||4||2||122||<br>

  That which you believe to be permanent, is a guest here for only a few days.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 056</h2></center>
  Children, wives, homes, and all possessions - attachment to all of these is false. ||1||<br>
  O mind, why do you burst out laughing?<br>
  See with your eyes, that these things are only mirages. So earn the profit of meditation on the One Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  It is like the clothes which you wear on your body - they wear off in a few days.<br>
  How long can you run upon a wall? Ultimately, you come to its end. ||2||<br>
  It is like salt, preserved in its container; when it is put into water, it dissolves.<br>
  When the Order of the Supreme Lord God comes, the soul arises, and departs in an instant. ||3||<br>
  O mind, your steps are numbered, your moments spent sitting are numbered, and the breaths you are to take are numbered.<br>
  Sing forever the Praises of the Lord, O Nanak, and you shall be saved, under the Shelter of the Feet of the True Guru. ||4||1||123||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  That which was upside-down has been set upright; the deadly enemies and adversaries have become friends.<br>
  In the darkness, the jewel shines forth, and the impure understanding has become pure. ||1||<br>
  When the Lord of the Universe became merciful,<br>
  I found peace, wealth and the fruit of the Lord's Name; I have met the True Guru. ||1||Pause||<br>
  No one knew me, the miserable miser, but now, I have become famous all over the world.<br>
  Before, no one would even sit with me, but now, all worship my feet. ||2||<br>
  I used to wander in search of pennies, but now, all the desires of my mind are satisfied.<br>
  I could not bear even one criticism, but now, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I am cooled and soothed. ||3||<br>
  What Glorious Virtues of the Inaccessible, Unfathomable, Profound Lord can one mere tongue describe?<br>
  Please, make me the slave of the slave of Your slaves; servant Nanak seeks the Lord's Sanctuary. ||4||2||124||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  O fool, you are so slow to earn your profits, and so quick to run up losses.<br>
  You do not purchase the inexpensive merchandise; O sinner, you are tied to your debts. ||1||<br>
  O True Guru, You are my only hope.<br>
  Your Name is the Purifier of sinners, O Supreme Lord God; You are my only Shelter. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Listening to the evil talk, you are caught up in it, but you are hesitant to chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<br>
  You are delighted by slanderous talk; your understanding is corrupt. ||2||<br>
  Others' wealth, others' wives and the slander of others - eating the uneatable, you have gone crazy.<br>
  You have not enshrined love for the True Faith of Dharma; hearing the Truth, you are enraged. ||3||<br>
  O God, Merciful to the meek, Compassionate Lord Master, Your Name is the Support of Your devotees.<br>
  Nanak has come to Your Sanctuary; O God, make him Your Own, and preserve his honor. ||4||3||125||<br>

  Wherever they go, they do not think of the Lord; they are blinded by intellectual egotism. ||1||<br>
  O mind, O renunciate, why don't you adore Him?<br>
  You dwell in that flimsy chamber, with all the sins of corruption. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Crying out, "Mine, mine", your days and nights pass away; moment by moment, your life is running out.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 057</h2></center>
  The sweet flavors tempt you, and you are occupied by your false and filthy business. ||2||<br>
  Your senses are beguiled by sensual pleasures of sex, by anger, greed and emotional attachment.<br>
  The All-powerful Architect of Destiny has ordained that you shall be reincarnated over and over again. ||3||<br>
  When the Destroyer of the pains of the poor becomes merciful, then, as Gurmukh, you shall find absolute peace.<br>
  Says Nanak, meditate on the Lord, day and night, and all your sickness shall be banished. ||4||<br>
  Meditate in this way, O Siblings of Destiny, on the Lord, the Architect of Destiny.<br>
  The Destroyer of the pains of the poor has become merciful; He has removed the pains of birth and death. ||1||Second Pause||4||4||126||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  For a moment of sexual pleasure, you shall suffer in pain for millions of days.<br>
  For an instant, you may savor pleasure, but afterwards, you shall regret it, again and again. ||1||<br>
  O blind man, meditate on the Lord, the Lord, your King.<br>
  Your day is drawing near. ||1||Pause||<br>
  You are deceived, beholding with your eyes, the bitter melon and swallow-wort.<br>
  But, like the companionship of a poisonous snake, so is the desire for another's spouse. ||2||<br>
  For the sake of your enemy, you commit sins, while you neglect the reality of your faith.<br>
  Your friendship is with those who abandon you, and you are angry with your friends. ||3||<br>
  The entire world is entangled in this way; he alone is saved, who has the Perfect Guru.<br>
  Says Nanak, I have crossed over the terrifying world-ocean; my body has become sanctified. ||4||5||127||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl Dupadas:<br>
  O Lord, You behold whatever we do in secrecy; the fool may stubbornly deny it.<br>
  By his own actions, he is tied down, and in the end, he regrets and repents. ||1||<br>
  My God knows, ahead of time, all things.<br>
  Deceived by doubt, you may hide your actions, but in the end, you shall have to confess the secrets of your mind. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Whatever they are attached to, they remain joined to that. What can any mere mortal do?<br>
  Please, forgive me, O Supreme Lord Master. Nanak is forever a sacrifice to You. ||2||6||128||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  He Himself preserves His servants; He causes them to chant His Name.<br>
  Wherever the business and affairs of His servants are, there the Lord hurries to be. ||1||<br>
  The Lord appears near at hand to His servant.<br>
  Whatever the servant asks of his Lord and Master, immediately comes to pass. ||1||Pause||<br>
  I am a sacrifice to that servant, who is pleasing to his God.<br>
  Hearing of his glory, the mind is rejuvenated; Nanak comes to touch his feet. ||2||7||129||<br>

  O Saints, my friends and companions, without the Lord, Har, Har, you shall perish.<br>
  Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and win this precious treasure of human life. ||1||Pause||<br>
  God has created Maya of the three qualities; tell me, how can it be crossed over?<br>
  The whirlpool is awesome and unfathomable; only through the Word of the Guru's Shabad is one carried across. ||2||<br>
  Searching and searching endlessly, seeking and deliberating, Nanak has realized the true essence of reality.<br>
  Meditating on the invaluable treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the jewel of the mind is satisfied. ||3||1||130||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl, Dupadas:<br>
  By Guru's Grace, He dwells within my mind; whatever I ask for, I receive.<br>
  This mind is satisfied with the Love of the Naam, the Name of the Lord; it does not go out, anywhere, anymore. ||1||<br>
  My Lord and Master is the highest of all; night and day, I sing the Glories of His Praises.<br>
  In an instant, He establishes and disestablishes; through Him, I frighten you. ||1||Pause||<br>
  When I behold my God, my Lord and Master, I do not pay any attention to any other.<br>
  God Himself has adorned servant Nanak; his doubts and fears have been dispelled, and he writes the account of the Lord. ||2||2||131||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  The four castes and social classes, and the preachers with the six Shaastras on their finger-tips,<br>
  the beautiful, the refined, the shapely and the wise - the five passions have enticed and beguiled them all. ||1||<br>
  Who has seized and conquered the five powerful fighters? Is there anyone strong enough?<br>
  He alone, who conquers and defeats the five demons, is perfect in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga. ||1||Pause||<br>
  They are so awesome and great; they cannot be controlled, and they do not run away. Their army is mighty and unyielding.<br>
  Says Nanak, that humble being who is under the protection of the Saadh Sangat, crushes those terrible demons. ||2||3||132||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  The Sublime Sermon of the Lord is the best thing for the soul. All other tastes are insipid. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The worthy beings, heavenly singers, silent sages and the knowers of the six Shaastras proclaim that nothing else is worthy of consideration. ||1||<br>
  It is the cure for evil passions, unique, unequalled and peace-giving; in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, O Nanak, drink it in. ||2||4||133||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  My Beloved has brought forth a river of nectar. The Guru has not held it back from my mind, even for an instant. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Beholding it, and touching it, I am sweetened and delighted. It is imbued with the Creator's Love. ||1||<br>
  Chanting it even for a moment, I rise to the Guru; meditating on it, one is not trapped by the Messenger of Death. The Lord has placed it as a garland around Nanak's neck, and within his heart. ||2||5||134||<br>
  Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:<br>
  The Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, is exalted and sublime. ||Pause||<br>
  Every day, hour and moment, I continually sing and speak of Govind, Govind, the Lord of the Universe. ||1||<br>
  Walking, sitting and sleeping, I chant the Lord's Praises; I treasure His Feet in my mind and body. ||2||<br>

  He alone obtains the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, unto whom God shows His Mercy. ||3||<br>
  The One Lord is my Anchor and Support; the One Lord alone is the power of my mind.<br>

  Here and hereafter, He is our Helper and Companion; embrace love and affection for the One Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  They meditate on the Vedas and the Shaastras, to swim across the world-ocean.<br>
  The many religious rituals, good deeds of karma and Dharmic worship - above all of these is the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||2||<br>
  Sexual desire, anger, and egotism depart, meeting with the Divine True Guru.<br>
  Implant the Naam within, perform devotional worship to the Lord and serve God - this is good. ||3||<br>
  I seek the Sanctuary of Your Feet, O Merciful Lord; You are the Honor of the dishonored.<br>

  You Yourself are the Creator, who established the entire world. You are contained in all.<br>
  The Righteous Judge of Dharma is wonder-struck, at the sight of everyone falling at the Lord's Feet. ||2||<br>
  The Golden Age of Sat Yuga, the Silver Age of Trayta Yuga, and the Brass Age of Dwaapar Yuga are good; but the best is the Dark Age, the Iron Age, of Kali Yuga.<br>

  Those who are attached to the poison of greed and sin grab at the wealth of others; they only bring pain on themselves.<br>
  They are intoxicated by their pride in those things which shall be destroyed in an instant; those demons do not understand. ||1||Pause||<br>

  One moment, O Nanak, the Lord bestows His Mercy and blesses him with His Love, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||2||5||156||<br>

  Turn away from others, and turn to Him.<br>
  Thus you shall obtain your Beloved, O my companion. ||1||Pause||<br>
  In the pool of the world is the mud of attachment.<br>

  The fear of death is dispelled,<br>
  and the primal place is obtained.<br>
  Then, all subservience is removed. ||1||<br>
  One who has such destiny recorded upon his forehead, obtains it;<br>
  he crosses over the terrifying ocean of fire.<br>

  The silent sages search for Him.<br>
  God is the Master of all.<br>
  It is so difficult to find Him in this world, in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga.<br>

  God is the Fulfiller of desires, O my mind. ||1||<br>
  O my mind, serve Him.<br>

  He is known only through the Guru.<br>

  He has showered His Mercy upon me.<br>

  No one is bad.<br>

  He Himself preserves those<br>

  One who has no one to call his own<br>

  Whatever you are attached to,<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 065</h2></center>
  you shall have to leave it all behind.<br>
  These things seem like only a dream,<br>
  to one who takes the Lord's Name. ||1||<br>
  Forsaking the Lord, and clinging to another,<br>
  they run toward death and reincarnation.<br>
  But those humble beings, who attach themselves to the Lord, Har, Har,<br>
  continue to live.<br>
  One who is blessed with the Lord's Mercy,<br>
  O Nanak, becomes His devotee. ||2||7||163||232||<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Raag Aasaa, Ninth Mehl:<br>
  Who should I tell the condition of the mind?<br>
  Engrossed in greed, running around in the ten directions, you hold to your hopes of wealth. ||1||Pause||<br>
  For the sake of pleasure, you suffer such great pain, and you have to serve each and every person.<br>
  You wander from door to door like a dog, unconscious of the Lord's meditation. ||1||<br>
  You lose this human life in vain, and You are not even ashamed when others laugh at you.<br>
  O Nanak, why not sing the Lord's Praises, so that you may be rid of the body's evil disposition? ||2||1||233||<br>
  Raag Aasaa, First Mehl, Ashtapadees, Second House:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  He descends the treacherous precipice, to bathe in the cleansing pool;<br>
  without speaking or saying anything, he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord.<br>
  Like water vapor in the sky, he remains absorbed in the Lord.<br>
  He churns the true pleasures to obtain the supreme nectar. ||1||<br>
  Listen to such spiritual wisdom, O my mind.<br>
  The Lord is totally pervading and permeating all places. ||1||Pause||<br>
  One who makes Truthfulness his fast and religious vows, does not suffer the pain of death.<br>
  Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, he burns away his anger.<br>
  He dwells in the Tenth Gate, immersed in the Samaadhi of deep meditation.<br>
  Touching the philosopher's stone, he obtains the supreme status. ||2||<br>
  For the benefit of the mind, churn the true essence of reality;<br>
  bathing in the over-flowing tank of nectar, filth is washed away.<br>
  We become like the One with whom we are imbued.<br>
  Whatever the Creator does, comes to pass. ||3||<br>
  The Guru is cool and soothing like ice; He puts out the fire of the mind.<br>
  Smear your body with the ashes of dedicated service,<br>
  and live in the home of peace - make this your religious order.<br>
  Let the Immaculate Bani of the Word be your playing of the flute. ||4||<br>
  Spiritual wisdom within is the supreme, sublime nectar.<br>
  Contemplation of the Guru is one's bathing at holy places of pilgrimage.<br>
  Worship and adoration within is the Lord's dwelling.<br>
  He is the One who blends one's light with the Divine Light. ||5||<br>
  He delights in the delightful wisdom of loving the One Lord.<br>
  He is one of the self-elect - he merges with the Lord, who occupies the throne.<br>
  He performs his works in obedience to the Will of his Lord and Master.<br>
  The Unknowable Lord cannot be understood. ||6||<br>
  The lotus originates in the water, and yet it remains distinct from the water.<br>
  Just so, the Divine Light pervades and permeates the water of the world.<br>
  Who is near, and who is far away?<br>
  I sing the Glories of the Lord, the treasure of virtue; I behold Him ever-present. ||7||<br>
  Inwardly and outwardly, there is none other than Him.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 066</h2></center>
  Whatever pleases Him, comes to pass.<br>
  Listen, O Bharthari Yogi - Nanak speaks after deliberation;<br>
  the Immaculate Name is my only Support. ||8||1||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl:<br>
  All meditation, all austerities, and all clever tricks,<br>
  lead one to wander in the wilderness, but he does not find the Path.<br>
  Without understanding, he is not approved;<br>
  without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, ashes are thrown upon one's head. ||1||<br>
  True is the Master; the world comes and goes.<br>
  The mortal is emancipated, as Gurmukh, as the Lord's slave. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The world is bound by its attachments to the many desires.<br>
  Through the Guru's Teachings, some become free of desire.<br>
  Within them is the Naam, and their heart lotus blossoms forth.<br>
  They have no fear of death. ||2||<br>
  The men of the world are conquered by woman; they love the ladies.<br>
  Attached to children and wife, they forget the Naam.<br>
  They waste this human life in vain, and lose the game in the gamble.<br>
  Serving the True Guru is the best occupation. ||3||<br>
  One who speaks egotistically in public,<br>
  never attains liberation within.<br>
  One who burns away his attachment to Maya, by the Word of the Guru's Shabad,<br>
  meditates forever within his heart on the Immaculate Naam. ||4||<br>
  He restrains his wandering mind, and keeps it under control.<br>
  The company of such a Sikh is obtained only by Grace.<br>
  Without the Guru, he goes astray and continues coming and going.<br>
  Bestowing His Mercy, the Lord unites him in Union. ||5||<br>
  I cannot describe the Beauteous Lord.<br>
  I speak the unspoken; I cannot estimate His value.<br>
  All pain and pleasure come by Your Will.<br>
  All pain is eradicated by the True Name. ||6||<br>
  He plays the instrument without hands, and dances without feet.<br>
  But if he understands the Word of the Shabad, then he shall behold the True Lord.<br>
  With the True Lord within the self, all happiness comes.<br>
  Showering His Mercy, the Preserving Lord preserves him. ||7||<br>
  He understands the three worlds; he eliminates his self-conceit.<br>
  He understands the Bani of the Word, and he is absorbed into the True Lord.<br>
  Contemplating the Shabad, he enshrines love for the One Lord.<br>
  O Nanak, blessed is the Lord, the Embellisher. ||8||2||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl:<br>
  There are innumerable writings; those who write them take pride in them.<br>
  When one's mind accepts the Truth, he understands, and speaks of it.<br>
  Words, spoken and read again and again, are useless loads.<br>
  There are innumerable writings, but the Infinite Lord remains unwritten. ||1||<br>
  Know that such a True Lord is the One and only.<br>
  Understand that birth and death come according to the Lord's Will. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Because of attachment to Maya, the world is bound by the Messenger of Death.<br>
  These bonds are released when one remembers the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<br>
  The Guru is the Giver of peace; do not look for any other.<br>
  In this world, and the next, He shall stand by you. ||2||<br>
  One who dies in the Word of the Shabad, embraces love for the One Lord.<br>
  One who eats the uneatable, has his doubts dispelled.<br>
  He is Jivan Mukta - liberated while yet alive; the Naam abides in his mind.<br>
  Becoming Gurmukh, he merges into the True Lord. ||3||<br>
  The One who created the earth and the Akaashic ethers of the sky,<br>
  established all; He establishes and disestablishes.<br>
  He Himself is permeating all.<br>
  He does not consult anyone; He Himself forgives. ||4||<br>
  You are the Ocean, over-flowing with jewels and rubies.<br>
  You are immaculate and pure, the true treasure of virtue.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 067</h2></center>
  Peace is enjoyed, meeting the Guru, the Spiritual Teacher.<br>
  The Lord is the only Master; He is the only Minister. ||5||<br>
  The world is held in bondage; he alone is emancipated, who conquers his ego.<br>
  How rare in the world is that wise person, who practices this.<br>
  How rare in this world is that scholar who reflects upon this.<br>
  Without meeting the True Guru, all wander in ego. ||6||<br>
  The world is unhappy; only a few are happy.<br>
  The world is diseased, from its indulgences; it weeps over its lost virtue.<br>
  The world wells up, and then subsides, losing its honor.<br>
  He alone, who becomes Gurmukh, understands. ||7||<br>
  His price is so costly; His weight is unbearable.<br>
  He is immovable and undeceivable; enshrine Him in your mind, through the Guru's Teachings.<br>
  Meet Him through love, become pleasing to Him, and act in fear of Him.<br>
  Nanak the lowly says this, after deep contemplation. ||8||3||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl:<br>
  When someone dies, the five passions meet and mourn his death.<br>
  Overcoming self-conceit, he washes off his filth with the Word of the Shabad.<br>
  One who knows and understands, enters the home of peace and poise.<br>
  Without understanding, he loses all his honor. ||1||<br>
  Who dies, and who weeps for him?<br>
  O Lord, Creator, Cause of causes, You are over the heads of all. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Who weeps over the pain of the dead?<br>
  Those who weep, do so over their own troubles.<br>
  God knows the condition of those who are so affected.<br>
  Whatever the Creator does, comes to pass. ||2||<br>
  One who remains dead while yet alive, is saved, and saves others as well.<br>
  Celebrate the Victory of the Lord; taking to His Sanctuary, the supreme status is obtained.<br>
  I am a sacrifice to the feet of the True Guru.<br>
  The Guru is the boat; through the Shabad of His Word, the terrifying world-ocean is crossed over. ||3||<br>
  He Himself is Fearless; His Divine Light is contained in all.<br>
  Without the Name, the world is defiled and untouchable.<br>
  Through evil-mindedness, they are ruined; why should they cry out and weep?<br>
  They are born only to die, without hearing the music of devotional worship. ||4||<br>
  Only one's true friends mourn one's death.<br>
  Those under the sway of the three dispositions continue to mourn on and on.<br>
  Disregarding pain and pleasure, center your consciousness on the Lord.<br>
  Dedicate your body and mind to the Love of the Lord. ||5||<br>
  The One Lord dwells within the various and countless beings.<br>
  There are so many rituals and religious faiths, their number is innumerable.<br>
  Without the Fear of God, and devotional worship, one's life is in vain.<br>
  Singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, the supreme wealth is obtained. ||6||<br>
  He Himself dies, and He Himself kills.<br>
  He Himself establishes, and having established, disestablishes.<br>
  He created the Universe, and by His Divine Nature, instilled His Divine Light into it.<br>
  One who reflects upon the Word of the Shabad, meets the Lord, without doubt. ||7||<br>
  Pollution is the burning fire, which is consuming the world.<br>
  Pollution is in the water, upon the land, and everywhere.<br>
  O Nanak, people are born and die in pollution.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, they drink in the Lord's sublime elixir. ||8||4||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl:<br>
  One who contemplates his own self, tests the worth of the jewel.<br>
  With a single glance, the Perfect Guru saves him.<br>
  When the Guru is pleased, one's mind comforts itself. ||1||<br>
  He is such a banker, who tests us.<br>
  By His True Glance of Grace, we are blessed with the Love of the One Lord, and are saved. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The capital of the Naam is immaculate and sublime.<br>
  That peddler is rendered pure, who is imbued with the Truth.<br>
  Praising the Lord, in the house of poise, he attains the Guru, the Creator. ||2||<br>
  One who burns away hope and desire through the Word of the Shabad,<br>
  chants the Lord's Name, and inspires others to chant it as well.<br>
  Through the Guru, he finds the Path home, to the Mansion of the Lord's Presence. ||3||<br>

  His body becomes golden, by the Lord's Incomparable Light.<br>
  He beholds the divine beauty in all the three worlds.<br>

  In the five elements, the three worlds, the nine regions and the four directions, the Lord is pervading.<br>
  He supports the earth and the sky, exercising His almighty power.<br>
  He turns the outgoing mind around. ||5||<br>
  The fool does not realize what he sees with his eyes.<br>
  He does not taste with his tongue, and does not understand what is said.<br>
  Intoxicated with poison, he argues with the world. ||6||<br>
  In the uplifting society, one is uplifted.<br>
  He chases after virtue and washes off his sins.<br>
  Without serving the Guru, celestial poise is not obtained. ||7||<br>
  The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is a diamond, a jewel, a ruby.<br>
  The pearl of the mind is the inner wealth.<br>
  O Nanak, the Lord tests us, and blesses us with His Glance of Grace. ||8||5||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl:<br>
  The Gurmukh obtains spiritual wisdom, meditation and satisfaction of the mind.<br>
  The Gurmukh realizes the Mansion of the Lord's Presence.<br>

  Such is the loving devotional worship of the Lord's contemplation.<br>

  Day and night, he remains immaculately pure, and abides in the sublime place.<br>
  He gains the wisdom of the three worlds.<br>
  Through the True Guru, the Command of the Lord's Will is realized. ||2||<br>
  He enjoys true pleasure, and suffers no pain.<br>
  He enjoys the ambrosial wisdom, and the highest sublime essence.<br>
  He overcomes the five evil passions, and becomes the happiest of all men. ||3||<br>
  Your Divine Light is contained in all; everyone belongs to You.<br>
  You Yourself join and separate again.<br>
  Whatever the Creator does, comes to pass. ||4||<br>
  He demolishes, and He builds; by His Order, he merges us into Himself.<br>
  Whatever is pleasing to His Will, happens.<br>
  Without the Guru, no one obtains the Perfect Lord. ||5||<br>
  In childhood and old age, he does not understand.<br>
  In the prime of youth, he is drowned in his pride.<br>
  Without the Name, what can the fool obtain? ||6||<br>
  He does not know the One who blesses him with nourishment and wealth.<br>
  Deluded by doubt, he later regrets and repents.<br>
  The noose of death is around the neck of that crazy madman. ||7||<br>
  I saw the world drowning, and I ran away in fear.<br>
  How very fortunate are those who have been saved by the True Guru.<br>
  O Nanak, they are attached to the feet of the Guru. ||8||6||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl:<br>
  They sing religious songs, but their consciousness is wicked.<br>
  They sing the songs, and call themselves divine,<br>
  but without the Name, their minds are false and wicked. ||1||<br>
  Where are you going? O mind, remain in your own home.<br>
  The Gurmukhs are satisfied with the Lord's Name; searching, they easily find the Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Sexual desire, anger and emotional attachment fill the mind and body;<br>
  greed and egotism lead only to pain.<br>
  How can the mind be comforted without the Lord's Name? ||2||<br>
  One who cleanses himself within, knows the True Lord.<br>
  The Gurmukh knows the condition of his innermost being.<br>
  Without the True Word of the Shabad, the Mansion of the Lord's Presence is not realized. ||3||<br>
  One who merges his form into the Formless Lord,<br>

  The mind is diseased with doubt, superstition and duality.<br>
  Without the Guru, it dwells in doubt, and contemplates duality.<br>
  The Guru reveals the Darshan, the Blessed Vision of the Primal Lord.<br>
  Without the Word of the Guru's Shabad, what use is human life? ||5||<br>
  Beholding the Marvellous Lord, I am wonder-struck and astonished.<br>
  In each and every heart, of the angels and holy men, He dwells in celestial Samaadhi.<br>
  I have enshrined the All-pervading Lord within my mind.<br>
  There is no one else equal to You. ||6||<br>
  For the sake of devotional worship, we chant Your Name.<br>
  The Lord's devotees dwell in the Society of the Saints.<br>
  Breaking his bonds, one comes to meditate on the Lord.<br>
  The Gurmukhs are emancipated, by the Guru-given knowledge of the Lord. ||7||<br>
  The Messenger of Death cannot touch him with pain;<br>
  the Lord's humble servant remains awake to the Love of the Naam.<br>
  The Lord is the Lover of His devotees; He dwells with His devotees.<br>
  O Nanak, they are liberated, through the Love of the Lord. ||8||9||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl, Ik-Tukee:<br>
  One who serves the Guru, knows his Lord and Master.<br>
  His pains are erased, and he realizes the True Word of the Shabad. ||1||<br>
  Meditate on the Lord, O my friends and companions.<br>
  Serving the True Guru, you shall behold God with your eyes. ||1||Pause||<br>
  People are entangled with mother, father and the world.<br>
  They are entangled with sons, daughters and spouses. ||2||<br>
  They are entangled with religious rituals, and religious faith, acting in ego.<br>
  They are entangled with sons, wives and others in their minds. ||3||<br>
  The farmers are entangled by farming.<br>
  People suffer punishment in ego, and the Lord King exacts the penalty from them. ||4||<br>
  They are entangled in trade without contemplation.<br>
  They are not satisfied by attachment to the expanse of Maya. ||5||<br>
  They are entangled with that wealth, amassed by bankers.<br>
  Without devotion to the Lord, they do not become acceptable. ||6||<br>
  They are entangled with the Vedas, religious discussions and egotism.<br>
  They are entangled, and perish in attachment and corruption. ||7||<br>
  Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of the Lord's Name.<br>
  One who is saved by the True Guru, does not suffer entanglement. ||8||10||<br>

  They lived in palatial mansions, but now, they cannot even sit near the palaces. ||1||<br>
  Hail to You, O Father Lord, Hail to You!<br>
  O Primal Lord. Your limits are not known; You create, and create, and behold the scenes. ||1||Pause||<br>
  When they were married, their husbands looked so handsome beside them.<br>
  They came in palanquins, decorated with ivory;<br>
  water was sprinkled over their heads, and glittering fans were waved above them. ||2||<br>
  They were given hundreds of thousands of coins when they sat, and hundreds of thousands of coins when they stood.<br>
  They ate coconuts and dates, and rested comfortably upon their beds.<br>
  But ropes were put around their necks, and their strings of pearls were broken. ||3||<br>
  Their wealth and youthful beauty, which gave them so much pleasure, have now become their enemies.<br>
  The order was given to the soldiers, who dishonored them, and carried them away.<br>
  If it is pleasing to God's Will, He bestows greatness; if is pleases His Will, He bestows punishment. ||4||<br>
  If someone focuses on the Lord beforehand, then why should he be punished?<br>
  The kings had lost their higher consciousness, reveling in pleasure and sensuality.<br>
  Since Baabar's rule has been proclaimed, even the princes have no food to eat. ||5||<br>
  The Muslims have lost their five times of daily prayer, and the Hindus have lost their worship as well.<br>
  Without their sacred squares, how shall the Hindu women bathe and apply the frontal marks to their foreheads?<br>
  They never remembered their Lord as Raam, and now they cannot even chant Khudaa-i||6||<br>
  Some have returned to their homes, and meeting their relatives, they ask about their safety.<br>
  For some, it is pre-ordained that they shall sit and cry out in pain.<br>
  Whatever pleases Him, comes to pass. O Nanak, what is the fate of mankind? ||7||11||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl:<br>
  Where are the games, the stables, the horses? Where are the drums and the bugles?<br>
  Where are the sword-belts and chariots? Where are those scarlet uniforms?<br>
  Where are the rings and the beautiful faces? They are no longer to be seen here. ||1||<br>
  This world is Yours; You are the Lord of the Universe.<br>
  In an instant, You establish and disestablish. You distribute wealth as it pleases You. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Where are the houses, the gates, the hotels and palaces? Where are those beautiful way-stations?<br>
  Where are those beautiful women, reclining on their beds, whose beauty would not allow one to sleep?<br>
  Where are those betel leaves, their sellers, and the haremees? They have vanished like shadows. ||2||<br>
  For the sake of this wealth, so many were ruined; because of this wealth, so many have been disgraced.<br>
  It was not gathered without sin, and it does not go along with the dead.<br>
  Those, whom the Creator Lord would destroy - first He strips them of virtue. ||3||<br>

  None of the Mugals went blind, and no one performed any miracle. ||4||<br>
  The battle raged between the Mugals and the Pat'haans, and the swords clashed on the battlefield.<br>
  They took aim and fired their guns, and they attacked with their elephants.<br>
  Those men whose letters were torn in the Lord's Court, were destined to die, O Siblings of Destiny. ||5||<br>
  The Hindu women, the Muslim women, the Bhattis and the Rajputs<br>
  - some had their robes torn away, from head to foot, while others came to dwell in the cremation ground.<br>
  Their husbands did not return home - how did they pass their night? ||6||<br>
  The Creator Himself acts, and causes others to act. Unto whom should we complain?<br>
  Pleasure and pain come by Your Will; unto whom should we go and cry?<br>
  The Commander issues His Command, and is pleased. O Nanak, we receive what is written in our destiny. ||7||12||<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>

  As the shepherd is in the field for only a short time, so is one in the world.<br>
  Practicing falsehood, they build their homes. ||1||<br>
  Wake up! Wake up! O sleepers, see that the travelling merchant is leaving. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Go ahead and build your houses, if you think you will stay here forever and ever.<br>
  The body shall fall, and the soul shall depart; if only they knew this. ||2||<br>
  Why do you cry out and mourn for the dead? The Lord is, and shall always be.<br>
  You mourn for that person, but who will mourn for you? ||3||<br>
  You are engrossed in worldly entanglements, O Siblings of Destiny, and you are practicing falsehood.<br>
  The dead person does not hear anything at all; your cries are heard only by other people. ||4||<br>
  Only the Lord, who causes the mortal to sleep, O Nanak, can awaken him again.<br>
  One who understands his true home, does not sleep. ||5||<br>
  If the departing mortal can take his wealth with him,<br>
  then go ahead and gather wealth yourself. See this, reflect upon it, and understand. ||6||<br>
  Make your deals, and obtain the true merchandise, or else you shall regret it later.<br>
  Abandon your vices, and practice virtue, and you shall obtain the essence of reality. ||7||<br>
  Plant the seed of Truth in the soil of Dharmic faith, and practice such farming.<br>
  Only then will you be known as a merchant, if you take your profits with you. ||8||<br>
  If the Lord shows His Mercy, one meets the True Guru; contemplating Him, one comes to understand.<br>
  Then, one chants the Naam, hears the Naam, and deals only in the Naam. ||9||<br>
  As is the profit, so is the loss; this is the way of the world.<br>
  Whatever pleases His Will, O Nanak, is glory for me. ||10||13||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl:<br>
  I have searched in the four directions, but no one is mine.<br>
  If it pleases You, O Lord Master, then You are mine, and I am Yours. ||1||<br>
  There is no other door for me; where shall I go to worship?<br>
  You are my only Lord; Your True Name is in my mouth. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Some serve the Siddhas, the beings of spiritual perfection, and some serve spiritual teachers; they beg for wealth and miraculous powers.<br>
  May I never forget the Naam, the Name of the One Lord. This is the wisdom of the True Guru. ||2||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 073</h2></center>
  Why do the Yogis, the revellers, and the beggars wander in foreign lands?<br>
  They do not understand the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and the essence of excellence within them. ||3||<br>
  The Pandits, the religious scholars, the teachers and astrologers, and those who endlessly read the Puraanas,<br>
  do not know what is within; God is hidden deep within them. ||4||<br>
  Some penitents perform penance in the forests, and some dwell forever at sacred shrines.<br>
  The unenlightened people do not understand themselves - why have they become renunciates? ||5||<br>
  Some control their sexual energy, and are known as celibates.<br>
  But without the Guru's Word, they are not saved, and they wander in reincarnation. ||6||<br>
  Some are householders, servants, and seekers, attached to the Guru's Teachings.<br>
  They hold fast to the Naam, to charity, to cleansing and purification; they remain awake in devotion to the Lord. ||7||<br>
  Through the Guru, the Gate of the Lord's Home is found, and that place is recognized.<br>
  Nanak does not forget the Naam; his mind has surrendered to the True Lord. ||8||14||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl:<br>
  Stilling the desires of the mind, the mortal truly crosses over the terrifying world-ocean.<br>
  In the very beginning, and throughout the ages, You have been the Merciful Lord and Master; I seek Your Sanctuary. ||1||<br>
  You are the Giver, and I am a mere beggar. Lord, please grant me the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan.<br>
  The Gurmukh meditates on the Naam; the temple of his mind resounds with joy. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Renouncing false greed, one comes to realize the Truth.<br>
  So let yourself be absorbed in the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and know this supreme realization. ||2||<br>
  This mind is a greedy king, engrossed in greed.<br>
  The Gurmukh eliminates his greed, and comes to an understanding with the Lord. ||3||<br>
  Planting the seeds in the rocky soil, how can one reap a profit?<br>
  The self-willed manmukh is not pleased with Truth; the false are buried in falsehood. ||4||<br>
  So renounce greed - you are blind! Greed only brings pain.<br>
  When the True Lord dwells within the mind, the poisonous ego is conquered. ||5||<br>
  Renounce the evil way of duality, or you shall be plundered, O Siblings of Destiny.<br>
  Day and night, praise the Naam, in the Sanctuary of the True Guru's protection. ||6||<br>
  The self-willed manmukh is a rock, a stone. His life is cursed and useless.<br>
  No matter now long a stone is kept under water, it still remains dry at its core. ||7||<br>
  The Name of the Lord is the treasure; the Perfect Guru has given it to me.<br>
  O Nanak, one who does not forget the Naam, churns and drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar. ||8||15||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl:<br>
  The travellers travel from one road to another.<br>
  The world is engrossed in its entanglements, and does not appreciate the Truth. ||1||<br>
  Why wander around, and why go searching, when the Guru's Shabad reveals Him to us?<br>
  Leaving behind egotism and attachment, I have arrived at my own home. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Through Truth, one meets the True One; He is not obtained through falsehood.<br>
  Centering your consciousness on the True Lord, you shall not have to come into the world again. ||2||<br>
  Why do you weep for the dead? You do not know how to weep.<br>
  Weep by praising the True Lord, and recognize His Command. ||3||<br>
  Blessed is the birth of one who is destined to abide by the Lord's Command.<br>
  He obtains the true profit, realizing the Lord's Command. ||4||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 074</h2></center>
  If it pleases the Commander, one goes to His Court, robed in honor.<br>
  By His Command, God's slaves are hit over the head. ||5||<br>
  The profit is earned by enshrining Truth and justice in the mind.<br>
  They obtain what is written in their destiny, and overcome pride. ||6||<br>
  The self-willed manmukhs are hit over the head, and consumed by conflict.<br>
  The cheaters are plundered by falsehood; they are chained and led away. ||7||<br>
  Enshrine the Lord Master in your mind, and you shall not have to repent.<br>
  He forgives our sins, when we practice the Teachings of the Guru's Word. ||8||<br>
  Nanak begs for the True Name, which is obtained by the Gurmukh.<br>
  Without You, I have no other at all; please, bless me with Your Glance of Grace. ||9||16||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl:<br>
  Why should I go searching in the forests, when the woods of my home are so green?<br>
  The True Word of the Shabad has instantaneously come and settled in my heart. ||1||<br>
  Wherever I look, there He is; I know no other.<br>
  Working for the Guru, one realizes the Mansion of the Lord's Presence. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The True Lord blends us with Himself, when it is pleasing to His Mind.<br>
  One who ever walks in accordance with His Will, merges into His Being. ||2||<br>
  When the True Lord dwells in the mind, that mind flourishes.<br>
  He Himself grants greatness; His Gifts are never exhausted. ||3||<br>
  Serving this and that person, how can one obtain the Lord's Court?<br>
  If someone embarks on a boat of stone, he shall drown with its cargo. ||4||<br>
  So offer your mind, and surrender your head with it.<br>
  The Gurmukh realizes the true essence, and finds the home of his own self. ||5||<br>
  People discuss birth and death; the Creator created this.<br>
  Those who conquer their selfhood and remain dead, shall never have to die again. ||6||<br>
  Do those deeds which the Primal Lord has ordered for you.<br>
  If one surrenders his mind upon meeting the True Guru, who can estimate its value? ||7||<br>
  That Lord Master is the Assayer of the jewel of the mind; He places the value on it.<br>
  O Nanak, True is the Glory of that one, in whose mind the Lord Master dwells. ||8||17||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl:<br>
  Those who have forgotten the Naam, the Name of the Lord, are deluded by doubt and duality.<br>
  Those who abandon the roots and cling to the branches, shall obtain only ashes. ||1||<br>
  Without the Name, how can one be emancipated? Who knows this?<br>
  One who becomes Gurmukh is emancipated; the self-willed manmukhs lose their honor. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Those who serve the One Lord become perfect in their understanding, O Siblings of Destiny.<br>
  The Lord's humble servant finds Sanctuary in Him, the Immaculate One, from the very beginning, and throughout the ages. ||2||<br>
  My Lord and Master is the One; there is no other, O Siblings of Destiny.<br>
  By the Grace of the True Lord, celestial peace is obtained. ||3||<br>
  Without the Guru, no one has obtained Him, although many may claim to have done so.<br>
  He Himself reveals the Way, and implants true devotion within. ||4||<br>
  Even if the self-willed manmukh is instructed, he stills goes into the wilderness.<br>
  Without the Lord's Name, he shall not be emancipated; he shall die, and sink into hell. ||5||<br>
  He wanders through birth and death, and never chants the Lord's Name.<br>
  He never realizes his own value, without serving the Guru. ||6||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 075</h2></center>
  Whatever service the Lord causes us to do, that is just what we do.<br>
  He Himself acts; who else should be mentioned? He beholds His own greatness. ||7||<br>
  He alone serves the Guru, whom the Lord Himself inspires to do so.<br>
  O Nanak, offering his head, one is emancipated, and honored in the Court of the Lord. ||8||18||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl:<br>
  Beautiful is the Supreme Lord and Master, and beautiful is the Word of the Guru's Bani.<br>
  By great good fortune, one meets the True Guru, and the supreme status of Nirvaanaa is obtained. ||1||<br>
  I am the lowest slave of Your slaves; I am Your most humble servant.<br>
  As You keep me, I live. Your Name is in my mouth. ||1||Pause||<br>
  I have such a great thirst for the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan; my mind accepts Your Will, and so You are pleased with me.<br>
  Greatness is in the Hands of my Lord and Master; by His Will, honor is obtained. ||2||<br>
  Do not think that the True Lord is far away; He is deep within.<br>
  Wherever I look, there I find Him pervading; how can I estimate His value? ||3||<br>
  He Himself does, and He Himself undoes. He Himself beholds His glorious greatness.<br>
  Becoming Gurmukh, one beholds Him, and so, His value is appraised. ||4||<br>
  So earn your profits while you are alive, by serving the Guru.<br>
  If it is so pre-ordained, then one finds the True Guru. ||5||<br>
  The self-willed manmukhs continually lose, and wander around, deluded by doubt.<br>
  The blind manmukhs do not remember the Lord; how can they obtain the Blessed Vision of His Darshan? ||6||<br>
  One's coming into the world is judged worthwhile only if one lovingly attunes oneself to the True Lord.<br>
  Meeting the Guru, one becomes invaluable; his light merges into the Light. ||7||<br>
  Day and night, he remains detached, and serves the Primal Lord.<br>
  O Nanak, those who are imbued with the Lord's Lotus Feet, are content with the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||8||19||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl:<br>
  No matter how much one may describe the Lord, His limits still cannot be known.<br>
  I am without any support; You, O Lord, are my only Support; You are my almighty power. ||1||<br>
  This is Nanak's prayer, that he may be adorned with the True Name.<br>
  When self-conceit is eradicated, and understanding is obtained, one meets the Lord, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Abandoning egotism and pride, one obtains contemplative understanding.<br>
  When the mind surrenders to the Lord Master, He bestows the support of the Truth. ||2||<br>
  Day and night, remain content with the Naam, the Name of the Lord; that is the true service.<br>
  No misfortune troubles one who follows the Command of the Lord's Will. ||3||<br>
  One who follows the Command of the Lord's Will is taken into the Lord's Treasury.<br>
  The counterfeit find no place there; they are mixed with the false ones. ||4||<br>
  Forever and ever, the genuine coins are treasured; with them, the true merchandise is purchased.<br>
  The false ones are not seen in the Lord's Treasury; they are seized and cast into the fire again. ||5||<br>
  Those who understand their own souls, are themselves the Supreme Soul.<br>
  The One Lord is the tree of ambrosial nectar, which bears the ambrosial fruit. ||6||<br>
  Those who taste the ambrosial fruit remain satisfied with Truth.<br>
  They have no doubt or sense of separation - their tongues taste the divine taste. ||7||<br>
  By His Command, and through your past actions, you came into the world; walk forever according to His Will.<br>
  Please, grant virtue to Nanak, the virtueless one; bless him with the glorious greatness of the Truth. ||8||20||<br>

  True is Your Service; bless me with it, O Merciful Lord.<br>
  I live by praising You; You are my Anchor and Support. ||2||<br>
  I am Your servant, the gate-keeper at Your Gate; You alone know my pain.<br>
  How wonderful is Your devotional worship! It removes all pains. ||3||<br>
  The Gurmukhs know that by chanting the Naam, they shall dwell in His Court, in His Presence.<br>
  True and acceptable is that time, when one recognizes the Word of the Shabad. ||4||<br>
  Those who practice Truth, contentment and love, obtain the supplies of the Lord's Name.<br>
  So banish corruption from your mind, and the True One will grant you Truth. ||5||<br>
  The True Lord inspires true love in the truthful.<br>
  He Himself administers justice, as it pleases His Will. ||6||<br>
  True is the gift of the True, Compassionate Lord.<br>
  Day and night, I serve the One whose Name is priceless. ||7||<br>
  You are so sublime, and I am so lowly, but I am called Your slave.<br>
  Please, shower Nanak with Your Glance of Grace, that he, the separated one, may merge with You again, O Lord. ||8||21||<br>
  Aasaa, First Mehl:<br>
  How can coming and going, the cycle of reincarnation be ended? And how can one meet the Lord?<br>
  The pain of birth and death is so great, in constant skepticism and duality. ||1||<br>
  Without the Name, what is life? Cleverness is detestable and cursed.<br>
  One who does not serve the Holy True Guru, is not pleased by devotion to the Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Coming and going is ended only when one finds the True Guru.<br>
  He gives the wealth and capital of the Lord's Name, and false doubt is destroyed. ||2||<br>
  Joining the humble Saintly beings, let us sing the blessed, blessed Praises of the Lord.<br>
  The Primal Lord, the Infinite, is obtained by the Gurmukh. ||3||<br>
  The drama of the world is staged like the show of a buffoon.<br>
  For an instant, for a moment, the show is seen, but it disappears in no time at all. ||4||<br>
  The game of chance is played on the board of egotism, with the pieces of falsehood and ego.<br>
  The whole world loses; he alone wins, who reflects upon the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||5||<br>
  As is the cane in the hand of the blind man, so is the Lord's Name for me.<br>
  The Lord's Name is my Support, night and day and morning. ||6||<br>
  As You keep me, Lord, I live; the Lord's Name is my only Support.<br>
  It is my only comfort in the end; the gate of salvation is found by His humble servants. ||7||<br>
  The pain of birth and death is removed, by chanting and meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<br>

  If You show Your Mercy, then one obtains the supreme status, and speaks the Unspoken Speech. ||3||<br>
  You are the Creator; all are created by You. What can any mortal being do?<br>
  He alone, upon whom You shower Your Grace, is absorbed into the Truth. ||4||<br>
  Everyone who comes and goes chants Your Name.<br>
  When it is pleasing to Your Will, then the Gurmukh understands. Otherwise, the self-willed manmukhs wander in ignorance. ||5||<br>
  You gave the four Vedas to Brahma, for him to read and read continually, and reflect upon.<br>
  The wretched one does not understand His Command, and is reincarnated into heaven and hell. ||6||<br>
  In each and every age, He creates the kings, who are sung of as His Incarnations.<br>
  Even they have not found His limits; what can I speak of and contemplate? ||7||<br>
  You are True, and all that You do is True. If You bless me with the Truth, I will speak on it.<br>

  The great glory of meeting the True Guru is<br>
  that it has quenched the fire of possessiveness and desire;<br>
  imbued with peace and poise, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||2||<br>
  Without the Perfect Guru, no one knows the Lord.<br>
  Attached to Maya, they are engrossed in duality.<br>
  The Gurmukh receives the Naam, and the Bani of the Lord's Word. ||3||<br>
  Service to the Guru is the most excellent and sublime penance of penances.<br>
  The Dear Lord dwells in the mind, and all suffering departs.<br>
  Then, at the Gate of the True Lord, one appears truthful. ||4||<br>
  Serving the Guru, one comes to know the three worlds.<br>

  Offer your head, and shed your self-conceit.<br>
  One who understands the Lord's Command finds lasting peace. ||3||<br>
  He Himself does, and causes others to do.<br>
  He Himself enshrines His Name in the mind of the Gurmukh.<br>
  He Himself misleads us, and He Himself puts us back on the Path.<br>
  Through the True Word of the Shabad, we merge into the True Lord. ||4||<br>
  True is the Shabad, and True is the Word of the Lord's Bani.<br>
  In each and every age, the Gurmukhs speak it and chant it.<br>
  The self-willed manmukhs are deluded by doubt and attachment.<br>
  Without the Name, everyone wanders around insane. ||5||<br>
  Throughout the three worlds, is the one Maya.<br>
  The fool reads and reads, but holds tight to duality.<br>
  He performs all sorts of rituals, but still suffers terrible pain.<br>
  Serving the True Guru, eternal peace is obtained. ||6||<br>
  Reflective meditation upon the Shabad is such sweet nectar.<br>
  Night and day, one enjoys it, subduing his ego.<br>
  When the Lord showers His Mercy, we enjoy celestial bliss.<br>
  Imbued with the Naam, love the True Lord forever. ||7||<br>
  Meditate on the Lord, and read and reflect upon the Guru's Shabad.<br>
  Subdue your ego and meditate on the Lord.<br>
  Meditate on the Lord, and be imbued with fear and love of the True One.<br>
  O Nanak, enshrine the Naam within your heart, through the Guru's Teachings. ||8||3||25||<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Raag Aasaa, Third Mehl, Ashtapadees, Eighth House, Kaafee:<br>
  Peace emanates from the Guru; He puts out the fire of desire.<br>
  The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is obtained from the Guru; it is the greatest greatness. ||1||<br>
  Keep the One Name in your consciousness, O my Siblings of Destiny.<br>
  Seeing the world on fire, I have hurried to the Lord's Sanctuary. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Spiritual wisdom emanates from the Guru; reflect upon the supreme essence of reality.<br>
  Through the Guru, the Lord's Mansion and His Court are attained; His devotional worship is overflowing with treasures. ||2||<br>
  The Gurmukh meditates on the Naam; he achieves reflective meditation and understanding.<br>
  The Gurmukh is the Lord's devotee, immersed in His Praises; the Infinite Word of the Shabad dwells within him. ||3||<br>
  Happiness emanates from the Gurmukh; he never suffers pain.<br>
  The Gurmukh conquers his ego, and his mind is immaculately pure. ||4||<br>
  Meeting the True Guru, self-conceit is removed, and understanding of the three worlds is obtained.<br>
  The Immaculate Divine Light is pervading and permeating everywhere; one's light merges into the Light. ||5||<br>
  The Perfect Guru instructs, and one's intellect becomes sublime.<br>
  A cooling and soothing peace comes within, and through the Naam, peace is obtained. ||6||<br>
  One meets the Perfect True Guru only when the Lord bestows His Glance of Grace.<br>
  All sins and vices are eradicated, and one shall never again suffer pain or distress. ||7||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 079</h2></center>
  Glory is in His Hands; He bestows His Name, and attaches us to it.<br>
  O Nanak, the treasure of the Naam abides within the mind, and glory is obtained. ||8||4||26||<br>
  Aasaa, Third Mehl:<br>
  Listen, O mortal: enshrine His Name within your mind; He shall come to meet with you, O my Sibling of Destiny.<br>
  Night and day, center your consciousness on true devotional worship of the True Lord. ||1||<br>
  Meditate on the One Naam, and you shall find peace, O my Siblings of Destiny.<br>
  Eradicate egotism and duality, and your glory shall be glorious. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The angels, humans and silent sages long for this devotional worship, but without the True Guru, it cannot be attained.<br>
  The Pandits, the religious scholars, and the astrologers read their books, but they do not understand. ||2||<br>
  He Himself keeps all in His Hand; nothing else can be said.<br>
  Whatever He gives, is received. The Guru has imparted this understanding to me. ||3||<br>
  All beings and creatures are His; He belongs to all.<br>
  So who can we call bad, since there is no other? ||4||<br>
  The Command of the One Lord is pervading throughout; duty to the One Lord is upon the heads of all.<br>
  He Himself has led them astray, and placed greed and corruption within their hearts. ||5||<br>
  He has sanctified those few Gurmukhs who understand Him, and reflect upon Him.<br>
  He grants devotional worship to them, and within them is the treasure. ||6||<br>
  The spiritual teachers know nothing but the Truth; they obtain true understanding.<br>
  They are led astray by Him, but they do not go astray, because they know the True Lord. ||7||<br>
  Within the homes of their bodies, the five passions are pervading, but here, the five are well-behaved.<br>
  O Nanak, without the True Guru, they are not overcome; through the Naam, the ego is conquered. ||8||5||27||<br>
  Aasaa, Third Mehl:<br>
  Everything is within the home of your own self; there is nothing beyond it.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, it is obtained, and the doors of the inner heart are opened wide. ||1||<br>
  From the True Guru, the Lord's Name is obtained, O Siblings of Destiny.<br>
  The treasure of the Naam is within; the Perfect True Guru has shown this to me. ||1||Pause||<br>
  One who is a buyer of the Lord's Name, finds it, and obtains the jewel of contemplation.<br>
  He opens the doors deep within, and through the Eyes of Divine Vision, beholds the treasure of liberation. ||2||<br>
  There are so many mansions within the body; the soul dwells within them.<br>
  He obtains the fruits of his mind's desires, and he shall not have to go through reincarnation again. ||3||<br>
  The appraisers cherish the commodity of the Name; they obtain understanding from the Guru.<br>
  The wealth of the Naam is priceless; how few are the Gurmukhs who obtain it. ||4||<br>
  Searching outwardly, what can anyone find? The commodity is deep within the home of the self, O Siblings of Destiny.<br>
  The entire world is wandering around, deluded by doubt; the self-willed manmukhs lose their honor. ||5||<br>
  The false one leaves his own hearth and home, and goes out to another's home.<br>
  Like a thief, he is caught, and without the Naam, he is beaten and struck down. ||6||<br>
  Those who know their own home, are happy, O Siblings of Destiny.<br>
  They realize God within their own hearts, through the glorious greatness of the Guru. ||7||<br>
  He Himself gives gifts, and He Himself bestows understanding; unto whom can we complain?<br>
  O Nanak, meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and you shall obtain glory in the True Court. ||8||6||28||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 080</h2></center>
  Aasaa, Third Mehl:<br>
  Those who recognize their own selves, enjoy the sweet flavor, O Siblings of Destiny.<br>
  Those who drink in the sublime essence of the Lord are emancipated; they love the Truth. ||1||<br>
  The Beloved Lord is the purest of the pure; He comes to dwell in the pure mind.<br>
  Praising the Lord, through the Guru's Teachings, one remains unaffected by corruption. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Without the Word of the Shabad, they do not understand themselves -they are totally blind, O Siblings of Destiny.<br>
  Through the Guru's Teachings, the heart is illuminated, and in the end, only the Naam shall be your companion. ||2||<br>
  They are occupied with the Naam, and only the Naam; they deal only in the Naam.<br>
  Deep within their hearts is the Naam; upon their lips is the Naam; they contemplate the Word of God, and the Naam. ||3||<br>
  They listen to the Naam, believe in the Naam, and through the Naam, they obtain glory.<br>
  They praise the Naam, forever and ever, and through the Naam, they obtain the Mansion of the Lord's Presence. ||4||<br>
  Through the Naam, their hearts are illumined, and through the Naam, they obtain honor.<br>
  Through the Naam, peace wells up; I seek the Sanctuary of the Naam. ||5||<br>
  Without the Naam, no one is accepted; the self-willed manmukhs lose their honor.<br>
  In the City of Death, they are tied down and beaten, and they lose their lives in vain. ||6||<br>
  Those Gurmukhs who realize the Naam, all serve the Naam.<br>
  So believe in the Naam, and only the Naam; through the Naam, glorious greatness is obtained. ||7||<br>
  He alone receives it, unto whom it is given. Through the Guru's Teachings, the Naam is realized.<br>
  O Nanak, everything is under the influence of the Naam; by perfect good destiny, a few obtain it. ||8||7||29||<br>
  Aasaa, Third Mehl:<br>
  The deserted brides do not obtain the Mansion of their Husband's Presence, nor do they know His taste.<br>
  They speak harsh words, and do not bow to Him; they are in love with another. ||1||<br>
  How can this mind come under control?<br>
  By Guru's Grace, it is held in check; instructed in spiritual wisdom, it returns to its home. ||1||Pause||<br>
  He Himself adorns the happy soul-brides; they bear Him love and affection.<br>
  They live in harmony with the Sweet Will of the True Guru, naturally adorned with the Naam. ||2||<br>
  They enjoy their Beloved forever, and their bed is decorated with Truth.<br>
  They are fascinated with the Love of their Husband Lord; meeting their Beloved, they obtain peace. ||3||<br>
  Spiritual wisdom is the incomparable decoration of the happy soul-bride.<br>
  She is so beautiful - she is the queen of all; she enjoys the love and affection of her Husband Lord. ||4||<br>
  The True Lord, the Unseen, the Infinite, has infused His Love among the happy soul-brides.<br>
  They serve their True Guru, with true love and affection. ||5||<br>
  The happy soul-bride has adorned herself with the necklace of virtue.<br>
  She applies the perfume of love to her body, and within her mind is the jewel of reflective meditation. ||6||<br>
  Those who are imbued with devotional worship are the most exalted. Their social standing and honor come from the Word of the Shabad.<br>
  Without the Naam, all are low class, like maggots in manure. ||7||<br>
  Everyone proclaims, "Me, me!"; but without the Shabad, the ego does not depart.<br>
  O Nanak, those who are imbued with the Naam lose their ego; they remain absorbed in the True Lord. ||8||8||30||<br>
  Aasaa, Third Mehl:<br>
  Those who are imbued with the True Lord are spotless and pure; their reputation is forever true.<br>
  Here, they are known in each and every home, and hereafter, they are famous throughout the ages. ||1||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 081</h2></center>
  O beauteous and joyful mind, imbue yourself with your true color.<br>
  If you imbue yourself with the Beauteous Word of the Guru's Bani, then this color shall never fade away. ||1||Pause||<br>
  I am lowly, filthy, and totally egotistical; I am attached to the corruption of duality.<br>
  But meeting with the Guru, the Philosopher's Stone, I am transformed into gold; I am blended with the Pure Light of the Infinite Lord. ||2||<br>
  Without the Guru, no one is imbued with the color of the Lord's Love; meeting with the Guru, this color is applied.<br>
  Those who are imbued with the Fear, and the Love of the Guru, are absorbed in the Praise of the True Lord. ||3||<br>
  Without fear, the cloth is not dyed, and the mind is not rendered pure.<br>
  Without fear, the performance of rituals is false, and one finds no place of rest. ||4||<br>
  Only those whom the Lord imbues, are so imbued; they join the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation.<br>
  From the Perfect Guru, the Sat Sangat emanates, and one easily merges into the Love of the True One. ||5||<br>
  Without the Sangat, the Company of the Holy, all remain like beasts and animals.<br>
  They do not know the One who created them; without the Name, all are thieves. ||6||<br>
  Some purchase merits and sell off their demerits; through the Guru, they obtain peace and poise.<br>
  Serving the Guru, they obtain the Name, which comes to dwell deep within. ||7||<br>
  The One Lord is the Giver of all; He assigns tasks to each and every person.<br>
  O Nanak, the Lord embellishes us with the Name; attached to the Word of the Shabad, we are merged into Him. ||8||9||31||<br>
  Aasaa, Third Mehl:<br>
  Everyone longs for the Name, but he alone receives it, unto whom the Lord shows His Mercy.<br>
  Without the Name, there is only pain; he alone obtains peace, whose mind is filled with the Name. ||1||<br>
  You are infinite and merciful; I seek Your Sanctuary.<br>
  From the Perfect Guru, the glorious greatness of the Naam is obtained. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Inwardly and outwardly, there is only the One Lord. He has created the world, with its many varieties.<br>
  According to the Order of His Will, He makes us act. What else can we talk about, O Siblings of Destiny? ||2||<br>
  Knowledge and ignorance are all your making; You have control over these.<br>
  Some, You forgive, and unite with Yourself; while others, the wicked, you strike down and drive out of Your Court. ||3||<br>
  Some, from the very beginning, are pure and pious; You attach them to Your Name.<br>
  Serving the Guru, peace wells up; through the True Word of the Shabad, one comes to understand. ||4||<br>
  Some are crooked, filthy and vicious; the Lord Himself has led them astray from the Name.<br>
  They have no intuition, no understanding and no self-discipline; they wander around delirious. ||5||<br>
  He grants faith to those whom He has blessed with His Glance of Grace.<br>
  This mind finds truth, contentment and self-discipline, hearing the Immaculate Word of the Shabad. ||6||<br>
  By reading books, one cannot reach Him; by speaking and talking, His limits cannot be found.<br>
  Through the Guru, His value is found; through the True Word of the Shabad, understanding is obtained. ||7||<br>
  So reform this mind and body, by contemplating the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<br>
  O Nanak, within this body is the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord; it is found through the Love of the Infinite Guru. ||8||10||32||<br>

  They find their Husband Lord within their own home, contemplating the True Word of the Shabad. ||1||<br>
  Through merits, their demerits are forgiven, and they embrace love for the Lord.<br>
  The soul-bride then obtains the Lord as her Husband; meeting the Guru, this union comes about. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Some do not know the Presence of their Husband Lord; they are deluded by duality and doubt.<br>
  How can the forsaken brides meet Him? Their life night passes in pain. ||2||<br>
  Those whose minds are filled with the True Lord, perform truthful actions.<br>
  Night and day, they serve the Lord with poise, and are absorbed in the True Lord. ||3||<br>
  The forsaken brides wander around, deluded by doubt; telling lies, they eat poison.<br>
  They do not know their Husband Lord, and upon their deserted bed, they suffer in misery. ||4||<br>
  The True Lord is the One and only; do not be deluded by doubt, O my mind.<br>
  Consult with the Guru, serve the True Lord, and enshrine the Immaculate Truth within your mind. ||5||<br>
  The happy soul-bride always finds her Husband Lord; she banishes egotism and self-conceit.<br>
  She remains attached to her Husband Lord, night and day, and she finds peace upon His Bed of Truth. ||6||<br>
  Those who shouted, "Mine, mine!" have departed, without obtaining anything.<br>
  The separated one does not obtain the Mansion of the Lord's Presence, and departs, repenting in the end. ||7||<br>
  That Husband Lord of mine is the One and only; I am in love with the One alone.<br>
  O Nanak, if the soul-bride longs for peace, she should enshrine the Lord's Name within her mind. ||8||11||33||<br>
  Aasaa, Third Mehl:<br>
  Those whom the Lord has caused to drink in the Ambrosial Nectar, naturally, intuitively, enjoy the sublime essence.<br>
  The True Lord is care-free; he does not have even an iota of greed. ||1||<br>
  The True Ambrosial Nectar rains down, and trickles into the mouths of the Gurmukhs.<br>
  Their minds are forever rejuvenated, and they naturally, intuitively, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The self-willed manmukhs are forever forsaken brides; they cry out and bewail at the Lord's Gate.<br>
  Those who do not enjoy the sublime taste of their Husband Lord, act according to their pre-ordained destiny. ||2||<br>
  The Gurmukh plants the seed of the True Name, and it sprouts. He deals in the True Name alone.<br>
  Those whom the Lord has attached to this profitable venture, are granted the treasure of devotional worship. ||3||<br>
  The Gurmukh is forever the true, happy soul-bride; she adorns herself with the fear of God and devotion to Him.<br>
  Night and day, she enjoys her Husband Lord; she keeps Truth enshrined within her heart. ||4||<br>
  I am a sacrifice to those who have enjoyed their Husband Lord.<br>
  They dwell forever with their Husband Lord; they eradicate self-conceit from within. ||5||<br>
  Their bodies and minds are cooled and soothed, and their faces are radiant, from the love and affection of their Husband Lord.<br>
  They enjoy their Husband Lord upon His cozy bed, having conquered their ego and desire. ||6||<br>
  Granting His Grace, He comes into our homes, through our infinite Love for the Guru.<br>
  The happy soul-bride obtains the One Lord as her Husband. ||7||<br>

  O my mind, do not think of the Lord as being far away; behold Him ever close at hand.<br>
  He is always listening, and always watching over us; the Word of His Shabad is all-pervading everywhere. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The Gurmukhs understand their own selves; they meditate single-mindedly on the Lord.<br>
  They enjoy their Husband Lord continually; through the True Name, they find peace. ||2||<br>
  O my mind, no one belongs to you; contemplate the Shabad, and see this.<br>
  So run to the Lord's Sanctuary, and find the gate of salvation. ||3||<br>
  Listen to the Shabad, and understand the Shabad, and lovingly focus your consciousness on the True One.<br>
  Through the Shabad, conquer your ego, and in the True Mansion of the Lord's Presence, you shall find peace. ||4||<br>
  In this age, the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is glory; without the Name, there is no glory.<br>
  The glory of this Maya lasts for only a few days; it disappears in an instant. ||5||<br>
  Those who forget the Naam are already dead, and they continue dying.<br>
  They do not enjoy the sublime essence of the Lord's taste; they sink into the manure. ||6||<br>
  Some are forgiven by the Lord; He unites them with Himself, and keeps them attached to the Naam, night and day.<br>
  They practice Truth, and abide in Truth; being truthful, they merge into Truth. ||7||<br>
  Without the Shabad, the world does not hear, and does not see; deaf and blind, it wanders around.<br>
  Without the Naam, it obtains only misery; the Naam is received only by His Will. ||8||<br>
  Those persons who link their consciousness with the Word of His Bani, are immaculately pure, and approved by the Lord.<br>
  O Nanak, they never forget the Naam, and in the Court of the Lord, they are known as true. ||9||13||35||<br>
  Aasaa, Third Mehl:<br>
  Through the Word of the Shabad, the devotees are known; their words are true.<br>

  Through the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, His humble servants obtain honor.<br>
  How blessed is their coming into the world! Everyone adores them. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Ego, self-centeredness, excessive anger and pride are the lot of mankind.<br>
  If one dies in the Word of the Shabad, then he is rid of this, and his light is merged into the Light of the Lord God. ||2||<br>
  Meeting with the Perfect True Guru, my life has been blessed.<br>
  I have obtained the nine treasures of the Naam, and my storehouse is inexhaustible, filled to overflowing. ||3||<br>
  Those who love the Naam come as dealers in the merchandise of the Naam.<br>
  Those who become Gurmukh obtain this wealth; deep within, they contemplate the Shabad. ||4||<br>
  The egotistical, self-willed manmukhs do not appreciate the value of devotional worship.<br>
  The Primal Lord Himself has beguiled them; they lose their lives in the gamble. ||5||<br>
  Without loving affection, devotional worship is not possible, and the body cannot be at peace.<br>
  The wealth of love is obtained from the Guru; through devotion, the mind becomes steady. ||6||<br>
  He alone performs devotional worship, whom the Lord so blesses; he contemplates the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<br>
  The One Name abides in his heart, and he conquers his ego and duality. ||7||<br>
  The One Name is the social status and honor of the devotees; the Lord Himself adorns them.<br>

  In this age, the Gurmukhs are pure; they remain absorbed in the love of the True Name.<br>
  Without the destiny of good karma, nothing can be obtained; what can we say or do? ||2||<br>
  He understands his own self, and dies in the Word of the Shabad; he banishes corruption from his mind.<br>
  He hurries to the Guru's Sanctuary, and is forgiven by the Forgiving Lord. ||3||<br>
  Without the Name, peace is not obtained, and pain does not depart from within.<br>
  This world is engrossed in attachment to Maya; it has gone astray in duality and doubt. ||4||<br>
  The forsaken soul-brides do not know the value of their Husband Lord; how can they decorate themselves?<br>
  Night and day, they continually burn, and they do not enjoy the Bed of their Husband Lord. ||5||<br>
  The happy soul-brides obtain the Mansion of His Presence, eradicating their self-conceit from within.<br>
  They decorate themselves with the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and their Husband Lord unites them with Himself. ||6||<br>
  He has forgotten death, in the darkness of attachment to Maya.<br>
  The self-willed manmukhs die again and again, and are reborn; they die again, and are miserable at the Gate of Death. ||7||<br>

  That happiness which one receives by beholding Your Darshan, O Beloved, cannot be described in words. ||5||<br>
  True Love cannot be broken, O Beloved; throughout the ages, it remains. ||6||<br>

  You know all about my condition, O Beloved; who can I speak to about it? ||1||<br>
  You are the Giver of all beings; they eat and wear what You give them. ||2||<br>
  Pleasure and pain come by Your Will, O Beloved; they do not come from any other. ||3||<br>
  Whatever You cause me to do, that I do, O Beloved; I cannot do anything else. ||4||<br>
  All my days and nights are blessed, O Beloved, when I chant and meditate on the Lord's Name. ||5||<br>
  He does the deeds, O Beloved, which are pre-ordained, and inscribed upon his forehead. ||6||<br>
  The One is Himself prevailing everywhere, O Beloved; He is pervading in each and every heart. ||7||<br>
  Lift me up out of the deep pit of the world, O Beloved; Nanak has taken to Your Sanctuary. ||8||3||22||15||2||42||<br>

  Those whose consciousness remains committed to His Service - blessed is their birth and their coming into the world. ||1||<br>
  O mind, why forget Him? You foolish mind!<br>
  When your account is adjusted, O brother, only then shall you be judged wise. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Eevree: The Primal Lord is the Giver; He alone is True.<br>
  No accounting is due from the Gurmukh who understands the Lord through these letters. ||2||<br>
  Ooraa: Sing the Praises of the One whose limit cannot be found.<br>
  Those who perform service and practice truth, obtain the fruits of their rewards. ||3||<br>
  Nganga: One who understands spiritual wisdom becomes a Pandit, a religious scholar.<br>
  One who recognizes the One Lord among all beings does not talk of ego. ||4||<br>
  Kakka: When the hair grows grey, then it shines without shampoo.<br>
  The hunters of the King of Death come, and bind him in the chains of Maya. ||5||<br>
  Khakha: The Creator is the King of the world; He enslaves by giving nourishment.<br>
  By His Binding, all the world is bound; no other Command prevails. ||6||<br>
  Gagga: One who renounces the singing of the songs of the Lord of the Universe, becomes arrogant in his speech.<br>
  One who has shaped the pots, and made the world the kiln, decides when to put them in it. ||7||<br>
  Ghagha: The servant who performs service, remains attached to the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<br>
  One who recognizes bad and good as one and the same - in this way he is absorbed into the Lord and Master. ||8||<br>
  Chacha: He created the four Vedas, the four sources of creation, and the four ages<br>
  - through each and every age, He Himself has been the Yogi, the enjoyer, the Pandit and the scholar. ||9||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 087</h2></center>
  Chhachha: Ignorance exists within everyone; doubt is Your doing, O Lord.<br>
  Having created doubt, You Yourself cause them to wander in delusion; those whom You bless with Your Mercy meet with the Guru. ||10||<br>
  Jajja: That humble being who begs for wisdom has wandered begging through 8.4 million incarnations.<br>
  The One Lord takes away, and the One Lord gives; I have not heard of any other. ||11||<br>
  Jhajha: O mortal being, why are you dying of anxiety? Whatever the Lord is to give, He shall keep on giving.<br>
  He gives, and gives, and watches over us; according to the Orders which He issues, His beings receive nourishment. ||12||<br>
  Nyanya: When the Lord bestows His Glance of Grace, then I do not behold any other.<br>
  The One Lord is totally pervading everywhere; the One Lord abides within the mind. ||13||<br>
  Tatta: Why do you practice hypocrisy, O mortal? In a moment, in an instant, you shall have to get up and depart.<br>
  Don't lose your life in the gamble - hurry to the Lord's Sanctuary. ||14||<br>
  T'hat'ha: Peace pervades within those who link their consciousness to the Lord's Lotus Feet.<br>
  Those humble beings, whose consciousness is so linked, are saved; by Your Grace, they obtain peace. ||15||<br>
  Dadda: Why do you make such ostentatious shows, O mortal? Whatever exists, shall all pass away.<br>
  So serve Him, who is contained and pervading among everyone, and you shall obtain peace. ||16||<br>
  Dhadha: He Himself establishes and disestablishes; as it pleases His Will, so does He act.<br>
  Having created the creation, He watches over it; He issues His Commands, and emancipates those, upon whom He casts His Glance of Grace. ||17||<br>
  Nanna: One whose heart is filled with the Lord, sings His Glorious Praises.<br>
  One whom the Creator Lord unites with Himself, is not consigned to reincarnation. ||18||<br>
  Tatta: The terrible world-ocean is so very deep; its limits cannot be found.<br>
  I do not have a boat, or even a raft; I am drowning - save me, O Savior King! ||19||<br>
  T'hat'ha: In all places and interspaces, He is; everything which exists, is by His doing.<br>
  What is doubt? What is called Maya? Whatever pleases Him is good. ||20||<br>
  Dadda: Do not blame anyone else; blame instead your own actions.<br>
  Whatever I did, for that I have suffered; I do not blame anyone else. ||21||<br>
  Dhadha: His power established and upholds the earth; the Lord has imparted His color to everything.<br>
  His gifts are received by everyone; all act according to His Command. ||22||<br>
  Nanna: The Husband Lord enjoys eternal pleasures, but He is not seen or understood.<br>
  I am called the happy soul-bride, O sister, but my Husband Lord has never met me. ||23||<br>
  Pappa: The Supreme King, the Transcendent Lord, created the world, and watches over it.<br>
  He sees and understands, and knows everything; inwardly and outwardly, he is fully pervading. ||24||<br>
  Faffa: The whole world is caught in the noose of Death, and all are bound by its chains.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, they alone are saved, who hurry to enter the Lord's Sanctuary. ||25||<br>
  Babba: He set out to play the game, on the chess-board of the four ages.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 088</h2></center>
  He made all beings and creatures his chessmen, and He Himself threw the dice. ||26||<br>
  Bhabha: Those who search, find the fruits of their rewards; by Guru's Grace, they live in the Fear of God.<br>
  The self-willed manmukhs wander around, and they do not remember the Lord; the fools are consigned to the cycle of 8.4 million incarnations. ||27||<br>
  Mamma: In emotional attachment, he dies; he only thinks of the Lord, the Love of Nectar, when he dies.<br>
  As long as the body is alive, he reads other things, and forgets the letter 'm', which stands for marnaa - death. ||28||<br>
  Yaya: He is never reincarnated again, if he recognizes the True Lord.<br>
  The Gurmukh speaks, the Gurmukh understands, and the Gurmukh knows only the One Lord. ||29||<br>
  Rarra: The Lord is contained among all; He created all beings.<br>
  Having created His beings, He has put them all to work; they alone remember the Naam, upon whom He bestows His Grace. ||30||<br>
  Lalla: He has assigned people to their tasks, and made the love of Maya seem sweet to them.<br>
  We eat and drink; we should endure equally whatever occurs, by His Will, by His Command. ||31||<br>
  Wawa: The all-pervading Transcendent Lord beholds the world; He created the form it wears.<br>
  He beholds, tastes, and knows everything; He is pervading and permeating inwardly and outwardly. ||32||<br>
  Rarra: Why do you quarrel, O mortal? Meditate on the Imperishable Lord, and be absorbed into the True One. Become a sacrifice to Him. ||33||<br>
  Haha: There is no other Giver than Him; having created the creatures, He gives them nourishment.<br>
  Meditate on the Lord's Name, be absorbed into the Lord's Name, and night and day, reap the Profit of the Lord's Name. ||34||<br>
  Airaa: He Himself created the world; whatever He has to do, He continues to do.<br>
  He acts, and causes others to act, and He knows everything; so says Nanak, the poet. ||35||1||<br>
  Raag Aasaa, Third Mehl, Patee - The Alphabet:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Ayo, Angai: The whole world which was created - Kaahkai, Ghangai: It shall pass away.<br>
  Reeree, Laalee: People commit sins, and falling into vice, forget virtue. ||1||<br>
  O mortal, why have you studied such an account,<br>
  which shall call you to answer for payment? ||1||Pause||<br>
  Sidhan, Ngaayiyai: You do not remember the Lord. Nanna: You do not take the Lord's Name.<br>
  Chhachha: You are wearing away, every night and day; you fool, how will you find release? You are held in the grip of death. ||2||<br>
  Babba: You do not understand, you fool; deluded by doubt, you are wasting your life.<br>
  Without justification, you call yourself a teacher; thus you take on the loads of others. ||3||<br>
  Jajja: You have been robbed of your Light, you fool; in the end, you shall have to depart, and you shall regret and repent.<br>
  You have not remembered the One Word of the Shabad, and so you shall have to enter the womb over and over again. ||4||<br>
  Read that which is written on your forehead, O Pandit, and do not teach wickedness to others.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 089</h2></center>
  First, the teacher is tied down, and then, the noose is placed around the pupil's neck. ||5||<br>
  Sassa: You have lost your self-discipline, you fool, and you have accepted an offering under false pretenses.<br>
  The daughter of the alms-giver is just like your own; by accepting this payment for performing the wedding ceremony, you have cursed your own life. ||6||<br>
  Mamma: You have been cheated out your intellect, you fool, and you are afflicted with the great disease of ego.<br>
  Within your innermost self, you do not recognize God, and you compromise yourself for the sake of Maya. ||7||<br>
  Kakka: You wander around in sexual desire and anger, you fool; attached to possessiveness, you have forgotten the Lord.<br>
  You read, and reflect, and proclaim out loud, but without understanding, you are drowned to death. ||8||<br>
  Tatta: In anger, you are burnt, you fool. T'hat'ha: That place where you live, is cursed.<br>
  Ghagha: You go begging from door to door, you fool. Dadda: But still, you do not receive the gift. ||9||<br>
  Pappa: You shall not be able to swim across, you fool, since you are engrossed in worldly affairs.<br>
  The True Lord Himself has ruined you, you fool; this is the destiny written on your forehead. ||10||<br>
  Bhabha: You have drowned in the terrifying world-ocean, you fool, and you have become engrossed in Maya.<br>
  One who comes to know the One Lord, by Guru's Grace, is carried across in an instant. ||11||<br>
  Wawa: Your turn has come, you fool, but you have forgotten the Lord of Light.<br>
  This opportunity shall not come again, you fool; you shall fall under the power of the Messenger of Death. ||12||<br>
  Jhajha: You shall never have to regret and repent, you fool, if you listen to the Teachings of the True Guru, for even an instant.<br>
  Without the True Guru, there is no Guru at all; one who is without a Guru has a bad reputation. ||13||<br>
  Dhadha: Restrain your wandering mind, you fool; deep within you the treasure is to be found.<br>
  When one becomes Gurmukh, then he drinks in the sublime essence of the Lord; throughout the ages, he continues to drink it in. ||14||<br>
  Gagga: Keep the Lord of the Universe in your mind, you fool; by mere words, no one has ever attained Him.<br>
  Enshrine the Guru's feet within your heart, you fool, and all your past sins shall be forgiven. ||15||<br>
  Haha: Understand the Lord's Sermon, you fool; only then shall you attain eternal peace.<br>
  The more the self-willed manmukhs read, the more pain they suffer. Without the True Guru, liberation is not obtained. ||16||<br>
  Rarra: Center your consciousness on the Lord, you fool; abide with those whose hearts are filled with the Lord.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, those who recognize the Lord, understand the absolute Lord. ||17||<br>
  Your limits cannot be known; the indescribable Lord cannot be described.<br>

  When the bride enshrines great love for her Husband Lord, He becomes merciful, and loves her in return.<br>

  The soul-bride meets her Husband Lord, when the Lord Master Himself showers His favor upon her.<br>
  Her bed is decorated in the company of her Beloved, and her seven pools are filled with ambrosial nectar.<br>
  Be kind and compassionate to me, O Merciful True Lord, that I may obtain the Word of the Shabad, and sing Your Glorious Praises.<br>
  O Nanak, gazing upon her Husband Lord, the soul-bride is delighted, and her mind is filled with joy. ||1||<br>
  O bride of natural beauty, offer your loving prayers to the Lord.<br>
  The Lord is pleasing to my mind and body; I am intoxicated in my Lord God's Company.<br>
  Imbued with the Love of God, I pray to the Lord, and through the Lord's Name, I abide in peace.<br>
  If you recognize His Glorious Virtues, then you shall come to know God; thus virtue shall dwell in you, and sin shall run away.<br>
  Without You, I cannot survive, even for an instant; by merely talking and listening about You, I am not satisfied.<br>
  Nanak proclaims, "O Beloved, O Beloved!" His tongue and mind are drenched with the Lord's sublime essence. ||2||<br>
  O my companions and friends, my Husband Lord is the merchant.<br>
  I have purchased the Lord's Name; its sweetness and value are unlimited.<br>
  His value is invaluable; the Beloved dwells in His true home. If it is pleasing to God, then He blesses His bride.<br>
  Some enjoy sweet pleasures with the Lord, while I stand crying at His door.<br>
  The Creator, the Cause of causes, the All-powerful Lord Himself arranges our affairs.<br>
  O Nanak, blessed is the soul-bride, upon whom He casts His Glance of Grace; she enshrines the Word of the Shabad in her heart. ||3||<br>

  He enjoys me, and imbued with His Love, I have captivated His heart, and given mine to Him.<br>
  I gave my mind, and obtained the Lord as my Husband; as it pleases His Will, He enjoys me.<br>
  I have placed my body and mind before my Husband Lord, and through the Shabad, I have been blessed. Within the home of my own self, I have obtained the ambrosial fruit.<br>
  He is not obtained by intellectual recitation or great cleverness; only by love does the mind obtain Him.<br>
  O Nanak, the Lord Master is my Best Friend; I am not an ordinary person. ||4||1||<br>

  O Nanak, the detached ones are imbued with His Name, the unstruck melody, and the celestial vibrations. ||1||<br>
  Tell me, how can I reach that unreachable, that unreachable city?<br>
  By practicing truthfulness and self-restraint, by contemplating His Glorious Virtues, and living the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<br>
  Practicing the True Word of the Shabad, one comes to the home of his own inner being, and obtains the treasure of virtue.<br>
  He has no stems, roots, leaves or branches, but He is the Supreme Lord over the heads of all.<br>
  Practicing intensive meditation, chanting and self-discipline, people have grown weary; stubbornly practicing these rituals, they still have not found Him.<br>
  O Nanak, through spiritual wisdom, the Lord, the Life of the world, is met; the True Guru imparts this understanding. ||2||<br>
  The Guru is the ocean, the mountain of jewels, overflowing with jewels.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 091</h2></center>
  Take your bath in the seven seas, O my mind, and become pure.<br>
  One bathes in the water of purity when it is pleasing to God, and obtains the five virtues by reflective meditation.<br>
  Renouncing sexual desire, anger, deceit and corruption, he enshrines the True Name in his heart.<br>
  When the waves of ego, greed and avarice subside, he finds the Lord Master, Merciful to the meek.<br>
  O Nanak, there is no place of pilgrimage comparable to the Guru; the True Guru is the Lord of the world. ||3||<br>
  I have searched the jungles and forests, and looked upon all the fields.<br>
  You created the three worlds, the entire universe, everything.<br>
  You created everything; You alone are permanent. Nothing is equal to You.<br>
  You are the Giver - all are Your beggars; without You, who should we praise?<br>
  You bestow Your gifts, even when we do not ask for them, O Great Giver; devotion to You is a treasure over-flowing.<br>
  Without the Lord's Name, there is no liberation; so says Nanak, the meek. ||4||2||<br>

  He is the Lord, from the beginning, throughout the ages, now and forevermore; know that all else is false.<br>
  If one does not appreciate the value of good deeds and Dharmic faith, how can one obtain clarity of consciousness and liberation?<br>
  O Nanak, the Gurmukh realizes the Word of the Shabad; night and day, he meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||<br>
  My mind, my mind has come to accept, that the Naam is our only Friend.<br>
  Egotism, worldly attachment, and the lures of Maya shall not go with you.<br>
  Mother, father, famliy, children, cleverness, property and spouses - none of these shall go with you.<br>
  I have renounced Maya, the daughter of the ocean; reflecting upon reality, I have trampled it under my feet.<br>
  The Primal Lord has revealed this wondrous show; wherever I look, there I see Him.<br>
  O Nanak, I shall not forsake the Lord's devotional worship; in the natural course, what shall be, shall be. ||2||<br>
  My mind, my mind has become immaculately pure, contemplating the True Lord.<br>
  I have dispelled my vices, and now I walk in the company of the virtuous.<br>
  Discarding my vices, I do good deeds, and in the True Court, I am judged as true.<br>
  My coming and going has come to an end; as Gurmukh, I reflect upon the nature of reality.<br>
  O my Dear Friend, You are my all-knowing companion; grant me the glory of Your True Name.<br>
  O Nanak, the jewel of the Naam has been revealed to me; such are the Teachings I have received from the Guru. ||3||<br>
  I have carefully applied the healing ointment to my eyes, and I am attuned to the Immaculate Lord.<br>
  He is permeating my mind and body, the Life of the world, the Lord, the Great Giver.<br>
  My mind is imbued with the Lord, the Great Giver, the Life of the world; I have merged and blended with Him, with intuitive ease.<br>
  In the Company of the Holy, and the Saints' Society, by God's Grace, peace is obtained.<br>

  Dedicate yourself to the worship of your Husband Lord; this is pleasing to your Beloved Husband.<br>
  If you walk in accordance with your own will, then your Husband Lord will not be pleased with you.<br>
  This path of loving devotional worship is very difficult; how rare are those who find it, through the Gurdwara, the Guru's Gate.<br>
  Says Nanak, that one, upon whom the Lord casts His Glance of Grace, links his consciousness to the worship of the Lord. ||1||<br>
  O my detached mind, unto whom do you show your detachment?<br>
  Those who sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord live in the joy of the Lord, forever and ever.<br>
  So become detached, and renounce hypocrisy; Your Husband Lord knows everything.<br>
  The One Lord is pervading the water, the land and the sky; the Gurmukh realizes the Command of His Will.<br>
  One who realizes the Lord's Command, obtains all peace and comforts.<br>
  Thus says Nanak: such a detached soul remains absorbed in the Lord's Love, day and night. ||2||<br>
  Wherever you wander, O my mind, the Lord is there with you.<br>
  Renounce your cleverness, O my mind, and reflect upon the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<br>
  Your Husband Lord is always with you, if you remember the Lord's Name, even for an instant.<br>
  The sins of countless incarnations shall be washed away, and in the end, you shall obtain the supreme status.<br>
  You shall be linked to the True Lord, and as Gurmukh, remember Him forever.<br>
  Thus says Nanak: wherever you go, O my mind, the Lord is there with you. ||3||<br>
  Meeting the True Guru, the wandering mind is held steady; it comes to abide in its own home.<br>
  It purchases the Naam, chants the Naam, and remains absorbed in the Naam.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 095</h2></center>
  The outgoing, wandering soul, upon meeting the True Guru, opens the Tenth Gate.<br>
  There, Ambrosial Nectar is food and the celestial music resounds; the world is held spell-bound by the music of the Word.<br>
  The many strains of the unstruck melody resound there, as one merges in Truth.<br>
  Thus says Nanak: by meeting the True Guru, the wandering soul becomes steady, and comes to dwell in the home of its own self. ||4||<br>
  O my mind, you are the embodiment of the Divine Light - recognize your own origin.<br>
  O my mind, the Dear Lord is with you; through the Guru's Teachings, enjoy His Love.<br>
  Acknowledge your origin, and then you shall know your Husband Lord, and so understand death and birth.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, know the One; then, you shall not love any other.<br>
  Peace comes to the mind, and gladness resounds; then, you shall be acclaimed.<br>
  Thus says Nanak: O my mind, you are the very image of the Luminous Lord; recognize the true origin of your self. ||5||<br>
  O mind, you are so full of pride; loaded with pride, you shall depart.<br>
  The fascinating Maya has fascinated you, over and over again, and lured you into reincarnation.<br>
  Clinging to pride, you shall depart, O foolish mind, and in the end, you shall regret and repent.<br>
  You are afflicted with the diseases of ego and desire, and you are wasting your life away in vain.<br>
  The foolish self-willed manmukh does not remember the Lord, and shall regret and repent hereafter.<br>
  Thus says Nanak: O mind, you are full of pride; loaded with pride, you shall depart. ||6||<br>
  O mind, don't be so proud of yourself, as if you know it all; the Gurmukh is humble and modest.<br>
  Within the intellect are ignorance and ego; through the True Word of the Shabad, this filth is washed off.<br>
  So be humble, and surrender to the True Guru; do not attach your identity to your ego.<br>
  The world is consumed by ego and self-identity; see this, lest you lose your own self as well.<br>
  Make yourself follow the Sweet Will of the True Guru; remain attached to His Sweet Will.<br>
  Thus says Nanak: renounce your ego and self-conceit, and obtain peace; let your mind abide in humility. ||7||<br>
  Blessed is that time, when I met the True Guru, and my Husband Lord came into my consciousness.<br>
  I became so very blissful, and my mind and body found such a natural peace.<br>
  My Husband Lord came into my consciousness; I enshrined Him within my mind, and I renounced all vice.<br>
  When it pleased Him, virtues appeared in me, and the True Guru Himself adorned me.<br>
  Those humble beings become acceptable, who cling to the One Name and renounce the love of duality.<br>
  Thus says Nanak: blessed is the time when I met the True Guru, and my Husband Lord came into my consciousness. ||8||<br>
  Some people wander around, deluded by doubt; their Husband Lord Himself has misled them.<br>
  They wander around in the love of duality, and they do their deeds in ego.<br>
  Their Husband Lord Himself has misled them, and put them on the path of evil. Nothing lies in their power.<br>
  You alone know their ups and downs, You, who created the creation.<br>
  The Command of Your Will is very strict; how rare is the Gurmukh who understands.<br>
  Thus says Nanak: what can the poor creatures do, when You mislead them into doubt? ||9||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 096</h2></center>
  O My True Lord Master, True is Your glorious greatness.<br>
  You are the Supreme Lord God, the Infinite Lord and Master. Your creative power cannot be described.<br>
  True is Your glorious greatness; when You enshrine it within the mind, one sings Your Glorious Praises forever.<br>
  He sings Your Glorious Praises, when it is pleasing to You, O True Lord; he centers his consciousness on You.<br>
  One whom You unite with Yourself, as Gurmukh, remains absorbed in You.<br>
  Thus says Nanak: O my True Lord Master, True is Your Glorious Greatness. ||10||2||7||5||2||7||<br>

  He has enshrined the Name of the Lord, Har, Har within my breath of lfe, and all my doubts and sorrows have departed.<br>
  I have meditated on the invisible and unapproachable Lord, through the Guru's Word, and I have obtained the pure, supreme status.<br>
  The unstruck melody resounds, and the instruments ever vibrate, singing the Bani of the True Guru.<br>
  O Nanak, God the Great Giver has given me a gift; He has blended my light into the Light. ||1||<br>
  The self-willed manmukhs die in their self-willed stubbornness, declaring that the wealth of Maya is theirs.<br>
  They attach their consciousness to the foul-smelling pile of filth, which comes for a moment, and departs in an instant.<br>
  They attach their consciousness to the foul-smelling pile of filth, which is transitory, like the fading color of the safflower.<br>
  One moment, they are facing east, and the next instant, they are facing west; they continue spinning around, like the potter's wheel.<br>
  In sorrow, they eat, and in sorrow, they gather things and try to enjoy them, but they only increase their stores of sorrow.<br>
  O Nanak, one easily crosses over the terrifying world-ocean, when he comes to the Sanctuary of the Guru. ||2||<br>
  My Lord, my Lord Master is sublime, unapproachable and unfathomable.<br>
  The wealth of the Lord - I seek the wealth of the Lord, from my True Guru, the Divine Banker.<br>
  I seek the wealth of the Lord, to purchase the Naam; I sing and love the Glorious Praises of the Lord.<br>
  I have totally renounced sleep and hunger, and through deep meditation, I am absorbed into the Absolute Lord.<br>
  The traders of one kind come and take away the Name of the Lord as their profit.<br>
  O Nanak, dedicate your mind and body to the Guru; one who is so destined, attains it. ||3||<br>
  The great ocean is full of the treasures of jewels upon jewels.<br>
  Those who are committed to the Word of the Guru's Bani, see them come into their hands.<br>
  This priceless, incomparable jewel comes into the hands of those who are committed to the Word of the Guru's Bani.<br>
  They obtain the immeasurable Name of the Lord, Har, Har; their treasure is overflowing with devotional worship.<br>
  I have churned the ocean of the body, and I have seen the incomparable thing come into view.<br>
  The Guru is God, and God is the Guru, O Nanak; there is no difference between the two, O Siblings of Destiny. ||4||1||8||<br>

 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 097</h2></center>
  As Gurmukh, the Gurmukh beholds the Lord, the Beloved Lord.<br>
  The Name of the Lord, the Emancipator of the world, is dear to him; the Name of the Lord is his glory.<br>
  In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Lord's Name is the boat, which carries the Gurmukh across.<br>
  This world, and the world hereafter, are adorned with the Lord's Name; the Gurmukh's lifestyle is the most excellent.<br>
  O Nanak, bestowing His kindness, the Lord gives the gift of His emancipating Name. ||1||<br>
  I chant the Name of the Lord, Raam, Raam, which destroys my sorrows and erases my sins.<br>
  Associating with the Guru, associating with the Guru, I practice meditation; I have enshrined the Lord within my heart.<br>
  I enshrined the Lord within my heart, and obtained the supreme status, when I came to the Sanctuary of the Guru.<br>
  My boat was sinking under the weight of greed and corruption, but it was uplifted when the True Guru implanted the Naam, the Name of the Lord, within me.<br>
  The Perfect Guru has given me the gift of spiritual life, and I center my consciousness on the Lord's Name.<br>
  The Merciful Lord Himself has mercifully given this gift to me; O Nanak, I take to the Sanctuary of the Guru. ||2||<br>
  Hearing the Bani of the Lord's Name, all my affairs were brought to perfection and embellished.<br>
  With each and every hair, with each and every hair, as Gurmukh, I meditate on the Lord.<br>

  My mind and body are totally adorned with peace and tranquility; through the Guru's Teachings, the Lord has been revealed to me.<br>
  The Lord Himself has shown His kind mercy to Nanak; He has made me the slave of the slaves of His slaves. ||3||<br>
  Those who forget the Name of the Lord, Raam, Raam, are foolish, unfortunate, self-willed manmukhs.<br>
  Within, they are engrossed in emotional attachment; each and every moment, Maya clings to them.<br>
  The filth of Maya clings to them, and they become unfortunate fools - they do not love the Lord's Name.<br>
  The egotistical and proud perform all sorts of rituals, but they shy away from the Lord's Name.<br>
  The path of Death is very arduous and painful; it is stained with the darkness of emotional attachment.<br>
  O Nanak, the Gurmukh meditates on the Naam, and finds the gate of salvation. ||4||<br>
  The Name of the Lord, Raam, Raam, and the Lord Guru, are known by the Gurmukh.<br>
  One moment, this mind is in the heavens, and the next, it is in the nether regions; the Guru brings the wandering mind back to one-pointedness.<br>
  When the mind returns to one-pointedness, one totally understands the value of salvation, and enjoys the subtle essence of the Lord's Name.<br>
  The Lord's Name preserves the honor of His servant, as He preserved and emancipated Prahlaad.<br>
  So repeat continually the Name of the Lord, Raam, Raam; chanting His Glorious Virtues, His limit cannot be found.<br>
  Nanak is drenched in happiness, hearing the Name of the Lord; he is merged in the Name of the Lord. ||5||<br>
  Those beings, whose minds are filled the Lord's Name, forsake all anxiety.<br>
  They obtain all wealth, and all Dharmic faith, and the fruits of their minds' desires.<br>
  They obtain the fruits of their hearts' desires, meditating on the Lord's Name, and singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord's Name.<br>
  Evil-mindedness and duality depart, and their understanding is enlightened. They attach their minds to the Name of the Lord.<br>

  O Nanak, by continually vibrating upon the Lord, day and night, the Gurmukhs abide in the home of the inner self. ||6||<br>
  Those who place their faith in the Lord's Name, do not attach their consciousness to another.<br>
  Even if the entire earth were to be transformed into gold, and given to them, without the Naam, they love nothing else.<br>
  The Lord's Name is pleasing to their minds, and they obtain supreme peace; when they depart in the end, it shall go with them as their support.<br>
  I have gathered the capital, the wealth of the Lord's Name; it does not sink, and does not depart.<br>
  The Lord's Name is the only true support in this age; the Messenger of Death does not draw near it.<br>
  O Nanak, the Gurmukhs recognize the Lord; in His Mercy, He unites them with Himself. ||7||<br>

  This soul wandered through countless incarnations, until the True Guru instructed it in the Word of the Shabad.<br>

  All the hours are the milk-maids, and the quarters of the day are the Krishnas.<br>

  They beat the drums for the sake of bread.<br>
  They throw themselves upon the ground.<br>

  The Lord is fearless and formless; His Name is True.<br>
  The entire universe is His Creation.<br>
  Those servants, whose destiny is awakened, serve the Lord.<br>
  The night of their lives is cool with dew; their minds are filled with love for the Lord.<br>
  Contemplating the Guru, I have been taught these teachings;<br>

  the spinning tops, the churning sticks, the threshers,<br>
  the breathless tumblings of the birds,<br>
  and the men moving round and round on spindles<br>
  - O Nanak, the tumblers are countless and endless.<br>
  The Lord binds us in bondage - so do we spin around.<br>
  According to their actions, so do all people dance.<br>
  Those who dance and dance and laugh, shall weep on their ultimate departure.<br>
  They do not fly to the heavens, nor do they become Siddhas.<br>
  They dance and jump around on the urgings of their minds.<br>

  The Hindus praise the Praiseworthy Lord; the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, His form is incomparable.<br>
  They bathe at sacred shrines of pilgrimage, making offerings of flowers, and burning incense before idols.<br>
  The Yogis meditate on the absolute Lord there; they call the Creator the Unseen Lord.<br>

  They give and give, but ask a thousand-fold more, and hope that the world will honor them.<br>
  The thieves, adulterers, perjurers, evil-doers and sinners<br>
  - after using up what good karma they had, they depart; have they done any good deeds here at all?<br>
  There are beings and creatures in the water and on the land, in the worlds and universes, form upon form.<br>
  Whatever they say, You know; You care for them all.<br>

  Ego is a chronic disease, but it contains its own cure as well.<br>

  One who does not eat the corn, misses out on the taste.<br>
  One obtains great pain, in the love of duality.<br>
  One who does not wear any clothes,<br>

  In the Golden Age of Sat Yuga, contentment was the chariot and righteousness the charioteer.<br>
  In the Silver Age of Traytaa Yuga, celibacy was the chariot and power the charioteer.<br>
  In the Brass Age of Dwaapar Yuga, penance was the chariot and truth the charioteer.<br>

  The Rig Veda says that God is permeating and pervading everywhere;<br>
  among the deities, the Lord's Name is the most exalted.<br>
  Chanting the Name, sins depart;<br>
  O Nanak, then, one obtains salvation.<br>
  In the Jujar Veda, Kaan Krishna of the Yaadva tribe seduced Chandraavali by force.<br>
  He brought the Elysian Tree for his milk-maid, and revelled in Brindaaban.<br>
  In the Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Atharva Veda became prominent; Allah became the Name of God.<br>
  Men began to wear blue robes and garments; Turks and Pat'haans assumed power.<br>
  The four Vedas each claim to be true.<br>
  Reading and studying them, four doctrines are found.<br>
  With loving devotional worship, abiding in humility, O Nanak, salvation is attained. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  I am a sacrifice to the True Guru; meeting Him, I have come to cherish the Lord Master.<br>
  He has taught me and given me the healing ointment of spiritual wisdom, and with these eyes, I behold the world.<br>

  The simmal tree is straight as an arrow; it is very tall, and very thick.<br>
  But those birds which visit it hopefully, depart disappointed.<br>
  Its fruits are tasteless, its flowers are nauseating, and its leaves are useless.<br>
  Sweetness and humility, O Nanak, are the essence of virtue and goodness.<br>
  Everyone bows down to himself; no one bows down to another.<br>
  When something is placed on the balancing scale and weighed, the side which descends is heavier.<br>
  The sinner, like the deer hunter, bows down twice as much.<br>
  But what can be achieved by bowing the head, when the heart is impure? ||1||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  You read your books and say your prayers, and then engage in debate;<br>
  you worship stones and sit like a stork, pretending to be in Samaadhi.<br>

  you recite the three lines of the Gayatri three times a day.<br>
  Around your neck is a rosary, and on your forehead is a sacred mark;<br>

  If you knew the nature of God,<br>
  you would know that all of these beliefs and rituals are in vain.<br>
  Says Nanak, meditate with deep faith;<br>
  without the True Guru, no one finds the Way. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>

  This is the sacred thread of the soul; if you have it, then go ahead and put it on me.<br>
  It does not break, it cannot be soiled by filth, it cannot be burnt, or lost.<br>
  Blessed are those mortal beings, O Nanak, who wear such a thread around their necks.<br>
  You buy the thread for a few shells, and seated in your enclosure, you put it on.<br>
  Whispering instructions into others' ears, the Brahmin becomes a guru.<br>

  He commits thousands of robberies, thousands of acts of adultery, thousands of falsehoods and thousands of abuses.<br>
  He practices thousands of deceptions and secret deeds, night and day, against his fellow beings.<br>

  The goat is killed, cooked and eaten, and everyone then says, "Put on the sacred thread."<br>

  The Brahmin himself goes to the world hereafter without a sacred thread.<br>
  Twisting the threads, he puts them on others.<br>
  He takes payment for performing marriages;<br>
  reading their horoscopes, he shows them the way.<br>
  Hear, and see, O people, this wondrous thing.<br>

  O Nanak, impurity cannot be removed in this way; it is washed away only by spiritual wisdom. ||1||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  The impurity of the mind is greed, and the impurity of the tongue is falsehood.<br>
  The impurity of the eyes is to gaze upon the beauty of another man's wife, and his wealth.<br>
  The impurity of the ears is to listen to the slander of others.<br>
  O Nanak, the mortal's soul goes, bound and gagged to the city of Death. ||2||<br>

  When the Lord causes us to meet the Guru, then we come to see them.<br>
  When it pleases Him, they come to dwell in our minds.<br>
  By His Command, when He places His hand on our foreheads, wickedness departs from within.<br>
  When the Lord is thoroughly pleased, the nine treasures are obtained. ||18||<br>
  Shalok, First Mehl:<br>
  First, purifying himself, the Brahmin comes and sits in his purified enclosure.<br>
  The pure foods, which no one else has touched, are placed before him.<br>
  Being purified, he takes his food, and begins to read his sacred verses.<br>
  But it is then thrown into a filthy place - whose fault is this?<br>
  The corn is sacred, the water is sacred; the fire and salt are sacred as well; when the fifth thing, the ghee, is added,<br>
  then the food becomes pure and sanctified.<br>
  Coming into contact with the sinful human body, the food becomes so impure that is is spat upon.<br>
  That mouth which does not chant the Naam, and without the Name eats tasty foods<br>
  - O Nanak, know this: such a mouth is to be spat upon. ||1||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  From woman, man is born; within woman, man is conceived; to woman he is engaged and married.<br>
  Woman becomes his friend; through woman, the future generations come.<br>
  When his woman dies, he seeks another woman; to woman he is bound.<br>
  So why call her bad? From her, kings are born.<br>
  From woman, woman is born; without woman, there would be no one at all.<br>
  O Nanak, only the True Lord is without a woman.<br>
  That mouth which praises the Lord continually is blessed and beautiful.<br>
  O Nanak, those faces shall be radiant in the Court of the True Lord. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  All call You their own, Lord; one who does not own You, is picked up and thrown away.<br>
  Everyone receives the rewards of his own actions; his account is adjusted accordingly.<br>
  Since one is not destined to remain in this world anyway, why should he ruin himself in pride?<br>
  Do not call anyone bad; read these words, and understand.<br>
  Don't argue with fools. ||19||<br>
  Shalok, First Mehl:<br>
  O Nanak, speaking insipid words, the body and mind become insipid.<br>
  He is called the most insipid of the insipid; the most insipid of the insipid is his reputation.<br>
  The insipid person is discarded in the Court of the Lord, and the insipid one's face is spat upon.<br>
  The insipid one is called a fool; he is beaten with shoes in punishment. ||1||<br>
  First Mehl:<br>
  Those who are false within, and honorable on the outside, are very common in this world.<br>
  Even though they may bathe at the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage, still, their filth does not depart.<br>
  Those who have silk on the inside and rags on the outside, are the good ones in this world.<br>
  They embrace love for the Lord, and contemplate beholding Him.<br>
  In the Lord's Love, they laugh, and in the Lord's Love, they weep, and also keep silent.<br>
  They do not care for anything else, except their True Husband Lord.<br>
  Sitting, waiting at the Lord's Door, they beg for food, and when He gives to them, they eat.<br>
  There is only One Court of the Lord, and He has only one pen; there, you and I shall meet.<br>
  In the Court of the Lord, the accounts are examined; O Nanak, the sinners are crushed, like oil seeds in the press. ||2||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 128</h2></center>
  Pauree:<br>
  You Yourself created the creation; You Yourself infused Your power into it.<br>
  You behold Your creation, like the losing and winning dice of the earth.<br>
  Whoever has come, shall depart; all shall have their turn.<br>
  He who owns our soul, and our very breath of life - why should we forget that Lord and Master from our minds?<br>
  With our own hands, let us resolve our own affairs. ||20||<br>
  Shalok, Second Mehl:<br>
  What sort of love is this, which clings to duality?<br>
  O Nanak, he alone is called a lover, who remains forever immersed in absorption.<br>
  But one who feels good only when good is done for him, and feels bad when things go badly<br>
  - do not call him a lover. He trades only for his own account. ||1||<br>
  Second Mehl:<br>
  One who offers both respectful greetings and rude refusal to his master, has gone wrong from the very beginning.<br>
  O Nanak, both of his actions are false; he obtains no place in the Court of the Lord. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  Serving Him, peace is obtained; meditate and dwell upon that Lord and Master forever.<br>
  Why do you do such evil deeds, that you shall have to suffer so?<br>
  Do not do any evil at all; look ahead to the future with foresight.<br>
  So throw the dice in such a way, that you shall not lose with your Lord and Master.<br>
  Do those deeds which shall bring you profit. ||21||<br>
  Shalok, Second Mehl:<br>
  If a servant performs service, while being vain and argumentative,<br>
  he may talk as much as he wants, but he shall not be pleasing to his Master.<br>
  But if he eliminates his self-conceit and then performs service, he shall be honored.<br>
  O Nanak, if he merges with the one with whom he is attached, his attachment becomes acceptable. ||1||<br>
  Second Mehl:<br>
  Whatever is in the mind, comes forth; spoken words by themselves are just wind.<br>
  He sows seeds of poison, and demands Ambrosial Nectar. Behold - what justice is this? ||2||<br>
  Second Mehl:<br>
  Friendship with a fool never works out right.<br>
  As he knows, he acts; behold, and see that it is so.<br>
  One thing can be absorbed into another thing, but duality keeps them apart.<br>
  No one can issue commands to the Lord Master; offer instead humble prayers.<br>
  Practicing falsehood, only falsehood is obtained. O Nanak, through the Lord's Praise, one blossoms forth. ||3||<br>
  Second Mehl:<br>
  Friendship with a fool, and love with a pompous person,<br>
  are like lines drawn in water, leaving no trace or mark. ||4||<br>
  Second Mehl:<br>
  If a fool does a job, he cannot do it right.<br>
  Even if he does something right, he does the next thing wrong. ||5||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  If a servant, performing service, obeys the Will of his Master,<br>
  his honor increases, and he receives double his wages.<br>
  But if he claims to be equal to his Master, he earns his Master's displeasure.<br>
  He loses his entire salary, and is also beaten on his face with shoes.<br>
  Let us all celebrate Him, from whom we receive our nourishment.<br>
  O Nanak, no one can issue commands to the Lord Master; let us offer prayers instead. ||22||<br>
  Shalok, Second Mehl:<br>
  What sort of gift is this, which we receive only by our own asking?<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 129</h2></center>
  O Nanak, that is the most wonderful gift, which is received from the Lord, when He is totally pleased. ||1||<br>
  Second Mehl:<br>
  What sort of service is this, by which the fear of the Lord Master does not depart?<br>
  O Nanak, he alone is called a servant, who merges with the Lord Master. ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  O Nanak, the Lord's limits cannot be known; He has no end or limitation.<br>
  He Himself creates, and then He Himself destroys.<br>
  Some have chains around their necks, while some ride on many horses.<br>
  He Himself acts, and He Himself causes us to act. Unto whom should I complain?<br>
  O Nanak, the One who created the creation - He Himself takes care of it. ||23||<br>
  Shalok, First Mehl:<br>
  He Himself fashioned the vessel of the body, and He Himself fills it.<br>
  Into some, milk is poured, while others remain on the fire.<br>
  Some lie down and sleep on soft beds, while others remain watchful.<br>
  He adorns those, O Nanak, upon whom He casts His Glance of Grace. ||1||<br>
  Second Mehl:<br>
  He Himself creates and fashions the world, and He Himself keeps it in order.<br>
  Having created the beings within it, He oversees their birth and death.<br>
  Unto whom should we speak, O Nanak, when He Himself is all-in-all? ||2||<br>
  Pauree:<br>
  The description of the greatness of the Great Lord cannot be described.<br>
  He is the Creator, all-lowerful and benevolent; He gives sustenance to all beings.<br>
  The mortal does that work, which has been pre-destined from the very beginning.<br>
  O Nanak, except for the One Lord, there is no other place at all.<br>
  He does whatever He wills. ||24||1||<br>
  Sudh||One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. No Fear. No Hatred. Image Of The Undying. Beyond Birth. Self-Existent. By Guru's Grace:<br>
  Raag Aasaa, The Word Of The Devotees:<br>
  Kabeer, Naam Dayv And Ravi Daas.<br>
  Aasaa, Kabeer Jee:<br>
  Falling at the Feet of the Guru, I pray, and ask Him, "Why was man created?<br>
  What deeds cause the world to come into being, and be destroyed? Tell me, that I may understand."||1||<br>
  O Divine Guru, please, show Mercy to me, and place me on the right path, by which the bonds of fear may be cut away.<br>
  The pains of birth and death come from past actions and karma; peace comes when the soul finds release from reincarnation. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The mortal does not break free from the bonds of the noose of Maya, and he does not seek the shelter of the profound, absolute Lord.<br>
  He does not realize the dignity of the self, and Nirvaanaa; because of this, his doubt does not depart. ||2||<br>
  The soul is not born, even though he thinks it is born; it is free from birth and death.<br>
  When the mortal gives up his ideas of birth and death, he remains constantly absorbed in the Lord's Love. ||3||<br>
  As the reflection of an object blends in the water when the pitcher is broken,<br>
  says Kabeer, just so virtue dispels doubt, and then the soul is absorbed in the profound, absolute Lord. ||4||1||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 130</h2></center>
  Aasaa:<br>
  They wear loin cloths, three and a half yards long, and triple-wound sacred threads.<br>
  They have rosaries around their necks, and they carry glittering jugs in their hands.<br>
  They are not called Saints of the Lord - they are thugs of Benares. ||1||<br>
  Such 'saints' are not pleasing to me;<br>
  they eat the trees along with the branches. ||1||Pause||<br>
  They wash their pots and pans before putting them on the stove, and they wash the wood before lighting it.<br>
  They dig up the earth and make two fireplaces, but they eat the whole person! ||2||<br>
  Those sinners continually wander in evil deeds, while they call themselves touch-nothing saints.<br>
  They wander around forever and ever in their self-conceit, and all their families are drowned. ||3||<br>
  He is attached to that, to which the Lord has attached him, and he acts accordingly.<br>
  Says Kabeer, one who meets the True Guru, is not reincarnated again. ||4||2||<br>
  Aasaa:<br>
  My Father has comforted me. He has given me a cozy bed, and placed His Ambrosial Nectar in my mouth.<br>
  How could I forget that Father from my mind?<br>
  When I go to the world hereafter, I shall not lose the game. ||1||<br>
  Maya is dead, O mother, and I am very happy.<br>
  I do not wear the patched coat, nor do I feel the chill. ||1||Pause||<br>
  I am a sacrifice to my Father, who gave me life.<br>
  He put an end to my association with the five deadly sins.<br>
  I have conquered those five demons, and trampled them underfoot.<br>
  Remembering the Lord in meditation, my mind and body are drenched with His Love. ||2||<br>
  My Father is the Great Lord of the Universe.<br>
  How shall I go to that Father?<br>
  When I met the True Guru, He showed me the Way.<br>
  The Father of the Universe is pleasing to my mind. ||3||<br>
  I am Your son, and You are my Father.<br>
  We both dwell in the same place.<br>
  Says Kabeer, the Lord's humble servant knows only the One.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, I have come to know everything. ||4||3||<br>
  Aasaa:<br>
  In one pot, they put a boiled chicken, and in the other pot, they put wine.<br>
  The five Yogis of the Tantric ritual sit there, and in their midst sits the noseless one, the shameless queen. ||1||<br>
  The bell of the shameless queen, Maya, rings in both worlds.<br>
  Some rare person of discriminating wisdom has cut off your nose. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Within all dwells the noseless Maya, who kills all, and destroys them.<br>
  She says, "I am the sister, and the daughter of the sister of everyone; I am the hand-maiden of one who marries me."||2||<br>
  My Husband is the Great One of discriminating wisdom; He alone is called a Saint.<br>
  He stands by me, and no one else comes near me. ||3||<br>
  I have cut off her nose, and cut off her ears, and cutting her into bits, I have expelled her.<br>
  Says Kabeer, she is the darling of the three worlds, but the enemy of the Saints. ||4||4||<br>
  Aasaa:<br>
  The Yogis, celibates, penitents and Sannyaasees make pilgrimages to all the sacred places.<br>
  The Jains with shaven heads, the silent ones, the beggars with matted hair - in the end, they all shall die. ||1||<br>
  Meditate, therefore, on the Lord.<br>
  What can the Messenger of Death do to one whose tongue loves the Name of the Lord? ||1||Pause||<br>
  Those who know the Shaastras and the Vedas, astrology and the rules of grammar of many languages;<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 131</h2></center>
  those who know Tantras and mantras and all medicines - even they shall die in the end. ||2||<br>
  Those who enjoy regal power and rule, royal canopies and thrones, many beautiful women,<br>
  betel nuts, camphor and fragrant sandalwood oil - in the end, they too shall die. ||3||<br>
  I have searched all the Vedas, Puraanas and Simritees, but none of these can save anyone.<br>
  Says Kabeer, meditate on the Lord, and eliminate birth and death. ||4||5||<br>
  Aasaa:<br>
  The elephant is the guitar player, the ox is the drummer, and the crow plays the cymbals.<br>
  Putting on the skirt, the donkey dances around, and the water buffalo performs devotional worship. ||1||<br>
  The Lord, the King, has cooked the cakes of ice,<br>
  but only the rare man of understanding eats them. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Sitting in his den, the lion prepares the betel leaves, and the muskrat brings the betel nuts.<br>
  Going from house to house, the mouse sings the songs of joy, and the turtle blows on the conch-shell. ||2||<br>
  The son of the sterile woman goes to get married, and the golden canopy is spread out for him.<br>
  He marries a beautiful and enticing young woman; the rabbit and the lion sing their praises. ||3||<br>
  Says Kabeer, listen, O Saints - the ant has eaten the mountain.<br>
  The turtle says, "I need a burning coal, also." Listen to this mystery of the Shabad. ||4||6||<br>
  Aasaa:<br>
  The body is a bag with seventy-two chambers, and one opening, the Tenth Gate.<br>
  He alone is a real Yogi on this earth, who asks for the primal world of the nine regions. ||1||<br>
  Such a Yogi obtains the nine treasures.<br>
  He lifts his soul up from below, to the skies of the Tenth Gate. ||1||Pause||<br>
  He makes spiritual wisdom his patched coat, and meditation his needle. He twists the thread of the Word of the Shabad.<br>
  Making the five elements his deer skin to sit on, he walks on the Guru's Path. ||2||<br>
  He makes compassion his shovel, his body the firewood, and he kindles the fire of divine vision.<br>
  He places love within his heart, and he remains in deep meditation throughout the four ages. ||3||<br>
  All Yoga is in the Name of the Lord; the body and the breath of life belong to Him.<br>
  Says Kabeer, if God grants His Grace, He bestows the insignia of Truth. ||4||7||<br>
  Aasaa:<br>
  Where have the Hindus and Muslims come from? Who put them on their different paths?<br>
  Think of this, and contemplate it within your mind, O men of evil intentions. Who will go to heaven and hell? ||1||<br>
  O Qazi, which book have you read?<br>
  Such scholars and students have all died, and none of them have discovered the inner meaning. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Because of the love of woman, circumcision is done; I don't believe in it, O Siblings of Destiny.<br>
  If God wished me to be a Muslim, it would be cut off by itself. ||2||<br>
  If circumcision makes one a Muslim, then what about a woman?<br>
  She is the other half of a man's body, and she does not leave him, so he remains a Hindu. ||3||<br>
  Give up your holy books, and remember the Lord, you fool, and stop oppressing others so badly.<br>
  Kabeer has grasped hold of the Lord's Support, and the Muslims have utterly failed. ||4||8||<br>
  Aasaa:<br>
  As long as the oil and the wick are in the lamp, everything is illuminated.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 132</h2></center>
  But when the oil is burnt, the wick goes out, and the mansion becomes desolate. ||1||<br>
  O mad-man, no one will keep you, for even a moment.<br>
  Meditate on the Name of that Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Tell me, whose mother is that, whose father is that, and which man has a wife?<br>
  When the pitcher of the body breaks, no one cares for you at all. Everyone says, "Take him away, take him away!"||2||<br>
  Sitting on the threshold, his mother cries, and his brothers take away the coffin.<br>
  Taking down her hair, his wife cries out in sorrow, and the swan-soul departs all alone. ||3||<br>
  Says Kabeer, listen, O Saints, about the terrifying world-ocean.<br>
  This human suffers torture and the Messenger of Death will not leave him alone, O Lord of the World. ||4||9||<br>
  Du-Tukas<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Aasaa Of Kabeer Jee, Chau-Padas, Ik-Tukas:<br>
  Sanak and Sanand, the sons of Brahma, could not find the Lord's limits.<br>
  Brahma wasted his life away, continually reading the Vedas. ||1||<br>
  Churn the churn of the Lord, O my Siblings of Destiny.<br>
  Churn it steadily, so that the essence, the butter, may not be lost. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Make your body the churning jar, and use the stick of your mind to churn it.<br>
  Gather the curds of the Word of the Shabad. ||2||<br>
  The churning of the Lord is to reflect upon Him within your mind.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, the Ambrosial Nectar flows into us. ||3||<br>
  Says Kabeer, if the Lord, our King casts His Glance of Grace,<br>
  one is carried across to the other side, holding fast to the Lord's Name. ||4||1||10||<br>
  Aasaa:<br>
  The wick has dried up, and the oil is exhausted.<br>
  The drum does not sound, and the actor has gone to sleep. ||1||<br>
  The fire has gone out, and no smoke is produced.<br>
  The One Lord is pervading and permeating everywhere; there is no other second. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The string has broken, and the guitar makes no sound.<br>
  He mistakenly ruins his own affairs. ||2||<br>
  When one comes to understand, he forgets his preaching, ranting and raving, and arguing. ||3||<br>
  Says Kabeer, the state of supreme dignity is never far from those who conquer the five demons of the body passions. ||4||2||11||<br>
  Aasaa:<br>
  As many mistakes as the son commits,<br>
  his mother does not hold them against him in her mind. ||1||<br>
  O Lord, I am Your child.<br>
  Why not destroy my sins? ||1||Pause||<br>
  If the son, in anger, runs away,<br>
  even then, his mother does not hold it against him in her mind. ||2||<br>
  My mind has fallen into the whirlpool of anxiety.<br>
  Without the Naam, how can I cross over to the other side? ||3||<br>
  Please, bless my body with pure and lasting understanding, Lord;<br>
  in peace and poise, Kabeer chants the Praises of the Lord. ||4||3||12||<br>
  Aasaa:<br>
  My pilgrimage to Mecca is on the banks of the Gomati River;<br>
  the spiritual teacher in his yellow robes dwells there. ||1||<br>
  Waaho! Waaho! Hail! Hail! How wondrously he sings.<br>
  The Name of the Lord is pleasing to my mind. ||1||Pause||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 133</h2></center>
  Naarada the sage, and Shaarada the goddess of knowledge, serve the Lord.<br>
  The goddess Lakhshmi sits by Him as His slave. ||2||<br>
  The mala is around my neck, and the Lord's Name is upon my tongue.<br>
  I repeat the Naam, the Name of the Lord, a thousand times, and bow in reverence to Him. ||3||<br>
  Says Kabeer, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord;<br>
  I teach both Hindus and Muslims. ||4||4||13||<br>
  Aasaa, Kabeer Jee, 9 Panch-Padas, 5 Du-Tukas:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  You tear off the leaves, O gardener, but in each and every leaf, there is life.<br>
  That stone idol, for which you tear off those leaves - that stone idol is lifeless. ||1||<br>
  In this, you are mistaken, O gardener.<br>
  The True Guru is the Living Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Brahma is in the leaves, Vishnu is in the branches, and Shiva is in the flowers.<br>
  When you break these three gods, whose service are you performing? ||2||<br>
  The sculptor carves the stone and fashions it into an idol, placing his feet upon its chest.<br>
  If this stone god was true, it would devour the sculptor for this! ||3||<br>
  Rice and beans, candies, cakes and cookies<br>
  - the priest enjoys these, while he puts ashes into the mouth of the idol. ||4||<br>
  The gardener is mistaken, and the world is mistaken, but I am not mistaken.<br>
  Says Kabeer, the Lord preserves me; the Lord, my King, has showered His Blessings upon me. ||5||1||14||<br>
  Aasaa:<br>
  Twelve years pass in childhood, and for another twenty years, he does not practice self-discipline and austerity.<br>
  For another thirty years, he does not worship God in any way, and then, when he is old, he repents and regrets. ||1||<br>
  His life wastes away as he cries out, "Mine, mine!"<br>
  The pool of his power has dried up. ||1||Pause||<br>
  He makes a dam around the dried-up pool, and with his hands, he makes a fence around the harvested field.<br>
  When the thief of Death comes, he quickly carries away what the fool had tried to preserve as his own. ||2||<br>
  His feet and head and hands begin to tremble, and the tears flow copiously from his eyes.<br>
  His tongue has not spoken the correct words, but now, he hopes to practice religion! ||3||<br>
  If the Dear Lord shows His Mercy, one enshrines love for Him, and obtains the Profit of the Lord's Name.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, he receives the wealth of the Lord's Name, which alone shall go with him, when he departs in the end. ||4||<br>
  Says Kabeer, listen, O Saints - he shall not take any other wealth with him.<br>
  When the summons comes from the King, the Lord of the Universe, the mortal departs, leaving behind his wealth and mansions. ||5||2||15||<br>
  Aasaa:<br>
  To some, the Lord has given silks and satins, and to some, beds decorated with cotton ribbons.<br>
  Some do not even have a poor patched coat, and some live in thatched huts. ||1||<br>
  Do not indulge in envy and bickering, O my mind.<br>
  By continually doing good deeds, these are obtained, O my mind. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The potter works the same clay, and colors the pots in different ways.<br>
  Into some, he sets pearls, while to others, he attaches filth. ||2||<br>
  God gave wealth to the miser for him to preserve, but the fool calls it his own.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 134</h2></center>
  When the Messenger of Death strikes him with his club, in an instant, everything is settled. ||3||<br>
  The Lord's humble servant is called the most exalted Saint; he obeys the Command of the Lord's Order, and obtains peace.<br>
  Whatever is pleasing to the Lord, he accepts as True; he enshrines the Lord's Will within his mind. ||4||<br>
  Says Kabeer, listen, O Saints - it is false to call out, "Mine, mine."<br>
  Breaking the bird cage, death takes the bird away, and only the torn threads remain. ||5||3||16||<br>
  Aasaa:<br>
  I am Your humble servant, Lord; Your Praises are pleasing to my mind.<br>
  The Lord, the Primal Being, the Master of the poor, does not ordain that they should be oppressed. ||1||<br>
  O Qazi, it is not right to speak before Him. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Keeping your fasts, reciting your prayers, and reading the Kalma, the Islamic creed, shall not take you to paradise.<br>
  The Temple of Mecca is hidden within your mind, if you only knew it. ||2||<br>
  That should be your prayer, to administer justice. Let your Kalma be the knowledge of the unknowable Lord.<br>
  Spread your prayer mat by conquering your five desires, and you shall recognize the true religion. ||3||<br>
  Recognize Your Lord and Master, and fear Him within your heart; conquer your egotism, and make it worthless.<br>
  As you see yourself, see others as well; only then will you become a partner in heaven. ||4||<br>
  The clay is one, but it has taken many forms; I recognize the One Lord within them all.<br>
  Says Kabeer, I have abandoned paradise, and reconciled my mind to hell. ||5||4||17||<br>
  Aasaa:<br>
  From the city of the Tenth Gate, the sky of the mind, not even a drop rains down. Where is the music of the sound current of the Naad, which was contained in it?<br>
  The Supreme Lord God, the Transcendent Lord, the Master of wealth has taken away the Supreme Soul. ||1||<br>
  O Father, tell me: where has it gone? It used to dwell within the body,<br>
  and dance in the mind, teaching and speaking. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Where has the player gone - he who made this temple his own?<br>
  No story, word or understanding is produced; the Lord has drained off all the power. ||2||<br>
  The ears, your companions, have gone deaf, and the power of your organs is exhausted.<br>
  Your feet have failed, your hands have gone limp, and no words issue forth from your mouth. ||3||<br>
  Having grown weary, the five enemies and all the thieves have wandered away according to their own will.<br>
  The elephant of the mind has grown weary, and the heart has grown weary as well; through its power, it used to pull the strings. ||4||<br>
  He is dead, and the bonds of the ten gates are opened; he has left all his friends and brothers.<br>
  Says Kabeer, one who meditates on the Lord, breaks his bonds, even while yet alive. ||5||5||18||<br>
  Aasaa, 4 Ik-Tukas:<br>
  No one is more powerful than the she-serpent Maya,<br>
  who deceived even Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. ||1||<br>
  Having bitten and struck them down, she now sits in the immaculate waters.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, I have seen her, who has bitten the three worlds. ||1||Pause||<br>
  O Siblings of Destiny, why is she called a she-serpent?<br>
  One who realizes the True Lord, devours the she-serpent. ||2||<br>
  No one else is more frivolous than this she-serpent.<br>
  When the she-serpent is overcome, what can the Messengers of the King of Death do? ||3||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 135</h2></center>
  This she-serpent is created by Him.<br>
  What power or weakness does she have by herself? ||4||<br>
  If she abides with the mortal, then his soul abides in his body.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, Kabeer has easily crossed over. ||5||6||19||<br>
  Aasaa:<br>
  Why bother to read the Simritees to a dog?<br>
  Why bother to sing the Lord's Praises to the faithless cynic? ||1||<br>
  Remain absorbed in the Lord's Name, Raam, Raam, Raam.<br>
  Do not bother to speak of it to the faithless cynic, even by mistake. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Why offer camphor to a crow?<br>
  Why give the snake milk to drink? ||2||<br>
  Joining the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, discriminating understanding is attained.<br>
  That iron which touches the Philosopher's Stone becomes gold. ||3||<br>
  The dog, the faithless cynic, does everything as the Lord causes him to do.<br>
  He does the deeds pre-ordained from the very beginning. ||4||<br>
  If you take Ambrosial Nectar and irrigate the neem tree with it,<br>
  still, says Kabeer, its natural qualities are not changed. ||5||7||20||<br>
  Aasaa:<br>
  A fortress like that of Sri Lanka, with the ocean as a moat around it<br>
  - there is no news about that house of Raavan. ||1||<br>
  What shall I ask for? Nothing is permanent.<br>
  I see with my eyes that the world is passing away. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Thousands of sons and thousands of grandsons<br>
  - but in that house of Raavan, the lamps and wicks have gone out. ||2||<br>
  The moon and the sun cooked his food.<br>
  The fire washed his clothes. ||3||<br>
  Under Guru's Instructions, one whose mind is filled with the Lord's Name,<br>
  becomes permanent, and does not go anywhere. ||4||<br>
  Says Kabeer, listen, people:<br>
  without the Lord's Name, no one is liberated. ||5||8||21||<br>
  Aasaa:<br>
  First, the son was born, and then, his mother.<br>
  The guru falls at the feet of the disciple. ||1||<br>
  Listen to this wonderful thing, O Siblings of Destiny!<br>
  I saw the lion herding the cows. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The fish of the water gives birth upon a tree.<br>
  I saw a cat carrying away a dog. ||2||<br>
  The branches are below, and the roots are above.<br>
  The trunk of that tree bears fruits and flowers. ||3||<br>
  Riding a horse, the buffalo takes him out to graze.<br>
  The bull is away, while his load has come home. ||4||<br>
  Says Kabeer, one who understands this hymn,<br>
  and chants the Lord's Name, comes to understand everything. ||5||9||22||<br>
  22 Chau-Padas And Panch-Padas, Aasaa Of Kabeer Jee, 8 Tri-Padas, 7 Du-Tukas, 1 Ik-Tuka:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  The Lord created the body from sperm, and protected it in the fire pit.<br>
  For ten months He preserved you in your mother's womb, and then, after you were born, you became attached to Maya. ||1||<br>
  O mortal, why have you attached yourself to greed, and lost the jewel of life?<br>
  You did not plant the seeds of good actions in the earth of your past lives. ||1||Pause||<br>
  From an infant, you have grown old. That which was to happen, has happened.<br>
  When the Messenger of Death comes and grabs you by your hair, why do you cry out then? ||2||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 136</h2></center>
  You hope for long life, while Death counts your breaths.<br>
  The world is a game, O Kabeer, so throw the dice consciously. ||3||1||23||<br>
  Aasaa:<br>
  I make my body the dying vat, and within it, I dye my mind. I make the five elements my marriage guests.<br>
  I take my marriage vows with the Lord, my King; my soul is imbued with His Love. ||1||<br>
  Sing, sing, O brides of the Lord, the marriage songs of the Lord.<br>
  The Lord, my King, has come to my house as my Husband. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Within the lotus of my heart, I have made my bridal pavilion, and I have spoken the wisdom of God.<br>
  I have obtained the Lord King as my Husband - such is my great good fortune. ||2||<br>
  The angles, holy men, silent sages, and the 330,000,000 deities have come in their heavenly chariots to see this spectacle.<br>
  Says Kabeer, I have been taken in marriage by the One Supreme Being, the Lord God. ||3||2||24||<br>
  Aasaa:<br>
  I am bothered by my mother-in-law, Maya, and loved by my father-in-law, the Lord. I fear even the name of my husband's elder brother, Death.<br>
  O my mates and companions, my husband's sister, misunderstanding has seized me, and I am burning with the pain of separation from my husband's younger brother, divine knowledge. ||1||<br>
  My mind has gone insane, since I forgot the Lord. How can I lead a virtuous lifestyle?<br>
  He rests in the bed of my mind, but I cannot see Him with my eyes. Unto whom should I tell my sufferings? ||1||Pause||<br>
  My step-father, egotism, fights with me, and my mother, desire, is always intoxicated.<br>
  When I stayed with my elder brother, meditation, then I was loved by my Husband Lord. ||2||<br>
  Says Kabeer, the five passions argue with me, and in these arguments, my life is wasting away.<br>
  The false Maya has bound the whole world, but I have obtained peace, chanting the Name of the Lord. ||3||3||25||<br>
  Aasaa:<br>
  In my house, I constantly weave the thread, while you wear the thread around your neck, O Brahmin.<br>
  You read the Vedas and sacred hymns, while I have enshrined the Lord of the Universe in my heart. ||1||<br>
  Upon my tongue, within my eyes, and within my heart, abides the Lord, the Lord of the Universe.<br>
  When you are interrogated at Death's door, O mad-man, what will you say then? ||1||Pause||<br>
  I am a cow, and You are the herdsman, the Sustainer of the World. You are my Saving Grace, lifetime after lifetime.<br>
  You have never taken me across to graze there - what sort of a herdsman are You? ||2||<br>
  You are a Brahmin, and I am a weaver of Benares; can You understand my wisdom?<br>
  You beg from emperors and kings, while I meditate on the Lord. ||3||4||26||<br>
  Aasaa:<br>
  The life of the world is only a dream; life is just a dream.<br>
  Believing it to be true, I grasped at it, and abandoned the supreme treasure. ||1||<br>
  O Father, I have enshrined love and affection for Maya,<br>
  which has taken the jewel of spiritual wisdom away from me. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The moth sees with its eyes, but it still becomes entangled; the insect does not see the fire.<br>
  Attached to gold and woman, the fool does not think of the noose of Death. ||2||<br>
  Reflect upon this, and abandon sin; the Lord is a boat to carry you across.<br>
  Says Kabeer, such is the Lord, the Life of the World; there is no one equal to Him. ||3||5||27||<br>
  Aasaa:<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 137</h2></center>
  In the past, I have taken many forms, but I shall not take form again.<br>
  The strings and wires of the musical instrument are worn out, and I am in the power of the Lord's Name. ||1||<br>
  Now, I no longer dance to the tune.<br>
  My mind no longer beats the drum. ||1||Pause||<br>
  I have burnt away sexual desire, anger and attachment to Maya, and the pitcher of my desires has burst.<br>
  The gown of sensuous pleasures is worn out, and all my doubts have been dispelled. ||2||<br>
  I look upon all beings alike, and my conflict and strife are ended.<br>
  Says Kabeer, when the Lord showed His Favor, I obtained Him, the Perfect One. ||3||6||28||<br>
  Aasaa:<br>
  You keep your fasts to please Allah, while you murder other beings for pleasure.<br>
  You look after your own interests, and so not see the interests of others. What good is your word? ||1||<br>
  O Qazi, the One Lord is within you, but you do not behold Him by thought or contemplation.<br>
  You do not care for others, you are a religious fanatic, and your life is of no account at all. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Your holy scriptures say that Allah is True, and that he is neither male nor female.<br>
  But you gain nothing by reading and studying, O mad-man, if you do not gain the understanding in your heart. ||2||<br>
  Allah is hidden in every heart; reflect upon this in your mind.<br>
  The One Lord is within both Hindu and Muslim; Kabeer proclaims this out loud. ||3||7||29||<br>
  Aasaa, Ti-Pada, Ik-Tuka:<br>
  I have decorated myself to meet my Husband Lord.<br>
  But the Lord, the Life of the Word, the Sustainer of the Universe, has not come to meet me. ||1||<br>
  The Lord is my Husband, and I am the Lord's bride.<br>
  The Lord is so great, and I am infinitesimally small. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The bride and the Groom dwell together.<br>
  They lie upon the one bed, but their union is difficult. ||2||<br>
  Blessed is the soul-bride, who is pleasing to her Husband Lord.<br>
  Says Kabeer, she shall not have to be reincarnated again. ||3||8||30||<br>
  Aasaa Of Kabeer Jee, Du-Padas:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  When the Diamond of the Lord pierces the diamond of my mind, the fickle mind waving in the wind is easily absorbed into Him.<br>
  This Diamond fills all with Divine Light; through the True Guru's Teachings, I have found Him. ||1||<br>
  The sermon of the Lord is the unstruck, endless song.<br>
  Becoming a swan, one recognizes the Diamond of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Says Kabeer, I have seen such a Diamond, permeating and pervading the world.<br>
  The hidden diamond became visible, when the Guru revealed it to me. ||2||1||31||<br>
  Aasaa:<br>
  My first wife, ignorance, was ugly, of low social status and bad character; she was evil in my home, and in her parents' home.<br>
  My present bride, divine understanding, is beautiful, wise and well-behaved; I have taken her to my heart. ||1||<br>
  It has turned out so well, that my first wife has died.<br>
  May she, whom I have now married, live throughout the ages. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Says Kabeer, when the younger bride came, the elder one lost her husband.<br>
  The younger bride is with me now, and the elder one has taken another husband. ||2||2||32||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 138</h2></center>
  Aasaa:<br>
  My daughter-in-law was first called Dhannia, the woman of wealth,<br>
  but now she is called Raam-jannia, the servant of the Lord. ||1||<br>
  These shaven-headed saints have ruined my house.<br>
  They have caused my son to start chanting the Lord's Name. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Says Kabeer, listen, O mother:<br>
  these shaven-headed saints have done away with my low social status. ||2||3||33||<br>
  Aasaa:<br>
  Stay, stay, O daughter-in-law - do not cover your face with a veil.<br>
  In the end, this shall not bring you even half a shell. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The one before you used to veil her face;<br>
  do not follow in her footsteps. ||1||<br>
  The only merit in veiling your face is<br>
  that for a few days, people will say, "What a noble bride has come". ||2||<br>
  Your veil shall be true only if<br>
  you skip, dance and sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||3||<br>
  Says Kabeer, the soul-bride shall win,<br>
  only if she passes her life singing the Lord's Praises. ||4||1||34||<br>
  Aasaa:<br>
  I would rather be cut apart by a saw, than have You turn Your back on me.<br>
  Hug me close, and listen to my prayer. ||1||<br>
  I am a sacrifice to You - please, turn Your face to me, O Beloved Lord.<br>
  Why have You turned Your back to me? Why have You killed me? ||1||Pause||<br>
  Even if You cut my body apart, I shall not pull my limbs away from You.<br>
  Even if my body falls, I shall not break my bonds of love with You. ||2||<br>
  Between You and I, there is no other.<br>
  You are the Husband Lord, and I am the soul-bride. ||3||<br>
  Says Kabeer, listen, O people:<br>
  now, I place no reliance in you. ||4||2||35||<br>
  Aasaa:<br>
  No one knows the secret of God, the Cosmic Weaver.<br>
  He has stretched out the fabric of the whole world. ||1||Pause||<br>
  When you listen to the Vedas and the Puraanas,<br>
  you shall know that the whole world is only a small piece of His woven fabric. ||1||<br>
  He has made the earth and sky His loom.<br>
  Upon it, He moves the two bobbins of the sun and the moon. ||2||<br>
  Placing my feet together, I have accomplished one thing - my mind is pleased with that Weaver.<br>
  I have come to understand my own home, and recognize the Lord within my heart. ||3||<br>
  Says Kabeer, when my body workshop breaks,<br>
  the Weaver shall blend my thread with His thread. ||4||3||36||<br>
  Aasaa:<br>
  With filth within the heart, even if one bathes at sacred places of pilgrimage, still, he shall not go to heaven.<br>
  Nothing is gained by trying to please others - the Lord cannot be fooled. ||1||<br>
  Worship the One Divine Lord.<br>
  The true cleansing bath is service to the Guru. ||1||Pause||<br>
  If salvation can be obtained by bathing in water, then what about the frog, which is always bathing in water?<br>
  As is the frog, so is that mortal; he is reincarnated, over and over again. ||2||<br>
  If the hard-hearted sinner dies in Benaares, he cannot escape hell.<br>
  And even if the Lord's Saint dies in the cursed land of Haramba, still, he saves all his family. ||3||<br>
  Where there is neither day nor night, and neither Vedas nor Shaastras, there, the Formless Lord abides.<br>
  Says Kabeer, meditate on Him, O mad-men of the world. ||4||4||37||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 139</h2></center>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  Aasaa, The Word Of The Reverend Naam Dayv Jee:<br>
  In the one and in the many, He is pervading and permeating; wherever I look, there He is.<br>
  The marvellous image of Maya is so fascinating; how few understand this. ||1||<br>
  God is everything, God is everything. Without God, there is nothing at all.<br>
  As one thread holds hundreds and thousands of beads, He is woven into His creation. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The waves of the water, the foam and bubbles, are not distinct from the water.<br>
  This manifested world is the playful game of the Supreme Lord God; reflecting upon it, we find that it is not different from Him. ||2||<br>
  False doubts and dream objects - man believes them to be true.<br>
  The Guru has instructed me to try to do good deeds, and my awakened mind has accepted this. ||3||<br>
  Says Naam Dayv, see the Creation of the Lord, and reflect upon it in your heart.<br>
  In each and every heart, and deep within the very nucleus of all, is the One Lord. ||4||1||<br>
  Aasaa:<br>
  Bringing the pitcher, I fill it with water, to bathe the Lord.<br>
  But 4.2 million species of beings are in the water - how can I use it for the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny? ||1||<br>
  Wherever I go, the Lord is there.<br>
  He continually plays in supreme bliss. ||1||Pause||<br>
  I bring flowers to weave a garland, in worshipful adoration of the Lord.<br>
  But the bumble bee has already sucked out the fragrance - how can I use it for the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny? ||2||<br>
  I carry milk and cook it to make pudding, with which to feed the Lord.<br>
  But the calf has already tasted the milk - how can I use it for the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny? ||3||<br>
  The Lord is here, the Lord is there; without the Lord, there is no world at all.<br>
  Prays Naam Dayv, O Lord, You are totally permeating and pervading all places and interspaces. ||4||2||<br>
  Aasaa:<br>
  My mind is the yardstick, and my tongue is the scissors.<br>
  I measure it out and cut off the noose of death. ||1||<br>
  What do I have to do with social status? What do I have to with ancestry?<br>
  I meditate on the Name of the Lord, day and night. ||1||Pause||<br>
  I dye myself in the color of the Lord, and sew what has to be sewn.<br>
  Without the Lord's Name, I cannot live, even for a moment. ||2||<br>
  I perform devotional worship, and sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.<br>
  Twenty-four hours a day, I meditate on my Lord and Master. ||3||<br>
  My needle is gold, and my thread is silver.<br>
  Naam Dayv's mind is attached to the Lord. ||4||3||<br>
  Aasaa:<br>
  The snake sheds its skin, but does not lose its venom.<br>
  The heron appears to be meditating, but it is concentrating on the water. ||1||<br>
  Why do you practice meditation and chanting,<br>
  when your mind is not pure? ||1||Pause||<br>
  That man who feeds like a lion,<br>
  is called the god of thieves. ||2||<br>
  Naam Dayv's Lord and Master has settled my inner conflicts.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 140</h2></center>
  Drink in the sublime elixir of the Lord, O deceitful one. ||3||4||<br>
  Aasaa:<br>
  One who recognizes the Supreme Lord God, dislikes other desires.<br>
  He focuses his consciousness on the Lord's devotional worship, and keeps his mind free of anxiety. ||1||<br>
  O my mind, how will you cross over the world-ocean, if you are filled with the water of corruption?<br>
  Gazing upon the falseness of Maya, you have gone astray, O my mind. ||1||Pause||<br>
  You have given me birth in the house of a calico-printer, but I have found the Teachings of the Guru.<br>
  By the Grace of the Saint, Naam Dayv has met the Lord. ||2||5||<br>
  Aasaa, The Word Of The Reverend Ravi Daas Jee:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  The deer, the fish, the bumble bee, the moth and the elephant are destroyed, each for a single defect.<br>
  So the one who is filled with the five incurable vices - what hope is there for him? ||1||<br>
  O Lord, he is in love with ignorance.<br>
  His lamp of clear wisdom has grown dim. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The creeping creatures live thoughtless lives, and cannot discriminate between good and evil.<br>
  It is so difficult to obtain this human incarnation, and yet, they keep company with the low. ||2||<br>
  Wherever the beings and creatures are, they are born according to the karma of their past actions.<br>
  The noose of death is unforgiving, and it shall catch them; it cannot be warded off. ||3||<br>
  O servant Ravi Daas, dispel your sorrow and doubt, and know that Guru-given spiritual wisdom is the penance of penances.<br>
  O Lord, Destroyer of the fears of Your humble devotees, make me supremely blissful in the end. ||4||1||<br>
  Aasaa:<br>
  Your Saints are Your body, and their company is Your breath of life.<br>
  By the True Guru-given spiritual wisdom, I know the Saints as the gods of gods. ||1||<br>
  O Lord, God of gods, grant me the Society of the Saints, the sublime essence of the Saints' conversation, and the Love of the Saints. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The Character of the Saints, the lifestyle of the Saints, and the service of the servant of the Saints. ||2||<br>
  I ask for these, and for one thing more - devotional worship, which shall fulfill my desires.<br>
  Do not show me the wicked sinners. ||3||<br>
  Says Ravi Daas, he alone is wise, who knows this:<br>
  there is no difference between the Saints and the Infinite Lord. ||4||2||<br>
  Aasaa:<br>
  You are sandalwood, and I am the poor castor oil plant, dwelling close to you.<br>
  From a lowly tree, I have become exalted; Your fragrance, Your exquisite fragrance now permeates me. ||1||<br>
  O Lord, I seek the Sanctuary of the company of Your Saints;<br>
  I am worthless, and You are so benevolent. ||1||Pause||<br>
  You are the white and yellow threads of silk, and I am like a poor worm.<br>
  O Lord, I seek to live in the Company of the Saints, like the bee with its honey. ||2||<br>
  My social status is low, my ancestry is low, and my birth is low as well.<br>
  I have not performed the service of the Lord, the Lord, says Ravi Daas the cobbler. ||3||3||<br>
  Aasaa:<br>
  What would it matter, if my body were cut into pieces?<br>
  If I were to lose Your Love, Lord, then Your humble servant would be afraid. ||1||<br>
  Your lotus feet are the home of my mind.<br>
  Drinking in Your Nectar, I have obtained the wealth of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Prosperity, adversity, property and wealth are just Maya.<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 141</h2></center>
  Your humble servant is not engrossed in them. ||2||<br>
  Your humble servant is tied by the rope of Your Love.<br>
  Says Ravi Daas, what benefit would I get by escaping from it? ||3||4||<br>
  Aasaa:<br>
  The Lord, Har, Har, Har, Har, Har, Har, Haray.<br>
  Meditating on the Lord, the humble are carried across to salvation. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Through the Lord's Name, Kabeer became famous and respected.<br>
  The accounts of his past incarnations were torn up. ||1||<br>
  Because of Naam Dayv's devotion, the Lord drank the milk he offered.<br>
  He shall not have to suffer the pains of reincarnation into the world again. ||2||<br>
  Servant Ravi Daas is imbued with the Lord's Love.<br>
  By Guru's Grace, he shall not have to go to hell. ||3||5||<br>
  How does the puppet of clay dance?<br>
  He looks and listens, hears and speaks, and runs around. ||1||Pause||<br>
  When he acquires something, he is inflated with ego.<br>
  But when his wealth is gone, then he cries and bewails. ||1||<br>
  In thought, word and deed, he is attached to the sweet and tangy flavors.<br>
  When he dies, no one knows where he has gone. ||2||<br>
  Says Ravi Daas, the world is just a dramatic play, O Siblings of Destiny.<br>
  I have enshrined love for the Lord, the star of the show. ||3||6||<br>
  Aasaa, The Word Of Devotee Dhanna Jee:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  I wandered through countless incarnations, but mind, body and wealth never remain stable.<br>
  Attached to, and stained by the poisons of sexual desire and greed, the mind has forgotten the jewel of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<br>
  The poisonous fruit seems sweet to the demented mind, which does not know the difference between good and evil.<br>
  Turning away from virtue, his love for other things increases, and he weaves again the web of birth and death. ||1||<br>
  He does not know the way to the Lord, who dwells within his heart; burning in the trap, he is caught by the noose of death.<br>
  Gathering the poisonous fruits, he fills his mind with them, and he forgets God, the Supreme Being, from his mind. ||2||<br>
  The Guru has given the wealth of spiritual wisdom; practicing meditation, the mind becomes one with Him.<br>
  Embracing loving devotional worship for the Lord, I have come to know peace; satisfied and satiated, I have been liberated. ||3||<br>
  One who is filled with the Divine Light, recognizes the undeceivable Lord God.<br>
  Dhanna has obtained the Lord, the Sustainer of the World, as his wealth; meeting the humble Saints, he merges in the Lord. ||4||1||<br>
  Fifth Mehl:<br>
  Naam Dayv's mind was absorbed into God, Gobind, Gobind, Gobind.<br>
  The calico-printer, worth half a shell, became worth millions. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Abandoning weaving and stretching thread, Kabeer enshrined love for the Lord's lotus feet.<br>
  A weaver from a lowly family, he became an ocean of excellence. ||1||<br>
  Ravi Daas, who used to carry dead cows every day, renounced the world of Maya.<br>
  He became famous in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and obtained the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan. ||2||<br>
  Sain, the barber, the village drudge, became famous in each and every house.<br>
  The Supreme Lord God dwelled in his heart, and he was counted among the devotees. ||3||<br>
 <center><h2>Section 08 - Raag Aasaa - Part 142</h2></center>
  Hearing this, Dhanna the Jaat applied himself to devotional worship.<br>
  The Lord of the Universe met him personally; Dhanna was so very blessed. ||4||2||<br>
  O my consciousness, why don't you remain conscious of the Merciful Lord? How can you recognize any other?<br>
  You may run around the whole universe, but that alone happens which the Creator Lord does. ||1||Pause||<br>
  In the water of the mother's womb, He fashioned the body with ten gates.<br>
  He gives it sustenance, and preserves it in fire - such is my Lord and Master. ||1||<br>
  The mother turtle is in the water, and her babies are out of the water. She has no wings to protect them, and no milk to feed them.<br>
  The Perfect Lord, the embodiment of supreme bliss, the Fascinating Lord takes care of them. See this, and understand it in your mind||2||<br>
  The worm lies hidden under the stone - there is no way for him to escape.<br>
  Says Dhanna, the Perfect Lord takes care of him. Fear not, O my soul. ||3||3||<br>
  Aasaa, The Word Of Shaykh Fareed Jee:<br>
  One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<br>
  They alone are true, whose love for God is deep and heart-felt.<br>
  Those who have one thing in their heart, and something else in their mouth, are judged to be false. ||1||<br>
  Those who are imbued with love for the Lord, are delighted by His Vision.<br>
  Those who forget the Naam, the Name of the Lord, are a burden on the earth. ||1||Pause||<br>
  Those whom the Lord attaches to the hem of His robe, are the true dervishes at His Door.<br>
  Blessed are the mothers who gave birth to them, and fruitful is their coming into the world. ||2||<br>
  O Lord, Sustainer and Cherisher, You are infinite, unfathomable and endless.<br>
  Those who recognize the True Lord - I kiss their feet. ||3||<br>
  I seek Your Protection - You are the Forgiving Lord.<br>
  Please, bless Shaykh Fareed with the bounty of Your meditative worship. ||4||1||<br>
  Aasaa:<br>
  Says Shaykh Fareed, O my dear friend, attach yourself to the Lord.<br>
  This body shall turn to dust, and its home shall be a neglected graveyard. ||1||<br>
  You can meet the Lord today, O Shaykh Fareed, if you restrain your bird-like desires which keep your mind in turmoil. ||1||Pause||<br>
  If I had known that I was to die, and not return again,<br>
  I would not have ruined myself by clinging to the world of falsehood. ||2||<br>
  So speak the Truth, in righteousness, and do not speak falsehood.<br>
  The disciple ought to travel the route, pointed out by the Guru. ||3||<br>
  Seeing the youths being carried across, the hearts of the beautiful young soul-brides are encouraged.<br>
  Those who side with the glitter of gold, are cut down with a saw. ||4||<br>
  O Shaykh, no one's life is permanent in this world.<br>
  That seat, upon which we now sit - many others sat on it and have since departed. ||5||<br>
  As the swallows appear in the month of Katik, forest fires in the month of Chayt, and lightning in Saawan,<br>
  and as the bride's arms adorn her husband's neck in winter;||6||<br>
  Just so, the transitory human bodies pass away. Reflect upon this in your mind.<br>
  It takes six months to form the body, but it breaks in an instant. ||7||<br>
  O Fareed, the earth asks the sky, "Where have the boatmen gone?"<br>
