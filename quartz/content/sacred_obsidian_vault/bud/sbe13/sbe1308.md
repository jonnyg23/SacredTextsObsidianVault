This rule, directed against too great luxury in the matter of a perfectly finished dwelling, is somewhat obscure, owing to our want of information as to the mode in which such dwellings should be put up. It refers probably to a hut, albeit a large one, of wattel and daub (ku<i>dd</i>a: comp. Rh. D.'s note on the Mahâparinibbâna Sutta V, 41). The Samanta-Pâsâdikâ divides dvâra-kosa into dvâra-okâsa, and quotes various estimates from the old Sinhalese commentaries as to the proper extent of this space (see Minayeff, p. 87).</p>

The mode of procedure is laid down in the Vibha<u>n</u>ga as follows: 'The Bhikkhu asks the Bhikkhunî's, "Are you all present, sisters, and do none raise objections (that is, are you samaggâ)?" If they say, "That is so Sir!" he asks, "Are the eight Garu-dhammâ being kept up?" If they say, "They are, Sir!" he is to say, "That, sisters, is the exhortation! " and so deliver it to them. If they say, "They are not, Sir!" he should go all through them, saying, "A sister who has been received into the higher grade even one hundred years, &amp;c.

 <p>'If he preach any other Dhamma to those who say. "We, Sir, are all present, and none raise objections!" he is guilty of a Dukka<i>t</i>a. If he preach the eight Garu-dhammâ to those who say, "No, Sir; that is not so!" (vagg'amh' ayyâ ti. where vagga is vyagra, the opposite of samagga), he is guilty of a Dukka<i>t</i>a. If he preach another Dhamma, when the eight Garu-dhammâ have not committed to their charge, he is guilty of a Dukka<i>t</i>a.</p>

A kulupikâ bhikkhuhî then arrives, and says, 'My friends, give the gentleman a meal!' Then the Bhikkhu was in doubt whether he ought not to refuse it as being Bhikkhunî-paripâ<i>k</i>ita<i>m</i>.</p>

An âvasatha is one of those 'chaultries,' or public resting-places, which good Buddhists were wont to put up in the villages or at cross roads.

 <p><a name="page_41_note_1"></a><a href="#page_41_fr_1">1</a> These are the various non-Buddhist religious teachers or devotees, most of whom rejected the Vedas. The Paribbâ<i>g</i>akas were mostly, though not always, wandering logicians, willing to maintain theses against all the world. Paribbâ<i>g</i>ikâ is merely the feminine of the last. A<i>k</i>elaka, which naturally has no feminine, were the naked ascetics.</p>
 
 <p>The sect now called <i>G</i>ains are divided into two classes, Svetambaras and Digambaras, the latter of which eat naked. They are known to be the successors of the school called Niga<i>nth</i>as in the Pâli Pi<i>t</i>akas; and it is not certain whether the Niga<i>nth</i>as are included in the A<i>k</i>elakas. It is probable that the Brâhman ascetics, the Vânaprasthas, were not included under the term Paribbâ<i>g</i>akas; but our information on the exact meaning of these terms is, as yet, very imperfect.</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_41_note_2"></a><a href="#page_41_fr_2">2</a> That is merely to get rid of him, in order to gain any purpose of his own. The Vibha<u>n</u>ga gives as examples that the Bhikkhu sees some valuable things, and wants to get them; or sees some woman, and wants to speak to her.</p>

The Old Commentary says, 'A sabho<i>g</i>ana kula is one where there is a husband and a wife; and they both, husband and wife, are not gone forth from, are not devoid of lust' (Minayeff, p. 89, under P.; but for anatikkantâ read anikkhantâ). Then the Samanta-Pâsâdikâ, doubtless to justify this suggested implication, makes sabhogana<i>m</i> equal to saha ubhohi <i>g</i>anehi (!); or, in the alternative, to sabhoga<i>m</i>, since 'the wife is the bhoga of a man still given to passion, and the husband the bhoga of a wife.' The use of Bho<i>g</i>ana in any such sense is extremely forced, and was perhaps only suggested by the following rules; but it is just possible we should translate, 'a household still given to pleasure' (compare <i>K</i>ullavagga VIII, 5, 1), or 'fond of good food' (compare Milinda Pañha 76).</p>

 <p><a name="page_42_note_2"></a><a href="#page_42_fr_2">2</a> The Vibha<u>n</u>ga has the following stories in regard to these two particulars. A family devated to Upananda invited him and another Bhikkhu. Before meal-time he went to attend on other families (purebhatta<i>m</i> kulâni payirupâsati). The people delayed giving his meal to the other Bhikkhu till Upananda should arrive. He came late; and the other Bhikkhu was thereby discomforted.</p>
 
 <p>The family devoted to Upananda sent him food for his use; saying it was to be given to the Sa<i>m</i>gha, with special reference to him. He had gone for an alms to the village. The messengers delivered the food and the message, and asked where Upananda was. The Bhikkhus told the matter to the Blessed One. He directed the present to be accepted, and laid by till Upananda should return. After Upananda returned, he nevertheless went out again to attend on other families, and the food so sent went bad.</p>
 
 <p>The Bhikkhu is to tell a resident Bhikkhu before, on account of this rule, giving up his usual rounds, in order that he may still go if a sick Bhikkhu wants medicine.</p>

The former is the better reading; nîhata is impossible, it must be either nihata or nîha<i>t</i>a. But ratanaka, though the queen is one of the seven Ratanas of a king, is not found elsewhere used absolutely for a queen: the use of râ<i>g</i>ake, too, immediately after ra<i>ññ</i>o, instead of ra<i>ññ</i>e or râ<i>g</i>ini, is curious.

There is no reason whatever to believe that Gotama's robe was larger, in proportion, than those worn by the other members of his order. He exchanged robes with Mahâ Kassapa. Of the two sets of robes brought by Pukkusa, one was given to Ânanda, and one was reserved for the Buddha himself; and no one can read the account in the Mahâ-parinibbâna Sutta without feeling that both are supposed to be of the same size.</p>
