 <p>   "What do you say to this, your majesty? When you were a young, tender, weakly infant lying on your back, was that your present grown-up self?"</p>
 
 <p>   "Nay, verily, bhante. The young, tender, weakly infant lying on its back was one person, and my present grown-up self is another person."</p>
 
 <p>   "If that is the case, your majesty, there can be no such thing as a mother, or a father, or a teacher, or an educated man, or a righteous man, or a wise man.

 <p>   "In exactly the same way, your majesty, do the elements of being join one another in serial succession: one element perishes, another arises, succeeding each other as it were instantaneously.

 <p>   Strictly speaking, the duration of the life of a living being is exceedingly brief, lasting only while a thought lasts. Just as a chariot-wheel in rolling rolls only at one point of the tire, and in resting rests only at one point; in exactly the same way, the life of a living being lasts only for the period of one thought. As soon as that thought has ceased the being is said to have ceased. As it has been said:--</p>
 
 <p>   "The being of a past moment of thought has lived, but does not live, nor will it live.</p>
 
 <p>   "The being of a future moment of thought will live, but has not lived, nor does it live.</p>
 
 <p>   "The being of the present moment of thought does live, but has not lived, nor will it live."</p>
