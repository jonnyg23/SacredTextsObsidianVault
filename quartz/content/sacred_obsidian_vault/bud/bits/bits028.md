 <p>   O priests, consciousness is named from that in dependence on which it comes into being. The consciousness which comes into being in respect of forms in dependence on the eye is called eye-consciousness. The consciousness which comes into being in respect of sounds in dependence on the ear is called ear-consciousness. The consciousness which comes into being in respect of odors in dependence on the nose is called nose-consciousness. The consciousness which comes into being in respect of tastes in dependence on the tongue is called tongue-consciousness. The consciousness which comes into being in respect of things tangible in dependence on the body is called body-consciousness. The consciousness which comes into being in respect of ideas in dependence on the mind is called mind-consciousness.</p>
 
 <p>   Just as, O priests, fire is named from that in dependence on which it burns. The fire which burns in dependence on logs of wood is called a log-fire. The fire which burns in dependence on chips is called a chip-fire. The fire which burns in dependence on grass is called a grass-fire. The fire which burns in dependence on cow-dung is called a cow-dung fire. The fire which burns in dependence on husks is called a husk-fire. The fire which burns in dependence on rubbish is called a rubbish-fire. In exactly the same way, O priests, consciousness is named from that in dependence on which it comes into being. The consciousness which comes into being in respect of forms in dependence on the eye is called eye. consciousness.

 <p>   In the proposition, <i>On karma depends consciousness</i>, consciousness is sixfold, eye-consciousness etc.</p>
 
 <p>   Here eye-consciousness is twofold, being either a meritorious or a demeritorious fruition--likewise ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness, and body-consciousness. Mind-consciousness is the two minds, namely, the meritorious fruition-mind as well as the demeritorious fruition-mind, the three mind-consciousnesses without a cause, the eight fruition-thoughts belonging to the realm of sensual pleasure and possessing a cause, the five thoughts belonging to the realm of form, and the four belonging to the realm of formlessness, making twenty-two divisions. Thus in the six consciousnesses are included all the thirty-two worldly fruition-consciousnesses. The consciousnesses, however, which transcend the world are not included as they are not pertinent in a discussion of rebirth.</p>
