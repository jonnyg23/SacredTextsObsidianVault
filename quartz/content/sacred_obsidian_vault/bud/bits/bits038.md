 <h4></h4><p align="center">§ 38. BE A FRIEND TO YOURSELF.</p>
 
 <p align="center"><small>Translated from the Samyutta-Nikâya (iii.1.4<sup>1</sup>).</small></p>
 
 <p>   Thus have I heard.</p>
 
 <p>   On a certain occasion The Blessed One was dwelling at Sâvatthi, in Jetavana monastery in Anâthapindika's Park.</p>
 
 <p>   Then drew near king Pasenadi the Kosalan to where The Blessed One was; and having drawn near and greeted The Blessed One, he sat down respectfully at one side. And seated respectfully at one side, king Pasenadi the Kosalan spoke to The Blessed One as follows:--</p>
 
 <p>   "Reverend Sir, it happened to me, as I was just now in seclusion and plunged in meditation, that a consideration presented itself to my mind, as follows: 'Who are those who love themselves? and who do not love themselves?' And, Reverend Sir, it occurred to me as follows: 'All they who do evil with their body, who do evil with their voice, who do evil with their mind, they do not love themselves.' And although they should say thus: 'We love ourselves,' nevertheless, they do not love themselves. And why do I say so? Because, whatever a man would do to one whom he did not love, that they do to themselves. Therefore, they do not love themselves.</p>

Because, whatever a man would do to one whom he loved, that they do to themselves. Therefore, they love themselves."</p>
 
 <p>   "Thus it is, great king! Thus it is! Certainly, great king, all they who do evil with their body, who do evil with their voice, who do evil with their mind, they do not love themselves. And although they should say thus: 'We love ourselves,' nevertheless, they do not love themselves. And why do I say so? Because, whatever a man would do to one</p>
