 <p>
 The connection between Christianity and Buddhism is unmistakable, both
 in terms of the traditional narratives of the respective founders, and in their
 parable-riddled attributed sayings.
 Some, particularly occultists, have attempted to
 explain this by proposing a residence in India
 by Jesus during his 'lost years,' for instance,
 <a href="../../chr/uljc/index.htm">Notovich</a>,
 and the derivative work by <a href="../../chr/agjc/index.htm">Dowling</a>.
 Arthur Lillie here examines possible historical
 linkages between the two religions from a critical, rationalist, viewpoint.
 </p>
 <p>
 His theory will be thought-provoking for Buddhists and Christians alike.
 Lillie explores some of the same issues which John Robertson targets in
 <a href="../../bib/cv/pch/index.htm">Pagan Christs</a>, particularly the
 evolution of sacrificial rites into symbolic forms.
 He is not a believer in the historicity of either Jesus or Buddha,
 and he pokes a lot of holes in the normative chronology of Buddhism.
 Lillie is also trying to open up an additional front here, by attempting
 to reduce much of Indian mythology to a multiplication of forms of Shiva.
 This is a radical view which blurs some of the efficacy of this book.
 He also, curiously enough, ignores the parallels between the
 Christ and Krishna stories, which many others have remarked on.
 </p>
 <p>
 On the whole, this controversial thesis is an enjoyable read, and a rare
 attempt by a free-thinker to confront the issue of diffusion of religious
 concepts from India to the Near East.

 <p>PRODUCTION NOTES:
 There were a lot of <a href="errata.htm">typographical errors</a>
 in this book, which I corrected in the usual fashion.
 Spelling of non-English terms was highly inconsistent;
 and I was careful to transcribe each variant as it appeared, even
 if I knew it to be incorrect.
 Lastly, there is what appears to be a lacuna of several paragraphs at pages
 <a href="ipc17.htm#page_231">231</a> and
 <a href="ipc17.htm#page_232">232</a>; a
 numbered list of astrological signs starts at the latter page with the number 3.
 I have no explanation for this.<i>--J.B. Hare, February 26, 2008</i>.
