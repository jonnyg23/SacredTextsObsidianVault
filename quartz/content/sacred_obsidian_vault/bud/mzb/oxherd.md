 <h1 align="CENTER">The Ten Oxherding Pictures</h1>
 <h2 align="CENTER">From The Manual of Zen Buddhism, D.T. Suzuki</h2>
 <h3 align="CENTER">By Shubun (15th Century)</h3>

 <h4 align="CENTER">1. Undisciplined</h4>
 <p align="CENTER">With his horns fiercely projected in the air the beast snorts,<br>
 Madly running over the mountain paths, farther and farther he goes astray!<br>
 A dark cloud is spread across the entrance of the valley,<br>
 And who knows how much of the fine fresh herb is trampled under his wild hoofs!</p>
 <p align="CENTER"><a name="img_bull02"></a>
 <img src="img/bull02.jpg"> </p>
 <h4 align="CENTER">2. Discipline Begun</h4>
 <p align="CENTER">I am in possession of a straw rope, and I pass it through his nose,<br>
 For once he makes a frantic attempt to run away, but he is severely whipped and whipped;<br>
 The beast resists the training with all the power there is in a nature wild and ungoverned,<br>
 But the rustic oxherd never relaxes his pulling tether and ever-ready whip.</p>
 <p align="CENTER"><a name="img_bull03"></a>

 <h4 align="CENTER">3. In Harness</h4>
 <p align="CENTER">Gradually getting into harness the beast is now content to be led by the nose,<br>
 Crossing the stream, walking along the mountain path, he follows every step of the leader;<br>
 The leader holds the rope tightly in his hand never letting it go,<br>
 All day long he is on the alert almost unconscious of what fatigue is.</p>
 <p align="CENTER"><a name="img_bull04"></a>
 <img src="img/bull04.jpg"> </p>
 <h4 align="CENTER">4. Faced Round</h4>
 <p align="CENTER">After long days of training the result begins to tell and the beast is faced round,<br>
 A nature so wild and ungoverned is finally broken, he has become gentler;<br>
 But the tender has not yet given him his full confidence,<br>
 He still keeps his straw rope with which the ox is now tied to a tree.</p>
 <p align="CENTER"><a name="img_bull05"></a>
 <img src="img/bull05.jpg"> </p>
 <h4 align="CENTER">5. Tamed</h4>
 <p align="CENTER">Under the green willow tree and by the ancient mountain stream,<br>
 The ox is set at liberty to pursue his own pleasures;<br>
 At the eventide when a grey mist descends on the pasture,<br>
 The boy wends his homeward way with the animal quietly following.</p>
 <p align="CENTER"><a name="img_bull06"></a>
 <img src="img/bull06.jpg"> </p>
 <h4 align="CENTER">6. Unimpeded</h4>
 <p align="CENTER">On the verdant field the beast contentedly lies idling his time away,<br>
 No whip is needed now, nor any kind of restraint;<br>
 The boy too sits leisurely under the pine tree,<br>
 Playing a tune of peace, overflowing with joy.</p>
 <p align="CENTER"><a name="img_bull07"></a>
 <img src="img/bull07.jpg"> </p>
 <h4 align="CENTER">7. Laissez Faire</h4>
 <p align="CENTER">The spring stream in the evening sun flows languidly along the willow-lined bank,<br>
 In the hazy atmosphere the meadow grass is seen growing thick;<br>
 When hungry he grazes, when thirsty he quaffs, as time sweetly slides,<br>
 While the boy on the rock dozes for hours not noticing anything that goes on about him.</p>
 <p align="CENTER"><a name="img_bull08"></a>
 <img src="img/bull08.jpg"> </p>
 <h4 align="CENTER">8. All Forgotten</h4>
 <p align="CENTER">The beast all in white now is surrounded by the white clouds,<br>
 The man is perfectly at his ease and care-free, so is his companion;<br>
 The white clouds penetrated by the moon-light cast their white shadows below,<br>
 The white clouds and the bright moon-light-each following its course of movement.</p>
 <p align="CENTER"><a name="img_bull09"></a>
 <img src="img/bull09.jpg"> </p>
 <h4 align="CENTER">9. The Solitary Moon</h4>
 <p align="CENTER">Nowhere is the beast, and the oxherd is master of his time,<br>
 He is a solitary cloud wafting lightly along the mountain peaks;<br>
 Clapping his hands he sings joyfully in the moon-light,<br>
 But remember a last wall is still left barring his homeward walk.</p>
 <p align="CENTER"><a name="img_bull10"></a>
 <img src="img/bull10.jpg"> </p>
 <h4 align="CENTER">10. Both Vanished</h4>
 <p align="CENTER">Both the man and the animal have disappeared, no traces are left,<br>
 The bright moon-light is empty and shadowless with all the ten-thousand objects in it;<br>
 If anyone should ask the meaning of this,<br>
 Behold the lilies of the field and its fresh sweet-scented verdure.</p>
