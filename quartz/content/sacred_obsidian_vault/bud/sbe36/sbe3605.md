 THE OBSTACLES.]</p>
 <p>1. 'Venerable Nâgasena, the Blessed One said:</p>
 <p>"Live, O brethren, devoted to and taking delight in that which has no Papa<i>ñk</i>as (none of those states of mind which delay or obstruct a man in his spiritual growth <a name="fr_232"></a><a href="#fn_230"><font size="1">1</font></a>)."</p>
 <p>'What is that which has no Papa<i>ñk</i>as?'</p>
 <p>'The fruit of Conversion has no Papa<i>ñk</i>as, O king, the fruit of that stage of the Path in which those live who will be only once, or not all reborn, the fruit of Arahatship has no Papa<i>ñk</i>as.'</p>
 <p>'But if that be so, Nâgasena, [<b>263</b>] then why do the brethren concern themselves with recitation of, with asking questions about the discourses, and the pieces in mixed prose and verse, and the expositions, and the poems, and the outbursts of emotion, and the passages beginning "Thus he said," and the birth-stories, and the tales of wonder, and the extended treatises <a name="fr_233"></a><a href="#fn_231"><font size="1">2</font></a>? Why do they trouble themselves about new buildings <a name="fr_234"></a><a href="#fn_232"><font size="1">3</font></a> about gifts and offerings to the order?'</p>
 <p>

 <p>2. 'They who do all these things, O king, are working towards attainment of freedom from the Papa<i>ñk</i>as, (that is of Arahatship <a name="fr_235"></a><a href="#fn_233"><font size="1">1</font></a>). For whereas, O king, all those of the brethren who are pure by nature, those upon whose hearts an impression has been left by good deeds done in a former birth <a name="fr_236"></a><a href="#fn_234"><font size="1">2</font></a>, can (get rid of the Papa<i>ñk</i>as, can) become Arahats, in a moment--those on the other hand whose minds are much darkened by evil <a name="fr_237"></a><a href="#fn_235"><font size="1">3</font></a> can only become Arahats by such means as these.</p>
 <p>3. 'Just, O king, as while one man who has sown a field and got the seed to grow can, by the exertion of his own power, and without any rampart or fence, reap the crop--whereas another man when he has got the seed to grow must go into the woods, and cut down sticks and branches and make a fence of them, and thus only reap the crop--in the same way those who are pure by nature, upon whose hearts an impression has been left by good deeds done in a former birth, can, in a moment, become Arahats, like the man who gathers the crop without a fence. But those, on the other hand, whose minds are darkened by the evil they have done can only become Arahats by such means as these--like the man who can only reap his crop if he builds the fence.</p>
 <p>4. 'Or just, O king, as there might be a bunch of fruits on the summit of a lofty mango tree. Then</p>

 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_94"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 94</font></a></p>
 <p>whoever possesses the power of Iddhi could take those fruits <a name="fr_238"></a><a href="#fn_236"><font size="1">1</font></a>, but whoever had not, he would have first to cut sticks and creepers and construct a ladder, and by its means climb up the tree and so get at the fruit. In the same way those who are by nature pure, and upon whose hearts an impression has been left by good deeds done in a former birth, may attain, in a moment, to Arahatship, like the man getting the fruit by the power of Iddhi. But those, on the other hand, whose minds are darkened by the evil they have done can only become Arahats by such means as these, like the man who only gets the fruit by means of the ladder he has made.</p>
 <p>5. [<b>264</b>] 'Or just, O king, as while one man who is clever in business will go alone to his lord and conclude any business he has to do, another man, rich though he may be, must by his riches bring others to his service, and by their help get the business done--and it is for the business' sake that he has to seek after them. In the same way those who are by nature pure, upon whose hearts an impression has been left by good deeds done in a former birth, may reach, in a moment, to the attainment of the Six Transcendent Qualities <a name="fr_239"></a><a href="#fn_237"><font size="1">2</font></a>, like the man who does the business alone by himself Whereas those brethren whose minds are darkened by the evil they have done can only by such means as these realise the gains of renunciation, like the man who through others' help brings his business to the desired end.</p>

 <p>6. 'For recitation is of great good, O king, and asking questions, and superintending building work, and seeing to gifts and offerings is of great good--each of them to one or other of the spiritual objects which the brethren seek to obtain. just, O king, as there might be some one of the ministers or soldiers or messengers or sentries or body-guards or attendants who was especially serviceable and useful to the king, but when he had any business given him to do they would all help him--just so are all these things of assistance when those objects have to be attained. When all men, O king, shall have become by nature pure, then will there be nothing left for a teacher <a name="fr_240"></a><a href="#fn_238"><font size="1">1</font></a> to accomplish. But so long as there is still need of discipleship <a name="fr_241"></a><a href="#fn_239"><font size="1">2</font></a>, so long will even such a man, O king, as the Elder Sâriputta himself (though he had attained to the summit of wisdom by reason of his having been, through countless ages, deeply rooted in merit), yet find it impossible, without discipleship, to attain to Arahatship <a name="fr_242"></a><a href="#fn_240"><font size="1">3</font></a>. Therefore is it, O king, that hearing (the Scriptures) is of use, and recitation of them, and asking questions about them. And therefore is it that those also who are addicted to</p>

 <p>these things, becoming free from the obstacles thereto, attain to Arahatship <a name="fr_243"></a><a href="#fn_241"><font size="1">1</font></a>.'</p>
 <p>'Right well have you made me understand this puzzle, Nâgasena. That is so, and I accept it as you say.</p>

 THE LAY ARAHAT.]</p>
 <p>7. 'Venerable Nâgasena, your people say:</p>
 <p>"Whosoever has attained, as a layman, to Arahatship, one of two conditions are possible to him, and no other--either that very day he enters the Order, or he dies away, for beyond that day he cannot last <a name="fr_244"></a><a href="#fn_242"><font size="1">2</font></a>."</p>
 <p>[<b>265</b>] 'Now if, Nâgasena, he could not, on that day, procure a teacher or preceptor, or a bowl and set of robes <a name="fr_245"></a><a href="#fn_243"><font size="1">3</font></a>, would he then, being an Arahat, admit himself, or would he live over the day, or would some other Arahat suddenly appear by the power of Iddhi and admit him, or would he die away?'</p>
 <p>'He could not, O king, because he is an Arahat, admit himself. For any one admitting himself to</p>

 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_97"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 97</font></a></p>
 <p>the Order is guilty of theft <a name="fr_246"></a><a href="#fn_244"><font size="1">1</font></a>. And he could not last beyond that day. Whether another Arahat should happen, or not, to arrive, on that very day would he die away.'</p>
 <p>'Then, Nâgasena, by whatever means attained, the holy condition of Arahatship is thereby also lost, for destruction of life is involved in it.'</p>
 <p>8. 'It is the condition of laymanship which is at fault, O king. In that faulty condition, and by reason of the weakness of the condition itself, the layman who, as such, has attained to Arahatship must either, that very day, enter the Order or die away. That is not the fault of Arahatship, O king. It is laymanship that is at fault, through not being strong enough.</p>
 <p>'Just, O king, as food, that guards the growth and protects the life of all beings, will, through indigestion, take away the life of one whose stomach is unequal to it, whose internal fire is low and weak--just so if a layman attains Arahatship when in that condition unequal to it, then by reason of the weakness of the condition he must, that very day, either enter the Order or die away.</p>
 <p>'Or just, O king, as a tiny blade of grass when a heavy rock is placed upon it will, through its weakness, break off and give way--just so when a layman attains Arahatship, then, unable to support Arahatship in that condition, he must, that very day, either enter the Order or die away.</p>
 <p>'Or just, O king, as a poor weak fellow of low birth and little ability, if he came into possession of</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_98"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 98</font></a></p>
 <p>a great and mighty kingdom, would be unable to support the dignity of it <a name="fr_247"></a><a href="#fn_245"><font size="1">1</font></a>--just so if a layman attains to Arahatship, then is he unable, in that condition, to support it. [266] And that is the reason why he must, on that very day, either enter the Order or die away.'</p>
 <p>'Very good, Nâgasena! That is so, and I accept it as you say.'</p>

 THE FAULTS OF THE ARAHAT.]</p>
 <p>9. 'Venerable Nâgasena, can an Arahat be thoughtless <a name="fr_248"></a><a href="#fn_246"><font size="1">2</font></a>?'</p>
 <p>'The Arahats, O king, have put thoughtlessness far from them. They are never inadvertent.'</p>
 <p>'But can an Arahat be guilty of an offence?'</p>
 <p>'Yes, O king.'</p>
 <p>'In what respect?'</p>
 <p>'In the construction of his cell <a name="fr_249"></a><a href="#fn_247"><font size="1">3</font></a>, or in his intercourse (with the other sex) <a name="fr_250"></a><a href="#fn_248"><font size="1">4</font></a>, or in imagining the wrong time (for the midday meal) to be the right</p>

 <p>time <a name="fr_251"></a><a href="#fn_249"><font size="1">1</font></a>, or when he has been invited (to a meal <a name="fr_252"></a><a href="#fn_250"><font size="1">2</font></a>) forgetting the invitation, or in taking to be "left over <a name="fr_253"></a><a href="#fn_251"><font size="1">3</font></a>" food which has not been left over.'</p>
 <p>'But, venerable Nâgasena, your people say:</p>
 <p>"Those who commit offences do so from one of two reasons, either out of carelessness or out of ignorance <a name="fr_254"></a><a href="#fn_252"><font size="1">4</font></a>."</p>
 <p>'Now, is the Arahat careless that he commits offences?'</p>
 <p>'No, O king.'</p>
 <p>'Then if the Arahat commits offences, and yet is not careless, he must be capable of thoughtlessness.'</p>
 <p>'He is not capable of thoughtlessness, and yet the Arahat may be guilty of offences.'</p>
 <p>'Convince me then by a reason. What is the reason of this?'</p>
 <p>10. 'There are two kinds of sins, O king--those which are a breach of the ordinary moral law, and those which are a breach of the Rules (of the Order). And what is a breach of the ordinary moral law? The ten modes of evil action <a name="fr_255"></a><a href="#fn_253"><font size="1">5</font></a> (killing, theft,</p>

 </p>
 <p>

 <p>
 </p>

 </p>
 <p><a name="page_100"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 100</font></a></p>
 <p>unchastity, lying, slander, harsh language, frivolous talk, covetousness, malice, and false doctrine). These things are against the moral law. And what is a breach of the Rules? Whatever is held in the world as unfitting and improper for Samanas, but is not wrong for laymen--things concerning which the Blessed One laid down rules for his disciples, not to be transgressed by them their lives long. Eating after sunturn, O king, is not wrong to those in the world, but is wrong to those in the religion (the Order) of the Conquerors. Doing injury to trees and shrubs is no offence in the eyes of the world, but it is wrong in the religion. The habit of sporting in the water is no offence to a layman, but it is wrong in the religion. And many other things of a similar kind, O king, are right in the world, but wrong in the religion of the Conquerors. This is what I mean by a breach of the Rules. Now the Arahat (he in whom the Great Evils are destroyed) is incapable of sinning against whatever is moral law, but he may unawares be guilty of an offence against the rules of the Order. [<b>267</b>] It is not within the province of every Arahat to know everything, nor indeed in his power. He may be ignorant of the personal or family name of some woman or some man. He may be ignorant of some road over the earth. But every Arahat would know about emancipation, and the Arahat gifted with the six modes of transcendental knowledge <a name="fr_256"></a><a href="#fn_254"><font size="1">1</font></a> would know what lies within their scope, and an omniscient Tathâgata, O king, would know all things.'</p>

'Venerable Nâgasena, there are found beings in the world who have come into existence through Karma, and others who are the result of a cause, and others produced by the seasons <a name="fr_263"></a><a href="#fn_261"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Tell me--is there any thing that does not fall under any one of these three heads?'</p>
 <p>' There are two such things, O king. And what are the two? Space, O king, and Nirvâ<i>n</i>a.'</p>
 <p>'Now do not spoil the word of the Conquerors, Nâgasena, nor answer a question without knowing what you say!'</p>
 <p>'What, pray, is it I have said, O king, that you should address me thus?'</p>
 <p>'Venerable Nâgasena, that is right what you said in respect of space. But with hundreds of reasons</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_104"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 104</font></a></p>
 <p>did the Blessed One proclaim to his disciples the way to the realisation of Nirvâ<i>n</i>a. And yet you say that Nirvâ<i>n</i>a is not the result of any cause!'</p>
 <p>'No doubt, O king, the Blessed One gave hundreds of reasons for our entering on the way to the realisation of Nirvâ<i>n</i>a. But he never told us of a cause out of which Nirvâ<i>n</i>a could be said to be produced.'</p>
 <p>14. 'Now in this, Nâgasena, we have passed from darkness into greater darkness, [<b>269</b>] from a jungle into a denser jungle, from a thicket into a deeper thicket--inasmuch as you say there is a cause for the realisation of Nirvâ<i>n</i>a, but no cause from which it can arise. If, Nâgasena, there be a cause of the realisation of Nirvâ<i>n</i>a, then we must expect to find a cause of the origin of Nirvâ<i>n</i>a. just, Nâgasena, as because the son has a father, therefore we ought to expect that that father had a father--or because the pupil has a teacher, therefore we ought to expect that the teacher had a teacher--or because the plant came from a seed, therefore we ought to expect that the seed too had come from a seed <a name="fr_264"></a><a href="#fn_262"><font size="1">1</font></a>--just so, Nâgasena, if there be a reason for the realisation of Nirvâ<i>n</i>a, we ought to expect that there is a reason too for its origin,--just as if we saw the top of a tree, or of a creeper, we should conclude that it had a middle part, and a root.'</p>
 <p>'Nirvâ<i>n</i>a, O king, is unproduceable, and no cause for its origin has been declared.'</p>
 <p>'Come now, Nâgasena, give me a reason for this. Convince me by argument, so that I may know how</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_105"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 105</font></a></p>
 <p>it is that while there is a cause that will bring about the realisation of Nirvâ<i>n</i>a, there is no cause that will bring about Nirvâ<i>n</i>a itself.'</p>
 <p>15. 'Then, O king, give ear attentively, and listen well, and I will tell you what the reason is. Could a man, O king, by his ordinary power, go up from hence to the Himâlaya, the king of mountains?'</p>
 <p>'Yes, Sir, he could.'</p>
 <p>'But could a man, by his ordinary power, bring the Himâlaya mountains here?'</p>
 <p>'Certainly not, Sir.'</p>
 <p>'Well! therefore is it that while a cause for the realisation of Nirvâ<i>n</i>a can be declared, the cause of its origin can not. And could a man, O king, by his ordinary power cross over the great ocean in a ship, and so go to the further shore of it?'</p>
 <p>'Yes, Sir, he could.'</p>
 <p>'But could a man [<b>270</b>] by his ordinary power bring the further shore of the ocean here?'</p>
 <p>'Certainly not, Sir.'</p>
 <p>'Well! so is it that while a cause for the realisation of Nirvâ<i>n</i>a can be declared, the cause of its origin can not. And why not? Because Nirvâ<i>n</i>a is not put together of any qualities.'</p>
 <p>16. 'What, Sir! is it not put together?'</p>
 <p>'No, O king. It is uncompounded, not made of anything. Of Nirvâ<i>n</i>a, O king, it cannot be said that it has been produced, or not been produced, or that it can be produced <a name="fr_265"></a><a href="#fn_263"><font size="1">1</font></a>, that it is past or future or present, that it is perceptible by the eye or the ear or the nose or the tongue, or by the sense of touch.'</p>

 <p>'Is there such a thing, O king, as wind?'</p>
 <p>'Yes, of course.'</p>
 <p>'Show it me then, I pray you, O king--whether by its colour, or its form, whether as thin or thick, or short or long!'</p>
 <p>'But wind, Nâgasena, cannot be pointed out in that way <a name="fr_269"></a><a href="#fn_267"><font size="1">4</font></a>. It is not of such a nature that it can be taken into the hand or squeezed. But it exists all the same.'</p>

 <p>'All beings, O king, who are conscious, are Karma-born (spring into existence as the result of Karma). Fire, and all things growing out of seeds, are cause-born (the result of a pre-existing material cause).

Why then did not the Tathâgata, who was omniscient, and who knew by his insight of a Buddha what would happen in the future, determining in advance that for such and such an occasion such and such a rule would be required, lay down the whole code of rules at once; instead of laying them down to his disciples from time to time as each occasion arose, when the disgrace (of the wrong act) had been already noised abroad, when the evil was already wide spread and grown great, when the people were already filled with indignation <a name="fr_278"></a><a href="#fn_276"><font size="1">1</font></a>?'</p>

'The Tathâgata, O king, knew very well that in fulness of time the whole of the hundred and fifty Rules <a name="fr_279"></a><a href="#fn_277"><font size="1">2</font></a> would have to be laid down to those men. But the Tathâgata, O king, thought thus: "If I were to lay down the whole of the hundred and fifty Rules at once the people would be filled with fear [<b>273</b>], those of them who were willing to enter the Order would refrain from doing so, saying, 'How much is there here to be observed! how difficult a thing is it to enter religion according to the system of the Sama<i>n</i>a Gotama'--they would not trust my words, and through their want of faith they would be liable to rebirth in states of woe. As occasion arises therefore, illustrating it with a religious discourse, will I lay down, when the evil has become manifest, each Rule."'</p>

Both of these curt summaries of the deepest Buddhist doctrine were probably as ambiguous to him as they are to us. The literal translation of the phrase here would be, 'In the highest sense there is no acquisition of a being.'

In another passage below, IV, 8, 65 (p. 317 of the Pâli), this same word anupavi<i>tth</i>a<i>m</i> recurs in a clause the sense of which is doubtful; and there Hîna<i>t</i>i-kumburê explains it quite differently.

 <p><a name="fn_289"></a><a href="sbe3605.htm#fr_291">113:3</a> There is great uncertainty at present as to the views held, first in the Pi<i>t</i>akas and later in the Commentaries, regarding the calculation of time and the division of years into months and seasons. Our author here seems to regard the year as divided into two seasons only, Hemanta and Gimha. But Hemanta is usually supposed to last only from the 1st November (that is the middle of Kattika) to the beginning of March (that is the middle of Phagguni), Gimhâna for the next four months (March 1st--June 30th), and Vassâna the remaining four (July-October)--the year being thus divided into three equal cold. hot, and rainy seasons. At Mahâvagga VIII, 24, 3 there is a division of the year into unequal dry and wet seasons (utu and vassâna), and at <i>G</i>âtaka I, 86 it is said that vasanta-samayo begins when hemanta ends at the full moon of Phagguni. As our author places the characteristic events of the rainy season in the hot season, he cannot have had the division into three seasons in his mind.</p>
