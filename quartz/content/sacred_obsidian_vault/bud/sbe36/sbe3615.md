 <p>'Just, O king, as the waterpot when it is full gives forth no sound; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, even when he has reached the summit of Sama<i>n</i>aship, and knows all tradition and learning and interpretation, yet should give forth no sound, not pride himself thereon, not show himself puffed up, but putting away pride and self-righteousness, should be straightforward, not garrulous of himself, neither deprecating others. This, O king, is the quality of the waterpot he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all gods, in the Sutta Nipâta:</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"What is not full, that is the thing that sounds,<br>
 That which is full is noiseless and at rest;<br>

 <p><a name="page_370"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 370</font></a></p>
 <p>his arrows, plants both his feet firmly on the ground, keeps his knees straight, hangs his quiver against the narrow part of his waist, keeps his whole body steady, places both his hands firmly on the point of junction (of the arrow on the bow), closes his fists, leaves no openings between his fingers, stretches out his neck, shuts his mouth and one eye <a name="fr_861"></a><a href="#fn_851"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and takes aim <a name="fr_862"></a><a href="#fn_852"><font size="1">2</font></a> in joy at the thought: "I shall hit it <a name="fr_863"></a><a href="#fn_853"><font size="1">3</font></a>;" just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, plant firmly the feet of his zeal on the basis of righteousness, keep intact his kindness and tenderness of heart, fix his mind on subjugation of the senses, keep himself steady by self-restraint and performance of duty, suppress excitement and sense of faintness, by continual thoughtfulness let no openings remain in his mind, reach forward in zeal, shut the six doors (of the five senses and the mind), and continue mindful and thoughtful in joy at the thought: "By the javelin of my knowledge will I slay all my evil dispositions." This, O king, is the first of the qualities of the archer he ought to have.</p>

 <p>uneven arrows; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, carry about with him, so long as he is in the body, the vice of mindfulness and thoughtfulness, wherewith he may straighten out any crooked and bent and shifty ideas. This, O king, is the second of the qualities of the archer he ought to have.</p>
 <p>17. 'And again, O king, as the archer practises <a name="fr_866"></a><a href="#fn_856"><font size="1">1</font></a> at a target; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, practise, so long as he is in the body. And how, O king, should he practise? He should practise himself in the idea of the impermanence of all things, of the sorrow inherent in individuality, in the absence in any thing or creature of any abiding principle (any soul); in the ideas of the diseases, sores, pains, aches, and ailments of the body that follow in the train of the necessary conditions of individuality; in the ideas of its dependence on others <a name="fr_867"></a><a href="#fn_857"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and of its certain disintegration <a name="fr_868"></a><a href="#fn_858"><font size="1">3</font></a>; in the ideas of the calamities, dangers, fears, and misfortunes to which it is subject; of its instability under the changing conditions of life; of its liability to dissolution, its want of firmness, its being no true place of refuge, no cave of security, no home of protection, no right object of trust; of its vanity, emptiness, danger, and insubstantiality [<b>419</b>]; of its being the source of pains and subject to</p>

 <p>punishments <a name="fr_869"></a><a href="#fn_859"><font size="1">1</font></a> and full of impurity, a mongrel compound of conditions and qualities that have no coherence; of its being the food alike of evil and of the Evil One <a name="fr_870"></a><a href="#fn_860"><font size="1">2</font></a>; of its inherent liability to rebirths, old age, disease, and death, to griefs, lamentations, despair; and of the corruption of the cravings and delusions that are never absent from it. This, O king, is the third of the qualities of the archer he ought to have.</p>
 <p>18. 'And again, O king, just as the archer practises early and late; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, practise meditation early and late. For it was said, O king, by Sâriputta, the Elder, the Commander of the Faith:</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"Early and late the true archer will practise,<br>
 'Tis only by never neglecting his art,<br>
 That he earns the reward and the wage of his skill.<br>
 So the sons of the Buddha, too, practise their art.<br>
 It is just by never neglecting in thought<br>
 The conditions of life in this bodily frame<br>
 That they gain the rich fruits which the Arahats love <a name="fr_871"></a><a href="#fn_861"><font size="1">3</font></a>."'</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p align="CENTER">____________________________</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Here ends the fifth riddle, the riddle of the archer.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">____________________________</p>
 <p>Here end the two hundred and sixty-two questions of Milinda, as handed down in the book in its six parts, adorned with twenty-two chapters. Now those which have not been handed down are forty-</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_373"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 373</font></a></p>
 <p>two <a name="fr_872"></a><a href="#fn_862"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Taking together all those that have been, and those that have not been, handed down, there are three hundred plus four, all of which are reckoned as 'Questions of Milinda <a name="fr_873"></a><a href="#fn_863"><font size="1">2</font></a>.'</p>
 <p>19. On the conclusion of this putting of puzzles and giving of solutions between the king and the Elder, this great earth, eighty-four thousand leagues in extent, shook six times even to its ocean boundary, the lightnings flashed, the gods poured down a rainfall of flowers from heaven, Mahâ Brahmâ himself signified his applause, and there was a mighty roar like the crashing and thundering of a storm in the mighty deep. And on beholding that wonder, the five hundred high ministers of the king, and all the inhabitants of the city of Sâgala who were there, and the women of the king's palace, bowed down before Nâgasena, the great teacher, raising their clasped hands to their foreheads, and departed thence <a name="fr_874"></a><a href="#fn_864"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>
 <p>20. [<b>420</b>] But Milinda the king was filled with joy of heart, and all pride was suppressed within him. And he became aware of the virtue that lay in the religion of the Buddhas, he ceased to have any doubt at all in the Three Gems <a name="fr_875"></a><a href="#fn_865"><font size="1">4</font></a>, he tarried no longer in the jungle of heresy, he renounced all obstinacy; and pleased beyond measure at the high</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>

 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_374"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 374</font></a></p>
 <p>qualities of the Elder, at the excellence of his manners befitting a recluse, he become filled with confidence, and free from cravings, and all his pride and self-righteousness left his heart; and like a cobra deprived of its fangs he said: 'Most excellent, most excellent, venerable Nâgasena! The puzzles, worthy of a Buddha to solve, have you made clear. There is none like you, amongst all the followers of the Buddha, in the solution of problems, save only Sâriputta, the Elder, himself, the Commander of the Faith. Pardon me, venerable Nâgasena, my faults. May the venerable Nâgasena accept me as a supporter of the faith, as a true convert from to-day onwards as long as life shall last!'</p>
 <p>21. Thenceforward the king and his mighty men continued in paying honour to Nâgasena. And the king had a Wihâra built called 'The Milinda Wihâra,' and handed it over to Nâgasena, the Elder, and waited upon him and all the multitude of the Arahat Bhikshus of whom he was the chief with the four requisites of the Bhikshu's life. And afterwards, taking delight in the wisdom of the Elder, he handed over his kingdom to his son, and abandoning the household life for the houseless state, grew great in insight, and himself attained to Arahatship! Therefore is it said:</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>'Wisdom is magnified o'er all the world,<br>
 And preaching for the endurance of the Faith.<br>
 When they, by wisdom, have put doubt aside<br>
 The wise reach upward to that Tranquil State.<br>
 That man in whom wisdom is firmly set,<br>
 And mindful self-possession never fails,<br>
 He is the best of those who gifts receive,<br>
 The chief of men to whom distinction's given. <a name="page_375"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 375</font></a><br>
 Let therefore able men, in due regard<br>
 To their own welfare <a name="fr_876"></a><a href="#fn_866"><font size="1">1</font></a>, honour those who're wise,--<br>
 Worthy of honour like the sacred pile<br>
 Beneath whose solid dome the bones of the great dead lie <a name="fr_877"></a><a href="#fn_867"><font size="1">2</font></a>.'</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>Here ends the book of the puzzles and the solutions of Milinda and Nâgasena <a name="fr_878"></a><a href="#fn_868"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_864"></a><a href="sbe3615.htm#fr_874">373:3</a> I here follow Hîna<i>t</i>i-kumburê, who has apparently had a fuller text before him.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_865"></a><a href="sbe3615.htm#fr_875">373:4</a> The Buddha, his religion, and his order.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_866"></a><a href="sbe3615.htm#fr_876">375:1</a> This line is identical with the sixth line of the little poem on the gift of Wihâras preserved in the <i>K</i>ullavagga VI, 1, 5, and VI, 9, 2, and quoted as a whole in the <i>G</i>âtaka, book I, 93, and in part above IV, 5, 1. This line also occurs, in a third connection, at <i>G</i>âtaka IV, 354.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_867"></a><a href="sbe3615.htm#fr_877">375:2</a> These verses differ from those here given by Hîna<i>t</i>i-kumburê, which I have quoted in the Introduction to this volume.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_868"></a><a href="sbe3615.htm#fr_878">375:3</a> This closing title is omitted by Hîna<i>t</i>i-kumburê, who gives instead of it a second account of how he came to write his translation, and then adds as the closing title to his own book: 'Here ends the <i>S</i>rî Saddharmâdâsaya (the Mirror of the Good Law) made by Sîna<i>t</i>i-kumburê Suma<u>n</u>gala, the Elder! [Sîna<i>t</i>i is merely the Elu form of the Si<i>m</i>halese word Hîna<i>t</i>i, which is the name of a plant, coryza sativa; and Hîna<i>t</i>i-kumburê is the locative of the name of the place, Hîna<i>t</i>i-field, where he was born. Every unnânsê in Ceylon has such a local name in addition to his religious name. And the religious names being often identical (there are, for instance, many Suma<u>n</u>galas), the Bhikkhus are usually spoken of by the former, and not by the latter.]</p><p></p><hr>
