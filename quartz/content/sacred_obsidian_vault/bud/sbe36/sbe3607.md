 <h3 align="CENTER">THE PROBLEM OF INFERENCE.</h3>
 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>[<b>329</b>] 1. Now Milinda the king went up to the place where Nâgasena was, and bowed down before him, and took his seat on one side. And when so seated he, longing to know, to hear, and to remember, and longing to make the light of knowledge arise and to break in pieces his ignorance, roused up in himself courage and zeal, and, full of self-possession and thoughtfulness, spake thus to Nâgasena:</p>
 <p>2. 'Venerable Nâgasena, tell me, have you ever seen the Buddha <a name="fr_489"></a><a href="#fn_486"><font size="1">1</font></a>?'</p>
 <p>'No, O king.'</p>
 <p>'Then have your teachers ever seen the Buddha?'</p>
 <p>'No, Sire.'</p>
 <p>'So you say, venerable Nâgasena, that you have never seen the Buddha, and that your teachers have never seen the Buddha. Therefore, Nâgasena, the Buddha did not exist. There is no clear evidence, in that case, of a Buddha.'</p>
 <p>'But did those Kshatriyas of old exist, who were the founders of the line of kings from which you come?'</p>
 <p>'Certainly, Sir. How can there be any doubt about that?'</p>
 <p>'Well, O king. Have you ever seen them?'</p>
 <p>'No, Sir.'</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_207"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 207</font></a></p>
 <p>'And those who instructed you--the family chaplains, and officers of the staff, and those who lay down the law, and ministers of state--have they ever seen those Kshatriyas of old?'</p>
 <p>'No, Sir.'</p>
 <p>'If then neither have you seen them, nor your teachers, where are they? There is no clear evidence, in that case, of those Kshatriyas of old!'</p>
 <p>3. 'But, Nâgasena, the royal insignia they used are still to be seen--[<b>330</b>] the white sunshade of state, and the crown, and the slippers, and the fan with the yak's tail, and the sword of state, and the priceless throne--and by these can we know and believe that the Kshatriyas of old lived once.'</p>
 <p>'Just so, O king, can we know that Blessed One and believe in him. For there is a reason for our knowledge and belief that the Blessed One was. And what is that reason?--The royal insignia used by that Blessed One, by him of knowledge and insight, the Arahat, the Buddha Supreme, are still to be seen-the four Means of keeping oneself ready and mindful, and the fourfold Great Struggle, and the four steps to Iddhi, and the five Organs of the moral sense, and the five moral Powers, and the seven forms of the wisdom of the Arahats, and the Noble Eightfold Path <a name="fr_490"></a><a href="#fn_487"><font size="1">1</font></a>--and by these can the whole</p>

 </p>
 <p><a name="page_208"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 208</font></a></p>
 <p>world of gods and men know and believe that that Blessed One existed once. By this reason, on this ground, by this argument, through this inference, can it be known that the Blessed One lived.</p><dir>

 <p>4. 'Venerable Nâgasena, give me an illustration.'</p>
 <p>'Just, O king, as the architect of a City <a name="fr_492"></a><a href="#fn_489"><font size="1">2</font></a>, when he wants to build one, would first search out a pleasant spot of ground, with which no fault can be found, even, with no hills or gullies in it, free from rough ground and rocks, not open to the danger of attack. And then, when he has made plain any rough places there may still be on it, he would clear it thoroughly of all stumps and stakes, and would proceed to build there a city fine and regular, measured out into suitable quarters <a name="fr_493"></a><a href="#fn_490"><font size="1">3</font></a>, with trenches and ramparts thrown up around it <a name="fr_494"></a><a href="#fn_491"><font size="1">4</font></a>, with strong gateways, watch-towers, and battlements, with wide squares and open places and junctions (where two roads meet) and cross-ways (where four</p>

And then when the city stood there in all its glory, he would go away to some other land.

 <p>of the Buddhas, [<b>332</b>] overthrew Mâra and all his hosts,--he, bursting asunder the net of heresy, and casting aside ignorance, and causing wisdom to arise, and bearing aloft the torch of Truth, reached forward to Buddhahood itself, and so, unconquered and unconquerable in the fight, built this city of Righteousness. And the Blessed One's City of Righteousness, O king, has righteousness for its rampart, and fear of sin for its moat, and knowledge for the battlement over its city gate, and zeal for the watch-tower above that, and faith for the pillars at its base, and mindfulness for the watchman at the gate, and wisdom for the terrace above, and the Suttantas for its market-place, and the Abhidhamma for its cross-ways, and the Vinaya (the Canon Law) for its judgment hall, and constant self-possession for its chief street. And in that street, O king, these bazaars are open--a flower bazaar, and a fruit bazaar, and an antidote bazaar, and a medicine bazaar, and an ambrosia bazaar, and a bazaar for precious stones, and a bazaar for all manner of merchandise.'</p>
 <p>6. 'But what, venerable Nâgasena, is the flower bazaar of the Blessed One, the Buddha?'</p>
 <p>'There are certain subjects for meditation, O king, that have been made known by the Blessed One, by him of knowledge and insight, by the Arahat, the Buddha Supreme. And they are these. The idea of the impermanence (of every thing and of every being), the idea of the absence of any abiding principle (any soul in any thing or any being), the idea of the impurity and the idea of the danger connected with the body, the idea of getting rid of evil dispositions, the idea of freedom from passion, the idea of peace, the idea of dissatisfaction with the</p>
 <p><a name="page_213"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 213</font></a></p>
 <p>things of the world, the idea of the transitory nature of all conditions, the idea of ecstatic trance, the ideas of a corpse in the various stages of decay, the ideas of a place of execution in all its various horrors, the idea of love to all beings, the idea of pity for all beings, the idea of sympathy with all beings, the idea of equanimity in all the changing circumstances of life, the idea of death, and the idea of the body <a name="fr_514"></a><a href="#fn_511"><font size="1">1</font></a>. These, O king, are the subjects for meditation prescribed by the Blessed One. And of these, whoever, longing to be delivered from old age and death, takes any one as the subject of his meditation, by that meditation does he become set free from passion, set free from malice, set free from dullness, set free from pride, set free from wrong views, by that does he cross the ocean of Sa<i>m</i>sâra, and stem the torrent of cravings, and cleanse himself of the threefold stain <a name="fr_515"></a><a href="#fn_512"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and destroy within himself all evil; and so, entering that glorious city, spotless and stainless, pure and white, [<b>333</b>] ageless and deathless, where all is security and calm and bliss--the city of Nirvâ<i>n</i>a--he emancipates his mind in Arahatship! And this, O king, is what is called "The Blessed One's bazaar of flowers."</p><dir>

 <p>7. 'And what, venerable Nâgasena, is the perfume bazaar of the Blessed One, the Buddha?'</p>
 <p>'There are certain categories of virtue, O king, that have been made known by the Blessed One, and anointed by the perfume of that righteousness the children of the Blessed One fill with the fumes of the fragrant incense of the perfume of goodness the whole world of gods and men, in every direction, and to windward and to leeward, continuing to pervade it again and yet again. And which are those categories? The virtue of taking refuge <a name="fr_517"></a><a href="#fn_514"><font size="1">1</font></a>,</p>

 <p><a name="page_215"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 215</font></a></p>

And this, O king, is what is called "The Blessed One's bazaar of perfumes." For it has been said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all gods:</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"No flower's scent can go against the wind,<br>
 Not sandal wood's, nor musk's, nor jasmine flower's:<br>
 But the sweet perfume of the good doth go<br>
 Against the wind, and the good man pervades,<br>
 On every side, the sweetness of his life <a name="fr_520"></a><a href="#fn_517"><font size="1">3</font></a>."</p>
 <p>"Red sandal wood, musk, and the lotus, and jasmine--<br>
 The perfume of goodness surpasseth them all.<br>
 Abundant the sweet scent of musk and of sandal wood--<br>

 </dir>
 
 <p>8. 'And what, venerable Nâgasena, is the fruit bazaar of the Blessed One, the Buddha?'</p>
 <p>'Certain fruits have been made known, O king, by the Blessed One. And they are these:--The fruit of the first stage of the Excellent Way (conversion),</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_216"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 216</font></a></p>
 <p>and of the second stage, and of the third stage, and of the fourth (Arahatship) <a name="fr_522"></a><a href="#fn_519"><font size="1">1</font></a>,--the fruit of the attainment of emptiness <a name="fr_523"></a><a href="#fn_520"><font size="1">2</font></a>--the fruit of the attainment of the absence of the three signs (of an unconverted life, lust, malice, and dullness)--and the truth of the attainment of that state in which no low aspirations survive. [<b>334</b>] And whosoever desires any one of these, he gives his Karma as the price, and buys the fruit he longs for--either conversion or any other.</p>
 <p>9. 'Just, O king, as any man who has a mango-tree bearing fruit all the year round, he does not knock down the fruits until buyers come. But when a buyer has come, and the fruit-grower has taken the price, then he says: "Come, my good man, this tree is always in bearing (it has therefore fruits in all stages of growth), take from it the kind of fruit you prefer, whether unripe, or decayed <a name="fr_524"></a><a href="#fn_521"><font size="1">3</font></a>, or hairy <a name="fr_525"></a><a href="#fn_522"><font size="1">4</font></a>, or sour, or ripe <a name="fr_526"></a><a href="#fn_523"><font size="1">5</font></a>." And the buyer, for the price paid, takes the kind he likes the best-if that be unripe fruit then he takes that, if it be decayed fruit then that, if it be hairy fruit then that, if it be sour fruit then that, if it be ripe fruit then he takes a ripe one. Just so, O king, whosoever desires any one of those other fruits, he gives his Karma as the price, and buys the fruit he longs for-</p>

 <p>'Certain drugs, O king, have been made known by the Blessed One; drugs by which the Blessed One delivers the whole world of gods and men from the poison of evil dispositions. And what are these drugs? The four Noble Truths made known by the Blessed One, that is to say, the truth as to sorrow, and the truth as to the origin of sorrow, and the truth as to the cessation of sorrow, and the truth as to that path which leads to the cessation of sorrow <a name="fr_528"></a><a href="#fn_525"><font size="1">2</font></a>. And whosoever, longing for the highest insight (the insight of Arahatship) <a name="fr_529"></a><a href="#fn_526"><font size="1">3</font></a>, hear this doctrine of the four truths, they are set quite free from rebirth, [<b>335</b>] they are set quite free from old age, they are set quite free from death, they are set quite free from grief, lamentation, pain, sorrow, and despair.

By these medicines the Blessed One purges men of wrong views, purges them of low aspirations, purges them of evil speaking, purges them of evil deeds, purges them of evil modes of livelihood, purges them of wrong endeavours, purges them of evil thoughts, purges them of erroneous meditation; and he gives emetics to the vomiting up of lusts, and of malice, and of dullness, and of doubt, and of self-righteousness, and of sloth of body and inertness of mind, and of shamelessness and hardness of heart, and of all evil.

 <p><a name="fn_513"></a><a href="sbe3607.htm#fr_516">213:3</a> This stanza has not yet been found in the Pi<i>t</i>akas. In the first line it does not seem quite clear at first sight why Karma, of all things, should be the price. That Indian word being too <a name="page_214"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 214</font></a> full of meaning to be translateable, is necessarily retained, and hence the phrase 'taking Karma as the price' may convey no meaning at all. If so, in trying to escape Scylla the unhappy translator has fallen into Charybdis. But it must mean one of two things, either something to be abandoned, given up; or something good which the buyer possesses, and may exchange for the good he wants to buy. If our author means the first it must be Karma (as one of the Upadhis), as a basis for continued individuality, and be much the same as egoism. If he means the other, then Karma, though standing alone, must be here used in the sense of kusala-kamma, good Karma, that is, the effect of good deeds done in a former life. Now our author never elsewhere uses kamma, without any qualifying adjective, in the sense of good Karma. On pp. 7, 20, 67, 108 foll., 134, 151, 189, 302 of the Pâli the unqualified word means throughout bad Karma, the effect of bad deeds done in a former birth. In a few passages it is used of former deeds in a way that apparently includes both good and bad. See especially pp. 3, 10, 146, 268. Now a buyer, in the case put, could not give up either the bad or the good deeds he had already done in a former life--that would be beyond his power. He could only offer, in exchange for the good he wanted to buy, good Karma (that is, in the sense of good deeds) either in the present, or in the immediate future. Below, V, 21 (p. 341 of the Pâli), will be found instances given by our author himself. It is forced, no doubt, to call this 'a price,' but it is probably the sense intended, and so Hîna<i>t</i>i-kumburê takes it.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_531"></a><a href="sbe3607.htm#fr_534">219:3</a> It will be noticed that Nâgasena is here really going an inch beyond his text. In that text (which has not been traced) amata, ambrosia, means no doubt as elsewhere, the ambrosia of Nirvâ<i>n</i>a. And the text does not say that the active attention and the ambrosia are the same, but only that they who feed on the one feed also on the other. Even if we translate 'are feeding' instead of 'feed' (which is grammatically possible) a similar argument would hold good. But though it is impossible to say for certain, without knowing the context of the passage, the rendering above is more in accord with Pâli usage, and more likely therefore to be right.</p>

This verse is quoted at <i>G</i>âtaka I, 13, verse 51, and the word is there spelt sala<i>l</i>a. The Si<i>m</i>halese has salala, and the Sanskrit lexicons have sarala. Clough identifies it, no doubt wrongly, with the last, the Anglo-Indian Hal tree, which the botanists call the Shorea robusta.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_552"></a><a href="sbe3607.htm#fr_555">224:7</a> Yûthikâ; sînidda, says Hîna<i>t</i>i-kumburê, p. 492, and Clough thinks this is oleander. But Böhtlingk-Roth say a sort of jasmine, Jasminum auriculatum.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_553"></a><a href="sbe3607.htm#fr_556">224:8</a> Yohombu in the Si<i>m</i>halese. Clough says this is a creeper called Borago Zeylanica. But does that grow in the North-West of India? According to Böhtlingk-Roth, Atimuttaka is the <a name="page_225"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 225</font></a> name of three plants, one of which is the Gaertnera Racemosa, much cultivated for the beauty and perfume of its flowers.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_554"></a><a href="sbe3607.htm#fr_557">225:1</a> The last four are the Pâ<i>t</i>alî, Uppala, Vassika, and Mallikâ, all of which are well known. Our author's flora and fauna are so numerous that one ought, if one had the necessary knowledge, to be able to draw conclusions as to his own 'habitat.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_555"></a><a href="sbe3607.htm#fr_558">225:2</a> On the use of upâdây' upâdâya see above, p. 182, and below, p. 341 of the Pâli.</p>

It is the doctrine of 'final assurance' from the Buddhist point of view. Compare <i>ñ</i>â<i>n</i>adassana at Dîgha II, 83.</p>

Childers, sub voce, gives the various interpretations of other authorities. Compare above, I, 29, 34) 36. The third and fourth seem to me to be doubtful.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_558"></a><a href="sbe3607.htm#fr_561">227:1</a> Pa<i>ñk</i>âvudho; literally 'with the five weapons on.' The expression is not infrequent; compare pa<i>ñk</i>âvudha-sannaddha, used of a hunter, at <i>G</i>âtaka III, 467; IV, 283, 437; and sannaddha-pa<i>ñk</i>âvudhâ, used of sailors fighting, at <i>G</i>âtaka IV, 160. But it is quite possible that weapons different from those here described are there meant, as they are not suited, for instance, to the hunter.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_559"></a><a href="sbe3607.htm#fr_562">227:2</a> Hîna<i>t</i>i-kumburê translates this weapon (ma<i>nd</i>alagga) simply by ka<i>d</i>uwa, sword; but 'bent blade' must mean a sabre.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_560"></a><a href="sbe3607.htm#fr_563">227:3</a> <i>Kh</i>urikâ. Childers has only 'knife.' The Si<i>m</i>halese, p. 493, has kirisaya, which is not in Clough, but is doubtless the Malay kreese. These five weapons are not mentioned elsewhere, and as three of the five words are rare, are probably those in special use in the country where our author lived. In this respect it is noteworthy that the Sanskrit kshurikâ is only mentioned, according to Böhtlingk-Roth, in the Râ<i>g</i>a Tara<u>n</u>ginî of Kashmir, and in the title of a late Upanishad. We shall therefore scarcely go far wrong if we understand by our author's <i>kh</i>urikâ the famous Afghan knife.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_561"></a><a href="sbe3607.htm#fr_564">227:4</a> Arthayen arthaya ga<i>l</i>apâ, &amp;c., says the Si<i>m</i>halese. He <a name="page_228"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 228</font></a> will reply by adducing parallel passages, much in the style of modern scholarship.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_562"></a><a href="sbe3607.htm#fr_565">228:1</a> He gives the principal ones, as set out in his previous arguments.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_563"></a><a href="sbe3607.htm#fr_566">228:2</a> Nirutti. Hîna<i>t</i>i-kumburê unfortunately simply repeats all these technical terms.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_564"></a><a href="sbe3607.htm#fr_567">228:3</a> Lakkhana. As for instance above, I. 51-62.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_565"></a><a href="sbe3607.htm#fr_568">229:1</a> Phaseyya; literally 'he who having bought pa<i>t</i>isambhidâ shall touch it with his <i>ñ</i>â<i>n</i>a.' The Si<i>m</i>halese, p. 494, has spar<i>s</i>ako<i>t</i>a, which does not help us.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_566"></a><a href="sbe3607.htm#fr_569">229:2</a> The Si<i>m</i>halese again only repeats these seven technical terms, except the second Dhamma-vi<i>k</i>aya, which it renders by pra<i>gñ</i>â.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_567"></a><a href="sbe3607.htm#fr_570">229:3</a> Bodhi. Childers says, 'the supreme knowledge of a Buddha.' But this is wrong, as is evident even from the context here. The whole exposition is of Arahatship, not Buddhahood.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_568"></a><a href="sbe3607.htm#fr_571">230:1</a> Hîna<i>t</i>i-kumburê, characteristically enough for a Ceylon man, adds, 'and the Footprint and the Bo-tree.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_580"></a><a href="sbe3607.htm#fr_583">235:3</a> That is the fall of beings from one state of existence--their death in that state in other words--and their rise, their rebirth, in another.</p>

The Si<i>m</i>halese repeats this ambiguous expression, adding the qualification amâtyayo, 'ministers, officials.' One would think that these would have been the judges, but our author has already made the Arahats the judges in his Dhamma-nagara. This only leaves him some minor official post to give away to those learned in Canon Law, and he has chosen one as unintelligible in Ceylon as it is to me.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_589"></a><a href="sbe3607.htm#fr_592">237:2</a> Abhidhamme abhivinaye. A phrase very instructive as to the correct rendering of the much misunderstood word abhidhamma. As I pointed out already in the 'Hibbert Lectures' for 1881, it is a blunder to translate it, as is usually done, by 'metaphysics.' The whole context is taken from the Sangîti Sutta.</p>
