This, O king, is the first of the qualities of the earth he ought to have.</p>
 <p>2. 'And again, O king, as the earth has no adornment, no garlands, but is suffused with the odour of itself; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, wear no finery, but rather be set round with the sweet savour of his own righteousness of life.

This, O king, [<b>392</b>] is the third quality of the sovran overlord he ought to have.

'And again, O king, as the sovran overlord is completely provided with protection, both within and without; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, keep self-possession as his door-keeper for a protection against all evil, subjective and objective.

 <p><a name="fn_743"></a><a href="sbe3611.htm#fr_752">308:1</a> This simile has already occurred above, I, 258, 259 (of the translation).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_744"></a><a href="sbe3611.htm#fr_753">308:2</a> The Si<i>m</i>halese (pp. 563, 564) gives the whole story. She was the daughter of Anâthapi<i>nd</i>ika (Sudatta), the famous supporter of the Buddha, and builder of the <i>G</i>etavana at Sâvatthi. On her marriage to a rich merchant at Sâketa (Audh) named Kâlaka, he invited the Brahman naked ascetics of his sect, the Â<i>g</i>îvakas, and asked her to go and entertain 'the Arahats.' Hearing the word Arahat she went quickly and full of delight to do so; and was shocked beyond measure to find a number of disorderly fakirs, with neither modesty in their hearts, nor decency in their outward behaviour. So she fled from the hall, and on her husband remonstrating, was indignant. He then asked her what the recluses <a name="page_309"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 309</font></a> of her sect were like, and she told him. Another verse from her description is quoted below, p. 387 of the Pâli. The above story has been often repeated.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_745"></a><a href="sbe3611.htm#fr_754">309:1</a> Not traced. Hîna<i>t</i>i-kumburê reads eka<i>ñ</i> <i>k</i>e bâha<i>m</i> (twice) and mânaso, pamodito; and he is no doubt right.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_746"></a><a href="sbe3611.htm#fr_755">310:1</a> Ritta<i>ggh</i>âna, which Hîna<i>t</i>i-kumburê renders siswa kipîma.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_747"></a><a href="sbe3611.htm#fr_756">310:2</a> These words are in the original ascribed, not to the Buddha himself, but to Ka<i>n</i>ha-kumâro, the then Bodisat.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_748"></a><a href="sbe3611.htm#fr_757">310:3</a> <i>G</i>âtaka IV, 14. Professor Fausböll reads ma<i>m</i> kate, but the Si<i>m</i>halese (pp. 566, 567) confirms Mr. Trenckner's reading, ma<i>m</i> kâna, ma<i>m</i> nissâya, ma<i>m</i> anattha-kâmatâya.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_749"></a><a href="sbe3611.htm#fr_758">312:1</a> Not traced as yet exactly in these words. But the passage at Ma<i>ggh</i>ima Nikâya I, 424, lines 3-6, agrees with it throughout, except that for akusalâ dhammâ here we have there manapâ-manâpa phassâ, which comes to much the same thing. As the words are there addressed to Râhula, and as our passage here is introduced with the same formula as the quotation below (p. 388 of the Pâli) which is certainly taken from the same page of the Ma<i>ggh</i>ima, I think the above (M. I, 424, lines 3-6) is most probably the passage our author now intended to quote. If so, we have here a real case of difference in reading.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_752"></a><a href="sbe3611.htm#fr_761">314:2</a> From the Sutta Nipâta III, 9, 35. It is also included in the Dhammapada collection of Scripture verses (No. 404).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_754"></a><a href="sbe3611.htm#fr_763">315:2</a> This verse, not traced elsewhere as yet, is included in the Dhammapada collection as verse 28.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_755"></a><a href="sbe3611.htm#fr_764">316:1</a> Bhûta, which the Si<i>m</i>halese, p. 572, renders yaksha. I think it means all kinds of gods (except the highest), demigods, fairies, superhuman beings, &amp;c.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_757"></a><a href="sbe3611.htm#fr_766">318:1</a> Âgamâdhigame. These are two, not one. Âgama adhigama dekhi da says the Si<i>m</i>halese, p. 573.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_758"></a><a href="sbe3611.htm#fr_767">318:2</a> U<i>l</i>ârâdhipati. Dr. Morris in the 'Journal of the Pâli Text Society' (1880, p. 107) ingeniously proposes to read u<i>l</i>urâgâdhipati, 'king and lord over the u<i>l</i>u's, the lunar mansions! In that case the u<i>l</i>âra in the latter clause of the sentence would be a play upon words. But Mr. Trenckner's reading is confirmed by the Si<i>m</i>halese, which has <i>k</i>andra diwya-râ<i>g</i>a tema mahatwû sisira-gu<i>n</i>aye<i>m</i> adhipati wûyeya, 'the moon, that heavenly king, is a lord by reason of his great coldness.' And the reading may well stand, for the mention, in the latter part of the clause, of the thing over which the Bhikshu is to be lord does not necessarily require a corresponding word in the first part. We have numerous instances in these similes of the ethical interpretation of the physical simile being an addition, with nothing corresponding to it in the type discussed. The moon was a god, lord over other things besides the lunar mansions.</p>
 <p><a name="page_319"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 319</font></a></p>
 <p>This, O king, is the second quality of the moon he ought to have.</p>
 <p>33. 'And again, O king, as the moon wanders at night; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be given to solitude. [<b>389</b>] This, O king, is the third quality of the moon he ought to have.</p>
 <p>34. 'And again, O king, as the moon hoists a standard over his mansion <a name="fr_768"></a><a href="#fn_759"><font size="1">1</font></a>; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, hoist the standard of righteousness. This, O king, is the fourth quality of the moon he ought to have.</p>
 <p>35. 'And again, O king, as the moon rises when begged and prayed to do so; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, frequent for alms those families who have asked and invited him to do so <a name="fr_769"></a><a href="#fn_760"><font size="1">2</font></a>. This, O king, is the fifth quality of the moon he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all gods, in the most excellent Samyutta, Nikâya:</p>
 <p>"Like the moon, O brethren, let your visits be paid to the laity. Drawing back alike in outward demeanour and in inward spirit, be ye always, as strangers on their first visit, retiring in the presence of the laity. [As the man who looks down a deep</p>

 </p><p><a name="fn_759"></a><a href="sbe3611.htm#fr_768">319:1</a> <i>K</i>ando vimâna-ketu. 'Has his mansion, forty-nine yo<i>g</i>anas in extent, as his banner,' says Hîna<i>t</i>i-kumburê. (A yo<i>g</i>ana is seven miles.) Vimâna does not mean lunar mansion, but the palace which every deity, and therefore also the moon, is supposed to inhabit.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_760"></a><a href="sbe3611.htm#fr_769">319:2</a> The Si<i>m</i>halese, p. 573, has the exact opposite. 'As the moon rises whether begged to do so or not, so should the Bhikshu visit the laity whether invited to do so or not.' But the Pâli must be right, as the subsequent quotation shows.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_761"></a><a href="sbe3611.htm#fr_770">320:1</a> Samyutta, XVI, 3, 2, 3. The sentence in brackets is added from Hîna<i>t</i>i-kumburê, who gives here, p. 274, the Pâli text. Apakassa, the gerund of ava-karsh, and naviyâ, 'new-comers,' are only found in this passage. In three cases M. Léon Feer has here gone wrong, as he has so often elsewhere done, by putting the readings of the Si<i>m</i>halese MSS. only in the notes, and adopting the Burmese readings in the text. He should have read, as Hîna<i>t</i>i-kumburê does, ni<i>kk</i>am naviyâ . . . . . . gambhîrûdapâna<i>m</i>, . . . . . . nadî-dugga<i>m</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_762"></a><a href="sbe3611.htm#fr_771">322:1</a> Not traced as yet.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_763"></a><a href="sbe3611.htm#fr_772">323:1</a> Not traced as yet.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_764"></a><a href="sbe3611.htm#fr_773">324:1</a> This verse has not been elsewhere traced as yet, but is included in the Dhammapada collection, verse 350. Vitakka, which, in accord with the context and with Hîna<i>t</i>i-kumburê, is rendered above 'evil thoughts,' and by Professor Max Müller 'doubts,' really means simply 'thoughts,' and is sometimes used without any bad connotation. In the Pâli the word Mâru, which spoils the metre, may possibly be an ancient gloss introduced by mistake into the text.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_765"></a><a href="sbe3611.htm#fr_774">324:2</a> Anuyâyati, which is only found here, and which the Si<i>m</i>halese, p. 577, renders anu<i>s</i>âsanâ karanneya. But compare ânuyâyin at Sutta Nipâta V, 7, 3-5, and Tela Ka<i>t</i>aha Gâthâ 25, anuyâyin above, p. 284 of the Pâli, and ânuyâto at Tela Ka<i>t</i>âha Gâthâ 41.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_766"></a><a href="sbe3611.htm#fr_775">324:3</a> Mr. Trenckner points out that this passage is taken from the A<u>n</u>guttara X, 5, 8. Hîna<i>t</i>i-kumburê, who gives the Pâli, prints it as verse, and translates the context at some length.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_767"></a><a href="sbe3611.htm#fr_776">325:1</a> Not traced as yet, but the same phrase from 'puts away evil' to the end occurs at <i>G</i>âtaka I, 130, 131.</p>
