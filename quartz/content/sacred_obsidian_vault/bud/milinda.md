 This is a translation of a series of dialogues between King Milinda
 and Nagasena, a Buddhist scholar.
 <cite>The Questions of King Milinda</cite>
 deals with some of the thorniest questions of Buddhism,
 religion and existence.
 The narrative proceeds in a cyclical fashion as the King proposes
 a difficult question of Nagasena, who responds typically
 with either a tale about the Buddha in some previous life,
 or an analogy.
 The book represents Southern Buddhism at an advanced stage of development.
 While difficult questions are addressed here, <cite>Milinda</cite>
 makes fascinating reading, as many of the issues are common to all religions.

 These volumes were reprinted by Dover publications in 1963; unfortunately
 the Dover edition is now out of print; you may be able to find
 used copies, however.
