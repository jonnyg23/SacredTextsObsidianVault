   <h5 align="center"><i>b. Belief in the Existence of Atman in Things.</i></h5>  
 <p>As the World-honored One (<i>Bhagavat</i>), considering the inferior intellectual calibre of Çrâvakas and Pratyekabuddhas, taught them only the doctrine of non-personal âtman, [and did not make any further</p>  
 <p><a name="page_112"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 112</font></a></p>  
 <p>demonstration of the doctrine], the people have in the meantime formed a fixed idea on the transitoriness of the five skandhas, <a name="fr_166"></a><a href="#fn_166"><font size="1">1</font></a> and, being terrified at the thought of birth and death, have fanatically craved for Nirvâna.</p>  
 <p>In order that this clinging may be eliminated, be it clearly understood that the essence of the five skandhas is uncreate, there is no annihilation of them; that since there is no annihilation of them, they are in their [metaphysical] origin Nirvâna itself; that if one be absolutely freed from particularisation and attachment, one will understand that all things both pure and defiled have only relative existence.</p>  
 <p>Be it therefore known that all things in the world from the beginning are neither matter (<i>rûpa</i>), nor mind (<i>citta</i>), nor intelligence (<i>prajñâ</i>), nor consciousness (<i>vijñâna</i>), nor non-being (<i>abhâva</i>), nor being (<i>bhâva</i>); they are after all inexplicable. The reason why the Tathâgata nevertheless endeavors to instruct by means of words and definitions is through his good and excellent skilfulness [or expediency, <i>upâya-kauçalya</i>]. <a name="fr_167"></a><a href="#fn_167"><font size="1">2</font></a> He only provisionally makes use of words and definitions to lead all beings, while his real object is to make them abandon symbolism and directly enter</p>

 <p>into the real reality (<i>tattva</i>). Because if they indulge themselves in reasonings, attach themselves to sophistry, and thus foster their subjective particularisation, how could they have the true wisdom (<i>tattvajñâna</i>) and attain to Nirvâna?</p>
