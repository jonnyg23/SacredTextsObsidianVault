   <h3 align="center">II. GENERAL STATEMENT.</h3>  
 <p>In what does the general statement consist?</p>  
 <p>The Mahâyâna can be briefly treated as to two aspects, namely, What it is, and What it signifies. <a name="fr_68"></a><a href="#fn_68"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_53"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 53</font></a></p>  
 <p>What is the Mahâyâna? It is the soul <a name="fr_69"></a><a href="#fn_69"><font size="1">1</font></a> of all sentient beings (<i>sarvasattva</i>), that constitutes all things in the world, phenomenal and supra-phenomenal; <a name="fr_70"></a><a href="#fn_70"><font size="1">2</font></a> and through this soul we can disclose what the Mahâyâna signifies.</p>  
 <p>Because the soul in itself, involving the quintessence of the Mahâyâna, is suchness (<i>bhûtatathatâ</i>), but it becomes [in its relative or transitory aspect, through the law of causation] birth-and-death (<i>samsâra</i>) in which are revealed the quintessence, the attributes, and the activity of the Mahâyâna.</p>  
 <p>The Mahâyâna has a triple significance. <a name="fr_71"></a><a href="#fn_71"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>  
 <p>The first is the greatness of quintessence. Because the quintessence of the Mahâyâna as suchness</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_54"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 54</font></a></p>  
 <p>exists in all things, remains unchanged in the pure as well as in the defiled, is always one and the same (<i>samatâ</i>), neither increases nor decreases, and is void of distinction.</p>  
 <p>The second is the greatness of attributes. Here we have the Tathâgata's <a name="fr_72"></a><a href="#fn_72"><font size="1">1</font></a> womb <a name="fr_73"></a><a href="#fn_73"><font size="1">2</font></a> (<i>tathâgatagarbha</i>) which in exuberance contains immeasurable and innumerable merits (<i>punya</i>) as its characteristics.</p>  
 <p>The third is the greatness of activity, for it [i.e., Mahâyâna] produces all kinds of good work in the world, phenomenal and supra-phenomenal. [Hence the name Mahâyâna (great vehicle).]</p>  
 <p>[Again this Dharma is called the Mahâyâna;] because it is the vehicle} <a name="fr_74"></a><a href="#fn_74"><font size="1">3</font></a> (<i>yâna</i>) in which all Buddhas</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_55"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 55</font></a></p>  
 <p>from the beginning have been riding, and Bodhisattvas <a name="fr_75"></a><a href="#fn_75"><font size="1">1</font></a> when riding in it will enter into the state of Buddhahood.</p>

 <h3 align="CENTER">Footnotes</h3>
 <p><a name="fn_68"></a><a href="taf18.htm#fr_68">52:1</a> "What is" and "What signifies" are respectively in Chinese <i>yu fa</i> <a name="img_05200"></a>
 <img src="img/05200.jpg"> and <i>fa</i> <a name="img_05201"></a>
 <img src="img/05201.jpg">, but in the older translation <i>fa</i> <a name="img_05201"></a>
 <img src="img/05201.jpg"> and <i>i</i> <a name="img_05202"></a>
 <img src="img/05202.jpg">. This is a little puzzling, but if we bear in mind that in Chinese as well as in Sanskrit <i>fa</i> or <i>dharma</i> means both the substance itself and its attribute or significance, or law that regulates its movements, we will understand that Paramârtha, the first translator, used <i>fa</i> here in the sense of substance or "what is," while Çikshânanda, the second translator, used the word in the sense of significance or that by which a thing is conceived, the ordinary meaning of <i>i</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_69"></a><a href="taf18.htm#fr_69">53:1</a> "Soul '' is not used here in a dualistic sense, but as Dr. Paul Carus defines it in the last chapter of <i>The Soul of Man</i>. Speaking of the soul of the universe he defines the term as "the formative principle which gave and still gives shape to the world" (<i>loc. cit.</i>, first edition, p. 437). The literal translation of the Chinese character <a name="img_05300"></a>
 <img src="img/05300.jpg"> <i>hsin</i> is kernel, or heart, or essence of all things. The Chinese <i>hsin</i>, however, is rather indiscriminately used in our text for both Sanskrit terms, <i>Hrdaya</i> (kernel or heart) and <i>Citta</i> (mind, the thinking faculty). These terms are more or less synonymous, especially from Açvaghosha's standpoint, that does not allow the transcendental existence of a metaphysical soul-entity. In this translation soul denotes the absolute aspect of suchness, and mind its relative aspect, wherever this distinction is noticeable.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_70"></a><a href="taf18.htm#fr_70">53:2</a> This is a literal translation of the Chinese <i>chu shi chien</i> <a name="img_05301"></a>
 <img src="img/05301.jpg">. It signifies anything transcending conditionality or worldliness.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_71"></a><a href="taf18.htm#fr_71">53:3</a> This triad which has a striking similarity to Spinoza's conception of substance, attributes and modes, also reminds us of the first principles (<i>padârtha</i>) of the Vaiçeshika philosophy, that is, substance (<i>dravya</i>), qualities (<i>guna</i>), and action (<i>karma</i>).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_72"></a><a href="taf18.htm#fr_72">54:1</a> Tathâgata literally means one who thus or truly comes. That the omnipresent principle of suchness could come or go appeared contradictory and seemed to render an explanation necessary. The Vajracchedikâ-Sûtra, Max Müller's English translation, Chap. XXIX: "And again, O Subhûti, if anybody were to say that the Tathâgata goes, or comes, or stands, or sits, or lies down, he, O Subhûti, does not understand the meaning of my preaching. And why? Because the word Tathâgata means one who does not go anywhere, and does not come from anywhere; and therefore he is called the Tathâgata (truly come), holy and fully enlightened."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_73"></a><a href="taf18.htm#fr_73">54:2</a> Cf. the <i>Bhavadgîtâ</i> (<i>Sacred Books of the East</i>, Vol. VIII., Chap. XIV., p. 107): "The great Brahman is a womb for me, in which I cast the seed. From that, O descendant of Bharata! is the birth of all things. Of the bodies, O son of Kuntî! which are born from all wombs, the main womb is the great Brahman, and I am the father, the giver of the seed."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_74"></a><a href="taf18.htm#fr_74">54:3</a> Cf. the <i>Saddharma-pundarîka</i>, Chap. II. (<i>Sacred Books of the East</i>, Vol. XXI., p. 40): "By means of one sole vehicle, to wit, the Buddha-vehicle, Çâriputra, do I teach creatures the law; there is no second, nor a third."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_75"></a><a href="taf18.htm#fr_75">55:1</a> Literally, one who seeks perfect enlightenment, or one who is full of wisdom and compassion.</p>
