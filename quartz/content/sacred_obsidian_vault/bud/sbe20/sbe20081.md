 <p>The moderate Bhikkhus murmured, &amp;c. . . . . told the Blessed One, &amp;c . . . . (down to) He. said to the Bhikkhus: 'Therefore, O Bhikkhus, do I establish a rule of conduct for Bhikkhus about to leave, according to which they ought to behave.</p>

'A Bhikkhu about to leave should, O Bhikkhus, put the wooden articles and earthenware in order, close the doorways and lattices, give the sleeping-places in charge <a name="fr_798"></a><a href="#fn_784"><font size="1">1</font></a> (to some one, and only) then set out.

If not, he should put the bed frame on four stones in that part of the Vihâra which does not leak, and then put the other bed frame (&amp;c., as in last paragraph, to the end).
