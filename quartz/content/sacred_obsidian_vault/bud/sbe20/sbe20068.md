 <p>1. Now when the Blessed One had dwelt at Sâvatthi as long as he thought fit, he went on on his journey towards the Ki<i>t</i>â Hill with a great multitude of Bhikkhus--to wit, with about five hundred Bhikkhus, besides Sâriputta and Moggallâna.</p>  
 <p>And the Bhikkhus who were followers of Assa<i>g</i>i and Punabbasu <a name="fr_602"></a><a href="#fn_592"><font size="1">1</font></a> hearing the news, said one to another, 'Come, Sirs; let us divide all the sleeping accommodation belonging to the Sa<i>m</i>gha. Sâriputta and Moggallâna are men of sinful desires, and are under the influence of sinful desires. We will not provide sleeping-places for them.' And they did so.</p>  
 <p>Now the Blessed One, proceeding on his journey, arrived at the Ki<i>t</i>â Hill. And he addressed a number of Bhikkhus, saying, 'Do you go, O Bhikkhus, to the followers of Assa<i>g</i>i and Punabbasu, and say: "The Blessed One, Sirs, has arrived with a large number of Bhikkhus--to wit, with about five hundred Bhikkhus, besides Sâriputta and Moggallâna. Make ready sleeping-places, Sirs, for the Blessed One, and for the Bhikkhu-sa<i>m</i>gha, and for Sâriputta and Moggallâna."'</p>

 <p>'Even so, Lord,' said those Bhikkhus in assent to the Blessed One and they did so.</p>  
 <p>'There is no sleeping accommodation belonging to the Sa<i>m</i>gha. We have divided it all' (was the reply). 'The Blessed One, Sirs, is welcome: and he may stay in whatever Vihâra he chooses. But Sâriputta and Moggallâna are men of sinful desires, and under the influence thereof; for them we will provide no sleeping-places.'</p>  
 <p>2. 'What then, Sirs? Have you divided sleeping accommodation that is the property of the Sa<i>m</i>gha?'</p>  
 <p>'That is so, Sirs.'</p>  
 <p>The moderate Bhikkhus murmured, &amp;c. (down to) The Blessed One said to the Bhikkhus:</p>  
 <p>'These five things, O Bhikkhus, are unapportionable, and are not to be divided either by the Sa<i>m</i>gha, or by a Ga<i>n</i>a, or by an individual. If divided, the division is void; and whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a thulla<i>k</i><i>k</i>aya. And what are the five (&amp;c., as in V I, 15, 2) <a name="fr_603"></a><a href="#fn_593"><font size="1">1</font></a>?'</p>
