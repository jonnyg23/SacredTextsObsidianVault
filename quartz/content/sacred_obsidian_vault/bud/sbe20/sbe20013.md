To wit--he is impure, he is shameless--a censure has been set on foot against him <a name="fr_59"></a><a href="#fn_58"><font size="1">1</font></a>--the Sa<i>m</i>gha carries out the Kamma--it carries it out lawfully, and in a full quorum.</p>  
 <p>2. 'There are three things, O Bhikkhus, by which, when a Tassa-pâpiyyasikâ-kamma is characterised, it is against the Dhamma, and against the Vinaya, and difficult to be settled; (that is to say), when it has not been carried out in a full assembly of properly qualified persons, according to law and justice, and in the presence of the litigant parties--when it has been carried out without the accused person having been heard--when it has been carried out without the accused person having confessed himself guilty.</p>  
 <p>'These are the three things, O Bhikkhus, by which, when a Tassa-pâpiyyasikâ-kamma is characterised, it is against the Dhamma, and against the Vinaya, and difficult to be settled.</p>

 <p>4. [In this paragraph the 'right conduct' for a Bhikkhu who has been subjected to this Kamma is laid down precisely as in I, 5 for a Bhikkhu subjected to the Ta<i>g</i><i>g</i>aniya-kamma.]</p>  
 <p>Then the Sa<i>m</i>gha carried out the Tassa-pâpiyyasikâ-kamma against Uvâ<i>l</i>a the Bhikkhu.</p>
