 <p>1. The single Bhikkhu who speaks not in accordance with the right, the many who speak not in accordance with the right, the Sa<i>m</i>gha which speaks not in accordance with the right. The single Bhikkhu who speaks in accordance with the right, the many who speak in accordance with the right, the Sa<i>m</i>gha which speaks in accordance with the right <a name="fr_2"></a><a href="#fn_1"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>

 <p>instructs him, saying, 'This is the Dhamma, this the Vinaya, this the teaching of the Master. Accept this, and approve this.' If the dispute should be thus settled, it is settled contrary to the Dhamma, and with a mere counterfeit of the Vinaya rule of procedure (that cases of dispute must be settled before a duly constituted meeting of the Sa<i>m</i>gha, and in the presence of the accused person) <a name="fr_5"></a><a href="#fn_4"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>[And in like manner, if he instruct the many, or the Sa<i>m</i>gha, who speak according to the right;--or if the many or the Sa<i>m</i>gha who speak not according to the right instruct the one, or the many, or the Sa<i>m</i>gha who speak according to the right;-then the dispute is settled contrary to the Dhamma (&amp;c., as before).]</p>
