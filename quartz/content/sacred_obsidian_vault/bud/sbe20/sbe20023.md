 <p>1. Now at that time the Se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i of Râ<i>g</i>agaha had acquired a block <a name="fr_161"></a><a href="#fn_156"><font size="1">2</font></a> of sandal-wood of the most precious sandal-wood flavour. And the Se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i of Râ<i>g</i>agaha thought, 'How would it be if I were to have a bowl carved out of this block of sandal-wood, so that the chips <a name="fr_162"></a><a href="#fn_157"><font size="1">3</font></a> shall remain my property, and I can give the bowl away?' And the Se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i of Râ<i>g</i>agaha had a bowl turned out of that block of sandal-wood, and put it in a balance, and had it lifted on to the top of a bamboo <a name="fr_163"></a><a href="#fn_158"><font size="1">4</font></a>, and tying that bamboo at the top of a succession of bamboos, he let it be known, saying, 'If any Sama<i>n</i>a or Brahman be an Arahat and possessed of Iddhi, let him get down the bowl. It is a gift to him!'</p>  
 <p>Then Pûra<i>n</i>a Kassapa went to the Se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i of Râ<i>g</i>agaha, and said to him, 'I, O householder, am</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_79"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 79</font></a></p>  
 <p>an Arahat and possessed of Iddhi. Give me the bowl.'</p>  
 <p>'If, Sir, you are an Arahat and possessed of Iddhi, let your reverence get down the bowl!'</p>  
 <p>Then Makkhali Gosâla, and A<i>g</i>ita Kesa-kambalî, and Pakudha Ka<i>k</i><i>k</i>âyana, and Sa<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>aya Bela<i>t</i><i>th</i>iputta, and Niga<i>n</i><i>th</i>a Nâta-putta went severally to the Se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i of Râ<i>g</i>agaha, [and preferred the same request, and received the same reply.]</p>  
 <p>Now at that time the venerable Mahâ Moggallâna and the venerable Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ola Bhâradvâ<i>g</i>a, having dressed themselves early in the morning, went into Râ<i>g</i>agaha, duly bowled and robed, for alms. And the venerable Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ola Bhâradvâ<i>g</i>a said to the venerable Mahâ Moggallâna: 'The venerable Mahâ Moggallâna is both an Arahat and possessed of Iddhi. Go, friend Moggallâna, and fetch down this bowl, for this bowl belongs to thee.'</p>  
 <p>'The venerable Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ola Bhâradvâ<i>g</i>a also is both an Arahat and possessed of Iddhi. Go, friend Bhâradvâ<i>g</i>a, and fetch down the bowl, for this bowl belongs to thee.'</p>  
 <p>Then the venerable Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ola Bhâradvâ<i>g</i>a, rising up in the air, took the bowl, and went thrice round Râ<i>g</i>agaha (in the air). And at that time the Se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i of Râ<i>g</i>agaha stood in his dwelling-place with his wife and children, and holding up his clasped hands in reverent salutation, he exclaimed, 'May the venerable Bhâradvâ<i>g</i>a be pleased to descend upon our dwelling-place.' And the venerable Bhâradvâ<i>g</i>a descended into his dwelling-place. Then the Se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i of Râ<i>g</i>agaha took the bowl from the hands of the venerable Bhâradvâ<i>g</i>a, and filled it with costly food, and presented it to the venerable Bhâradvâ<i>g</i>a. And</p>  
 <p><a name="page_80"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 80</font></a></p>  
 <p>the venerable Bhâradvâ<i>g</i>a took the bowl, and departed to his Ârâma.</p>  
 <p>2. Now the people heard, 'The venerable Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ola Bhâradvâ<i>g</i>a, they say, has got down the Râ<i>g</i>agaha Se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's bowl.' And those people, with shouts loud and long, followed in the steps of Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ola Bhâradvâ<i>g</i>a. And the Blessed One heard the shouts loud and long, and on hearing them he asked the venerable Ânanda, 'What now, Ânanda, does this so great shouting mean?'</p>  
 <p>The venerable Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ola Bhâradvâ<i>g</i>a, Lord, has got down the Râ<i>g</i>agaha Se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's bowl; and the people thereof are following in his steps with shouts loud and long.'</p>  
 <p>Then the Blessed One, on that occasion and in that connection, convened a meeting of the Bhikkhu-Sa<i>m</i>gha, and asked Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ola Bhâradvâ<i>g</i>a, 'Is it true, as they say, that you, Bhâradvâ<i>g</i>a, have got down the Râ<i>g</i>agaha Se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's bowl?'</p>  
 <p>'It is true, Lord.'</p>  
 <p>The Blessed Buddha rebuked him, saying, 'This is improper, Bhâradvâ<i>g</i>a, not according to rule, unsuitable, unworthy of a Sama<i>n</i>a, unbecoming, and ought not to be done. How can you, Bhâradvâ<i>g</i>a, for the sake of a miserable wooden pot, display before the laity the superhuman quality of your miraculous power of Iddhi? Just, Bhâradvâ<i>g</i>a, like a woman who displays herself for the sake of a miserable piece of money <a name="fr_164"></a><a href="#fn_159"><font size="1">1</font></a>, have you, for the sake of a miserable</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_81"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 81</font></a></p>  
 <p>wooden pot displayed before the laity the superhuman quality of your miraculous power of Iddhi. This will not conduce, Bhâradvâ<i>g</i>a, either to the conversion of the unconverted, or to the increase of the converted; but rather to those who have not been converted remaining unconverted, and to the turning back of those who have been converted.'</p>  
 <p>And when he had rebuked him, and had delivered a religious discourse <a name="fr_165"></a><a href="#fn_160"><font size="1">1</font></a>, he addressed the Bhikkhus, and said: 'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to display before the laity the superhuman power of Iddhi. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<i>t</i>a <a name="fr_166"></a><a href="#fn_161"><font size="1">2</font></a>. Break to pieces, O Bhikkhus, that wooden bowl; and when you have ground it to powder, give it to the Bhikkhus as perfume for their eye ointments <a name="fr_167"></a><a href="#fn_162"><font size="1">3</font></a>. And you are not, O Bhikkhus, to use wooden bowls. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<i>t</i>a <a name="fr_168"></a><a href="#fn_163"><font size="1">4</font></a>.'</p>
