 <p>1. 'There are three cases, O Bhikkhus, in which grants of dispensation for those who are no longer insane are not valid: and three cases in which such grants are valid.</p>  
 <p>'What are the three cases in which grants of dispensation for those who are no longer insane are not valid?</p>  
 <p>'In the first place, O Bhikkhus, in case a Bhikkhu have committed an offence: and in respect thereof either the Sa<i>m</i>gha, or a number of Bhikkhus, or a single Bhikkhu, warn him, saying, "Does the venerable one call to mind that he has been guilty of such and such an offence?" And he, notwithstanding that he does remember it, says, "I do not remember, Sirs, that I have been guilty of such and such an offence." Then if the Sa<i>m</i>gha grant him the dispensation of those who are no longer insane, that grant is not valid.</p>  
 <p>'Again, O Bhikkhus, in case a Bhikkhu (&amp;c., as before, down to) And he, notwithstanding that he does remember it, says, "I remember it, Sirs, but as if in a dream." Then if the Sa<i>m</i>gha grant him</p>

 <p>the dispensation of those who are no longer insane, that grant is not valid.</p>  
 <p>Again, O Bhikkhus, in case a Bhikkhu have committed an offence, and in respect thereof either the Sa<i>m</i>gha, or a number of Bhikkhus, or a single Bhikkhu, warn him, saying, "Does the venerable one call to mind that he has been guilty of such and such an offence?" And he, though he is not insane, acts in the (deceptive) way of an insane person <a name="fr_37"></a><a href="#fn_36"><font size="1">1</font></a>, saying, "I act so, and you act so likewise. It beseems me, and it likewise beseems you." Then if the Sa<i>m</i>gha grant him the dispensation of those who are no longer insane, that grant is not valid.</p>  
 <p>These are the three cases, O Bhikkhus, in which a grant of the dispensation for those who are no longer insane is not valid.</p>  
 <p>2. 'What are the three cases in which grants of dispensation for those who are no longer insane are valid?</p>  
 <p>'In the first place, O Bhikkhus, in case a Bhikkhu be insane and out of his mind; and by him, when so insane and out of his mind, many things unworthy of a sama<i>n</i>a have been committed, as well in speech as in act. And either the Sa<i>m</i>gha, or a number of Bhikkhus, or a single Bhikkhu, warns him in respect thereof, saying, "Does the venerable one call to mind that he has committed such and such an offence?" And he really not remembering it, answers, "I do not remember, Sirs, that I have been guilty of such and such an offence." Then if the Sa<i>m</i>gha grants him the dispensation for those who are no longer insane, that grant is valid.</p>

Then if the Sa<i>m</i>gha grants him the dispensation for those who are no longer insane, that grant is valid.</p>  
 <p>'Again, O Bhikkhus, in case a Bhikkhu be insane and out of his mind (&amp;c., as before, down to) "Does the venerable one call to mind that he has been guilty of such and such an offence?" And he, being still insane, acts in the way of an insane person, saying, "I act so, and you act so likewise. It beseems me, and it likewise beseems you." Then if the Sa<i>m</i>gha (afterwards) grant him the dispensation for those who are no longer insane, that grant is valid.</p>  
 <p>'These are the three cases, O Bhikkhus, in which the grant of the dispensation for those who are no longer insane is valid.'</p>
