 <p>1. Now at that time, while the Bhikkhus were continuing in quarrels, strifes, and disputes, they had been guilty of many things unworthy of a Sama<i>n</i>a, as well in word as in deed, and it occurred to the Bhikkhus, 'Whilst we were continuing, &amp;c. . . . we have been guilty, &amp;c. . . . as well in word as in deed. If we now deal one with another for those offences, it may happen that that proceeding may result in harshness, in ill-feeling, in divisions. How now should we manage?'</p>  
 <p>And they told the matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>In case, O Bhikkhus, whilst the Bhikkhus are continuing, &amp;c. . . . they are guilty, &amp;c. . . . as well in word as in deed. And it occurs to them, "Whilst we were continuing, &amp;c. . . . we have been guilty, &amp;c. . . . If we now deal, &amp;c. . . . How now shall</p>

 <p><a name="page_32"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 32</font></a></p>  
 <p>we manage?" I enjoin upon you, O Bhikkhus, to settle a matter of this kind by Ti<i>n</i>avatthâraka (the Covering over as with grass) <a name="fr_62"></a><a href="#fn_61"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>2. 'And thus, O Bhikkhus, is it to be settled. All are to meet together in one spot. When they have met together some able and discreet Bhikkhu is to bring the matter before the Sa<i>m</i>gha, saying,</p>  
 <p>'"Let the venerable Sa<i>m</i>gha hear me. While we were continuing, &amp;c. . . . we have been guilty, &amp;c. . . . as well in word as in deed. And it occurred to us (&amp;c., down to) If we now deal one with another, &amp;c. . . . it may result in harshness, in ill-feeling, in divisions. If the time seems meet to the Sa<i>m</i>gha; let the Sa<i>m</i>gha settle this matter by the Covering over as with grass--except only as regards serious offences <a name="fr_63"></a><a href="#fn_62"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and as regards those things in which the laity have been concerned."</p>  
 <p>'Then some discreet and able Bhikkhu among those Bhikkhus who belong to the one party is to bring the matter before his own party, saying,</p>  
 <p>'"May the venerable ones hear me. While we were continuing, &amp;c. . . . we have been guilty, &amp;c. . . . as well in word as in deed. And it occurred to us, &amp;c. . . . (down to) in divisions. If the time seems meet to you, venerable Sirs, I would confess in the midst of the Sa<i>m</i>gha, both on your behalf, venerable Sirs, and on my own behalf, both such offence as is yours, venerable Sirs, and such offence</p>

 <p><a name="page_33"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 33</font></a></p>  
 <p>as is mine own, to the end that it may be covered over as with grass, except only as regards serious offences, and as regards those things in which the laity have been concerned."</p>  
 <p>'And some discreet and able Bhikkhu among the Bhikkhus belonging to the other party is to bring the matter before his own party, saying, "May the venerable ones hear me [&amp;c., as before in the last paragraph, down to the end]."</p>  
 <p>Then the discreet and able Bhikkhu among the Bhikkhus belonging to the one party is to bring the matter before the Sa<i>m</i>gha, saying, "May the venerable Sa<i>m</i>gha hear me. While we (&amp;c., as before, down to) in divisions. If the time seems meet to the Sa<i>m</i>gha, I would confess <a name="fr_64"></a><a href="#fn_63"><font size="1">1</font></a> in the midst of the Sa<i>m</i>gha, both on behalf of these venerable ones and on my own behalf, both such offence as is theirs and such offence as is mine own, to the end that it may be covered over as with grass, except only as regards serious offences, and as regards those things in which the laity have been concerned. This is the motion Patti). May the venerable Sa<i>m</i>gha hear me. While we (&amp;c., as before, down to) in divisions. I confess (&amp;c., as before, down to) in which the laity have been concerned. Whosoever of the venerable ones approves of the confession of these our offences, to the end that they may so be covered over as with grass, except as before mentioned, let him keep silence. Whosoever approves not thereof, let him speak. These our offences are confessed in the midst of the Sa<i>m</i>gha, to the end that they may be covered over as with grass, except</p>

 <p><a name="page_34"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 34</font></a></p>  
 <p>as before mentioned. The Sa<i>m</i>gha approves thereof. Therefore is it silent. Thus do I understand."</p>  
 <p>'And the discreet and able Bhikkhu among the Bhikkhus belonging to the other party is to bring the matter before the Sa<i>m</i>gha, saying, "Let the venerable Sa<i>m</i>gha hear me (&amp;c., as before in the last paragraph, down to the end)."</p>  
 <p>'Then thus, O Bhikkhus, those Bhikkhus are absolved of those offences, except as regards serious offences, and as regards those things in which the laity have been concerned, and except also as regards those who express their disapproval of the proceedings, or who are not present at them <a name="fr_65"></a><a href="#fn_64"><font size="1">1</font></a>.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_60"></a><a href="sbe20014.htm#fr_61">31:1</a> The whole of this chapter recurs below, IV, 14, 33.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_61"></a><a href="sbe20014.htm#fr_62">32:1</a> Buddhaghosa's commentary on this expression will be found in the notes to H.O.'s edition of the text, pp. 313, 314.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_62"></a><a href="sbe20014.htm#fr_63">32:2</a> Buddhaghosa (H.O. loc. cit.) explains this as meaning either Pârâ<i>g</i>ika or Sa<i>m</i>ghâdisesa offences. So also he explains Du<i>t</i><i>th</i>ullâ âpatti at Mahâvagga X, 5, 4.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_63"></a><a href="sbe20014.htm#fr_64">33:1</a> Deseyya<i>m</i>. Compare IV, 14, 33, at the end.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_64"></a><a href="sbe20014.htm#fr_65">34:1</a> On these phrases Buddhaghosa has the following note Di<i>t</i><i>th</i>âvikamman ti ye pana na me ta<i>m</i> khamatî ti a<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>ama<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>â di<i>t</i><i>th</i>âvikamma<i>m</i> karonti tehi vâ saddhi<i>m</i> âpatti<i>m</i> âpa<i>g</i><i>g</i>itvâ pi, tattha anâgatâ âgantvâ vâ <i>kh</i>anda<i>m</i> datvâ parive<i>n</i>âdisu nisinnâ, te âpattîhi na vu<i>t</i><i>th</i>ahanti. This is more an exegesis on the rule than an explanation of the words Di<i>t</i><i>th</i>âvikamma<i>m</i> <i>th</i>apetvâ, the exact meaning of which remains doubtful. The literal rendering would be 'except as regards the manifestation of opinion.'</p>
