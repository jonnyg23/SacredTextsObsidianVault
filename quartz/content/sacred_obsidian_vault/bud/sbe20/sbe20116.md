 <p>1. Now at that time a certain woman who had already conceived, but did not know it, was received into the Order among the Bhikkhunîs. Afterwards her womb moved within her <a name="fr_952"></a><a href="#fn_936"><font size="1">2</font></a>. Then that Bhikkhunî thought: 'How shall I now conduct myself towards this child?'</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow her, O Bhikkhus, to bring it up till it have attained to years of discretion <a name="fr_953"></a><a href="#fn_937"><font size="1">3</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>Then the Bhikkhunî thought: 'It is not permissible for me to live alone, nor for any other Bhikkhunî to live with a male child. What course ought I to pursue?'</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow the Bhikkhunîs, O Bhikkhus, to depute any one Bhikkhunî, and give her as a companion to that (first-mentioned) Bhikkhunî.'</p>

 <p>'And thus, O Bhikkhus, is she <i>t</i>o be appointed: First that Bhikkhunî ought to be asked (whether she be willing to undertake the duty). After she has been asked, a learned and competent Bhikkhunî ought to lay the motion before the Sa<i>m</i>gha, saying:</p>  
 <p>'"Let the Sa<i>m</i>gha, venerable Ladies, hear me. If it seem meet to the Sa<i>m</i>gha, let the Sa<i>m</i>gha depute N. N. as a companion to M. M. That is the motion.</p>  
 <p>'"Let the Sa<i>m</i>gha,"' [&amp;c., as usual, to the end of the Kammavâ<i>k</i>â.]</p>  
 <p>2. Then that companion Bhikkhunî thought: 'Now how should I conduct myself towards this child?'</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I prescribe that the Bhikkhunîs, O Bhikkhus, conduct themselves towards that child precisely as they would towards other men, save only as regards the sleeping under the same roof <a name="fr_954"></a><a href="#fn_938"><font size="1">1</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>3. Now at that time a certain Bhikkhunî, who had been guilty of a grievous offence, was living subject to the Mânatta penance <a name="fr_955"></a><a href="#fn_939"><font size="1">2</font></a>. Then that Bhikkhunî thought: 'It is not permissible for me to live alone, and it is not permissible for any other Bhikkhunî to live with me. What now ought I to do?'</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>I allow the Bhikkhunîs, O Bhikkhus, to depute any one Bhikkhunî, and to give her as a companion to that Bhikkhunî. And thus, O Bhikkhus, ought</p>
