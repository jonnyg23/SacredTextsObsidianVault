 <p>1. Now at that time the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus set the woods on fire.</p>  
 <p>People murmured, &amp;c., saying, 'Like the charcoal burners.'</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to set woods on fire. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<i>t</i>a.'</p>  
 <p>Now at that time the Vihâras were hidden under masses of grass <a name="fr_411"></a><a href="#fn_403"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and when the woods were set on fire the Vihâras were burnt. The Bhikkhus, fearing to offend, would not make a counter-fire for their own protection.</p>

 <p>2. Now at that time the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus climbed up trees, and jumped from tree to tree.</p>  
 <p>People murmured, &amp;c., saying, 'Like monkeys.</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to climb up trees. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<i>t</i>a.'</p>  
 <p>Now at that time, when a certain Bhikkhu in the Kosala country was going to Sâvatthi, an elephant pursued him on the way. And that Bhikkhu, when he had run up to the foot of a tree, fearing to offend, did not climb up. The elephant passed on another way.</p>  
 <p>That Bhikkhu, on arriving at Sâvatthi, told this matter to the Bhikkhus (and the Bhikkhus told this matter to the Blessed One <a name="fr_413"></a><a href="#fn_405"><font size="1">2</font></a>).</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, when there shall be something to be done to ascend a tree to the height of a man; and in cases of misfortune as high as you like.'</p>
