 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Sâvatthi, went to a certain country-place where a community of the Sa<i>m</i>gha resided, and there also had a lodging allotted to him. Then the Bhikkhus there thought, 'Now this brother, Upananda the Sâkyan, is a maker of strife, quarrelsome, a maker of disputes, given to idle talk, a raiser of legal questions in the Sa<i>m</i>gha <a name="fr_592"></a><a href="#fn_582"><font size="1">1</font></a>. If he should spend the rainy season here, then shall we all dwell in discomfort. Come, let us question him.' And they asked the venerable Upananda the Sâkyan:</p>  
 <p>'Have not you, friend Upananda, had a lodging allotted to you in Sâvatthi?'</p>  
 <p>That is so, Sirs.'</p>  
 <p>'What then do you, friend Upananda, being one, yet take exclusive possession of two (lodging-places)?'</p>  
 <p>'Well, I do now, Sirs, set (the lodging) here free, and take the one there.'</p>

 <p>'Is it true, Upananda, that you, being one, have taken possession of two places?'</p>  
 <p>'It is true, Lord.'</p>  
 <p>Then the Blessed One rebuked him, saying, 'How can you, O foolish one, do such a thing? What you took there, O foolish one, has been lost here; what you took here, has been lost there <a name="fr_593"></a><a href="#fn_583"><font size="1">2</font></a>. Thus, O</p>

 <p>foolish one, you are deprived of both.' And when he had delivered a religious discourse, he said to the Bhikkhus:</p>  
 <p>'One man is not, O Bhikkhus, to take two lodging-places. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<i>t</i>a.'</p>
