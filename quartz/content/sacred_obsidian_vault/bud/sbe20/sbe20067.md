 <p>1. Now at that time the Bhikkhus who dwelt in a certain country residence, not far from Sâvatthi, were worried by having constantly to provide sleeping accommodation for travelling Bhikkhus who came in (from country-places). And those Bhikkhus</p>  
 <p><a name="page_210"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 210</font></a></p>  
 <p>thought: '[This being so,] let us hand over all the sleeping accommodation which is the property of the Sa<i>m</i>gha to one (of us), and let us use it as belonging to him.' And they [did so <a name="fr_601"></a><a href="#fn_591"><font size="1">1</font></a>].</p>  
 <p>Then the incoming Bhikkhus said to them: 'Prepare, Sirs, sleeping accommodation for us.'</p>  
 <p>'There are no beds, Sirs, belonging to the Sa<i>m</i>gha. We have given them all away to one of us.'</p>  
 <p>'What, Sirs? Have you then made away with property belonging to the Sa<i>m</i>gha?'</p>  
 <p>'That is so, Sirs.'</p>  
 <p>The moderate Bhikkhus murmured, &amp;c., and told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'Is it true, O Bhikkhus, .as they say, that Bhikkhus make away with Sa<i>m</i>gha property?'</p>  
 <p>'It is true, Lord.'</p>  
 <p>2. Then the Blessed One rebuked them, &amp;c., and said to the Bhikkhus: 'These five things, O Bhikkhus, are untransferable; and are not to be disposed of either by the Sa<i>m</i>gha, or by a company of two or three Bhikkhus (a Ga<i>n</i>a), or by a single individual. And what are the five? A park (Ârâma), or the site for a park--this is the first untransferable thing, that cannot be disposed of by the Sa<i>m</i>gha, or by a Ga<i>n</i>a, or by an individual. If it be disposed of, such disposal is void; and whosoever has disposed of it, is guilty of a thulla<i>k</i><i>k</i>aya. A Vihâra, or the site for a Vihâra--this is the second, &amp;c. (as before). A bed, or a chair, or a bolster, or a -pillow--this is the third, &amp;c. A brass vessel, or a brass jar, or a brass pot, or a brass vase, or a razor, or an axe, or a</p>

 <p>hatchet, or a hoe, or a spade--this is the fourth, &amp;c. Creepers, or bamboos, or mu<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>a, or babba<i>g</i>a grass, or common grass, or clay, or things made of wood, or crockery--this is the fifth, &amp;c. (as before, down to) thulla<i>k</i><i>k</i>aya.'</p>
