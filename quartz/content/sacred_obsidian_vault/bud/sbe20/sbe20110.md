 <p>'A Bhikkhunî is not, O Bhikkhus, to omit holding Pavâra<i>n</i>â. Whosoever does so, shall be dealt with according to law <a name="fr_930"></a><a href="#fn_916"><font size="1">1</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>Now at that time the Bhikkhunîs held Pavâra<i>n</i>â by themselves, and not in the Bhikkhu-sa<i>m</i>gha.</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'A Bhikkhunî is not, O Bhikkhus, to hold Pavâra<i>n</i>â apart, and not in the Bhikkhu-sa<i>m</i>gha. Whosoever does so, shall be dealt with according to law <a name="fr_931"></a><a href="#fn_917"><font size="1">2</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>Now at that time Bhikkhunîs holding Pavâra<i>n</i>â with the Bhikkhus only, and not apart by themselves, disturbed (the meeting of the Bhikkhu-sa<i>m</i>gha).</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>

 <p>before noon holding Pavâra<i>n</i>â [and so had no time left for the early meal].</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that they hold Pavâra<i>n</i>â in the afternoon.'</p>  
 <p>When holding Pavâra<i>n</i>â in the afternoon, they had not time enough [to conclude their own ceremony that day, and take part in that of the Bhikkhus].</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow them, O Bhikkhus, to hold their own Pavâra<i>n</i>â one day, and that with the Bhikkhus the next day.'</p>  
 <p>2. Now at that time the whole of the Bhikkhunî-sa<i>m</i>gha declaring, each one for herself, her Pavâra<i>n</i>â before the Bhikkhu-sa<i>m</i>gha, disturbed (the proceedings).</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that some one learned and competent Bhikkhunî be deputed to make the Pavâra<i>n</i>â invitation on behalf of the Bhikkhunî-sa<i>m</i>gha before the Bhikkhu-sa<i>m</i>gha. And thus, O Bhikkhus, is she to be deputed:</p>  
 <p>'"First, the Bhikkhunî is to be asked (whether she be willing to serve). When that has been done, a learned and discreet Bhikkhunî is to lay this motion before the Sa<i>m</i>gha: Let the Sa<i>m</i>gha, venerable Ladies, hear me. If it seem meet to the Sa<i>m</i>gha, let the Sa<i>m</i>gha depute N. N. to make the Pavâra<i>n</i>â invitation on behalf of the Bhikkhunî-sa<i>m</i>gha before the Bhikkhu-sa<i>m</i>gha. That is the motion.</p>  
 <p>'"Let the Sa<i>m</i>gha, venerable Ladies, hear me. The Sa<i>m</i>gha deputes N. N. to make the Pavâra<i>n</i>â invitation on behalf of the Bhikkhunî-sa<i>m</i>gha before the Bhikkhu-sa<i>m</i>gha. Whosoever of the venerable</p>  
 <p><a name="page_358"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 358</font></a></p>  
 <p>ones approves thereof, let her keep silence. Whosoever approves not thereof, let her speak.</p>  
 <p>'"N. N. is deputed by the Sa<i>m</i>gha to make the Pavâra<i>n</i>â invitation on behalf of the Bhikkhunî-sa<i>m</i>gha before the Bhikkhu-sa<i>m</i>gha. The Sa<i>m</i>gha approves thereof. Therefore is it silent. Thus do I understand."'</p>  
 <p>3. 'When that Bhikkhunî has been deputed, she, accompanied by the Bhikkhunî-sa<i>m</i>gha, is to go before the Bhikkhu-sa<i>m</i>gha, arrange her robe over one shoulder, bow down before the Bhikkhus, and sitting on her heels, to stretch forth her joined palms, and say: "The Bhikkhunî-sa<i>m</i>gha invites the Bhikkhu-sa<i>m</i>gha (to point out to them any faults they may have committed) in respect of things heard, or seen, or suspected. May the Bhikkhu-sa<i>m</i>gha speak to the Bhikkhunî-sa<i>m</i>gha (if there be anything wherein they have offended) out of compassion toward them. Then will they, if they perceive the offence, confess the same. And a second time the Bhikkhunî-sa<i>m</i>gha . . . . . . [the whole repeated]. And a third time . . . . . .
