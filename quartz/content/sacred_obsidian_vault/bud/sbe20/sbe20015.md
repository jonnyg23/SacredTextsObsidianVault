 <p>1. Now at that time Bhikkhus had disputes with Bhikkhus, and Bhikkhunîs with Bhikkhus. And the Bhikkhu <i>Kh</i>anna <a name="fr_66"></a><a href="#fn_65"><font size="1">2</font></a>, forcing his way (into the apartments) of the Bhikkhunîs took the part of the Bhikkhunîs <a name="fr_67"></a><a href="#fn_66"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and disputed with the Bhikkhus.</p>  
 <p>

 <p>Those Bhikkhus who were moderate were indignant, &amp;c. . . . told the Blessed One, &amp;c. . . . he addressed the Bhikkhus, and said:</p>  
 <p>2. 'There are, O Bhikkhus, the following four kinds of legal questions that require formal settlement by the Sa<i>m</i>gha; (that is to say), legal questions arising out of disputes, legal questions arising out of censure, legal questions arising out of offences, legal questions arising out of business <a name="fr_68"></a><a href="#fn_67"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>'Among these, what is a legal question arising out of dispute? This, O Bhikkhus, is when Bhikkhus dispute, saying, "This is Dhamma," or "This is not Dhamma," or "This is Vinaya," or "This is not Vinaya," or "This is taught and spoken by the Tathâgata," or "This is not taught nor spoken by the Tathâgata," or "This has been practised by the Tathâgata," or "This has not been practised by the Tathâgata," or "This has been ordained by the Tathâgata," or "This has not been ordained by the Tathâgata," or "This is an offence," or "This is not an offence," or "This is a slight offence," or "This is a grievous offence," or "This is an offence which can be done away," or "This is an offence which cannot be done away <a name="fr_69"></a><a href="#fn_68"><font size="1">2</font></a>," or "This is a most grave offence," or "This is not a most grave</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_36"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 36</font></a></p>  
 <p>offence." Whatsoever quarrel, strife, controversy, difference of opinion, contradiction, opposition, cantankerousness <a name="fr_70"></a><a href="#fn_69"><font size="1">1</font></a>, or contention there may be on such a matter, this is called a legal question arising out of dispute.</p>  
 <p>'And among these, which is a legal question arising out of censure? This, O Bhikkhu, is when Bhikkhus charge a Bhikkhu with a fault of morality, or of conduct, or of opinion, or of means of livelihood. Whatsoever charge, censure, incrimination <a name="fr_71"></a><a href="#fn_70"><font size="1">2</font></a>, admonition <a name="fr_72"></a><a href="#fn_70"><font size="1">2</font></a>, candid opinion <a name="fr_73"></a><a href="#fn_71"><font size="1">3</font></a>, making of excuses <a name="fr_74"></a><a href="#fn_72"><font size="1">4</font></a> for a person, or making fun of him, there may be, that is called a legal question arising out of censure.</p>  
 <p>'And among these, what is a legal question arising out of offence? The five groups of offences <a name="fr_75"></a><a href="#fn_73"><font size="1">5</font></a> are subjects of legal questions of offences, and the seven groups of offences <a name="fr_76"></a><a href="#fn_74"><font size="1">6</font></a> are subjects of legal questions of offence. This is what is called a legal question arising out of offence.</p>  
 <p>'And among these, what is a legal question of business? Whatsoever is to the Sa<i>m</i>gha a matter which ought to be done, an obligation, a matter for which leave ought to be formally asked, the proposal</p>

 <p><a name="page_37"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 37</font></a></p>  
 <p>of a resolution <a name="fr_77"></a><a href="#fn_75"><font size="1">1</font></a>, the proceeding by is a <i>ñ</i>atti-dutiya-kamma <a name="fr_78"></a><a href="#fn_76"><font size="1">2</font></a>, or by <i>ñ</i>atti-<i>k</i>atuttha-kamma <a name="fr_79"></a><a href="#fn_76"><font size="1">2</font></a>, that is called a legal question of business.</p>  
 <p>3. 'What is that which gives rise to a legal question of dispute? There are six causes of dispute that give rise to legal questions of dispute. And there are three causes of wrong-doing that give rise to legal questions of dispute, and three causes of right-doing that give rise to legal questions of dispute. And which are these six?</p>  
 <p>'In the first place, O Bhikkhus, there is the Bhikkhu who is angry, and who bears enmity in his heart. Whatsoever Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, is such an angry man bearing enmity in his heart, he remains without reverence for, and without delight in the Teacher, the Dhamma, and the Sa<i>m</i>gha, and does not fulfil all the duties of a disciple. And whatsoever Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, remains without reverence for, and without delight in the Teacher, the Dhamma, and the Sa<i>m</i>gha, and does not fulfil all the duties of a disciple, he causes disputes to arise in the Sa<i>m</i>gha, and such a dispute becomes a cause</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_38"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 38</font></a></p>  
 <p>of woe, and of want, and of disaster to the great multitudes, of woe and of want to gods and men. If you, therefore, O Bhikkhus, perceive such a one, a root of disputes both internal and external, do you exert yourselves, O Bhikkhus, to put away from you so evil a person, the root of those disputes. If you perceive, O Bhikkhus, no such person, take pains lest any such evil root of disputes should thereafter arise among you. Thus will so evil a root of disputes be put away from you, and thus will no such evil person, the root of. disputes, arise hereafter among you.</p>  
 <p>'Again, O Bhikkhus, there is the Bhikkhu, who is a hypocrite <a name="fr_80"></a><a href="#fn_77"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and who hides his faults; who is envious and jealous; who is crafty and treacherous; who has sinful desires and false beliefs; who is tarnished by love of worldly gain, devoted to getting and taking, for whom to renounce a thing is hard. Whatsoever Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, is thus a hypocrite, who hides his faults, he remains [&amp;c., as before, the whole of the last paragraph down to the end being repeated in each of the cases here enumerated].</p>  
 <p>4. 'And which are the three causes of wrong-doing which give rise to legal questions of dispute?</p>  
 <p>'Herein, O Bhikkhus, men of greedy mind are given to dispute, men of evil mind are given to dispute, men of foolish mind are given to dispute, saying, "This is Dhamma," or "This is not Dhamma" [&amp;c., as before, in § 2, down to] or "This is not a</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_39"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 39</font></a></p>  
 <p>most grave offence." These are the three causes of wrong-doing which give rise to legal questions of dispute.</p>  
 <p>'And which are the three causes of right-doing which give rise to legal questions of dispute?</p>  
 <p>'In the first place, O Bhikkhus, men not of greedy mind [&amp;c., as in the last paragraph, inserting the word "not"].</p>  
 <p>5. 'And what is that, O Bhikkhus, which gives rise to legal questions of censure? There are six causes of censure that give rise to legal questions of censure. And there are three causes of wrong-doing that give rise to legal questions of censure. And there are three causes of right-doing that give rise to legal questions of censure. And the body gives rise to legal questions of censure, and speech gives rise to legal questions of censure.'</p>  
 <p>[The six are word for word the same as in the last section, reading 'censure' for 'dispute.']</p>  
 <p>'And which are the three causes of wrong-doing that give rise to legal questions of censure?</p>  
 <p>'Herein, O Bhikkhus, men of greedy mind are given to censure, men of evil mind are given to censure, men of foolish mind are given to censure, accusing others of breaches of morality, or of behaviour, or of error in doctrine, or of adopting a wrong means of livelihood. These are the three causes of wrong-doing that give rise to legal questions of censure.'</p>  
 <p>[There follow the three causes of right-doing, reading 'men not of greedy mind,' &amp;c., as before, end of § 4.]</p>  
 <p>And how does the body give rise to legal questions of censure? In case a man be ill-favoured,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_40"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 40</font></a></p>  
 <p>or ugly, or a dwarf <a name="fr_81"></a><a href="#fn_78"><font size="1">1</font></a>, or diseased, or blind of one eye, or lame, or humpbacked, or crippled, people find fault with him on that account. This is how the body gives rise to legal questions of censure.</p>  
 <p>'And how does speech give rise to legal questions of censure? In case a man have a bad voice, or be indistinct, or harsh in speech <a name="fr_82"></a><a href="#fn_79"><font size="1">2</font></a>, then people find fault with him on that account. This is how speech gives rise to legal questions of censure.</p>  
 <p>6. 'And what is it that gives rise to legal questions of offence? There are six origins of offence that give rise to legal questions of offence. There is an offence that originates in deed, but not in word nor in thought. There is an offence that originates in word, but not in deed nor in thought. There is an offence that originates in deed and in word, but not in thought. There is an offence that originates in deed and in thought, but not in word. There is an offence that originates in word and in thought, but not in deed. There is an offence that originates in deed and in word and in thought. These are the six (&amp;c.)</p>  
 <p>7. 'And what is that which gives rise to legal questions of business? There is one thing that gives rise to legal questions of business, that is to say, the Sa<i>m</i>gha.</p>

 <p>8. 'Legal questions of dispute. Right. Wrong. Undetermined <a name="fr_83"></a><a href="#fn_80"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>'A legal question arising out of dispute may be right, and it may be wrong, and it may be undetermined. Of these, which is the legal question arising out of dispute which is right?</p>  
 <p>'In case, O Bhikkhus, the Bhikkhu of right mind discuss, saying, "This is the Dhamma," or "This is not the Dhamma" (&amp;c., as before, in § 2, down to) or "This is not a most grave offence." Whatsoever quarrel, strife, contention, difference of opinion, contradiction, opposition, cantankerousness, or contention there may be in such a discussion is called a legal question arising out of dispute that is right.'</p>  
 <p>[And so when the Bhikkhus have a wrong mind, or an undetermined mind, the legal question arising out of such dispute is respectively a legal question arising out of dispute that is wrong or undetermined.]</p>  
 <p>9. 'Legal questions of censure. Right. Wrong. Undetermined.'</p>  
 <p>[It may be either of the three, according as the Bhikkhus censuring (as in § 5) have a right, wrong, or an undetermined mind. The form of the paragraph corresponds to § 8 throughout.]</p>  
 <p>10. 'Legal questions of offence. Right. Wrong. Undetermined.</p>  
 <p>There may be a legal question whether an offence is wrong, and there may be a legal question</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_42"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 42</font></a></p>  
 <p>whether an offence is undetermined. There is no legal question whether an offence be right.</p>  
 <p>'Of these, which is a legal question whether an offence be wrong? Whatsoever transgression be committed knowingly, consciously, and deliberately, this is called a legal question whether an offence be wrong.</p>  
 <p>'And of these, which is a legal question whether an offence be undetermined? Whatsoever transgression be committed not knowingly, not consciously, not deliberately, this is called a legal question whether an offence be undetermined.</p>  
 <p>11. 'Legal questions of business. Right. Wrong. Undetermined.'</p>  
 <p>[It maybe all three, according as the Bhikkhus performing the business specified, as in § 2, are right-minded, wrong-minded, or of undetermined mind. The form of the paragraph as in § 8 throughout.]</p>  
 <p>12. 'Disputes, legal questions arising out of disputes. Dispute which is no legal question. Legal question which is no dispute. Matter which is both legal question and dispute.</p>  
 <p>'There may be a dispute which is a legal question of dispute. There may be a dispute which is no legal question. There may be such a legal question which is no dispute. There may be such a legal question and also a dispute.</p>  
 <p>Of these, which is the dispute which is a legal question of dispute requiring formal settlement? In case Bhikkhus discuss, saying, "This is Dhamma" [&amp;c., as before, in § 2], or "This is not a most grave offence." Whatsoever quarrel, strife [&amp;c., as in § 2] there may be on such a matter is a dispute which is a legal question of dispute requiring formal settlement.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_43"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 43</font></a></p>  
 <p>'And of these, which is a dispute which is not a legal question requiring formal settlement? When a mother disputes with her son, or a son with his mother, or a father with his son, or a son with his father, or a brother with a brother, or a brother with a sister, or a sister with a brother, or a friend with a friend. Such a dispute is not a legal question requiring formal settlement by the Sa<i>m</i>gha.</p>  
 <p>'And of these, which is a legal question that is not a dispute? A legal question of censure, or a legal question of offence, or a legal question of business. This is a legal question which is not a dispute.</p>  
 <p>'And of these, which is a legal question requiring formal settlement which is also a dispute? A legal question of dispute that requires formal settlement by the Sa<i>m</i>gha is both such a legal question and also a dispute.'</p>  
 <p>13. [The same distinction drawn between censure, and a legal question of censure requiring formal settlement.]</p>  
 <p>14. 'Offence. Legal question arising out of an offence. Offence which is not subject of a legal question. Legal question and no offence. Legal question and offence too.</p>  
 <p>'There may be an offence which is subject of a legal question of offence. There may be an offence and no legal question. There may be legal question and no offence. There may be legal question and offence too.</p>  
 <p>Of these, which is the offence which may be subject of a legal question? The five groups of offences are subjects of legal questions of offence; the seven groups of offences are subjects of legal questions of offence. These are offences which may be subject of a legal question.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_44"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 44</font></a></p>  
 <p>And of these, which is an offence (Âpatti) which is not subject of a legal question? Conversion, higher attainment (sot-âpatti, sam-âpatti), these are âpattis which are not subjects of a legal question <a name="fr_84"></a><a href="#fn_81"><font size="1">1</font></a>. These are âpattis not subjects of a legal question.</p>  
 <p>'And of these, what is the legal question where there is no offence? A legal question of official duty, a legal question of censure, a legal question of dispute. These are legal questions where there may be no offence.</p>  
 <p>'And of these, which is the case in which there is both a legal question and an offence too? A legal question regarding an offence is a case in which there is both a legal question and an offence too.</p>

 <p>16. 'But by what kind of settlements is a legal question arising out of dispute brought to settlement? By two kinds of settlement, by the Proceeding in presence <a name="fr_86"></a><a href="#fn_83"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and by the Proceeding by majority of the Sa<i>m</i>gha <a name="fr_87"></a><a href="#fn_84"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>'If one should ask, "Can it be that a legal question arising out of dispute without recourse having been had to the one mode of settlement--to wit, the Proceeding by majority of the Sa<i>m</i>gha--can it be that it may be settled by the other mode of settlement, to wit, by the Proceeding in presence?"

 <p>the case when the Bhikkhus dispute, saying, 'This is the Dhamma,' or 'This is not the Dhamma' (&amp;c., as before, in § 2, down to), or 'This is not a most grave offence.'" If, O Bhikkhus, those Bhikkhus, are able to settle their own dispute, that is called, O Bhikkhus, the settlement of the dispute.</p>  
 <p>' <a name="fr_88"></a><a href="#fn_85"><font size="1">1</font></a>And how has it been settled? By the Proceeding in presence.</p>  
 <p>'And what must there be in such a Proceeding in presence? There must be the presence of the Sa<i>m</i>gha, the presence of the Dhamma, the presence of the Vinaya, and the presence of the particular person.</p>  
 <p>'And therein, what is the presence of the Sa<i>m</i>gha? As many Bhikkhus as are capable of taking part in the proceeding <a name="fr_89"></a><a href="#fn_86"><font size="1">2</font></a>, they must be present. The formal consent must be produced of those who are in a fit state to convey their consent <a name="fr_90"></a><a href="#fn_87"><font size="1">3</font></a>. Those who are present must have lodged no objection (against any one of them taking part in the proceeding) <a name="fr_91"></a><a href="#fn_88"><font size="1">4</font></a>. This is the "presence" in such a matter of the Sa<i>m</i>gha.</p>  
 <p>'And of these, what is the presence of the Dhamma, and the presence of the Vinaya? The Dhamma, and the Vinaya, and the teaching of the Master by the aid of which that legal question is settled. That is the "presence" in such a matter of the Dhamma, and of the Vinaya.</p>

 <p>'When a legal question, O Bhikkhus, has beer. thus settled, if a disputant re-open the question, such re-opening of the question is a Pâ<i>k</i>ittiya <a name="fr_92"></a><a href="#fn_89"><font size="1">1</font></a>. If one who has conveyed his consent complain of the decision, such complaint is a Pâ<i>k</i>ittiya <a name="fr_93"></a><a href="#fn_90"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>17. 'If those Bhikkhus, O Bhikkhus, are not able to settle the legal question within their own residence (Âvâsa), those Bhikkhus should go, O Bhikkhus, to some residence in which there are a larger number of Bhikkhus. Then if those Bhikkhus, O Bhikkhus, should succeed, whilst on their way to that residence, in settling the legal question, that, O Bhikkhus, is called a settlement of it. And how has it been settled? (&amp;c., as in the last paragraph of the previous section, down to the end.)</p>  
 <p>18. 'If those Bhikkhus are not able, O Bhikkhus, to settle the legal question whilst they are on their way to that residence, then those Bhikkhus, on their arrival at that residence, are to address the Bhikkhus at that residence thus: "Such and such a legal question, Sirs, has arisen thus, and has been carried on thus amongst us. It would be well if you, Sirs, would settle that legal question for us according to the Dhamma, and according to the Vinaya, and according to the teaching of the Master, to the end that that legal question may be thoroughly settled."

 <p>are the senior, and the incoming Bhikkhus are junior, then the Bhikkhus dwelling in that residence are, O Bhikkhus, to address the incoming Bhikkhus thus: "Pray, Sirs, rest a moment apart until we take counsel together!" If, on the other hand, the Bhikkhus dwelling in that residence are junior, and the incoming Bhikkhus are senior, then the Bhikkhus dwelling in that residence are, O Bhikkhus, to address the incoming Bhikkhus thus: "Then remain here, Sirs, a moment until we take counsel together." Then if, O Bhikkhus, the Bhikkhus dwelling in that residence should, on consideration, think thus: "We shall not be able to settle this legal question according to the Dhamma, and according to the Vinaya, and according to the teaching of the Master," then that dispute is not to be entrusted to them. If, on the other hand, O Bhikkhus, the Bhikkhus dwelling in that residence should, on consideration, think thus: "We shall be able to settle this legal question in accordance with the Dhamma, and in accordance with the Vinaya, and in accordance with the teaching of the Master," then, O Bhikkhus, the Bhikkhus dwelling in that residence are to address the incoming Bhikkhus thus: "If you, Sirs, let us know about this legal question, how it arose, and how it was carried on, and if you agree that in the manner in which we may settle the legal question according to the Dhamma, and according to the Vinaya, and according to the teaching of the Master, in that manner it shall be settled, then we will thus accept the legal question at your hands. But if not (&amp;c., the whole being repeated), then we will not accept it." When they have thus, O Bhikkhus, brought</p>  
 <p><a name="page_49"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 49</font></a></p>  
 <p>it about that the proper way of putting the legal question (the point at issue) has been settled, the Bhikkhus dwelling in that residence should undertake that legal question. And then the Bhikkhus dwelling in that residence should be addressed, O Bhikkhus, by the incoming Bhikkhus thus: "We inform you, Sirs, how this legal question arose and how it was carried on. If you, Sirs, are able in such and such a time <a name="fr_94"></a><a href="#fn_91"><font size="1">1</font></a> to settle this legal question according to the Dhamma, and according to the Vinaya, and according to the teaching of the Master, then will we entrust this legal question to you. But if you, Sirs, should not be able to do so, then will we ourselves retain the custody of the case." Thus, O Bhikkhus, is that legal question to be entrusted by the incoming Bhikkhus to the Bhikkhus dwelling in that residence, causing them duly to accept it. If those Bhikkhus, O Bhikkhus, are able to settle the case, that, O Bhikkhus, is called a settlement of the legal question. And how has it been settled? (&amp;c., as in last paragraph of § 16, down to the end.)</p>  
 <p>19. 'If, O Bhikkhus, whilst the case is being enquired into by those Bhikkhus, pointless speeches are brought forth, and the sense of any single utterance is not clear <a name="fr_95"></a><a href="#fn_92"><font size="1">2</font></a>, I enjoin upon you, O Bhikkhus, to settle the case by referring it (to a jury or commission) <a name="fr_96"></a><a href="#fn_93"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>

 <p>'And how has it been settled? By the Proceeding in Presence and by the vote of the majority. And what herein is meant by Proceeding in Presence? The presence of the Sa<i>m</i>gha, and the presence of the Dhamma, and the presence of the Vinaya, and the presence of the particular person. And of these, what is the presence of the Sa<i>m</i>gha?

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Bhikkhus were discontented with the settlement of the case by the Sa<i>m</i>gha at Sâvatthi. And they heard that in a certain residence there were dwelling a number of Theras versed in the traditions; men to whom the Agamas <a name="fr_112"></a><a href="#fn_109"><font size="1">1</font></a> had been handed down; reciters of the Dhamma, of the Vinaya, and of the Mâtikâs <a name="fr_113"></a><a href="#fn_110"><font size="1">2</font></a>, learned, discreet, wise, modest, conscientious, anxious to learn. And they thought, 'If those Theras would settle this case according to the Dhamma, and according to the Vinaya, and according to the teaching of the Master, then would this case be indeed well settled.' So those Bhikkhus went to that residence, and spake to those Theras thus: 'This legal question, Sirs, has arisen in such and such a manner, and has grown up in such and such a manner. It would be well if the venerable Theras would settle the case according to the Dhamma, and according to the Vinaya, and according to the teaching of the Master!' Then those Theras, saying, 'Even as the case has been settled by the Sa<i>m</i>gha at Sâvatthi, so is it well settled!' decided the case in the same way. Then those Bhikkhus who had been discontented with the decision of the Sa<i>m</i>gha at Sâvatthi were discontented with the decision of the number of Theras.</p>  
 <p>[The paragraph is repeated with the necessary alterations of consecutive applications to three, two and one Thera with the same result.]</p>

 <p>with the decision of the three Theras, discontented with the decision of the two Theras, discontented with the decision of the single Thera, went up to the place where the Blessed One was, and told the matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>This case, O Bhikkhus, is done with; having been once settled, it is settled for good.</p>  
 <p>26 <a name="fr_114"></a><a href="#fn_111"><font size="1">1</font></a>. 'I enjoin upon you, O Bhikkhus, three ways of taking votes, in order to appease such Bhikkhus <a name="fr_115"></a><a href="#fn_112"><font size="1">2</font></a>--the secret method, the whispering method, and the open method.</p>  
 <p>'And how, O Bhikkhus, is the secret method of taking votes? The Bhikkhu who is the teller of the votes is to make the voting tickets of different colours, and as each Bhikkhu comes up to him he is to say to him thus: "This is the ticket for the man of such an opinion; this the ticket for the man of such an opinion. Take whichever you like." When he has chosen (he is to add), "Don't show it to anybody." If he ascertains that those whose opinion is against the Dhamma are in the majority, he is to reject the vote as wrongly taken. If he ascertains that those whose opinion is in accordance with the Dhamma are in the majority, he is to report the vote as well taken. This, O Bhikkhus, is the secret method of taking the votes.</p>  
 <p>'And how, O Bhikkhus, is the whispering method of taking votes? The Bhikkhu who is the teller of the votes is to whisper in each Bhikkhu's ear, "This is the ticket of those of such an opinion; this is the ticket of those of such an opinion. Take whichever</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_57"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 57</font></a></p>  
 <p>you like." When he has chosen (he is to add), "Don't tell anybody (which way you have voted)." If he ascertains that those whose opinion is against the Dhamma are in the majority, he is to reject the vote as wrongly taken. If he ascertains that those whose opinion is in accordance with the Dhamma are in the majority, he is to report the vote as well taken. Thus, O Bhikkhus, is the whispering method of taking the votes.</p>  
 <p>And how, O Bhikkhus, is the open method of taking votes? If he ascertains (beforehand) that those whose opinion is in accordance with the Dhamma are in the majority, the vote is to be taken undisguisedly, openly. Thus, O Bhikkhus, is the open method of taking the votes.</p>  
 <p>'These, O Bhikkhus, are the three methods of taking the votes <a name="fr_116"></a><a href="#fn_113"><font size="1">1</font></a>.'</p>

 <p>'In case the Bhikkhus bring a groundless charge against a Bhikkhu of a breach of morality. In respect thereof, O Bhikkhus, to that Bhikkhu whose memory in regard to the matter is quite clear, the Proceeding for the consciously innocent is to be accorded.</p>

If he should say, "How may that be?" the answer should be as follows:</p>  
 <p>'In case a Bhikkhu warn another Bhikkhu in the midst of the Sa<i>m</i>gha of a grievous offence, and call upon him to recollect (whether he have. committed it or not), saying, "Has the venerable one been guilty of such and such a grievous offence--a Pârâ<i>g</i>ika offence, or an offence equivalent to a Pârâ<i>g</i>ika offence?"

But I do, Sir, recollect that I was guilty of such and such a trifling offence." To him thus denying the other insists [as before]. And he replies thus: "Seeing that I am willing, Sir, though you did not ask me, to confess myself guilty of that trifling offence, why should I not confess, when asked, such and such a grievous offence--a Pârâ<i>g</i>ika offence, or an offence equivalent to a Pârâ<i>g</i>ika offence?" And the other rejoins, "But you do not confess, Sir, even that trifling offence without being asked. How should you confess, if you were not asked, the commission of such and such a grievous offence--a Pârâ<i>g</i>ika offence, or one equivalent to a Pârâ<i>g</i>ika offence?

 <p>'Then, O Bhikkhus, the Proceeding for those who are obstinate should be carried out against that Bhikkhu.</p>  
 <p>'And thus should it be carried out (&amp;c., as chapter 11, § 2, down to the end, reading "such and such a Bhikkhu" for "Upavâla," and "grievous offence" for "offence ").</p>

 <p><a name="fn_77"></a><a href="sbe20015.htm#fr_80">38:1</a> Palâsî; no doubt connected with the primary meaning of the word 'leaf,' as is also its use in the sense of 'covering, lining,' in eka-palâsikâ upâhanâ at Mahâvagga V, 1, 29. The expression forms the subject of Puggala II, 2. See also <i>G</i>âtaka III, 259.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_78"></a><a href="sbe20015.htm#fr_81">40:1</a> Buddhaghosa has no explanation of these terms here, but on Aṅguttara Nikâya III, 2, 3, where the whole list recurs, he says (as Dr. Morris is good enough to inform us) that oko<i>t</i>imako is equal to laku<i>n</i><i>t</i>ako; and the same explanation is given by the commentary on Puggala IV, 19. Compare the use in English of 'a mere dot of a man,' in a similar sense.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_79"></a><a href="sbe20015.htm#fr_82">40:2</a> These three epithets of the voice are no doubt intended to be the opposites of the three in Mahâvagga V, 13.'9.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_80"></a><a href="sbe20015.htm#fr_83">41:1</a> We have already pointed out (above, IV, 1, 2) that this mode of the commencement of a discussion by setting out a list of the points to be discussed and compared is found also in some of the Abhidhamma books. There it was only the objects themselves, here we have all the predicates which it is proposed to apply (as in § 8), or to declare inapplicable to the object (as in § 10), which are set out, but the principle is the same.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_81"></a><a href="sbe20015.htm#fr_84">44:1</a> This is merely a play upon words. Âpatti is literally 'attainment to.' Standing alone it is always used with the connotation of 'attainment to guilt, sin, offence,' so that its etymological meaning is always lost sight of. Sotâpatti is the 'attainment to,' the 'entering upon' the stream, that is, the course of the Excellent Way. The Sam âpatti s, literally, 'complete, or higher, attainments,' are eight successive states of ecstatic insight or meditation practised by Arahats and other men of advanced spiritual culture. The question stated is in fact a riddle, like so many of the questions stated in the Parivâra and the Puggala-pa<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>atti.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_82"></a><a href="sbe20015.htm#fr_85">45:1</a> Here again the whole section depends upon a play upon the various meanings of the word ki<i>k</i><i>k</i>am. In the technical phrase ki<i>k</i><i>k</i>âdhikarana<i>m</i>, the word means solely the business or the agenda at the formal meetings of the Sa<i>m</i>gha (compare above, § 7). In the problems or riddles of this section its more common meaning of 'duty' is brought into play.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_83"></a><a href="sbe20015.htm#fr_86">45:2</a> Sammukhâ-vinayena. See above, chapter 2.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_85"></a><a href="sbe20015.htm#fr_88">46:1</a> The following five paragraphs recur in IV, 14, §§ 24, 27, and four of them in IV, 14, 21, 30.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_86"></a><a href="sbe20015.htm#fr_89">46:2</a> Kammappattâ. See Parivâra XIX, 1, 7, et seq.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_87"></a><a href="sbe20015.htm#fr_90">46:3</a> See above, Mahâvagga II, 23.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_88"></a><a href="sbe20015.htm#fr_91">46:4</a> Or rather, 'perhaps, 'against the proceedings which are being carried out.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_89"></a><a href="sbe20015.htm#fr_92">47:1</a> This is the 63rd Pâ<i>k</i>ittiya.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_90"></a><a href="sbe20015.htm#fr_93">47:2</a> This is the 79th Pâ<i>k</i>ittiya. The whole paragraph is repeated several times below in this chapter.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_91"></a><a href="sbe20015.htm#fr_94">49:1</a> Ettakena vâ antarena, on which Buddhaghosa has nothing. On vâ = eva, see Böhtlingk-Roth s.v. vâ, No. 4.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_92"></a><a href="sbe20015.htm#fr_95">49:2</a> These words recur at XII, 2, 7, where an instance occurs of the mode of proceeding here laid down.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_93"></a><a href="sbe20015.htm#fr_96">49:3</a> Ubbâhikâya. Childers has quite misunderstood both the meaning and the derivation of this term. It must be derived <a name="page_50"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 50</font></a> from ud+vah; and means simply 'reference'--the turning over of a difficult or intricate case from the general Sa<i>m</i>gha to a special committee, as was done at Vesâlî (below, XII, 2, 7).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_94"></a><a href="sbe20015.htm#fr_97">50:1</a> With this passage (so far) compare the Âkaṅkheyya Sutta, § 2 (translated in Rh. D.'s 'Buddhist Suttas,' p. 210), where the wording is somewhat different. See, however, the various readings here.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_95"></a><a href="sbe20015.htm#fr_98">50:2</a> We prefer to translate, in accordance with IX, 5, I below, sâttha<i>m</i> savya<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>ana<i>m</i> as given in the corrections to the text on p. 303; thus making the phrase 'in the spirit and in the letter' refer to the brahma-<i>k</i>ariya<i>m</i>, and not to the dhammâ. But it should be pointed out that the parallel passage in the stock description of a Buddha (for instance in Tevi<i>g</i><i>g</i>a Sutta I, 46, translated in Rh. D.'s 'Buddhist Suttas,' p. 187) would support the reading given here in the text, referring the phrase in question to the dhammâ, and not to the brahma-<i>k</i>ariya<i>m</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_96"></a><a href="sbe20015.htm#fr_99">50:3</a> See the various readings, and compare Sigâlovâda Sutta, p. 301; <i>G</i>âtaka II, 247, 293; Mahâvagga VI, 25, I.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_97"></a><a href="sbe20015.htm#fr_100">50:4</a> Though di<i>t</i><i>th</i>i is usually found in its bad sense of 'delusion' (it never means 'heresy,' as Childers renders it), it is also used, especially in older texts, in the good sense of 'insight.' Compare the 'Book of the Great Decease,' I, 11.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_98"></a><a href="sbe20015.htm#fr_101">51:1</a> Perhaps this may mean 'both as to the Suttas themselves and as to the Old Commentary upon them'--suttato anuvya<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>anaso. See 'Vinaya Texts,' vol. i, p. xviii, and note 2, p. xxix.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_99"></a><a href="sbe20015.htm#fr_102">51:2</a> Vinaye <i>kh</i>eko hoti asa<i>m</i>hîro. Compare on the use of these words, <i>G</i>âtaka I, 290; II, 161; Sutta Nipâta V, 18, 26.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_100"></a><a href="sbe20015.htm#fr_103">51:3</a> On all these terms, which have occurred above at IV, 2, I, see the commentary as there quoted in the notes.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_101"></a><a href="sbe20015.htm#fr_104">51:4</a> It is of course to be understood that the committee or jury does not consist of only one such Bhikkhu. In the instance already referred to as occurring in XII, 2, 7, four are chosen from each side.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_102"></a><a href="sbe20015.htm#fr_105">52:1</a> Sammukhâ-vinayena. See chapter 2.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_103"></a><a href="sbe20015.htm#fr_106">52:2</a> This is the same as in § 16 of this chapter, except that 'the presence of the Sa<i>m</i>gha' is omitted.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_104"></a><a href="sbe20015.htm#fr_107">52:3</a> See the 63rd Pâ<i>k</i>ittiya, and § 17 above.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_105"></a><a href="sbe20015.htm#fr_108">53:1</a> That is, the Pâtimokkha.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_106"></a><a href="sbe20015.htm#fr_109">53:2</a> Literally, 'cause him to arise.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_107"></a><a href="sbe20015.htm#fr_110">54:1</a> This sentence is also used of the other modes of settlement below, §§ 27, 29.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_108"></a><a href="sbe20015.htm#fr_111">54:2</a> So also above, § 16; and below, §§ 27-29.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_109"></a><a href="sbe20015.htm#fr_112">55:1</a> That is, the Four Nikâyas, now forming the Sutta Pi<i>t</i>aka.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_111"></a><a href="sbe20015.htm#fr_114">56:1</a> On the following section, compare chapters 9 and to above.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_113"></a><a href="sbe20015.htm#fr_116">57:1</a> This naive chapter would seem to show that the pia fraus was not unknown to the Buddhist monks at the time when the <i>K</i>ullavagga was composed. Buddhaghosa's note (given at p. 315 of H.O.'s edition of the text) specifies the different occasions when each of the three methods should be used.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_114"></a><a href="sbe20015.htm#fr_117">58:1</a> This clause corresponds to the one above, in §24, and below, in § 29.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_115"></a><a href="sbe20015.htm#fr_118">59:1</a> This section again bears exactly the same relation to chapter 11 as the previous ones have done to chapters 4 and 5 respectively. The outline of the form is the same, but as in the introductory part (containing the description of the offence) the present section is much fuller than the chapter to which it refers, 'we prefer to give that part of this section in full.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_116"></a><a href="sbe20015.htm#fr_119">62:1</a> Âyati<i>m</i> samvareyyâsi. So again in the next section. Compare V, 20, 5.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_117"></a><a href="sbe20015.htm#fr_120">63:1</a> See §§ 16, 29, &amp;c. of this chapter.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_119"></a><a href="sbe20015.htm#fr_122">64:1</a> This refers to the technical term of the Proceeding in question, ti<i>n</i>avatthârakena deseyya<i>m</i> (IV, 13, 2); and the singular of course includes the plural, as the confession usually took place before a number of Bhikkhus.</p>
