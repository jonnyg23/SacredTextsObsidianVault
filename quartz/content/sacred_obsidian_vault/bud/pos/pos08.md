And with great glee she worshipped, offering flowers.<a href="pos08.htm#34-2"><sup>147</sup></a> For this she gained rebirth among gods and men, till, in this Buddha-dispensation, she took birth in a clansman's family at Kosambī. She too became the friend of Sāmāvatī, and she too, out of grief at the death of the latter, entered the Order. She too could not gain self-mastery for twenty-five years, till in her old age she heard a timely sermon, through which her insight expanded and she won Arahantship, with thorough grasp of the Dhamma in form and meaning. Thereon reflecting, she broke forth:

 She, too, heaping up good under former Buddhas, was in the time of Vipassi Buddha, born at Bandhumatī, in the house of a certain wealthy landowner, and became a domestic servant. Grown up, she tended her master's household. Now, at that time, King Bandhumā (Vipassi's father), having restored Sabbath-keeping, gave gifts before dining and, after dining, attended a sermon; and the people, following his pious example, and keeping Sabbath, the slave thought: 'Why should not I, too, do as they all are doing?' And for the thoroughness of her observance of the feasts she was reborn among the Three-and-Thirty gods, and in other happy realms, and finally, in this Buddha-era, in the house of the Treasurer of Sāvatthī. Come to years of discretion, she heard Paṭācārā preach, and entered the Order; but she was unable to attain the climax of insight till Paṭācārā,<a href="pos08.htm#35-2"><sup>149</sup></a> seeing the state of her mind, gave her admonition.

 She, too, having made her resolve under former Buddhas, and heaping up good of age-enduring efficacy in this and that rebirth, was born, in the time of Vipassi Buddha, as a domestic servant, at Bandhumatī. One day, seeing an Arahant of the Master's Order seeking alms, she gladly offered him three sweet cakes. Through this reborn to happiness, she finally came to birth, in this Buddha-era, in

 She, too, having made her resolve under former Buddhas, and in this and that rebirth heaping up good of age-enduring efficacy, was born, when the world was empty of a Buddha, as a fairy by the River Candabhāgā.<a href="pos08.htm#37-3"><sup>153</sup></a> Sporting one day with the fairies, and straying awhile, she saw a silent

Come to years of discretion, she became a lay-believer in the Jeta Grove [College], and, later, entered the Order under Great Pajāpatī  the Gotamid. And one day, while staying at Rājagaha, she ascended the Vulture's Peak, after her meal, and while resting, she saw that which she tells of in her verse, whereby she won Arahantship, with thorough grasp of the Norm in form and in meaning.

 She too, having made her resolve in the time of former Buddhas, and heaping up, in this and that rebirth, Good valid <!-- sic --> for an æon of evolution, was born, in the time of
 Padumuttara Buddha, at the town of Haŋsavatī in a clansman's house. Come to years of discretion, she was left alone one day, her parents being engaged with a party in the inner court of the house. And seeing an Arahant approaching the house-door, she bade him 'Come in hither, lord,' and did him homage, showing him to a seat; she then took his bowl and filled it with food. The Elder thanked her, and departed. But she, reborn therefore in the heaven of the Three-and-Thirty gods, enjoying there a heavenly time and many a happy life thereafter, was, in this Buddha-era, reborn at Sāvatthī in the family of a very eminent burgess. And she was beautiful to see, and was brought into the house of the King of Kosala himself.<a href="pos08.htm#39-1"><sup>156</sup></a> After a few years a daughter was born to her, whom she named Jīvā.<a href="pos08.htm#39-2"><sup>157</sup></a>  The King saw the child, and was so pleased that he had Ubbirī anointed as Queen. But anon the little girl died, and the mother went daily mourning to the charnel-field. And one day she went and worshipped the Master, and sat down; but soon she left, and stood lamenting by the River Achiravatī. Then the Master, seeing her from afar, revealed himself, and asked her: 'Why dost thou weep?' 'I weep because of my daughter, Exalted One.' 'Burnt in this cemetery are some 84,000 <a href="pos08.htm#39-3"><sup>158</sup></a> of thy daughters. For which of them dost thou weep?' And pointing out the place where this one and that one had been laid, he said half the psalm:

 And all of them were named like unto her.<br>
 Now which of all those Jīvās dost thou mourn? (51)</a>

 <p>
 And she pondered with intelligence on the Norm thus taught by the Master, and so stirred up insight that, by the charm of his teaching and her own attainment of the requisite conditions, she reached the topmost fruit, even Arahantship.<a href="pos08.htm#40-1"><sup>159</sup></a> And showing forth the high distinction she had won, she spoke the second half of the psalm:

 She, too, having fared in the past as the foregoing Sisters, was born in a clansman's house. <a href="pos08.htm#40-4"><sup>162</sup></a> Come to years of discretion, she went with lay-women disciples to the Vihāra, <a href="pos08.htm#40-5"><sup>163</sup></a> and heard the Master preach. Becoming a believer, she left the world and became learned, proficient in the doctrine, and a ready speaker. Leading for centuries a religious life, <a href="pos08.htm#41-1"><sup>164</sup></a> she yet died a worldling at heart, and was reborn in the heaven of bliss.<a href="pos08.htm#41-2"><sup>165</sup></a> Again, when Vipassi was Buddha, and again when Vessabhu was Buddha, she kept the precepts, and was learned and proficient in doctrine. Again, when Kakusandha was Buddha, and yet again when Konāgamana was Buddha, she took Orders, and was pure in conduct, learnèd, and a preacher. At length, she was, in this Buddha-era, reborn at Rājagaha, in the family of an eminent burgess, and called Sukkā (bright, lustrous, 'Lucy'). Come to years of discretion, she found faith in the Master at her own home, and became a lay-disciple. But later, when she heard Dhammadinnā preach,<a href="pos08.htm#41-3"><sup>166</sup></a> she was thrilled with emotion, and renounced the world under her. And performing the exercises for insight, she not long after attained Arahantship, together with thorough grasp of the Norm in form and in meaning.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Thereupon, attended by 500 Bhikkhunīs, she became a great preacher. And one day, when they had been into Rājagaha for alms, and had returned and dined, they entered the Bhikkhunīs' settlement, and Sukkā, with a great company seated around her, taught the doctrine in such wise that she seemed to be giving them sweet mead to drink and sprinkling them with ambrosia. And they all listened to her rapt, motionless, intent. Thereupon the spirit<a href="pos08.htm#41-4"><sup>167</sup></a> of the tree that stood at the end of the Sisters' terrace was inspired by her teaching, and went out to Rājagaha, walking about the ways and the squares proclaiming her excellence, and saying:
 </p>
 
 <table align="center">
 <tr><td>
 <b></b><p><a name="54">
 What would ye men of Rājagaha have? <br>
 What have ye done? that mute and idle here<br>

 Nor wait upon Sukkā, while she reveals <br>
 The precious gospel by the Buddha taught. (54)</a><br><a name="55">
 The wise in heart, methinks, were fain to quaff <br>
 That life's elixir, once won never lost, <br>
 That welleth ever up in her sweet words, <br>

 And hearing what the tree-spirit said, the people were excited, and came to the Sister and listened attentively.

 She, too, having fared in the past as the foregoing Sisters, was born in a clansman's house at Haŋsavatī, <a href="pos08.htm#42-2"><sup>169</sup></a>  and was given in marriage by her parents to a clansman's son of equal birth. With him she lived happily till his death. Then, being herself advanced in years, and growing anxious as she sought to find Good, <a href="pos08.htm#42-3"><sup>170</sup></a> she went about from park to park, <a href="pos08.htm#42-4"><sup>171</sup></a> from vihāra to vihāra, with the intention of teaching religion (<i>dhamma</i>) to votaries of religion. Then one day she came up to the Bo-tree of the Master <a href="pos08.htm#43-1"><sup>172</sup></a> and sat down, thinking: 'If a Buddha, an Exalted One, be unequalled and peerless among men, may this one show me the miracle of Buddhahood.' Scarce had the thought arisen when the Tree blazed forth, the branches appeared as if made of gold, the horizon shone all around. And she, inspired at that sight, fell down and worshipped, and for seven days sat there. On the seventh day she performed a grand feast of offering and worship to the Buddha.<a href="pos08.htm#43-2"><sup>173</sup></a> By this meritorious karma she was reborn in this Buddha-era, in the kingdom of Āḷavī, as the King's daughter, and named Selā. <a href="pos08.htm#43-3"><sup>174</sup></a> But she was also known as 'The Āḷavikan.' <a href="pos08.htm#43-4"><sup>175</sup></a> Come to years of discretion, the Master converted her father, ordained him, and went with him to the city of Āḷavī. Selā, being yet unmarried, went with the King and heard the Master preach. She became a believer and a lay-disciple. Afterwards, growing anxious, she took Orders, worked her way to insight, and because of the promise in her and the maturity of her knowledge, she, crushing the formations of thought, word and deed,<a href="pos08.htm#43-5"><sup>176</sup></a> soon won Arahantship.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Thereafter, as an Elder, she lived at Sāvatthī. And one day she went forth from Sāvatthī to take siesta in the Dark Grove, and sat down beneath a tree. Then Māra, alone and wishing to interrupt her privacy, approached in the guise of a stranger, saying:

 Then the Sister–thinking: 'Verily, 'tis that foolish Māra who would deny me the Nibbana that is revealed to me, and bids me choose the sensuous life. He knows not that I am an Arahant. Now will I tell him and confound him'– recited the following: <a href="pos08.htm#44-1"><sup>177</sup></a>

 She, too, having fared in the past as the foregoing Sisters, was, in the time of Sikhi Buddha, <a href="pos08.htm#44-3"><sup>179</sup></a>
  reborn in the family of an eminent noble, and, when grown up, was made the chief consort of the King Aruṇavā. The story of her past is similar to that of Sister Abhayā.  <a href="pos08.htm#45-1"><sup>180</sup></a>
  The story of her present is that, in this Buddha-era, she was reborn as the daughter of the chaplain of King Bimbisāra <a href="pos08.htm#45-2"><sup>181</sup></a> at Rājagaha, and named Somā. Come to years of discretion, she came to believe in the Master in her own home, and became a lay-disciple.

 For women, from the age of seven or eight, boiling rice at all times, know not the moment when the rice is cooked, but must take some grains in a spoon and press it with two fingers; hence the expression 'two-finger' sense. <a href="pos08.htm#45-3"><sup>182</sup></a> Then the Elder rebuked Māra:
