 <h2 align="center">XIII. TEVI<i>GG</i>A SUTTA.</h2>
 
 <h3 align="center">[ON KNOWLEDGE OF THE VEDAS<sup><small>{1}</small></sup>.]</h3>
 
 <p>   <a name="text%20p.%20235">[235]</a> 1. Thus have I heard. When the Exalted One was once journeying through Kosala with a great company of the brethren, with about five hundred brethren, he came to the Brahman village in Kosala which is called Manasâka<i>t</i>a. And there at Manasâka<i>t</i>a the Exalted One stayed in the mango grove, on the bank of the river A<i>k</i>iravatî, to the north of Manasâka<i>t</i>a.</p>
 
 <p>   2. Now at that time many very distinguished and wealthy Brahmans were staying at Manasâka<i>t</i>a; to wit, Kankî the Brahman, Târukkha the Brahman, Pokkharasâdi the Brahman, <i>G</i>â<i>n</i>usso<i>n</i>i the Brahman, Todeyya the Brahman, and other very distinguished and wealthy Brahmans{2}.</p>
 
 <p><small>{1. This Suttanta was translated from the MSS. in my 'Buddhist Suttas' (S. B. E., 1881). Since then the text has been published by the Pâli Text Society; and alterations and amendments in a number of details have been rendered necessary.</small></p>
 
 <p>2. Buddhaghosa says that--<br>    Ka<u>n</u>kî lived at Opasâda,<br>    Târukkha lived at I<i>kkh</i>agala (so MSS., perhaps for I<i>kkh</i>ânangala),<br>    Pokkharasâdi (<i>sic</i> MS.) lived at Ukka<i>tth</i>a,<br>    Gâ<i>n</i>usso<i>n</i>i lived at Savatthi, and<br>    Todeyya lived at Tudigama.</p>
 
 <p><i>G</i>â<i>n</i>usso<i>n</i>i was converted by the Bhaya-bherava Sutta. On Pokkharasâdi, see above, pp. <a href="dob-03tx.htm">108</a>, <a href="dob-03tx.htm#p.%20135">135</a>, <a href="dob-04tx.htm#p.%20147">147</a>; and on Todeyya, see above, <a href="dob-10tx.htm">p. 267</a>; and on all the names, see Ma<i>ggh</i>ima Nikaya, No. 98 = Sutta Nipata III, 9.</p>
 
 <p>Buddhaghosa adds that because Manasâka<i>t</i>a was a pleasant place the Brahmans had built huts there on the bank of the river and fenced them in, and used to go and stay there from time to time to repeat their mantras.}</p>

 <p>   3. Now a conversation sprung up between Vâse<i>tth</i>a and Bhâradvâ<i>g</i>a, when they were taking exercise (after their bath) and walking up and down in thoughtful mood, as to which was the true path, and which the false{1}.'</p>
 
 <p>   4. The young Brahman Vâse<i>tth</i>a spake thus:</p>
 
 <p>   'This is the straight path, this the direct way which makes for salvation, and leads him, who acts according to it, into a state of union with Brahmâ. I mean that which has been announced by the Brahman Pokkharasâdi.'</p>
 
 <p>   5. The young Brahman Bhâradvâ<i>g</i>a spake thus:</p>
 
 <p>   'This is the straight path, this the direct way which makes for salvation, and leads him, who acts according to it, into a state of union with Brahmâ. <a name="text%20p.%20236">[236]</a> I mean that which has been announced by the Brahman Târukkha.'</p>
 
 <p>   6. But neither was the young Brahman Vâse<i>tth</i>a able to convince the young Brahman Bhâradvâ<i>g</i>a, nor was the young Brahman Bhâradvâ<i>g</i>a able to convince the young Brahman Vâse<i>tth</i>a.</p>
 
 <p>   7. Then the young Brahman Vâse<i>tth</i>a said to the young Brahman Bhâradvâ<i>g</i>a:</p>
 
 <p>   'That Sama<i>n</i>a Gotama, Bhâradvâ<i>g</i>a, of the sons of the Sâkyas, who went out from the Sâkya clan to adopt the religious life, is now staying at Manasâka<i>t</i>a, in the mango grove, on the bank of the river A<i>k</i>iravatî, to the north of Manasâka<i>t</i>a. Now regarding that venerable Gotama, such is the high reputation that has been noised abroad: "That Exalted One is an Arahat, a fully enlightened one, abounding in wisdom and goodness, happy, with knowledge of the worlds, unsurpassed as a guide to mortals willing to be led, a teacher of gods and men, an Exalted One, a Buddha."</p>

 <p>Come, then, Bhâradvâ<i>g</i>a, let us go to the place where the Sama<i>n</i>a Gotama is; and when we have come there, let us ask the Sama<i>n</i>a Gotama touching this. matter. What the Sama<i>n</i>a Gotama shall declare unto us, that let us bear in mind{1}.'</p>
 
 <p>   'Very well, my friend!' said the young Brahman Bhâradvâ<i>g</i>a, in assent, to the young Brahman Vâse<i>tth</i>a.</p>
 
 <p>   8. Then the young Brahman Vâse<i>tth</i>a and the young Brahman Bhâradvâ<i>g</i>a went on to the place where the Exalted One was.</p>
 
 <p>   And when they had come there, they exchanged with the Exalted One the greetings and compliments of politeness and courtesy, and sat down beside him. And while they were thus seated the young Brahman Vâse<i>tth</i>a said to the Exalted One:</p>
 
 <p>   'As we, Gotama, were taking exercise and walking up and down, there sprung up a conversation between us on which was the true path, and which the false. I said thus:</p>
 
 <p>   '"This is the straight path, this the direct way which makes for salvation, and leads him who acts according to it, into a state of union with Brahmâ. I mean that which has been announced by the Brahman Pokkharasâdi."'</p>
 
 <p>   'Bhâradvâ<i>g</i>a said thus:</p>
 
 <p>   '"This is the straight path, this the direct way which makes for salvation, and leads him, who acts according to it, into a state of union with Brahmâ. I mean that which has been announced by the Brahman Târukkha."'</p>
 
 <p>   'Regarding this matter, Gotama, there is a strife, a dispute, a difference of opinion between us.' <a name="text%20p.%20237">[237]</a></p>
 
 <hr width="33%" align="center">
 
 <p>   9. 'So you say, Vâse<i>tth</i>a, that you said thus:</p>
 
 <p>   '"This is the straight path, this the direct way which makes for salvation, and leads him, who acts according to it, into a state of union with Brahmâ.</p>

 <p>   'Wherein, then, O Vâse<i>tth</i>a, is there a strife, a dispute, a difference of opinion between you{1}?'</p>
 
 <p>   10. 'Concerning the true path and the false, Gotama. Various Brahmans, Gotama, teach various paths. The Addhariyâ Brahmans, the Tittiriyâ Brahmans, the <i>Kh</i>andokâ Brahmans [the <i>Kh</i>andavâ Brahmans], the Bavhari<i>g</i>â Brahmans{2}. Are all those saving paths? Are they all paths which will lead him, who acts according to them, into a state of union with Brahmâ?</p>
 
 <p>   'Just, Gotama, as near a village or a town there are many and various paths{3}, yet they all meet together in the village--just in that way are all the various paths taught by various Brahmans--the Addhariyâ Brahmans, the Tittiriyâ Brahmans, the <i>Kh</i>andokâ Brahmans [the <i>Kh</i>andavâ Brahmans], the Bavhari<i>g</i>â Brahmans. Are all these saving paths? Are they all paths which will lead him, who acts according to them, into a state of union with Brahmâ?'</p>
 
 <p>   11. 'Do you say that they all lead aright, Vâse<i>tth</i>a?</p>
 
 <p>   'I say so, Gotama.'</p>
 
 <p><small>{1. This is either mildly sarcastic--as much as to say, 'that is six of one, and half a dozen of the other'--or is intended to lead on Vâse<i>tth</i>a to confess still more directly the fact that the different theologians held inconsistent opinions.</small></p>
 
 <p>2. The MSS. differ as to the last name, and some of them omit the last but one. The Adhvaryu, Taittîriya, <i>Kh</i>andoga, and Bahv<i>rik</i>a priests--those skilled in liturgy generally, and in the Ya<i>g</i>ur, Sâma, and Rig Vedas respectively--are probably meant. If we adopt the other reading for the last in the list, then those priests who relied on liturgy, sacrifice, or chant would be contrasted with those who had 'gone forth' as <i>religieux</i>, either as <i>Tâpasas</i> or as <i>Bhikshus</i>.</p>

 <p>   'Forms perceptible to the eye; desirable, agreeable, pleasant, attractive forms, that are accompanied by lust and cause delight. Sounds of the same kind perceptible to the ear. Odours of the same kind perceptible to the nose. Tastes of the same kind perceptible to the tongue. Substances of the same kind perceptible to the body by touch. These five things predisposing to passion are called, in the Discipline of the Arahats, a "chain" and a "bond." And these five things predisposing to lust, Vâse<i>tth</i>a, do the Brahmans versed in the Three Vedas cling to, they are infatuated by them, attached to them, see not the danger of them, know not how unreliable they are, and so enjoy them{1}.'</p>

But the reference is no doubt to the first 'hindrance'; and the word in the text, though doubtless alluding to possession of women also, includes more.

 <p>   39. When he had thus spoken, Vâse<i>tth</i>a, the young Brahman, said to the Blessed One:</p>

 <p>   'So be it, Lord!' said the young Brahman Vâse<i>tth</i>a, in assent, to the Blessed One.</p>
 
 <p>   40. 'Then the Blessed One spake, and said: 'Know, Vâse<i>tth</i>a, that (from time to time) a Tathâgata is born into the world, an Arahat, a fully awakened one, abounding in wisdom and goodness, happy, with knowledge of the worlds, unsurpassed as a guide to mortals willing to be led, a teacher of gods and men, a Blessed One, a Buddha. He, by himself, thoroughly understands, and sees, as it were, face to face this universe--including the worlds above with the gods, the Mâras, and the Brahmâs; and the world below with its Sama<i>n</i>as and Brahmans, its princes and peoples;--and he then makes his knowledge known to others. The truth doth he proclaim both in the letter and in the spirit, lovely in its origin, lovely in its progress, lovely in its consummation: the higher life doth he make known, in all its purity and in all its perfectness.</p>
 
 <p>   41. 'A householder (gahapati), or one of his children, or a man of inferior birth in any class, listens to that truth{1}. On hearing the truth he has faith in the Tathâgata, and when he has acquired that faith he thus considers with himself:</p>
 
 <p>   '"Full of hindrances is household life, a path defiled by passion: free as the air is the life of him who has renounced all worldly things. How difficult it is for the man who dwells at home to live the higher life in all its fullness, in all its purity, in all its bright perfection! Let me then cut off my hair and beard, let me clothe myself in the orange-coloured robes, and let me go forth from a household life into the homeless state!"</p>

 <p>   42. 'When he has thus become a recluse he passes a life self-restrained by that restraint which should be binding on a recluse. Uprightness is his delight, and he sees danger in the least of those things he should avoid. He adopts and trains himself in the precepts. He encompasses himself with goodness in word and deed.
