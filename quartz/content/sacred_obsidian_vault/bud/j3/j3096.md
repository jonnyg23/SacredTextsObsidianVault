 <p><i>"Our old friend," etc.</i>—The Master told this tale while dwelling in Jetavana, concerning a greedy Brother. The occasion is as above.</p>

 <p>Once upon a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was a pigeon and lived in a nest-basket in the kitchen of a</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Benares merchant. A crow became intimate with him and lived there also. Here the story is to be expanded. The cook pulled out the crow's feathers and sprinkled him with flour, then piercing a cowrie he hung it on the crow's neck and threw him into a basket. The Bodhisatta came from the wood, and seeing him made a jest and spoke the first stanza:—</p>  
 <p><small><div style="margin-left: 32px">Our old friend! look at him!<br>     A jewel bright he wears;<br> His beard in gallant trim,<br>     How gay our friend appears!</div></small></p>  
 <p>[315] The crow hearing him spoke the second stanza:—</p>  
 <p><small><div style="margin-left: 32px">My nails and hair had grown so fast,<br>     They hampered me in all I did:<br> A barber came along at last,<br>     And of superfluous hair I'm rid.</div></small></p>  
 <p>Then the Bodhisatta spoke the third stanza:—</p>  
 <p><small><div style="margin-left: 32px">Granted you got a barber then,<br>     Who has cropped your hair so well:<br> Round your neck, will you explain,<br>     What's that tinkling like a bell?</div></small></p>  
 <p>Then the crow uttered two stanzas:—</p>  
 <p><small><div style="margin-left: 32px">Men of fashion wear a gem<br>     Round the neck: it's often done:<br> I am imitating them:<br>     Don't suppose it's just for fun.</div></small></p>  
 <p><small><div style="margin-left: 32px">If you're really envious<br>     Of my beard that's trimmed so true:<br> I can get you barbered thus;<br>     You may have the jewel too.</div></small></p>  
 <p>The Bodhisatta hearing him spoke the sixth stanza:—</p>  
 <p><small><div style="margin-left: 32px">Nay, ’tis you they best become,<br>     Gem and beard that's trimmed so true.<br> I find your presence troublesome:<br>     I go with a good-day to you.</div></small></p>  
 <p>[316] With these words he flew up and went elsewhere; and the crow died then and there.</p>  
 <p></p><hr width="50%">  
 <p>After the lesson, the Master declared the Truths and identified the Birth:—After the Truths, the greedy Brother was established in the fruition of the Third Path: "At that time the crow was the greedy Brother, the pigeon was myself."</p>
