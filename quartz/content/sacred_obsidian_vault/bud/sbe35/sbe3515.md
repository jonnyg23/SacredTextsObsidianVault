 <h3 align="CENTER">[THE MURDER OF MOGGALLÂNA.]</h3>
 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>1. 'Venerable Nâgasena, it has been said by the Blessed One: "This is the chief, O Bhikkhus, of those of my disciples in the Order who are possessed of the power of Iddhi, I mean Moggallâna <a name="fr_556"></a><a href="#fn_547"><font size="1">1</font></a>." But on the other hand they say his death took place by his being beaten to death with clubs, so that his skull was broken, and his bones ground to powder, and all his flesh and nerves bruised and pounded together <a name="fr_557"></a><a href="#fn_548"><font size="1">2</font></a>. Now, Nâgasena, if the Elder, the great Moggallâna, had really attained to supremacy in the magical power of Iddhi, then it cannot be true that he was beaten to death with clubs <a name="fr_558"></a><a href="#fn_549"><font size="1">3</font></a>. But if his death was on that wise, then the saying that he was chief of those possessed of Iddhi must be wrong. How could he who was not even able, by his power of Iddhi, to prevent his own murder, be worthy nevertheless to stand as succour to the world of gods and men? This too is a double-edged problem now put to you, and you have to solve it.'</p>
 <p>2. 'The Blessed One did declare, O king, that Moggallâna was chief among the disciples in power</p>
 <p>

 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_262"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 262</font></a></p>
 <p>of Iddhi. And he was nevertheless beaten to death by clubs. But that was through his being then possessed by the still greater power of Karma <a name="fr_559"></a><a href="#fn_550"><font size="1">1</font></a>.'</p>
 <p>3. 'But, venerable Nâgasena, [<b>189</b>] are not both of these things appurtenant to him who has the power of Iddhi--that is the extent of his power, and the result of his Karma--both alike unthinkable? And cannot the unthinkable be held back by the unthinkable? Just, Sir, as those who want the fruits will knock a wood apple <a name="fr_560"></a><a href="#fn_551"><font size="1">2</font></a> down with a wood apple, or a mango with a mango, so ought not the unthinkable in like manner to be subject to restraint by the unthinkable?'</p>
 <p>'Even among things beyond the reach of the imagination, great king, still one is in excess above the other, one more powerful than the other. Just, O king, as the monarchs of the world are alike in kind, but among them, so alike in kind, one may overcome the rest, and bring them under his command--just so among things beyond the grasp of the imagination is the productive effect of Karma by far the most powerful. It is precisely the effect of Karma which overcomes all the rest, and has them under its rule; and no other influence is of any avail to the man in whom Karma is working out its inevitable end <a name="fr_561"></a><a href="#fn_552"><font size="1">3</font></a>. It is as when, O king, any man has committed an offence against the law <a name="fr_562"></a><a href="#fn_553"><font size="1">4</font></a>.</p>

 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> Neither his mother nor his father, neither his sisters nor his brother, neither his friends nor his intimate associates can protect him then. He has fallen therein under the power of the king who will issue his command respecting him. And why is that so? Because of the wrong that he has done. So is it precisely the effect of Karma which overcomes all other influences, and has them under its command, and no other influence can avail the man in whom Karma is working out its inevitable end. It is as when a jungle fire has arisen on the earth, then can not even a thousand pots of water avail to put it out, but the conflagration overpowers all, and brings it under its control. And why is that so? Because of the fierceness of its heat. So is it precisely the effect of Karma which overcomes all other influences, and has them under its command; and no other influence can avail the man in whom Karma is working out its inevitable end. That is why the venerable one, great king, the great Moggallâna, when, at a time when he was possessed by Karma, he was being beaten to death with clubs, was yet unable to make use of his power of Iddhi <a name="fr_563"></a><a href="#fn_554"><font size="1">1</font></a>.'</p>
 <p>'Very good, Nâgasena! That is so, and I accept it as you say.'</p>

 </font><h3 align="CENTER">[ON SECRET DOCTRINE.]</h3>
 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>4. [<b>190</b>] 'Venerable Nâgasena, it was said by the Blessed One: "The Dhamma and the Vinaya (Doctrine and Canon Law) proclaimed by the Tathâgata shine forth when they are displayed, and not when they are concealed <a name="fr_564"></a><a href="#fn_555"><font size="1">1</font></a>." But on the other hand the recitation of the Pâtimokkha and the whole of the Vinaya Pi<i>t</i>aka are closed and kept secret <a name="fr_565"></a><a href="#fn_556"><font size="1">2</font></a>. So that if, Nâgasena, you (members of the Order) carried out what is just, and right, and held of faith in the teaching of the Conqueror then would the Vinaya shine forth as an open thing. And why would that be so? Because all the instruction therein, the discipline, the self-control, the regulations as to moral and virtuous conduct, are in their essence full of truth and righteousness, and redounding to emancipation of heart. But if the Blessed One really said that the Dhamma and Vinaya proclaimed by the Tathâgata shine forth when displayed and not when kept secret, then the saying that the recitation of the Pâtimokkha and the whole of the Vinaya must be kept secret must be wrong. And if that be right, then the saying of the Blessed One must be wrong. This too is a double-edged problem now put to you, and you have to solve it.'</p>
 <p>5. 'It was said, O king, by the Blessed One that the Dhamma and Vinaya proclaimed by the Tathâgata</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_265"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 265</font></a></p>
 <p>shine forth when displayed, and not when kept secret. And on the other hand the recitation of the Pâtimokkha and the whole of the Vinaya Pi<i>t</i>aka are kept close and secret <a name="fr_566"></a><a href="#fn_557"><font size="1">1</font></a>. But this last is not the case as regards all men. They are only kept secret up to a certain limit. And the recitation of the Pâtimokkha is kept secret up to that certain limit on three grounds--firstly because that is the traditional custom <a name="fr_567"></a><a href="#fn_558"><font size="1">2</font></a> of previous Tathâgatas, secondly out of respect for the Truth (Dhamma), and thirdly out of respect for the position of a member of the Order <a name="fr_568"></a><a href="#fn_559"><font size="1">3</font></a>.'</p>
 <p>6. 'And as to the first it was the universal custom, O king, of previous Tathâgatas for the recitation of the Pâtimokkha to take place in the midst of the members of the Order only, to the exclusion of all others. Just, O king, as the Kshatriya secret formulas (of the nobles) are handed down among the nobles alone, and that this or that is so is common tradition among the nobles <a name="fr_569"></a><a href="#fn_560"><font size="1">4</font></a> of the world and kept secret from all others--[<b>191</b>] so was this the universal custom of previous Tathâgatas, that the recitation of the Pâtimokkha should take place among the</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_266"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 266</font></a></p>
 <p>members of the Order only, and be kept secret from all others. And again, just as there are several classes of people, O king, known as distinct in the world---such as wrestlers, tumblers, jugglers, actors, ballet-dancers, and followers of the mystic cult of the sun and moon, of the goddess of fortune and other gods <a name="fr_570"></a><a href="#fn_561"><font size="1">1</font></a>. And the secrets of each of these sects are handed on in the sect itself, and kept hidden from all others. just so with the universal custom of all the Tathâgatas that the recitation of the Pâtimokkha should take place before the members of the Order only, and be kept secret from all others. This is why the recitation of the Pâtimokkha is, up to that extent, kept secret in accordance with the habit of previous Tathâgatas.'</p>
 <p>7. 'And how is it that the Pâtimokkha is kept secret, up to that extent, out of reverence for the Dhamma? The Dhamma, great king, is venerable and weighty. He who has attained to proficiency in it may exhort another in this wise: "Let not this Dhamma so full of truth, so excellent, fall into the hands of those unversed in it, where it would be despised and contemned, treated shamefully, made a game of, and found fault with. Nor let it fall into the hands of the wicked who would deal with it in all respects as badly as they." It is thus, O king, that the recitation of the Pâtimokkha is, up to that</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_267"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 267</font></a></p>
 <p>extent, kept secret out of reverence for the Dhamma. For if not, then it would be like the best, most costly, and most rare red sandal wood of the finest kind, which when brought to Savara (that city of the outcast Ka<i>nd</i>âlas <a name="fr_571"></a><a href="#fn_562"><font size="1">1</font></a>) is despised and contemned, treated shamefully, made game of, and found fault with.'</p>
 <p>8. [<b>192</b>] 'And how is it that the Pâtimokkha is kept secret, up to that extent, out of reverence for the position of a member of the Order? The condition of a Bhikkhu, great king, is in glory beyond the reach of calculation by weight, or measure, or price. None can value it, weigh it, measure it. And the recitation of the Pâtimokkha, is carried on before the Bhikkhus alone, lest any one who has occupied that position should be brought down to a level with the men of the world. just, O king, as if there be any priceless thing, in vesture or floor covering, in elephants, chargers, or chariots, in gold or silver or jewels or pearls or women, or in unsurpassable strong drink <a name="fr_572"></a><a href="#fn_563"><font size="1">2</font></a>, all such things are the appanage of kings--just so, O king, whatever is most priceless in the way of training, of the traditions of the Blessed One, of learning, of conduct, and of the virtues of righteousness and self-control--all these are the appanages of the Order of Bhikkhus. This is why the recitation of the Pâtimokkha is, to that extent, kept secret <a name="fr_573"></a><a href="#fn_564"><font size="1">3</font></a>.'</p>

 </font><h3 align="CENTER">[THE TWO KINDS OF FALSEHOOD.]</h3>
 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>9. 'Venerable Nâgasena, it has been said by the Blessed One that a deliberate lie is an offence of the greatest kind (involving exclusion from the Order <a name="fr_574"></a><a href="#fn_565"><font size="1">1</font></a>).</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_269"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 269</font></a></p>
 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> And again he said: "By a deliberate lie a Bhikkhu commits a minor offence, one that ought to be the subject of confession made before another (member of the Order) <a name="fr_575"></a><a href="#fn_566"><font size="1">1</font></a>." Now, venerable Nâgasena, what is herein the distinction, what the reason, that by one lie a Bhikkhu is cast out of the Order, and by another he is guilty only of an offence that can be atoned for. If the first decision be right, then the second must be wrong; but if the second be right, then the first must be wrong. This too is a double-edged problem now put to you, and you have to solve it.'</p>
 <p>10. [<b>193</b>] <a name="fr_576"></a><a href="#fn_567"><font size="1">2</font></a>'Both your quotations, O king, are correct <a name="fr_577"></a><a href="#fn_568"><font size="1">3</font></a>. But a falsehood is a light or heavy offence according to the subject matter. For what do you think, great king? Suppose a man were to give another a slap with his hand, what punishment would you inflict upon him?'</p>
 <p>'If the other refused to overlook the matter, then neither should we be able to pardon his assailant <a name="fr_578"></a><a href="#fn_569"><font size="1">4</font></a>, but should mulct him in a penny or so <a name="fr_579"></a><a href="#fn_570"><font size="1">5</font></a>.'</p>

 <p>yourself that he had given the blow to, what would then be the punishment?'</p>
 <p>'We should condemn him to have his hands cut off, and his feet cut off, and to be skinned alive <a name="fr_580"></a><a href="#fn_571"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and we should confiscate all the goods in his house, and put to death all his family to the seventh generation on both sides.'</p>
 <p>'But, great king, what is the distinction? Why is it that for one slap of the hand there should be a gentle fine of a penny, while for a slap given to you there should be so fearful a retribution?'</p>
 <p>'Because of the difference in the person (assaulted).'</p>
 <p>'Well! just so, great king, is a falsehood a light or a heavy offence according to the attendant circumstances.'</p>

 </font><h3 align="CENTER">[THE BODISAT'S CONSIDERATION.]</h3>
 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>11. 'Venerable Nâgasena, it has been said by the Blessed One in the discourse on the essential conditions <a name="fr_581"></a><a href="#fn_572"><font size="1">2</font></a>: "Long ago have his parents been destined for each Bodisat, and the kind of tree he is to select for his Bo tree, and the</p>

But on the other hand he said: "When yet in the condition of a god in the Tusita heaven the Bodisat makes the eight Great Investigations--he investigates the time (whether the right moment had come at which he ought to be re-born as a man), and the continent (in which his birth is to take place), and the country (where he is to be re-born), and the family (to which he is to belong), and the mother (who is to bear him), and the period (during which he was to remain in the womb), and the month (in which his birthday shall come), and his renunciation (when it shall be) <a name="fr_582"></a><a href="#fn_573"><font size="1">1</font></a>. [<b>194</b>] Now, Nâgasena, before knowledge is ripe there is no understanding, but when it has reached its summit there is no longer any need to wait for thinking a matter over <a name="fr_583"></a><a href="#fn_573"><font size="1">1</font></a>, for there is nothing outside the ken of the omniscient mind. Why then should the Bodisat investigate the time, thinking to himself: "In what moment shall I be born <a name="fr_584"></a><a href="#fn_574"><font size="1">2</font></a>?" And for the same reason why should he investigate the family, thinking to himself:</p>

And if, Nâgasena, it is a settled matter who shall be the parents of the Bodisat, then it must be false that he "investigated the family." But if that be true, then must the other saying be wrong. This too is a double-edged problem now put to you, and you have to solve it.'</p>
 <p>12. 'It was both a settled matter, O king, who should be the parents of the Bodisat, and he did investigate into the question as to which family he was to be born into. But how did he do so? He thought over the matter as to whether his parents should be nobles or Brahmans. With respect to eight things, O king, should the future be investigated before it comes to pass. A merchant, O king, should investigate goods before he buys them--an elephant should try with its trunk a path it has not yet trod--a cartman should try a ford he has not yet crossed over--a pilot should test a shore he has not yet arrived at, and so guide the ship--a physician should find out the period of life which his patient has lasted <a name="fr_585"></a><a href="#fn_575"><font size="1">1</font></a> before he treats his disease--a traveller should test the stability of a bambû bridge <a name="fr_586"></a><a href="#fn_576"><font size="1">2</font></a>before he mounts on to it--a Bhikkhu should find out how much time has yet to run before sun turn before he begins to eat his meal--and Bodisats, before they are born, should investigate the question whether it would be right for them to be born in the family of a noble or of a Brahman.</p>

 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>13. [<b>195</b>] 'Venerable Nâgasena, it has been said by the Blessed One: "A brother is not, O Bhikkhus, to commit suicide. Whosoever does so shall be dealt with according to the law <a name="fr_587"></a><a href="#fn_577"><font size="1">1</font></a>." And on the other hand you (members of the Order) say: "On whatsoever subject the Blessed One was addressing the disciples, he always, and with various similes, preached to them in order to bring about the destruction of birth, of old age, of disease, and of death.

 <p>'The good man, O king, perfect in uprightness, is like a medicine to men <a name="fr_589"></a><a href="#fn_579"><font size="1">1</font></a> in being an antidote to the poison of evil, he is like water to men in laying the dust and the impurities of evil dispositions, he is like a jewel treasure to men in bestowing upon them all attainments in righteousness, he is like a boat to men inasmuch as he conveys them to the further shore of the four flooded streams (of lust, individuality, delusion, and ignorance) <a name="fr_590"></a><a href="#fn_580"><font size="1">2</font></a>, he is like a caravan owner to men in that he brings them beyond the sandy desert of rebirths, he is like a mighty rain cloud to men in that he fills their hearts with satisfaction, he is like a teacher to men in that he trains them in all good, he is like a good guide to men in that he points out to them the path of peace. It was in order that so good a man as that, one whose good qualities are so many, so various, so immeasurable, [<b>196</b>] in order that so great a treasure mine of good things, so full of benefit to all beings, might not be done away with, that the Blessed One, O king, out of his mercy towards all beings, laid down that injunction, when he said: "A brother is not, O Bhikkhus, to commit suicide. Whosoever does so shall be dealt with according to the law." This is the reason for which the Blessed One prohibited (self-slaughter). And it was said, O king,</p>

Association with the unpleasant is painful, and separation from the pleasant <a name="fr_592"></a><a href="#fn_582"><font size="1">2</font></a>. The death of a mother is painful, or of a father, or a brother, or a sister, or a son, or a wife, or of any relative.

Painful is the fear of possible blame attaching to oneself, or to others, the fear of punishment, the fear of misfortune.

And what are these eleven? He who does so sleeps in peace, and in peace does he awake. He dreams no sinful dreams. He becomes dear to men, and to the beings who are not men  <a name="fr_608"></a><a href="#fn_598"><font size="1">2</font></a>. The gods watch over him. Neither fire, nor poison, nor sword works any harm to him. Quickly and easily does he become tranquillised. The aspect of his countenance is calm.

Now, venerable Nâgasena, if the passage I have quoted from the words of the Blessed One be right, then this statement of yours must be wrong. But if the story of Prince Sâma be right, then it cannot be true that neither fire, nor poison, nor sword can work harm to him who cultivates the habit of love to all beings. This too is a double-edged problem, so subtle, so abstruse, so delicate, and so profound, that the thought of having to solve it might well bring out sweat over the body even of the most subtle-minded of mortals. This problem is now put to you. Unravel this mighty knot <a name="fr_611"></a><a href="#fn_601"><font size="1">2</font></a>. Throw light upon this matter <a name="fr_612"></a><a href="#fn_602"><font size="1">3</font></a> to the accomplishment of the desire of those sons of the Conqueror who shall arise hereafter <a name="fr_613"></a><a href="#fn_603"><font size="1">4</font></a>.'</p>
 <p>'The Blessed One spake, O king, as you have quoted. And Prince Sama dwelling in the cultivation of love, and thus followed by a herd of deer when he was wandering in the forest, was hit by the poisoned arrow shot by king Piliyakkha, and then and there fainted and fell. But there is a reason for that. [<b>199</b>] And what is the reason? Simply that those virtues (said in the passage you quoted</p>

And when Prince Sâma was upsetting the water-pot, that moment he lapsed from the actual feeling of love. At the moment, O king, in which an individual has realised the sense of love, that moment neither fire, nor poison, nor sword can do him harm. If any men bent on doing him an injury come up, they will not see him, neither will they have a chance of hurting him. But these virtues, O king, are not inherent in the individual, they are in the actual felt presence of the love that he is calling up in his heart.'</p>
 <p>'Suppose, O king, a man were to take into his hand a Vanishing Root of supernatural power; and that, so long as it was actually in his hand, no other ordinary person would be able to see him. The virtue, then, would not be in the man. It would be in the root that such virtue would reside that an object in the very line of sight of ordinary mortals could, nevertheless, not be seen. just so, O king, is it with the virtue inherent in the felt presence of love that a man has called up in his heart.'</p>
 <p>'Or it is like the case of a man [<b>200</b>] who has entered into a well-formed mighty cave. No storm of rain, however mightily it might pour down, would be able to wet him. But that would be by no virtue inherent</p>

 <p>'Yes! The practice of love is productive of all virtuous conditions of mind both in good (beings) and in evil ones. To all beings whatsoever, who are in the bonds of conscious existence <a name="fr_617"></a><a href="#fn_607"><font size="1">2</font></a>, is this practice of love of great advantage, and therefore ought it to be sedulously cultivated.'</p>

And the king, being put out of temper at the sight of his graceful and pleasant style of pace and motion, said to the elephant trainer with the hope of bringing about the death of the elephant: "Trainer, this elephant has not been properly trained, make him perform the trick called 'Sky walking.'"

 <p>'Nay, not so, great king! Good and evil have not the same result. Devadatta was opposed by everybody. No one was hostile to the Bodisat.

 <p>'And when, O king, you say that Devadatta and the Bodisat accompanied one another in the passage from birth to birth, that meeting together of theirs took place not, only at the end of a hundred, or a thousand, or a hundred thousand births, but was in fact constantly and frequently taking place through an immeasurable period of time <a name="fr_650"></a><a href="#fn_640"><font size="1">2</font></a>.

 <p>purblind tortoise and the attainment of the condition of a human being. And it was not only with Devadatta that such union took place. Sâriputta the Elder also, O king, was through thousands of births the father, or the grandfather, or the uncle <a name="fr_651"></a><a href="#fn_641"><font size="1">1</font></a>, or the brother, or the son, or the nephew, or the friend of the Bodisat; and the Bodisat was the father, or the grandfather, or the uncle, or the brother, or the son, or the nephew, or the friend of Sâriputta the Elder.</p>
 <p>'All beings in fact, O king, who, in various forms as creatures, are carried down the stream of transmigration, meet, as they are whirled along in it, both with pleasant companions and with disagreeable ones-just as water whirled along in a stream meets with pure and impure substances, with the beautiful and with the ugly.</p>
 <p>'And when, O king, Devadatta as the god, had been himself Unrighteous, and had led others into unrighteousness of life, he was burnt in purgatory for an immeasurable period of time <a name="fr_652"></a><a href="#fn_642"><font size="1">2</font></a>. [<b>205</b>] But the Bodisat, who, as the god, had been himself Righteous, and had led others into righteousness of life, lived in all the bliss of heaven for a like immeasurable period of time. And whilst in this life, Devadatta, who had plotted injury against the Buddha, and had created a schism in the Order, was swallowed up by the earth, the Tathâgata,</p>

 <p>things. Through her fear of censure in this world the opportunity seemed to her not fit, and through her fear of the sufferings of purgatory in the next world. And because she knew how bitter is the fruit of wrong-doing, and because she did not wish to lose her loved one, and because of the high esteem in which she held her husband, and because she honoured goodness, and despised ignobleness of life, and because she did not want to break with her customary mode of life--for all these reasons the opportunity seemed to her not fit.</p>
 <p>'And, further, she refused to do wrong because, on consideration, she was not sure of keeping the thing secret from the world.

Now how was it, Nâgasena? Did those Arahats run away from fear--or did they run away willing to let the Blessed One be destroyed, and thinking: "(Our conduct) will be clear (to him) from the way in which he himself will act <a name="fr_667"></a><a href="#fn_657"><font size="1">2</font></a>," [<b>208</b>] or did they run away with the hope of watching the immense and unequalled mighty power which the Tathâgata would exhibit?

But if the story be true, then the statement that the Arahats have put away fear and trembling must be false. This too is a double-edged problem now put to you, and you have to solve it.'</p>
 <p>45. 'The Blessed One did say, O king, that Arahats have put away all fear and trembling, and five hundred Arahats, save only Ânanda, did, as you say, run away when the elephant Dhana-pâlaka bore down upon the Tathâgata that day in Râ<i>g</i>agaha. But that was neither out of fear, nor from willingness to let the Blessed One be destroyed. For the cause by which Arahats could be made to fear or tremble has been destroyed in them, and therefore are they free from fear or trembling. Is the broad earth, O king, afraid at people digging into it, or breaking it up, or at having to bear the weight of the mighty oceans and the peaked mountain ranges?'</p>
 <p>'Certainly not, Sir.'</p>
 <p>'But why not?'</p>
 <p>'Because there is no cause in the broad earth which could produce fear or trembling.'</p>
 <p>'Just so, O king. And neither is there any such cause in Arahats. And would a mountain peak be afraid of being split up, or broken down, or made to fall, or burnt with fire?'</p>
 <p>'Certainly not, Sir.'</p>
 <p>'But why not?' [<b>209</b>]</p>
 <p>'The cause of fear or trembling does not exist within it.'</p>
 <p>'And just so, O king, with Arahats. If all the creatures of various outward form in the whole</p>

 <p>universe <a name="fr_668"></a><a href="#fn_658"><font size="1">1</font></a> were, together, to attack one Arahat in order to put him to fear, yet would they bring about no variation in his heart. And why? Because there is neither condition nor cause for fear (in him, whence fear could arise). Rather, O king, was it these considerations that arose in the minds of those Arahats: "To-day when the best of the best of men, the hero among conquerors, has entered into the famous city, Dhana-pâlaka the elephant will rush down the street. But to a certainty the brother who is his special attendant will not forsake him who is above the god of gods. But if we should not go away, then neither will the goodness of Ânanda be made manifest, nor will the elephant actually approach <a name="fr_669"></a><a href="#fn_659"><font size="1">2</font></a> the Tathâgata. Let us then withdraw. Thus will great masses of the people attain to emancipation from the bonds of evil, and the goodness of Ânanda be made manifest." It was on the realisation of the fact that those advantages would arise from their doing so, that the Arahats withdrew to every side.'</p>
 <p>'Well, Nâgasena, have you solved the puzzle. That is so. The Arahats feared not, nor did they tremble. But for the advantages that they foresaw they withdrew on every side.'</p>

And on the other hand they say: "When the company of the members of the Order presided over by Sâriputta and Moggallâna had been dismissed by the Blessed One <a name="fr_671"></a><a href="#fn_661"><font size="1">2</font></a>, then the Sâkyas of Kâtumâ and Brahmâ Sabanipati, by means of the parables of the seed and of the calf, gained the Buddha over, and obtained his forgiveness, and made him see the thing in the right light <a name="fr_672"></a><a href="#fn_662"><font size="1">3</font></a>." Now how was that, Nâgasena? Were those two parables unknown to him that he should be [<b>210</b>] appeased and gained over to their side, and brought to see the matter in a new light? But if he did not already know them, then, Nâgasena, he was not all-wise. If he did know them, then he must have dismissed those brethren rudely and violently <a name="fr_673"></a><a href="#fn_663"><font size="1">4</font></a> in order to try them; and therein is his unkindness made manifest.

 <p>away, and he saw the matter in the light (in which the intercessors on their behalf wished him to see it). For the Tathâgata, O king, is lord of the Scriptures. It was with parables that had been first preached by the Tathâgata himself <a name="fr_674"></a><a href="#fn_664"><font size="1">1</font></a> that they conciliated him, pleased him, gained him over, and it was on being thus gained over that he signified his approval (of what they had said). It was, O king, as when a wife conciliates, and pleases, and gains over her husband by means of things that belong to the husband himself; and the husband signifies his approval thereof. Or it was, O king, as when the royal barber conciliates and pleases and gains over the king when he dresses the king's head with the golden comb <a name="fr_675"></a><a href="#fn_665"><font size="1">2</font></a> which belongs to the king himself, and the king then signifies his approval thereof, Or it was, O king, as when an attendant novice, when he serves his teacher with the food given in alms which his teacher has himself brought home, conciliates him and pleases him and gains him over, and the teacher then signifies his approval thereof.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_557"></a><a href="sbe3515.htm#fr_566">265:1</a> This is, so far as I know, the earliest mention of this being the case. There is nothing in the Pâtimokkha itself (see my translation of this list of offences against the rules of the Order in vol. i of the 'Vinaya Texts' in the S. B. E.) as to its recitation taking place in secret, and nothing in the Vinaya as to its being kept secret. But the regulations in the Vinaya as to the recitation of the Pâtimokkha forbade the actual presence of any one not a member of the Order, and as a matter of fact any one not such a member is excluded in practice during its recitation now in Ceylon. But it would be no offence in a layman to read the Vinaya, and learned laymen who have left the Order still do so.</p>

The Si<i>m</i>halese simply repeats them all, adding only the word bhaktiyo, 'believers in,' to the names of the various divinities. The classing together of jugglers, ballet-dancers, and followers of the numerous mystic cults, so numerous in India, is thoroughly Buddhistic, and quite in the vein of Gotama himself--as, for instance, in the Mahâ Sîla (see my 'Buddhist Suttas,' p. 196).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_564"></a><a href="sbe3515.htm#fr_573">267:3</a> It will be noticed that there is no mention here (in a connection where, if it had then existed, it would almost certainly have been referred to) of any Esoteric Buddhism. So above, at <a name="page_268"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 268</font></a> IV, 1, 8, it is stated that a good Buddhist teacher should keep nothing secret from his pupil. And even in so old a text as the 'Book of the Great Decease' (Chap. II, § 32, p. 36 of my <a href="errata.htm#2">translation</a> in the Buddhist Suttas'), it is said of the Buddha himself that he had 'no such thing as the closed fist of a teacher who keeps some things back.' This passage is itself quoted above at IV, 2, 4, as the basis of one of Milinda's questions; and is entirely accepted by Nâgasena, that is, by our author. The fact is that there has never been any such thing as esoteric teaching in Buddhism, and that the modern so called esoteric Buddhism is neither esoteric nor Buddhism. Its tenets, so far as they are Indian at all, are perfectly accessible, are well known to all those who choose to study the books of Indian mysticism, and are Hindu, not Buddhist. They are, indeed, quite contradictory to Buddhism, of which the authors of what they ignorantly call Esoteric Buddhism know but very little--that little being only a portion of those beliefs which have been common ground to all religious teachers in India. If one doctrine--more than any other--is distinctive of Buddhism, it is the ignoring, in ethics, of the time-honoured belief in a soul--that is, in the old sense, in a separate creature inside the body, which flies out of it, like a bird out of a cage, when the body dies. Yet the Theosophists, who believe, I am told, in seven souls inside each human body (which would be worse according to true Buddhism than seven devils), still venture to call themselves Buddhists, and do not see the absurdity of their position!</p>

 <p><a name="fn_566"></a><a href="sbe3515.htm#fr_575">269:1</a> I cannot trace these identical words in the Pi<i>t</i>aka texts. But the general sense of them is exactly in agreement with the first Pâ<i>k</i>ittiya rule.</p>

Another eloquent little outburst of his is preserved for us in verses 201 and 202 of the Therâ Gâthâ. 'O for the Buddhas, and their doctrines! O for the achievements of our Master! Thereby may the disciple realise the Truth. Through countless æons of time has Selfness followed on Selfness. But this one is now the last. This aggregation (of mental and material qualities which forms me now again into an individuality) is at last the end, the end of the coming and going of births and deaths. There will be no rebirth for me!' But where the verses are so full of allusions to the deepest Buddhist psychology, it is impossible to reproduce in English the vigour of the original Pâli.

I follow throughout Hîna<i>t</i>i-kumburê's interpretation (pp. 260, 261) of these pretty names, which could be well matched in the West. That some Indian kings were cruel in the extreme is no doubt true. But it must not be supposed that this list gives the names of well-known punishments. It is merely a string of technical terms which is repeated by rote whenever tortures have to be specified. And the meaning of its terms was most likely unknown to the very people who so used them. For the whole list (which is taken by our author from the Pâli Pi<i>t</i>akas) is explained by Buddhaghosa in his commentary, the Manoratha Pûranî, on A<u>n</u>guttara III, 1, 1, as edited by Dr. Morris at pp. 113, 114 of the first edition of his A<u>n</u>guttara for the Pâli Text Society, 1884. But Buddhaghosa's explanations differ from Hîna<i>t</i>i-kumburê's in several details; and to nearly half the names he gives alternative meanings, quite contradictory to those that he gives first. So the list had its origin some centuries (say 400-500) B.C., and was certainly <a name="page_278"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 278</font></a> not understood in the fifth century A. D.; and was probably therefore unintelligible also, at least in part, to our author.</p>

Dr. Morris, at p. 92 of the 1 Pâli Text Society's journal' for 1884, suggests velika. Perhaps it was simply adika after all, with or without <i>m</i> euphonic.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_597"></a><a href="sbe3515.htm#fr_607">279:1</a> This same string of words, except the first, is used of the Iddhi-pâdas in the Book of the Great Decease, III, 3 (p. 40 of vol. xi of the S. B. E). The words 'towards all beings' are not in the text. But this is the meaning of the phrase used, and not love to men only, as would be understood if they were not inserted in the translation.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_604"></a><a href="sbe3515.htm#fr_614">281:1</a> Bhânanâ is really more than 'cultivation.' It is the actual, present, felt sense of the particular moral state that is being cultivated (in this case, of love). I have elsewhere rendered it 'meditation': but as the ethical doctrine, and practice, are alike unknown to us, we have no word that exactly reproduces the connotation of the Pâli phrase.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_605"></a><a href="sbe3515.htm#fr_615">282:1</a> This is no quibble. The early Buddhists did believe in the power of a subjective love over external circumstances. It is true that the best known instances in which this power is represented as having been actually exercised, are instances of the power of love over the hearts of other beings, and hence, indirectly, over their actions. Thus when Devadatta had had the fierce, manslaying elephant Nâlâgiri let loose against the Buddha (<i>K</i>ullavagga VII, 3, 11, 12), Gotama is said to have permeated him with his love, and the elephant then went up to him only to salute him, and allowed himself to be stroked, and did no harm. And when the five disciples had intended, when he went to Benares, to show him no respect, the Buddha, in like manner, is said to have 'concentrated that feeling of his love which was able to pervade generally all beings in earth and heaven,' and to have 'directed it specially towards them.' Then 'the sense of his love diffused itself through their hearts. And as he came nearer and nearer, unable any longer to adhere to their resolve, they rose from their seats, and bowed down before him, and welcomed him with every mark of reverence and of respect' ('Buddhist Birth Stories,' vol. i, p. 112).</p>
 <p>And when he wished to convert Ro<i>g</i>a the Mallian, the Buddha is said, in like manner, to have 'suffused him with the feeling of his love.' And then Roga, 'overcome by the Blessed One by the sense of his love--just as a young calf follows the kine, so did he go from apartment to apartment' seeking the Blessed One (Mahâvagga VI, 36, 4).</p>
 <p>And again, when the Bhikkhus told the Buddha of a brother having been killed by a snake-bite, he is represented (in the <i>K</i>ullavagga V, 6) to have said: 'Now surely that brother had not let his love flow out over the four royal kinds of serpents. Had he done so, he would not have died of the bite of a snake.' And then he is said to have enjoined the use of a poem of love to snakes (set out in the text quoted) as a safeguard against snake-bite. This goes really much further than the other instances, but no case is given of that safeguard having been actually used successfully. And I know of no case in the Pâli Pi<i>t</i>akas of the felt presence <a name="page_283"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 283</font></a> of the feeling of love being said to have actually counteracted either fire, or poison, or sword.</p>
 <p>It is noteworthy that the Si<i>m</i>halese inserts here six pages (265-271) of matter not found in the Pâli. But as it gives at length the story of Prince Sâma, it is taken, I presume, from the <i>G</i>âtaka book.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_606"></a><a href="sbe3515.htm#fr_616">283:1</a> This is something quite different from what was said before.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_611"></a><a href="sbe3515.htm#fr_621">284:2</a> 'Wicked' and 'pure' are in the Pâli ka<i>n</i>he and sukka, literally, 'dark' and light.' The only other passage I recollect where these names of colours are used in an ethical sense is the 87th verse of the Dhammapada. Professor Max Müller there renders: 'A wise man should leave the dark state (of ordinary life), and follow the bright state (of the Bhikshu),' (S. B. E., Vol. X, p. 26.) But the words should certainly be translated: 'A wise man should put away wicked dispositions, and cultivate purity of heart.' Bhâvetha could never refer to adopting or following any outward profession. It is exclusively used of the practice, cultivation, of inward feelings. And the commentary, which is quoted by Professor Fausböll, takes the passage in the Dhammapada in that sense, just as Hîna<i>t</i>i-kumburê (p. 271) does here.</p>

[The name of that story in Professor Fausböll's edition is Khavaka-<i>G</i>âtaka, but throughout the story itself the word Ka<i>nd</i>âla is used in the passages corresponding to those in which Professor Fausböll has <i>Kh</i>apaka (sic),--a coincidence which throws light on our author, <i>Kh</i>avaka-ka<i>nd</i>âla.] The story here referred to is the Amba <i>G</i>âtaka (No. 474) in which the word Khavaka does not occur.</p>

But a comparison of the poetical version of the same story in the <i>K</i>ariyâ Pi<i>t</i>aka II, 6 (p. 87 of Dr. Morris's edition for the Pâli Text Society) shows that the same story is here referred to.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_644"></a><a href="sbe3515.htm#fr_654">293:2</a> This discussion is very interesting, both as a specimen of casuistry, and as an exposition of orthodox Buddhist belief. And it is full of suggestion if taken as a statement of the kind of reason which led the Buddhist editors of the earlier folk-lore to identify Devadatta with the characters referred to by king Milinda. But the facts are that those editors, in using the old stories and legends for their ethical purposes, always identified Devadatta with the cruel person in the story, and paid no heed to the question whether be was superior or not in birth or in the consideration of the world, to the person they identified with the Bodisat. In searching through the four volumes of the published <i>G</i>âtakas, and the proof-sheets of the fifth volume with which Professor Fausböll has favoured me, for the purpose of tracing the stories referred to by our author, I find that Devadatta appears in sixty-four of them, and that in almost every one of these sixty-four he is either superior in birth, or equal to the character identified with the Bodisat. This is not surprising, for it is not unusually the superiors in birth who are guilty of the kind of cruelty and wickedness which the Buddhist editors would ascribe to Devadatta. So that our author, had he chosen to do so, might have adduced many other instances of a similar kind to those he actually quotes. I add in an appendix the full list of the Devadatta stories in the <i>G</i>âtakas. It is clear our author had before him a version of the <i>G</i>âtaka book slightly different from our own, as will be seen from the cases pointed out in the notes in which, as to names or details, the story known to him differs from the printed text. And also that here (as at III, 6, 2) he would have been able to solve his own dilemma much better if he had known more of the history of those sacred books on the words of which it is based.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_645"></a><a href="sbe3515.htm#fr_655">294:1</a> It is not meant that men would not. But that is too clear to be even worthy of mention, whereas with regard to women the question is worth discussion. Our author is mistaken in ascribing this verse to the Buddha. It is only found (as has been pointed out by Mr. Trenckner) in a <i>G</i>âtaka story, No. 536, and is a specimen, not of Buddhist teaching, but of Indian folk-lore. There is a very similar sentiment in <i>G</i>âtaka, No. 62 (vol. i, p. 289).</p>

The phrase is really very parallel to the saying in Numbers xxxii. 23, 'Be sure your sin will find you out'--namely, in its results--and is as true ethically as it is difficult grammatically.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_654"></a><a href="sbe3515.htm#fr_664">297:1</a> The position of women in India, at the time when Buddhism arose, was, theoretically, very low. The folk tales are full of stories turning on the wiles of women, and the Hindoo law-books seem never tired of the theme of her uncleanness, her weakness, and her wickedness. But, except in matters of property, the bark was I think worse than the bite. Among the people, in the homes of the peasantry, the philippics of the Brahmin priests were not much regarded, and the women led lives as pleasant as those of their male relations, and shared in such mental and physical advantages as their male relations enjoyed. The influence of Buddhism must have been felt in two directions. In the first place the importance attached to the celibate life must have encouraged the kind of view taken of women among Catholics in mediaeval times (the Brahmin view being much akin to those that were promulgated by Luther). On the other hand the fact that women were admitted to the Order, and that the still higher aim of Arahatship was held to be attainable by them, must have helped to encourage a high esteem for women. We have many instances of women who were credited with the insight of Arahatship. A whole treatise in the Buddhist sacred books, the Theri Gâtha, is devoted to hymns and poems ascribed to them, and many of these reach a very high level of intelligent and spiritual emotion.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_655"></a><a href="sbe3515.htm#fr_665">297:2</a> I do not know the exact passage referred to, but there are many of similar tendency in the sacred books. See, for instance, Dhammapada, verses 39, 188, 214, 351, and 385; and Sutta Nipâta, verses 15, 70, 212, 621, and 965.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_656"></a><a href="sbe3515.htm#fr_666">298:1</a> Here again we have a variation between our author's words and those of the Pi<i>t</i>akas. In the <i>K</i>ullavagga VII, 3, 11, 12 (translated in pp. 247-250 of vol. iii of the 'Vinaya Texts' in the 'Sacred Books of the East'), we have the oldest versions of this story; and there the elephant is called, not Dhana-pâlaka, but Nâlâgiri, and the number of attendant disciples (who are not called Arahats) is not given as five hundred. The Buddha is simply said to have entered Râ<i>g</i>agaha 'with a number of Bhikkhus.' Nothing also is said, either of their running away, or of Ânanda's remaining behind. It is, no doubt, an easily explicable and very pretty alteration of the story, which exhibits Ânanda, the beloved disciple, as acting in this way. But it is none the less an alteration.</p>
 <p>It should be added that Nâlâgiri (it should be Nâ<i>l</i>âgiri) in the Vinaya text is a personal name of the elephant, but may be derived from its place of origin. (See the references to a famous elephant named Nâ<i>l</i>âgiri in the Megha Dûta and Na<i>d</i>âgiri in the Kathâ Sarit Sâgara XI, 42, XII, 10, XIII, 7, 29. But Pâ<i>n</i>ini VI, 3, 117, gives the latter as the name of a mountain.) So while there may be a variation in the legend, it may also be that we have only two names for the same elephant, just as one might speak of the Shetland pony (named) Brownie. And the stanza quoted below (p. 410 of the Pâli text) shows that the name Dhana-pâlaka was given already in older texts to the Nâ<i>l</i>âgiri elephant.</p>

But the expression is a very strange one, and perhaps, after all, it merely means, 'The matter will turn out according to his Karma.'</p>
