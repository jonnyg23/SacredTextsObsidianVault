 <p>209. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">He</span> who gives himself to vanity and not to the truly profitable, shunning the true pursuit, and grasping at pleasure, will come to envy him who has sought the true profit.</p>  
 <p>210. Let no man cleave to what is pleasant or unpleasant: parting with the pleasant is pain, and painful is the presence of the unpleasant.</p>  
 <p>211. Take a liking to nothing; loss of the prize is evil. There are no bonds for him who has neither likes nor dislikes.</p>  
 <p>212. From attachment comes grief, from attachment comes fear. He who is pure from attachment knows neither grief nor fear.</p>  
 <p>213. From affection come grief and fear. He who is without affection knows neither grief nor fear.</p>  
 <p>214. From pleasure come grief and fear. He who is freed from pleasure knows neither grief nor fear.</p>  
 <p>215. From lust come grief and fear. He who is freed from lust knows neither grief nor fear.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_54"><font size="1" color="green">p. 54</font></a></p>  
 <p>216. From desire come grief and fear. He who is free of desire knows neither grief nor fear.</p>  
 <p>217. The man of counsel and insight, of righteousness and truth, who minds his own affairs, him the crowd holds dear.</p>  
 <p>218. If a man's heart be set upon the Ineffable (Nirvāna), his mind brought to perfection, and every thought freed from lust, he is called the strong swimmer who forges his way against the stream.</p>  
 <p>219. When, after long voyaging afar, one returns in safety home, kinsfolk and friends receive him gladly;</p>  
 <p>220. Even so his good deeds receive the good man, when he leaves this world for the next, as kinsfolk greet a dear traveller.</p>
