 <p>116. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Cling</span> to what is right: so will you keep the mind from wrong. Whoso is slack in well-doing comes to rejoice in evil.</p>  
 <p>117. If one offends, let him not repeat his offence; let him not set his heart upon it. Sad is the piling up of sin.</p>  
 <p>118. If one does well, let him repeat his well-doing: let him set his heart upon it. Glad is the storing up of good.</p>  
 <p>119. The bad man sees good days, until his wrong-doing ripens; then he beholds evil days.</p>  
 <p>120. Even a good man may see evil days till his well-doing comes to fruition; then he beholds good days.</p>  
 <p>121. Think not lightly of evil "It will not come nigh me." Drop by drop the pitcher is filled: slowly yet surely the fool is saturated with evil.</p>  
 <p>122. Think not lightly of good "It will not come nigh me." Drop by drop the pitcher is</p>  
 <p><a name="page_39"><font size="1" color="green">p. 39</font></a></p>  
 <p>filled: slowly yet surely the good are filled with merit.</p>  
 <p>123. A trader whose pack is great and whose caravan is small shuns a dangerous road; a man who loves his life shuns poison: so do thou shun evil.</p>  
 <p>124. He who has no wound can handle poison: the unwounded hand cannot absorb it. There is no evil to him that does no evil.</p>  
 <p>125. Whoso is offended by the inoffensive man, and whoso blames an innocent man, his evil returns upon him as fine dust thrown against the wind.</p>  
 <p>126. Some go to the womb; some, evil-doers, to hell; the good go to heaven; the sinless to Nirvāna.</p>  
 <p>127. Not in the sky, nor in mid-ocean, nor in mountain-cave can one find sanctuary from his sins.</p>  
 <p>128. Not in the sky, not in mid-ocean, not in mountain-cave can one find release from the conquering might of death.</p>
