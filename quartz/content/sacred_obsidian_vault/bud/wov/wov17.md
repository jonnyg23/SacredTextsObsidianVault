 <p>167. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Let</span> no man foster evil habits; let no man live in sloth: let none follow false doctrines, none prolong his sojourn in this world.</p>  
 <p>168. Up! Idle not, but follow after good. The good man lives happy in this world and the next.</p>  
 <p>169. Follow after virtue, not after vice. The virtuous live happy in this world and the next.</p>  
 <p>170. The king of Death sees not him who regards the world as a bubble, a mirage.</p>  
 <p>171. Come then, think of the world as a painted chariot of the king—a morass where fools are sinking, where the wise take no pleasure.</p>  
 <p>172. He who in former days was slothful, and has put off sloth, lights up the world as the moon freed of the clouds.</p>  
 <p>173. He who covers his idle deeds with goodness lights up the world as the moon freed of clouds.</p>  
 <p>174. Blinded are the men of this world; few there are who have eyes to see: few are the</p>

 <p>birds which escape the fowler's net; few are they who go to heaven.</p>  
 <p>175. Through the sky fly the swans: Rishis too pass through the air. The wise leave the world altogether, deserting Mara and his hosts.</p>  
 <p>176. There is no wrong he would not do who breaks one precept, speaking lies and mocking at the life to come.</p>  
 <p>177. Misers go not to the realm of gods: therefore he is a fool who does not delight in liberality. The wise delighting in liberality come thereby with gladness to the other world.</p>  
 <p>178. Good is kingship of the earth; good is birth in heaven; good is universal empire; better still is the fruit of conversion.</p>
