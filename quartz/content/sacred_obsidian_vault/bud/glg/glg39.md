 <p>A Zen student told Ummon: "Brilliancy of Buddha illuminates the whole universe."</p>  
 <p>Before he finished the phrase Ummon asked: "You are reciting another's poem, are you not?"</p>  
 <p>"Yes," answered the student.</p>  
 <p>"You are sidetracked," said Ummon.</p>  
 <p>Afterwards another teacher, Shishin, asked his pupils: "At what point did that student go off the track?"</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p><i>Mumon's comment:</i> If anyone perceives Ummon's particular skillfulness, he will know at what point the student was off the track, and he will be a teacher of man and Devas. If not, he cannot even perceive himself.</p>
