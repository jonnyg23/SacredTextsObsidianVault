 <p>A monk asked Ummon: "What is Buddha?"</p>  
 <p>Ummon answered him: "Dried dung." </p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p><i>Mumon's comment:</i> It seems to me Ummon is so poor he cannot distinguish the taste of one food from another, or else he is too busy to write readable letters. Well, he tried to hold his school with dried dung. And his teaching was just as useless.</p>
