 <p>A monk told Joshu: "I have just entered the monastery. Please teach me."</p>  
 <p>Joshu asked: "Have you eaten your rice porridge?"</p>  
 <p>The monk replied: "I have eaten."</p>  
 <p>Joshu said: "Then you had better wash your bowl."</p>  
 <p>At that moment the monk was enlightened.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p><i>Mumon's comment:</i> Joshu is the man who opens his mouth and shows his heart. I doubt if this monk really saw Joshu's heart. I hope he did not mistake the bell for a pitcher.</p>
