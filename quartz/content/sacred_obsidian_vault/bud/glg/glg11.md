 <p>Joshu went to a place where a monk had retired to meditate and asked him: "What is, is what?"</p>  
 <p>The monk raised his fist.</p>  
 <p>Joshu replied: "Ships cannot remain where the water is too shallow." And he left.</p>  
 <p>A few days later Joshu went again to visit the monk and asked the same question.</p>  
 <p>The monk answered the same way.</p>  
 <p>Joshu said: "Well given, well taken, well killed, well saved." And he bowed to the monk.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p><i>Mumon's comment:</i> The raised fist was the same both times. Why is it Joshu did not admit the first and approved the second one? Where is the fault?</p>  
 <p>Whoever answers this knows that Joshu's tongue has no bone so he can use it freely. Yet perhaps Joshu is wrong. Or, through that monk, he may have discovered his mistake.</p>  
 <p>If anyone thinks that the one's insight exceeds the other's, he has no eyes.</p>
