   <h3 align="center">VARGA 22. THE LADY ÂMRÂ <a name="fr_673"></a><a href="#fn_673"><font size="1">2</font></a> (ÂMRAPÂLÎ) SEES BUDDHA.</h3>  
 <p>The lord of the world having finished his wide work of conversion conceived in himself a desire (heart) for Nirvâ<i>n</i>a. Accordingly proceeding from the city of Râ<i>g</i>ag<i>ri</i>ha, he went on towards the town of Pa-lin-fo (Pâ<i>t</i>aliputra) <a name="fr_674"></a><a href="#fn_674"><font size="1">3</font></a>. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1735</font></span></p>  
 <p>Having arrived there, he dwelt in the famous Pâ<i>t</i>ali <i>k</i>etiya <a name="fr_675"></a><a href="#fn_675"><font size="1">4</font></a>. Now this (town of Pâ<i>t</i>aliputra) is</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_250"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 250</font></a></p>  
 <p>the frontier town of Magadha, defending the outskirts of the country. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1736</font></span></p>  
 <p>Ruling the country was a Brahman <a name="fr_676"></a><a href="#fn_676"><font size="1">1</font></a> of wide renown and great learning in the scriptures (sûtras); and (there was also) an overseer of the country, to take the omens of the land with respect to rest or calamity. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1737</font></span></p>  
 <p>At this time the king of Magadha sent to that officer of inspection (overseer) a messenger to warn and command him to raise fortifications in the neighbourhood (round) of the town for its security and protection. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1738</font></span></p>  
 <p>And now the lord of the world, as they were raising the fortifications, predicted that in consequence of the Devas and spirits who protected and kept (the land), the place should continue strong and free from calamity (destruction). <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1739</font></span></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_251"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 251</font></a></p>  
 <p>On this the heart of the overseer greatly rejoiced <a name="fr_677"></a><a href="#fn_677"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and he made religious offerings to Buddha, the law, and the church. Buddha now leaving the city gate went on towards the river Ganges. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1740</font></span></p>  
 <p>The overseer from his deep reverence for Buddha named the gate (through which the lord had passed) the 'Gautama gate <a name="fr_678"></a><a href="#fn_678"><font size="1">2</font></a>.' Meanwhile the people all by the side of the river Ganges went forth to pay reverence to the lord of the world. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1741</font></span></p>  
 <p>They prepared for him every kind of religious offering, and each one with his gaudy boat (decorated boat) <a name="fr_679"></a><a href="#fn_679"><font size="1">3</font></a> invited him to cross over. The lord of the world, considering the number of the boats, feared lest by an appearance of partiality in accepting one, he might hurt the minds of all the rest. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1742</font></span></p>  
 <p>Therefore in a moment by his spiritual power he transported himself and the great congregation (across the river), leaving this shore he passed at once to that, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1743</font></span></p>  
 <p>Signifying thereby the passage in the boat of wisdom <a name="fr_680"></a><a href="#fn_680"><font size="1">4</font></a> (from this world to Nirvâ<i>n</i>a), a boat large enough to transport all that lives (to save the world), even as without a boat he crossed without hindrance the river (Ganges). <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1744</font></span></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_252"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 252</font></a></p>  
 <p>Then all the people on the bank of the river, with one voice, raised a rapturous shout <a name="fr_681"></a><a href="#fn_681"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and all declared this ford should be called the Gautama ford. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1745</font></span></p>  
 <p>As the city gate is called the Gautama gate, so this Gautama ford is so known through ages; and shall be so called through generations to come <a name="fr_682"></a><a href="#fn_682"><font size="1">2</font></a>. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1746</font></span></p>  
 <p>Then Tathâgata, going forward still, came to that celebrated Kuli <a name="fr_683"></a><a href="#fn_683"><font size="1">3</font></a> village, where he preached and converted many; again he went on to the Nâdi <a name="fr_684"></a><a href="#fn_684"><font size="1">4</font></a> village, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1747</font></span></p>  
 <p>Where many deaths had occurred among the people. The friends of the dead then came (to the lord) and asked, 'Where have our friends and relatives deceased, now gone to be born, after this life ended <a name="fr_685"></a><a href="#fn_685"><font size="1">5</font></a>?' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1748</font></span></p>  
 <p>Buddha, knowing well the sequence of deeds, answered each according to his several case. Then going forward to Vai<i>s</i>âlî  <a name="fr_686"></a><a href="#fn_686"><font size="1">6</font></a>, he located himself in the Âmra grove <a name="fr_687"></a><a href="#fn_687"><font size="1">7</font></a>. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1749</font></span></p>  
 <p>The celebrated Lady Âmrâ, well affected to Buddha, went to that garden followed by her waiting</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_253"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 253</font></a></p>  
 <p>women, whilst the children from the schools <a name="fr_688"></a><a href="#fn_688"><font size="1">1</font></a> paid her respect. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1750</font></span></p>  
 <p>Thus with circumspection and self-restraint, her person lightly and plainly clothed, putting away all her ornamented robes and all adornments of scent and flowers, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1751</font></span></p>  
 <p>As a prudent and virtuous woman goes forth to perform her religious duties, so she went on, beautiful to look upon, like any Devî in appearance. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1752</font></span></p>  
 <p>Buddha seeing the lady in the distance approaching, spake thus to all the Bhikshus <a name="fr_689"></a><a href="#fn_689"><font size="1">2</font></a>: 'This woman is indeed exceedingly beautiful, able to fascinate the minds (feelings) of the religious; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1753</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Now then, keep your recollection straight! let wisdom keep your mind in subjection! Better fall into the fierce tiger's mouth, or under the sharp knife of the executioner, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1754</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Than to dwell with a woman and excite in yourselves lustful thoughts. A woman is anxious to exhibit her form and shape <a name="fr_690"></a><a href="#fn_690"><font size="1">3</font></a>, whether walking, standing, sitting, or sleeping. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1755</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Even when represented as a picture, she desires most of all to set off the blandishments of her beauty, and thus to rob men of their steadfast heart! How then ought you to guard yourselves? <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1756</font></span></p>  
 <p>'By regarding her tears and her smiles as enemies, her stooping form, her hanging arms, and all her disentangled hair as toils designed to entrap man's heart. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1757</font></span></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_254"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 254</font></a></p>  
 <p>'Then how much more (should you suspect) her studied, amorous beauty! when she displays her dainty outline, her richly ornamented form, and chatters gaily with the foolish man! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1758</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Ah, then! what perturbation and what evil thoughts, not seeing underneath the horrid, tainted shape, the sorrows of impermanence, the impurity, the unreality! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1759</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Considering these as the reality, all lustful thoughts die out; rightly considering these, within their several limits, not even an Apsaras would give you joy. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1760</font></span></p>  
 <p>'But yet the power of lust is great with men, and is to be feared withal; take then the bow of earnest perseverance, and the sharp arrow points of wisdom, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1761</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Cover your head with the helmet of right-thought, and fight with fixed resolve against the five desires. Better far with red-hot iron pins bore out both your eyes, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1762</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Than encourage in yourselves lustful thoughts, or look upon a woman's form with such desires. Lust beclouding a man's heart, confused with woman's beauty, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1763</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The mind is dazed, and at the end of life that man must fall into an "evil way." Fear then the sorrow of that "evil way!" and harbour not the deceits of women. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1764</font></span></p>  
 <p>'The senses not confined within due limits, and the objects of sense not limited as they ought to be, lustful and covetous thoughts grow up between the two, because the senses and their objects are unequally yoked. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1765</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Just as when two ploughing oxen are yoked</p>  
 <p><a name="page_255"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 255</font></a></p>  
 <p>together to one halter and cross-bar, but not together pulling as they go, so is it when the senses and their objects are unequally matched. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1766</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Therefore, I say, restrain the heart, give it no unbridled license.' Thus Buddha, for the Bhikshus' sake, explained the law in various ways. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1767</font></span></p>  
 <p>And now that Âmrâ lady gradually approached the presence of the lord; seeing Buddha seated beneath a tree, lost in thought and wholly absorbed by it, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1768</font></span></p>  
 <p>She recollected that he had a great compassionate heart, and therefore she believed he would in pity receive her garden grove. With steadfast heart and joyful mien and rightly governed feelings, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1769</font></span></p>  
 <p>Her outward form restrained, her heart composed, bowing her head at Buddha's feet, she took her place as the lord bade her, whilst he in sequence right declared the law: <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1770</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Your heart (O lady!) seems composed and quieted, your form without external ornaments; young in years and rich, you seem well-talented as you are beautiful. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1771</font></span></p>  
 <p>'That one, so gifted, should by faith be able to receive the law of righteousness is, indeed, a rare thing in the world! The wisdom of a master <a name="fr_691"></a><a href="#fn_691"><font size="1">1</font></a>, derived from former births, enables him to accept the law with joy, this is not rare; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1772</font></span></p>  
 <p>'But that a woman, weak of will, scant in wisdom, deeply immersed in love, should yet be able to delight in piety, this, indeed, is very rare. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1773</font></span></p>  
 <p>'A man born in the world, by proper thought comes to delight in goodness, he recognises the</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_256"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 256</font></a></p>  
 <p>impermanence of wealth and beauty, and looks upon religion as his best ornament. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1774</font></span></p>  
 <p>'He feels that this alone can remedy the ills of life and change the fate of young and old; the evil destiny that cramps another's life cannot affect him, living righteously; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1775</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Always removing that which excites desire, he is strong in the absence of desire; seeking to find, not what vain thoughts suggest, but that to which religion points him. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1776</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Relying on external help, he has sorrow; self-reliant, there is strength and joy. But in the case of woman, from another comes the labour, and the nurture of another's child. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1777</font></span></p>  
 <p>'Thus then should every one consider well, and loath and put away the form of woman.' Âmrâ the lady, hearing the law, rejoiced. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1778</font></span></p>  
 <p>Her wisdom strengthened, and still more enlightened, she was enabled to cast off desire, and of herself dissatisfied with woman's form, was freed from all polluting thoughts. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1779</font></span></p>  
 <p>Though still constrained to woman's form, filled with religious joy, she bowed at Buddha's feet and spoke: 'Oh! may the lord, in deep compassion, receive from me, though ignorant, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1780</font></span></p>  
 <p>'This offering, and so fulfil my earnest vow.' Then Buddha knowing her sincerity, and for the good of all that lives, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1781</font></span></p>  
 <p>Silently accepted her request, and caused in her full joy, in consequence; whilst all her friends attentive, grew in knowledge, and, after adoration, went back home. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">. 1782</font></span></p>

 <p><a name="fn_673"></a><a href="sbe1924.htm#fr_673">249:2</a> This lady is called Ambapâlî, the courtezan, in the southern records.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_674"></a><a href="sbe1924.htm#fr_674">249:3</a> Pâ<i>t</i>aliputra, so called, as it seems, from a flower, pâ<i>t</i>ali (Bignonia suaveolens). It was otherwise called Kusumapura, 'the city of flowers.' The Palimbothra of the Greeks, Arrian, Hist. Ind. p. 324 (ed. Gronovii); supposed to be the modern Patna. The story found in the text, viz. that the place was an unfortified village or frontier station of Magadha when Buddha was seventy-nine years old, compared with the statement that in the time of Megasthenes it was one of the largest and most prosperous towns of India (Arrian, as above), seems to show that some considerable time had elapsed between the Nirvâ<i>n</i>a and the period of the Greek conquest. It is singular however (as I stated in Buddhist Pilgrims, p. lxiv) that Fă-hien in his account of this town (cap. xxvii) makes no allusion to the Buddhist council said to have been held there under Dharmâ<i>s</i>oka. (For further notice of Pâ<i>t</i>aliputra, compare Sacred Books of the East, vol. xi, pp. 16, 17; also Bigandet, p. 257, and Spence Hardy, passim.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_675"></a><a href="sbe1924.htm#fr_675">249:4</a> There is no mention of the Pâ<i>t</i>ali <i>k</i>etiya (unless the rest-house is the same as the Ketiya hall) in the Mahâ-parinibbâna-Sutta, but in Bigandet, p. 257, it is stated that the people prepared the 'dzeat,' or hall, for his use. This 'dzeat' had been erected by <a name="page_250"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 250</font></a> king Agâta<i>s</i>atru for receiving the Li<i>k</i><i>kh</i>avi princes of Vai<i>s</i>âlî, who had come to a conference at this place to settle their affairs with the king. This hall is probably represented at A<i>g</i>antâ, Cave xvi (see Burgess' Report, vol. i, plate xiii, fig. 2; also Mrs. Speirs' Ancient India, p. 197); at least it would seem so from the exact account left us of the position Buddha took on this occasion, 'he entered the hall and took his seat against the central pillar of the hall' (Rhys Davids and Bigandet in loc.) Does this hall, built by king Agâta<i>s</i>atru, and called in our text a 'Ketiya hall,' bear any resemblance to a Basilica?</p>
 <p><a name="fn_676"></a><a href="sbe1924.htm#fr_676">250:1</a> Rhys Davids (Sacred Books of the East, vol. xi, p. 18) tells us that 'the chief magistrates of Magadha Sunîdha and Vassakâra were building a fortress at Pâ<i>t</i>aligâma to repel the Va<i>g</i><i>g</i>ians;' I have therefore in my translation supposed the '<i>k</i>u kwŏ' and the 'yang kwan' to be the two officers referred to. It would seem that these titles 'ruling the country' and 'overseer' were recognised at the time. The text, however, would bear another translation, making the Brahman ruler the same as the omen-taking overseer.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_677"></a><a href="sbe1924.htm#fr_677">251:1</a> The account here given is less exact than that of the Mahâ-parinibbâna-Sutta, and it would seem as if it were borrowed from a popular form of that work.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_678"></a><a href="sbe1924.htm#fr_678">251:2</a> This is in agreement with the Southern account (see Rhys Davids, Sacred Books of the East, vol. xi, p. 2 r).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_679"></a><a href="sbe1924.htm#fr_679">251:3</a> There is no mention here made of the river being 'brimful and overflowing' as in the Southern books, nor of the search for rafts of wood or basket-work.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_680"></a><a href="sbe1924.htm#fr_680">251:4</a> Compare the account given by Rhys Davids (Sacred Books of the East, vol. xi, p. 21) and the verse or song there preserved.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_681"></a><a href="sbe1924.htm#fr_681">252:1</a> Or rather 'shouted out, "miraculous!"'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_682"></a><a href="sbe1924.htm#fr_682">252:2</a> Is there any name corresponding to the 'Gautama' ford known near Patna?</p>
 <p><a name="fn_683"></a><a href="sbe1924.htm#fr_683">252:3</a> No doubt the same as Ko<i>t</i>igâma (op. cit., p. 23) called Kantikama by Bigandet, p. 259.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_684"></a><a href="sbe1924.htm#fr_684">252:4</a> 'Come, Ânanda, let us go to the villages of Nâdika,' Rhys Davids, p. 24.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_685"></a><a href="sbe1924.htm#fr_685">252:5</a> The names of the dead are given in the Pâli; the account here is evidently an abstract only.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_686"></a><a href="sbe1924.htm#fr_686">252:6</a> 'Come, Ânanda, let us go on to Vesâli.' Rh. D., p. 28.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_689"></a><a href="sbe1924.htm#fr_689">253:2</a> This sermon against 'woman's wiles' is not found in the Pâli.</p>
