 <p>1. Now at that time, since there was a great company of the Bhikkhus gathered together at Sâvatthi, those Bhikkhus who had been placed on probation did not know how to carry out their probation correctly.</p>  
 <p>They told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I prescribe to you, O Bhikkhus, to carry out your probation correctly. Now thus, O Bhikkhus, ought you to postpone <a name="fr_721"></a><a href="#fn_703"><font size="1">5</font></a> the probation. The Bhikkhu who has been placed on probation is to go up to a single Bhikkhu, and arranging his robe on one shoulder, and squatting down on his heels, and stretching forth his hands with the palms together, he is to say: "I postpone my probation."

 <p>They told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I prescribe to you, O Bhikkhus, to take upon yourselves again the probation (which had been postponed). Now thus, O Bhikkhus, ought you to take it upon yourselves again. The Bhikkhu who has been placed under probation is to go up to a single Bhikkhu, and arranging his robe on one shoulder, and squatting down on his heels, and stretching forth his hands with the palms together, he is to say: "I take my probation again upon myself." Then the probation is resumed. Or he is to say: "I take the duties (i.e. of a probationer) upon myself again." Then also is the probation resumed.'</p>
