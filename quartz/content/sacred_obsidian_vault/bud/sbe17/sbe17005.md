 <p>1. Now at that time the Blessed One walked up and down in the open air <a name="fr_37"></a><a href="#fn_37"><font size="1">3</font></a> unshod. Noticing that, 'The Master walks unshod,' the Elders (the Thera Bhikkhus) also went unshod when they were walking up and down <a name="fr_38"></a><a href="#fn_37"><font size="1">3</font></a>. But though the Master and the Thera Bhikkhus went unshod, the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus walked up and down with coverings on their feet.</p>

 <p>The temperate Bhikkhus were annoyed, murmured, and became angry, saying, 'How can these <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus walk shod, when the Master and the Thera Bhikkhus walk unshod?'</p>  
 <p>2. Then those Bhikkhus told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'Is it true, what they say, O Bhikkhus, that the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus walk shod, though the Master and the Elders walk unshod?'</p>  
 <p>'It is true, Lord.'</p>  
 <p>The Blessed Buddha rebuked them, saying,</p>  
 <p>'How, O Bhikkhus, can these foolish persons walk shod, though (&amp;c., as in §§ 1, 2). For even the lay-men, O Bhikkhus, who are clad in white, for the sake of some handicraft that may procure them a living, will be respectful, affectionate, hospitable to their teachers. [3.] Do you, therefore, O Bhikkhus, so let (your light) shine forth, that you having left the world (to enter into) so well taught a doctrine and discipline may be respectful, affectionate, hospitable to your teachers (â<i>k</i>ariyas), or those who rank as teachers <a name="fr_39"></a><a href="#fn_38"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and to your superiors (upa<i>g</i><i>gh</i>âyas), or those who rank as superiors <a name="fr_40"></a><a href="#fn_39"><font size="1">2</font></a>. This will not conduce, O Bhikkhus, to the conversion of the unconverted, and to the augmentation of the number of the converted:</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_19"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 19</font></a></p>  
 <p>but it will result, O Bhikkhus, in the unconverted being repulsed (from the faith), and in many of the converted becoming estranged.' Having thus rebuked them, and having delivered a religious discourse, he thus addressed the Bhikkhus:</p>  
 <p>None of you, O Bhikkhus, is to walk shod, when your teachers or those who rank as teachers, or your superiors, or those who rank as superiors, are walking unshod. Whosoever does so, is guilty of a dukka<i>t</i>a offence.</p>  
 <p>'And no one of you, O Bhikkhus, is to wear shoes in the open Ârâma. Whosoever does so, is guilty of a dukka<i>t</i>a offence.'</p>
