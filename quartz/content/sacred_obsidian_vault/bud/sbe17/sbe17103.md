 <p><a name="fn_515"></a><a href="sbe17103.htm#fr_524">274:1</a> The ukkhepaniyakamma âpattiyâ appa<i>t</i>inissagge (expulsion for a Bhikkhu's refusal to atone for an offence) is spoken of here exactly in the same terms as those in which the ukkhepaniyakamma âpattiyâ adassane (expulsion for a Bhikkhu's refusal to see an offence) is spoken of in the preceding clause. The brethren say to the pretended offender, 'You have committed an offence, friend; atone for that offence'--which he refuses to do.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_516"></a><a href="sbe17103.htm#fr_525">274:2</a> As above; the Bhikkhus institute the ukkhepaniyakamma pâpikâya di<i>t</i><i>th</i>iyâ appa<i>t</i>inissagge (expulsion for a Bhikkhu's refusal to renounce a false doctrine).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_517"></a><a href="sbe17103.htm#fr_526">275:1</a> As in § 2, the first and second of the three cases given in § 1 are combined, so follow now combinations of the first and third, the second and third, and of the first, second, and third cases respectively.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_518"></a><a href="sbe17103.htm#fr_527">275:2</a> Here follow again the cases of the ukkhepaniyakamma âpattiyâ appa<i>t</i>inissagge and pâpikâya di<i>t</i><i>th</i>iyâ appa<i>t</i>inissagge, and the combinations of the three cases as above.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_519"></a><a href="sbe17103.htm#fr_528">275:3</a> Here follow the two other cases, together with the combinations of the three, exactly as above.</p>
