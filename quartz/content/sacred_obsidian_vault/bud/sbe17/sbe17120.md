 <p>1. Now at that time the venerable Seyyasaka was stupid, and indiscreet, and full of faults, and devoid of merit, and was living in lay society in unlawful association with the world <a name="fr_622"></a><a href="#fn_610"><font size="1">1</font></a>. So much so that the Bhikkhus were worn out <a name="fr_623"></a><a href="#fn_611"><font size="1">2</font></a> with placing him on probation <a name="fr_624"></a><a href="#fn_612"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and with throwing him back to the beginning (of his probationary term) <a name="fr_625"></a><a href="#fn_613"><font size="1">4</font></a>, and with subjecting him to the mânatta discipline <a name="fr_626"></a><a href="#fn_614"><font size="1">5</font></a>, and with rehabilitating him <a name="fr_627"></a><a href="#fn_615"><font size="1">6</font></a>.

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> (saying), 'How can the venerable Seyyasaka be so stupid (&amp;c., as before), that the Bhikkhus are worn out (&amp;c., as before)?'</p>  
 <p>Then those Bhikkhus told that matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>And the Blessed One on that occasion, and in that connection, convened a meeting of the Bhikkhusa<i>m</i>gha, and asked the Bhikkhus, 'Is it true, O Bhikkhus, as they say, that the venerable Seyyasaka is stupid (&amp;c., as before, down to) with rehabilitating him?'</p>  
 <p>'It is true, Lord!'</p>  
 <p>The Blessed Buddha rebuked him (saying), 'This is improper' (&amp;c., as usual, compare I, 2, 3, down to), and addressed the Bhikkhus, and said, 'Let the Sa<i>m</i>gha therefore, O Bhikkhus, carry out the Nissaya-kamma (Act of Subordination) against the venerable Seyyasaka: "Thou must remain under the superintendence of others <a name="fr_628"></a><a href="#fn_616"><font size="1">1</font></a>."</p>  
 <p>2. 'Now thus, O Bhikkhus, should it be carried out. In the first place the Bhikkhu Seyyasaka ought to be warned; when he has been warned, he ought to be reminded <a name="fr_629"></a><a href="#fn_617"><font size="1">2</font></a>; when he has been reminded, he ought to be charged with the offence <a name="fr_630"></a><a href="#fn_617"><font size="1">2</font></a>; when he has been charged with the offence, some discreet and able Bhikkhu ought to lay the matter before the Sa<i>m</i>gha (saying),</p>  
 <p>"Let the venerable Sa<i>m</i>gha hear me (&amp;c., as usual; see above, chapters 1. 4. and 8. 2)."'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_610"></a><a href="sbe17120.htm#fr_622">343:1</a> There is no rule in the Pâtimokkha in which any of these things are declared to be an offence. The 31st and 85th Pâ<i>k</i>ittiyas only refer to a Bhikkhu's staying an unreasonable time in a public rest-house, and to his frequenting a village beyond the ordinary occasions. Stupidity, and keeping low company, are not mentioned. Why then should Seyyasaka have been placed upon probation? We think the answer will appear from our note I on II, I, X.</p>
