 <p>1. Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu had an eruption <a name="fr_41"></a><a href="#fn_40"><font size="1">1</font></a> on his feet. They used to carry that Bhikkhu out when he wanted to ease himself. The Blessed One as he was passing through the sleeping places (of the Bhikkhus) saw them (doing so), and going up to them, he said:</p>  
 <p>2. 'What is the disease, O Bhikkhus, from which this Bhikkhu suffers?'</p>  
 <p>This venerable brother has an eruption on his feet, Lord, and we are carrying him out to ease himself.'</p>

 <p>'I enjoin, O Bhikkhus, the use of foot coverings</p>
