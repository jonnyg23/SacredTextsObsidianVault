 <p>1. And the Blessed One, after having dwelt at Benares as long as he thought fit, went forth to Andhakavinda, accompanied by a great number of Bhikkhus, by twelve hundred and fifty Bhikkhus. At that time the people in the country, after having loaded their carts with much salt and oil and rice and hard food, followed from behind the fraternity of Bhikkhus with the Buddha at its head (thinking), 'When our turn comes, we will make a meal for them;' and five hundred people who ate the remains of (the Bhikkhus') food (followed on their way). And the Blessed One, wandering from place to place, came to Andhakavinda.</p>  
 <p>2. Now a certain Brâhma<i>n</i>a, whose turn did not come, thought: 'Two months have elapsed while I have been following the fraternity of Bhikkhus with the Buddha at its head, in order to make a meal for them when my turn comes, but my turn does not come. I am alone here, and many household affairs of mine are going to ruin. What if I were to look into the provision-room, and what I should not see in the provision-room, to prepare that (for the Bhikkhus)!' Then that Brâhma<i>n</i>a looked into the provision-room and did not see there two (sorts of food), rice-milk and honey-lumps.</p>  
 <p>3. And that Brâhma<i>n</i>a went to the place where the venerable Ânanda was; having approached him, he said to the venerable Ânanda: 'As my turn did not come, my dear Ânanda, I thought: "Two months have elapsed (&amp;c., down to:). What if I were to look into the provision-room, and what I should not</p>  
 <p><a name="page_88"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 88</font></a></p>  
 <p>see in the provision-room, to prepare that!" Thus, my dear Ânanda, I looked into the provision-room and did not see there two (sorts of food), rice-milk and honey-lumps. If I were to prepare, my dear Ânanda, rice-milk and honey-lumps (for the Bhikkhus), would the reverend Gotama accept it from me?'</p>  
 <p>'Well, my good Brâhma<i>n</i>a, I will ask the Blessed One.'</p>  
 <p>4. And the venerable Ânanda told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'Well, Ânanda, let him prepare (those dishes).'</p>  
 <p>'Well, my good Brâhma<i>n</i>a, you may prepare (those dishes).'</p>  
 <p>And when the night had elapsed, that Brâhma<i>n</i>a had abundant rice-milk and honey-lumps prepared, and offered them to the Blessed One (in the words): 'May the reverend Gotama accept from me this rice-milk and honey-lumps.'</p>  
 <p>'Well, my good Brâhma<i>n</i>a, give it to the Bhikkhus.' The Bhikkhus, fearing to offend, did not accept it. 'Accept it, O Bhikkhus, and eat it.'</p>  
 <p>Then that Brâhma<i>n</i>a with his own hands served and offered abundant rice-milk and honey-lumps to the fraternity of Bhikkhus with the Buddha at its head; and when the Blessed One had <a href="errata.htm#0">washed</a> his hands, when he had cleansed his bowl and his hands, he sat down near him.</p>  
 <p>5. When he was seated near him, the Blessed One said to that Brâhma<i>n</i>a: 'Tenfold, O Brâhma<i>n</i>a, is the merit attached to rice-milk. In what way is it tenfold? He who gives rice-milk, gives life; he gives colour; he gives joy; he gives strength; he gives readiness of mind; rice--milk when it is drunk removes hunger; dispels thirst;</p>  
 <p><a name="page_89"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 89</font></a></p>  
 <p>sets right the humors of the body; purifies the bladder; and promotes the digestion. This ten-fold merit, O Brâhma<i>n</i>a, is attached to rice-milk.</p>  
 <p>6. 'He who attentively at the right time gives rice-milk to the self-possessed, who live on what others give to them, will benefit them in ten ways: life and colour, joy and strength (he gives to them);</p>  
 <p>'Readiness of mind arises from it; it dispels hunger and thirst, and sets the humors right; it purifies the bladder, and brings the food to digestion. As medicine the Perfect One has praised it.</p>  
 <p>'Therefore should rice-milk be continually given by a man who is longing for joy, who is desirous of heavenly joy, or who aspires to human prosperity.'</p>  
 <p>7. And the Blessed One, having gladdened that Brâhma<i>n</i>a by these stanzas, rose from his seat and went away.</p>  
 <p>And in consequence of this event the Blessed One, after having delivered a religious discourse, thus addressed the Bhikkhus: 'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, (to partake of) rice-milk and honey-lumps.'</p>
