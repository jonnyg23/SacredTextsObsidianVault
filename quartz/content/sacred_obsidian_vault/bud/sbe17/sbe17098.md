 <p>1. Now at that time the venerable Revata sent a robe to the venerable Sâriputta in charge of a certain Bhikkhu, saying, 'Give this robe to the' Thera.' But that Bhikkhu, whilst on the way, took the robe himself in trust on the venerable Revata <a name="fr_485"></a><a href="#fn_477"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>Now the venerable Revata, on meeting with the</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_252"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 252</font></a></p>  
 <p>venerable Sâriputta, asked him, saying, 'I sent to the venerable Thera a robe. Did that robe come into his hands?'</p>  
 <p>'I know nothing, friend, about that robe.'</p>  
 <p>Then the venerable Revata said to that Bhikkhu: 'I sent a robe, my friend, in your charge to the Thera. Where is that robe?'</p>  
 <p>'I took the robe myself, Lord, in trust upon you.'</p>  
 <p>They told the matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>2. 'In case, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu send a robe in charge of a Bhikkhu, saying, "Give this robe to such and such a Bhikkhu;" and he, whilst on the way, takes it himself in trust on the one who sends it--then it is rightly taken. But if he takes it himself in trust on the one to whom it was sent, it is wrongly taken.</p>  
 <p>'[The same repeated, the latter case being put first, and the former case last.]</p>  
 <p>'Moreover in case, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu send a robe in charge of a Bhikkhu, saying, "Give this robe to such and such a Bhikkhu;" and he, whilst on the way, hears that that Bhikkhu who sent it is dead;--then if he keeps the robe himself <a name="fr_486"></a><a href="#fn_478"><font size="1">1</font></a> as the robe of a deceased Bhikkhu, it is rightly kept; if he takes it himself in trust on the one to whom it was sent, it is wrongly taken.</p>  
 <p>'[In the same case], if he, whilst on the way, hears that that Bhikkhu to whom it was sent is dead--then if he keeps the robe himself as the robe of a deceased Bhikkhu, it is wrongly kept; if he takes</p>

 <p><a name="page_253"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 253</font></a></p>  
 <p>it himself in trust on the one who sent it, it is rightly taken.</p>  
 <p>[In the same case, if he hears, whilst on the way, that both are dead--then if he keeps it himself as the robe of a deceased Bhikkhu, to wit, the one who sent it, it is rightly kept; if he keeps it himself as the property of a deceased Bhikkhu, to wit, the one to whom it was sent, it is wrongly kept.]</p>  
 <p>3. 'Moreover in case, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu send a robe in charge of a Bhikkhu, saying, "I give the robe to such and such a Bhikkhu"--then [in all the cases given in § 2 the decision is reversed] <a name="fr_487"></a><a href="#fn_479"><font size="1">1</font></a>.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_479"></a><a href="sbe17098.htm#fr_487">253:1</a> The reason of all this is, that if the sender (A) says to the messenger (B), 'Give this robe to the sendee (C),' the property in the robe does not pass; if A says to B, 'I give this robe to C,' it does pass.</p>
