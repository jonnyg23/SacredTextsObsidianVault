 <p>1. 'Now in case, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu have committed two Sa<i>m</i>ghâdisesa offences [&amp;c., as before, in the first paragraph of the last chapter down to the end]. And he asks the Sa<i>m</i>gha for a probation of two months for that other offence concealed for two months.

 <p>concealed for two months <a name="fr_738"></a><a href="#fn_717"><font size="1">1</font></a>. That Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, ought to continue on probation for two months from that date.</p>  
 <p>2. 'Now in case, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu have committed two Sa<i>m</i>ghâdisesa offences, which he has concealed for two months. And he is aware of one offence, but of the other offence he is not aware. And he asks the Sa<i>m</i>gha for a two months' probation for that offence of which he is aware, concealed for two months. And the Sa<i>m</i>gha gives him a probation of two months for an offence concealed for two months. And whilst he is undergoing that probation he becomes aware of the other offence. Then it occurs to him,</p>  
 <p>Lo! I have committed two Sa<i>m</i>ghâdisesa offences (&amp;c., as in the last paragraph, down to) I became aware of the other offence. Let me now ask the Sa<i>m</i>gha for a probation of two months for that other offence concealed for two months."</p>  
 <p>And he asks the Sa<i>m</i>gha for a probation of two months for that other offence concealed for two months. And the Sa<i>m</i>gha imposes upon him a probation of &amp;c. . . . for &amp;c. . . . That Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, ought to continue on probation for two months from that date.</p>  
 <p>3. 'Now in case, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu commit two Sa<i>m</i>ghâdisesa offences, which he conceals for two months; and one offence he recollects, but the other offence he does not recollect. And he asks the Sa<i>m</i>gha (&amp;c., as in the last section, down to the end, reading "recollect" for "be aware of").</p>

 <p>4. 'Now in case, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu commit two Sa<i>m</i>ghâdisesa offences, which he conceals for two months; and of one offence he is not doubtful <a name="fr_739"></a><a href="#fn_718"><font size="1">1</font></a>, but of the other offence he is doubtful. And he asks the Sa<i>m</i>gha (&amp;c., as in the last section, reading "is doubtful" for "does not recollect").</p>  
 <p>5. 'Now in case, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu commit two Sa<i>m</i>ghâdisesa offences, which he conceals for two months; and one offence he conceals wittingly, but the other offence he conceals unwittingly. And he asks the Sa<i>m</i>gha for a probation of two months for those two offences concealed for two months. And the Sa<i>m</i>gha imposes upon him a probation of two months for those, two offences concealed for two months. And whilst he is undergoing that probation there arrives a Bhikkhu who is versed in the traditions, acquainted with the tradition, a custodian of the Dhamma, of the Vinaya, and of the Mâtikâs <a name="fr_740"></a><a href="#fn_719"><font size="1">2</font></a>, clever, discreet, wise, modest, sensitive, willing to learn. And he speaks thus:</p>  
 <p>"What has this Bhikkhu, O friends, been guilty of, and why is he on probation?"</p>  
 <p>'And they reply: "This Bhikkhu, O friend, has committed two Sa<i>m</i>ghâdisesa offences, which he concealed for two months; and one offence he concealed wittingly, and one offence he concealed unwittingly, He asked the Sa<i>m</i>gha for a probation of two months for those two offences concealed for two months. And the Sa<i>m</i>gha imposed upon him a probation of two months for those two offences concealed</p>

 <p>for two months. Therein, O friend, is this Bhikkhu guilty, and therefore is he on probation."</p>  
 <p>'And he rejoins: "The offence which he wittingly concealed, O friends, for that the imposition of a probation is valid, and by reason of its validity it takes effect <a name="fr_741"></a><a href="#fn_720"><font size="1">1</font></a>. But the offence which he unwittingly concealed, O friends, for that the imposition of a probation is invalid, and by reason of its invalidity it does not take effect. For this offence, O friends, the Bhikkhu is liable to a Mânatta."</p>  
 <p>6. 'In case, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu commit two Sa<i>m</i>ghâdisesa offences, which he conceals for two months. And one offence he conceals recollecting it, but the other offence he conceals without recollecting it.'</p>
