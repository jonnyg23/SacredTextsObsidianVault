You are to make endeavour to get sufficient material from rags taken from the dust-heap <a name="fr_398"></a><a href="#fn_393"><font size="1">4</font></a>, or from bits picked up in the bazaar <a name="fr_399"></a><a href="#fn_393"><font size="1">4</font></a>. I allow you, O Bhikkhus, slips of cloth inserted bolt-like to hold a torn robe</p>
