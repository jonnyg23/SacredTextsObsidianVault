 <p>1. Now at that time two Bhikkhus were journeying along a high road in the country of Kosala. And they came to a certain residence, and there one of the two fell ill. Then the Bhikkhus there thought: 'Waiting upon the sick has been highly spoken of by the Blessed One. Let us then, friends, now wait upon this Bhikkhu.' And they waited upon him, and while he was being nursed by them, he completed his time <a name="fr_465"></a><a href="#fn_457"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Then those Bhikkhus took that Bhikkhu's bowl and his robes, and went to Sâvatthi, and told the matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'On the death of a Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, the Sa<i>m</i>gha becomes the owner of his bowl and of his robes. But, now, those who wait upon the sick are of much service. I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that the bowl and the set of robes are to be assigned by the</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Sa<i>m</i>gha to them who have waited upon the sick. And thus, O Bhikkhus, are they to be assigned. The Bhikkhu who has waited upon the sick ought to go before the Sa<i>m</i>gha, and to say thus: "Such and such a Bhikkhu, Sirs, has completed his time. These are his set of robes and his bowl." Then a discreet and able Bhikkhu ought to lay the proposition before the Sa<i>m</i>gha, saying, "Let the Sa<i>m</i>gha hear me. Such and such a Bhikkhu has completed his time. These are his set of robes and his bowl. If it is convenient to the Sa<i>m</i>gha, let the Sa<i>m</i>gha assign this set of robes and this bowl to those who have waited upon the sick." This is the <i>ñ</i>atti.' [Here follow the usual formal words of a kammavâ<i>k</i>â <a name="fr_466"></a><a href="#fn_458"><font size="1">1</font></a>.]</p>  
 <p>3. Now at that time a certain Sâma<i>n</i>era had completed his time.</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>[The decision and the kammavâ<i>k</i>â are the same as in §2.]</p>  
 <p>4. Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu and a Sâma<i>n</i>era waited upon a sick Bhikkhu; and while he was being waited upon by them he completed his time. And the Bhikkhu who had waited upon the sick thought: 'How now ought the due portion of robes be given to the Sâma<i>n</i>era who waited upon the sick?'</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you are to give an equal portion to a Sâma<i>n</i>era who waits upon the sick.'</p>  
 <p>5. Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu who was</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_245"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 245</font></a></p>  
 <p>possessed of much property, and of a plentiful supply of a Bhikkhu's requisites, completed his time.</p>  
 <p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'On the death of a Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, the Sa<i>m</i>gha becomes the owner of his bowl and of his robes. But, now, those who wait upon the sick are of much service. I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that the set of robes and the bowl are to be assigned by the Sa<i>m</i>gha to them who have waited upon the sick. And whatever little property and small supply of a Bhikkhu's requisites there may be, that is to be divided by the Sa<i>m</i>gha that are present there; but whatever large quantity of property and large supply of a Bhikkhu's requisites there may be, that is not to be given away <a name="fr_467"></a><a href="#fn_459"><font size="1">1</font></a> and not to be apportioned <a name="fr_468"></a><a href="#fn_460"><font size="1">2</font></a>, but to belong to the Sa<i>m</i>gha of the four directions <a name="fr_469"></a><a href="#fn_461"><font size="1">3</font></a>, those who have come in, and those who have not <a name="fr_470"></a><a href="#fn_462"><font size="1">4</font></a>.'</p>
