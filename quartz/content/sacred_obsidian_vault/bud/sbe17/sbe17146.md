 <p>1. Now at that time the Blessed Buddha was staying at Sâvatthi, in the <i>G</i>etavana, Anâthapi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika's Grove. And at that time Bhikkhus who had been placed on probation <a name="fr_696"></a><a href="#fn_678"><font size="1">1</font></a> used to accept reverence and service and salutation and respect from regular Bhikkhus; and to allow them to provide a seat, or a sleeping-place, or water for the feet, or a foot-stool, or a foot-towel for them; and to carry their bowl or their robe, and to shampoo them <a name="fr_697"></a><a href="#fn_679"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_385"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 385</font></a></p>  
 <p>Those Bhikkhus who were moderate were annoyed, murmured, and became indignant, saying, 'How can Bhikkhus who have been placed on probation accept reverence (&amp;c., as above, down to) shampoo them?'</p>  
 <p>And those Bhikkhus told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>Then the Blessed One on that occasion, and in that connection, convened a meeting of the Bhikkhusa<i>m</i>gha, and asked the Bhikkhus: 'Is it true, O Bhikkhus, as they say, that Bhikkhus who have been placed on probation accept reverence (&amp;c., as before, down to) shampoo them?'</p>  
 <p>'It is true, Lord.'</p>  
 <p>The Blessed Buddha rebuked them, saying, 'How can those Bhikkhus (&amp;c., as before, down to) shampoo them? This will not conduce, O Bhikkhus (&amp;c., as usual, down to) <a name="fr_698"></a><a href="#fn_680"><font size="1">1</font></a> turning back of those who have been converted.'</p>  
 <p>And when he had rebuked them, and had delivered a religious discourse, he addressed the Bhikkhus, saying, 'A Bhikkhu who has been placed on probation ought not to accept reverence (&amp;c., as before, down to) shampoo them. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<i>t</i>a offence. I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, to those Bhikkhus who have been placed on probation to do [all the courtesies, duties, and services mentioned above <a name="fr_699"></a><a href="#fn_681"><font size="1">2</font></a>] for one another, according to their seniority. I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, five things (as permissible) to Bhikkhus who have been placed on probation,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_386"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 386</font></a></p>  
 <p>according to their seniority; (that is to say), the Uposatha ceremony, the Pavâra<i>n</i>â ceremony, the share in robes for the rainy season, in things dedicated to the Sa<i>m</i>gha <a name="fr_700"></a><a href="#fn_682"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and in food.</p>  
 <p>2. 'Therefore, O Bhikkhus, do I make known to you a rule of conduct for Bhikkhus who have been placed on probation, according to which they ought to conduct themselves aright. And herein this is the right conduct. He ought not to confer the Upasampadâ (&amp;c., as above, in I, 1, 5, down to the end) <a name="fr_701"></a><a href="#fn_683"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>A. Bhikkhu who has been placed on probation ought not, O Bhikkhus, to walk in front of, or to sit down in front of, a regular Bhikkhu. Whichever belonging to that company of Bhikkhus shall be the worst seat <a name="fr_702"></a><a href="#fn_684"><font size="1">3</font></a>, or the worst sleeping-place, or the worst room <a name="fr_703"></a><a href="#fn_685"><font size="1">4</font></a>, that shall be given to that Bhikkhu, and there-</p>

 <p>

 <p><a name="page_387"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 387</font></a></p>  
 <p>with shall he content himself. A Bhikkhu who has been placed under probation ought not, O Bhikkhus, to visit the families who support a regular Bhikkhu (by officiating, in order to do so, as the companion who precedes or follows that regular Bhikkhu)--he ought riot to devote himself to a forest life--he ought not to devote himself to living on alms personally received <a name="fr_704"></a><a href="#fn_686"><font size="1">1</font></a>--he ought not to cause an alms to be brought out to him with the object of escaping an extension of his probationary term <a name="fr_705"></a><a href="#fn_687"><font size="1">2</font></a>, thinking, "Let them not recognise me" (as one who has been placed under probation) <a name="fr_706"></a><a href="#fn_688"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>'A Bhikkhu who has been placed on probation ought, O Bhikkhus, to announce the fact of his having been so placed when he arrives at a residence as an incoming Bhikkhu--he ought to announce the fact to an incoming Bhikkhu--he ought to announce the fact at an Uposatha meeting--he ought to announce the fact at a Pavâra<i>n</i>â meeting--and, if he be sick, he ought to announce the fact at such meetings by means of a messenger <a name="fr_707"></a><a href="#fn_689"><font size="1">4</font></a>.</p>

'A Bhikkhu who has been placed on probation ought not, O Bhikkhus, to go away from a residence in which Bhikkhus are living to a residence in which no Bhikkhus are living, unless with a regular Bhikkhu, or in time of danger. A Bhikkhu who has been placed on probation ought not, O Bhikkhus, to go away from a residence in which Bhikkhus are living to a place which is not a residence <a name="fr_708"></a><a href="#fn_690"><font size="1">1</font></a> and where no Bhikkhus are living, unless with a regular Bhikkhu, or in time of danger. A Bhikkhu (&amp;c., as before) ought not to go away from a residence in which Bhikkhus are living, either to a residence or to a place which is not a residence, and where Bhikkhus are not living, unless (&amp;c., as before) <a name="fr_709"></a><a href="#fn_691"><font size="1">2</font></a>. . . . from a place which is not a residence, but where Bhikkhus are living, to a place which is a residence, but where Bhikkhus are not living . . . . from a place which is not a residence, but where Bhikkhus are living, to a place which is not a residence and where Bhikkhus are not living . . . . from a place which is no residence, but where Bhikkhus are living, either to a place which is not a residence or to a residence where no Bhikkhus are living . . . . from a place which is either a residence or not a residence, to a place which is a residence, but where no Bhikkhus are living . . . . from a place which is either a residence or no residence, but where Bhikkhus are living, to a place</p>

[The same changes as in the last series are here rung upon this inhibition, down to] . . . . from a place which is either a residence or not a residence, but where Bhikkhus. are living, to a place which is either a residence or not a residence, and where Bhikkhus are living, but where there may be Bhikkhus of different communities from his own (unless, &amp;c., as before).</p>

[Here follow the same permutations and combinations as in the last two series.]</p>

 <p>ought to rise from his seat <a name="fr_710"></a><a href="#fn_692"><font size="1">1</font></a>; and he ought to offer his seat to a regular Bhikkhu. He ought not to sit down on one and the same seat with a regular Bhikkhu; when a regular Bhikkhu is seated on a low seat he ought not to sit down on a high seat <a name="fr_711"></a><a href="#fn_693"><font size="1">2</font></a>; when a regular Bhikkhu is seated on the ground he ought not to sit down on a seat <a name="fr_712"></a><a href="#fn_694"><font size="1">3</font></a>; he ought not to walk up and down on the same <i>k</i>aṅkama <a name="fr_713"></a><a href="#fn_695"><font size="1">4</font></a> with a regular Bhikkhu; when a regular Bhikkhu is walking up and down on a low <i>k</i>aṅkama he ought not to walk up and down on a higher <i>k</i>aṅkama; when a regular Bhikkhu is walking up and down on the ground he ought not to walk up and down on a (properly prepared) <i>k</i>aṅkama.</p>  
 <p>A Bhikkhu who has been placed on probation ought not, O Bhikkhus, to dwell (&amp;c., all the other acts mentioned in the last paragraph being here repeated down to the end) with a Bhikkhu senior to himself who has been placed on probation . . . . with a Bhikkhu who has been thrown back to the commencement of his term of probation . . . . with a Bhikkhu who has rendered himself liable to the Mânatta discipline <a name="fr_714"></a><a href="#fn_696"><font size="1">5</font></a> . . . . with a Bhikkhu undergoing the Mânatta discipline . . . . with a Bhikkhu who is in a position to receive rehabilitation'.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_678"></a><a href="sbe17146.htm#fr_696">384:1</a> There are four principal kinds of probation; the first of which was required when the follower of another of the reforming sects was received into the Buddhist Order, and is described in Mahâvagga I, 38. The other three, which follow on the commission of a Sa<i>m</i>ghâdisesa offence, are more particularly described below in the third Khandhaka. The Pâli names of these four are respectively apa<i>t</i>i<i>k</i><i>kh</i>anna-parivâsa, pa<i>t</i>i<i>k</i><i>kh</i>anna-parivâsa, suddhanta-parivâsa, and samodhâna-parivâsa.</p>  
 <p>No conclusion should be drawn against this statement from the passage above at I, 9, 1; though Seyyasaka's conduct, as there described, would not have rendered him liable to any one of these four principal probationary proceedings. For he is said to have been guilty of many offences (âpatti-bahulo). The accompanying enumeration must be taken, not as a description of those offences, but as additional to them. And the probation imposed upon him must have been for concealing one or more of the many offences not particularly specified.</p>
