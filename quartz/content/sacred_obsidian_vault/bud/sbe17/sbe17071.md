 <p>3. At that time a number of Bhikkhus were travelling on the road in the Kosala country. Some of these Bhikkhus went aside first from (the road) to a cemetery in order to get themselves pa<i>m</i>sukûla robes; some (other) Bhikkhus went aside later. Those Bhikkhus who had gone first to the cemetery for pa<i>m</i>sukûla robes, got themselves pa<i>m</i>sukûlas; those Bhikkhus who had got off later, did not get any, and said (to the other ones): 'Friends, give us also a part.' They replied, 'We will not give you a part, friends; why did you get off (to the cemetery) after us?'</p>  
 <p>They told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you are not obliged to give a part against your will to Bhikkhus who have gone (to the cemetery) later (than yourselves).'</p>

 <p>They told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you give a part (even) against your will to Bhikkhus who have gone (to the cemetery) together with yourselves.'</p>  
 <p>5. At that time a number of Bhikkhus were travelling on the road in the Kosala country.

They replied, 'We will not give you a part, friends; why did you not get (them yourselves)?'</p>
