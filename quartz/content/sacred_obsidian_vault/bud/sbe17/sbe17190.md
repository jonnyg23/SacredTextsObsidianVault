 <p>In the 7th Nissaggiya, in the 34th Pâ<i>k</i>ittiya, and in the 36th Pâ<i>k</i>ittiya there occurs the phrase abhiha<i>t</i><i>th</i>u<i>m</i> pavâreyya, regarding the correct translation of which, as will be seen from the note on the first passage, we were in doubt. The connection is always 'if A should offer B,' &amp;c.; and the only difficulty is the force of the word abhiha<i>t</i><i>th</i>u<i>m</i> which precedes the 'should offer,' and in some way qualifies it. In all three passages the Old Commentary preserved in the Sutta-Vibhaṅga explains the two words abhiha<i>t</i><i>th</i>u<i>m</i> pavâreyya by 'Take just as much as you want' (yâvataka<i>m</i> i<i>k</i><i>kh</i>asi tâvataka<i>m</i> ga<i>n</i>hâhi), which does not solve the difficulty. On the following words of the third passage, however, the Old Commentary (see H. O., 'Vinaya Pitaka<i>m</i>,' vol. iv, p. 84) uses the word abhiharati in its usual sense of 'he brings up to, offers to, hands over to,' as practically equivalent to abhiha<i>t</i><i>th</i>u<i>m</i> pavâreti; and Buddhaghosa, in the Samanta Pâsâdikâ on the 7th Nissaggiya, uses abhiharitvâ as directly equivalent to abhiha<i>t</i><i>th</i>u<i>m</i>.</p>  
 <p>Now in a passage quoted from the Thera-gâthâ in H. O.'s 'Buddha, sein Leben, seine Lehre, and seine Gemeinde' (p. 425, note 1), nikkhamitu<i>m</i>na occurs as the gerund of nikkhamati instead of nikkhamitvâna. The existence in Prâkrit of corresponding gerunds in -tu, -tu<i>m</i> for -tvâ, and in -tû<i>n</i>a, -tuâ<i>n</i>a for -tvâna, is laid down in Hema<i>k</i>andra II, 146 (Pischel, vol. i, p. 62). And Professor Weber has given corresponding forms (âha<i>t</i><i>t</i>u, ka<i>t</i><i>t</i>u, &amp;c.) from the <i>G</i>ain dialect in his Bhagavatî I, p. 433.</p>  
 <p>What we have in the phrase in question is therefore simply a gerund in -tu<i>m</i>, and the two words taken together mean, 'if A should lay before and offer to B,' &amp;c. The thing offered in one case is robes, in the other two cases food; and abhiharati is the usual word in Pâli for serving food, laying it before another person. Compare thâli-pâka-satâni abhihari at <i>G</i>âtaka I, 186; and the phrase bhattâbhihâro abhihâriyittha constantly repeated in the Mahâ-sudassana Sutta (Rh. D., 'Buddhist Suttas,' in the last paragraph of chap. II, § 12, 29, 31, 33, 37).</p>    </body>
