 <p>1. Now at that time the venerable Pilindava<i>k</i><i>kh</i>a had head-ache <a name="fr_132"></a><a href="#fn_130"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of a little oil on the head.'</p>  
 <p>(The disease) became no better <a name="fr_133"></a><a href="#fn_131"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the practice of taking up (medicine) through the nose <a name="fr_134"></a><a href="#fn_132"><font size="1">4</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>

 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_54"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 54</font></a></p>  
 <p>The nose ran.</p>  
 <p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of a nose-spoon <a name="fr_135"></a><a href="#fn_133"><font size="1">1</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>Now at that time the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus had various kinds of nose-spoons--made of gold, and of silver. People were annoyed, murmured, and became angry, saying, 'Like those who still live in the world.'</p>  
 <p>They told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'Various kinds of nose-spoons, O Bhikkhus, are not to be used. Whosoever does so, is guilty of a dukka<i>t</i>a offence. I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of such nose-spoons made of bone (&amp;c., as in chap. 12. 1, down to:) or of the chank-shell.'</p>  
 <p>2. The nose took up the medicament in unequal proportions.</p>  
 <p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of a double nose-spoon <a name="fr_136"></a><a href="#fn_134"><font size="1">2</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>(The disease) became no better.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to sniff up the aroma.'</p>  
 <p>They used to spread the drugs on a wick before they sniffed up the aroma <a name="fr_137"></a><a href="#fn_135"><font size="1">3</font></a>: and their throats got burnt.</p>  
 <p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of a pipe to conduct the aroma.'</p>  
 <p>Now at that time the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus had various kinds of pipes (&amp;c., as in the last clauses of § 1, down to the end).</p>  
 <p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_55"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 55</font></a></p>  
 <p>Now at that time the aroma-pipes came open: and worms got in.</p>  
 <p>I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of a lid to the pipes.'</p>  
 <p>Now at that time the Bhikkhus carried the pipes about in their hands.</p>  
 <p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of a bag to carry the aroma-pipes in.'</p>  
 <p>The aroma-pipes rubbed against one another.</p>  
 <p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of a double bag.'</p>  
 <p>They had no shoulder strap.</p>  
 <p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of a shoulder strap (by which to carry the double bag), or of a thread (by which to sew it on).'</p>
