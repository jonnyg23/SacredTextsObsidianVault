 <p>1. At that time the blessed Buddha dwelt at Râ<i>g</i>agaha, in the Ve<i>l</i>uvana, in the Kalandaka-nivâpa. At that time Vesâlî was an opulent, prosperous town, populous, crowded with people, abundant with food <a name="fr_336"></a><a href="#fn_331"><font size="1">1</font></a>; there were seven thousand seven hundred and seven storeyed buildings, and seven thousand seven hundred and seven pinnacled buildings, and seven thousand seven hundred and seven pleasure grounds (Ârâmas), and seven thousand seven hundred and seven lotus-ponds. There was also the courtezan Ambapâlikâ <a name="fr_337"></a><a href="#fn_332"><font size="1">2</font></a>, who was beautiful, graceful, pleasant, gifted with the highest beauty of complexion, well versed in dancing, singing, and lute-playing, much visited by desirous people. She asked fifty (kahâpa<i>n</i>as) for one night. Through that person Vesâlî became more and more flourishing.</p>  
 <p>2. Now a merchant from Râ<i>g</i>agaha went to Vesâlî on a certain business. That Râ<i>g</i>agaha merchant saw what an opulent, prosperous town Vesâlî was, how populous, crowded with people, and abundant with food, and the seven thousand seven</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_172"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 172</font></a></p>  
 <p>hundred and seven storeyed buildings . . . . and the courtezan Ambapâlî, who was beautiful . . . . and through whom Vesâlî became more and more flourishing. And the Râ<i>g</i>agaha merchant, after having done his business in Vesâlî, returned to Râ<i>g</i>agaha and went to the place where the Mâgadha king Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisâra was. Having approached him, he said to the Mâgadha king Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisâra: 'Vesâlî, Your Majesty, is an opulent, prosperous town (&amp;c., as in § 1, down to:) Through that person Vesâlî becomes more and more flourishing. May it please Your Majesty, let us also install a courtezan.'</p>  
 <p>(The king replied), 'Well, my good Sir, look for such a girl whom you can install as courtezan.'</p>  
 <p>3. Now at that time there was at Râ<i>g</i>agaha a girl Sâlavatî by name, who was beautiful, graceful, pleasant, and gifted with the highest beauty of complexion. That girl Sâlavatî the Râ<i>g</i>agaha merchant installed as courtezan. And before long the courtezan Sâlavatî was well versed in dancing, singing, and lute-playing, and much visited by desirous people, and she asked one hundred (kahâpa<i>n</i>as) for one night. And before long the courtezan Sâlavatî became pregnant. Now the courtezan Sâlavatî thought: 'Men do not like a pregnant woman. If anybody should find out regarding me that "The courtezan Sâlavatî is pregnant," my whole position will be lost. What if I were to have the people told that I am sick.'</p>  
 <p>And the courtezan Sâlavatî gave orders to the door-keeper (saying), 'Let no man enter here, my good door-keeper, and if a man calls for me, tell him that I am sick.' The door-keeper accepted</p>  
 <p><a name="page_173"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 173</font></a></p>  
 <p>this of the courtezan Sâlavatî (by saying), Yes, Madam.'</p>  
 <p>4. And the courtezan Sâlavatî, when the child in her womb had reached maturity, gave birth to a boy. And the courtezan Sâlavatî gave orders to her maid-servant (saying), 'Go, my girl, put this boy into an old winnowing basket, take him away, and throw him away on a dust-heap.' The servant accepted this order of the courtezan Sâlavatî (by saying), 'Yes, Madam,' put that boy into an old winnowing basket, took him away, and threw him away on a dust-heap.</p>  
 <p>At that time a royal prince, Abhaya by name <a name="fr_338"></a><a href="#fn_333"><font size="1">1</font></a>, went betimes to attend upon the king, and saw that boy, around whom crows were gathering. When he saw that, he asked the people: 'What is that, my good Sirs, around which the crows are gathering?'</p>  
 <p>It is a boy, Your Highness  <a name="fr_339"></a><a href="#fn_334"><font size="1">2</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>'Is he alive, Sirs?'</p>  
 <p>'He is alive, Your Highness.'</p>  
 <p>'Well, my good Sirs, bring that boy to our palace and give him to the nurses to nourish him.'</p>  
 <p>And those people accepted that order of the royal prince Abhaya (by saying), 'Yes, Your Highness,' brought that boy to the palace of the royal prince Abhaya, and gave him to the nurses (saying),</p>  
 <p>'Nourish (this boy).'</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_174"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 174</font></a></p>  
 <p>Because (the people had said about this boy to Abhaya), 'He is alive' (<i>g</i>îvati), they gave him the name of <i>G</i>îvaka; because he had been caused to be nourished by the royal prince (kumârena posâpito), they gave him the name of Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a <a name="fr_340"></a><a href="#fn_335"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>5. And ere long <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a came to the years of discretion. And <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a went to the place where the royal prince Abhaya was; having approached him he said to the royal prince Abhaya: 'Who is my mother, Your Highness, and who is my father?'</p>  
 <p>'I do not know your mother, my good <i>G</i>îvaka, but I am your father, for I have had you nourished.'</p>  
 <p>Now <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a thought: 'In these royal families it is not easy to find one's livelihood without knowing an art. What if I were to learn an art.'</p>  
 <p>6. At that time there lived at Takkasilâ (Τάξιλα) a world-renowned physician. And <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a without asking leave of the royal prince Abhaya set out for Takkasilâ. Wandering from place to place he came to Takkasilâ and to the place where</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_175"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 175</font></a></p>  
 <p>that physician was. Having approached him he said to that physician, 'I wish to learn your art, doctor.</p>  
 <p>'Well, friend <i>G</i>îvaka, learn it.'</p>  
 <p>And <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a learnt much, and learnt easily, and understood well, and did not forget what he had learnt. And when seven years had elapsed, <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a thought: 'I learn much, and learn easily, and I understand well, and I do not forget what I have learnt. I have studied now seven years, and I do not see the end of this art. When shall I see the end of this art?'</p>  
 <p>7. And <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a went to the place where that physician was; having approached him he said to that physician: 'I learn much, doctor, and I learn easily; I understand well, and do not forget what I have learnt. I have studied now seven years, and I do not see the end of this art. When shall I see the end of this art?'</p>  
 <p>'Very well, my dear <i>G</i>îvaka, take this spade, and seek round about Takkasilâ a yo<i>g</i>ana on every side, and whatever (plant) you see which is not medicinal, bring it to me.'</p>  
 <p><i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a accepted this order of that physician (saying), 'Yes, doctor,' took a spade, and went around about Takkasilâ a yo<i>g</i>ana on every side, but he did not see anything that was not medicinal. Then <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a went to the place where that physician was; having approached him he said to that physician: 'I have been seeking, doctor, all around Takkasilâ a yo<i>g</i>ana on every side, but I have not seen anything that is not medicinal.'</p>  
 <p>(The physician replied), 'You have done your learning, my good <i>G</i>îvaka; this will do for acquiring your livelihood.' Speaking thus he gave to <i>G</i>îvaka</p>  
 <p><a name="page_176"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 176</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a a little (money) for his journey (home).</p>  
 <p>8. And <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a took that little money, given to him for his journey, and set out for Râ<i>g</i>agaha. And on the way at Sâketa that little money of <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a was spent. Now <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a thought: 'These ways are wild, and there is but little water and little food; it is difficult to travel here without money for the journey. What if I were to try to get some money for my journey.'</p>  
 <p>At that time the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's <a name="fr_341"></a><a href="#fn_336"><font size="1">1</font></a> wife at Sâketa had been suffering for seven years from disease in the head; many very great and world-renowned physicians came, but they could not restore her to health; they received much gold, and went away.</p>  
 <p>And <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a, when he had entered Sâketa, asked the people: 'Who is sick here, my good Sirs? Whom shall I cure?'</p>  
 <p>'That se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's wife, doctor, has been suffering for seven years from a disease in the head; go, doctor, and cure that se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's wife.'</p>  
 <p>9. Then <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a went to the house of that householder, the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i; and when he had reached it, he gave orders to the door-keeper (saying), 'Go, my good door-keeper, and tell the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's wife: "A physician has come in, Madam, who wants to see you."'</p>  
 <p>That door-keeper accepted this order of <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a (saying), 'Yes, doctor,' went to the place where the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's wife was, and having approached her, he said to the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's wife: 'A physician has come in, Madam, who wants to see you.'</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_177"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 177</font></a></p>  
 <p>'What sort of man is that physician, my good door-keeper?'</p>  
 <p>'He is a young man, Madam.'</p>  
 <p>'Nay, my good door-keeper, what can a young physician help me? Many very great and world-renowned physicians have come and have not been able to restore me to health; they have received much gold, and have gone away.'</p>  
 <p>10. Thus that door-keeper went to <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a; having approached him he said to <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a: 'The se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's wife has said, doctor: "Nay, my good door-keeper (&amp;c., as in § 9)."'</p>  
 <p>(<i>G</i>îvaka replied), 'Go, my good door-keeper, and tell the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's wife: "The physician, Madam, says: 'Do not give me anything beforehand, Madam when you shall have been restored to health, then you may give me what you like."'</p>  
 <p>The door-keeper accepted this order of <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a (saying), 'Yes, doctor,' went to the place where the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's wife was, and having approached her he said to the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's wife: 'The physician, Madam, says (&amp;c., as above).'</p>  
 <p>'Well, my good door-keeper, let the physician enter.'</p>  
 <p>The door-keeper accepted this order of the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's wife (saying), 'Yes, Madam,' went to the place where <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a was, and having approached him he said to <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a: 'The se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's wife calls you, doctor.'</p>  
 <p>11. Then <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a went to the place where the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's wife was; having approached her, and having carefully observed the change in the appearance of the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's wife, he said to the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_178"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 178</font></a></p>  
 <p>se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's wife: 'We want one pasata <a name="fr_342"></a><a href="#fn_337"><font size="1">1</font></a> of ghee, Madam.' Then the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's wife ordered one pasata of ghee to be given to <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a. And <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a boiled up that pasata of ghee with various drugs, ordered the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's wife to lie down on her back in the bed, and gave it her through her nose. And the butter given through the nose came out through the mouth. And the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's wife spat it out into the spittoon, and told the maid-servant: 'Come, my girl, take this ghee up with a piece of cotton.'</p>  
 <p>12. Then <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a thought: 'It is astonishing how niggardly this house-wife is, in that she has this ghee, which ought to be thrown away, taken up with a piece of cotton. I have given her many highly precious drugs. What sort of fee will she give me?'</p>  
 <p>And the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's wife, when she observed the change of demeanour in <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a, said to <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a: 'Why are you perplexed, doctor?'</p>  
 <p>'I thought: "It is astonishing, &amp;c."'</p>  
 <p>'Householders like us, doctor, know why to economize thus; this ghee will do for the servants or workmen to anoint their feet with, or, it can be poured into the lamp. Be not perplexed, doctor, you will not lose your fee.'</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_179"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 179</font></a></p>  
 <p>13. And <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a drove away the disease in the head which the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's wife had had for seven years, by once giving her medicine through the nose. Then the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's wife, who had been' restored to health, gave four thousand (kâhâpa<i>n</i>as) to <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a; her son (thinking), 'My mother stands there restored,' gave him four thousand; her daughter-in-law (thinking), 'My mother-in-law stands there restored,' gave him four thousand; the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i, the householder, (thinking), 'My wife stands there restored,' gave him four thousand and a man-servant and a maid-servant and a coach with horses.</p>  
 <p>Then <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a took those sixteen thousand (kâhâpa<i>n</i>as) and the man-servant, the maid-servant, and the coach with the horses, and set out for Râ<i>g</i>agaha. In due course he came to Râ<i>g</i>agaha, and to the place where the royal prince Abhaya was; having approached him he said to the royal prince Abhaya: 'This, Your Highness, (have I received for) the first work I have done, sixteen thousand and a man-servant and a maid-servant and a coach with horses; may Your Highness accept this as payment for my bringing up.'</p>  
 <p>'Nay, my dear <i>G</i>îvaka, keep it, but do not get a dwelling for yourself elsewhere than in our residence.'</p>  
 <p><i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a accepted this order of the royal prince Abhaya (saying), 'Yes, Your Highness,' and got himself a dwelling in the residence of the royal prince Abhaya.</p>  
 <p>14. At that time the Magadha king Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisâra suffered from a fistula; his garments were stained with blood. When the queens saw that,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_180"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 180</font></a></p>  
 <p>they ridiculed (the king, and said): 'His Majesty is having his courses. His Majesty will bring forth!' The king was annoyed at that. And the Magadha king Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisâra said to the royal prince Abhaya: 'I am suffering, my dear Abhaya, from such a disease that my garments are stained with blood; and the queens, when they see it, ridicule (me by saying), "His Majesty is, &amp;c." Pray, my dear Abhaya, find a physician for me, able to cure me.'</p>  
 <p>'This excellent young physician of ours, Sire, <i>G</i>îvaka, he will cure Your Majesty.'</p>  
 <p>'Then pray, my dear Abhaya, give orders to the physician <i>G</i>îvaka, and he shall cure me.'</p>  
 <p>15. Then the royal prince Abhaya gave orders to <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a (saying), 'Go, my dear <i>G</i>îvaka, and cure the king.'</p>  
 <p><i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a accepted this order of the royal prince Abhaya (by saying), 'Yes, Your Highness,' took some medicament in his nail, and went to the place where the Magadha king Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisâra was. Having approached him, he said to the Magadha king Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisâra: 'Let us see your disease, Your Majesty.' And <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a healed the fistula of the Magadha king Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisâra by one anointing.</p>  
 <p>Then the Magadha king Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisâra, having been restored to health, ordered his five hundred wives to put on all their ornaments; then he ordered them to take their ornaments off and to make a heap of them, and he said to <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a: 'All these ornaments, my dear <i>G</i>îvaka, of my five hundred wives shall be thine.'</p>  
 <p>'Nay, Sire, may Your Majesty remember my office.'</p>  
 <p><a name="page_181"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 181</font></a></p>  
 <p>'Very well, my dear <i>G</i>îvaka, you can wait upon me and my seraglio and the fraternity of Bhikkhus with the Buddha at its head.'</p>  
 <p><i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a accepted this order of the Magadha king Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisâra (by saying), 'Yes, Your Majesty.'</p>  
 <p>16. At that time the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i at Râ<i>g</i>agaha had been suffering for seven years from a disease in the head. Many very great and world-renowned physicians came, and were not able to restore him to health; they received much gold and went away. And a prognostication had been made by the physicians to him, to wit: Some of the physicians said: 'The se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i, the householder, will die on the fifth day;' other physicians said: 'The se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i, the householder, will die on the seventh day.'</p>  
 <p>Now (a certain) Râ<i>g</i>agaha merchant thought: 'This se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i, this householder, does good service both to the king and to the merchants' guild. Now the physicians have made prognostication to him(&amp;c., as above). There is <i>G</i>îvaka, the royal physician, an excellent young doctor. What if we were to ask the king for his physician <i>G</i>îvaka to cure the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i, the householder?'</p>  
 <p>17. And the Râ<i>g</i>agaha merchant went to the place where the Magadha king Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisâra was; having approached him, he said to the Magadha king Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisâra: That se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i, Sire, that householder, does good service both to Your Majesty and to the merchants' guild. Now the physicians have made prognostication to him, &amp;c. May it please Your Majesty to order the physician <i>G</i>îvaka to cure the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i, the householder.'</p>  
 <p>Then the Magadha king Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisâra gave</p>  
 <p><a name="page_182"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 182</font></a></p>  
 <p>orders to <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a (saying), 'Go, my dear <i>G</i>îvaka, and cure the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i, the householder.'</p>  
 <p><i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a accepted this order of the Magadha king Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisâra (by saying), 'Yes, Your Majesty,' went to the place where the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i, the householder, was, and having approached him, and having carefully observed the change in his appearance, he said to the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i, the householder: 'If I restore you to health, my good householder, what fee will you give me?'</p>  
 <p>'All that I possess shall be yours, doctor, and I will be your slave.'</p>  
 <p>18. 'Well, my good householder, will you be able to lie down on one side for seven months?'</p>  
 <p>'I shall be able, doctor, to lie down on one side for seven months.'</p>  
 <p>'And will you be able, my good householder, to lie down on the other side for seven months?'</p>  
 <p>'I shall be able, doctor, to lie down on the other side for seven months.'</p>  
 <p>'And will you be able, my good householder, to lie down on your back for seven months?'</p>  
 <p>'I shall be able, doctor, to lie down on my back for seven months.'</p>  
 <p>Then <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a ordered the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i, the householder, to lie down on his bed, tied him fast to his bed, cut through the skin of the head, drew apart the flesh on each side of the incision, pulled two worms out (of the wound), and showed them to the people (saying), 'See, Sirs, these two worms, a small one and a big one. The doctors who said, "On the fifth day the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i, the householder, will die," have seen this big worm, and how it would penetrate on the fifth day to the brain of</p>  
 <p><a name="page_183"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 183</font></a></p>  
 <p>the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i, the householder, and that when it had penetrated to the brain, the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i, the householder, would die. Those doctors have seen it quite rightly. And the doctors who said, "On the seventh day the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i, the householder, will die," have seen this small worm, and how it would penetrate on the seventh day to the brain of the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i, the householder, and that when it had penetrated to the brain, the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i, the householder, would die. Those doctors have seen it quite rightly.' (Speaking thus) he closed up the sides of the wound, stitched up the skin on the head, and anointed it with salve.</p>  
 <p>19. And when seven days had elapsed, the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i, the householder, said to <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a: 'I am not able, doctor, to lie down on one side for seven months.'</p>  
 <p>'Did you not tell me, my good householder: "I shall be able, doctor, to lie down on one side for seven months?"'</p>  
 <p>'It is true, doctor, I told you so indeed, but I shall die (if I do); I cannot lie down on one side for seven months.'</p>  
 <p>'Well, my good householder, then you must lie down on the other side for seven months.'</p>  
 <p>And when seven days had elapsed, the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i, the householder, said to <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a: 'I am not able, doctor, to lie down on the other side for seven months.'</p>  
 <p>'Did you not tell me, &amp;c.'</p>  
 <p>It is true, doctor, I told you so indeed, &amp;c.'</p>  
 <p>'Well, my good householder, then you must lie down on your back for seven months.'</p>  
 <p>And when seven days had elapsed, the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i, the householder, said to <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a: 'I am</p>  
 <p><a name="page_184"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 184</font></a></p>  
 <p>not able, doctor, to lie down on my back for seven months.'</p>  
 <p>Did you not tell me, &amp;c.?'</p>  
 <p>It is true, doctor, I told you so indeed, &amp;c.'</p>  
 <p>20. 'If I had not spoken thus to you, my good householder, you would not have lain down even so long a time. But I knew beforehand, "After three times seven days the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i, the householder, will be restored to health." Arise, my good householder, you are restored; look to it what fee you give me.'</p>  
 <p>'All that I possess shall be yours, doctor, and I will be your slave.'</p>  
 <p>'Nay, my good householder, do not give me all that you possess, and do not be my slave; give one hundred thousand (kâhâpa<i>n</i>as) to the king, and one hundred thousand to me.'</p>  
 <p>Then the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i, the householder, having regained his health, gave a hundred thousand (kâhâpa<i>n</i>as) to the king, and a hundred thousand to <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a.</p>  
 <p>21. At that time the son of the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i at Benares, who used to amuse himself by tumbling (mokkha<i>k</i>ikâ <a name="fr_343"></a><a href="#fn_338"><font size="1">1</font></a>), brought upon himself an entanglement of his</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_185"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 185</font></a></p>  
 <p>intestines, in consequence of which he could digest neither the rice-milk which he drank, nor the food of which he partook, nor was he able to ease himself in the regular way. In consequence of that he grew lean, he looked disfigured and discoloured, (his complexion became) more and more yellow, and the veins stood out upon his skin.</p>  
 <p>Now the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i of Benares thought: 'My son is suffering from such and such a disease: he neither can digest the rice-milk which he drinks (&amp;c., as above, down to:) and the veins stand out upon his skin. What if I were to go to Râ<i>g</i>agaha and to ask the king for his physician <i>G</i>îvaka to cure my son.'</p>  
 <p>And the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i of Benares went to Râ<i>g</i>agaha and repaired to the place where the Magadha king Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisâra was; having approached him he said to the Magadha king Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisâra: 'My son, Your Majesty, is suffering from such and such a disease: he neither can digest the rice-milk which he drinks (&amp;c., as above, down to:) and the veins stand out upon his skin. May it please Your Majesty to order the physician <i>G</i>îvaka to cure my son.'</p>  
 <p>22. Then the Magadha king Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisâra gave orders to <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a (saying), 'Go, my dear <i>G</i>îvaka; go to Benares, and cure the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's son at Benares.'</p>  
 <p><i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a accepted this order of the Magadha king Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisâra (by saying), 'Yes, Your Majesty,' went to Benares, and repaired to the place where the son of the Benares se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i was; having approached him, and having carefully</p>  
 <p><a name="page_r86"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. r86</font></a></p>  
 <p>observed the change in his appearance, he ordered the people to leave the room, drew the curtain, tied him fast to a pillar, placed his wife in front of him, cut through the skin of the belly, drew the twisted intestines out, and showed them to his wife (saying), 'Look here what the disease was, from which your husband was suffering. This is the reason why he neither can digest the rice-milk which he drinks, nor can digest the food of which he partakes, nor is able to ease himself in the regular way, and why he has grown lean, and looks disfigured and discoloured, and (why his complexion has become) more and more yellow, and the veins have stood out upon his skin.' (Speaking thus), he disentangled the twisted intestines, put the intestines back (into their right position), stitched the skin together, and anointed it with salve. And before long the Benares se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's son regained his health.</p>  
 <p>Then the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i of Benares (saying to himself), 'My son stands here restored to health,' gave sixteen thousand (kâhâpa<i>n</i>as) to <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a. And <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a took those sixteen thousand (kâhâpa<i>n</i>as), and went back again to Râ<i>g</i>agaha.</p>  
 <p>23. At that time king Pa<i>g</i><i>g</i>ota (of U<i>g</i><i>g</i>enî) was suffering from jaundice. Many very great and world-renowned physicians came and were not able to restore him to health; they received much gold and went away. Then king Pa<i>g</i><i>g</i>ota sent a messenger to the Magadha king Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisâra (with the following message): 'I am suffering from such and such a disease; pray, Your Majesty <a name="fr_344"></a><a href="#fn_339"><font size="1">1</font></a>, give</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_187"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 187</font></a></p>  
 <p>orders to the physician <i>G</i>îvaka; he will cure me.' Then the Magadha king Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisâra gave orders to <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a (saying), 'Go, my dear <i>G</i>îvaka; go to U<i>g</i><i>g</i>enî, and cure king Pa<i>g</i><i>g</i>ota.'</p>  
 <p><i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a accepted this order of the Magadha king Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisâra (by saying), 'Yes, Your Majesty,' went to U<i>g</i><i>g</i>enî and to the place where king Pa<i>g</i><i>g</i>ota was, and having approached him, and having carefully observed the change in his appearance, he said to king Pa<i>g</i><i>g</i>ota:</p>  
 <p>24. 'I will boil up some ghee, Sire, which Your Majesty must drink.'</p>  
 <p>'Nay, my good <i>G</i>îvaka; do what you can for restoring me without giving me ghee; I have an aversion and a distaste for ghee.'</p>  
 <p>Then <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a thought: 'The disease of this king is such a one that it cannot be cured without ghee. What if I were to boil up ghee so that it takes the colour, the smell, and the taste of an astringent decoction <a name="fr_345"></a><a href="#fn_340"><font size="1">1</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>Then <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a boiled some ghee with various drugs so as to give it the colour, the smell, and the taste of an astringent decoction. And <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a thought: 'When this king will shall have taken the butter and digested it, it will  make him vomit. This king is cruel; he might have me killed. What if I were to take leave before</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_188"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 188</font></a></p>  
 <p>hand.' And <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a went to the place where king Pa<i>g</i><i>g</i>ota was; having approached him he said to king Pa<i>g</i><i>g</i>ota:</p>  
 <p>25. 'We physicians, Sire, draw out roots and gather medical drugs at such an hour as this. May it please Your Majesty to send the following order to the (royal) stables, and to the gates (of the town): "Let <i>G</i>îvaka ride out on what animal he likes; let him leave (the town) by what gate he likes; let him leave at what hour he likes; let him enter again at what hour he likes."'</p>  
 <p>And king Pa<i>g</i><i>g</i>ota sent the following order to the (royal) stables and to the gates (of the town): 'Let <i>G</i>îvaka ride out on what animal he likes, &amp;c.'</p>  
 <p>At that time king Pa<i>g</i><i>g</i>ota had a she-elephant, called Bhaddavatikâ, which could travel fifty yoga<i>n</i>as (in one day). And <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a gave the ghee to king Pa<i>g</i><i>g</i>ota (saying), 'May Your Majesty drink this decoction.' Then, having made king Pa<i>g</i><i>g</i>ota drink the ghee, <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a went to the elephant stable, and hasted away from the town on the she-elephant Bhaddavatikâ.</p>  
 <p>26. And when king Pa<i>g</i><i>g</i>ota had drunk that ghee and was digesting it, it made him vomit. Then king Pa<i>g</i><i>g</i>ota said to his attendants: 'That wicked <i>G</i>îvaka, my good Sirs, has given me ghee to drink. Go, my good Sirs, and seek the physician <i>G</i>îvaka.'</p>  
 <p>(The attendants answered), 'He has run away from the town on the she-elephant Bhaddavatikâ.'</p>  
 <p>At that time king Pa<i>g</i><i>g</i>ota had a slave, Kâka by name, who could travel sixty yoga<i>n</i>as (in one day), who had been begotten by a non-human being. To this slave Kâka; king Pa<i>g</i><i>g</i>ota gave the order: 'Go, my good Kâka, and call the physician <i>G</i>îvaka back</p>  
 <p><a name="page_189"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 189</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> (saying), "The king orders you to return, doctor." But those physicians, my good Kâka, are cunning people; do not accept anything from him.'</p>  
 <p>27. And the slave Kâka overtook <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a on his way, at Kosambî, when he was taking his breakfast. And the slave Kâka said to <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a: 'The king orders you to return, doctor.'</p>  
 <p>(<i>G</i>îvaka replied), 'Wait, my good Kâka, until we have taken our meal; here, my good Kâka, eat.'</p>  
 <p>(Kâka said), 'Nay, doctor, the king has told me, "Those physicians, my good Kâka, are cunning people; do not accept anything from him."'</p>  
 <p>At that time <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a, who had cut off some drug with his nail, was eating an emblic myrobalan fruit and drinking water. And <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a said to the slave Kâka: 'Here, my good Kâka, eat of this myrobalan fruit and take some water.'</p>  
 <p>28. Then the slave Kâka thought: 'This physician eats the myrobalan and drinks the water; there cannot be any harm in it;' so he ate half of the myrobalan and drank some water. And that half myrobalan which (<i>G</i>îvaka) had given him to eat, opened his bowels on the spot.</p>  
 <p>Then the slave Kâka said to <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a: 'Can my life be saved, doctor?'</p>  
 <p>(<i>G</i>îvaka replied), 'Be not afraid, my good Kâka, you will be quite well. But the king is cruel; that king might have me killed; therefore do I not return.'</p>  
 <p>Speaking thus he handed over to Kâka the she-elephant Bhaddavatikâ and set out for Râ<i>g</i>agaha. Having reached Râ<i>g</i>agaha in due course, he went to</p>  
 <p><a name="page_190"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 190</font></a></p>  
 <p>the place where the Magadha king Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisâra was; having approached him he told the whole thing to the Magadha king Bimbisâra.</p>  
 <p>(Bimbisâra said), 'You have done right, my good <i>G</i>îvaka, that you have not returned; that king is cruel; he might have had you killed.'</p>  
 <p>29. And king Pa<i>g</i><i>g</i>ota, being restored to health, sent a messenger to <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a (with this message), 'May <i>G</i>îvaka come to me; I will grant him a boon.'</p>  
 <p>(<i>G</i>îvaka replied), 'Nay, Sir, may His Majesty remember my office.'</p>  
 <p>At that time king Pa<i>g</i><i>g</i>ota had a suit of Siveyyaka cloth <a name="fr_346"></a><a href="#fn_341"><font size="1">1</font></a>, which was the best, and the most excellent, and the first, and the most precious, and the noblest of many cloths, and of many suits of cloth, and of many hundred suits of cloth, and of many thousand suits of cloth, and of many hundred thousand suits of cloth. And king Pa<i>g</i><i>g</i>ota sent this suit of Siveyyaka cloth to <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a. Then <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a thought: 'This suit of Siveyyaka cloth which king Pa<i>g</i><i>g</i>ota has sent me, is the best and the most excellent (&amp;c., down to:) and of many hundred thousand suits of cloth.

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Arahat-Buddha, or the Magadha king Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisâra.'</p>  
 <p>30. At that time a disturbance had befallen the humors of the Blessed One's body. And the Blessed One said to the venerable Ânanda: 'A disturbance, Ânanda, has befallen the humors of the Tathâgata's body; the Tathâgata wishes to take a purgative.' Then the venerable Ânanda went to the place where <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a was; having approached him he said to <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a:</p>  
 <p>'My good <i>G</i>îvaka, a disturbance has befallen the humors of the Tathâgata's body; the Tathâgata wishes to take a purgative.'</p>  
 <p>(<i>G</i>îvaka replied), 'Well, venerable Ânanda, you ought to rub the Blessed One's body with fat for a few days.'</p>  
 <p>And the venerable Ânanda, having rubbed the Blessed One's body with fat for some days, went to the place where <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a was; having approached him he said to <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a: 'I have rubbed, my good <i>G</i>îvaka, the Tathâgata's body with fat; do you now what you think fit.'</p>  
 <p>31. Then <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a thought: 'It is not becoming that I should give a strong purgative to the Blessed One.' (Thinking thus), he imbued three handfuls of blue lotuses with various drugs and went therewith to the place where the Blessed One was; having approached him he offered one handful of lotuses to the Blessed One (saying), 'Lord, may the Blessed One smell this first handful of lotuses; that will purge the Blessed One ten times.' Thus he offered also the second handful of lotuses to the Blessed One (saying), 'Lord, may the Blessed One smell this second handful of lotuses;</p>  
 <p><a name="page_192"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 192</font></a></p>  
 <p>that will purge the Blessed One ten times.' Thus he offered also the third handful of lotuses to the Blessed One (saying), 'Lord, may the Blessed One smell this third handful of lotuses; that will purge the Blessed One ten times. Thus the Blessed One will have purged full thirty times.' And <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a, having given to the Blessed One a purgative for full thirty times, bowed down before the Blessed One, and passed round him with his right side towards him, and went away.</p>  
 <p>32. And <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a, when he was out of doors, thought: 'I have given indeed to the Blessed One a purgative for full thirty times, but as the humors of the Tathâgatha's body are disturbed, it will not purge the Blessed One full thirty times; it will purge the Blessed One only twenty-nine times. But the Blessed One, having purged, will take a bath; the bath will purge the Blessed One once; thus the Blessed One will be purged full thirty times.'</p>  
 <p>And the Blessed One, who understood by the power of his mind this reflection of <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a, said to the venerable Ânanda: '<i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a, Ânanda, when he was out of doors, has thought: "I have given indeed (&amp;c., as above, down to:) thus the Blessed One will be purged full thirty times." Well, Ânanda, get warm water ready.'</p>  
 <p>The venerable Ânanda accepted this order of the Blessed One (saying), 'Yes, Lord,' and got warm water ready.</p>  
 <p>33. And <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a went to the place where the Blessed One was; having approached him and respectfully saluted the Blessed One, he sat down near him; sitting near him <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a said to the Blessed One: 'Lord, has the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_193"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 193</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Blessed One purged?' (Buddha replied), 'I have purged, <i>G</i>îvaka' (<i>G</i>îvaka said), 'When I was out of doors, Lord, I thought: "I have given indeed, &amp;c." Lord, may the Blessed One take a bath, may the Happy One take a bath.' Then the Blessed One bathed in that warm water; the bath purged the Blessed One once; thus the Blessed One was purged full thirty times.</p>  
 <p>And <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a said to the Blessed One: 'Lord, until the Blessed One's body is completely restored, you had better abstain from liquid food.' And ere long the Blessed One's body was completely restored.</p>  
 <p>34. Then <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a took that suit of Siveyyaka cloth and went to the place where the Blessed One was; having approached him, and having respectfully saluted the Blessed One, he sat down near him. Sitting near him, <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a said to the Blessed One: 'Lord, I ask one boon of the Blessed One.' (Buddha replied), 'The Tathâgatas, <i>G</i>îvaka, are above granting boons (before they know what they are).' (<i>G</i>îvaka said), 'Lord, it is a proper and unobjectionable demand.'--'Speak, <i>G</i>îvaka.'</p>  
 <p>'Lord, the Blessed One wears only pa<i>m</i>sukûla robes (robes made of rags taken from a dust heap or a cemetery <a name="fr_347"></a><a href="#fn_342"><font size="1">1</font></a>), and so does the fraternity of Bhikkhus. Now, Lord, this suit of Siveyyaka cloth has been sent to me by king Pa<i>g</i><i>g</i>ota, which is the best, and the most excellent, and the first, and the most precious, and the noblest of many cloths and of</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_194"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 194</font></a></p>  
 <p>many suits of cloth, and of many hundred suits of cloth, and of many thousand suits of cloth, and of many hundred thousand suits of cloth. Lord, may the Blessed One accept from me this suit of Siveyyaka cloth, and may he allow to the fraternity of Bhikkhus to wear lay robes <a name="fr_348"></a><a href="#fn_343"><font size="1">1</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>The Blessed One accepted the suit of Siveyyaka cloth. And the Blessed One taught, incited, animated, and gladdened <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a by religious discourse. And <i>G</i>îvaka Komârabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a, having been taught, incited, animated, and gladdened by the Blessed One by religious discourse, rose from his seat, respectfully saluted the Blessed One, passed round him with his right side towards him, and went away.</p>  
 <p>35. And the Blessed One, after having delivered a religious discourse in consequence of that, thus addressed the Bhikkhus:</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to wear lay robes. He who likes may wear pa<i>m</i>sukûla robes; he who likes may accept lay robes. Whether you are pleased with the one or with the other sort <a name="fr_349"></a><a href="#fn_344"><font size="1">2</font></a> of robes, I approve it.'</p>  
 <p>Now the people at Râ<i>g</i>agaha heard, The Blessed One has allowed the Bhikkhus to wear lay robes.' Then those people became glad and delighted (because they thought), 'Now we will bestow gifts (on the Bhikkhus) and acquire merit by good works,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_195"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 195</font></a></p>  
 <p>since the Blessed One has allowed the Bhikkhus to wear lay robes.' And in one day many thousands of robes were presented at Râ<i>g</i>agaha (to the Bhikkhus).</p>  
 <p>And the people in the country heard, 'The Blessed One has allowed the Bhikkhus to wear lay robes.' Then those people became glad (&amp;c., as above, down to:) And in one day many thousands of robes were presented through the country also (to the Bhikkhus).</p>  
 <p>36. At that time the Sa<i>m</i>gha had received a mantle. They told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to wear a mantle.'</p>  
 <p>They had got a silk mantle.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to wear a silk mantle.'</p>

So also the name Kumâra-Kassapa is explained in the <i>G</i>âtaka commentary (Rh. D., 'Buddhist Birth Stories,' p. 204).

(Compare Rh. D., 'Buddhist Suttas from the Pâli,' p. 193.) The passage from Buddhaghosa is however not devoid of ambiguity. He says: 'Mokkha<i>k</i>ikâ is the feat of turning over and over. One gets hold of a staff in the air, and places his head on the ground; turning himself upside down. This is what is meant (by the word mokkha<i>k</i>ikâ).' It is not clear whether the performer suspends himself by his feet from a horizontal bar fixed at a height above the ground; or whether he turns a sommersault, holding at the same time a stick in his hands. The latter seems <a name="page_185"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 185</font></a> more in accordance with the phrase 'holding a stick in the air' (âkâse da<i>n</i><i>d</i>a<i>m</i> gahetvâ) and with the phrase 'turning over and over' (sampariva<i>t</i><i>t</i>ana<i>m</i>).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_341"></a><a href="sbe17068.htm#fr_346">190:1</a> Buddhaghosa gives two explanations of Siveyyaka<i>m</i> dussayuga<i>m</i>. 'Either Siveyyaka cloth means the cloth used in the Uttarakuru country for veiling the dead bodies when they are brought to the burying-ground (sivathikâ). (A certain kind of birds take the bodies to the Himavat mountains in order to eat them, and throw the cloths away. When eremites find them there, they bring them to the king.) Or Siveyyaka cloth means a cloth woven from yarn which skilful women in the Sivi country spin.' No doubt the latter explication is the right one.</p>
