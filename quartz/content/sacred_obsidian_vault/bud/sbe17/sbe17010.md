 <p>1. Now when the Blessed One had remained at Bhaddiya as long as he thought fit, he set out on a journey towards Sâvatthi. And walking from place to place he arrived at Sâvatthi. There the Blessed One dwelt at Sâvatthi at the <i>G</i>etavana, Anâtha-pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika's Grove.</p>  
 <p>2. Now at that time the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus used to catch hold of the heifers crossing on the A<i>k</i>iravatî River by their horns, or ears, or dewlaps, or tails <a name="fr_53"></a><a href="#fn_52"><font size="1">4</font></a>, or spring up upon their backs, or touch with lustful</p>

 <p>thoughts their privy parts: and they used to duck the young calves and so kill them. People were annoyed, murmured, and became angry, saying, 'How can the Sakyaputtiya Sama<i>n</i>as [act thus]? it is like men still enjoying the pleasures of the world.'</p>  
 <p>And Bhikkhus heard them murmuring in annoyance and indignation: and those Bhikkhus told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'Is it true' (&amp;c., see chap. 4. 2)?</p>  
 <p>'It is true, Lord.'</p>  
 <p>He rebuked them, and having delivered a religious discourse, he addressed the Bhikkhus, and said:</p>  
 <p align="justify'">'Heifers are not to be caught hold of, O Bhikkhus, by their horns, or their ears, or their dewlaps, or their tails. You are not to get up on their backs. Whosoever gets up on their backs, is guilty of a dukka<i>t</i>a offence. And their privy parts, O Bhikkhus, are not to be touched with lustful thoughts. Whosoever does so, is guilty of a thulla<i>k</i><i>k</i>aya offence. And calves ought not to be killed. Whosoever kills them, let him be dealt with according to law <a name="fr_54"></a><a href="#fn_53"><font size="1">1</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>3. Now at that time the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus used to have themselves carried in vehicles to which cows were yoked with a bull between them, or bulls were yoked with a cow between them <a name="fr_55"></a><a href="#fn_54"><font size="1">2</font></a>. People were annoyed, murmured, and became angry, saying, 'That is as is done at the Feast of the Gaṅgâ and the Mahî <a name="fr_56"></a><a href="#fn_55"><font size="1">3</font></a>.'</p>

 <p><a name="page_26"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 26</font></a></p>  
 <p>They told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'Do not have yourselves carried in vehicles, O Bhikkhus. Whosoever does so, is guilty of a dukka<i>t</i>a offence.'</p>
