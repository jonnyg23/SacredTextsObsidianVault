 <p>1. Now when the Blessed One had remained at Benares as long as he thought fit, he set out on his journey towards Bhaddiya. And wandering from place to place he came to Bhaddiya: and there, at Bhaddiya, he stayed in the <i>G</i>âtiyâ Grove.</p>  
 <p>Now at that time the Bhikkhus at Bhaddiya were accustomed to the use of various kinds of foot coverings for the sake of ornament. They made,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_23"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 23</font></a></p>  
 <p>or had made for themselves foot coverings of ti<i>n</i>a-grass, of mu<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>a-grass, of babba<i>g</i>a-grass, of the leaves of the date-palm <a name="fr_45"></a><a href="#fn_44"><font size="1">1</font></a>, of kamala-grass <a name="fr_46"></a><a href="#fn_45"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and of wool <a name="fr_47"></a><a href="#fn_46"><font size="1">3</font></a>. And they neglected <a name="fr_48"></a><a href="#fn_47"><font size="1">4</font></a> instruction, enquiry, morality, self-concentration, and wisdom <a name="fr_49"></a><a href="#fn_48"><font size="1">5</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>2. The moderate Bhikkhus were annoyed, murmured, and became angry, thinking, 'How can they [do so]?' And those Bhikkhus told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>  
 <p>'Is it true' (&amp;c., as in chap. 4. 2)?</p>  
 <p>'It is true, Lord.'</p>  
 <p>The Blessed Buddha rebuked them, saying, 'How can they [do so]?' This will not conduce (&amp;c., as in chap. 4. 2, down to:) becoming estranged.</p>  
 <p>3. Having thus rebuked them, and having delivered a religious discourse, he thus addressed the Bhikkhus: 'Shoes, O Bhikkhus, made of ti<i>n</i>a-grass are not to be worn, or made of mu<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>a-grass, or of babba<i>g</i>a-grass, or of leaves of the date-palm, or of kamala-grass, or of wool, nor [ornamented with] gold, or silver, or pearls, or beryls, or crystal, or copper, or glass, or tin, or lead, or bronze. Whosoever does so, is guilty of a dukka<i>t</i>a offence.</p>

 <p>'And clogs, O Bhikkhus, that are taken away <a name="fr_50"></a><a href="#fn_49"><font size="1">1</font></a>, are not to be worn. Whosoever does so, is guilty of a dukka<i>t</i>a offence.</p>  
 <p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of three kinds of clogs, that are fixed to the ground, and are not taken away <a name="fr_51"></a><a href="#fn_50"><font size="1">2</font></a>, privy-clogs, urinal-clogs, and rinsing-clogs <a name="fr_52"></a><a href="#fn_51"><font size="1">3</font></a>.'</p>

On the other two, <i>K</i>ullavagga V, 35; 1, 4, and VIII, 10, 3; and see also VIII, 9. The use of them was part of the sanitary arrangements enjoined upon the Order. A very ancient pair of stone va<i>k</i><i>k</i>a-pâdukâ, forming part of a slab of stone, was discovered at Anurâdhapura by Rhys Davids, and is now in the Colombo Museum. As they were dug up in one of the palaces there, they were probably for the use of the king, or some high official. These ruins are among the most ancient in Ceylon, and are certainly pre-Christian in date.</p>
