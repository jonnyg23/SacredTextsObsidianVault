 <p>2. 'And in case, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu is guilty of a number of Sa<i>m</i>ghâdisesa offences--definite, and not definite--of one designation, and of various designations--similar to each other, and dissimilar--connected with each other, and disconnected <a name="fr_775"></a><a href="#fn_752"><font size="1">1</font></a>. He asks the Sa<i>m</i>gha for an inclusive probation on account of those offences. The Sa<i>m</i>gha imposes upon him an additional probation on account of those offences.

 <p>of those intervening offences to the commencement of his term of probation. The Sa<i>m</i>gha [does so] by an unlawful proceeding that is liable to be quashed, and unfit for the occasion; and it also imposes an inclusive probation upon him, but by an unlawful proceeding. He thinking, "I am undergoing that probation," is guilty meanwhile of a number of Sa<i>m</i>ghâdisesa offences, definite ones, which he does conceal. When he has arrived at this condition he calls to mind the other offences committed while the first offences were being committed, and he calls to mind also the other offences committed while the latter offences were being committed.</p>  
 <p>Then it occurs to him, "I have been guilty of a number of Sa<i>m</i>ghâdisesa offences (&amp;c., as in the whole of the section from the beginning to the end of the last paragraph, down to) and I called to mind also the. other offences committed while the latter offences were being committed. Let me now ask the Sa<i>m</i>gha to throw me back on account of those offences committed while the former offences, and while the latter offences, were being committed, to the commencement of my term of probation, by a lawful proceeding that cannot be quashed, and is fit for the occasion; and let me ask for an inclusive probation to be imposed by a lawful proceeding, and for a Mânatta to be imposed by a lawful proceeding, and then for rehabilitation by a lawful proceeding."</p>  
 <p>'And he asks the Sa<i>m</i>gha [accordingly], and the Sa<i>m</i>gha [does so]. That Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, is purified from those offences.'</p>  
 <p>[The same if some of the offences in each case have been concealed and some not concealed.]</p>
