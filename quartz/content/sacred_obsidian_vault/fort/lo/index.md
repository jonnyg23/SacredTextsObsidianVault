 <dir><small>It is not exclusively anywhere where anything is, if ours is one organic existence, in which all things are continuous.--p. 769.</small></dir>
 <dir><small>I suspect that, in other worlds, or in other parts of one existence, there is esoteric knowledge of the human beings of this earth, kept back from common knowledge... There have been suggestions of an occult control upon the
 minds of the inhabitants of this earth. Let anybody who does
 not like the idea that his mind may be most subtly controlled,
 without his knowledge of it, think back to what propagandists did with his
 beliefs in the years 1914-18...--p. 617

 <p>
 In <cite>Lo!</cite>, Fort develops a theme of teleportation as
 an agency for many strange phenomena.
 He reviews the cases of the <i>Marie Celeste</i>, Princess Caraboo,
 Cagliostro, Ambrose Bierce, Agatha Christie,
 and Kaspar Hauser as evidence that people can
 be mysteriously teleported from one point to another.
 The main side effect of these accidental teleportations seems to be amnesia,
 in fact it is the <i>sine qua non</i> of the better examples.
 </p>
 <p>
 Fort continues to tweak scientific pomposity, focusing on astronomers.
 While astronomy bills itself as an exact science, even today,
 with digital computers, calculations can go awry,
 often because of human error and the limits of our mathematical models.
 A Mars probe was lost because one software component
 was using English measurements instead of metric.
 While multi-body systems can now be simulated digitally
 using iterative methods, eventually chaos creeps in and
 makes predicting future locations of planets impossible.
 Fort uses this Achilles heel to advance his own
 modest cosmological proposal, of a shell of land
 just a few dozen miles up, with the stars as volcanoes...
 </p>
 <p>
 Taken at face value, of course, he is dead wrong--even the builders
 of Stonehenge would have turned up their noses at this concept.
 However, Fort was vindicated in many large and small ways here.
 He predicted the space race, and how space
 travel would someday become commercialized and routine.
 His sense that the universe has a lot of strange components that 
 early 20th century science had no concept of, was also prescient.
 Today, we might use parallel universes to explain many of these phenomena.
 In fact, some mainstream theories of physics demand the existence
 of such universes.
 In fact, some of these universes may be separated from ours by the
 spatial equivalent of millimeters.
 Somewhere, I think, Mr. Fort is a bit less grumpy...
