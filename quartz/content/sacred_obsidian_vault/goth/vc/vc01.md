 <h4 align="CENTER">I. The Kheprian Charge</h4>
 <p>We are the many-born. We are the immortal. We have been known by many names throughout the ages, though few have understood the truth of our existence.</p>
 <p>Endlessly, we die and are reborn, changed yet unchanging throughout the ages. We move from lifetime to lifetime, taking up bodies as garments.</p>
 <p>We are watchers and we are wanderers.</p>
 <p><br>
 We seek knowledge and understanding above all.</p>
 <p>Long ago we strove the sunder the life of our body from our roving minds, for it grounded us. It held us back. It bound us to a single span of days. Through a ritual of death and rebirth, we severed our living ties and gained immortality.</p>
 <p>Now we are freed of the life of the body, but we are irrevocably tied to the life we cut away. It sustains us and empowers us.</p>
 <p>We thirst for life and we feed upon it.</p>
 <p><br>
 It is our greatest weakness and our greatest prize.</p>
