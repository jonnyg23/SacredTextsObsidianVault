   XV<br>
   Of Eroto-comatose Lucidity</h2>
 <p>The Candidate is made ready for the Ordeal by general athletic training, and 
   by feasting. On the appointed day he is attended by one or more chosen and experienced 
   attendants whose duty is (a) to exhaust him sexually by every known means (b) 
   to rouse him sexually by every known means. Every device and artifice of the 
   courtesan is to be employed, and every stimulant known to the physician. Nor 
   should the attendants reck of danger, but hunt down ruthlessly their appointed 
   prey.</p>
 <p>Finally the Candidate will into a sleep of utter exhaustion, resembling coma, 
   and it is now that delicacy and skill must be exquisite. Let him be roused from 
   this sleep by stimulation of a definitely and exclusively sexual type. Yet if 
   convenient, music wisely regulated will assist.</p>
 <p>The attendants will watch with assiduity for signs of waking; and the moment 
   these occur, all stimulation must cease instantly, and the Candidate be allowed 
   to fall again into sleep; but no sooner has this happened than the former practice 
   is resumed. This alteration is to continue indefinitely until the Candidate 
   is in a state which is neither sleep nor waking, and in which his Spirit, set 
   free by perfect exhaustion of the body, and yet prevented from entering the 
   City of Sleep, communes with the Most High and the Most Holy Lord God of its 
   being, maker of heaven and earth.</p>
 <p>The Ordeal terminates by failure---the occurence of sleep invincible--- or 
   by success, in which ultimate waking is followed by a final performance of the 
   sexual act. The Initiate may then be allowed to sleep, or the practice may be 
   renewed and persisted in until death ends all. The most favourable death is 
   that occurring during the orgasm, and is called Mors Justi.</p>
 <p>As it is written: Let me die the death of the Righteous, and let my last end 
   be like his!</p>
