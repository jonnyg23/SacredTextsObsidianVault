 <p></p><h3 align="center">PŒMANDRES, THE SHEPHERD OF MEN</h3>
 <p align="center"><small>(Text: R. 328-338; P. 1-18; Pat. 5b-8.) <a name="fr_0"></a><a href="#fn_0"><font size="1">1</font></a></small></p>
 <p>1. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">It</span> chanced once on a time my mind was meditating on the things that are, <a name="fr_1"></a><a href="#fn_1"><font size="1">2</font></a> my thought was raised to a great height, the senses of my body being held back—just as men are who are weighed down with sleep after a fill of food, or from fatigue of body.</p>
 <p>Methought a Being more than vast, in size beyond all bounds, called out my name and saith: What wouldst thou hear and see, and what hast thou in mind to learn and know?</p>
 <p>2. And I do say: Who art thou?</p>
 <p>He saith: I am Man-Shepherd, <a name="fr_2"></a><a href="#fn_2"><font size="1">3</font></a> Mind of all-</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_4"><font size="1" color="green">p. 4</font></a></p>
 <p>masterhood <a name="fr_3"></a><a href="#fn_3"><font size="1">1</font></a>; I know what thou desirest and Im with thee everywhere.</p>
 <p>3. [And] I reply: I long to learn the things that are, and comprehend their nature, and know God. This is, I said, what I desire to hear.</p>
 <p>He answered back to me: Hold in thy mind all thou wouldst know, and I will teach thee.</p>
 <p>4. Een with these words His aspect changed, <a name="fr_4"></a><a href="#fn_4"><font size="1">2</font></a> and straightway, in the twinkling of an eye, all things were opened to me, and I see a Vision limitless, all things turned into Light,—sweet, joyous [Light]. And I became transported as I gazed.</p>
 <p>But in a little while Darkness came settling down on part [of it], awesome and gloomy, coiling in sinuous folds, <a name="fr_5"></a><a href="#fn_5"><font size="1">3</font></a> so that methought it like unto a snake. <a name="fr_6"></a><a href="#fn_6"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>
 <p>And then the Darkness changed into some sort of a Moist Nature, tossed about beyond all power of words, belching out smoke as from a</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_5"><font size="1" color="green">p. 5</font></a></p>
 <p>fire, and groaning forth a wailing sound that beggars all description.</p>
 <p>[And] after that an outcry inarticulate came forth from it, as though it were a Voice of Fire.</p>
 <p>5. [Thereon] out of the Light . . . <a name="fr_7"></a><a href="#fn_7"><font size="1">1</font></a> a Holy Word (<i>Logos</i>) <a name="fr_8"></a><a href="#fn_8"><font size="1">2</font></a> descended on that Nature. And upwards to the height from the Moist Nature leaped forth pure Fire; light was it, swift and active too.</p>
 <p>The Air, too, being light, followed after the Fire; from out the Earth-and-Water rising up to Fire so that it seemed to hang therefrom.</p>
 <p>But Earth-and-Water stayed so mingled each with other, that Earth from Water no one could discern. <a name="fr_9"></a><a href="#fn_9"><font size="1">3</font></a> Yet were they moved to hear by reason of the Spirit-Word (<i>Logos</i>) pervading them.</p>
 <p>6. Then saith to me Man-Shepherd: Didst understand this Vision what it means?</p>
 <p>Nay; that <i>shall</i> I know, I said.</p>
 <p>That Light, He said, am I, thy God, Mind, prior to Moist Nature which appeared from Darkness; the Light-Word (<i>Logos</i>) [that appeared] from Mind is Son of God.</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_6"><font size="1" color="green">p. 6</font></a></p>
 <p>What then?—say I.</p>
 <p>Know that what sees in thee <a name="fr_10"></a><a href="#fn_10"><font size="1">1</font></a> and hears is the Lords Word (<i>Logos</i>); but Mind is Father-God. Not separate are they the one from other; just in their union [rather] is it Life consists.</p>
 <p>Thanks be to Thee, I said.</p>
 <p>So, understand the Light [He answered], and make friends with it.</p>
 <p>7. And speaking thus He gazed for long into my eyes, <a name="fr_11"></a><a href="#fn_11"><font size="1">2</font></a> so that I trembled at the look of Him.</p>
 <p>But when He raised His head, I see in Mind the Light, [but] now in Powers no man could number, and Cosmos <a name="fr_12"></a><a href="#fn_12"><font size="1">3</font></a> grown beyond all bounds, and that the Fire was compassed round about by a most mighty Power, and [now] subdued had come unto a stand.</p>
 <p>And when I saw these things I understood by reason of Man-Shepherds Word (<i>Logos</i>).</p>
 <p>8. But as I was in great astonishment, He saith to me again: Thou didst behold in Mind the Archetypal Form whose being is before beginning without end. Thus spake to me Man-Shepherd.</p>
 <p>And I say: Whence then have Natures elements their being?</p>
 <p>To this He answer gives: From Will of God.</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_7"><font size="1" color="green">p. 7</font></a></p>
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> [Nature <a name="fr_13"></a><a href="#fn_13"><font size="1">1</font></a>] received the Word (<i>Logos</i>), and gazing on the Cosmos Beautiful <a name="fr_14"></a><a href="#fn_14"><font size="1">2</font></a> did copy it, making herself into a cosmos, by means of her own elements and by the births of souls.</p>
 <p align="center"></p><hr align="CENTER" size="1" width="25%" noshade> <p>9. And God-the-Mind, being male and female both, as Light and Life subsisting, brought forth another Mind to give things form, who, God as he was of Fire and Spirit, <a name="fr_15"></a><a href="#fn_15"><font size="1">3</font></a> formed Seven Rulers who enclose the cosmos that the sense perceives. <a name="fr_16"></a><a href="#fn_16"><font size="1">4</font></a> Men call their ruling Fate. <a name="fr_17"></a><a href="#fn_17"><font size="1">5</font></a></p>
 <p>10. Straightway from out the downward elements Gods Reason (<i>Logos</i>) <a name="fr_18"></a><a href="#fn_18"><font size="1">6</font></a> leaped up to Natures pure formation, and was at-oned with the Formative Mind; for it was co-essential with it. <a name="fr_19"></a><a href="#fn_19"><font size="1">7</font></a> And Natures downward elements were thus left reason-less, so as to be pure matter.</p>
 <p>11. Then the Formative Mind ([at-oned] with Reason), he who surrounds the spheres and spins them with his whirl, set turning his formations, and let them turn from a beginning boundless unto an endless end. For that the circulation</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_8"><font size="1" color="green">p. 8</font></a></p>
 <p>of these [spheres] begins where it doth end, as Mind doth will.</p>
 <p>And from the downward elements Nature brought forth lives reason-less; for He did not extend the Reason (<i>Logos</i>) [to them]. The Air brought forth things winged; the Water things that swim, and Earth-and-Water one from another parted, as Mind willed. And from her bosom Earth produced what lives she had, four-footed things and reptiles, beasts wild and tame.</p>
 <p align="center"></p><hr align="CENTER" size="1" width="25%" noshade> <p>12. But All-Father Mind, being Life and Light, did bring forth Man <a name="fr_20"></a><a href="#fn_20"><font size="1">1</font></a> co-equal to Himself, with whom He fell in love, as being His own child; for he was beautiful beyond compare, the Image of his Sire. In very truth, God fell in love with His own Form <a name="fr_21"></a><a href="#fn_21"><font size="1">2</font></a>; and on him did bestow all of His own formations.</p>
 <p>13. And when he gazed upon what the Enformer had created in the Father, [Man] too wished to enform; and [so] assent was given him by the Father. <a name="fr_22"></a><a href="#fn_22"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>
 <p>Changing his state to the formative sphere, <a name="fr_23"></a><a href="#fn_23"><font size="1">4</font></a> in that he was to have his whole authority, <a name="fr_24"></a><a href="#fn_24"><font size="1">5</font></a> he</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_9"><font size="1" color="green">p. 9</font></a></p>
 <p>gazed upon his Brothers creatures. <a name="fr_25"></a><a href="#fn_25"><font size="1">1</font></a> They fell in love with him, and gave him each a share of his own ordering. <a name="fr_26"></a><a href="#fn_26"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>
 <p>And after that he had well-learned their essence and had become a sharer in their nature, he had a mind to break right through the Boundary of their spheres, and to subdue <a name="fr_27"></a><a href="#fn_27"><font size="1">3</font></a> the might of that which pressed upon the Fire. <a name="fr_28"></a><a href="#fn_28"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>
 <p>14. So he who hath the whole authority oer [all] the mortals in the cosmos and oer its lives irrational, bent his face downwards through <a name="fr_29"></a><a href="#fn_29"><font size="1">5</font></a> the Harmony, <a name="fr_30"></a><a href="#fn_30"><font size="1">6</font></a> breaking right through its strength, and showed to downward Nature Gods fair Form.</p>
 <p>And when she saw that Form of beauty which can never satiate, and him who [now] possessed within himself each single energy of [all seven] Rulers as well as Gods [own] Form, she smiled with love; for twas as though shed seen the image of Mans fairest form upon her Water, his shadow on her Earth.</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_10"><font size="1" color="green">p. 10</font></a></p>
 <p>He in his turn beholding the form like to himself, existing in her, in her Water, loved it and willed to live in it; and with the will came act, <a name="fr_31"></a><a href="#fn_31"><font size="1">1</font></a> and [so] he vivified the form devoid of reason.</p>
 <p>And Nature took the object of her love and wound herself completely round him, and they were intermingled, for they were lovers.</p>
 <p>15. And this is why beyond all creatures on the earth man is twofold; mortal because of body, but because of the essential Man immortal.</p>
 <p>Though deathless and possessed of sway oer all, yet doth he suffer as a mortal doth, subject to Fate.</p>
 <p>Thus though above the Harmony, within the Harmony he hath become a slave. Though male-female, <a name="fr_32"></a><a href="#fn_32"><font size="1">2</font></a> as from a Father male-female, and though hes sleepless from a sleepless [Sire], yet is he overcome [by sleep].</p>
 <p align="center"></p><hr align="CENTER" size="1" width="25%" noshade> <p>16. Thereon [I say: Teach on], <a name="fr_33"></a><a href="#fn_33"><font size="1">3</font></a> O Mind of me, for I myself as well <a name="fr_34"></a><a href="#fn_34"><font size="1">4</font></a> am amorous of the Word (<i>Logos</i>).</p>
 <p>The Shepherd said: This is the mystery kept hid until this day.</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_11"><font size="1" color="green">p. 11</font></a></p>
 <p>Nature embraced by Man brought forth a wonder, oh so wonderful. For as he had the nature of the Concord <a name="fr_35"></a><a href="#fn_35"><font size="1">1</font></a> of the Seven, who, as I said to thee, [were made] of Fire and Spirit <a name="fr_36"></a><a href="#fn_36"><font size="1">2</font></a>—Nature delayed not, but immediately brought forth seven “men,” in correspondence with the natures of the Seven, male-female and moving in the air. <a name="fr_37"></a><a href="#fn_37"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>
 <p>Thereon [I said]: O Shepherd, . . . <a name="fr_38"></a><a href="#fn_38"><font size="1">4</font></a>; for now Im filled with great desire and long to hear; do not run off. <a name="fr_39"></a><a href="#fn_39"><font size="1">5</font></a></p>
 <p>The Shepherd said: Keep silence, for not as yet have I unrolled for thee the first discourse (<i>logos</i>).</p>
 <p>Lo! I am still, I said.</p>
 <p>17. In such wise then, as I have said, the generation of these seven came to pass. Earth was as woman, her Water filled with longing; ripeness she took from Fire, spirit from Æther. Nature thus brought forth frames to suit the form of Man.</p>
 <p>And Man from Life and Light changed into soul and mind,—from Life to soul, from Light to mind.</p>
 <p>And thus continued all the sense-worlds</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_12"><font size="1" color="green">p. 12</font></a></p>
 <p>parts <a name="fr_40"></a><a href="#fn_40"><font size="1">1</font></a> until the period of their end and new beginnings.</p>
 <p align="center"></p><hr align="CENTER" size="1" width="25%" noshade> <p>18. Now listen to the rest of the discourse (<i>logos</i>) which thou dost long to hear.</p>
 <p>The period being ended, the bond that bound them all was loosened by Gods Will. For all the animals being male-female, at the same time with man were loosed apart; some became partly male, some in like fashion [partly] female. And straightway God spake by His Holy Word (<i>Logos</i>):</p>
 <p>“Increase ye in increasing, and multiply in multitude, ye creatures and creations all; and man that hath Mind in him, let him learn to know that he himself is deathless, and that the cause of death is love, <a name="fr_41"></a><a href="#fn_41"><font size="1">2</font></a> though Love is all.” <a name="fr_42"></a><a href="#fn_42"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>
 <p>19. When He said this, His Forethought <a name="fr_43"></a><a href="#fn_43"><font size="1">4</font></a> did by means of Fate and Harmony effect their couplings and their generations founded. And so all things were multiplied according to their kind.</p>
 <p>And he who thus hath learned to know himself, hath reached that Good which doth transcend abundance; but he who through a love that leads astray, expends his love upon his body,—</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_13"><font size="1" color="green">p. 13</font></a></p>
 <p>he stays in Darkness wandering, <a name="fr_44"></a><a href="#fn_44"><font size="1">1</font></a> and suffering through his senses things of Death.</p>
 <p>20. What is the so great fault, said I, the ignorant commit, that they should be deprived of deathlessness?</p>
 <p>Thou seemst, he said, O thou, not to have given heed to what thou heardest. Did not I bid thee <i>think?</i></p>
 <p>Yea do I think, and I remember, and therefore give Thee thanks.</p>
 <p>If thou didst think [thereon], [said He], tell me: Why do they merit death who are in Death?</p>
 <p>It is because the gloomy Darkness is the root and base of the material frame; from it <a name="fr_45"></a><a href="#fn_45"><font size="1">2</font></a> came the Moist Nature; from this <a name="fr_46"></a><a href="#fn_46"><font size="1">3</font></a> the body in the sense-world was composed; and from this [body] Death doth the Water drain.</p>
 <p>21. Right was thy thought, O thou! But how doth “he who knows himself, go unto Him,” as Gods Word (<i>Logos</i>) hath declared?</p>
 <p>And I reply: the Father of the universals doth consist of Light and Life, and from Him Man was born.</p>
 <p>Thou sayest well, [thus] speaking. Light and Life is Father-God, and from Him Man was born.</p>
 <p>If then thou learnest that thou <i>art</i> thyself of</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_14"><font size="1" color="green">p. 14</font></a></p>
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Life and Light, and that thou [only] <i>happenst</i> to be out of them, thou shalt return again to Life. Thus did Man-Shepherd speak.</p>
 <p>But tell me further, Mind of me, I cried, <i>how</i> shall <i>I</i> come to Life again . . . . for God doth say: “The man who hath Mind in him, let him learn to know that he himself [is deathless].”</p>
 <p>22. Have not all men then Mind?</p>
 <p>Thou sayest well, O thou, thus speaking. I, Mind, myself am present with holy men and good, the pure and merciful, men who live piously.</p>
 <p>[To such] my presence doth become an aid, and straightway they gain gnosis of all things, and win the Fathers love by their pure lives, and give Him thanks, invoking on Him blessings, and chanting hymns, intent on Him with ardent love.</p>
 <p>And ere they give the body up unto its proper death, they turn them with disgust from its sensations, from knowledge of what things they operate. <a name="fr_47"></a><a href="#fn_47"><font size="1">1</font></a> Nay, it is I, the Mind, that will not let the operations which befall the body, work to their [natural] end. For being door-keeper Ill close up [all] the entrances, and cut the mental actions off which base and evil energies induce.</p>
 <p>23. But to the Mind-less ones, the wicked and depraved, the envious and covetous, and those who murder do and love impiety, I am far off,</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_15"><font size="1" color="green">p. 15</font></a></p>
 <p>yielding my place to the Avenging Daimon, who sharpening the fire, tormenteth him and addeth fire to fire upon him, and rusheth on him through his senses, thus rendering him the readier for transgressions of the law, so that he meets with greater torment; nor doth he ever cease to have desire for appetites inordinate, insatiately striving in the dark. <a name="fr_48"></a><a href="#fn_48"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>
 <p>24. Well hast thou taught me all, as I desired, O Mind. And now, pray, tell me further of the nature of the Way Above as now it is [for me]. <a name="fr_49"></a><a href="#fn_49"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>
 <p>To this Man-Shepherd said: When thy material body is to be dissolved, first thou surrenderest the body by itself unto the work of change, and thus the form thou hadst doth vanish, and thou surrenderest thy way of life, <a name="fr_50"></a><a href="#fn_50"><font size="1">3</font></a> void of its energy, unto the Daimon. <a name="fr_51"></a><a href="#fn_51"><font size="1">4</font></a> The bodys senses next pass back into their sources, becoming separate, and resurrect as energies; and passion and desire <a name="fr_52"></a><a href="#fn_52"><font size="1">5</font></a> withdraw unto that nature which is void of reason.</p>
 <p>25. And thus it is that man doth speed his way thereafter upwards through the Harmony.</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_16"><font size="1" color="green">p. 16</font></a></p>
 <p>To the first zone he gives the Energy of Growth and Waning; unto the second [zone], Device of Evils [now] de-energized <a name="fr_53"></a><a href="#fn_53"><font size="1">1</font></a>; unto the third, the Guile of the Desires de-energized; unto the fourth, his Domineering Arrogance, [also] de-energized; unto the fifth, unholy Daring and the Rashness of Audacity, de-energized; unto the sixth, Striving for Wealth by evil means, deprived of its aggrandisement; and to the seventh zone, Ensnaring Falsehood, de-energized. <a name="fr_54"></a><a href="#fn_54"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>
 <p>26. And then, with all the energizings of the Harmony stript from him, clothed in his proper Power, he cometh to that Nature which belongs unto the Eighth, <a name="fr_55"></a><a href="#fn_55"><font size="1">3</font></a> and there with those-that-are hymneth the Father.</p>
 <p>They who are there welcome his coming there with joy; and he, made like to them that sojourn there, doth further hear the Powers who are above the Nature that belongs unto the Eighth, singing their songs of praise to God in language of their own.</p>
 <p>And then they, in a band, <a name="fr_56"></a><a href="#fn_56"><font size="1">4</font></a> go to the Father home; of their own selves they make surrender of themselves to Powers, and [thus] becoming Powers they are in God. This the good end for</p>

 <p>those who have gained Gnosis—to be made one with God.</p>
 <p>Why shouldst thou then delay? Must it not be, since thou hast all received, that thou shouldst to the worthy point the way, in order that through thee the race of mortal kind may by [thy] God be saved?</p>
 <p>27. This when Hed said, Man-Shepherd mingled with the Powers. <a name="fr_57"></a><a href="#fn_57"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>
 <p align="center"></p><hr align="CENTER" size="1" width="25%" noshade> <p>But I, with thanks and blessings unto the Father of the universal [Powers], was freed, full of the power He had poured into me, and full of what Hed taught me of the nature of the All and of the loftiest Vision.</p>
 <p>And I began to preach to men the Beauty of Devotion and of Gnosis:</p>
 <p>O ye people, earth-born folk, ye who have given yourselves to drunkenness and sleep and ignorance of God, be sober now, cease from your surfeit, cease to be glamoured by irrational sleep <a name="fr_58"></a><a href="#fn_58"><font size="1">2</font></a>!</p>
 <p>28. And when they heard, they came with one accord. Whereon I say:</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_18"><font size="1" color="green">p. 18</font></a></p>
 <p>Ye earth-born folk, why have ye given up yourselves to Death, while yet ye have the power of sharing Deathlessness? Repent, O ye, who walk with Error arm in arm and make of Ignorance the sharer of your board; get ye from out the light of Darkness, and take your part in Deathlessness, forsake Destruction!</p>
 <p>29. And some of them with jests upon their lips <a name="fr_59"></a><a href="#fn_59"><font size="1">1</font></a> departed [from me], abandoning themselves unto the Way of Death; others entreated to be taught, casting themselves before my feet.</p>
 <p>But I made them arise, and I became a leader of the Race <a name="fr_60"></a><a href="#fn_60"><font size="1">2</font></a> towards home, teaching the words (<i>logoi</i>), how and in what way they shall be saved. I sowed in them the words (<i>logoi</i>) of wisdom <a name="fr_61"></a><a href="#fn_61"><font size="1">3</font></a>; of Deathless Water were they given to drink. <a name="fr_62"></a><a href="#fn_62"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>
 <p>And when even was come and all suns beams began to set, I bade them all give thanks to God. And when they had brought to an end the giving of their thanks, each man returned to his own resting place.</p>
 <p align="center"></p><hr align="CENTER" size="1" width="25%" noshade> <p>30. But I recorded in my heart Man-Shepherds benefaction, and with my every hope fulfilled more than rejoiced. For bodys sleep became</p>

 <p>the souls awakening, <a name="fr_63"></a><a href="#fn_63"><font size="1">1</font></a> and closing of the eyes—true vision, pregnant with Good my silence, and the utterance of my word (<i>logos</i>) begetting of good things.</p>
 <p>All this befell me from my Mind, that is Man-Shepherd, Word (<i>Logos</i>) of all masterhood, <a name="fr_64"></a><a href="#fn_64"><font size="1">2</font></a> by whom being God-inspired I came unto the Plain of Truth. <a name="fr_65"></a><a href="#fn_65"><font size="1">3</font></a> Wherefore with all my soul and strength thanksgiving <a name="fr_66"></a><a href="#fn_66"><font size="1">4</font></a> give I unto Father-God.</p>

 <p>Holy art Thou, O God, whose Will perfects itself by means of its own Powers.</p>
 <p>Holy art Thou, O God, who willeth to be known and art known by Thine own.</p>
 <p>Holy art Thou, who didst by Word (<i>Logos</i>) make to consist the things that are.</p>
 <p>Holy art Thou, of whom All-nature hath been made an Image.</p>
 <p>Holy art Thou, whose Form Nature hath never made.</p>

 <p>Accept my reasons <a name="fr_67"></a><a href="#fn_67"><font size="1">1</font></a> offerings pure, from soul and heart for aye stretched up to Thee, O Thou unutterable, unspeakable, Whose Name naught but the Silence can express.</p>

Give ear to me who pray that I may neer of Gnosis fail, [Gnosis] which is our common Beings nature <a name="fr_68"></a><a href="#fn_68"><font size="1">2</font></a>; and fill me with Thy Power, and with this Grace [of Thine], that I may give the Light to those in ignorance of the Race, my Brethren, and Thy Sons.</p>
 <p>For this cause I believe, and I bear witness; I go to Life and Light. Blessed art Thou, O Father. Thy Man <a name="fr_69"></a><a href="#fn_69"><font size="1">3</font></a> would holy be as Thou art holy, een as Thou gavest him Thy full authority <a name="fr_70"></a><a href="#fn_70"><font size="1">4</font></a> [to be].</p>

 <p><a name="fn_3"></a><a href="th202.htm#fr_3">4:1</a> ὁ τῆς αὐθεντίας νοῦς. The αὐθεντία was the <i>summa potestas</i> of all things; see R. 8, n. 1; and § 30 below. <i>Cf.</i> also <i>C. H.</i>, xiii. (xiv.) 15.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_4"></a><a href="th202.htm#fr_4">4:2</a> ἠλλάγη τῇ ἰδέᾳ.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_5"></a><a href="th202.htm#fr_5">4:3</a> σκολιῶς ἐσπειραμένον. The sense is by no means certain. Ménard translates “<i>de forme sinueuse</i>”; Everard, “coming down obliquely”; Chambers, “sinuously terminated.” But <i>cf.</i> in the Sethian system “the sinuous Water—that is, Darkness (see Hipp., <i>Philos.</i>, v. 19).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_6"></a><a href="th202.htm#fr_6">4:4</a> <i>Cf.</i> Hipp., <i>Philos.</i>, v. 9 (S. 170, 71): “They say the Serpent is the Moist Essence.”</p>
 <p><a name="fn_7"></a><a href="th202.htm#fr_7">5:1</a> A lacuna of six letters in the text.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_8"></a><a href="th202.htm#fr_8">5:2</a> The idea of the Logos was the central concept of Hellenistic theology; it was thus a word of many meanings, signifying chiefly Reason and Word, but also much else. I have accordingly throughout added the term <i>Logos</i> after the English equivalent most suitable to the context.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_9"></a><a href="th202.htm#fr_9">5:3</a> <i>Cf.</i> <i>Il.</i>, vii. 99, as quoted by Apion in the chapter “Concerning the Æon” as Comment, on <i>C. H.</i>, xi. (xii.).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_12"></a><a href="th202.htm#fr_12">6:3</a> κόσμον. The word <i>kosmos</i> (world-order) means either “order” or “world”; and in the original there is frequently a play upon the two meanings, as in the case of <i>logos.</i></p>

 <p><a name="fn_14"></a><a href="th202.htm#fr_14">7:2</a> That is, the ideal world-order in the realms of reality.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_15"></a><a href="th202.htm#fr_15">7:3</a> Presumably the Pure Air of § 3.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_16"></a><a href="th202.htm#fr_16">7:4</a> τὸν αἰσθητὸν κόσμον. The sensible or manifested world, our present universe, as distinguished from the ideal eternal universe, the type of all universes.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_19"></a><a href="th202.htm#fr_19">7:7</a> ὁμοούσιος, usually translated “consubstantial”; but οὐσία is “essence” and “being” rather than “substance.”</p>

 <p><a name="fn_27"></a><a href="th202.htm#fr_27">9:3</a> Or “wear down” (καταπονῆσαι). The reading κατανοῆσαι, however, may be more correct; “he had a mind to come to knowledge of” this Boundary or Ring Pass not. See R. 49, n. 1.</p>
