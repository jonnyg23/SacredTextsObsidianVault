 <p></p><h4 align="center">XXXIII</h4>
 <p>1. [XII. M.] Now on the subject of a “Void,” <a name="fr_907"></a><a href="#fn_906"><font size="1">1</font></a>—which seems to almost all a thing of vast importance,—I hold the following view.</p>
 <p>Naught is, naught could have been, naught ever will be void.</p>
 <p>For all the members of the Cosmos are completely full; so that Cosmos itself is full and [quite] complete with bodies, diverse in quality and form, possessing each its proper kind and size.</p>
 <p>And of these bodies—ones greater than another, or anothers less than is another, by difference of strength and size.</p>
 <p>Of course, the stronger of them are more easily perceived, just as the larger [are]. The lesser ones, however, or the more minute, can scarcely be perceived, or not at all—those which we know are things [at all] by sense of touch alone.</p>
 <p>Whence many come to think they are not bodies, and that there are void spaces,—which is impossible.</p>
 <p>2. So also [for the Space] which is called</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_375"><font size="1" color="green">p. 375</font></a></p>
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Extra-cosmic,—if there be any (which I do not believe),—[then] is it filled by Him with things Intelligible, that is things of like nature with His own Divinity; just as this Cosmos which is called the Sensible, is fully filled with bodies and with animals, consonant with its proper nature and its quality;—[bodies] the proper shape of which we do not all behold, but [see] some large beyond their proper measure, some very small; either because of the great space which lies between [them and ourselves], or else because our sight is dull; so that they seem to us to be minute, or by the multitude are thought not to exist at all, because of their too great tenuity.</p>
 <p>I mean the daimones, who, I believe, have their abode with us, and heroes, who abide between the purest part of air above us and the earth,—where it is ever cloudless, and no [movement from the] motion of a single star [disturbs the peace].</p>
 <p>3. Because of this, Asclepius, thou shalt call nothing void; unless thou wilt declare of what thats void, which thou dost say is void;—for instance, void of fire, of water, or things like to these.</p>
 <p>For if it should fall out, that it should seem that anything is able to be void of things like these,—though that which seemeth void be little</p>
 <p><a name="page_376"><font size="1" color="green">p. 376</font></a></p>
 <p>or be big, it still cannot be void of spirit and of air.</p>
 <p></p><h4 align="center">XXXIV</h4>
 <p>1. In like way must we also talk concerning “Space,” <a name="fr_908"></a><a href="#fn_907"><font size="1">1</font></a>—a term which by itself is void of “sense.” <a name="fr_909"></a><a href="#fn_908"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>
 <p>For Space seems what it is from that of which it is [the space]. For if the qualifying <a name="fr_910"></a><a href="#fn_909"><font size="1">3</font></a> word is cut away, the sense is maimed.</p>
 <p>Wherefore we shall [more] rightly say the space of water, space of fire, or [space] of things like these.</p>
 <p>For as it is impossible that aught be void; so is Space also in itself not possible to be distinguished what it is.</p>
 <p>For if you postulate a space without that [thing] of which it is [the space], it will appear to be void space,—which I do not believe exists in Cosmos.</p>
 <p>2. If nothing, then, is void, so also Space by its own self does not show what it is unless you add to it lengths, breadths [and depths],—just as you add the proper marks <a name="fr_911"></a><a href="#fn_910"><font size="1">4</font></a> unto mens bodies.</p>
 <p>These things, then, being thus, Asclepius, and ye who are with [him],—know the Intelligible</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_377"><font size="1" color="green">p. 377</font></a></p>
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Cosmos (that is, [the one] which is discerned by contemplation of the mind alone) is bodiless; nor can aught corporal be mingled with its nature,—[by corporal I mean] what can be known by quality, by quantity, and numbers. For there is nothing of <i>this</i> kind in that.</p>
 <p>3. This Cosmos, then, which is called Sensible, is the receptacle of all things sensible,—of species, qualities, or bodies.</p>
 <p>But not a single one of these can quicken without God. For God is all, and by Him [are] all things, and all [are] of His Will.</p>
 <p>For that He is all Goodness, Fitness, Wisdom, unchangeable,—that can be sensed and understood by His own self alone.</p>
 <p>Without Him naught hath been, nor is, nor will be.</p>
 <p>4. For all things are from Him, in Him, and through Him,—both multitudinous qualities, and mighty quantities, and magnitudes exceeding every means of measurement, and species of all forms;—which things, if thou shouldst understand, Asclepius, thou wilt give thanks to God.</p>
 <p>And if thou shouldst observe it <a name="fr_912"></a><a href="#fn_911"><font size="1">1</font></a> as a whole, thou wilt be taught, by means of the True Reason, that Cosmos in itself is knowable to sense, <a name="fr_913"></a><a href="#fn_912"><font size="1">2</font></a> and that all things in it are wrapped</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_378"><font size="1" color="green">p. 378</font></a></p>
 <p>as in a vesture by that Higher Cosmos <a name="fr_914"></a><a href="#fn_913"><font size="1">1</font></a> [spoken of above].</p>
 <p></p><h4 align="center">XXXV</h4>
 <p>1. Now every single class of living thing, <a name="fr_915"></a><a href="#fn_914"><font size="1">2</font></a> Asclepius, of whatsoever kind, or it be mortal or be rational, whether it be endowed with soul, or be without one, just as each has its class, <a name="fr_916"></a><a href="#fn_915"><font size="1">3</font></a> so does each several [class] have images of its own class.</p>
 <p>And though each separate class of animal has in it every form of its own class, still in the selfsame [kind of] form the units differ from each other.</p>
 <p>And so although the class of men is of one kind, so that a man can be distinguished by his [general] look, still individual men within the sameness of their [common] form do differ from each other.</p>
 <p>2. For the idea <a name="fr_917"></a><a href="#fn_916"><font size="1">4</font></a> which is divine, is bodiless, and is whatever is grasped by the mind.</p>
 <p>So that although these two, <a name="fr_918"></a><a href="#fn_917"><font size="1">5</font></a> from which the general form and body are derived, are bodiless, it is impossible that any single form should be produced exactly like another,—because the</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_379"><font size="1" color="green">p. 379</font></a></p>
 <p>moments of the hours and points of inclination [when theyre born] are different.</p>
 <p>But they are changed as many times as there are moments in the hour of that revolving Circle in which abides that God whom we have called All-formed. <a name="fr_919"></a><a href="#fn_918"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>
 <p>3. The species, <a name="fr_920"></a><a href="#fn_919"><font size="1">2</font></a> then, persists, as frequently producing from itself as many images, and as diverse, as there are moments in the Cosmic Revolution, <a name="fr_921"></a><a href="#fn_920"><font size="1">3</font></a>—a Cosmos which doth [ever] change in revolution. But the idea <a name="fr_922"></a><a href="#fn_921"><font size="1">4</font></a> [itself] is neither changed nor turned.</p>
 <p>So are the forms of every single genus permanent, [and yet] dissimilar in the same [general] form.</p>
 <p></p><h4 align="center">XXXVI</h4>
 <p>1. <i>Asc.</i> And does the Cosmos have a species, O Thrice-greatest one?</p>
 <p align="center"></p><hr align="CENTER" size="1" width="25%" noshade> <p><i>Tris.</i> Dost not thou see, Asclepius, that all has been explained to thee as though to one asleep?</p>
 <p>For what is Cosmos, or of what doth it consist, if not of all things born?</p>
 <p>This, <a name="fr_923"></a><a href="#fn_922"><font size="1">5</font></a> then, you may assert of heaven, and</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_380"><font size="1" color="green">p. 380</font></a></p>
 <p>earth, and elements. For though the other things possess more frequent change of species, [still even] heaven, [by its] becoming moist, or dry, or cold, or hot, or clear, or dull, [all] in one kind <a name="fr_924"></a><a href="#fn_923"><font size="1">1</font></a> of heaven,—these [too] are frequent changes into species. <a name="fr_925"></a><a href="#fn_924"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>
 <p>2. Earth hath, moreover, always many changes in <i>its</i> species;—both when she brings forth fruits, and when she also nourishes her bringings-forth with the return of all the fruits; the diverse qualities and quantities of air, its stoppings and its flowings <a name="fr_926"></a><a href="#fn_925"><font size="1">3</font></a>; and before all the qualities of trees, of flowers, and berries, of scents, of savours—species.</p>
 <p>Fire [also] brings about most numerous conversions, and divine. For these are all-formed images of Sun and Moon <a name="fr_927"></a><a href="#fn_926"><font size="1">4</font></a>; theyre, as it were, like our own mirrors, which with their emulous resplendence give us back the likenesses of our own images.</p>
