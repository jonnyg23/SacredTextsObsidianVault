 <p align="center"><small>(Text: P. 54, 55; Pat. 18a.)</small></p>
 <p>1. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Whither</span> stumble ye, sots, who have sopped up the wine of ignorance unmixed, and can so far not carry it that ye already even spew it forth?</p>
 <p>Stay ye, be sober, gaze upwards with the [true] eyes of the heart! And if ye cannot all, yet ye at least who can!</p>
 <p>For that the ill of ignorance doth pour oer all the earth and overwhelm the soul thats battened down within the body, preventing it from fetching port within Salvations harbours.</p>
 <p>2. Be then not carried off by the fierce flood, but using the shore-current, <a name="fr_208"></a><a href="#fn_208"><font size="1">1</font></a> ye who can, make for Salvations port, and, harbouring there, seek ye for one to take you by the hand and lead you <a name="fr_209"></a><a href="#fn_209"><font size="1">2</font></a> unto Gnosis gates.</p>

 <p>Where shines clear Light, of every darkness clean; where not a single soul is drunk, but sober all they gaze with their hearts eyes on Him who willeth to be seen.</p>
 <p>No ear can hear Him, nor can eye see Him, nor tongue speak of Him, but [only] mind and heart.</p>
 <p>But first thou must tear off from thee the cloak which thou dost wear,—the web of ignorance, the ground of bad, corruptions chain, the carapace of darkness, the living death, sensations corpse, the tomb thou carriest with thee, the robber in thy house, who through the things he loveth, hateth thee, and through the things he hateth, bears thee malice.</p>
 <p>3. Such is the hateful cloak thou wearest,—that throttles thee [and holds thee] down to it, in order that thou mayst not gaze above, and, having seen the Beauty of the Truth, and Good that dwells therein, detest the bad of it; having found out the plot that it hath schemed against thee, by making void of sense those seeming things which men think senses.</p>
 <p>For that it hath with mass of matter blocked them up and crammed them full of loathsome lust, so that thou mayst not hear about the things that thou shouldst hear, nor see the things that thou shouldst see.</p>
