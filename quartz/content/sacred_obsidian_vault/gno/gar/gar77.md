 <p>1. Serapis, viewed as the Sun-god, enthroned; at his feet, the triple-headed monster described by Macrobius. Before him stands Isis, or Mother Earth, holding a bunch of wheat-ears and poppy-heads, to mark her character. The legend is the invocation "Immaculate is Our Lady, Isis!" A fine specimen of Alexandrian art, in a beautiful sard. (New York.)</p>  
 <p>2. Venus, arranging her hair at a mirror, held up to her by a Cupid; two Loves, hovering in the air, hold a myrtle-crown over her head. The inscription "The Manifestation of Aroriph," occurs in a similar connection upon a gem in the Paris Cabinet. It is hard to determine whether she be the "nuda veritas," whose Kabbalistic revelation to Marcus is given in my text; or merely a talisman for engendering love towards the wearer; the material, magnetic hæmatite, supports the latter acceptation. The reverse exhibits Horus, seated on the lotus, planted upon the <i>baris</i>, which is constructed out of long papyrus-stalks lashed together. He here takes the title of <i>Abraxas</i>, and is surrounded by adoring triplets of all the animals held sacred by the Egyptians. The symbol of the Sun is seen at his right.</p>  
 <p>3. Bust of Serapis, very curious for the prayer surrounding it, "Protect Jupiter!" a proof that Serapis is here regarded as the Supreme Being, and the ancient Jupiter reduced to the rank of an astral Power; as, indeed he was occasionally so understood in better times. Thus Persius: "Saturnumque gravem nostro <i>Iove</i> fregimus una." (v. 50.)</p>  
 <p>4. Isis, veiled, with the <i>tubulus</i> on her head, and leaning on a tall sceptre, in the pose of the Roman Juno; for whom she might be mistaken but for the invocation on the other side, "Baffle, Serapis, the Evil Eye!" which declares the object of this talisman.</p>

 <p>5. Serapis, enthroned, seen in front face. Inscribed "Hermes," followed by three letters, the initials of some then well-known address to that god. Or if merely a private signature (Martial mentions a physician of the name) the initials refer to his business. The God of the Shades was a very fit patron for a professional who had doubtless done his best to swell the ranks of his subjects. Red jasper. (New York.)</p>
