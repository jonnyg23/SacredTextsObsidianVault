 <p>OF the life of Heracleon, whom Clement of Alexandria (<i>Strom</i>., iv. 9) calls the "most esteemed of the <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">His Commentary on the Fourth Gospel.</font></span> school of Valentinus," we again know nothing except that he wrote certain Memoirs (ὑπομνήματα), containing a commentary on the fourth Gospel. The date of this commentary, the first on any book of the New Testament collection, is generally ascribed to the decade 170-180 <small>A.D.</small> The Gnostic Heracleon is thus the first commentator of canonical Christianity, and considerable fragments of his work have been preserved by Origen in his own Commentary on the so-called Johannine Gospel. These fragments were first collected by Grabe in his <i>Spicilegium</i>, reprinted by Massuet and Stieren in their editions of Irenæus, and by Hilgenfeld in his <i>Ketzergeschichte</i> (1884), and finally in 1891 re-edited from a new collation of all the eight known (only three having previously been collated) MSS. by Brooke in <i>Texts and Studies</i>, i. 4.</p>  
 <p>In these fragments Heracleon assumes the "Valentinian" system as a basis; but it is kept in the background, and his exegesis is often endorsed by Origen.</p>  
 <p>The Gnostics were still in the Christian ranks, they were still members of the General Christian body, and desired to remain members; but bigotry finally drove them out because they dared to say that the teaching of the Christ contained a wisdom</p>  
 <p><a name="page_392"><font size="1" color="green">p. 392</font></a></p>  
 <p>which transcended the comprehension of the majority.</p>  
 <p>The commentary of Heracleon, however, need not detain us, for it is, so to say, outside the circle of distinct Gnostic exegesis; it stands midway between it and General Christianity, and in almost the same position as the views of Clement and Origen.</p>
