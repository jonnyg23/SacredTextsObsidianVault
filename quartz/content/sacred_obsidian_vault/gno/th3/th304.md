 <p></p><h3 align="center">OF TRUTH</h3>
 <p><small>(Title from Patrizzi (p. 46b), preceded by: “Of Thrice-greatest Hermes to Tat.”</small></p>
 <p><small>Text: Stob., <i>Flor</i>., xi. 23, under heading: “Of Hermes from the [Sermons] to Tat”; G, i. 307-311; M. i. 248-251; H. iii. 436-441.</small></p>
 <p><small>Ménard, Livre IV., No. ix. of “Fragments from the Books of Hermes to his Son Tat,” pp. 251-255.)</small></p>
 <p>1. [<i>Her</i>.] Concerning Truth, O Tat, it is not possible that man should dare to speak, for mans an animal imperfect, composed out of imperfect members, his tabernacle <a name="fr_53"></a><a href="#fn_53"><font size="1">1</font></a> patched together from many bodies strange [to him].</p>
 <p>But what is possible and right, this do I say,—that Truth is [to be found] in the eternal bodies only, [those things] of which the bodies in themselves are true, <a name="fr_54"></a><a href="#fn_54"><font size="1">2</font></a>—fire very fire and nothing else, earth very earth and nothing else, air very air and nothing else, and water very water and naught else.</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_18"><font size="1" color="green">p. 18</font></a></p>
 <p>Our frames, however, are a compound of all these. For they have [in them] fire, and they have also earth, theyve water, too, and air; but they are neither fire, nor earth, nor water, nor air, <a name="fr_55"></a><a href="#fn_55"><font size="1">1</font></a> nor any [element thats] true.</p>
 <p>And if our composition has not had Truth for its beginning, how can it either see or speak the Truth?</p>
 <p>Nay, it can only have a notion of it,—[and that too] if God will.</p>
 <p>2. All things, accordingly, that are on earth, O Tat, are not the Truth; theyre copies [only] of the True.</p>
 <p>And these are not all things, but few [of them]; the rest consist of falsity and error, Tat, and shows of seeming like unto images.</p>
 <p>Whenever the appearance doth receive the influx from above, it turns into a copy of the Truth; without its <a name="fr_56"></a><a href="#fn_56"><font size="1">2</font></a> energizing from above, it is left false.</p>
 <p>Just as the portrait also indicates the body in the picture, but in itself is not a body, in spite of the appearance of the thing thats seen.</p>
 <p>Tis seen as having eyes; but it sees naught, hears naught at all.</p>
 <p>The picture, too, has all the other things, but they are false, tricking the sight of the beholders,</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_19"><font size="1" color="green">p. 19</font></a></p>
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> —these thinking that they see whats true, while what they see is really false.</p>
 <p>All, then, who do not see whats false see truth.</p>
 <p>If, then, we thus do comprehend, or see, each one of these <a name="fr_57"></a><a href="#fn_57"><font size="1">1</font></a> just as it really is, we really comprehend and see.</p>
 <p>But if [we comprehend, or see, things] contrary to that which is, we shall not comprehend, nor shall we know aught true.</p>
 <p>3. [<i>Tat</i>.] There is, then, father, Truth een on the earth?</p>
 <p>[<i>Her.</i>] Not inconsiderably, O son, art thou at fault.</p>
 <p>Truth is in no wise, Tat, upon the earth, nor can it be.</p>
 <p>But some men can, [I say,] have an idea of it,—should God grant them the power of godly vision. <a name="fr_58"></a><a href="#fn_58"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>
 <p>Thus there is nothing true on earth,—[so much] I know and say. All are appearances and shows,—I know and speak true [things]. We ought not, surely, though, to call the knowing and the speaking of true things the Truth?</p>
 <p>4. [<i>Tat</i>.] Why, how on earth ought we to know and speak of things being true,—yet nothings true on earth?</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_20"><font size="1" color="green">p. 20</font></a></p>
 <p>[<i>Her</i>.] This [much] is true,—that we do not know aught thats true down here. <a name="fr_59"></a><a href="#fn_59"><font size="1">1</font></a> How could it be, O son?</p>
 <p>For Truth is the most perfect virtue, the very highest Good, by matter undisturbed, uncircumscribed by body,—naked, [and] evident, changeless, august, unalterable Good.</p>
 <p>But things down here, O son, thou seest what they are,—not able to receive this Good, corruptible, [and] passible, dissolvable, changeful, and ever altering, being born from one another.</p>
 <p>Things, then, that are not true even to their own selves, how can they [possibly] be true?</p>
 <p>For all that alters is untrue; it does not stay in what it is, but shows itself to us by changing into one another its appearances.</p>
 <p>5. [<i>Tat</i>.] And even man,—is he not true, O father?</p>
 <p>[<i>Her</i>.] As man,—he is not true, O son. For that the True is that which has its composition from itself alone, and in itself stays as it is.</p>
 <p>But man has been composed of many things, and does not stay in his own self.</p>
 <p>He changes and he alters, from age to age, from form to form, and that too, even while hes still in [one and] the [same] tent. <a name="fr_60"></a><a href="#fn_60"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>
 <p>Nay, many fail to recognize their children,</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_21"><font size="1" color="green">p. 21</font></a></p>
 <p>when a brief space of time comes in between; and so again of children with their parents.</p>
 <p>That, then, which changes so that its no longer recognized,—can that be true, O Tat?</p>
 <p>Is it not, rather, false, coming and going, <a name="fr_61"></a><a href="#fn_61"><font size="1">1</font></a> in the [all] varied shows of its [continual] changes?</p>
 <p>But do thou have it in thy mind that a true thing is that which stays and lasts for aye.</p>
 <p>But “man” is not for ever; wherefore it <a name="fr_62"></a><a href="#fn_62"><font size="1">2</font></a> is not true. “Mans” an appearance. And appearance is extreme untruth.</p>
 <p>6. [<i>Tat</i>.] But these external bodies, <a name="fr_63"></a><a href="#fn_63"><font size="1">3</font></a> father, too, in that they change, are they not true?</p>
 <p>[<i>Her.</i>] All that is subject unto genesis and change, is verily not true; but in as much as they are brought to being by the Forefather <a name="fr_64"></a><a href="#fn_64"><font size="1">4</font></a> [of them all], they have their matter true.</p>
 <p>But even they have something false in that they change; for naught that doth not stay with its own self is true.</p>
 <p>[<i>Tat</i>.] True, father [mine]! Is one to say, then, that the Sun alone,—in that in greater measure than the rest of them he doth not change but stayeth with himself,—is Truth?</p>
 <p>[<i>Her</i>.] [Nay, rather, but] because he, and</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_22"><font size="1" color="green">p. 22</font></a></p>
 <p>he only, hath entrusted unto him the making of all things in cosmos, <a name="fr_65"></a><a href="#fn_65"><font size="1">1</font></a> ruling all and making all;—to whom I reverence give, and worship pay unto his Truth, and recognise him as the Demiurge after the One and First.</p>
 <p>[<i>Tat</i>.] What then, O father, shouldst thou say is the first Truth?</p>
 <p>[<i>Her</i>.] The One and Only, Tat,—He who is not of matter, or in body, the colourless, the figureless, the changeless [One], He who doth alter not, who ever is.</p>
 <p>But the untrue, O son, doth perish. All things, however, on the earth that perish,—the Forethought of the True hath comprehended [them], and doth and will encompass [them].</p>
 <p>For birth without corruption <a name="fr_66"></a><a href="#fn_66"><font size="1">2</font></a> cannot be; corruption followeth on every birth, in order that it may be born again.</p>
 <p>For that things that are born, must of necessity be born from things that are destroyed <a name="fr_67"></a><a href="#fn_67"><font size="1">3</font></a>; and things that have been born, must of necessity be [once again] destroyed, in order that the genesis of things existent may not stop.</p>
 <p>First, [then], see that thou recognize him <a name="fr_68"></a><a href="#fn_68"><font size="1">4</font></a> as the Demiurge for birth-and-death <a name="fr_69"></a><a href="#fn_69"><font size="1">5</font></a> of [all] existent things.</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_23"><font size="1" color="green">p. 23</font></a></p>
 <p>8. Things that are born out of destruction, then, must of necessity be false,—in that they are becoming now these things, now those. For tis impossible they should <i>become</i> the same.</p>
 <p>But that which is not “same,”—how can it possibly be true?</p>
 <p>Such things we should, then, call appearances, [my] son; for instance, if we give the man his proper designation, [we ought to designate him] a mans <a name="fr_70"></a><a href="#fn_70"><font size="1">1</font></a> appearance;—[and so] the child a childs appearance, the youth a youths appearance, the man a mans appearance, the old man an appearance of the same.</p>
 <p>For man is not a man, nor child a child, nor youth a youth, nor grown up man a grown up man, nor aged man a [single] aged man.</p>
 <p>But as they change they are untrue,—both pre-existent things and things existent.</p>
 <p>But thus think of them, son,—as even these untruths being energies dependent from above from Truth itself.</p>
 <p>And this being so, I say untruth is Truths in-working. <a name="fr_71"></a><a href="#fn_71"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>
