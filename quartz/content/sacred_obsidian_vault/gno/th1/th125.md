 <h5 align="center">THE UNDER-MEANING A REFLEXION OF A CERTAIN REASON </h5>
 
 <p>XX. I. These are approximately the chief headings of their myth, after the most ill-omened have been removed,—such as, for instance, the one about the cutting up into pieces of Horus, and the beheading of Isis. </p>
 
 <p>2. That, however, if people suppose and say these things about that Blessed and Incorruptible Nature according to which especially the Divine conceives itself, as though they were actually enacted and really took place, “thou shouldst spit out and cleanse mouth,” according to Æschylus, <a name="fr_988"></a><a href="#fn_989"><font size="1">6</font></a> there is no need to tell thee; <a name="fr_989"></a><a href="#fn_990"><font size="1">7</font></a> for of thyself thou showest displeasure at those who hold illegitimate and barbarous notions about the Gods. </p>
