 <h5 align="center">OF THE GREEK DISCIPLES OF EGYPTIANS AND OF PYTHAGORAS AND HIS SYMBOLS </h5>
 
 <p>X. 1. And the most wise of the Greeks also are witnesses—Solon, Thales, Plato, Eudoxus, Pythagoras, and, as some say, Lycurgus as well—through coming to Egypt and associating with her priests. </p>
 
 <p>2. And so they say that Eudoxus was hearer of Chonouphis <a name="fr_859"></a><a href="#fn_860"><font size="1">3</font></a> of Memphis, and Solon of Sonchis of Saïs, and Pythagoras of Œnuphis of Heliopolis. </p>
 
 <p>3. And the last especially, as it appears, being contemplated and contemplating, <a name="fr_860"></a><a href="#fn_861"><font size="1">4</font></a> brought back to the </p>

 <p>memory of his men their <a name="fr_861"></a><a href="#fn_862"><font size="1">1</font></a> symbolic and mysterious [art], containing their dogmas in dark sayings. </p>
 
 <p>4. For most of the Pythagoric messages leave out nothing of what are called the hieroglyphic letters; for instance: “Eat not on what bears two”; <a name="fr_862"></a><a href="#fn_863"><font size="1">2</font></a> “Sit not down on measure”; <a name="fr_863"></a><a href="#fn_864"><font size="1">3</font></a> “Plant not phœnix”; <a name="fr_864"></a><a href="#fn_865"><font size="1">4</font></a> “Stir not fire with knife <a name="fr_865"></a><a href="#fn_866"><font size="1">5</font></a> in house.” </p>
 
 <p>5. And, for myself at least, I think that his mens calling the monad Apollo, <a name="fr_866"></a><a href="#fn_867"><font size="1">6</font></a> and the dyad Artemis, and the hebdomad Athena, and the first cube <a name="fr_867"></a><a href="#fn_868"><font size="1">7</font></a> Poseidon, also resembles those whose statues preside over the sacred places, and whose dramas are acted [there], yea and [the names] painted <a name="fr_868"></a><a href="#fn_869"><font size="1">8</font></a> [there as well]. </p>

 <p>6. For they write the King and Lord, Osiris, <a name="fr_869"></a><a href="#fn_870"><font size="1">1</font></a> with “eye” and “sceptre.” <a name="fr_870"></a><a href="#fn_871"><font size="1">2</font></a> But some interpret the name also as “many-eyed,” since in the Egyptian tongue <i>os</i> means “many,” and <i>iri</i> “eye.” </p>
 
 <p>7. And they write Heaven, as unageing through eternity, <a name="fr_871"></a><a href="#fn_872"><font size="1">3</font></a> with “heart,” [that is] spirit, <a name="fr_872"></a><a href="#fn_873"><font size="1">4</font></a> [rising] from “altar” <a name="fr_873"></a><a href="#fn_874"><font size="1">5</font></a> underneath. </p>
 
 <p>8. And at Thebes there used to be set up hand-less statues of judges, while the [statue] of the chief judge had its eyes tight shut,—seeing that Justice neither gives nor takes gift, and is not worked on. </p>
 
 <p>9. And for the warriors, “scarab” was their seal-emblem;—for the scarab is not female, but all [scarabs] are male, <a name="fr_874"></a><a href="#fn_875"><font size="1">6</font></a> and they engender their seed into matter [or material] which they make into spheres, preparing a field not so much of nourishment <a name="fr_875"></a><a href="#fn_876"><font size="1">7</font></a> as of genesis. </p>

 <h3 align="CENTER">Footnotes</h3>
 <p><a name="fn_860"></a><a href="th122.htm#fr_859">274:3</a> That is, presumably, Knouph or Knef.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_861"></a><a href="th122.htm#fr_860">274:4</a> θαυμασθεὶς καὶ θαυμάσας, passive and active of the verb of θαῦμα, generally translated “wonder,” but meaning radically “look at with awe”; hence contemplate religiously (the art of θεωρία), and hence the Platonic (? Pythagorean) saying: “The beginning of philosophy is wonder.” Compare the variants of the new-found Jesus logos (“Let not him who seeks,” etc.), which preserve both θαμβηθεὶς and θαυμάσας.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_862"></a><a href="th122.htm#fr_861">275:1</a> That is, to the men of Greece the art of the Egyptians.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_863"></a><a href="th122.htm#fr_862">275:2</a> ἐπὶ δίφρον (= δι-φόρον)—variously translated “off a chair,” “in a chariot,” hence “on a journey.” “That which bears two” is that which either carries two or brings forth two; the logos is thus, perhaps, a warning against falling into duality of any kind, and hence an injunction to contemplate unity.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_864"></a><a href="th122.htm#fr_863">275:3</a> The χοῖνιξ was a dry measure, the standard of a mans (slaves) daily allowance of corn. Hence, perhaps, in one sense the symbol may mean: “Be not content with your daily bread only”; yet any meaning connected with “that which measures” would suit the interpretation, such as, “Best not on measure, but move in the unimmeasurable.”</p>
 <p><a name="fn_865"></a><a href="th122.htm#fr_864">275:4</a> φοῖνιξ means a “Phœnician” (as opposed to an Egyptian), a “date palm” (as opposed to a “pine”), and a “phœnix”; in colour this was “purple red,” “purple,” or “crimson.” The phœnix <i>proper</i> rose again from its ashes; <i>its</i> colour was golden. φυτύειν means “plant,” but also “engender,” “beget.”</p>
 <p><a name="fn_866"></a><a href="th122.htm#fr_865">275:5</a> μάχαιρα was, in Homeric times, the technical term for the sacred sacrificial knife—the knife that kills and divides the victims body, while the fire transmutes and consumes it. There may, perhaps, be some connection between the symbol and the gnomic couplet of Hesiod quoted above (iv. 3); it is, however, generally said to mean, “Do not provoke an angry man,” but this leaves out of consideration the concluding words “in house.”</p>
 <p><a name="fn_867"></a><a href="th122.htm#fr_866">275:6</a> <i>Cf.</i> lxxv. 14.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_868"></a><a href="th122.htm#fr_867">275:7</a> Presumably the ogdoad or eight.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_869"></a><a href="th122.htm#fr_868">275:8</a> Or “written” or “engraved.”</p>
 <p><a name="fn_870"></a><a href="th122.htm#fr_869">276:1</a> Eg. Ȧsȧr.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_871"></a><a href="th122.htm#fr_870">276:2</a> Generally a “throne” in the hieroglyphs. But for the numerous variants, see Budge, <i>Gods of the Egyptians,</i> ii. 113. <i>Cf.</i> li. 1 below.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_872"></a><a href="th122.htm#fr_871">276:3</a> ἀϊδιότητα—lit., form-(or idea-) less-ness; transcending all forms.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_873"></a><a href="th122.htm#fr_872">276:4</a> θυμὸν, one of the most primitive terms of Greek psychology—spirit or soul, or more generally life-principle.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_874"></a><a href="th122.htm#fr_873">276:5</a> ἐσχάρα, an altar for burnt offerings; here probably symbolising Earth as the syzygy of Heaven.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_875"></a><a href="th122.htm#fr_874">276:6</a> It is to be remembered that the “mark” of the warriors was their manliness (ix. 1).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_876"></a><a href="th122.htm#fr_875">276:7</a> Matter (ὕλη) being the Nurse, “according to Plato.” The legend was that the scarab beetle deposited its seed into dung which it first made into balls (lxxiv. 5).</p>
