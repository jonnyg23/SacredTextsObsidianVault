 <h4 align="center">THE MYTH OF MAN IN THE MYSTERIES </h4>
 <h5 align="center">THE GNOSTIC TRADITION </h5>
 
 <p>“<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">But</span> All-Father Mind, being Life and Light, did bring forth Man (Ἄνθρωπον) co-equal to Himself.” <a name="fr_300"></a><a href="#fn_300"><font size="1">1</font></a> </p>
 
 <p>So runs the opening paragraph of what we may call the soteriological part of the “Pœmandres” treatise of our Trismegistic literature. This Man or Anthrōpos is the Spiritual Prototype of humanity and of every individual man, and is a technical term found in a number of the early Christianised Gnostic systems. </p>
 
 <p>For instance, in a system some outlines of which are preserved in the polemical <i>Refutation</i> of Irenæus, <a name="fr_301"></a><a href="#fn_301"><font size="1">2</font></a> and which the Bishop of Lyons seems to associate with an Ophite tradition, while Theodoret <a name="fr_302"></a><a href="#fn_302"><font size="1">3</font></a> ascribes it to the Sethians, we are told that in the Unutterable Depth were two Great Lights,—the First Man, or Father, and His Son, the Second Man; and also the Holy Spirit, the First Woman, or Mother of all living. </p>
 
 <p>In this tradition, moreover, the Son of the Mother—the chief Formative Power of the seven Demiurgic Potencies of the sensible cosmos—is called Ialdabaōth (? the Child of the Egg), who boasts himself to be </p>
 
 <p>
 </p>
 
 <p>
 </p>
 
 <p>
 </p>
 
 <p><a name="page_140"><font size="1" color="green">p. 140</font></a></p>
 
 <p>supreme. But his mother, Wisdom, reproves his pride, saying unto him: “Lie not, Ialdabaōth, for above thee is the Father of All, First Man, and Man Son of Man.” <a name="fr_303"></a><a href="#fn_303"><font size="1">1</font></a> </p>
 
 <h5 align="center">THE “PHILOSOPHUMENA” OF HIPPOLYTUS </h5><p>But the main source of our information on this Anthrōpos tradition, in its Christianised Gnostic form, is to be found in Hippolytus <i>Philosophumena; or, Refutation of all Heresies.</i> </p>
 
 <p>In 1842, Minoïdes Mynas, a learned Greek, sent on a literary mission by the French Government, discovered in one of the monasteries on Mount Athos the only MS. (generally ascribed to the fourteenth century) which we possess of this extremely valuable work. It was originally in ten books, but, unfortunately, the first three and the beginning of the fourth are missing from our MS. The first book, however, was already known, though previously erroneously ascribed to Origen, and was accordingly prefixed to the text of the <i>editio princeps</i> of our work by Emmanuel Miller (Oxford, 1851). </p>
 
 <p>The missing Books II. and III. dealt respectively with the doctrines and mysteries of the Egyptians and with those of the Chaldæans. Hippolytus (Proœm.) boasts that he has divulged all their mysteries, as well as the secrets of those Christian mystics whom he stigmatises as heretics, and to whom he devotes Books V.-IX. </p>
 
 <p>It is a curious fact that it is precisely those Books wherein this divulging of the Mysteries was attempted, which should be missing; not only have they disappeared, but in the Epitome at the beginning of Book X. the summary of their contents is also omitted. This seems almost to point to a deliberate removal of just </p>
 
 <p>
 </p>
 
 <p><a name="page_141"><font size="1" color="green">p. 141</font></a></p>
 
 <p>that information which would be of priceless value to us to-day, not only for the general history of the evolution of religious ideas, but also for filling in an important part of the background of the environment of infant Christianity. </p>
 
 <p>Why, then, were these books cut out? Were the subsequent Christian Orthodox deterred by religious scruples, or were they afraid to circulate this information? Hippolytus himself seems to have had no such hesitation; he is ever delightedly boasting that he is giving away to the multitude the most sacred secrets of others; it seems to have been his special <i>métier</i> to cry aloud on the house-tops what had been whispered in their secret chambers. It was for him a delicious triumph over “error” to boast, “I have your secret documents, and I am going to publish them!” </p>
 
 <p>Why, then, should those who came after him hesitate? Surely they were like-minded with Hippolytus, and would have been as delighted as himself in humbling the pride of the hated Mystery-institutions in the dust? Can it possibly be that they saw far more clearly than he did that quite other deductions might be drawn from his “startling revelations”? </p>
 
 <h5 align="center">THE NAASSENES </h5><p>That far other deductions could be drawn from the Mystery-rites and Mystery-myths was at anyrate the view of a tradition of early Jewish and Christian mystics whom Hippolytus calls Naassenes. The claim of these Gnostics was practically that Christianity, or rather the Good News of the Christ, was precisely the consummation of the inner doctrine of the Mystery-institutions of all the nations; the end of them all was the revelation of the Mystery of Man. </p>
 
 <p><a name="page_142"><font size="1" color="green">p. 142</font></a></p>
 
 <p>It is further to be noticed that these Naassenes, “who call themselves Gnostics” (v. 2), are the very first school of Christian “heresy” with which Hippolytus deals; he puts them in the forefront of his <i>Refutation,</i> as being, presumably, in his opinion, the oldest, or, at anyrate, as representing the most ancient form of Christian “heresy.” </p>
 
 <p>Although the name Naassene (Ναασσηνοί) is derived from the Hebrew <i>Naḥash</i> (Serpent), Hippolytus does not call them Ophites; indeed, he reserves the latter name to a body to which he also gives (viii. 20) the name Caïnites and Nochaïtæ (Νοχαϊταί)—? Nachaïtæ, again, from <i>Nachash</i> <a name="fr_304"></a><a href="#fn_304"><font size="1">1</font></a>—and considers them of not sufficient importance for further mention. </p>
 
 <p>These Naassenes possessed many secret books or <i>apocrypha</i>—that is, books kept back from general circulation—and also regarded as authoritative the following scriptures: <i>The Gospel of Perfection, The Gospel of Eve, The Questions of Mary,</i> <a name="fr_305"></a><a href="#fn_305"><font size="1">2</font></a> <i>Concerning the Offspring of Mary, The Gospel of Philip, The Gospel according to Thomas,</i> and <i>The Gospel according to the Egyptians.</i> All of which points somewhat to an Alexandrian or Egyptian circle. </p>
 
 <h5 align="center">ANALYSIS OF HIPPOLYTUS ACCOUNT OF THE NAASSENE DOCUMENT </h5>
 
 <p>One of their secret MSS. had fallen into the hands of Hippolytus. It is in the Bishop of Portus quotations </p>
 
 <p>
 </p>
 
 <p>
 </p>
 
 <p><a name="page_143"><font size="1" color="green">p. 143</font></a></p>
 
 <p>from this document that Reitzenstein (pp. 81 ff.) seeks to discover what he calls the “Hellenistic Myth of the God Anthrōpos.” His theory is that, by eliminating the Christian citations and thoughts of the Naassene writer, we are face to face with a purely Heathen document. </p>
 
 <p>The reproduction of their views, as given by Hippolytus, <a name="fr_306"></a><a href="#fn_306"><font size="1">1</font></a> falls according to Reitzenstein into three divisions. </p>
 
 <p>(i.) The first begins with the explanation of the name “Naassene” (S. 131, 1; C. 139, 1 <a name="fr_307"></a><a href="#fn_307"><font size="1">2</font></a>), and, after giving a few brief headings, ends (S. 134, 8; C. 141, 2) with the statement that the writer of the MS. said they had their tradition from James, the Brother of the Lord, who had delivered it to Mariamnē. </p>
 
 <p>(iii.) The third begins (S. 170, 64; C. 178, 1) with another explanation of the name. In both of these parts are found remains of hymns from some liturgical collection. </p>
 
 <p>(ii.) Between i. and ii. lies a longer exposition in which Hippolytus tries to show that the Naassene doctrines are taken from the Mysteries, culminating in the assertion that the Naassenes, as a matter of fact, were nothing else than sectaries of the Mysteries of the Mother of the Gods, in proof of which he quotes at length from a secret document of their school. </p>
 
 <p>Our interest in these quotations, however, is very different from that of Hippolytus, for, as Reitzenstein has now shown, it is manifest on inspection that the Christian quotations and thoughts in this document </p>
 
 <p>
 </p>
 
 <p>
 </p>
 
 <p><a name="page_144"><font size="1" color="green">p. 144</font></a></p>
 
 <p>violently disrupt its underlying continuity, and that they are for the most part easily removable without damage to the sense. </p>
 
 <p>With regard to the Old Testament quotations it is not always so easy to disentangle them from the Hellenistic source, much less from the New Testament quotations; the phenomena, however, presented by them are of such a nature that, in my opinion, there is ample evidence before us that there was a Jewish working-over of the matter before it came into the hands of the Christian overwriter. Reitzenstein, however, does not venture so far. </p>
 
 <p>Even, then, if we were content with Reitzensteins analysis only, it is quite clear that the quotations from the Old Testament formed no part of the original; and that we have, therefore, before us what was once a purely Heathen text, with Gnostic Christian <i>scholia,</i> or rather overworked by a Christian Gnostic. The original Pagan text had, accordingly, been cut up by the Naassene overwriter before ever it came into the hands of Hippolytus. </p>
 
 <p>Now, as the Christianised text must have been for some time in private circulation before it reached the library of the Bishop of Portus <a name="fr_308"></a><a href="#fn_308"><font size="1">1</font></a>—even if we make no allowance for a Jewish Hellenistic stratum of overwriting, still seeing that Hippolytus own view was that, in the Naassene MS., he had before him a basic document of those whom he regarded as the earliest Christian “heretics”—it is quite evident that if we were to place the date of the original Hellenistic source in the first century, we should not be doing violence even to the ecclesiastical traditional absurdity that Gnosticism first sullied the orthodox purity of the Church only </p>
 
 <p>
 </p>
 
 <p><a name="page_145"><font size="1" color="green">p. 145</font></a></p>
 
 <p>in the reign of Trajan (96-117 A.D.). But we will return to the question of date later on. </p>
 
 <p>As the whole matter is not only one of considerable interest for the student of our treatises, but also of the greatest importance for the student of the history of Gnosticism, I shall give a translation of Hippolytus introductory and concluding sections, as well as of the intermediate section which specially concerns us, so that the reader may have a view of the whole medley as it comes to us from the hands of the heresy-hunting bishop. </p>
 
 <p>I shall, moreover, proceed a stage further in the analysis of the material of Hippolytus than Reitzenstein has done, and hope, when the evidence has been laid before the reader, to win his assent to what appears to me to be the natural sifting out of the various elements, with resultant phenomena which are of the greatest importance for the history of Gnosticism, and, therefore, of the evolution of Christian dogmatics, and which lead to conclusions that are far too serious to be treated in the short space of a single chapter of our present essay.</p>
 
 <p>In the following analysis H. stands for Hippolytus; C. for the Christian Gnostic final overwriter, the “Naassene” whose MS. lay before H.; J. for the Naassene Jewish mystic who preceded C. and overworked the original; S. for the original Heathen Hellenistic Source. </p>
 
 <p>As H. and C. are of secondary importance for our immediate enquiry, though of themselves of the greatest value and interest, I shall print them in smaller type. J. I shall print in the same type as S., as nearer in contact with S. than C., and as being sometimes more difficult to detach from S. than from C. </p>
 
 <p>The reader, to have the text of Hippolytus before him, must neglect all the critical indications and read straight on. </p>
 
 <p><a name="page_146"><font size="1" color="green">p. 146</font></a></p>
 
 <p>With these brief preliminary indications we will, then, present the reader with a translation of the first section, or introductory part, <a name="fr_309"></a><a href="#fn_309"><font size="1">1</font></a> of Hippolytus exposure or exposition of the Naassene doctrines, begging him to remember throughout that it is a portrait painted by the hand of one of their bitterest foes. </p>
 
 <h5 align="center">HIPPOLYTUS INTRODUCTION </h5>
 
 <p><span style="font-size: small">H. The priests and chiefs of [this] doctrine <a name="fr_310"></a><a href="#fn_310"><font size="1">2</font></a> were first of all those who were called Naasseni—so named in Hebrew, [in which] “serpent” is called <i>naas</i>. <a name="fr_311"></a><a href="#fn_311"><font size="1">3</font></a> But subsequently they called themselves Gnostics, pretending that they alone knew the Depths. </span></p>
 
 <p><span style="font-size: small">From these many separated themselves and [so] turned the school, which was originally a single one, into numerous sects, setting forth the same ideas in various doctrinal forms, as our argument will show as it advances. </span></p>
 
 <p><span style="font-size: small">These [Naassenes] honour as the Logos (Reason) of all universals <a name="fr_312"></a><a href="#fn_312"><font size="1">4</font></a> Man, and Son of Man.

These hymns—to dispose of them briefly—run somewhat as follows: </span></p>
 
 <p>J. “From Thee [is] Father, and Through Thee <a name="fr_315"></a><a href="#fn_315"><font size="1">7</font></a> Mother—the two Immortal Names, <a name="fr_316"></a><a href="#fn_316"><font size="1">8</font></a> Parents of Æons, O Thou who hast the Heaven for Thy City, O Man of Mighty Names.” <a name="fr_317"></a><a href="#fn_317"><font size="1">9</font></a> </p>

And they divide him into three, like Gēryōnēs; <a name="fr_318"></a><a href="#fn_318"><font size="1">1</font></a> for, they say, he has a mental, psychic, and choïc [aspect]; <a name="fr_319"></a><a href="#fn_319"><font size="1">2</font></a> and they think that the Gnosis of <a name="fr_320"></a><a href="#fn_320"><font size="1">3</font></a> this [Man] is the beginning of the possibility of knowing God, saying: </span></p>
 
 <p>J. The beginning of Perfection [is] the Gnosis of Man, but the Gnosis of God is perfected Perfection. <a name="fr_321"></a><a href="#fn_321"><font size="1">4</font></a> </p>
 
 <p><span style="font-size: small">H. All these, he says <a name="fr_322"></a><a href="#fn_322"><font size="1">5</font></a>—mental, psychic, and earthy—descended together into one man—Jesus, born of Mary. </span></p>
 
 <p><span style="font-size: small">And these three Men, he says, spake each from their own special essences to their own special folk. </span></p>
 
 <p><span style="font-size: small">For of the universal principles there are three kinds [or races]—the angelic, psychic, and earthy; and three churches—angelic, psychic, and earthy named the Elect, Called, and Bound. </span></p>
 
 <p><span style="font-size: small">These are the chief heads from a very large number of doctrines, <a name="fr_323"></a><a href="#fn_323"><font size="1">6</font></a> which, he says, James, the Brother of the Lord, handed on to Mariamnē. <a name="fr_324"></a><a href="#fn_324"><font size="1">7</font></a> </span></p>

 <p><span style="font-size: small">But in order that we may put an end to the lying accounts of these impious [heretics] concerning Mariamnē, and James, and the Saviour Himself, <a name="fr_325"></a><a href="#fn_325"><font size="1">1</font></a> let us come to the Initiations from which they get this myth—if you like [to call it so]—to the non-Grecian and Grecian [Initiations]; and let us see how, by combining together the secret Mysteries of all the Gentiles which must not be spoken of, and by telling lies about the Christ, they take in those who do not know that these things are the Orgies of the Gentiles. </span></p>
 
 <p><span style="font-size: small">Now, since the foundation of their system is Man Adamas, and they say it has been written of him, “Who shall declare his generation?” <a name="fr_326"></a><a href="#fn_326"><font size="1">2</font></a>—learn how they have taken the undiscoverable and contradictory generation of Man and plastered it on the Christ.</span></p>

 <p>it was the Idæan Kurētes, race divine, or the Phrygian Korybantes, whom Helios saw first sprouting forth tree-like; or whether Arkadia brought forth Pelasgos [first], older than the Moon; or Eleusis Diaulos, dweller in Raria; or Lēmnos Kabeiros, fair child of ineffable orgies; <a name="fr_329"></a><a href="#fn_329"><font size="1">1</font></a> or whether Pallēnē Phlegræan Alkyoneus, eldest of Giants. </p>

 <p>(3) S. And they <a name="fr_335"></a><a href="#fn_335"><font size="1">4</font></a> say that Soul is very difficult to discover, and hard to understand; for it never remains of the same appearance, or form, or in the same state, so that one can describe it by a general type, <a name="fr_336"></a><a href="#fn_336"><font size="1">5</font></a> or comprehend it by an essential quality. </p>

 <h5 align="center">CONCLUSION OF ANALYSIS 
 </h5>
 <p>All this may have seemed, quite naturally, contemptible foolishness to the theological prejudices of 
 our worthy Church Father; but it is difficult for me, 
 even in the twentieth century, not to recognise the 
 beauty of this fine Mystic Hymn, and I hope it may be 
 equally difficult for at least some of my readers. </p>
 
 <p>But to return to the consideration of our much overwritten Source. </p>
 
 <p>This Source is plainly a commentary, or elaborate 
 paraphrase, of the Recitation Ode, “Whether, blest Child 
 of Kronos,” which comes at the end (§ 30) and not, as 
 we should expect, at the beginning, and has probably 
 been displaced by Hippolytus. It is an exegetical </p>

 <p>commentary written from the standpoint of the 
 Anthrōpos-theory of the Mysteries (? originally Chaldæan), the Man-doctrine. </p>
 
 <p>This commentary seems for the most part to run on 
 so connectedly, that we can almost persuade ourselves 
 that we have most of it before us, the <i>lacunæ</i> being 
 practically insignificant. Paragraphs 6 and 7 S., however, are plainly misplaced, and §§ 17 and 18 S. also 
 as evidently break the connection. <a name="fr_594"></a><a href="#fn_595"><font size="1">1</font></a> </p>
 
 <h5 align="center">THE HELLENIST COMMENTATOR </h5>
 
 <p>The writer is transparently a man learned in the 
 various Mystery-rites, and his information is of the 
 greatest possible importance for a study of this exceedingly obscure subject from an historical standpoint. </p>
 
 <p>With § 8 S., and the Egyptian Mystery-doctrine, we 
 come to what is of peculiar interest for our present 
 Trismegistic studies. Osiris is the Heavenly Man, the 
 Logos; not only so, but in straitest connection with 
 this tradition we have an exposition of the Hermes-doctrine, set forth by a system of allegorical interpretations of the Bible of Hellas—the Poems of the 
 Homeric cycle. Here we have the evident <i>syncrasia</i> 
 Thoth = Osiris = Hermes, a Hermes of the “Greek 
 Wisdom,” as the Recitation Ode phrases it, and a 
 doctrine which H., basing himself on the commentator 
 (§ 10), squarely asserts the Greeks got from Egypt. </p>
 
 <p>Nor is it without importance for us that in closest 
 connection with Hermes there follow the apparently 
 misplaced sections 17 and 18, dealing with the 
 “Heavenly Horn,” or drinking-horn, of the Greek 
 Wisdom, and the “Cup” of Anacreon; with which we 
 may compare the <i>Crater,</i> Mixing-bowl or Cup, in which, </p>
 
 <p>
 </p>
 
 <p><a name="page_194"><font size="1" color="green">p. 194</font></a></p>
 
 <p>according to Platos <i>Timæus,</i> the Creator mingled and 
 mixed the elements and souls, and also the spiritual 
 Cup of the Mind in our Trismegistic treatise, “The 
 Crater or Monas,” <i>C. H.,</i> iv. (v.). </p>
 
 <p>But above all things is it astonishing that we should 
 find the commentator in S. quoting (§ 9) a <i>logos</i> from 
 a document which, as we have shown in the note 
 appended to the passage, is in every probability a 
 Trismegistic treatise of the Pœmandres type. </p>
 
 <h5 align="center">THE JEWISH AND CHRISTIAN OVERWRITERS </h5>
 
 <p>This commentary S. was worked over by a Jewish 
 Hellenistic mystic J., whose general ideas and method 
 of exegesis are exactly paralleled by those of Philo. 
 In my opinion, he was a contemporary of that period 
 and a member of one of those communities whom Philo 
 classes generally as Therapeut. He was, moreover, 
 not a worshipper of the serpent, but a worshipper of 
 that Glorious Reality symbolised as the Serpent 
 of Wisdom, and this connects him with initiation 
 into Egypto-Chaldæan or Chaldæo-Egyptian Mysteries. 
 These he finds set forth allegorically in the prophetical 
 scriptures of his race. His quotations from the LXX. 
 show him to be, like Philo, an Alexandrian Hellenistic 
 Jew; the LXX. was his Targum. </p>
 
 <p>J. again was overwritten by C., a Christian Gnostic, 
 no enemy of either J. or S., but one who claimed that 
 he and his were the true realisers of all that had gone 
 before; he is somewhat boastful, but yet recognises 
 that the Christ-doctrine is not an innovation but a 
 consummation. The phenomena presented by the New 
 Testament quotations of C. are, in my opinion, of extraordinary interest, especially his quotations from or 
 parallels with the Fourth Gospel. His quotations from </p>
 
 <p><a name="page_195"><font size="1" color="green">p. 195</font></a></p>
 
 <p>
 or parallels with the Synoptics are almost of the same 
 nature as those of Justin; he is rather dealing with 
 “Memoirs of the Apostles” than with verbatim quotations from our stereotyped Gospels. His parallels 
 with the Fourth Gospel also seem to me to open up the 
 question as to whether or no he is in touch with 
 “Sources” of that “Johannine” document. </p>
 
 <p>On top of all our strata and deposits, we have—to 
 continue the metaphor of excavation, and if it be not 
 thought somewhat uncharitable—the refutatory rubbish 
 of Hippolytus, which need no longer detain us here. </p>
 
 <p>I would, therefore, suggest that C. is to be placed 
 somewhere about the middle of the second century A.D.; 
 J. is contemporary with Philo—say the first quarter of 
 the first century A.D.; the Pagan commentator of S. is 
 prior to J.—say somewhere in the last half of the first 
 century B.C.; while the Recitation Ode is still earlier, 
 and can therefore be placed anywhere in the early 
 Hellenistic period, the <i>termini</i> being thus 300-50 B.C. <a name="fr_595"></a><a href="#fn_596"><font size="1">1</font></a> </p>
 
 <p>And if the redactor or commentator in S. is to 
 be placed somewhere in the last half of the first 
 century B.C. (and this is, of course, taking only the 
 <i>minimum</i> of liberty), then the Pœmandres type of 
 our literature, which J. quotes as scripture, must, in its 
 original Greek form, be placed back of that—say at 
 least in the first half of the first century B.C., as a 
 moderate estimate. <a name="fr_596"></a><a href="#fn_597"><font size="1">2</font></a> If those dates are not proved, </p>
 
 <p>
 </p>
 
 <p>
 </p>
 
 <p><a name="page_196"><font size="1" color="green">p. 196</font></a></p>
 
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> I am at anyrate fairly confident they cannot be 
 disproved. </p>
 
 <h5 align="center">ZOSIMUS AND THE ANTHROPOS-DOCTRINE </h5>
 
 <p>That, moreover, the Anthrōpos-doctrine, to the spirit 
 of which the whole commentary of our S. exegete is 
 accommodated, was also fundamental with the adherents of the Trismegistic tradition, may be clearly 
 seen from the interesting passage (which we give in the 
 Fragments at the end of the third Volume) of Zosimus, 
 a member of what Reitzenstein calls the Pœmandres 
 Community, who flourished somewhere at the end of 
 the third and beginning of the fourth century A.D. <a name="fr_597"></a><a href="#fn_598"><font size="1">1</font></a> </p>
 
 <p>The sources of Zosimus for the Anthrōpos-doctrine, 
 he tells us, are, in addition to the Books of Hermes, 
 certain translations into Greek and Egyptian of books 
 containing traditions (mystery-traditions, presumably) 
 of the Chaldæans, Parthians, Medes, and Hebrews on 
 the subject. This statement is of the very first importance for the history of Gnosticism as well as for 
 appreciating certain elements in Trismegisticism. 
 Though the indication of this literature is vague, it 
 nevertheless mentions four factors as involved in the 
 Hebrew tradition; the Gnostic Hebrews, as we should </p>
 
 <p>
 </p>
 
 <p><a name="page_197"><font size="1" color="green">p. 197</font></a></p>
 
 <p>
 expect, were handing on elements from Chaldæan, 
 Parthian, and Median traditions. Translations of these 
 books were to be found scattered throughout Egypt, 
 and especially in the great library at Alexandria. </p>
 
 <p>There is, in my opinion, no necessity precisely, with 
 Reitzenstein (p. 106, n. 6), to designate these books the 
 “Ptolemaic Books,” and so to associate them with a 
 notice found in the apocryphal “Eighth Book of 
 Moses,” where, together with that of the <i>Archangelic 
 Book of Moses,</i> there is mention of the Fifth Book of the 
 “Ptolemaic Books,” described as a book of multifarious 
 wisdom under the title “One and All,” and containing 
 the account of the “Genesis of Fire and Darkness.” <a name="fr_598"></a><a href="#fn_599"><font size="1">1</font></a> </p>
 
 <p>Another source of Zosimus was the <i>Pinax</i> of Bitos 
 or Bitys, of whom we shall treat in considering the 
 information of Jamblichus. </p>
 
 <p>From all of these indications we are assured that 
 there was already in the first centuries B.C. a well-developed Hellenistic doctrine of the descent of man 
 from the Man Above, and of his return to that heavenly 
 state by his mastery of the powers of the cosmos. </p>
 
 <h5 align="center">PHILO OF ALEXANDRIA ON THE MAN-DOCTRINE </h5>
 
 <p>This date is further confirmed by the testimony of 
 Philo (<i>c.</i> 30 B.C.-45 A.D.). </p>
 
 <p>For, quoting the verse: “We are all sons of One 
 Man,” <a name="fr_599"></a><a href="#fn_600"><font size="1">2</font></a> he addresses those who are “companions of 
 wisdom and knowledge” as those who are “Sons of 
 one and the same Father—no mortal father, but an 
 immortal Sire, the Man of God, who being the Reason 
 (<i>Logos</i>) of the Eternal, is of necessity himself eternal.” <a name="fr_600"></a><a href="#fn_601"><font size="1">3</font></a> </p>

 “And if a man should not as yet have the good 
 fortune to be worthy to be called Son of God, let him 
 strive manfully to set himself in order <a name="fr_601"></a><a href="#fn_602"><font size="1">1</font></a> according to 
 His First-born Reason (<i>Logos</i>), the Oldest Angel, who is 
 as though it were the Angel-chief of many names; for 
 he is called Dominion, and Name of God, and Reason, 
 and Man-after-His-Likeness, and Seeing Israel. </p>
 
 <p>“And for this reason I was induced a little before 
 to praise the principles of those who say: We are 
 all sons of One Man. For even if we have not yet 
 become fit to be judged Sons of God, we may at any 
 rate be Sons of His Eternal Likeness, His Most Holy 
 Reason (<i>Logos</i>); for Reason, the Eldest of all Angels, 
 is Gods Likeness [or Image].” <a name="fr_602"></a><a href="#fn_603"><font size="1">2</font></a> </p>
 <p></p>
 
 <p>Thus Philo gives us additional proof, if more were 
 needed, for the full Anthrōpos-doctrine was evidently 
 fundamental in his circle—that is to say, in the 
 thought-atmosphere of the Hellenistic theology, or the 
 religio-philosophy, or theosophy, of his day, the beginning of the first century A.D. </p>
 
 <p>This date alone is sufficient for our purpose; but it 
 is not too bold a statement even to say that the 
 Man-Mystery was a fundamental concept of the 
 brilliant period of the Hellenistic syncretism which 
 succeeded to the founding of Alexandria—the period 
 of the expansion of Hellas beyond her national borders; 
 in other words, her birth into the greater world. </p>
 
 <p>It is enough to know that the Mystery was hidden 
 and yet revealed in the shadow-garments of Chaldæan, 
 Babylonian, Magian, Phœnician, Hebrew, Egyptian, 
 Phrygian, Thracian, and Greek mystery-traditions. It 
 was, in brief, fundamental in all such wisdom-shows, 
 and necessarily so, for it was the Christ-Mystery. </p>

 <p><a name="fn_324"></a><a href="th110.htm#fr_324">147:7</a> Celsus (c. 150-175 A.D.) knows of groups of Harpocratians—that is, worshippers of Horus—some of whom derived their tradition from Salōmē, others from Mariamnē, and others again from Martha (Origen, <i>C. Celsum,</i> v. 62). This suggests an Egyptian setting. (For Salome and Maria or Miriam (Mariamnē), the Sisters of Jesus, see <i>D. J. L.,</i> 405 f .; for Martha, Our Lady, see <i>ibid.,</i> 375 ff.) In the Gnostic <i>Acts of Philip,</i> Mariamnē, or Mariammē (both forms being found in the MSS., according to R. A. Lipsius, <i>Die apokr. Apostelgeschichten</i>—Brunswick, 1884—iii. 12), is the “virgin sister” of Philip, and plays an important <i>rôle</i> as prophetess. She is to Philip as Thekla to Paul, or Helen to Simon. Compare with this the “sister wife” whom Paul demands the right to take about like “the rest of the Apostles and the Brethren of the Lord and Cephas” (1 Corinth. ix. 5; <i>D. J. L.,</i> 229). Salmon (art. “Mariamne” in Smith and Waces <i>D. of Christ. Biog.,</i> iii. 830) refers to the Mary (Magdalene) of the <i>Pistis Sophia,</i> the chief questioner of the Master and His favourite disciple, the sister of Martha. The tradition of the Gnosis from James, the Brother of the Lord, is asserted by Clement of Alexandria in Book VI. of his lost work, <i>The Institutions,</i> where he writes: “The Lord imparted the Gnosis to James the Just, to John and Peter, after His resurrection; these delivered it to the rest of the Apostles, and they to the Seventy” (Euseb., <i>Hist. Eccles.,</i> ii. 1; <i>cf. D. J. L.,</i> 226).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_325"></a><a href="th110.htm#fr_325">148:1</a> From here onwards we use the revised critical text of Reitzenstein (pp. 83-98), who appends what we may call an <i>apparatus criticus</i> of the emendations and conjectures of the various editions of our solitary MS.

 <p><a name="fn_330"></a><a href="th110.htm#fr_330">149:2</a> In Greek transformation, son of Apollo and the daughter of Minos, born in Libya. This points to a very ancient myth-connection with the old Cretan civilisation. Garamas was also called Amphithemis (q.v. in Roschers <i>Lex</i>.); he appears also, according to one tradition, to have been the father of Ammon. (See “Garamantis Nympha,” <i>ibid</i>.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_331"></a><a href="th110.htm#fr_331">149:3</a> This passage is doubly interesting, for it is not only a source, but a source within a source. Already a number of scholars have recognised it as an Ode; and not only so, but conjectured with much probability that it is by no less a master than Pindar himself. Nay, further, it is part of a Hymn to Jupiter Ammon—an additionally interesting point for us as showing strong Egyptian influence. It is true that in our text of Hippolytus the order of the words has been frequently changed to bring it into prose form; but the reconstruction of most of it is not difficult, and quite convincing. I translate from the text of Bergks final revision, as given S. 134, 135; C. 142. R., for some reason or other, does not refer to this interesting side-light.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_339"></a><a href="th110.htm#fr_339">150:8</a> That is from Man (Father), Man Son of Man (Son), or Flowing Chaos (Mother)—corresponding in Hellenic mythology to Kronos, Zeus, and Rhea. For Rhea (from ρέειν, “to flow”) is the Moist or Liquid Nature, as with the Stoics; she is the <i>a</i>-cosmic or unordered Earth, the Prima Materia (the First Earth, the Spouse of Heaven—Uranus), Hyle Proper, who carries in her bosom the Logos. For references, see R., p. 99, n. 2.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_340"></a><a href="th110.htm#fr_340">151:1</a> <i>Cf.</i> Ex. viii. 8.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_341"></a><a href="th110.htm#fr_341">151:2</a> The preceding paragraph is evidently composed of selections from S. R. (p. 85, n. 1) thinks that we have here the description of only one aspect of Soul, and that the description of the remaining two aspects has been omitted by H.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_345"></a><a href="th110.htm#fr_345">152:3</a> This paragraph and § 7, together with the accompanying overworkings, seem to have been misplaced by H., according to R. (pp. 99, 100).<br><br>The sudden introduction of the name Attis without any preliminaries, indicates another <i>lacuna</i>; the transition from the Assyrian to the Phrygian Mysteries of the Great Mother is too brusque.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_346"></a><a href="th110.htm#fr_346">152:4</a> The threefold nature of the Soul is thus distinguished by: (i.) The union (or marriage) which joins it to generation, or to earth-life—the nature of things on earth; (ii.) The union which joins it with death—the nature of the things “beneath” the earth; (iii.) The union which joins it with formal beauty, or beauty in form (μορφή)—the nature of super-terrene (or sublunary) things, here regarded as the Elysian state. <br><br>The love of the Mother of the Gods for the Soul represents the “fourth state” (the <i>turīya</i> of Vedantic mystic psychology), or the absorption of the masculine power of the Soul by its own higher Feminine Nature. <i>Cf.</i> in Damascius “Life of Isidores” (Photius, <i>Bibl.,</i> ed. Bekker, 345 a. 5: “I fell asleep, and in a vision Attis seemed to appear to me, and, on behalf of the Mother of the Gods, to initiate me into the feast called Hilaria—a mystery which discloses the way of our salvation from Hades.” Hades, the realm of Selēnē, is not Tartarus, the realm of Death.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_347"></a><a href="th110.htm#fr_347">153:1</a> Compare the so-called <i>Second Epistle of Clement</i> (an early homily incorporating extra-canonical Gospel-materials), xii. 2: “For the Lord Himself being asked by some one when his Kingdom should come, said: When the two shall be one, and the outside as the inside, and the male with the female neither male nor female”; and also the well-known <i>logoi,</i> from <i>The Gospel according to the Egyptians,</i> quoted several times by Clement of Alexandria: “When Salome asked how long Death should prevail, the Lord said: So long as ye women bear children; for I am come to destroy the work of the Female. And Salome said to Him: Did I therefore well in bearing no children? The Lord answered and said: Eat every Herb, but eat not that which hath bitterness. When Salome asked when these things about which she questioned should be made known, the Lord said: When ye trample upon the Garment of Shame; when the Two become One, and Male with Female neither male nor female.” And with the last logos of the above compare the new-found fragment of a lost Gospel: “His disciples say unto Him: When wilt thou be manifest to us, and when shall we see Thee? He saith: When ye shall be stripped and not be ashamed.”—Grenfell and Hunt, <i>New Sayings of Jesus</i> (London, 1904), p. 40. The environment is Egyptian and ascetic; it is a saying addressed to a community, as may be seen from one of the previous <i>logoi</i>: “Having one garment what do ye [lack]?”</p>

 <p><a name="fn_351"></a><a href="th110.htm#fr_351">153:5</a> The received Pauline text is slightly shortened here.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_352"></a><a href="th110.htm#fr_352">154:1</a> Evidently a reference to the Chaldæan fourfold (man-eagle-lion-bull) glyph of what Later Orphicism and Platonism called the Autozōon, representing the four main types of Animal Life; the same mystery which Ezekiel saw in the Vision of the Mercabah, or Celestial Chariot—a reflected picture, I believe, from the Chaldæan Mysteries.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_353"></a><a href="th110.htm#fr_353">154:2</a> Verses 24 and 25 of the Received Text are omitted.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_357"></a><a href="th110.htm#fr_357">154:6</a> We wonder what “they” really did say? They may have argued in their private circles that even in the foulest things the clean soul could recognise the reversed signs of the Mysteries of Purity; for certainly these things require an explanation—nay, more urgently do they require an interpretation in proportion to their foulness. The hateful suggestion of Hippolytus that these ascetic and spiritually-minded folk—for their doctrines plainly show them to be so—were as foul as those of the Flood, only shows the ineradicable prejudice of unwitting self-righteousness.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_369"></a><a href="th110.htm#fr_369">156:4</a> Prov. xxiv. 16—same reading as LXX. <i>Cf.</i> Luke xvii. 4.: “If he trespass against thee seven times in a day and turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive.” This saying is apparently from the “Logia” source; <i>cf.</i> Matt, xviii. 21, and compare the idea with the scheme of the “repentance” of the <i>Pistis Sophia</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_370"></a><a href="th110.htm#fr_370">156:5</a> The seven planetary spheres; but it may also connect with the idea of the falling “stars” as the souls descending into matter, according to the Platonic and Hermetic doctrine.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_371"></a><a href="th110.htm#fr_371">156:6</a> Probably the Egyptians in their Mysteries, connecting with what is summarised by H. at end of § 6 and beginning of § 7.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_372"></a><a href="th110.htm#fr_372">157:1</a> Evidently a <i>logos</i> from some Hellenistic scripture. In the evidence of Zosimus which we adduce at the end of our Trismegistic Fragments, he quotes (§§ 15 and 7) from the “Inner Door”—a lost treatise of Hermes Trismegistus—as follows: “For that the Son of God having power in all things, becoming all things that He willeth, appeareth as He willeth to each.” Thus we have S. quoting the original <i>logos,</i> which, I suggest, belongs to the “Pœmandres” type of Trismegistic literature. Therefore that type was in existence before S. This confirms our attribution of the “they declare” to the Egyptians and their Mysteries (Trismegisticism being principally the Hellenised form of those Mysteries), and also the completion of R. at the end of the first paragraph of § 7 above.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_373"></a><a href="th110.htm#fr_373">157:2</a> <i>Cf.</i> Matt. xix. 17 = Mark x. 18 = Luke xviii. 19. The first clause agrees with Mark and Luke, the second with Matthew (omitting “the” before “Good”).

 <p><a name="fn_374"></a><a href="th110.htm#fr_374">157:3</a> A different form from Matt. v. 45, but the same idea; for the other tradition, see Luke vi. 35.</p>

The name, however, appears in the system of Justinus (Hipp., <i>Philos.,</i> v. 26) as Esaddaios, evidently the transliteration of El Shaddai, as one of the twelve Paternal Angels, the Sons of Elohim, the Demiurge of the sensible world, and of Eden, the Maternal Potency or Nature.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_392"></a><a href="th110.htm#fr_392">160:7</a> <i>Cf.</i> Plutarch, <i>De Is. et Os.,</i> xxxiv. After saying that Osiris, or the Logos, is symbolised as Ocean and Water, and that Thales took his idea of Primal “Water, as the cause of things, from the Egyptians, the initiated priest of Apollo and learned comparative mythologist continues: “The Greeks say that son (ὑιόν) comes from water (ὕδατος) and to moisten (ὕσαι), and they call Dionysus Hyes (ὕην) as Lord of the Moist (ὑγρᾶς) Nature, he being the same as Osiris.” Stoll in Roschers <i>Lex</i>. (<i>sub vv.</i>) says that “Hyēs” and “Hyē” were respectively designations of Dionysus and Semele, and that the meaning is the “Moistener” and the “Moistened” (references <i>loc. cit.</i>). The nymphs who reared Bacchus were also called Hyades (<i>Pherecydes,</i> 46; p. 108, ed. Sturz). Hyēs was also a popular epithet of Zeus as god of rain. See also Lobeck, <i>Aglaophamus,</i> 782 and 1045 ff.; <i>Anecd.,</i> Bekk., p. 202: Some say that Hyēs = Attis, others that Hyēs = Dionysus; “for Zeus poured (ὕσε) ambrosia upon him.” One of the names of Bacchus was Ambrosia (Pherecy., <i>ibid.</i>; Non., xxi. 20). I would therefore suggest that the mystic cry “Hye Kye” meant “O Moistener beget!”</p>

Alexandrian) Hebrew poet writing in Greek. In these fragments of Ezechiels tragedy, Mariam, Sepphōra, and Jothōr are all <i>dramatis personæ</i>.

 <p><a name="fn_420"></a><a href="th110.htm#fr_420">165:4</a> These three names are based on the Hebrew text of Is. xxviii. 13, A.V.: “But the Word of the Lord was unto them precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, there a little.” LXX.: “καὶ ἔσται αὐτοῖς τὸ λόγιον κυρίου τοῦ θεοῦ, θλῖψις ἐπὶ θλῖψιν ἐλπὶς ἐπ ἐλπίδι, ἔτι μικρὸν ἔτι μικρόν.” That is: “And the <i>logion</i> [oracle, the Urim-and-Thummim, or instrument of the Logos, according to Philo] of God shall be to them tribulation on tribulation, hope on hope, still little still little.” See Epiphanius, <i>Hær.,</i> xxv. 4. “<i>Saulasau saulasau</i>” = “tribulation on tribulation, tribulation on tribulation;” “<i>kaulakau kaulakau</i>” = “hope on hope, hope on hope;” “<i>zeēsar</i> [<i>zeēsar</i>]” = “still little still little”—that is, the “Height of Hope,” the “Depth of Tribulation,” and the “As yet Very Little”—evidently referring to the as yet small number of the Regenerate. <i>Cf. Pistis Sophia,</i> 354: “One out of a thousand, and two out of ten thousand.” See Salmons article, “Caulacau,” in Smith and Waces <i>D. of Ch. Biog.,</i> i. 424 f. It is also to be noticed that Epiphanius ascribes the origin of these names to the Nicolaïtans. In Hebrew the corresponding name would be Balaamites; and Balaam or Bileam (Nico-laus) was one of the Rabbinical by-names for Jeschu (Jesus). See <i>D. J. L.,</i> p. 188.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_421"></a><a href="th110.htm#fr_421">165:5</a> This and the following paragraph seem to have been misplaced by J. or C., for § 19 connects directly with the exposition concerning the ithyphallic Hermes. See R. 100, n. 4.</p>

But the “third and fourth” are apparently both “fiery”—the former giving “light,” the latter “heat.” Compare § 23 C., who speaks of the third Gate, or entrance to the third Heaven. This Heaven, the third from below, would correspond with the first ætheric sphere—there being, presumably, three before the fourth or middle, the “Fiery Ruler.”</p>

 <p><a name="fn_502"></a><a href="th110.htm#fr_502">176:3</a> This is not very clear. But see Mozleys article, “Polus,” in Smith, Wayte, and Marindins <i>D. of Gk. and Rom. Antiquities</i> (London, 1891), ii. 442, 443: “Both in [Platos] <i>Timæus,</i> 40 B. and [Aristotles] <i>De Cælo,</i> ii. 14, πόλος is used, not for the entire heaven, but for the axis of heaven and earth, around which the whole revolved. Again in the <i>De Cælo,</i> ii. 2, the πόλοι are the poles, north and south, in our sense of the word.” Compare also the rubric in one of the rituals in the Greek Magic Papyri—C. Wessely, <i>Griechische Zauberpapyrus,</i> in <i>Denkschr. d. Akad., ph. hist. Kl.,</i> xxxvi. (Vienna, 1888)—where it is said that the Sun will then move towards the Pole, and the theurgist will see Seven Virgins (the Seven Fortunes of Heaven) approach, and Seven Youths, with heads of bulls (the Pole-lords of Heaven), who make the axis turn (661-670). Compare this with the “cylinder” idea in the fragment of <i>K. K.</i> Then there will appear the Great God “in a white robe and trowsers, with a crown of gold on his head, holding in his right hand the golden shoulder of a heifer, that is the Bear that sets in motion and keeps the heaven turning in due seasons.” This God will pronounce an oracle, and the theurgist will then receive the gift of divination. The special interest of this tradition is that it contains a Magian element (to wit, the “trowsers”), and this connects closely with Phrygia and the cult that was wedded most closely with the Mithriaca, namely, that of the Mother of the Gods.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_505"></a><a href="th110.htm#fr_505">177:2</a> Is. liv. 1; quoted also in Gal. iv. 27. <i>Cf.</i> Philo, <i>De Execrat.,</i> § 7; M. ii. 435, P. 936 (Ri. v. 254): “For when she [the Soul] is a multitude of passions and filled with vices, her children swarming over her—pleasures, appetites, folly, intemperance, unrighteousness, injustice—she is weak and sick, and lies at deaths door, dying; but when she becomes sterile, and ceases to bring them forth, or even casts them from her, forthwith, from the change, she becometh a chaste virgin, and, receiving the Divine Seed, she fashions and engenders marvellous excellencies that Nature prizeth highly—prudence, courage, temperance, justice, holiness, piety, and the rest of the virtues and good dispositions.”<br><br>There are, thus, seen to be identical ideas of a distinctly marked character in both J. and Philo. Did J., then, belong to Philos “circle”? Or, rather, did Philo represent a propagandist side of J.s circle? In other words, can we possibly have before us in J. a Therapeut allegorical exercise, based on S., by an exceedingly liberal-minded Hellenistic Jewish mystic?</p>

 <p><a name="fn_510"></a><a href="th110.htm#fr_510">178:5</a> See Cumont (F.), <i>Mystères de Mithra</i> (Brussels, 1898). In the monuments representing the bull-slaying myth of the Mithriaca, the bulls tail is frequently terminated in “<i>une truffe depis</i>”—the number varies, being either one, three, five, or seven. In the <i>Bundahish</i> all things are generated from the body, especially from the spinal marrow, of the slain bull. Sometimes the wheat-ears are represented as flowing like blood from the wound above the heart inflicted by the dagger of Mithras, the Bull-slayer (<i>op. cit.,</i> i. 186, 187). The constellation of the Wheat-ear in the Virgin, which was supposed to give good harvests, presumably refers to the same idea (<i>cf.</i> Eratosth., <i>Cataster.,</i> 9). See <i>op. cit.,</i> i. 202, 205, n. 2. The wheat-ear, therefore, symbolised in one aspect the “generative seed”—in animals and men-animals the spermatozoa, in man a mystery. Mithraicism had the closest connection with the Phrygian Mystery Cult; indeed, the Magna Mater Mysteries were used by it for the initiation of women, who were excluded from the Mithriaca proper.</p>

As Hatch says, in the tenth of his famous Hibbert Lectures for 1888: “And at night there were the mystic plays: the scenic representations, the drama in symbol and for sight. The torches were extinguished; they stood outside the Temple [in the Mystic Enclosure, presumably] in the silence and darkness. The door opened—there was a blaze of light—before them was enacted the drama.” Hatch (E.), <i>The Influence of Greek Ideas and Usages upon the Christian Church</i> (4th ed., London, 1892).

The quotation of this document by J., however, makes this opinion, in my view, entirely untenable.

 <p><a name="fn_583"></a><a href="th110.htm#fr_582">190:6</a> The text of this Hymn is in places very corrupt; I have followed Cruices emendations mostly. Schneidewin, for some reason or other which he does not state, omits it bodily from his Latin translation.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_584"></a><a href="th110.htm#fr_583">191:1</a> This attribution may be thought by some to be questionable; but as it is far more similar to the thought-sphere of J. than to that of C., I have so assigned it. It belonged to the same circles to which we must assign the sources of J.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_585"></a><a href="th110.htm#fr_584">191:2</a> γενικὸς—perhaps “general” simply.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_586"></a><a href="th110.htm#fr_585">191:3</a> Or, of the Whole.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_587"></a><a href="th110.htm#fr_586">191:4</a> The Codex has ἔλαφον, which, with Miller, we correct into ἐλάφου. Is this a parallel with the “lost sheep” idea? Can it possibly connect with the conception underlying the phrases on the golden tablets found in tombs of “Orphic” initiates, on the territory of ancient Sybaris: “A kid thou hast fallen into the milk” (“Timpone grande” Tablet <i>a,</i> Naples Museum, Kaibel, C.I.G.I.S., 642); and, “A kid I have fallen into milk” (“Campagno” Tablet <i>a, ibid.,</i> 641, and Append., p. 668)? But this connection is very hazy; it more probably suggests the <i>nebris</i> or “fawn-skin” of the Bacchic initiates (see my <i>Orpheus,</i> “The Fawn-skin,” pp. 243 ff., for an explanation). Cruice proposes to substitute ὑδαρὸν (“watery”); but there seems no reason why we should entirely reject the reading of the Codex, especially as C.s suggestion breaks the rule of the “more difficult” reading being the preferable.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_588"></a><a href="th110.htm#fr_587">191:5</a> βασιλείαν—kingdom or kingship.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_589"></a><a href="th110.htm#fr_588">191:6</a> The Codex reads εἶπεν διησοῦς ἐσὸρ. Can this possibly be a glossed and broken-down remains of Ἰαω Ζεησαρ (Iaō Zeēsar)?</p>
 <p><a name="fn_590"></a><a href="th110.htm#fr_589">192:1</a> Cruice thinks this refers to the breath of Gods anger; but surely it refers to the Holy Spirit of God?</p>

 <p><a name="fn_592"></a><a href="th110.htm#fr_591">192:3</a> <i>Cf.</i> “the bitter Water,” or “Darkness,” or “Chaos,” of the Sethian system in Hipp., <i>Philos.,</i> v. 19; and see the note to the comments following Hermes-Prayer v., p. 92.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_593"></a><a href="th110.htm#fr_592">192:4</a> The Logos in His descent through the spheres takes on the Forms of all the Powers.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_594"></a><a href="th110.htm#fr_593">192:5</a> Is it, however, possible that the original Hymn had Naas (Νάαν) and not Gnosis (Γνῶσιν)?</p>
 <p><a name="fn_595"></a><a href="th110.htm#fr_594">193:1</a> <i>Cf.</i> R. 99, 100; and 100, n. 4.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_596"></a><a href="th110.htm#fr_595">195:1</a> Wilamowitz hesitating attribution of it to the reign of Hadrian (117-138 A.D.) is, in my opinion, devoid of any objective support whatever. (See R., p. 102.) Reitzenstein himself (p. 165) would place it in the second century B.C.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_597"></a><a href="th110.htm#fr_596">195:2</a> Incidentally also it may be pointed out that this analysis gives the <i>coup de grâce</i> to Salmons contention (“The Cross-references in the Philosophumena,” <i>Hermathena,</i> 1885, v. 389 if.) that the great systems of the Gnosis made known to us only by Hippolytus are all the work of a single forger who imposed upon the credulity of the heresy-hunting Bishop of Portus. This contention, though to our mind one of the most striking instances of “the good Homer nodding,” was nevertheless practically endorsed by Stähelin (<i>Die gnostische Quellen Hippolyts in seiner Hauptschrift gegen die Haeretiken,</i> 1890; in <i>Texte u. Untersuchungen,</i> VI.), who went over the whole ground opened up by Salmon with minute and scrupulous industry. The general weakness of this extraordinary hypothesis of forgery has, however, been well pointed out by De Faye in his <i>Introduction à lÉtude du Gnosticisme au II<sup>e</sup> et au III<sup>e</sup> Siècle</i> (Paris, 1903), pp. 24 ff.; though De Faye also maintains a late date.</p>
