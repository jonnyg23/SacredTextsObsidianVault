 <h5 align="center">ON FISH TABOOS </h5>
 
 <p>VII. 1. As to sea-fish, all [Egyptians] abstain generally (not from all [fish] but) from some;—as, for example, those of the Oxyrhynchus nome from those caught with a hook, for as they venerate the sharp-snouted fish, <a name="fr_828"></a><a href="#fn_829"><font size="1">5</font></a> they fear that the hook <a name="fr_829"></a><a href="#fn_830"><font size="1">6</font></a> is not pure when “sharp-snout” is caught by it; <a name="fr_830"></a><a href="#fn_831"><font size="1">7</font></a> while those of the Syēnē nome [abstain from] the “devourer,” <a name="fr_831"></a><a href="#fn_832"><font size="1">8</font></a> for that it seems that it appears together with the rising of the Nile, and that it shows their <a name="fr_832"></a><a href="#fn_833"><font size="1">9</font></a> growth to those in joy, seen as a self-sent messenger. </p>

 <p><a name="page_270"><font size="1" color="green">p. 270</font></a></p>
 
 <p>2. Their priests, upon the other hand, abstain from all; and [even] on the ninth of the first month, <a name="fr_833"></a><a href="#fn_834"><font size="1">1</font></a> when every one of the rest of the Egyptians eats a broiled fish before his front door, <a name="fr_834"></a><a href="#fn_835"><font size="1">2</font></a> the priests do not taste it, but burn <i>their</i> fishes to ashes before the doors [of the Temple]. <a name="fr_835"></a><a href="#fn_836"><font size="1">3</font></a> </p>
 
 <p>3. And they have two reasons [for this], of which I will later on take up the sacred and extraordinary [one], according with the facts religiously deduced concerning Osiris and Typhon. The evident, the one thats close at hand, in showing forth the fish as a not necessary and a not unsuperfluous cooked food, bears witness unto Homer, who makes neither the Phæacians of luxurious lives, nor yet the Ithakēsian Island men, use fish, nor yet Odysseuss Companions <a name="fr_836"></a><a href="#fn_837"><font size="1">4</font></a> in so great a Voyage and on the Sea before they came to the last Strait. <a name="fr_837"></a><a href="#fn_838"><font size="1">5</font></a> </p>
 
 <p>4. And generally [the priests] think that the seas from fire and is beyond the boundaries—nor part nor element [of earth], but of another kind, a superfluity cor-rupted and cor-rupting. </p>

 <p><a name="fn_830"></a><a href="th119.htm#fr_829">269:6</a> ἄγκιστρον—dim. of ἄγκος, meaning a “bend” of any kind. Perhaps it may be intended as a play on the <i>ankh</i> tie or “noose of life,” the well-known Egyptian symbol, generally called the <i>crux ansata</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_831"></a><a href="th119.htm#fr_830">269:7</a> If we read αὑτῷ for αὐτῷ it would suggest a mystic meaning, namely, “falls into his own snare.”</p>
