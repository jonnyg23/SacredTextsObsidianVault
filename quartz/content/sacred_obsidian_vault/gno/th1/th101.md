 <h3 align="center">Preface</h3>
 
 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">These</span> volumes, complete in themselves as a series of 
 studies in a definite body of tradition, are intended to 
 serve ultimately as a small contribution to the preparation of the way leading towards a solution of the vast 
 problems involved in the scientific study of the Origins 
 of the Christian Faith. They might thus perhaps be 
 described as the preparation of materials to serve for 
 the historic, mythic, and mystic consideration of the 
 Origins of Christianity,—where the term “mythic” is 
 used in its true sense of inner, typical, sacred and 
 “logic,” as opposed to the external processioning of 
 physical events known as “historic,” and where the 
 term “mystic” is used as that which pertains to 
 initiation and the mysteries. </p>
 
 <p>The serious consideration of the matter contained in 
 these pages will, I hope, enable the attentive reader to 
 outline in his mind, however vaguely, some small 
 portion of the environment of infant Christianity, and 
 allow him to move a few steps round the cradle of 
 Christendom. </p>
 
 <p>Though the material that we have collected, has, as 
 to its externals, been tested, as far as our hands are 
 capable of the work, by the methods of scholarship and 
 criticism, it has nevertheless at the same time been 
 allowed ungrudgingly to show itself the outward </p>

 <p>expression of a truly vital endeavour of immense 
 interest and value to all who are disposed to make 
 friends with it. For along this ray of the Trismegistic 
 tradition we may allow ourselves to be drawn backwards in time towards the holy of holies of the 
 Wisdom of Ancient Egypt. The sympathetic study 
 of this material may well prove an initiatory process 
 towards an understanding of that Archaic Gnosis. </p>
 
 <p>And, therefore, though these volumes are intended to 
 show those competent to judge that all has been set 
 forth in decency according to approved methods of 
 modern research, they are also designed for those who 
 are not qualified to give an opinion on such matters, 
 but who are able to feel and think with the writers of 
 these beautiful tractates. </p>
