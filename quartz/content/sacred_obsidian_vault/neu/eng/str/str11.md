 <p align="center"><i>Of the </i>Cursus<i>. Games exercisd on holy festivals. The Druids understood geometry</i>.</p>  
 <p>ABOUT half a mile north of <i>Stonehenge</i>, across the first valley, is the <i>cursus</i> or <i>hippodrom</i>, which I discoverd august 6. 1723. Tis a noble monument of antiquity: and illustrates very much the preceding account of <i>Stonehenge</i>. It was the universal custom, to celebrate games, feasts, exercises and sports, at their more publick and solemn meetings to sacrifice. Which was done quarterly and anniversarily, at certain stated seasons of the year. <i>Macrob. Satur</i>. I. says, "Upon holy days dedicated to the gods, there are sacrifices, feasts, games and festivals. For a sacred solemnity is, when sacrifices are offerd to the gods, or holy feastings celebrated, or games performd to their honour, or when holy days are observd." This great work is included between two ditches running east and west in a parallel, which are 350 foot asunder. When I mention 350 foot, I speak in the gross, and as we should set it down in an <i>English</i> scale: but if we look into <i>Plate</i> <a href="str04.htm#img_pl06">VI.</a> where I have given a <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">TAB. VI.</font></span> comparative view of our <i>English</i> foot, and the most ancient cubit; at first sight we discern, this measure means 200 of the Druid cubits. This <i>cursus</i> is a little above l0000 foot long: that is, it is made of 6000 Druid cubits in length. A most noble work, contrivd to reach from the highest ground of two hills, extended the intermediate distance over a gentle valley: so that the whole cursus lies conveniently under the eye of the most numerous quantity of spectators. To render this more convenient for sight, it is projected on the side of rising ground, chiefly looking southward toward <i>Stonehenge</i>. A delightful prospect from the temple, when this vast plain was crouded with chariots, horsemen and foot, attending these solemnities, with innumerable multitudes! This <i>cursus</i>, which is two miles long, has two entrances (as it were:) gaps being left in the two little ditches. And these gaps, which are opposite to each other, in the two ditches, are opposite to the strait part of <i>Stonehenge</i> avenue.</p>  
 <p>I mentiond before, that at the bottom of the strait part of <i>Stonehenge</i> avenue, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">TAB XXVIII.</font></span>in the valley, the avenue divides itself into two parts. One goes directly east toward <i>Radfin</i>, the other goes northwestward, and enters our <i>cursus</i> nearly at the same distance west from the gaps or entrances before-mentiond: as those gaps are from the east end of the <i>hippodrom</i>. These gaps being at a convenient distance from that east end, may be thought to be in the nature of distance posts. It seems to me, that the turf of the adjacent ground on both sides, has been originally taken off, and laid on the whole length of this <i>cursus</i>, because it appears somewhat higher in level. Tho this was an incredible labour, yet a fine deign for the purpose of running. The earth of the <i>vallum</i> is likewise thrown inward.</p>  
 <p>The eat end of the <i>cursus</i> is composd of a huge body of earth, a bank or<span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">TAB. XXIX.</font></span> long barrow, thrown up nearly the whole breadth of the <i>cursus</i>. This seems to be the plain of session, for the judges of the prizes, and chief of the spectators. The west end of the <i>cursus</i> is curvd into an arch, like the end of the <i>Roman circus's</i>. And there probably the chariots ran round, in order to turn again. And there is an obscure barrow or two, round which they returnd, as it were, a <i>meta</i>.</p>  
 <p>This is the finest piece of ground that can be imagind for the purpose of a horse-race. The whole is commanded by the eye of a spectator in any part. In the middle is a valley, and pretty steep at present: yet only so, as that a</p>  
 <p><a name="page_42"><font size="1" color="green">p. 42</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> <i>British</i> charioteer may have a good opportunity of showing that dexterity, spoken of by <i>Cæsar</i>. But the exquisite softness of the turf prevents any great damage by a fall. The ground of it hereabouts declines somewhat northward. The main part of this <i>hippodrom</i> is upon a gentle ridge running east and west. This renderd the place cooler.</p>  
 <p>On the southern ridge, toward the west end of it, are many considerable barrows: but none towards the east end, for that would obstruct the view of <i>Stonehenge</i>. There are many barrows but of no considerable bulk, on the north-side, upon the extensive ascent, toward the great north long barrow. This magnificent work of the <i>cursus</i> is drawn due east and west: except a small variation of 4 or 5 degrees southward from the east. If we measure along the bank, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">TAB. XXIX.</font></span> from the eastern <i>meta</i>, at 700 cubits exactly, we come over against the middle line of the strait part of the avenue to <i>Stonehenge</i>: 500 cubits further conducts us to the gaps or opposite entrances, I before mentiond; which we suppose as distance posts. The whole interval between the eastern <i>meta</i> and these gaps, is 1200 cubits. At 1000 cubits more, we come to the place where the west wing of the avenue enters the southern ditch of the <i>cursus</i>. That west wing too, is just 1000 cubits long to its union, with the strait part of <i>Stonehenge</i> avenue. Likewise the strait part of <i>Stonehenge</i> avenue is just <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">TAB. XXVIII.</font></span> cubits long, as mentiond in its proper place. This west wing begins, in the bottom of that valley, which crosses the middle of the <i>cursus</i> and sweeping along by the bottom of the hill, in a gentle curve, meets with the lower end of the strait part of <i>Stonehenge</i> avenue, where the wing or avenue unites to it, with an equal angle. So that the whole work is laid out with great judgment and symmetry; and curiously adapted to the ground, which was well considerd, before the plot was markd out, by the first surveyors. From the bottom of the valley crossing the middle of the <i>cursus</i>, to the western <i>meta</i> is <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">TAB XXX.</font></span> 3800 cubits more, making in the whole 6000 cubits. The north end of the eastern <i>meta</i> does not extend so far as the northern bank of the <i>cursus:</i> I suppose, the reason is, that there might be liberty that way, to stop the horses, at the end of the course. Therefore they set out, on the south side of the <i>cursus</i> and returnd by the north side. I observe the ditch and bank towards the eastern end of the <i>cursus</i> much obscurd, by the trampling of men and horses, frequenting the spectators here: this being the most throngd.</p>  
 <p>The <i>Cursus</i> is directly north from <i>Stonehenge</i>: so exactly, that the meridian line of <i>Stonehenge</i> passes precisely thro the middle of the <i>Cursus</i>. And when we stand in the grand entrance of <i>Stonehenge</i> and observe the two extremities of the <i>Cursus</i> the eastern and western <i>meta</i>, they are each exactly 60 degrees from the meridian line; on each hand: making a third part of the circle of the horizon. By which we see, the Druids well understood the geometry of a circle, and its measure of 360 parts.</p>  
 <p><i>Pausanias</i> in <i>Beotic</i>. says, 'among the Thebans, by the gate <i>Prætis</i> is the <i>Gymnasium</i> of <i>Jolaus</i> and likewise the stadium, which is a bank of earth thrown up, such as that at <i>Olympia</i> and of the <i>Laurii</i>. In the same place is the heroical monument of <i>Jolaus</i>. A little beyond, to the right is the <i>hippodrom</i>, and in it <i>Pindar's</i> monument. The same author in <i>Arcad</i>. VIII. writes, that before the walls of <i>Mantinea</i>, in a field, was a stadium made for horse-races, in honour of <i>Antinous</i>. Not far from it was the temple of <i>Neptunus equestris</i> and others.' So that we see it was the manner of the ancient <i>Greeks</i> thus to define their places for sports by banks of earth, and that near their temples.</p>  
 <p>After the <i>Romans</i> had borrowd the use of the <i>British</i> chariots for travelling and the like, they usd them too in the <i>Circensian</i> games. Thus <i>Sidonius Apollinari</i>s his poem upon it, <i>Lib</i>. XXII.</p>

 <p>Again,</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><i>Tunc ctus juvenum sed aulicorum<br> Eli simulachra torva Carapi<br> Exercent, spatiantibus quadrigis.<br> ------tandem murmura buccinæ strepentis<br> Suspensas tubicen vocans quadrigis,<br> Effundit celeres in arva currus.<br> Hinc agger sonat, hinc Arar resultat,<br> Hinc se se pedes atque eques reflectit,<br> Stridentum &amp; moderator essedorum</i>.</div>  
 <p>Such, we may well imagine, was the scene of this place, in ancient days. And as the poet mentions the river <i>Arar</i>, I may take notice, in passing, that I have seen, several other places of sports and racings, which I take to have belong'd to the ancient <i>Britons</i>. As particularly those two great banks calld <i>Rawdikes</i> in the meadow near <i>Leicester</i>, which spectators look on as unaccountable. Another such work, I have seen in the meadow by <i>Dorchester</i>, the ancient <i>Roman</i> city and episcopal see, in <i>Oxfordshire</i>. Both are by the side of rivers. Another upon the river <i>Lowther</i> by <i>Perith</i> in <i>Cumberland</i>.</p>  
 <p>These places by rivers, were more agreeable to the <i>Greek</i> taste, as in a hotter country. Another like place of sports, was in the chalky valley just without the town of <i>Royston</i>, on the south side of it, by the <i>London</i> road. The old <i>Roman</i> road there, or <i>Hermen-street</i> passes over one corner of the work, as being of later date. I may, perhaps, describe these more largely, another time. We read in <i>Homer</i> and <i>Virgil</i> that races were celebrated at funerals.</p>
