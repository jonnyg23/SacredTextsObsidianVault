 <p>There was an old woman, as I've heard tell,<br>
 She went to the market her eggs for to sell;<br>
 She went to the market, all on a market-day,<br>
 And she fell asleep on the king's highway.</p>
 <p>There came by a pedlar, whose name was Stout,<br>
 He cut her petticoats round about;<br>
 He cut her petticoats up to the knees,<br>
 Which made the old woman to shiver and freeze.</p>
 <p>When this old woman first did wake,<br>
 She began to shiver, and she began to shake;<br>
 She began to wonder, and she began to cry --<br>
 'Lawkamercyme, this is none of I!</p>
 <p>'But if it bet, as I do hope it be,<br>
 I've a little dog at home, and he'll know me;<br>
 If it be I, he'll wag his little tail,<br>
 And if it be not I, he'll loudly bark and wail.'</p>
 <p>Home went the little woman, all in the dark;<br>
 Up got the little dog, and he began to bark;<br>
 He began to bark, so she began to cry --<br>
 'Lawkamercyme, this is none of I !'</p>
