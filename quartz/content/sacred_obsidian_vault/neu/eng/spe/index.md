 <p>This book is a key source for information on leisure time activities
 in 'Olde England,' including sports, hunting, games,
 dancing, gymnastics, music, festivals including Christmas and May Day
 and customs such as Mumming, The Boy Bishop, and The Lord of Misrule.
 It answers questions such as "How do you score a joust?,"
 (<a href="spe11.htm#page_125">p. 125</a>)
 "When did feral wolves become extinct in Britain?,"
 (<a href="spe05.htm#page_12">p. 12</a>)
 and "How much <i>do</i> you pay the piper?"
 (<a href="spe13.htm#page_164">p. 164</a>)
 And what is Shakespeare talking about when
 he mentions Shove-Groat (<a href="spe18.htm#page_242">p. 242</a>)
 or Nine Men's Morris (<a href="spe19.htm#page_256">p. 256</a>)?
 (The modern equivalents are shuffleboard and tic-tac-toe).
 Included are numerous quotes from original documents and dozens of
 plates based on period illustrations.</p>
 <p>
 Strutt documents the constant conflict between popular culture and
 the religious and secular powers.
 The 'culture war' has been going on long before modern attempts to censor
 videos, computer games and comic books.
 In 1579, under Queen Elizabeth, a Puritan writer (John Northbrooke)
 branded playing cards "an invention of the devill"
 (<a href="spe19.htm#page_261">p. 261</a>), and 
 complained (<a href="spe12.htm#page_138">p. 138</a>)
 "Many can tary at a vayne
 Playe for two or three hours, when as they will not abide scarce one houre
 at a Sermon."
 There was a class element to this as well, with an open double standard.
 In 1541, a statute forbade the lower classes from bowling
 and other games except under certain closely supervised circumstances;
 however, nobles could obtain a license to bowl on their own land
 (<a href="spe17.htm#page_217">p. 217</a>).
 Likewise, football (<a href="spe10.htm#page_96">p. 96</a>)
 and tennis (<a href="spe10.htm#page_85">p. 85</a>) were at times
 forbidden to everyone--except the upper class.

 Production notes: Since English spelling was still in a state of flux when
 this book was originally published in 1801, and the book quotes from many
 older documents, spelling varies widely in the body of the text. I have
 left these spellings intact.
 The asterisks which appear in front of many of the paragraphs were in the
 original book and do not indicate footnotes; rather,
 they indicate material added in the second edition.
