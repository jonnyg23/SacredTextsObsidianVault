 <h1 align="CENTER">Helen of Kirkconnell</h1>
 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>I WAD I were where Helen lies;<br>
 Night and day on me she cries;<br>
 O that I were where Helen lies,<br>
   On fair Kirkconnell lea!</p>
 <p>Curst be the heart that thought the thought,<br>
 And curst the hand that fired the shot,<br>
 When in my arms burd Helen dropt,<br>
   And died to succour me!</p>
 <p>O think na but my heart was sair<br>
 When my Love dropt and spak nae mair!<br>
 I laid her down wi' meikle care,<br>
   On fair Kirkconnell lea.</p>
 <p><a name="page_98"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 98</font></a></p>
 <p>As I went down the water side,<br>
 Nane but my foe to be my guide,<br>
 Nane but my foe to be my guide,<br>
   On fair Kirkconnell lea.</p>
 <p>I lighted down my sword to draw,<br>
 I hackéd him in pieces sma',<br>
 I hackéd him in pieces sma',<br>
   For her sake that died for me.</p>
 <p>O Helen fair, beyond compare!<br>
 I'll make a garland of thy hair,<br>
 Shall bind my heart for evermair,<br>
   Until the day I dee!</p>
 <p>O that I were where Helen lies<br>
 Night and day on me she cries;<br>
 Out of my bed she bids me rise,<br>
   Says, "Haste, and come to me!"</p>
 <p>O Helen fair! O Helen chaste!<br>
 If I were with thee, I were blest,<br>
 Where thou lies low and takes thy rest,<br>
   On fair Kirkconnell lea.</p>
 <p><a name="page_99"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 99</font></a></p>
 <p>I wad my grave were growing green,<br>
 A winding-sheet drawn ower my een,<br>
 And I in Helen's arms lying,<br>
   On fair Kirkconnell lea.</p>
 <p>I wad I were where Helen lies!<br>
 Night and day on me she cries,<br>
 And I am weary of the skies,<br>
   Since my Love died for me.</p>
