 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>KING JAMIE hath made a vow,<br>
   Keepe it well if he may:<br>
 That he will be at lovely London<br>
   Upon Saint James his day.</p>
 <p>Upon Saint James his day at noone,<br>
   At faire London will I be,<br>
 And all the lords in merrie Scotland,<br>
   They shall dine there with me.</p>
 <p>"March out, march out, my merry men,<br>
   Of hie or low degree;<br>
 I'le weare the crowne in London towne,<br>
   And that you soon shall be."</p>

 <p>Then bespake good Queene Margaret,<br>
   The teares fell from her eye:<br>
 "Leave off these warres, most noble King,<br>
   Keepe your fidelitie.</p>
 <p>"The water runnes swift, and wondrous deepe,<br>
   From bottome unto the brimme;<br>
 My brother Henry hath men good enough;<br>
   England is hard to winne."</p>
 <p>"Away" quoth he "with this silly foole!<br>
   In prison fast let her lie:<br>
 For she is come of the English bloud,<br>
   And for these words she shall dye."</p>
 <p>With that bespake Lord Thomas Howard,<br>
   The Queenes chamberlaine that day:<br>
 If that you put Queene Margaret to death,<br>
   Scotland shall rue it alway."</p>
 <p>Then in a rage King Jamie did say,<br>
   "Away with this foolish mome;<br>
 He shall be hanged, and the other be burned,<br>
   So soone as I come home."</p>

 <p>At Flodden Field the Scots came in,<br>
   Which made our English men faine;<br>
 At Bramstone Greene this battaile was seene,<br>
   There was King Jamie slaine.</p>
 <p>His bodie never could be found,<br>
   When he was over throwne,<br>
 And he that wore faire Scotland's crowne<br>
   That day could not be knowne.</p>
 <p>Then presently the Scot did flie,<br>
   Their cannons they left behind;<br>
 Their ensignes gay were won all away,<br>
   Our souldiers did beate them blinde.</p>
 <p>To tell you plaine, twelve thousand were slaine,<br>
   That to the fight did stand,<br>
 And many prisoners tooke that day,<br>
   The best in all Scotland.</p>
 <p>That day made many [a] fatherlesse child,<br>
   And many a widow poore,<br>
 And many a Scottish gay lady<br>
   Sate weeping in her bower.</p>

 <p>Jack with a feather was lapt all in leather,<br>
   His boastings were all in vaine;<br>
 He had such a chance, with a new morrice-dance<br>
   He never went home againe.</p>

 <p>Now heaven we laude that never more<br>
   Such biding shall come to hand;<br>
 Our King, by othe, is King of both<br>
   England and faire Scotland.</p>
