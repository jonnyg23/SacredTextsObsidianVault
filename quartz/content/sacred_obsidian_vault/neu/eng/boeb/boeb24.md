 <h1 align="CENTER">The Battle of Otterburn</h1>
 <h3 align="CENTER">THE FIRST FYTTE</h3>
 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>IT fell about the Lammas tide,<br>
   When husbands winn their hay,<br>
 The doughty Douglas bound him to ride<br>
   Into England to take a prey.</p>
 <p>The Earl of Fife, withouten strife,<br>
   He bound him over Solway;<br>
 The great would ever together ride<br>
   That race they may rue for aye.</p>
 <p>Over Ottercap hill they came in,<br>
   And so down by Rotheley crag,<br>
 Upon Green Leighton they lighted down,<br>
   Styrande many a stag;</p>
 <p><a name="page_155"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 155</font></a></p>
 <p>And boldly brente Northumberland,<br>
   And harried many a town;<br>
 They did our Englishmen great wrong<br>
   To battle that were not bown.</p>
 <p>Then spake a berne upon the bent,<br>
   Of comfort that was not cold,<br>
 And said, "We have brente Northumberland,<br>
   We have all wealth in holde.</p>
 <p>"Now we have harried all Bamborough shire<br>
   All the wealth in the world have we;<br>
 I rede we ride to Newcastle,<br>
   So still and stalworthlye."</p>
 <p>Upon the morrow, when it was day,<br>
   The standards shone full bright;<br>
 To the Newcastle they took the way,<br>
   And thither they came full right.</p>
 <p>Sir Henry Percy lay at the Newcastle,<br>
   I tell you, withouten dread;<br>
 He has been a March-man all his days,<br>
   And kept Berwick upon Tweed.</p>
 <p><a name="page_156"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 156</font></a></p>
 <p>To the Newcastle when they came,<br>
   The Scots they cried on hyght:<br>
 "Sir Harry Percy, an thou bist within,<br>
   Come to the field and fight:</p>
 <p>"For we have brente Northumberland,<br>
   Thy heritage good and right;<br>
 And syne my lodging I have take,<br>
   With my brand dubbed many a knight."</p>
 <p>Sir Harry Percy came to the walls,<br>
   The Scottish host for to see:<br>
 "And thou hast brente Northumberland,<br>
   Full sore it rueth me.</p>
 <p>"If thou hast harried all Bamborough shire,<br>
   Thou hast done me great envy;<br>
 For the trespàss thou hast me done,<br>
   The one of us shall die."</p>
 <p>"Where shall I bide thee?" said the Douglas;<br>
   "Or where wilt thou come to me?<br>
 "At Otterburn in the high way,<br>
   There mayst thou well lodged be.</p>
 <p><a name="page_157"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 157</font></a></p>
 <p>The roe full reckless there she runs,<br>
   To make thee game and glee;<br>
 The falcon and the pheasant both,<br>
   Among the holtes on hee.</p>
 <p>"There mayst thou have thy wealth at will,<br>
   Well lodged there mayst thou be;<br>
 It shall not be long ere I come thee till,"<br>
   Said Sir Harry Percyè.</p>
 <p>There shall I bide thee," said the Douglas,<br>
   "By the faith of my bodỳ."<br>
 "Thither shall I come," said Sir Harry Percỳ,<br>
   "My troth I plight to thee."</p>
 <p>A pipe of wine he gave them over the walls,<br>
   For sooth, as I you say;<br>
 There he made the Douglas drink,<br>
   And all his host that day.</p>
 <p>The Douglas turned him homeward again,<br>
   For sooth withouten nay;<br>
 He took his lodging at Otterburn<br>
   Upon a Wednèsday;</p>
 <p><a name="page_158"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 158</font></a></p>
 <p>And there he pyght his standard down.<br>
   His getting more and less;<br>
 And syne he warned his men to go<br>
   And get their geldings gress.</p>
 <p>A Scottish knight hoved upon the bent,<br>
   A watch I dare well say;<br>
 So was he ware on the noble Percỳ<br>
   In the dawning of the day.</p>
 <p>He pricked to his pavilion door,<br>
   As fast as he might ronne;<br>
 "Awaken, Douglas!" cried the knight,<br>
   "For His love that sits in throne.</p>
 <p>"Awaken, Douglas!" cried the knight,<br>
   "For thou mayst waken with wynne;<br>
 Yonder have I spied the proud Percỳ,<br>
   And seven standàrds with him."</p>
 <p>Nay, by my troth," the Douglas said,<br>
   "It is but a feignèd tale;<br>
 He durst not look on my broad bannèr,<br>
   For all Englànd so hayle</p>
 <p><a name="page_159"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 159</font></a></p>
 <p>"Was I not yesterday at the Newcastle,<br>
   That stands so fair on Tyne?<br>
 For all the men the Percy had,<br>
   He could not garre me once to dyne."</p>
 <p>He stepped out at his pavilion door,<br>
   To look, and it were less;<br>
 "Array you, lordyngs, one and all,<br>
   For here begins no peace.</p>
 <p>"The Earl of Menteith, thou art my eme,<br>
   The forward I give to thee;<br>
 The Earl of Huntley cawte and keen,<br>
   He shall with thee be.</p>
 <p>"The Lord of Buchan, in armour bright,<br>
   On the other hand he shall be;<br>
 Lord Johnstone, and Lord Maxwell,<br>
   They two shall be with me.</p>
 <p>"Swynton fair field upon your pride<br>
   To battle make you bowen;<br>
 Sir Davy Scot, Sir Walter Steward,<br>
   Sir John of Agerstone."</p>

 </font><h3 align="CENTER">THE SECOND FYTTE</h3>
 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>The Percy came before his host,<br>
   Which ever was a gentle knight,<br>
 Upon the Douglas loud did he cry,<br>
   "I will hold that I have hight;</p>
 <p>"For thou hast brente Northumberland,<br>
   And done me great envỳ;<br>
 For this trespàss thou hast me done<br>
   The one of us shall die."</p>
 <p>The Douglas answered him again,<br>
   With great words up on hee,<br>
 And said, "I have twenty against thy one,<br>
   Behold, and thou mayst see."</p>
 <p>With that the Percy was grievèd sore,<br>
   For sooth as I you say;<br>
 He lighted down upon his foot,<br>
   And shot his horse clean away</p>
 <p><a name="page_161"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 161</font></a></p>
 <p>Every man saw that he did so,<br>
   That ryall was ever in rout;<br>
 Every man shot his horse him fro,<br>
   And light him round about.</p>
 <p>Thus Sir Harry Percy took the field,<br>
   For sooth as I you say,<br>
 Jesu Christ in heaven on high,<br>
   Did help him well that day.</p>
 <p>But nine thousand, there was no more,<br>
   If chronicle will not layne;<br>
 Forty thousand Scots and four<br>
   That day fought them again,</p>
 <p>But when the battle began to join,<br>
   In haste there came a knight,<br>
 Then letters fair forth hath he ta'en,<br>
   And thus he said full right:</p>
 <p>"My lord, your father he greets you well,<br>
   With many a noble knight;<br>
 He desires you to bide,<br>
   That he may see this fight.</p>
 <p><a name="page_162"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 162</font></a></p>
 <p>"The baron of Grastock is come out of the west,<br>
   With him a noble company;<br>
 All they lodge at your father's this night,<br>
   And the battle fain would they see."</p>
 <p>For Jesu's love," said Sir Harry Percỳ,<br>
   "That died for you and me,<br>
 Wend to my lord, my father, again,<br>
   And say thou saw me not with ee;</p>
 <p>"My troth is plight to yon Scottish knight,<br>
   It needs me not to layne,<br>
 That I should bide him upon this bent,<br>
   And I have his troth again;</p>
 <p>"And if that I wend off this ground,<br>
   For sooth unfoughten away,<br>
 He would me call but a coward knight,<br>
   In his land another day.</p>
 <p>"Yet had I lever to be rynde and rent,<br>
   By Mary that mykel may,<br>
 Than ever my manhood should be reproved<br>
   With a Scot another day.</p>
 <p><a name="page_163"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 163</font></a></p>
 <p>"Wherefore shoot, archers, for my sake,<br>
   And let sharp arrows flee;<br>
 Minstrels, play up for your warison,<br>
   And well quit it shall be.</p>
 <p>"Every man think on his true love,<br>
   And mark him to the Trinitỳ;<br>
 For to God I make mine a-vow<br>
   This day will I not flee."</p>
 <p>The bloody heart in the Douglas' arms,<br>
   His standard stood on high,<br>
 That every man might full well know;<br>
   Beside stood starrès three.</p>
 <p>The white Liòn on the English part,<br>
   For sooth as I you sayne,<br>
 The luces and the crescents both<br>
   The Scots fought them again.</p>
 <p>Upon Saint Andrew loud did they cry,<br>
   And thrice they shout on hyght,<br>
 And syne marked them on our Englishmen,<br>
   As I have told you right.</p>
 <p><a name="page_164"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 164</font></a></p>
 <p>Saint George the bright, our Lady's knight,<br>
   To name they were full fain,<br>
 Our Englishmen they cried on hyght,<br>
   And thrice they shout again.</p>
 <p>With that sharp arrows began to flee,<br>
   I tell you in certain;<br>
 Men of arms began to join;<br>
   Many a doughty man was there slain.</p>
 <p>The Percy and the Douglas met,<br>
   That either of them was fain;<br>
 They schapped together, while that they sweat,<br>
   With swords of fine Collayne;</p>
 <p>Till the blood from their basenets ran<br>
   As the roke doth in the rain.<br>
 "Yield thee to me," said the Douglas,<br>
   "Or else thou shalt be slain;</p>
 <p>"For I see by thy bright basenet,<br>
   Thou art some man of might;<br>
 And so I do by thy burnished brand,<br>
   Thou art an earl, or else a knight."</p>
 <p><a name="page_165"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 165</font></a></p>
 <p>"By my good faith," said the noble Percỳ,<br>
   "Now hast thou rede full right;<br>
 Yet will I never yield me to thee,<br>
   While I may stand and fight."</p>
 <p>They swapped together, while that they sweat,<br>
   With swordès sharp and long;<br>
 Each on other so fast they beat,<br>
   Till their helms came in pieces down.</p>
 <p>The Percy was a man of strength,<br>
   I tell you in this stound<br>
 He smote the Douglas at the sword's length,<br>
   That he felled him to the ground.</p>
 <p>The sword was sharp, and sore did byte,<br>
   I tell you in certàin;<br>
 To the heart he did him smite,<br>
   Thus was the Douglas slain.</p>
 <p>The standards stood still on each side;<br>
   With many a grievous groan,<br>
 There they fought the day, and all the night,<br>
   And many a doughty man was slone.</p>
 <p><a name="page_166"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 166</font></a></p>
 <p>There was no freyke that there would fly,<br>
   But stiffly in stour did stand,<br>
 Echone hewing on other while they might dry,<br>
   With many a baleful brand.</p>
 <p>There was slain upon the Scottes side,<br>
   For sooth and certainlỳ,<br>
 Sir James of Douglas there was slain,<br>
   That day that he did die.</p>
 <p>The Earl of Menteith he was slain.<br>
   Grysely groaned upon the ground;<br>
 Sir Davy Scot, Sir Walter Steward,<br>
   Sir John of Agerstone.</p>
 <p>Sir Charles Murray in that place,<br>
   That never a foot would fly;<br>
 Sir Hugh Maxwèll, a lord he was,<br>
   With the Douglas did he die.</p>
 <p>There was slain upon the Scottes side,<br>
   For sooth as I you say,<br>
 Of four and forty thousand Scots,<br>
   Went but eighteen away.</p>
 <p><a name="page_167"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 167</font></a></p>

 <p> </p>
 <p>There was slain upon the English side,<br>
   For sooth and certainlỳ,<br>
 A gentle knight, Sir John Fitzhugh,<br>
   It was the more pitỳ.</p>
 <p>Sir James Harebotell there was slain,<br>
   For him their hearts were sore<br>
 The gentle Lovel there was slain,<br>
   That the Percy's standard bore.</p>
 <p>There was slain upon the English side,<br>
   For sooth as I you say,<br>
 Of nine thousand Englishmen,<br>
   Five hundred came away;</p>
 <p>The others were slaynè in the field,<br>
   Christ keep their souls from woe,<br>
 Seeing there were so few friends<br>
   Against so many a foe!</p>
 <p>Then on the morn they made them biers<br>
   Of birch and hazel gray;<br>
 Many a widow with weeping tears<br>
   Their makes they fetch away.</p>
 <p><a name="page_168"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 168</font></a></p>
 <p>This fray began at Otterburn,<br>
   Between the night and the day;<br>
 There the Douglas lost his life,<br>
   And the Percy was led away.</p>
 <p>Then was there a Scottish prisoner ta'en,<br>
   Sir Hugh Montgomery was his name,<br>
 For sooth as I you say,<br>
   He borrowed the Percy home again.</p>
 <p>Now let us all for the Percy pray,<br>
   To Jesu most of might,<br>
 To bring his soul to the bliss of heaven,<br>
   For he was a gentle knight.</p>
