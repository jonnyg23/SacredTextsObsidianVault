 <h1 align="CENTER">Young Waters</h1>
 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>ABOUT Yule, when the wind blew cool;<br>
   And the round tables began,<br>
 A' there is come to our king's court<br>
   Mony a well-favoured man.</p>
 <p>The queen looked o'er the castle wa',<br>
   Beheld baith dale and down,<br>
 And then she saw young Waters<br>
   Come riding to the town.</p>
 <p>His footmen they did rin before,<br>
   His horsemen rade behind;<br>
 Ane mantle of the burning gowd<br>
   Did keep him frae the wind.</p>

 <p>Gowden graith'd <a name="fr_0"></a><a href="#fn_0"><font size="1">1</font></a> his horse before,<br>
   And siller shod behind;<br>
 The horse young Waters rade upon<br>
   Was fleeter than the wind.</p>
 <p>Out then spake a wily lord,<br>
   Unto the queen said he:<br>
 "O tell me wha's the fairest face<br>
   Rides in the company?"</p>
 <p>"I've seen lord, and I've seen laird,<br>
   And knights of high degree,<br>
 But a fairer face than young Waters<br>
   Mine eyen did never see."</p>
 <p>Out then spake the jealous king<br>
   And an angry man was he:<br>
 "O if he had been twice as fair,<br>
   You might have excepted me."</p>
 <p>"You're neither laird nor lord," she says,<br>
   "But the king that wears the crown;<br>
 There is not a knight in fair Scotland,<br>
   But to thee maun bow down."</p>
 <p>

 <p>For a' that she could do or say,<br>
   Appeased he wad nae be;<br>
 But for the words which she had said,<br>
   Young Waters he maun dee.</p>
 <p>They hae ta'en young Waters,<br>
   And put fetters to his feet;<br>
 They hae ta'en young Waters,<br>
   And thrown him in dungeon deep.</p>
 <p>"Aft I have ridden thro' Stirling town,<br>
   In the wind but and the weet;<br>
 But I ne'er rade thro' Stirling town<br>
   Wi' fetters at my feet.</p>
 <p>"Aft have I ridden thro' Stirling town,<br>
   In the wind but and the rain;<br>
 But I ne'er rade thro' Stirling town<br>
   Ne'er to return again."</p>
 <p>They hae ta'en to the heading-hill<br>
   His young son in his cradle;<br>
 And they hae ta'en to the heading-hill<br>
   His horse but and his saddle.</p>

 <p>They hae ta'en to the heading-hill<br>
 His lady fair to see;<br>
 And for the words the queen had spoke<br>
 Young Waters he did dee.</p>
