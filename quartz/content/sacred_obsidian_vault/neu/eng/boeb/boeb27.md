 <h3 align="CENTER">SHOWING THE CRUELTY OF A JEW'S DAUGHTER</h3>
 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>FOUR and twenty bonny boys<br>
   Were playing at the ba',<br>
 And up it stands him sweet Sir Hugh,<br>
   The flower among them a'.</p>
 <p>He kicked the ba' there wi' his foot,<br>
   And keppit it wi' his knee,<br>
 Till even in at the Jew's window<br>
   He gart the bonny ba' flee.</p>
 <p>"Cast out the ba' to me, fair maid,<br>
   Cast out the ba' to me."<br>
 "Never a bit," says the Jew's daughter,<br>
   Till ye come up to me."</p>

 <p>"Come up, sweet Hugh, come up, dear Hugh,<br>
   Come up and get the ba'."<br>
 "I winna come, I mayna come,<br>
   Without my bonny boys a'."</p>
 <p>She's ta'en her to the Jew's garden,<br>
   Where the grass grew lang and green,<br>
 She's pu'd an apple red and white,<br>
   To wyle the bonny boy in.</p>
 <p>She's wyled him in through ae chamber,<br>
   She's wyled him in through twa,<br>
 She's wyled him into the third chamber,<br>
   And that was the warst o' a'.</p>
 <p>She's tied the little boy, hands and feet,<br>
   She's pierced him wi' a knife,<br>
 She's caught his heart's blood in a golden cup,<br>
   And twinn'd him o' his life.</p>
 <p>She row'd him in a cake o' lead,<br>
   Bade him lie still and sleep,<br>
 She cast him in a deep draw-well<br>
   Was fifty fathom deep.</p>
 <p><a name="page_178"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 178</font></a></p>
 <p>When bells were rung, and mass was sung,<br>
   And every bairn went hame,<br>
 Then ilka lady had her young son,<br>
   But Lady Helen had nane.</p>
 <p>She row'd her mantle her about,<br>
   And sair, sair 'gan she weep;<br>
 And she ran unto the Jew's house,<br>
   When they were all asleep.</p>
 <p>"My bonny Sir Hugh, my pretty Sir Hugh,<br>
   I pray thee to me speak!"<br>
 "Lady Helen, come to the deep draw-well<br>
   'Gin ye your son wad seek."</p>
 <p>Lady Helen ran to the deep draw-well,<br>
   And knelt upon her knee:<br>
 "My bonny Sir Hugh, an ye be here,<br>
   I pray thee speak to me!"</p>
 <p>"The lead is wondrous heavy, mither,<br>
   The well is wondrous deep;<br>
 A keen penknife sticks in my heart,<br>
   It is hard for me to speak.</p>
 <p><a name="page_179"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 179</font></a></p>
 <p>"Gae hame, gae hame, my mither dear,<br>
   Fetch me my winding-sheet;<br>
 And at the back o' merry Lincoln,<br>
   It's there we twa sall meet."</p>
 <p>Now Lady Helen she's gane hame,<br>
   Made him a winding-sheet;<br>
 And at the back o' merry Lincoln,<br>
   The dead corpse did her meet.</p>
 <p>And a' the bells o' merry Lincoln<br>
   Without men's hands were rung;<br>
 And a' the books o' merry Lincoln<br>
   Were read without men's tongue:<br>
 Never was such a burial<br>
   Sin' Adam's days begun.</p>
