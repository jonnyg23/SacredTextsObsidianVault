 <h1 align="CENTER">Robin Hood's Death and Burial</h1>
 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>WHEN Robin Hood and Little John<br>
     <i>Down a down, a down, a down</i>,<br>
   Went o'er yon bank of broom,<br>
 Said Robin Hood to Little John,<br>
   "We have shot for many a pound:<br>
   <i>Hey down, a down, a down</i>.</p>
 <p>"But I am not able to shoot one shot more,<br>
   My arrows will not flee;<br>
 But I have a cousin lives down below,<br>
   Please God, she will bleed me."</p>
 <p>Now Robin is to fair Kirkley gone,<br>
   As fast as he can win; <a name="page_120"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 120</font></a><br>
 But before he came there, as we do hear,<br>
   He was taken very ill.</p>
 <p>And when that he came to fair Kirkley-hall,<br>
   He knocked all at the ring,<br>
 But none was so ready as his cousin herself<br>
   For to let bold Robin in.</p>
 <p>"Will you please to sit down, cousin Robin," she said,<br>
   "And drink some beer with me?<br>
 "No, I will neither eat nor drink,<br>
   Till I am blooded by thee."</p>
 <p>"Well, I have a room, cousin Robin," she said,<br>
   "Which you did never see;<br>
 And if you please to walk therein,<br>
   You blooded by me shall be."</p>
 <p>She took him by the lily-white hand,<br>
   And led him to a private room;<br>
 And there she blooded bold Robin Hood,<br>
   Whilst one drop of blood would run.</p>
 <p><a name="page_120"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 120</font></a></p>
 <p>She blooded him in the vein of the arm,<br>
   And locked him up in the room;<br>
 There did he bleed all the live-long day,<br>
   Until the next day at noon.</p>
 <p>He then bethought him of a casement door,<br>
   Thinking for to begone;<br>
 He was so weak he could not leap,<br>
   Nor he could not get down.</p>
 <p>He then bethought him of his bugle-horn,<br>
   Which hung low down to his knee,<br>
 He set his horn unto his mouth,<br>
   And blew out weak blasts three.</p>
 <p>Then Little John, when hearing him,<br>
   As he sat under the tree,<br>
 I fear my master is near dead,<br>
   He blows so wearily."</p>
 <p>Then Little John to Fair Kirkley is gone,<br>
   As fast as he can dree;<br>
 But when he came to Kirkley-hall,<br>
   He broke locks two or three;</p>
 <p><a name="page_122"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 122</font></a></p>
 <p>Until he came bold Robin to,<br>
   Then he fell on his knee;<br>
 "A boon, a boon," cries Little John,<br>
   "Master, I beg of thee."</p>
 <p>"What is that boon," quoth Robin Hood,<br>
   "Little John, thou begst of me?"<br>
 "It is to burn fair Kirkley-hall,<br>
   And all their nunnery."</p>
 <p>"Now nay, now nay," quoth Robin Hood,<br>
   "That boon I'll not grant thee;<br>
 I never hurt woman in all my life,<br>
   Nor man in woman's company.</p>
 <p>"I never hurt fair maid in all my time,<br>
   Nor at my end shall it be;<br>
 But give me my bent bow in my hand,<br>
   And a broad arrow I'll let flee;<br>
 And where this arrow is taken up,<br>
   There shall my grave diggèd be.</p>

 <p> </p>
 <p>"Lay me a green sod under my head,<br>
   And another under my feet; <a name="page_122"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 122</font></a><br>
 And lay my bent bow by my side,<br>
   Which was my music sweet;<br>
 And make my grave of gravel and green,<br>
   Which is most right and meet.</p>
 <p>"Let me have length and breadth enough,<br>
   With a green sod under my head;<br>
 That they may say when I am dead,<br>
   Here lies bold Robin Hood."</p>
 <p>These words they readily promised him,<br>
   Which did bold Robin please;<br>
 And there they buried bold Robin Hood,<br>
   Near to the fair Kirklèys.</p>
