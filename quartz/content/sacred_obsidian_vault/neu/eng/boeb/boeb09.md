 <h1 align="CENTER">Annan Water</h1>
 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>"ANNAN Water's wading deep,<br>
   And my love Annie's wondrous bonny;<br>
 I will keep my tryst to-night,<br>
   And win the heart o' lovely Annie."</p>
 <p>He's loupen on his bonny grey,<br>
   He rade the right gate and the ready',<br>
 For a' the storm he wadna stay,<br>
   For seeking o' his bonny lady.</p>
 <p>And he has ridden o'er field and fell,<br>
   Through muir and moss, and stones and mire;<br>
 His spurs o' steel were sair to bide,<br>
   And frae her four feet flew the fire.</p>
 <p><a name="page_77"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 77</font></a></p>
 <p>"My bonny grey, noo play your part!<br>
   Gin ye be the steed that wins my dearie,<br>
 Wi' corn and hay ye'se be fed for aye,<br>
   And never spur sail mak' you wearie."</p>
 <p>The grey was a mare, and a right gude mare:<br>
   But when she wan the Annan Water,<br>
 She couldna hae found the ford that night<br>
   Had a thousand merks been wadded at her.</p>
 <p>"O boatman, boatman, put off your boat,<br>
   Put off your boat for gouden money!"<br>
 But for a' the goud in fair Scotland,<br>
   He dared na tak' him through to Annie.</p>
 <p>"O I was sworn sae late yestreen,<br>
   Not by a single aith, but mony.<br>
 I'll cross the drumly stream to-night,<br>
   Or never could I face my honey."</p>
 <p>The side was stey, and the bottom deep,<br>
   Frae bank to brae the water pouring;<br>
 The bonny grey mare she swat for fear,<br>
   For she heard the water-kelpy roaring.</p>
 <p><a name="page_78"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 78</font></a></p>
 <p>He spurred her forth into the flood,<br>
   I wot she swam both strong and steady;<br>
 But the stream was broad, her strength did fail,<br>
   And he never saw his bonny lady.</p>
 <p>O wae betide the frush saugh wand!<br>
   And wae betide the bush of brier!<br>
 That bent and brake into his hand,<br>
   When strength of man and horse did tire.</p>
 <p>And wae betide ye, Annan Water!<br>
   This night ye are a drumly river;<br>
 But over thee we'll build a brig,<br>
   That ye nae mair true love may sever.</p>
