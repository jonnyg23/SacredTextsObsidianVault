 <h1 align="CENTER">Fair Rosamond</h1>
 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>WHEN as King Henry rulde this land,<br>
   The second of that name,<br>
 Besides the queene, he dearly lovde<br>
   A faire and comely dame.</p>
 <p>Most peerlesse was her beautye founde,<br>
   Her favour, and her face;<br>
 A sweeter creature in this worlde<br>
   Could never prince embrace.</p>
 <p>Her crisped lockes like threads of golde,<br>
   Appeard to each man's sight;<br>
 Her sparkling eyes, like Orient pearles,<br>
   Did cast a heavenlye light.</p>
 <p><a name="page_60"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 60</font></a></p>
 <p>The blood within her crystal cheekes<br>
   Did such a colour drive,<br>
 As though the lillye and the rose<br>
   For mastership did strive.</p>
 <p>Yea Rosamonde, fair Rosamonde,<br>
   Her name was called so,<br>
 To whom our queene, Dame Ellinor,<br>
   Was known a deadlye foe.</p>
 <p>The king therefore, for her defence<br>
   Against the furious queene,<br>
 At Woodstocke builded such a bower,<br>
   The like was never seene.</p>
 <p>Most curiously that bower was built,<br>
   Of stone and timber strong;<br>
 An hundered and fifty doors<br>
   Did to this bower belong:</p>
 <p>And they so cunninglye contriv'd,<br>
   With turnings round about,<br>
 That none but with a clue of thread<br>
   Could enter in or out.</p>
 <p><a name="page_61"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 61</font></a></p>
 <p>And for his love and ladyes sake,<br>
   That was so faire and brighte,<br>
 The keeping of this bower he gave<br>
   Unto a valiant knighte.</p>
 <p>But fortune, that doth often frowne<br>
   Where she before did smile,<br>
 The kinges delighte and ladyes joy<br>
   Full soon shee did beguile:</p>
 <p>For why, the kinges ungracious sonne,<br>
   Whom he did high advance,<br>
 Against his father raised warres<br>
   Within the realme of France.</p>
 <p>But yet before our comelye king<br>
   The English land forsooke,<br>
 Of Rosamond, his lady faire,<br>
   His farewelle thus he tooke:</p>
 <p>My Rosamonde, my only Rose,<br>
   That pleasest best mine eye,<br>
 The fairest flower in all the worlde<br>
   To feed my fantasye,--</p>
 <p><a name="page_62"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 62</font></a></p>
 <p>"The flower of mine affected heart,<br>
   Whose sweetness doth excelle,<br>
 My royal Rose, a thousand times<br>
   I bid thee nowe farwelle!</p>
 <p>For I must leave my fairest flower,<br>
   My sweetest Rose, a space,<br>
 And cross the seas to famous France.,<br>
   Proud rebelles to abase.</p>
 <p>But yet, my Rose, be sure thou shalt<br>
   My coming shortlye see,<br>
 And in my heart, when hence I am,<br>
   Ile beare my Rose with mee."</p>
 <p>When Rosamond, that ladye brighte,<br>
   Did heare the king saye soe,<br>
 The sorrowe of her grieved heart<br>
   Her outward lookes did showe.</p>
 <p>And from her cleare and crystall eyes<br>
   The teares gusht out apace,<br>
 Which, like the silver-pearled dewe,<br>
   Ranne downe her comely face.</p>
 <p><a name="page_63"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 63</font></a></p>
 <p>Her lippes, erst like the corall redde,<br>
   Did waxe both wan and pale,<br>
 And for the sorrow she conceivde<br>
   Her vitall spirits faile.</p>
 <p>And falling downe all in a swoone<br>
   Before King Henryes face,<br>
 Full oft he in his princelye armes<br>
   Her bodye did embrace.</p>
 <p>And twentye times, with watery eyes,<br>
   He kist her tender cheeke,<br>
 Untill he had revivde againe<br>
   Her senses milde and meeke.</p>
 <p>"Why grieves my Rose, my sweetest Rose?"<br>
   The king did often say:<br>
 "Because," quoth shee, "to bloodye warres<br>
   My lord must part awaye.</p>
 <p>"But since your Grace on forrayne coastes,<br>
   Amonge your foes unkinde,<br>
 Must goe to hazard life and limbe,<br>
   Why should I staye behinde?</p>
 <p><a name="page_64"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 64</font></a></p>
 <p>"Nay, rather let me, like a page,<br>
   Your sworde and target beare;<br>
 That on my breast the blowes may lighte,<br>
   Which would offend you there.</p>
 <p>"Or lett mee, in your royal tent,<br>
   Prepare your bed at nighte,<br>
 And with sweete baths refresh your grace,<br>
   At your returne from fighte.</p>
 <p>"So I your presence may enjoye<br>
   No toil I will refuse;<br>
 But wanting you, my life is death:<br>
   Nay, death Ild rather chuse."</p>
 <p>"Content thy self, my dearest love,<br>
   Thy rest at home shall bee,<br>
 In Englandes sweet and pleasant isle;<br>
   For travell fits not thee.</p>
 <p>"Faire ladies brooke not bloodye warres;<br>
   Soft peace their sexe delightes;<br>
 Not rugged campes, but courtlye bowers;<br>
   Gay feastes, not cruell fightes.</p>
 <p><a name="page_65"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 65</font></a></p>
 <p>"My Rose shall safely here abide,<br>
   With musicke passe the daye,<br>
 Whilst I amonge the piercing pikes<br>
   My foes seeke far awaye.</p>
 <p>"My Rose shall shine in pearle and golde,<br>
   Whilst Ime in armour dighte;<br>
 Gay galliards here my love shall dance,<br>
   Whilst I my foes goe fighte.</p>
 <p>"And you, Sir Thomas, whom I truste<br>
   To bee my loves defence,<br>
 Be carefull of my gallant Rose<br>
   When I am parted hence."</p>
 <p>And therewithall he fetcht a sigh,<br>
   As though his heart would breake;<br>
 And Rosamonde, for very griefe,<br>
   Not one plaine word could speake.</p>
 <p>And at their parting well they mighte<br>
   In heart be grieved sore:<br>
 After that daye, faire Rosamonde<br>
   The king did see no more.</p>
 <p><a name="page_66"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 66</font></a></p>
 <p>For when his Grace had past the seas,<br>
   And into France was gone,<br>
 With envious heart, Queene Ellinor<br>
   To Woodstocke came anone.</p>
 <p>And forth she calls this trustye knighte<br>
   In an unhappy houre,<br>
 Who, with his clue of twined-thread,<br>
   Came from this famous bower.</p>
 <p>And when that they had wounded him,<br>
   The queene this thread did gette,<br>
 And wente where Ladye Rosamonde<br>
   Was like an angell sette.</p>
 <p>But when the queene with stedfast eye<br>
   Beheld her beauteous face,<br>
 She was amazed in her minde<br>
   At her exceeding grace.</p>
 <p>Cast off from thee those robes," she said,<br>
   "That riche and costlye bee;<br>
 And drinke thou up this deadlye draught<br>
   Which I have brought to thee."</p>
 <p> </p>

 <p> </p>
 <p><a name="page_67"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 67</font></a></p>
 <p>Then presentlye upon her knees<br>
   Sweet Rosamonde did falle;<br>
 And pardon of the queene she crav'd<br>
   For her offences all.</p>
 <p>"Take pitty on my youthfull yeares,"<br>
   Faire Rosamonde did crye;<br>
 "And lett mee not with poison stronge<br>
   Enforcèd bee to dye.</p>
 <p>"I will renounce my sinfull life,<br>
   And in some cloyster bide;<br>
 Or else be banisht, if you please,<br>
   To range the world soe wide.</p>
 <p>"And for the fault which I have done,<br>
   Though I was forc'd theretoe,<br>
 Preserve my life, and punish mee<br>
   As you thinke meet to doe."</p>
 <p>And with these words, her lillie handes<br>
   She wrunge full often there;<br>
 And downe along her lovely face<br>
   Did trickle many a teare.</p>
 <p><a name="page_68"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 68</font></a></p>
 <p>But nothing could this furious queene<br>
   Therewith appeased bee;<br>
 The cup of deadlye poyson stronge,<br>
   As she knelt on her knee,</p>
 <p>She gave this comelye dame to drinke;<br>
   Who tooke it in her hand,<br>
 And from her bended knee arose,<br>
   And on her feet did stand,</p>
 <p>And casting up her eyes to heaven,<br>
   Shee did for mercye calle;<br>
 And drinking up the poison stronge,<br>
   Her life she lost withalle.</p>
 <p>And when that death through everye limbe<br>
   Had showde its greatest spite,<br>
 Her chiefest foes did plain confesse<br>
   Shee was a glorious wight.</p>
 <p>Her body then they did entomb,<br>
   When life was fled away,<br>
 At Godstowe, neare to Oxford towne,<br>
   As may be seene this day.</p>
