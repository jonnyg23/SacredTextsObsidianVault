 <h1 align="CENTER">Barbara Allen's Cruelty</h1>
 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>ALL in the merry month of May,<br>
   When green buds they were swelling,<br>
 Young Jemmy Grove on his death-bed lay<br>
   For love o' Barbara Allen.</p>
 <p>He sent his man unto her then,<br>
   To the town where she was dwelling:<br>
 "O haste and come to my master dear,<br>
   If your name be Barbara Allen."</p>
 <p>Slowly, slowly rase she up,<br>
   And she cam' where he was lying;<br>
 And when she drew the curtain by,<br>
   Says, "Young man, I think you're dying."</p>
 <p><a name="page_83"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 83</font></a></p>
 <p>"O it's I am sick, and very, very sick,<br>
   And it's a' for Barbara Allen."<br>
 "O the better for me ye'se never be,<br>
   Tho' your heart's blude were a-spilling!</p>
 <p>"O dinna ye min', young man," she says,<br>
   "When the red wine ye were filling,<br>
 That ye made the healths gae round and round<br>
   And ye slighted Barbara Allen?"</p>
 <p>He turn'd his face unto the wa',<br>
   And death was wi' him dealing:<br>
 "Adieu, adieu, my dear friends a';<br>
   Be kind to Barbara Allen."</p>
 <p>As she was walking o'er the fields,<br>
   She heard the dead-bell knelling;<br>
 And every jow the dead-bell gave,<br>
   It cried, "Woe to Barbara Allen!"</p>
 <p>"O mother, mother, mak' my bed,<br>
   To lay me down in sorrow.<br>
 My love has died for me to-day,<br>
   I'll die for him to-morrow."</p>
