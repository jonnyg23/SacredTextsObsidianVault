 <h1 align="CENTER">The Banks o' Yarrow</h1>
 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>LATE at e'en, drinking the wine,<br>
   And ere they paid the lawing,<br>
 They set a combat them between,<br>
   To fight it in the dawing.</p>
 <p>"What though ye be my sister's lord,<br>
   We'll cross our swords to-morrow."<br>
 "What though my wife your sister be,<br>
   I'll meet ye then on Yarrow."</p>
 <p>"O stay at hame, my ain gude lord!<br>
   O stay, my ain dear marrow!<br>
 My cruel brither will you betray<br>
   On the dowie banks o' Yarrow."</p>
 <p><a name="page_172"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 172</font></a></p>
 <p>"O fare ye weel, my lady dear!<br>
   And put aside your sorrow;<br>
 For if I gae, I'll sune return<br>
   Frae the bonny banks o' Yarrow."</p>
 <p>She kiss'd his cheek, she kaim'd his hair,<br>
   As oft she'd done before, O;<br>
 She belted him wi' his gude brand,<br>
   And he's awa' to Yarrow.</p>
 <p>When he gaed up the Tennies bank,<br>
   As he gaed mony a morrow,<br>
 Nine armed men lay in a den,<br>
   On the dowie braes o' Yarrow.</p>
 <p>"O come ye here to hunt or hawk<br>
   The bonny Forest thorough?<br>
 Or come ye here to wield your brand<br>
   Upon the banks o' Yarrow?"</p>
 <p>"I come not here to hunt or hawk,<br>
   As oft I've dune before, O,<br>
 But I come here to wield my brand<br>
   Upon the banks o' Yarrow.</p>
 <p><a name="page_173"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 173</font></a></p>
 <p>"If ye attack me nine to ane,<br>
   Then may God send ye sorrow!--<br>
 Yet will I fight while stand I may,<br>
   On the bonny banks o' Yarrow."</p>
 <p>Two has he hurt, and three has slain,<br>
   On the bloody braes o' Yarrow;<br>
 But the stubborn knight crept in behind,<br>
   And pierced his body thorough.</p>
 <p>"Gae hame, gae hame, you brither John,<br>
   And tell your sister sorrow,--<br>
 To come and lift her leafu' lord<br>
   On the dowie banks o' Yarrow."</p>
 <p>Her brither John gaed ower yon hill,<br>
   As oft he'd dune before, O;<br>
 There he met his sister dear,<br>
   Cam' rinnin' fast to Yarrow.</p>
 <p>"I dreamt a dream last night," she says,<br>
   "I wish it binna sorrow;<br>
 I dreamt I pu'd the heather green<br>
   Wi' my true love on Yarrow."</p>
 <p><a name="page_174"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 174</font></a></p>
 <p>"I'll read your dream, sister," he says,<br>
   "I'll read it into sorrow;<br>
 Ye're bidden go take up your love,<br>
   He's sleeping sound on Yarrow."</p>
 <p>She's torn the ribbons frae her head<br>
   That were baith braid and narrow;<br>
 She's kilted up her lang claithing,<br>
   And she's awa' to Yarrow.</p>
 <p>She's ta'en him in her arms twa,<br>
   And gi'en him kisses thorough;<br>
 She sought to bind his mony wounds,<br>
   But he lay dead on Yarrow.</p>
 <p>"O haud your tongue," her father says,<br>
   "And let be a' your sorrow;<br>
 I'll wed you to a better lord<br>
   Than him ye lost on Yarrow."</p>
 <p>"O haud your tongue, father," she says,<br>
   "Far warse ye mak' my sorrow;<br>
 A better lord could never be<br>
   Than him that lies on Yarrow."</p>
 <p><a name="page_175"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 175</font></a></p>
 <p>She kiss'd his lips, she kaim'd his hair,<br>
   As aft she had dune before, O;<br>
 And there wi' grief her heart did break,<br>
   Upon the banks o' Yarrow.</p>
