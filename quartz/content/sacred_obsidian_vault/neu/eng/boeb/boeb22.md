 <h1 align="CENTER">The Fause Lover</h1>
 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>A FAIR maid sat in her bower door,<br>
   Wringing her lily hands;<br>
 And by it came a sprightly youth,<br>
   Fast tripping o'er the strands.</p>
 <p>"Where gang ye, young John," she says,<br>
   "Sae early in the day?<br>
 It gars me think, by your fast trip,<br>
   Your journey's far away."</p>
 <p>He turn'd about wi' surly look,<br>
   And said, "What's that to thee?<br>
 I'm ga'en to see a lovely maid,<br>
   Mair fairer far than ye."</p>
 <p><a name="page_149"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 149</font></a></p>
 <p>"Now hae ye play'd me this, fause love,<br>
   In simmer, 'mid the flowers?<br>
 I shall repay ye back again,<br>
   In winter, 'mid the showers.</p>
 <p>"But again, dear love, and again, dear love,<br>
   Will ye not turn again?<br>
 For as ye look to ither women,<br>
   I shall do to other men."</p>
 <p>"Make your choice o' whom you please,<br>
   For I my choice will have;<br>
 I've chosen a maid more fair than thee,<br>
   I never will deceive."</p>
 <p>But she's kilt up her claithing fine,<br>
   And after him gaed she;<br>
 But aye he said, "Ye'll turn again,<br>
   Nae farder gae wi' me."</p>
 <p>But again, dear love, and again, dear love,<br>
   Will ye never love me again?<br>
 Alas! for loving you sae well,<br>
   And you na me again."</p>

 <p>The firstan' town that they came till,<br>
   He bought her brooch and ring;<br>
 But aye he bade her turn again,<br>
   And gang nae farder wi' him.</p>
 <p>"But again, dear love, and again, dear love," etc.</p>
 <p>The nextan' town that they came till,<br>
   He bought her muff and gloves;<br>
 But aye he bade her turn again,<br>
   And choose some other loves.</p>
 <p>But again, dear love, and again, dear love," etc.</p>
 <p>The nextan' town that they came till,<br>
   His heart it grew mair fain;<br>
 And he was deep in love wi' her.<br>
   As she was ower again.</p>
 <p>The nextan' town that they came till,<br>
   He bought her wedding gown;<br>
 And made her lady o' ha's and bowers,<br>
   In sweet Berwick town.</p>
