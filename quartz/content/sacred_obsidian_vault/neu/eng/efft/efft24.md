 <h1 align="CENTER">EDWIN AND SIR TOPAZ.  <a name="fr_30"></a><a href="#fn_30"><font size="1">1</font></a></h1>
 <p>IN Britain's isle and Arthur's days, <br>
 When midnight faeries daunc'd the maze.<br>
 Liv'd Edwin of the green;<br>
 Edwin, I wis, a gentle youth, <br>
 Endow'd with courage, sense, and truth,<br>
 Though badly shap'd he been.</p>
 <p>His mountain back mote well be said <br>
 To measure heighth against his head,<br>
 And lift itself above:<br>
 Yet spite of all that Nature did To make his uncouth form forbid, <br>
 This creature dar'd to love.</p>
 <p>He felt the charms of Edith's eyes, <br>
 Nor wanted hope to gain the prize, <br>
 Could ladies look within;<br>
 But one Sir Topaz dress'd with art, <br>
 And, if a shape could win a heart, <br>
 He had a shape to win.</p>
 <p>Edwin, if right I read my song, <br>
 With slighted passion pac'd along <br>
 All in the moony light:<br>
 'Twas near an old enchanted court, <br>
 Where sportive faeries made resort <br>
 To revel out the night.</p>
 <p>His heart was drear, his hope was crossd, <br>
 'Twas late, 'twas farr, the path was lost <br>
 That reach'd the neighbour-town;<br>
 With weary steps he quits the shades, <br>
 Resolv'd the darkling dome he treads, <br>
 And drops his limbs adown.</p>
 <p>But scant he lays him on the floor, <br>
 When hollow winds remove the door, <br>
 A trembling rocks the ground:<br>
 And, well I ween to count aright, <br>
 At once an hundred tapers light <br>
 On all the walls around.</p>
 <p>Now sounding tongues assail his ear, <br>
 Now sounding feet approachen near, <br>
 And now the sounds encrease;<br>
 And from the corner where he lay <br>
 He sees a train profusely gay <br>
 Come pranckling o'er the place.</p>
 <p>But, trust me, gentles, never yet <br>
 Was dight a masquing half so neat, <br>
 Or half so rich before;<br>
 The country lent the sweet perfumes, <br>
 The sea the pearl, the sky the plumes, <br>
 The town its silken store.</p>
 <p>Now whilst he gazed, a gallant drest <br>
 In flaunting robes above the rest, <br>
 With awfull accent cried:<br>
 "What mortal of a wretched mind, <br>
 Whose sighs infect the balmy wind, <br>
 Has here presumed to hide?"</p>
 <p>At this the swain, whose venturous soul <br>
 No fears of magic art controul, <br>
 Advanc'd in open sight.<br>
 "Nor have I cause of dreed," he said, <br>
 "Who view, by no presumption led, <br>
 Your revels of the night.</p>
 <p>"'Twas grief for scorn of faithful love, <br>
 Which made ray steps unweeting rove <br>
 Amid the nightly dew."<br>
 "'Tis well," the gallant cries again, <br>
 "We faeries never injure men <br>
 Who dare to tell us true.</p>
 <p>"Exalt thy love-dejected heart, <br>
 Be mine the task, or ere we part, <br>
 To make thee grief resign;<br>
 Now take the pleasure of thy chaunce; <br>
 Whilst I with Mab, my partner, daunce, <br>
 Be little Mable thine!"</p>
 <p>He spoke, and all a sudden there <br>
 Light musick floats in wanton air; <br>
 The monarch leads the queen;<br>
 The rest their faerie partners found, <br>
 And Mable trimly tript the ground <br>
 With Edwin of the green.</p>
 <p>The dauncing past, the board was laid, <br>
 And siker such a feast was made<br>
 As heart and lip desire;<br>
 Withouten hands the dishes fly, <br>
 The glasses with a wish come nigh,<br>
 And with a wish retire</p>
 <p>But now to please the faery king, <br>
 Full every deal they laugh and sing, <br>
 And antick feats devise;<br>
 Some wind and tumble like an ape, <br>
 And other-some transmute their shape <br>
 In Edwin's wondering eyes.</p>
 <p>Till one at last that Robin hight, <br>
 Renown'd for pinching maids by night, <br>
 Has hent him up aloof;<br>
 And full against the beam he flung, <br>
 Where by the back the youth he hung <br>
 To sprawl unneath the roof.</p>
 <p>From thence, "Reverse my charm," he cries <br>
 "And let it fairly now suffice<br>
 The gambol has been shown." <br>
 But Oberon answers with a smile, <br>
 "Content thee, Edwin, for a while,<br>
 The vantage is thine own."</p>
 <p>Here ended all the phantome play; <br>
 They smelt the fresh approach of day, <br>
 And heard a cock to crow;<br>
 The whirling wind that bore the crowd <br>
 Has clapp'd the door, and whistled loud <br>
 To warn them all to go.</p>
 <p>Then screaming all at once they fly, <br>
 And all at once the tapers die; <br>
 Poor Edwin falls to floor;<br>
 Forlorn his state, and dark the place, <br>
 Was never wight in such a case <br>
 Through all the land before.</p>
 <p>But soon as Dan Apollo rose, <br>
 Full jolly creature home he goes, <br>
 He feels his back the less;<br>
 His honest tongue and steady mind <br>
 Han rid him of the lump behind <br>
 Which made him want success.</p>
 <p>With lusty livelyhed he talks, <br>
 He seems adauncing as he walks; <br>
 His story soon took wind;<br>
 And beauteous Edith sees the youth, <br>
 Endow'd with courage, sense, and truth, <br>
 Without a bunch behind.</p>
 <p>The story told, Sir Topaz mov'd, <br>
 The youth of Edith erst approv'd, <br>
 To see the revel scene.<br>
 At close of eve he leaves his home, <br>
 And wends to find the ruin'd dome <br>
 All on the gloomy plain.</p>
 <p>As there he bides, it so befell, <br>
 The wind came rustling down a dell, <br>
 A shaking seiz'd the wall:<br>
 Up sprang the tapers as before, <br>
 The faeries bragly foot the floor, <br>
 And musick fills the hall.</p>
 <p>But, certes, sorely sunk with woe, <br>
 Sir Topaz sees the elfin show,<br>
 His spirits in him die:<br>
 When Oberon cries, "A man is near <br>
 A mortall passion, cleeped fear,<br>
 Hangs flagging in the sky."</p>
 <p>With that Sir Topaz, hapless youth, <br>
 In accents faultering ay for ruth <br>
 Intreats them pity graunt;<br>
 For als he been a mister wight <br>
 Betray'd by wandering in the night <br>
 To tread the circled haunt.</p>
 <p>"Ah losell vile!" at once they roar, <br>
 "And little skill'd of faerie lore, <br>
 Thy cause to come we know:<br>
 Now has thy kestrell courage fell; <br>
 And faeries, since a lie you tell, <br>
 Are free to work thee woe."</p>
 <p>Then Will, who bears the wispy fire <br>
 To trail the swains among the mire, <br>
 The caitive upward flung;<br>
 There like a tortoise in a shop <br>
 He dangled from the chamber-top <br>
 Where whilome Edwin hung.</p>
 <p>The revel now proceeds apace, <br>
 Deffly they frisk it o'er the place, <br>
 They sit, they drink, and eat;<br>
 The time with frolick mirth beguile, <br>
 And poor Sir Topaz hangs the while <br>
 Till all the rout retreat.</p>
 <p>By this the starrs began to wink, <br>
 They shriek, they fly, the tapers sink, <br>
 And down ydrops the knight:<br>
 For never spell by faerie laid <br>
 With strong enchantment bound a glade <br>
 Beyond the length of night.</p>
 <p>Chill, dark, alone, adreed, he lay, <br>
 Till up the welkin rose the day, <br>
 Then deem'd the dole was o'er:<br>
 But wot ye well his harder lot? <br>
 His seely back the bunch has got <br>
 Which Edwin lost afore.</p>
 <p>This tale a Sybil-nurse ared; <br>
 She softly stroked my youngling head,<br>
 And when the tale was done,<br>
 "Thus some are born, my son," she cried<br>
 "With base impediment to rise,<br>
 And some are born with none.</p>
 <p>"But virtue can itself advance <br>
 To what the favourite fools of chance<br>
 By fortune seem'd design'd; <br>
 Virtue can gain the odds of fate, <br>
 And from itself shake off the weight<br>
 Upon th' unworthy mind."</p>
