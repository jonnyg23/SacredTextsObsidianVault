 <pre>
 
 171A.*	 * * *
 	 . . . .
 	 . . . .
 	 Ffor if your boone be askeable,
 	 Soone granted it shalbe:
 171A.2	 If it be not touching my crowne, he said,
 	 Nor hurting poore comminaltye.
 	 Nay, it is not touching your crowne, shee sayes,
 	 Nor hurting poore cominaltye,
 171A.3	 But I begg the death of Thomas Cromwell,
 	 For a false traitor to you is hee.
 	 Then feitch me hither the Earle of Darby
 	 And the Earle of Shrewsbury,
 171A.4	 And bidde them bring Thomas Cromawell;
 	 Lets see what he can say to mee;
 	 For Thomas had woont to haue carryed his head vp,
 	 But now he hanges it vppon his knee.
 171A.5	 How now? How now? the king did say,
 	 Thomas, how is it with thee?
 	 Hanging and drawing, O king! he saide;
 	 You shall neuer gett more from mee.
