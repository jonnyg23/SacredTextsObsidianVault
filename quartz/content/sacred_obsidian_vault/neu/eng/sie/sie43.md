 <p>Children of the future Age,<br> Reading this indignant page;<br> Know that in a former time,<br> Love! sweet Love! was thought a crime.</p>  
 <p>In the Age of Gold,<br> Free from winters cold:<br> Youth and maiden bright,<br> To the holy light,<br> Naked in the sunny beams delight.</p>  
 <p>Once a youthful pair<br> Fill’d with softest care:<br> Met in garden bright,<br> Where the holy light,<br> Had just removd the curtains of the night.</p>  
 <p>There in rising day,<br> On the grass they play:<br> Parents were afar:<br> Strangers came not near:<br> And the maiden soon forgot her fear.</p>  
 <p>Tired with kisses sweet<br> They agree to meet,<br> When the silent sleep<br> Waves o’er heavens deep;<br> And the weary tired wanderers weep.</p>  
 <p>To her father white<br> Came the maiden bright:<br> But his loving look,<br> Like the holy book,<br> All her tender limbs with terror shook.</p>  
 <p>Ona! pale and weak!<br> To thy father speak:<br> O the trembling fear!<br> O the dismal care!<br> That shakes the blossoms of my hoary hair</p>
