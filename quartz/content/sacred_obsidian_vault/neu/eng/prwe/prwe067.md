 <p align="CENTER">MINCAMBER, MAIN-AMBER OR AMBROSE'S
 STONE.</p>
 <p><br>
 MIGHTY Logan Stone was poised and blessed by Ambrose Merlin, not far from
 Penzance. "So great," says Drayton, in his "Polyalbion," "that many men's
 united strength cannot remove it, yet with one finger you may wag it."</p>
 <p>Merlin proclaimed that this stone should stand until England
 had no king; and Scawen tells us--</p>
 <p>"Here, too, we may add what wrong another sort of strangers
 have done to us, especially in the civil wars, and in particular by the
 destroying of Mincamber, a famous monument, being a rock of infinite weight,
 which, as a burden, was laid upon other great stones, and yet so equally
 thereon poised up by nature only, that a little child could instantly move it,
 but no one man, or many, remove it. This natural monument all travellers that
 came that way desired to behold; but in the time of Oliver's usurpation, when
 all monumental things became despicable, one Shrubsall, one of Oliver's
 heroes, then Governor of Pendennes, by labour and much ado, caused to be
 undermined and thrown down, to the great grief of the country, but to his own
 great glory, as he thought; doing it, as he said, with a small cane in his
 hand. I myself have heard him to boast of this act, being a prisoner under
 him." [a]</p>
 <p>So was Merlin's prophecy fulfilled.</p>
