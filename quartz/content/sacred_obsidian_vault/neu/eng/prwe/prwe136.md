 ST NEOT AND THE FOX.</p>
 <p>
  One
 day the holy hermit was standing in his bath chanting the Psalms, when he
 heard the sound of huntsmen approaching.</p>
 <p>
 Whether the saint feared, ridicule or
 ill-treatment, we know not; but certainly he left some psalms unsung that
 day, and hastily gathering up his clothes, he fled to his cell.</p>
 <p>
 In his haste the good man lost his shoe, and a
 hungry fox having escaped the hunters, came to the spring to drink. Having
 quenched the fever of thirst, and being hungry, he spied the saint's shoe, and
 presently ate it. The hermit despatched his servant to look for his shoe; and,
 lo, he found the fox cast into a deep sleep, and the thongs of the shoe hanging
 out of his vile mouth. Of  course the shoe was pulled out of his stomach, and restored to the saint.</p>
