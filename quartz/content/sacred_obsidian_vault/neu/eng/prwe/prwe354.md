 <p align="CENTER">SARACEN</p>
 <p>THE term Saracen is always now supposed to apply to
 the Moors. This is not exactly correct. Percy, for example, in his
 "Essay on the Ancient Minstrels," says, "The old metrical romance of
 'Horn Child,' which, although from the mention of Saracens, &amp;c., it must
 have been written, at least, after the First Crusade in 1096, yet, from
 its Anglo-Saxon language or idiom, can scarcely be dated later than
 within a century after the Conquest." I think this ballad, and several
 others of an early date, prove the application of this term to some
 Oriental people previous to the Crusades. Soldàin, soldàn, regarded as a
 corruption of sultan,-- </p>
 <p>
 "Whoever will fight yon grimme soldàn,</p>
 <p>
 Right fair his meede shall be,"</p>
 <p>is clearly n much older term, applied to any grim
 Eastern tyrant, and especially to the Oriental giants. It would not be a
 difficult task to show that the word "Saracen," as used in Cornwall,--' '<i>Atal
 Saracen !</i>" "<i>Oh, he's a Saracen !</i>" &amp;c., was applied to the
 foreigners who traded with this country for tin at a very early period.</p>
