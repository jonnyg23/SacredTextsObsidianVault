 <p>THE following letter, addressed to the publisher of the
 first and second editions of this book, will be read with interest :-- <br>
 <br>
 263 HAMPSTRAD ROAD, NW., April 18th, 1865<br>
 </p>
 <p>DEAR MR. HOTTEN,-- I have received your note, in which you
 express a doubt as to whether some portion of the public will understand my
 representation of the Giant</p>
 <p>Bolster."</p>
 <p>To all such persons, I would beg of them to reflect, that
 if a giant could stride six miles across a country, he must be twelve miles
 in height, according to the proportions of the human figure. In order to get
 a sight of the head of such a giant, the spectator must be distant a mite or
 two from the figure. This would, by adding half the "stride" and above
 eleven mites perpendicular, place the spectator about fifteen miles distant
 from the giant's head, which head, to proportion to the other parts of the
 body, would be about three-quarters of a mile, measuring from the chin to
 the crown of the head. Now, let any one calculate, according to the laws of
 perspective, what size such a head would be at such a distance. To give a
 little insight into the matter of perspective, let any one imagine that they
 are looking down a street, fifteen miles long, of large houses, and then
 caculate what <i>size</i> the <i>last</i> house would be at the farther end
 of the Street; and it must therefore be recollected that every part of such
 a huge body must lessen in the same way--body and limbs--smaller by
 degrees, if not beautifully less.</p>
 <p>I selected this subject from, my friend Robert Hunt's
 work as, one of the numerous proofs, which are shown in both the volumes, of
 the horrible dark ignorance of the Early Ages--a large amount of which
 ignorance and darkness, I am sorry to find, still remains. I hope that these
 few inns will explain satisfactorily why Giant "Bolster" has been thus
 displayed by,</p>
 <p>-- Yours truly,                                                                                                       GEORGE CRUIKSHANK</p>
 <p>P.S.--The first time that I put a very large figure in
 perspective was about forty years back, in illustrating that part of"
 Paradise Lost' where Milton describes Satan as</p>
 <p>"Prone on, the flood, extended long and
 large,</p>
 <p>Lay floating many a rood."</p>
 <p>This I never published, but possibly I may do so one of
 these days.</p>
