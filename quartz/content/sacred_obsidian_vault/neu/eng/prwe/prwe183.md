 MADAM NOY AND OLD JOAN.</p>
 <p>THEY say that, a long time since, there lived an old
 witch down by Alsia Mill, called Joan. Everybody feared to offend the old
 woman, and gave her everything she looked for, except Madam Noy, who lived
 in Pendrea.</p>
 <p>Madam Noy had some beautiful hens of a new sort, with
 "cops" on their heads.</p>
 <p>One morning early, Joan comes up to Pendrea, so as to
 catch Madam Noy going out into the farmyard, with her basket of corn to feed
 her poultry, and to collect the eggs.</p>
 <p>Joan comes up nodding and curtsying every step. "Good
 morrow to your honour; how well you are looking, Madam Noy ! and, oh, what
 beautiful hens ! I 've got an old hen that I do want to set; will you sell
 me a dozen of eggs ? Those with the 'cops' I'd like to have best."</p>
 <p>Madam turned round half offended, and said, "I have none
 to sell, neither with the cops nor yet without the cops, whilst I have so
 many old clucking hens about, and hardly an egg to be found."</p>
 <p>"You surely wouldn't send me home empty as I came, madam
 dear ?"</p>
 <p>"You may go home the same way you came, for you aren't
 wanted here."</p>
 <p>"Now," croaked Joan, hoarse with passion, "as true as I
 tell you so, if you don't sell me some eggs, you will wish your cakes
 dough."</p>
 <p>As the old witch said this, she perched herself on the
 stile, shaking her finger and "nodling" her head.</p>
 <p>Madam Noy was a bit of a virago herself so she took up a
 stone and flung it at Joan; it hit her in the face, and made her jaws
 rattle.</p>
 <p>As soon as she recovered, she spinned forth</p>
 <p>"Madam Noy, you ugly old bitch,</p>
 <p>You shall have the gout, the palsy, and itch;</p>
 <p>All the eggs your hens lay henceforth shall be addle;</p>
 <p>All your hens have the pip, and die with the straddle;</p>
 <p>And ere I with the mighty fine madam have done,Of her
 favourite 'coppice' she shan't possess one."</p>
 <p>From that day forward, madam was always afflicted. The
 doctor from Penzance could do little for her. The fowls' eggs were always
 bad; the hens died, and madam lost all her "coppies." This is the way it
 came about--in the place of cops the brains came out--and all by the
 spells of old Joan.</p>
 <p>This forms the subject of one of the old Cornish drolls,
 which ran in an irregular jingle, such as the above, and was half sung, half
 said by the droll-teller.</p>
