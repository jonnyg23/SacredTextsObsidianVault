 <p align="CENTER">BOYER, MAYOR OF BODMIN</p>
 <p>IN the reign of Edward VI., Boyer was the mayor of Bodmin,
 and he appears to have been suspected of aiding in an insurrection of the
 men of Devonshire and Cornwall. However this may be, Sir Anthony Kingston,
 provost-marshal of the king's army, sent orders to Boyer to have a gibbet
 erected in the street opposite his own house by the next day at noon. He, at
 the same time, sent his compliments to the mayor, telling him that he should
 dine with him, in order to be present at the execution of some rebels.</p>
 <p>The unsuspecting mayor obeyed the command, and at the
 time appointed provided an entertainment for his guest. Kingston put about
 the wine, and when he observed the mayor's spirits were exhilarated, asked
 him if the gibbet was ready. Being told that it was, with a wanton and
 diabolical sneer he ordered the mayor to hanged upon it.</p>
 <p>At the same time a miller was ordered to be hanged; his
 servant was so deeply attached to him, that he went to Kingston and begged
 him to spare his master's life, even if he hung him in his place. "If you
 are so fond of hanging," said Kingston, "you shall not be disappointed," and
 he hanged the miller and his servant together.</p>
 <p>A similar story is told
 of a mayor of St Ives.</p>
