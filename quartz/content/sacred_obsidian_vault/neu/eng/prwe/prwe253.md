 <p align="CENTER">CURES FOR WHOOPING COUGH</p>
 <p>
  </p>
 <p>
 I.       GATHER nine spar stones from a
 running stream, taking care not to interrupt the free passage of the water
 in doing so Then dip a quart of water from the stream, which must be taken
 in the direction in which the stream runs ;-- by no means must the vessel
 be dipped against the stream. Then make the nine stones red hot, and throw
 them into the quart of water. Bottle the prepared water, and give the
 afflicted child a wine-glass of this water for nine mornings following. If
 this will not cure the whooping-cough, nothing else can, says the
 believer.</p>
 <p>
 II. A female donkey of three years old was
 taken, and, the child was drawn naked nine times over its back and under
 its belly. Then three spoonfuls of milk were drawn from the teats of the
 animal, and three hairs cut from the back and three hairs cut from the
 belly were placed in it, this was to stand for three hours to acquire the
 proper virtue, and then the child drank it in three doses.</p>
 <p>
 This ceremony was repeated three mornings
 running, and my informant said the child was always cured. I knew of
 several children who were treated in this manner in one of the small
 villages between Penzance and Madron Church town, some twenty or thirty
 years since. There were some doggerel lines connected with the ceremony,
 which have escaped my memory, and I have endeavoured, in vain, to find any
 one remembering them. They were to the effect that, as Christ placed the
 cross on the ass's back when he rode into Jerusalem, and so rendered the
 animal holy, if the child 'touched where Jesus sat, it should cough no
 more.</p>
