 <p align="CENTER">LAYING A GHOST.</p>
 <p>TO the ignorance of men in our age in this particular and
 mysterious part of philosophy and religion,--namely, the communication
 between spirits and men,--not one scholar out of ten thousand, though
 otherwise of excellent learning, knows anything of it, or the way how to
 manage it. This ignorance breeds fear and abhorrence of that which otherwise
 might be of incomparable benefit to mankind."</p>
 <p>Such is the concluding paragraph of "An Account of an
 Apparition, attested by the Rev. Wm. Ruddell, Minister at Launceston, in
 Cornwall," 1665.</p>
 <p>A schoolboy was haunted by Dorothy Dingley; we know not
 why, but the boy pined. He was thought to be in love; but when, at the
 wishes of his friends, the parson questioned him, he told him of his ghostly
 visitor, and he took the parson to the field in which he was in the habit of
 meeting the apparition; and the reverend gentleman himself saw the spectral
 Dorothy, and afterwards he showed her to the boy's father and mother. Then
 comes the story of the laying. "The next morning being Thursday, I went out
 very early by myself, and walked for about an hour's space in meditation and
 prayer in the field next adjoining to the Quartiles. Soon after five, I
 stepped over the stile into the disturbed field, and had not gone above
 thirty or forty paces before the ghost appeared at the further stile. I
 spoke to it with a loud voice, in some such sentences as the way of these
 dealings directed me; whereupon it approached, but slowly, and when I came
 near it it moved not. I spoke again, and it answered again in a voice which
 was neither very audible nor intelligible. I was not the least terrified,
 therefore I persisted until it spake again and gave me satisfaction. But the
 work could not be finished at this time; wherefore the same evening, an hour
 after sunset, it met me again, near the same place, and after a few words on
 each side it quietly vanished, and neither doth appear since, nor ever will
 more to any man's disturbance." [a]</p>
