 <p align="CENTER">THE GIANT OF NANCLEDRY.[a]</p>
 <p><br>
 IN Nancledry Bottoms, about a mile from the famous hill Castle-an-Dinas, there
 stood at one time a thatched house near the brook which runs murmuring down
 the valley. Rather more than thirty years since, some mouldering "clob" (mud)
 walls, indicating the existence at one time of a large dwelling, were pointed
 to as the former residence of a terrible giant. He appears to have led a
 solitary life, and to have lived principally on little children, whom he is
 said to have swallowed whole. His strength was indicated by several huge
 masses of granite which were scattered around the Bottoms, and in the
 neighbouring fields. These were carried by him in his pockets, to defend
 himself from the giants of Trecrobben, with whom he appears to have been on
 unfriendly terms. This giant is noteworthy as the only one recorded who lived
 in a house.</p>
