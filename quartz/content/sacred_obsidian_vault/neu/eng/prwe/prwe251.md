 THE CLUB-MOSS.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">
 (LYCOPODIUM INUNDATUM.)</p>
 <p>
  </p>
 <p>
 IF this moss is properly gathered, it is "good against all diseases of
 the eyes."</p>
 <p>
  The gathering is regarded as a
 mystery not to be lightly told; and if any man ventures to write the
 secret, the virtues of the moss avail him no more. I hope, therefore, my
 readers will fully value the sacrifice I make in giving them the formula
 by which they may be guided.</p>
 <p>
  On the third day of the moon --m when the
 thin crescent is seen for the first time--show it the knife with which
 the moss is to be cut, and repeat,-- <br>
 <br>
 "As Christ heal'd the issue of blood,<br>
 Do thou cut, what thou cuttest, for good !"</p>
 <p>
 At sun-down, having carefully washed the hands, the club-moss is to be
 cut kneeling. It is to be carefully wrapped in a white cloth, and
 subsequently boiled in some water taken from the spring nearest to its
 place of growth. This may be used as a fomenta­tion. Or the club-moss may
 be made into an ointment, with butter made from the milk of a new cow.</p>
