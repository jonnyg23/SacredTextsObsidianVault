 <p align="CENTER">THE ZENNOR CHARMERS.</p>
 <p>
  BOTH men and women in this parish possessed this power
 to a remarkable degree. They could stop blood, however freely it might be
 flowing. "Even should a pig be sticked in tie very place, if a charmer was
 present, and <i>thought</i> of his charm at the time, the pig would not
 bleed." This statement, made by a Zennor man, shows a tolerably large
 amount of faith in their power. The charmers are very cautious about
 communicating their charms. A man would not on any account tell his charm
 to a woman, or a woman communicate hers to a man. People will travel many
 miles to have themselves or their children charmed for "wildfires"
 (erysipelas), ringworms, pains in the limbs or teeth, "kennels" on the
 eyes (ulcerations). A correspondent writes me :-- "Near this lives a lady
 charmer, on whom I called. I found her to be a really clever, sensible
 woman. She was reading a learned treatise on ancient history. She told me
 there were but three charmers left in the west,--one at New Mill, one in
 Morva, and herself." Their charm for stopping blood is but another version
 of one given on another page.</p>
