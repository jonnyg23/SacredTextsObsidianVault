 <p align="CENTER">TEA-STALKS AND SMUT</p>
 <p>
  STEMS of tea floating in that beverage indicate strangers.
 Flakes of smut hanging loose to the fire-bars do the same thing.</p>
 <p>The time of the stranger's arrival may be known by placing
 the stem on the back of one hand and smacking it with the other:` the
 number of blows given before it is removed indicates the number of days
 before his arrival.</p>
 <p>The flake of carbon is blown upon, and according as it is
 removed by the first, second, or third blow, so is the time at the end of
 which the visitor may be expected.</p>
