 CURES FOR WARTS.</p>
 <p>
  </p>
 <p>
 I. THE vicar of Bodmin found, not long
 since, a bottle full of pins laid in a newly-made grave. I have heard of
 this as an unfailing remedy; each wart was touched with a new pin, and the
 pin then dropped into the bottle. I am not quite certain that it was
 necessary that the bottle should be placed in a newly-made grave; in many
 cases burying it in the earth, and especially at a "four cross-roads," was
 quite sufficient. As the pins rust, the warts decay.</p>
 <p>

 <p>
 II.  A piece of string should be taken,
 and as many knots tied on it as there are warts on the body; each wart
 being carefully touched with the knot dedicated to it. The string is then
 to be buried, and the warts fade away as it decays. A few years since a
 ship-wright in Devonport dockyard professed to cure warts by merely
 receiving from an indifferent person a knotted string,--the knots of
 which, had been tied by the afflicted. What he did with the string I know
 not.</p>
 <p>

 III.  To touch each wart with a pebble,
 place the pebbles in a bag, and to lose the bag on the way to church, was
 for many years a very favourite remedy; but the unfortunate person who
 found the bag received the warts. A lady once told me that she picked up
 such a bag, when a child, and out of curiosity, and in ignorance, examined
 the contents. The result was that she had, in a short time, as many warts
 as there were stones in the bag.</p>
 <p>

 <p>
 IV. Another remedy was to <i>steal</i> a
 piece of meat from a butcher's stall in the public market, and with this
 to touch the warts, and bury it. As the meat putrefied the warts decayed.</p>
 <p>
  </p>
 <p>V.        I
 remember, when quite a child, having a very large "seedy wart" on one of
 my fingers. I was taken by a distant relation, an elderly lady, residing
 in Gwinear, to some old woman, for the purpose of having this wart
 charmed. I well remember that two charred sticks were taken from the fire
 on the hearth, and carefully crossed over the fleshy excrescence, while
 some words were muttered by the charmer. I know not how long it was
 before the wart disappeared, but certainly, at some time, it did so.</p>
