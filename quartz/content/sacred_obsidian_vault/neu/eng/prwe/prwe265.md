 <p align="CENTER">SHOOTING STARS</p>
 <p>
  A MUCILAGINOUS substance is found on the damp ground near
 the granite quarries of Penryn, this is often very phosphorescent at
 night. The country people regard this as the substance of shooting stars.
 A tradesman of Penryn once brought me a bottle full of this substance for
 analysis, informing me that the men employed at the quarries, whenever
 they observed a shooting star, went to the spot near which they supposed
 it to fall, and they generally found a hatful of this mucus. It is curious
 that the Belgian peasants also call it "the substance of shooting stars"
 (" Phosphorescence," p. 109. By T. L. Phipson). This author says, "I have
 sketched the history of this curious substance in the <i>Journal dè
 Médecine et de Pharmacologie</i> of Bruxelles, for 1855. It was analysed
 chemically by Mulder, and anatomically by Carus, and from their
 observations appears to be the peculiar mucus which envelops the eggs of
 the frog. It swells to an enormous volume when it has free access to
 water. As seen upon the damp ground in spring, it was often mistaken for
 some species of fungus; it is, however, simply the spawn of frogs, which
 has been swallowed by some large crows or other birds, and afterwards
 vomited, from its peculiar property of swelling to an immense size in
 their bodies."</p>
 <p>In Mulder's account of its chemical composition given by
 Berselius in his <i>Rapport Annual</i>, he distinguishes it by designation
 of <i>mucilage atmosphérique. </i></p>
