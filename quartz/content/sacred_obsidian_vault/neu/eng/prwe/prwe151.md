 <p align="CENTER">ST CUTHBERT'S OR CUBERT'S WELL.</p>
 <p>HAL thus describes this famous place <i>:--" </i>In this
 parish is that famous and well-known spring of water called Holy-well (so
 named, the inhabitants say, for that the virtues of this water was first
 discovered on All-hallows day). The same stands in a dark cavern of the
 sea-cliff rocks, beneath full sea-mark on spring tides, from the top of
 which cavern falls down or distils continually drops of water from the
 white, blue, red, and green veins of those rocks. And accordingly, in the
 place where those drops of water fall, it swells to a lump of considerable
 bigness, and there petrifies to the hardness of ice, glass, or freestone, of
 the several colours aforesaid, according to the nature of those veins in the
 rock from whence it proceeds, and is of a hard, brittle nature, apt to break
 like glass.</p>
 <p>"The virtues of this water are very great. It is
 incredible what numbers in summer season frequent this place and waters from
 counties far distant." [a]</p>
 <p>[a] Gilbert, vol. i. p. 291</p>
