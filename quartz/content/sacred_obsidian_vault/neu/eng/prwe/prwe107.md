 <p align="CENTER">THE HAUNTED WIDOWER</p>
 <p>A LABOURING man, very shortly after his wife's death,
 .sent to a servant girl, living at the time in a small shipping port,
 requesting her to come to the inn to him. The girl went, and over a "ha'
 pint" she agreed to accept him as her husband.</p>
 <p>All went on pleasantly enough for a time. One evening the
 man met the girl. He was silent for some time and sorrowful, but at length
 he told her his wife had come back.</p>
 <p>"What do'st mean?" asked the girl; "have 'e seen hur?"</p>
 <p>"Naw, I han't seed her."</p>
 <p>"Why, how do'st knaw it is her then?"</p>
 <p>The poor man explained to her, that at night, when in
 bed, she would come to the side of it, and "flop" his face; and there was no
 mistaking her "flop."</p>
 <p>"So you knawed her flop, did 'e?" asked the girl.</p>
 <p>"Ay, it couldn't be mistook."</p>
 <p>"If she do hunt thee," said the girl, "she 'II hunt me;
 and if she do flop 'e, she 'II flop me,--so it must be off atween us."</p>
 <p>The unfortunate flop of the dead wife prevented the man
 from securing a living one.</p>
