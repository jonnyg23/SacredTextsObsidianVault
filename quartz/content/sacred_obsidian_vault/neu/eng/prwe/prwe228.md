 <p align="CENTER">DRINKING TO THE APPLE-TREES ON
 TWELFTH-NIGHT'S-EVE</p>
 <p>IN the eastern part of Cornwall, and in western
 Devonshire, it was the custom to take a milk-panful of cider, into which
 roasted apples had been broken, into the orchard This was placed as near the
 centre of the orchard as possible, and each person, taking a " clomben" cup
 of the drink, goes to different apple-trees, and addresses them as follows
 :-- </p>
 <p>Health to the good apple-tree; <br>
 Well to bear, pocketfuls, hatfuls, <br>
 Peckfuls, bushel-bagfuls."</p>
 <p>Drinking part of the contents of the cup, the remainder,
 with the fragments of the roasted apples, is thrown at the tree, all the
 company shouting aloud. Another account tells us, "In certain parts of
 Devonshire, the farmer, attended by his workmen, goes to the orchard this
 evening; and there, encircling one of the best-bearing trees, they drink the
 following toast three times--</p>
 <p>Here 's to thee, old apple-tree;<br>
 Hence thou mayst bud, and whence thou mayst blow, <br>
 And whence thou mayst bear apples enow !<br>
 Hats full caps full<br>
 Bushel, bushel-sacks full !</p>
 <p>And my pockets full, too! Huzza !'</p>
 <p>This done, they return to the house, tile doors of which
 they are sure to find bolted by the females, who, be the weather what it
 may, are inexorable to all entreaties to open them, till some one has
 guessed what is on the spit, which is generally some nice little thing
 difficult to be hit on, and is the reward of him who first names it. The
 doors are then thrown open, and the lucky clodpole receives the tit-bjt as
 his recompense. Some are so superstitious as to believe that if they neglect
 this custom, the trees will bear no apples that year." [a]</p>
 <p>Christmas-eve was selected in some parts of England as
 the occasion for wishing health to the apple-tree. Apples were roasted on a
 string until they fell into a pan of spiced ale, placed to receive them.
 This drink was called lamb's-wool, and with it the trees were wassailed, as
 in Devonshire and Cornwall.</p>
 <p>Herrick alludes to the custom :-- </p>
 <p>"Wassaile the trees, that they may beare<br>
 You many a plum, and many a peare;<br>
 For more or lease fruits they will bring,<br>
 And you do give them wassailing."</p>
 <p>May not Shakespeare refer to this ?--</p>
 <p>"Sometimes lurk I in a gossip's bowl,<br>
 In very likeness of a roasted crab;<br>
 And when she drinks, against her lips I bob,<br>
 And on her wither'd dew-lap pour the ale."<br>
 --Midsummer Night's Dream.</p>
 <p>In some localities apples are blessed on St James's Day,
 July 25.</p>
