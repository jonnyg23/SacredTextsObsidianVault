 <p align="CENTER">MERLYN'S PROPHECIES.</p>
 <p><br>
 PROPHECIES by Merlyn are tolerably prevalent in Cornwall. The character of
 these may be known by one or two examples --</p>
 <p>"Aga syth tyer, war and meyne Merlyn<br>
 Ara neb syth Leskey Paul, Penzance hag Newlyn." </p>
 <p>This has been translated--</p>
 <p>"There shall land on the stone of Merlyn,<br>
 Those who shall burn Paul, Penzance, and Newlyn."</p>
 <p>This prophecy is supposed to have been accomplished when the
 Spaniards, in the reign of Elizabeth, landed at Mousehole, a fishing village
 in the Mount's Bay. Near the pier at Mousehole is still a rock called
 "Merlyn Car," or "Merlyn's Rock," and not far from it another, called "the
 Spaniard."</p>
 <p>
 THE LEVAN STONE.</p>
 <p>
  This bisected mass of granite has been already noticed in con­nection
 with St Levan.</p>
 <p>
  "When, with panniers astride, <br>
 A pack-horse can ride <br>
 Through the Levan Stone, <br>
 The world will be done."</p>
 <p>
 THE RAME HEAD AND THE DODMAN.</p>
 <p>
 Merlyn is said to have pronounced the
 following prophecy, standing near St German's Grotto on the shores of Whitsand
 Bay:-- </p>
 <p>
 "When the Rame Head and Dodman meet,<br>
 Man and woman will have cause to greet."</p>
