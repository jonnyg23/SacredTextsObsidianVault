 THE DROWNED "HAILING
 THEIR NAMES."</p>
 <p><i>
  </i>THE fishermen dread to walk at night near those parts of the I shore
 where there may have been wrecks. The souls of the drowned sailors appear to
 haunt those. spots, and the "calling of the dead" has frequently been heard.
 I have been told that, under certain circumstances, especially before the
 coming of storms, or at certain seasons, but always at night, these callings
 are common. Many a fisherman has declared he has heard the voices of dead
 sailors "hailing their own names."</p>
