 <p align="CENTER">KING ARTHUR'S STONE.</p>
 <p><br>
 IN the western part of Cornwall, all the marks of any peculiar kind found on
 the rocks are referred either to the giants or the devil. In the eastern part
 of the county such markings are almost always attributed to Arthur. Not far
 from the Devil's Coit in St Columb, on the edge of the Gossmoor, there is a
 large stone, upon which are deeply-impressed marks, which a little fancy may
 convert into the marks of four horse-shoes. This is "King Arthur's Stone," and
 these marks were made by the horse upon which the British king rode when he
 resided at Castle Denis, and hunted on these moors. King Arthur's beds, and
 chairs, and caves, are frequently to be met with. The Giant's Coits,--and
 many traditions of these will be found in the section devoted to the giant
 romances--are probably monuments of the earliest types of rock mythology. Those
 of Arthur belong to the period when the Britons were so far advanced in
 civilisation as to war under experienced rulers; and those which are
 appropriated by the devil are evidently instances of the influence of
 priestcraft on the minds of an impressible people. [a]</p>
 <p>[a] Another example of like stories in
 Wales may be interesting --</p>
 <p>"Five juvenile saints, on their
 pilgrimage to the celebrated shrine of St David, emaciated with hunger, and
 exhausted with fatigue. here reclined themselves to rest, and reposed their
 weary heads on this ponderous pillow; their eyes were soon closed by the
 powerful hand of sleep, and they were no longer able to resist, by the force
 of prayer, the artifices of their foes. The sky was suddenly overwhelmed
 with clouds--the thunder rolled--the lightning flashed, and the lain
 poured in torrents. The storm increased in vehemence; all nature became
 chilled with cold, and even Piety and Charity felt its effects. The drops of
 rain were soon congealed into enormous hailstones, which, by the force of
 the wind, were driven with no much violence against the heads of the weary
 pilgrims an to affix them to their pillow, and the vestiges they left are
 still discernible. Being borne away in triumph by the malignant sorcerer who
 inhabits the hollows of these hills, they
 were concealed in the innermost recesses of his cavern, where they are
 destined to remain asleep, bound in the irrefragable chain of enchantment
 until that happy period shall arrive when the diocese shall be blessed with
 a pious bishop, for when that happens, no doubt Merlin himself, the enemy of
 malignant sorcerers, will be dis­enchanted, and he will come and restore to
 liberty the dormant saints, when they will immediately engage in the
 patriotic work of reforming the Welsh."--<i>From the English Works of the
 late Rev.. Eleazor Williams</i>, quoted by Warington W. Smyth, MA. Memoirs
 of the Geological Survey, vol. i. p. 480.</p>
