 <p align="CENTER">TREADING ON GRAVES</p>
 <p>
  </p>
 <p>"To see a man tread over graves,<br>
 I hold it no good mark;<br>
 'Tis wicked in the sun and moon,<br>
 And bad luck in the dark!"</p>
 <p>So sings Coleridge in his ballad of "The Three Graves."</p>
 <p>Whenever a person shivers from a sensation of cold down the
 spine, it is said some one is walking over his or her grave.</p>
 <p>Persons believing this, will give directions that they may be
 buried in some secluded corner of the churchyard, so that their corpse may not
 be disturbed by unholy footsteps.</p>
