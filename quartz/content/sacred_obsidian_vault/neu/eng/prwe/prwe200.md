 <p align="CENTER">ROMANCES OF FISHERMEN AND SAILORS.</p>
 <p>"I was saying to Jack, as we talk'd t' other day <br>
 About lubbers and snivelling elves,<br>
 That if people in life did not steer the right way, <br>
 They had nothing to thank but themselves. <br>
 Now, when a man's caught by those mermaids the girls<br>
 With their flattering palaver and smiles;<br>
 He runs, while he's list'ning to their fal de rals, <br>
 Bump ashore on the Scilly Isles."<br></p>

 <p align="CENTER">THE PILOT'S GHOST STORY.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">"On a sudden shrilly sounding,<br>
 Hideous yells and shrieks were heard;<br>
 Then each heart with fear confounding,<br>
 A sad troop of ghosts appear'd,<br>
 All in dreary hammocks shrouded,<br>
 Which for winding-sheets they wore."<br>
 <i>Admiral Hosier's Ghost.</i></p>
 
 <p>I PREFER giving this story in the words in which it was
 communicated. For its singular character, it is a ghost story well worth
 preserving :-- "Just seventeen years since, I went down on the wharf from my
 house one night about twelve and one in the morning, to see whether there
 was any 'hobble,' and found a sloop, the <i>Sally </i>of St Ives (the <i>
 Sally </i>was wrecked at St Ives one Saturday afternoon in the spring of
 1862), in the bay, bound for Hayle. When I got by the White Hart
 public-house, I saw a man leaning against a post on the wharf;--I spoke to
 him, wished him good morning, and asked him what o'clock it was, but to no
 purpose. I was not to be easily frightened, for .1 didn't believe in ghosts;
 and finding I got no answer to my repeated inquiries, I approached close to
 him and said, 'Thee 'rt a queer sort of fellow, not to speak; I 'd speak to
 the devil, if he were to speak to me. Who art a at all ? thee 'St needn't
 think to frighten me; that thee wasn't do, if thou wert twice so ugly; who
 art a at all ?.' He turned his great ugly face on me, glared abroad his
 great eyes, opened his - mouth, and it was a mouth sure nuff. Then I saw
 pieces of sea-weed and bits of sticks in his whiskers; the flesh of his face
 and hands were parboiled, just like a woman's hands after a good day's
 washing. Well, I did not like his looks a bit, and sheered off; but he
 followed close by my side, and I could hear the water squashing in his shoes
 every step he took. Well, I stopped a bit, and thought to be a little bit
 civil to him, and spoke to him again, but no answer. I then thought I would
 go to seek for another of our crew, and knock him up to get the vessel, and
 had got about fifty or sixty yards, when I turned to see if he was following
 me, but saw him where I left him. Fearing he would come after me, I ran for
 my life the few steps that I had to go. But when I got to the door, to my
 horror there stood the man in the door grinning horribly. I shook like an
 aspen-leaf; my hat lifted from my head; the sweat boiled out of me. What to
 do I didn't know, and in the house there was such a row, as if everybody was
 breaking up everything. After a bit I went in, for the door was 'on the
 latch,'--that is, not locked,--and called the captain of the boat, and got
 light, but everything was all right, nor had he heard any noise. We went out
 aboard of the <i>Sally, </i>and I put her into Hayle, but I felt ill enough
 to be in bed. I left the vessel to come home as soon as I could, but it took
 me four hours to walk two miles, and I had to lie down in the road, and was
 taken home to St Ives in a cart; as far as the Terrace from there <i>I </i>
 was carried home by my brothers, and put to bed. Three days afterwards all
 my hair fell off as if I had had my head shaved. The roots, and for about
 half an inch from the roots, being quite white. I was ill six months, and
 the doctor's bill was £4, 17s. 6d. for attendance and medicine. So you see I
 have reason to believe in the existence of spirits as much as Mr Wesley had.
 My hair grew again, and twelve months after I had as good a head of
 dark-brown hair as ever." [a]</p>
