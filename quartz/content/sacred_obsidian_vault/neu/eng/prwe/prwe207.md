 THE VOICE FROM THE SEA.</p>
 <p>A
 FISHERMAN or a pilot was walking one night on the sands at Porth-Towan,
 when all was still save the monotonous fall of the light waves upon the
 sand.</p>
 <p>
  He distinctly heard a voice from
 the sea exclaiming,--</p>
 <p>
  "The hour is come, but not the
 man."</p>
 <p>
  This was repeated three times, when a black figure, like that of a man,
 appeared on the top of the hill. It paused for a moment, then rushed
 impetuously down the steep incline, over the sands, and was lost in the sea.
 In different forms this story is told
 all around the Cornish coast.</p>
