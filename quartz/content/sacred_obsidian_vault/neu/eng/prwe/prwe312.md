 <p align="CENTER">THE HARLYN PIE [a]</p>
 <p>ADJOINING the Church of Constantine in the parish of
 St Merryn, was a cottage which a family of the name of Edwards held for
 generations, under the proprietors of Harlyn, by the annual render of
 a pie, made of limpets, raisins, and various herbs, on the eve of the
 festival in honour of the saint to whom the church was dedicated. The
 pie, as I have heard from my family, and from more ancient members of
 the family, and from old servants, was excellent. The Edwards had
 pursued for centuries the occupation of shepherds on Harlyn and
 Constantine Commons. The last died about forty years ago, and the
 wreck of their cottage is almost buried in the sand.<sup>" </sup>[b]</p>
