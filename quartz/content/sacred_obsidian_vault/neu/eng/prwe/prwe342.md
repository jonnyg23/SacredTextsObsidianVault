 <p align="CENTER">THE MERMAID'S VENGEANCE</p>
 <p>"INEVITABLE death awaits the wretch who is seduced by
 their charms. They seize and drown the swimmer, and entice the child; aitd
 when they anticipate that their malevolence will be gratified, they are seen
 gaily darting over the surface of the waters."</p>
 <p>Since lhis tale has been in type, my attention has been
 called to an article on, the "Popular Mythology of the Middle Ages," by Sir
 F. Palgrave, in the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, No. 44, 1820. The Nixies, to
 whom the above quotation especially refers, are in most respects like the
 Cornish mermaids.</p>
