 <p align="CENTER">THE GIANT OF MORVA [a]</p>
 <p><br>
 IN the Giant's Field in Morva still stand some granite fragments which once
 constituted the Giant's House. From this we see the Giant's Castle at
 Bosprenis, and the Giant's Cradle, thus perpetuating the infancy of the great
 man, and his subsequent power. The quoits used by this giant are numerous
 indeed. This great man, on the 1st day of August, would walk up to Bosprenis
 Croft, and there perform some magical rites, which were either never known, or
 they have 'been forgotten. On this day,--for when thus engaged the giant was
 harmless,--thousands of people would congregate to get a glimpse of the
 monster; and as he passed them,--all being seated on the stone hedges, --
 every one drank "to the health of Mr Giant." At length the giant died, but the
 gathering on the 1st of August has never been given up, or rather, the day
 shifts, and is made to agree with Morva Feast, which is held on the first
 Sunday in August.</p>
 <p>A Morva farmer writes:-- "A quarter of an acre would not
 hold the horses ridden to the fair,--the hedges being covered by the
 visitors, who drink and carouse as in former times. Morva Fair is, however,
 dying out."</p>
 <p>The parish-clerk informed me that the giant had twenty
 sons; that he was the first settler in these parts; and that he planted his
 children all round the coast. It was his custom to bring all his family
 together on the 1st of August, and hence the origin of the fair. Whichever may
 be the true account of the cause which established the fair and the feast,
 these romances clearly establish the fact that the giants were at the bottom
 of it.</p>
 <p>[a] The above notices were collected for me in Morva by
 the late C. Taylor Stephens, author of "The Chief of Barat-Anac," and "some
 time rural postman front St Ives to Zennor." Their connection with the
 traditions of Jack and Tom will be evident to every reader.</p>
