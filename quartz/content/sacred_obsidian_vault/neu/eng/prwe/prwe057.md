 <p align="CENTER">CHENEY'S HOUNDS.</p>
 <p><br>
 IN the parish of St Teath, a pack of hounds was once kept by an old squire
 named Cheney. How he or they died I cannot learn; but on "Cheney Downs" the
 ghosts of the dogs are sometimes seen, and often heard, in rough weather.</p>
 <p>In the western parishes of the county, I can name several
 places which are said to be haunted by the "wish hounds." [a]</p>
 <p>[a] See Athenaeum, No. 1013, March 27,
 1847. See Appendix L for Notes on the BARGEST.</p>
