 <p align="CENTER">ST PERRAN, THE MINERS' SAINT.</p>
 <p>ST PIRAN, or St Perran, has sometimes gained the credit of
 discovering tin in Cornwall; yet Usher places the date of his birth about
 the year <i>352; </i>and the merchants of Tyre are said to have traded with
 Cornwall for tin as early as the days of King Solomon.</p>
 <p>There are three places in Cornwall to which the name of
 Perran is given <i>;-- </i></p>
 
 <p>Perran-Aworthall--i. <i>e., Perran on the noted
 River.</i></p>
 
 <p>Perran-Uthno--i.e., <i>Perran the Little.</i></p>
 
 <p>Perran-Zabuloe--i.e., <i>Perran in the Sands.</i></p>
 
 <p>This sufficiently proves that the saint, or some one bearing
 that name, was eminently popular amongst the people; and in St Perran we
 have an example--of which several instances are given--of the manner in
 which a very ancient event is shifted forward, as it were, for the purpose
 of investing some popular hero with additional reasons for securing the
 devotion of the people, and of drawing them to his shrine. [a]</p>
 <p>Picnous, or Piecras, is another name which has been floating
 by tradition, down the stream of time, in connection with the discovery of
 tin; and in the eastern portion of Cornwall, Picrous-day, the second
 Thursday before Christmas-day, is kept as the tinners' holiday.</p>
 <p>The popular story of the discovery of tin is, however,
 given with all its anachronisms.</p>
 <p>[a] See Perran-Zabuloe, with an Account
 of the Past and Present State of the Oratory of St Picas in the Sands, and
 Remarks on its Antiquity. By the Rev. Wm. Haslam BA., and by the Rev. Collins
 Trelawney.</p>
 <p>St Kieran, the favourite Celtic saint,
 reached Scotland from Ireland, the precursor of St Columba (563 AD.). "The
 cave of St Kieran is still shown in Kintyre, where the</p>
 <p>first Christian teacher of the Western
 Highlands is believed to have made his abode."--<i>Wilson's Prehistoric
 Annals. </i>'</p>
 <p>There is a curious resemblance between
 the deeds and the names of those two saints.</p>
