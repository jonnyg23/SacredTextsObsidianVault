 <p align="CENTER">ON WASHING LINEN</p>
 <p>
  "THEY that wash Monday got all the week to dry, <br>
 They that wash Tuesday are pretty near by,<br>
 They that wash Wednesday make a good housewife,<br>
 They that wash Thursday must wash for their life,<br>
 They that wash Friday must wash in need,<br>
 They that wash Saturday are sluts indeed."</p>
