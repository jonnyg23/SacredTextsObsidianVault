 <p align="CENTER">REDRUTH WELL.</p>
 <p>NO child christened in this well has ever been hanged.
 Saint Ruth, said to have been called Red Ruth, because she always wore a
 scarlet cloak, especially blessed, to this extent, those waters. I believe
 the population in this large parish cares but little now whether their
 children be baptized with this well water or any other; but, half a century
 since, it was very different. Then, many a parent would insist on seeing the
 water taken from the well and carried to the font in the church.</p>
