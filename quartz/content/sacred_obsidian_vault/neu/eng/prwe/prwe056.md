 <p align="CENTER">THE WISH HOUNDS.</p>
 <p><br>
 THE tradition of the Midnight Hunter and his headless hounds--always, in
 Cornwall, associated with Tregeagle--prevails everywhere.</p>
 <p>The Abbot's Way on Dartmoor, an ancient road which extends
 into Cornwall, is said to be the favourite coursing ground of "the wish or
 wisked hounds of. Dartmoor," called also the "yell-hounds," and the
 "yeth-hounds." The valley of the Dewerstone is also the place of their
 midnight meetings. Once I was told at Jump, that Sir Francis Drake drove a
 hearse into Plymouth at night with headless horses, and that he was followed
 by a pack of "yelling hounds" without heads. If dogs hear the cry of the wish
 hounds they all die. May it not be that "wish" is connected with the
 west-country word "whist," meaning more than ordinary melancholy, a sorrow
 which has something weird surrounding it?</p>
 <p>"And then he sought the dark-green lane,<br>
 Whose willows mourn'd the faded year,<br>
 Sighing (I heard the love-lorn swain),<br>
 '<i>Wishness! oh, wishness</i>! walketh here.'"<br>
 -- The Wishful Swain of Devon. By POLWHELE.</p>
 <p>The author adds in a note, "An expression used by the
 vulgar in the north of Devon to express local melancholy. There is something
 sublime in this impersonation of <i>wishness</i>." The expression is as common
 in Cornwall as it is in Devonshire.</p>
 <p>Mr Kemble has the following incorrect remarks on this word
 :</p>
 <p>"In Devonshire to this day all magical or supernatural
 dealings go under the common name of wishtness. Can this have any reference to
 Woden's name 'wyse? " Mr Polwhele's note gives the true meaning of the word.
 Still Mr Kemble's idea is supported by the fact that "there are <i>Wishanger</i>
 (Wisehangre or Woden's Meadow), one about four miles south-west of Wanborough
 in Surrey, and another near Gloucester." [a] And we find also, "south-east of
 Pixhill in Tedstone, Delamere, there are Wishmoor and Inksmoor near Sapey
 Bridge in Whitbourn." [b]</p>
 <p>[a] Kemble's "Saxons in England," vol.
 i., p. 346. Wistman's Wood on Dartmoor, no doubt derives it name from its
 extraordinary character. Carrington, in his "Dartmoor," well describes its
 oaks:-- </p>
 <p>But of this grove,<br>
 This pigmy grove, not one baa dimb'd the air,<br>
 So emulously that its loftiest branch<br>
 May brush the traveller's brow. The twisted roots<br>
 Have clasp'd, in search of nourishment, the rocks,<br>
 And straggled wide, and pierced the stony soil? "Around the boughs<br>
 Hoary and feebly, and around the trunks<br>
 With grasp destructive feeding on the life<br>
 That lingers yet, the ivy winds, and moss<br>
 Of growth.enormous."</p>
