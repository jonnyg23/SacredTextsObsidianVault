 <p align="CENTER">WOEFUL MOOR, AND BODRIGAN'S LEAP</p>
 <p align="CENTER">
 <b> </b>THE Bodrigans,
 from a very early period, were connected with the borough of Looe.
 Otto, or Otho de Bodrigan, was lord of the manor of Pendrim and Looe
 in the reign of 'Edward II. Another Otho de Bodrigan was sheriff of
 Cornwall in the third of Richard II., A.D. 1400.</p>
 <p>Sir Henry Bodrigan was "attaynted for taking part
 with King Richard III. against Henry VII. ; and, after flying into
 Ireland, Sir Richard Egecombe, father of Sir Pears Egecombe, had
 Bodrigan, and other parcels of Bodrigari's lands; and Trevanion had
 part of Bodrigan's lands, as Restronget and Newham, both in Falmouth
 Haven."</p>
 <p>On the Barton of Bodrigan there exists what are
 evidently the remains of ancient fortifications, and near them a piece
 of waste land known as the <i>Woeful Moor.</i></p>
 
 <p>Here Sir Henry Edgecombe and Trevanion defeated the
 great Bodrigan. He fled, and tradition preserves, on the side of the
 cliff, the spot known as Bodrigan's Leap, from which he leapt into the
 sea, and swam to a ship which kept near the shore. As he leapt the
 precipice, he bequeathed, with a curse, "his extravagance to the
 Trevanions, and his folly to the Edgecombes."</p>
 <p>These families divided between them an estate said 
 to be worth, in those days, £10,000 per annum.</p>
 <p>"At that period in our history when the law of the
 strongest was the rule, three families in Cornwall were engaged in a
 series of domestic wars; these were Bodrigan, Trevanion, and Edgecumbe.
 And when Richard the Third obtained sovereign power, on the division
 which then took place in the York faction, Bodrigan endeavoured to
 seize the property of Edgecumbe, with little respect, as it<b> </b>
 would seem, for the life of the possessor; but in the final struggle
 at Bosworth Field, where Henry Tudor put an entire end to this contest
 for power under the guise of property, by seizing the whole to
 himself, Trevanion and Edgecumbe had the good fortune to appear on the 
 winning side, and subsequently availed themselves to the utmost of
 belligerent rights against Bodrigan, as he had attempted to dQ before
 against them. The last of that family was driven from his home, and
 seems to have perished in exile. His property was divided between the
 two families opposed to him, and, after the lapse of three hundred and
 fifty years, continues to form a large portion of their respective
 posses<i>sions."--Gilbert, </i>vol iii., p. 204.</p>
 <p>William de Bodrigan was lord of the manor of
 Restronget, in the 12th<b> </b>of Henry IV. The family possessed it
 till the beginning of the reign of Henry VII., when, on the attainder
 of Bodrigan, it was given to William Trevanion. [a]</p>
