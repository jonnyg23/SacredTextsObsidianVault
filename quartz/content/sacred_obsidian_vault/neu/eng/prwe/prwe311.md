 <p align="CENTER">GOLDSITHNEY FAIR AND THE GLOVE</p>
 <p>ON the 5th of August, St James's day (old style), a
 fair is held here, which was originally held in the Church-town of
 Sithney near Helston.</p>
 <p>In olden time, the good <i>St</i> <i>Perran the
 Little </i>gave to the wrestlers in his parish a glove as the prize,
 and the winner of the glove was permitted to collect the market toll
 on the day of the feast, and to appropriate the money to his own use.
 The winner of the glove lived in the Church-town of Sithney, and for
 long long years the right of holding the fair remained undisputed.</p>
 <p>At length the miners of Goldsithney resolved to
 contest the prize, and they won it, since which time the fair has been
 held in that village, they paying to the poor of the parish of Sithney
 one shilling as compensation.</p>
 <p>Gilbert remarks "The displaying of a glove at fairs
 is an ancient and widely-extended custom. Mr Lysons says it is
 continued at Chester. The editor has seen a large ornamented glove
 over the guildhall at Exeter during the fairs." [a]</p>
