 <p align="CENTER">THE HARLYN PIE</p>
 <p>THE Peter family, who formerly lived at Harlyn, left
 the place, and sold the estate to a farmer. The common report was that
 one of the family manured his land with earth from the graves in
 Constantine churchyard.</p>
 <p>A considerable quantity of land formerly said to
 belong to the poor of the parish cannot now he found, as all the marks
 are gone.</p>
 <p>The gold collar deposited in the Royal Institution at
 Truro, by H.R.H., the Duke of Cornwall, was found on the Harlyn estate.</p>
