 <p align="CENTER">SHARA AND SHEELA.</p>
 <p>AFTER the meeting of the British Association at
 Cork, I spent some days visiting, with two friends, the various
 spots of interest in the south of Ireland. At Fermoy, the name given
 to a somewhat curious cromlech, "The Hag's Bed," interested me. I
 was at some trouble to learn the origin of the name, and fortunately
 our car-driver succeeded in finding an old man, who gave me the
 desired information. As there is some (although a remote) analogy
 between this legend and that of the Chapel Rock, I gave it as I
 heard it.</p>
 <p>"On yonder hill there lived, in days gone by, a giant
 and a giantess. They were called Shara and Sheela. One day Shara
 returned from his labours (wood-cutting) in the forest, and finding no
 dinner ready he was exceeding angry, and in his passion gave Sheela a
 severe wound with his axe on the shoulder. His passion was assuaged as
 soon as he saw the blood of his wife, and he carefully bound up the
 wound and nursed her for many weeks with great care. Sheela did not,
 however, forgive Shara for the injury he had inflicted on her. She
 brooded on her wrong. Eventually she was so far recovered that Shara was
 able to leave her; and their stock of wood having fallen short, he
 proceeded to the forest for a fresh supply. Sheela watched her husband
 as he descended the hill, and, full of wrath, she seized her bed, and,
 as he was wading through the river, she flung it after him with a
 dreadful imprecation. The devil changed the bed into stone in its
 passage through the air. It fell on the giant, crushed him, and to this
 day he rests beneath the Hag's Bed. In the solitude which she had made
 she repented her crime, but she never forgave herself the sin. She sat 
 on the hill-top, the melancholy monument of desolation, bewailing her
 husband's loss, and the country around echoed with her lamentations.
 "Bad as Shara was, it is worse to be without him !" was her constant
 cry. Eventually she died of excess of grief her last words being, "Bad
 as Shara was, it is worse to be without him !" "And," said the old man,
 finishing his story, "whenever any trouble is coming upon Ireland, the
 voice of Sheela is heard upon the hill still repeating her melancholy
 lamentation."</p>
