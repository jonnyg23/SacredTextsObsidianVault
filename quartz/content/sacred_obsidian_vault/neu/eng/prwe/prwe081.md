 <p align="CENTER">THE DEVIL'S COlTS, &amp;c.</p>
 <p><br>
 IN St Columb Major, not far from the ruins of what is generally considered to
 be a British fortification, Castele-an-Dinas, stands a tumulus known as the
 Devil's Coit. It is curious to find one tradition directly contradicting
 another. We are told, on the one hand, that--</p>
 <i>
 </i><p>The devil never came into Cornwall.</p>
 
 <p>Because, when he crossed the Tamar, and made Torpoint for a
 brief space his resting-place, he could not but observe that everything,
 vegetable or animal, was put by the Cornish people into a pie.</p>
 <p>He saw and heard of fishy pie, star-gazy pie, conger pie, and
 indeed pies of all the fishes in the sea. Of parsley pie, and herby pie, of
 lamy pie, and piggy pie, and pies without number. Therefore, fearing they
 might take a fancy to a "devily pie," he took himself back again into
 Devonshire.</p>
 <p>On the other hand we find, amidst the rocks of the shore and
 the hills, numerous devil's coits, plenty of devil's footsteps, with devil's
 bellows, devil's frying-pans, devil's ovens, and devil's caves in abundance.
 Of course, on Dartmoor, since the devil remained in Devonshire, we might
 expect to find such evidences of his presence. The devil's frying-pan at
 Mistor is well known, and nearly every granite Tor preserves some impression
 of this melancholy, wandering wicked one.</p>
