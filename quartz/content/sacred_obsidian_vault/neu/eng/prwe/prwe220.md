 <p align="CENTER">THE NORTH SIDE OF A CHURCH. [a]</p>
 <p>STRONG prejudice has long existed against burying on, the
 northern side of the church. In many churchyards the southern side will be
 found full of graves, with scarcely any on the northern side.</p>
 <p>I have sought to discover, if possible, the origin of
 this prejudice, but I have not been able to trace it to any well-defined
 feeling. I have been answered, "Oh, we like to bury a corpse where the sun
 will shine on the grave ;" and, "The northern graveyard is in the shadow,
 and cold ;" but beyond this I have not advanced.</p>
 <p>We may infer that this desire to place the remains of our
 friends in earth on which the sun shines, is born of that love which,
 forgetting mortality, lives on the pleasant 'memories of the past, hoping
 for that meeting beyond the grave which shall know no shadow. The act of
 planting flowers, of nurturing an evergreen tree, of hanging "eternals" on
 the tomb, is only another form of the same sacred feeling.</p>
