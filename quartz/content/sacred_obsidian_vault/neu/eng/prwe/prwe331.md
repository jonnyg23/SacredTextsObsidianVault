 <p align="CENTER">THE POEM OF THE WRESTLING*</p>
 <p>lt may be here remarked as something more than
 accidental, that Magog is a well.known Oriental giant, that Gog and
 Magog figure in the Guildhall of London, and that Gogmagog was the
 champion selected for a trial of strength with Corineus.</p>
 <p>"Amongst
 the ragged Cleeves those monstrous giants sought:</p>
 <p>Who (of
 their dreadful kind) t' appal the Trojans brought</p>
 <p>Great <i>
 Gogmagog, </i>an oake that by the roots could teare;</p>
 <p>So
 mighty were (that time) the men who lived there:</p>
 <p>But, for
 the use of armes he did not understand</p>
 <p>(Except
 some rock or tree, that coming next to hand,</p>
 <p>He
 raised out of the earth to execute his rage),</p>
 <p>He
 challenge makes for strength, and offereth there his gage,</p>
 <p>Which <i>
 Corin </i>taketh up, to answer by and by,</p>
 <p>Upon
 this sonne of earth his utmost power to try. <br>
 All, doubtful to which port the victory should goe,</p>
 <p>Upon
 that loftie place at <i>Plimmouth, </i>called the <i>Hoe,</i></p>
 
 <p>Those
 mightie wrastlers met with many an irefull looke,</p>
 <p>Who
 threat'ned as the one hold of the other tooke:</p>
 <p>But,
 grappled, glowing fire shines in their sparkling eyes,</p>
 <p>And,
 whilst at length of arme one from the other lyes,</p>
 <p>Their
 lusty sinewes swell like cables, as they strive.</p>
 <p>Their
 feet such trampling make, as though they forced to drive</p>
 <p>A
 thunder out of earth, which stagger'd with the weight:</p>
 <p>Thus
 either's utmost force urged to the greatest height.</p>
 <p>Whilst
 one upon his hips the other seeks to lift,</p>
 <p>And th'
 adverse (by a turn) doth from his cunning shift,</p>
 <p>Their
 short-fetcht troubled breath a hollow noise doth make,</p>
 <p>Like
 bellows of a forge. Their Corin up doth take</p>
 <p>The
 giant 'twixt the groins; and voiding of his hold</p>
 <p>(Before
 his cumbrous feet he well recover could),</p>
 <p>
 Pitcht headlong from the bill: as when a man doth throw</p>
 <p>An
 axtree. that with slight delivered from the toe</p>
 <p>Roots
 up the yielding earth, so that his violent fall,</p>
 <p>Shook
 Neptune with such strength as shoulder'd him withal</p>
 <p>That
 where the monstrous waves like mountains late did stand,</p>
 <p>They
 leapt out of the place, and left the bared sand</p>
 <p>To
 gaze upon wide heaven, so great a blow it gave.</p>
 <p>For
 which the conquering Brute on Corineus brave</p>
 <p>This
 horn of land bestow'd, and markt it with his name</p>
 <p>Of
 Corin, Cornwal call'd to his immortal fame." [a]</p>
 <p>In 1750 Robert Heath published his "Natural and
 Historical Account of the Islands of Scilly," to which was added "A General
 Account of Cornwall." From paragraphs in this work it may be inferred that
 the figures of the wrestlers cut out in the turf on Plymouth Hoe then
 existed.</p>
 <p>"The activity of the <i>Cornish</i> and <i>Devonshire</i>
 men, beyond others in the faculty of Wrestling, seems to derive their
 Pedigree from that grand Wrestler, Corineus. That there has been such a
 giant as Gogmagog, opposed by Corineus, the inhabitants of <i>Plymouth</i>
 show you a Portraiture of two Men, one bigger than the other, with Clubs in
 their hands, cut out upon the Raw-ground, which have been renewed by order
 of the Place, as they wear out; and a steep cliff being-near, over which the
 giant might be thrown, are said to point out together the Probability of the
 Fact."</p>
 <p>In the "Dissertation on the Cornish Tongue," by William
 Scawen, Vice-Warden of the Stannaries, we find the following passage : "I
 cannot affirm with so much reason, its some of our neighbours have done with
 confidence, who say that at the last digging on the Haw for the foundation
 of the citadel of Plymouth, the great jaws and teeth therein found were
 those of Gogmagog, who was there said to be thrown down by Corineus, whom
 some will have to be the founder of the Cornish; [b] nor am I able to assert
 that some instruments of war in brass, and huge limbs and por. traitures of
 persons long ago, as some say that have been in some of the western
 parishes, were parts of giants or other great men, who had formerly had
 their being there."</p>
 <p>[a] See also Hogg's "Records of
 Ancient Cornwall."<br>
 </p>
 <p>[b] <i>This note is by the Editor</i>,
 Mr. Davies Gilbert : "These bones must evidently have been found in a
 cavern, the nature of which has been most ably ascertained and described by
 Dr. Buckland and the Rev. Richard Hannah, who examined other caverns of
 precisely the same nature, comprising bones of various larger mammalia, in
 the limestone formation not far from Plymouth."</p>
 <p>Thus we see the poetical belief of
 one age destroyed by the positive philosophy of the next. Happily, we move
 in all things by waves; the system of undulations prevails in every
 operation, mental and physical. Amidst the relics of the mammalia of the
 Devonshire caves we are now discovering the unmistakable remains of man, and
 his works,--stone knives, spear-heads, axes, and hammers speak of an
 ancient race; and 'nay there not have been <i>
 "giants in the earth in those days, and also after that?"</i></p>
