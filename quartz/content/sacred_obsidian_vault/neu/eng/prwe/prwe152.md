 <p align="CENTER">RICKETY CHILDREN.</p>
 <p>THE practice of bathing rickety children on the first
 three, Wednesdays in May is still far from uncommon in the outlying
 districts of Cornwall. The parents will walk many miles for the purpose of
 dipping the little sufferers in some well, from which the "healing virtue"
 has not entirely departed. Among these holy wells, Cubert, just named, is
 far-famed. To this well the Peasantry still resort, firm in the faith that
 there, at this especial Season, some mysterious virtue is communicated to
