 <p align="CENTER">HOW MR LENINE GAVE UP COURTING.</p>
 <p>MR LENINE had been, as was his wont, spending his evening
 hours with the lady of his love. He was a timid man and always returned to
 Tregenebris early. Beyond this, as the lady was alone, she deemed it prudent
 to let the world know that Mr Lenine left her by daylight.</p>
 <p>One evening, it was scarcely yet dark, and our lover was
 re turning home through Leah Lanes. His horse started at an an woman, who
 had crept under the hedge for shelter from a passing shower. As Mr Lenine
 saw a figure moving in the shade he was terrified.</p>
 <p>"Tu-whit, tu-whoo, ho," sang an owl.</p>
 <p>"It's only me--Mr Lenine of Tregenebris," said he,
 putting the spurs to his horse.</p>
 <p>Something followed him, fast as he might go, and he force
 his horse up the hill by Leak vean.</p>
 <p>"Tu-whit, tu-whoo, ho," sang the owl.</p>
 <p>"It 's only me--Aunt Betty Foss," screamed the old
 woman.</p>
 <p>"Tu-whit, tu-whoo, ho, ho," sang the owl again.</p>
 <p>"Don't ye be afeared, Mr Lenine," shrieked Aunt Betty,
 almost out of breath.</p>
 <p>"Tu-whit, tu-whoo, ho, ho, ho," also shrieked the owl.</p>
 <p>"Oh, it 's only John Lenine of Tregenebris," stammered
 the frightened lover, who had, however, reached home.</p>
 <p>He went no more a-courting. He was fully persuaded that
 either a highwayman and his crew, or the devil and his imps, were upon him.
 He died a bachelor, and the charming lady became a peevish old maid, and
 died in solitude; all owing to the hooting owl.</p>
 <p>Some do say Betty Foss was a witch, and the owl her
 familiar.</p>
