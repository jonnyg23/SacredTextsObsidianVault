 <p align="CENTER">THE SUICIDE'S GHOST.</p>
 <p>ON the bleak road between Helston and Wendron
 Church-town, at its highest and wildest spot, three roads meet about a
 quarter of a mile from the latter place. Here, at "Three Cross," as the
 place is called, years ago, when the Downs being unenclosed, it was more
 desolate than it is even now, a poor suicide, named "Tucker," was buried.
 Few liked to pass up Row's Lane, leading there, after nightfall; for
 Tucker's shade had more than once been seen. One man, however, valiant in
 his cups, on his return from Helston market, cracked his whip, and shouted
 lustily, "Arise, Tucker!" as he passed the place. It is said Tucker did
 arise, and fixed himself on the saddle behind the man as he rode on
 horseback, and accompanied him--how far it is not said. This was often
 repeated, until the spirit, becoming angry, refused any more to quit his
 disturber, and continued to trouble him, till "Parson Jago" was called in to
 use his skill, which was found effectual, in "laying" Tucker's spirit to
 rest.</p>
