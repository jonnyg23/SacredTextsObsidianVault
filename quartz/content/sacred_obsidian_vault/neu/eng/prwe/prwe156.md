 <p align="CENTER">HOLY WELL AT LITTLE CONAN</p>
 <p>ON Palm Sunday the people resorted to the well sacred to
 "Our Lady of Nants," with a cross of palm, and after making the priest a
 present, they' were allowed to throw the cross into the well; if it swam the
 thrower was to outlive the year, if sank he was not. [a]</p>
