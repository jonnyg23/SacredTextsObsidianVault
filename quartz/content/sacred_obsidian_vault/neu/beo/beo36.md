 'TWAS now, men say, in his sovran's need<br>
 that the earl made known his noble strain,<br>
 craft and keenness and courage enduring.<br>
 Heedless of harm, though his hand was burned,<br>
 hardy-hearted, he helped his kinsman.<br>
 A little lower the loathsome beast<br>
 he smote with sword; his steel drove in<br>
 bright and burnished; that blaze began<br>
 to lose and lessen. At last the king<br>
 wielded his wits again, war-knife drew,<br>
 a biting blade by his breastplate hanging,<br>
 and the Weders'-helm smote that worm asunder,<br>
 felled the foe, flung forth its life.<br>
 So had they killed it, kinsmen both,<br>
 athelings twain: thus an earl should be<br>
 in danger's day! -- Of deeds of valor<br>
 this conqueror's-hour of the king was last,<br>
 of his work in the world. The wound began,<br>
 which that dragon-of-earth had erst inflicted,<br>
 to swell and smart; and soon he found<br>
 in his breast was boiling, baleful and deep,<br>
 pain of poison. The prince walked on,<br>
 wise in his thought, to the wall of rock;<br>
 then sat, and stared at the structure of giants,<br>
 where arch of stone and steadfast column<br>
 upheld forever that hall in earth.<br>
 Yet here must the hand of the henchman peerless<br>
 lave with water his winsome lord,<br>
 the king and conqueror covered with blood,<br>
 with struggle spent, and unspan his helmet.<br>
 Beowulf spake in spite of his hurt,<br>
 his mortal wound; full well he knew<br>
 his portion now was past and gone<br>
 of earthly bliss, and all had fled<br>
 of his file of days, and death was near:<br>
 "I would fain bestow on son of mine<br>
 this gear of war, were given me now<br>
 that any heir should after me come<br>
 of my proper blood. This people I ruled<br>
 fifty winters. No folk-king was there,<br>
 none at all, of the neighboring clans<br>
 who war would wage me with 'warriors'-friends'[1]<br>
 and threat me with horrors. At home I bided<br>
 what fate might come, and I cared for mine own;<br>
 feuds I sought not, nor falsely swore<br>
 ever on oath. For all these things,<br>
 though fatally wounded, fain am I!<br>
 From the Ruler-of-Man no wrath shall seize me,<br>
 when life from my frame must flee away,<br>
 for killing of kinsmen! Now quickly go<br>
 and gaze on that hoard 'neath the hoary rock,<br>
 Wiglaf loved, now the worm lies low,<br>
 sleeps, heart-sore, of his spoil bereaved.<br>
 And fare in haste. I would fain behold<br>
 the gorgeous heirlooms, golden store,<br>
 have joy in the jewels and gems, lay down<br>
 softlier for sight of this splendid hoard<br>
 my life and the lordship I long have held."<br>
