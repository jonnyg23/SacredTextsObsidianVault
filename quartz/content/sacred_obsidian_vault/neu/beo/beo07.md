 HROTHGAR answered, helmet of Scyldings:--<br>
 "I knew him of yore in his youthful days;<br>
 his aged father was Ecgtheow named,<br>
 to whom, at home, gave Hrethel the Geat<br>
 his only daughter. Their offspring bold<br>
 fares hither to seek the steadfast friend.<br>
 And seamen, too, have said me this, --<br>
 who carried my gifts to the Geatish court,<br>
 thither for thanks, -- he has thirty men's<br>
 heft of grasp in the gripe of his hand,<br>
 the bold-in-battle. Blessed God<br>
 out of his mercy this man hath sent<br>
 to Danes of the West, as I ween indeed,<br>
 against horror of Grendel. I hope to give<br>
 the good youth gold for his gallant thought.<br>
 Be thou in haste, and bid them hither,<br>
 clan of kinsmen, to come before me;<br>
 and add this word, -- they are welcome guests<br>
 to folk of the Danes."<br>
 [To the door of the hall<br>
 Wulfgar went] and the word declared:--<br>
 "To you this message my master sends,<br>
 East-Danes' king, that your kin he knows,<br>
 hardy heroes, and hails you all<br>
 welcome hither o'er waves of the sea!<br>
 Ye may wend your way in war-attire,<br>
 and under helmets Hrothgar greet;<br>
 but let here the battle-shields bide your parley,<br>
 and wooden war-shafts wait its end."<br>
 Uprose the mighty one, ringed with his men,<br>
 brave band of thanes: some bode without,<br>
 battle-gear guarding, as bade the chief.<br>
 Then hied that troop where the herald led them,<br>
 under Heorot's roof: [the hero strode,]<br>
 hardy 'neath helm, till the hearth he neared.<br>
 Beowulf spake, -- his breastplate gleamed,<br>
 war-net woven by wit of the smith:--<br>
 "Thou Hrothgar, hail! Hygelac's I,<br>
 kinsman and follower. Fame a plenty<br>
 have I gained in youth! These Grendel-deeds<br>
 I heard in my home-land heralded clear.<br>
 Seafarers say how stands this hall,<br>
 of buildings best, for your band of thanes<br>
 empty and idle, when evening sun<br>
 in the harbor of heaven is hidden away.<br>
 So my vassals advised me well, --<br>
 brave and wise, the best of men, --<br>
 O sovran Hrothgar, to seek thee here,<br>
 for my nerve and my might they knew full well.<br>
 Themselves had seen me from slaughter come<br>
 blood-flecked from foes, where five I bound,<br>
 and that wild brood worsted. I' the waves I slew<br>
 nicors[1] by night, in need and peril<br>
 avenging the Weders,[2] whose woe they sought, --<br>
 crushing the grim ones. Grendel now,<br>
 monster cruel, be mine to quell<br>
 in single battle! So, from thee,<br>
 thou sovran of the Shining-Danes,<br>
 Scyldings'-bulwark, a boon I seek, --<br>
 and, Friend-of-the-folk, refuse it not,<br>
 O Warriors'-shield, now I've wandered far, --<br>
 that I alone with my liegemen here,<br>
 this hardy band, may Heorot purge!<br>
 More I hear, that the monster dire,<br>
 in his wanton mood, of weapons recks not;<br>
 hence shall I scorn -- so Hygelac stay,<br>
 king of my kindred, kind to me! --<br>
 brand or buckler to bear in the fight,<br>
 gold-colored targe: but with gripe alone<br>
 must I front the fiend and fight for life,<br>
 foe against foe. Then faith be his<br>
 in the doom of the Lord whom death shall take.<br>
 Fain, I ween, if the fight he win,<br>
 in this hall of gold my Geatish band<br>
 will he fearless eat, -- as oft before, --<br>
 my noblest thanes. Nor need'st thou then<br>
 to hide my head;[3] for his shall I be,<br>
 dyed in gore, if death must take me;<br>
 and my blood-covered body he'll bear as prey,<br>
 ruthless devour it, the roamer-lonely,<br>
 with my life-blood redden his lair in the fen:<br>
 no further for me need'st food prepare!<br>
 To Hygelac send, if Hild[4] should take me,<br>
 best of war-weeds, warding my breast,<br>
 armor excellent, heirloom of Hrethel<br>
 and work of Wayland.[5] Fares Wyrd[6] as she must."<br>
 
 [1] The nicor, says Bugge, is a hippopotamus; a walrus, says ten Brink.
 But that water-goblin who covers the space from Old Nick of jest to the
 Neckan and Nix of poetry and tale, is all one needs, and Nicor is a good
 name for him.<br>
 [2] His own people, the Geats.<br>
 [3] That is, cover it as with a face-cloth. "There will be no need of
 funeral rites."<br>
 [4] Personification of Battle.<br>
 [5] The Germanic Vulcan.<br>
 [6] This mighty power, whom the Christian poet can still revere, has here
 the general force of "Destiny."<br>
