 HROTHGAR spake, helmet-of-Scyldings:--<br>
 "Ask not of pleasure! Pain is renewed<br>
 to Danish folk. Dead is Aeschere,<br>
 of Yrmenlaf the elder brother,<br>
 my sage adviser and stay in council,<br>
 shoulder-comrade in stress of fight<br>
 when warriors clashed and we warded our heads,<br>
 hewed the helm-boars; hero famed<br>
 should be every earl as Aeschere was!<br>
 But here in Heorot a hand hath slain him<br>
 of wandering death-sprite. I wot not whither,[1]<br>
 proud of the prey, her path she took,<br>
 fain of her fill. The feud she avenged<br>
 that yesternight, unyieldingly,<br>
 Grendel in grimmest grasp thou killedst, --<br>
 seeing how long these liegemen mine<br>
 he ruined and ravaged. Reft of life,<br>
 in arms he fell. Now another comes,<br>
 keen and cruel, her kin to avenge,<br>
 faring far in feud of blood:<br>
 so that many a thane shall think, who e'er<br>
 sorrows in soul for that sharer of rings,<br>
 this is hardest of heart-bales. The hand lies low<br>
 that once was willing each wish to please.<br>
 Land-dwellers here[2] and liegemen mine,<br>
 who house by those parts, I have heard relate<br>
 that such a pair they have sometimes seen,<br>
 march-stalkers mighty the moorland haunting,<br>
 wandering spirits: one of them seemed,<br>
 so far as my folk could fairly judge,<br>
 of womankind; and one, accursed,<br>
 in man's guise trod the misery-track<br>
 of exile, though huger than human bulk.<br>
 Grendel in days long gone they named him,<br>
 folk of the land; his father they knew not,<br>
 nor any brood that was born to him<br>
 of treacherous spirits. Untrod is their home;<br>
 by wolf-cliffs haunt they and windy headlands,<br>
 fenways fearful, where flows the stream<br>
 from mountains gliding to gloom of the rocks,<br>
 underground flood. Not far is it hence<br>
 in measure of miles that the mere expands,<br>
 and o'er it the frost-bound forest hanging,<br>
 sturdily rooted, shadows the wave.<br>
 By night is a wonder weird to see,<br>
 fire on the waters. So wise lived none<br>
 of the sons of men, to search those depths!<br>
 Nay, though the heath-rover, harried by dogs,<br>
 the horn-proud hart, this holt should seek,<br>
 long distance driven, his dear life first<br>
 on the brink he yields ere he brave the plunge<br>
 to hide his head: 'tis no happy place!<br>
 Thence the welter of waters washes up<br>
 wan to welkin when winds bestir<br>
 evil storms, and air grows dusk,<br>
 and the heavens weep. Now is help once more<br>
 with thee alone! The land thou knowst not,<br>
 place of fear, where thou findest out<br>
 that sin-flecked being. Seek if thou dare!<br>
 I will reward thee, for waging this fight,<br>
 with ancient treasure, as erst I did,<br>
 with winding gold, if thou winnest back."<br>
 
 [1] He surmises presently where she is.<br>
 [2] The connection is not difficult. The words of mourning, of acute grief,
 are said; and according to Germanic sequence of thought, inexorable here,
 the next and only topic is revenge. But is it possible? Hrothgar leads up
 to his appeal and promise with a skillful and often effective description of
 the horrors which surround the monster's home and await the attempt of
 an avenging foe.<br>
