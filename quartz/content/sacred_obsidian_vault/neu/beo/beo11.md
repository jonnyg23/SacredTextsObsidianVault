 THEN Hrothgar went with his hero-train,<br>
 defence-of-Scyldings, forth from hall;<br>
 fain would the war-lord Wealhtheow seek,<br>
 couch of his queen. The King-of-Glory<br>
 against this Grendel a guard had set,<br>
 so heroes heard, a hall-defender,<br>
 who warded the monarch and watched for the monster.<br>
 In truth, the Geats' prince gladly trusted<br>
 his mettle, his might, the mercy of God!<br>
 Cast off then his corselet of iron,<br>
 helmet from head; to his henchman gave, --<br>
 choicest of weapons, -- the well-chased sword,<br>
 bidding him guard the gear of battle.<br>
 Spake then his Vaunt the valiant man,<br>
 Beowulf Geat, ere the bed be sought:--<br>
 "Of force in fight no feebler I count me,<br>
 in grim war-deeds, than Grendel deems him.<br>
 Not with the sword, then, to sleep of death<br>
 his life will I give, though it lie in my power.<br>
 No skill is his to strike against me,<br>
 my shield to hew though he hardy be,<br>
 bold in battle; we both, this night,<br>
 shall spurn the sword, if he seek me here,<br>
 unweaponed, for war. Let wisest God,<br>
 sacred Lord, on which side soever<br>
 doom decree as he deemeth right."<br>
 Reclined then the chieftain, and cheek-pillows held<br>
 the head of the earl, while all about him<br>
 seamen hardy on hall-beds sank.<br>
 None of them thought that thence their steps<br>
 to the folk and fastness that fostered them,<br>
 to the land they loved, would lead them back!<br>
 Full well they wist that on warriors many<br>
 battle-death seized, in the banquet-hall,<br>
 of Danish clan. But comfort and help,<br>
 war-weal weaving, to Weder folk<br>
 the Master gave, that, by might of one,<br>
 over their enemy all prevailed,<br>
 by single strength. In sooth 'tis told<br>
 that highest God o'er human kind<br>
 hath wielded ever! -- Thro' wan night striding,<br>
 came the walker-in-shadow. Warriors slept<br>
 whose hest was to guard the gabled hall, --<br>
 all save one. 'Twas widely known<br>
 that against God's will the ghostly ravager<br>
 him[1] could not hurl to haunts of darkness;<br>
 wakeful, ready, with warrior's wrath,<br>
 bold he bided the battle's issue.<br>
 
 [1] Beowulf, -- the "one."<br>
