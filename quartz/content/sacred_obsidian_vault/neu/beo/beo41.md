 <h1 align="CENTER">XLII</h1>
 A PERILOUS path, it proved, he[1] trod<br>
 who heinously hid, that hall within,<br>
 wealth under wall! Its watcher had killed<br>
 one of a few,[2] and the feud was avenged<br>
 in woful fashion. Wondrous seems it,<br>
 what manner a man of might and valor<br>
 oft ends his life, when the earl no longer<br>
 in mead-hall may live with loving friends.<br>
 So Beowulf, when that barrow's warden<br>
 he sought, and the struggle; himself knew not<br>
 in what wise he should wend from the world at last.<br>
 For[3] princes potent, who placed the gold,<br>
 with a curse to doomsday covered it deep,<br>
 so that marked with sin the man should be,<br>
 hedged with horrors, in hell-bonds fast,<br>
 racked with plagues, who should rob their hoard.<br>
 Yet no greed for gold, but the grace of heaven,<br>
 ever the king had kept in view.[4]<br>
 Wiglaf spake, the son of Weohstan:--<br>
 "At the mandate of one, oft warriors many<br>
 sorrow must suffer; and so must we.<br>
 The people's-shepherd showed not aught<br>
 of care for our counsel, king beloved!<br>
 That guardian of gold he should grapple not, urged we,<br>
 but let him lie where he long had been<br>
 in his earth-hall waiting the end of the world,<br>
 the hest of heaven. -- This hoard is ours<br>
 but grievously gotten; too grim the fate<br>
 which thither carried our king and lord.<br>
 I was within there, and all I viewed,<br>
 the chambered treasure, when chance allowed me<br>
 (and my path was made in no pleasant wise)<br>
 under the earth-wall. Eager, I seized<br>
 such heap from the hoard as hands could bear<br>
 and hurriedly carried it hither back<br>
 to my liege and lord. Alive was he still,<br>
 still wielding his wits. The wise old man<br>
 spake much in his sorrow, and sent you greetings<br>
 and bade that ye build, when he breathed no more,<br>
 on the place of his balefire a barrow high,<br>
 memorial mighty. Of men was he<br>
 worthiest warrior wide earth o'er<br>
 the while he had joy of his jewels and burg.<br>
 Let us set out in haste now, the second time<br>
 to see and search this store of treasure,<br>
 these wall-hid wonders, -- the way I show you, --<br>
 where, gathered near, ye may gaze your fill<br>
 at broad-gold and rings. Let the bier, soon made,<br>
 be all in order when out we come,<br>
 our king and captain to carry thither<br>
 -- man beloved -- where long he shall bide<br>
 safe in the shelter of sovran God."<br>
 Then the bairn of Weohstan bade command,<br>
 hardy chief, to heroes many<br>
 that owned their homesteads, hither to bring<br>
 firewood from far -- o'er the folk they ruled --<br>
 for the famed-one's funeral. " Fire shall devour<br>
 and wan flames feed on the fearless warrior<br>
 who oft stood stout in the iron-shower,<br>
 when, sped from the string, a storm of arrows<br>
 shot o'er the shield-wall: the shaft held firm,<br>
 featly feathered, followed the barb."<br>
 And now the sage young son of Weohstan<br>
 seven chose of the chieftain's thanes,<br>
 the best he found that band within,<br>
 and went with these warriors, one of eight,<br>
 under hostile roof. In hand one bore<br>
 a lighted torch and led the way.<br>
 No lots they cast for keeping the hoard<br>
 when once the warriors saw it in hall,<br>
 altogether without a guardian,<br>
 lying there lost. And little they mourned<br>
 when they had hastily haled it out,<br>
 dear-bought treasure! The dragon they cast,<br>
 the worm, o'er the wall for the wave to take,<br>
 and surges swallowed that shepherd of gems.<br>
 Then the woven gold on a wain was laden --<br>
 countless quite! -- and the king was borne,<br>
 hoary hero, to Hrones-Ness.<br>
 
 [1] Probably the fugitive is meant who discovered the hoard. Ten Brink
 and Gering assume that the dragon is meant. "Hid" may well mean here
 "took while in hiding."<br>
 [2] That is "one and a few others." But Beowulf seems to be indicated.<br>
 [3] Ten Brink points out the strongly heathen character of this part of the
 epic. Beowulf's end came, so the old tradition ran, from his unwitting
 interference with spell-bound treasure.<br>
 [4] A hard saying, variously interpreted. In any case, it is the somewhat clumsy effort of the Christian poet to tone down the heathenism of
 his material by an edifying observation.<br>
