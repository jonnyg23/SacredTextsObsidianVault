 HROTHGAR spake, -- to the hall he went,<br>
 stood by the steps, the steep roof saw,<br>
 garnished with gold, and Grendel's hand:--<br>
 "For the sight I see to the Sovran Ruler<br>
 be speedy thanks! A throng of sorrows<br>
 I have borne from Grendel; but God still works<br>
 wonder on wonder, the Warden-of-Glory.<br>
 It was but now that I never more<br>
 for woes that weighed on me waited help<br>
 long as I lived, when, laved in blood,<br>
 stood sword-gore-stained this stateliest house, --<br>
 widespread woe for wise men all,<br>
 who had no hope to hinder ever<br>
 foes infernal and fiendish sprites<br>
 from havoc in hall. This hero now,<br>
 by the Wielder's might, a work has done<br>
 that not all of us erst could ever do<br>
 by wile and wisdom. Lo, well can she say<br>
 whoso of women this warrior bore<br>
 among sons of men, if still she liveth,<br>
 that the God of the ages was good to her<br>
 in the birth of her bairn. Now, Beowulf, thee,<br>
 of heroes best, I shall heartily love<br>
 as mine own, my son; preserve thou ever<br>
 this kinship new: thou shalt never lack<br>
 wealth of the world that I wield as mine!<br>
 Full oft for less have I largess showered,<br>
 my precious hoard, on a punier man,<br>
 less stout in struggle. Thyself hast now<br>
 fulfilled such deeds, that thy fame shall endure<br>
 through all the ages. As ever he did,<br>
 well may the Wielder reward thee still!"<br>
 Beowulf spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:--<br>
 "This work of war most willingly<br>
 we have fought, this fight, and fearlessly dared<br>
 force of the foe. Fain, too, were I<br>
 hadst thou but seen himself, what time<br>
 the fiend in his trappings tottered to fall!<br>
 Swiftly, I thought, in strongest gripe<br>
 on his bed of death to bind him down,<br>
 that he in the hent of this hand of mine<br>
 should breathe his last: but he broke away.<br>
 Him I might not -- the Maker willed not --<br>
 hinder from flight, and firm enough hold<br>
 the life-destroyer: too sturdy was he,<br>
 the ruthless, in running! For rescue, however,<br>
 he left behind him his hand in pledge,<br>
 arm and shoulder; nor aught of help<br>
 could the cursed one thus procure at all.<br>
 None the longer liveth he, loathsome fiend,<br>
 sunk in his sins, but sorrow holds him<br>
 tightly grasped in gripe of anguish,<br>
 in baleful bonds, where bide he must,<br>
 evil outlaw, such awful doom<br>
 as the Mighty Maker shall mete him out."<br>
 More silent seemed the son of Ecglaf[1]<br>
 in boastful speech of his battle-deeds,<br>
 since athelings all, through the earl's great prowess,<br>
 beheld that hand, on the high roof gazing,<br>
 foeman's fingers, -- the forepart of each<br>
 of the sturdy nails to steel was likest, --<br>
 heathen's "hand-spear," hostile warrior's<br>
 claw uncanny. 'Twas clear, they said,<br>
 that him no blade of the brave could touch,<br>
 how keen soever, or cut away<br>
 that battle-hand bloody from baneful foe.<br>
