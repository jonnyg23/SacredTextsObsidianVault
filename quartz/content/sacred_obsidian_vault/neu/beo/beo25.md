 BEOWULF spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:--<br>
 "Lo, now, this sea-booty, son of Healfdene,<br>
 Lord of Scyldings, we've lustily brought thee,<br>
 sign of glory; thou seest it here.<br>
 Not lightly did I with my life escape!<br>
 In war under water this work I essayed<br>
 with endless effort; and even so<br>
 my strength had been lost had the Lord not shielded me.<br>
 Not a whit could I with Hrunting do<br>
 in work of war, though the weapon is good;<br>
 yet a sword the Sovran of Men vouchsafed me<br>
 to spy on the wall there, in splendor hanging,<br>
 old, gigantic, -- how oft He guides<br>
 the friendless wight! -- and I fought with that brand,<br>
 felling in fight, since fate was with me,<br>
 the house's wardens. That war-sword then<br>
 all burned, bright blade, when the blood gushed o'er it,<br>
 battle-sweat hot; but the hilt I brought back<br>
 from my foes. So avenged I their fiendish deeds<br>
 death-fall of Danes, as was due and right.<br>
 And this is my hest, that in Heorot now<br>
 safe thou canst sleep with thy soldier band,<br>
 and every thane of all thy folk<br>
 both old and young; no evil fear,<br>
 Scyldings' lord, from that side again,<br>
 aught ill for thy earls, as erst thou must!"<br>
 Then the golden hilt, for that gray-haired leader,<br>
 hoary hero, in hand was laid,<br>
 giant-wrought, old. So owned and enjoyed it<br>
 after downfall of devils, the Danish lord,<br>
 wonder-smiths' work, since the world was rid<br>
 of that grim-souled fiend, the foe of God,<br>
 murder-marked, and his mother as well.<br>
 Now it passed into power of the people's king,<br>
 best of all that the oceans bound<br>
 who have scattered their gold o'er Scandia's isle.<br>
 Hrothgar spake -- the hilt he viewed,<br>
 heirloom old, where was etched the rise<br>
 of that far-off fight when the floods o'erwhelmed,<br>
 raging waves, the race of giants<br>
 (fearful their fate!), a folk estranged<br>
 from God Eternal: whence guerdon due<br>
 in that waste of waters the Wielder paid them.<br>
 So on the guard of shining gold<br>
 in runic staves it was rightly said<br>
 for whom the serpent-traced sword was wrought,<br>
 best of blades, in bygone days,<br>
 and the hilt well wound. -- The wise-one spake,<br>
 son of Healfdene; silent were all:--<br>
 "Lo, so may he say who sooth and right<br>
 follows 'mid folk, of far times mindful,<br>
 a land-warden old,[1] that this earl belongs<br>
 to the better breed! So, borne aloft,<br>
 thy fame must fly, O friend my Beowulf,<br>
 far and wide o'er folksteads many. Firmly thou<br>
 shalt all maintain,<br>
 mighty strength with mood of wisdom. Love of<br>
 mine will I assure thee,<br>
 as, awhile ago, I promised; thou shalt prove a stay in future,<br>
 in far-off years, to folk of thine,<br>
 to the heroes a help. Was not Heremod thus<br>
 to offspring of Ecgwela, Honor-Scyldings,<br>
 nor grew for their grace, but for grisly slaughter,<br>
 for doom of death to the Danishmen.<br>
 He slew, wrath-swollen, his shoulder-comrades,<br>
 companions at board! So he passed alone,<br>
 chieftain haughty, from human cheer.<br>
 Though him the Maker with might endowed,<br>
 delights of power, and uplifted high<br>
 above all men, yet blood-fierce his mind,<br>
 his breast-hoard, grew, no bracelets gave he<br>
 to Danes as was due; he endured all joyless<br>
 strain of struggle and stress of woe,<br>
 long feud with his folk. Here find thy lesson!<br>
 Of virtue advise thee! This verse I have said for thee,<br>
 wise from lapsed winters. Wondrous seems<br>
 how to sons of men Almighty God<br>
 in the strength of His spirit sendeth wisdom,<br>
 estate, high station: He swayeth all things.<br>
 Whiles He letteth right lustily fare<br>
 the heart of the hero of high-born race, --<br>
 in seat ancestral assigns him bliss,<br>
 his folk's sure fortress in fee to hold,<br>
 puts in his power great parts of the earth,<br>
 empire so ample, that end of it<br>
 this wanter-of-wisdom weeneth none.<br>
 So he waxes in wealth, nowise can harm him<br>
 illness or age; no evil cares<br>
 shadow his spirit; no sword-hate threatens<br>
 from ever an enemy: all the world<br>
 wends at his will, no worse he knoweth,<br>
 till all within him obstinate pride<br>
 waxes and wakes while the warden slumbers,<br>
 the spirit's sentry; sleep is too fast<br>
 which masters his might, and the murderer nears,<br>
 stealthily shooting the shafts from his bow!<br>
 
 [1] That is, "whoever has as wide authority as I have and can remember
 so far back so many instances of heroism, may well say, as I say, that no
 better hero ever lived than Beowulf."<br>
