 STONE-BRIGHT the street:[1] it showed the way<br>
 to the crowd of clansmen. Corselets glistened<br>
 hand-forged, hard; on their harness bright<br>
 the steel ring sang, as they strode along<br>
 in mail of battle, and marched to the hall.<br>
 There, weary of ocean, the wall along<br>
 they set their bucklers, their broad shields, down,<br>
 and bowed them to bench: the breastplates clanged,<br>
 war-gear of men; their weapons stacked,<br>
 spears of the seafarers stood together,<br>
 gray-tipped ash: that iron band<br>
 was worthily weaponed! -- A warrior proud<br>
 asked of the heroes their home and kin.<br>
 "Whence, now, bear ye burnished shields,<br>
 harness gray and helmets grim,<br>
 spears in multitude? Messenger, I,<br>
 Hrothgar's herald! Heroes so many<br>
 ne'er met I as strangers of mood so strong.<br>
 'Tis plain that for prowess, not plunged into exile,<br>
 for high-hearted valor, Hrothgar ye seek!"<br>
 Him the sturdy-in-war bespake with words,<br>
 proud earl of the Weders answer made,<br>
 hardy 'neath helmet:--"Hygelac's, we,<br>
 fellows at board; I am Beowulf named.<br>
 I am seeking to say to the son of Healfdene<br>
 this mission of mine, to thy master-lord,<br>
 the doughty prince, if he deign at all<br>
 grace that we greet him, the good one, now."<br>
 Wulfgar spake, the Wendles' chieftain,<br>
 whose might of mind to many was known,<br>
 his courage and counsel: "The king of Danes,<br>
 the Scyldings' friend, I fain will tell,<br>
 the Breaker-of-Rings, as the boon thou askest,<br>
 the famed prince, of thy faring hither,<br>
 and, swiftly after, such answer bring<br>
 as the doughty monarch may deign to give."<br>
 Hied then in haste to where Hrothgar sat<br>
 white-haired and old, his earls about him,<br>
 till the stout thane stood at the shoulder there<br>
 of the Danish king: good courtier he!<br>
 Wulfgar spake to his winsome lord:--<br>
 "Hither have fared to thee far-come men<br>
 o'er the paths of ocean, people of Geatland;<br>
 and the stateliest there by his sturdy band<br>
 is Beowulf named. This boon they seek,<br>
 that they, my master, may with thee<br>
 have speech at will: nor spurn their prayer<br>
 to give them hearing, gracious Hrothgar!<br>
 In weeds of the warrior worthy they,<br>
 methinks, of our liking; their leader most surely,<br>
 a hero that hither his henchmen has led."<br>
 
 [1] Either merely paved, the strata via of the Romans, or else thought of
 as a sort of mosaic, an extravagant touch like the reckless waste of gold
 on the walls and roofs of a hall.<br>
