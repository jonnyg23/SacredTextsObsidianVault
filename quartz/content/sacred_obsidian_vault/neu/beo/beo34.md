 "THEN he goes to his chamber, a grief-song chants<br>
 alone for his lost. Too large all seems,<br>
 homestead and house. So the helmet-of-Weders<br>
 hid in his heart for Herebeald<br>
 waves of woe. No way could he take<br>
 to avenge on the slayer slaughter so foul;<br>
 nor e'en could he harass that hero at all<br>
 with loathing deed, though he loved him not.<br>
 And so for the sorrow his soul endured,<br>
 men's gladness he gave up and God's light chose.<br>
 Lands and cities he left his sons<br>
 (as the wealthy do) when he went from earth.<br>
 There was strife and struggle 'twixt Swede and Geat<br>
 o'er the width of waters; war arose,<br>
 hard battle-horror, when Hrethel died,<br>
 and Ongentheow's offspring grew<br>
 strife-keen, bold, nor brooked o'er the seas<br>
 pact of peace, but pushed their hosts<br>
 to harass in hatred by Hreosnabeorh.<br>
 Men of my folk for that feud had vengeance,<br>
 for woful war ('tis widely known),<br>
 though one of them bought it with blood of his heart,<br>
 a bargain hard: for Haethcyn proved<br>
 fatal that fray, for the first-of-Geats.<br>
 At morn, I heard, was the murderer killed<br>
 by kinsman for kinsman,[1] with clash of sword,<br>
 when Ongentheow met Eofor there.<br>
 Wide split the war-helm: wan he fell,<br>
 hoary Scylfing; the hand that smote him<br>
 of feud was mindful, nor flinched from the death-blow.<br>
 -- "For all that he[2] gave me, my gleaming sword<br>
 repaid him at war, -- such power I wielded, --<br>
 for lordly treasure: with land he entrusted me,<br>
 homestead and house. He had no need<br>
 from Swedish realm, or from Spear-Dane folk,<br>
 or from men of the Gifths, to get him help, --<br>
 some warrior worse for wage to buy!<br>
 Ever I fought in the front of all,<br>
 sole to the fore; and so shall I fight<br>
 while I bide in life and this blade shall last<br>
 that early and late hath loyal proved<br>
 since for my doughtiness Daeghrefn fell,<br>
 slain by my hand, the Hugas' champion.<br>
 Nor fared he thence to the Frisian king<br>
 with the booty back, and breast-adornments;<br>
 but, slain in struggle, that standard-bearer<br>
 fell, atheling brave. Not with blade was he slain,<br>
 but his bones were broken by brawny gripe,<br>
 his heart-waves stilled. -- The sword-edge now,<br>
 hard blade and my hand, for the hoard shall strive."<br>
 Beowulf spake, and a battle-vow made<br>
 his last of all: "I have lived through many<br>
 wars in my youth; now once again,<br>
 old folk-defender, feud will I seek,<br>
 do doughty deeds, if the dark destroyer<br>
 forth from his cavern come to fight me!"<br>
 Then hailed he the helmeted heroes all,<br>
 for the last time greeting his liegemen dear,<br>
 comrades of war: "I should carry no weapon,<br>
 no sword to the serpent, if sure I knew<br>
 how, with such enemy, else my vows<br>
 I could gain as I did in Grendel's day.<br>
 But fire in this fight I must fear me now,<br>
 and poisonous breath; so I bring with me<br>
 breastplate and board.[3] From the barrow's keeper<br>
 no footbreadth flee I. One fight shall end<br>
 our war by the wall, as Wyrd allots,<br>
 all mankind's master. My mood is bold<br>
 but forbears to boast o'er this battling-flyer.<br>
 -- Now abide by the barrow, ye breastplate-mailed,<br>
 ye heroes in harness, which of us twain<br>
 better from battle-rush bear his wounds.<br>
 Wait ye the finish. The fight is not yours,<br>
 nor meet for any but me alone<br>
 to measure might with this monster here<br>
 and play the hero. Hardily I<br>
 shall win that wealth, or war shall seize,<br>
 cruel killing, your king and lord!"<br>
 Up stood then with shield the sturdy champion,<br>
 stayed by the strength of his single manhood,<br>
 and hardy 'neath helmet his harness bore<br>
 under cleft of the cliffs: no coward's path!<br>
 Soon spied by the wall that warrior chief,<br>
 survivor of many a victory-field<br>
 where foemen fought with furious clashings,<br>
 an arch of stone; and within, a stream<br>
 that broke from the barrow. The brooklet's wave<br>
 was hot with fire. The hoard that way<br>
 he never could hope unharmed to near,<br>
 or endure those deeps,[4] for the dragon's flame.<br>
 Then let from his breast, for he burst with rage,<br>
 the Weder-Geat prince a word outgo;<br>
 stormed the stark-heart; stern went ringing<br>
 and clear his cry 'neath the cliff-rocks gray.<br>
 The hoard-guard heard a human voice;<br>
 his rage was enkindled. No respite now<br>
 for pact of peace! The poison-breath<br>
 of that foul worm first came forth from the cave,<br>
 hot reek-of-fight: the rocks resounded.<br>
 Stout by the stone-way his shield he raised,<br>
 lord of the Geats, against the loathed-one;<br>
 while with courage keen that coiled foe<br>
 came seeking strife. The sturdy king<br>
 had drawn his sword, not dull of edge,<br>
 heirloom old; and each of the two<br>
 felt fear of his foe, though fierce their mood.<br>
 Stoutly stood with his shield high-raised<br>
 the warrior king, as the worm now coiled<br>
 together amain: the mailed-one waited.<br>
 Now, spire by spire, fast sped and glided<br>
 that blazing serpent. The shield protected,<br>
 soul and body a shorter while<br>
 for the hero-king than his heart desired,<br>
 could his will have wielded the welcome respite<br>
 but once in his life! But Wyrd denied it,<br>
 and victory's honors. -- His arm he lifted<br>
 lord of the Geats, the grim foe smote<br>
 with atheling's heirloom. Its edge was turned<br>
 brown blade, on the bone, and bit more feebly<br>
 than its noble master had need of then<br>
 in his baleful stress. -- Then the barrow's keeper<br>
 waxed full wild for that weighty blow,<br>
 cast deadly flames; wide drove and far<br>
 those vicious fires. No victor's glory<br>
 the Geats' lord boasted; his brand had failed,<br>
 naked in battle, as never it should,<br>
 excellent iron! -- 'Twas no easy path<br>
 that Ecgtheow's honored heir must tread<br>
 over the plain to the place of the foe;<br>
 for against his will he must win a home<br>
 elsewhere far, as must all men, leaving<br>
 this lapsing life! -- Not long it was<br>
 ere those champions grimly closed again.<br>
 The hoard-guard was heartened; high heaved his breast<br>
 once more; and by peril was pressed again,<br>
 enfolded in flames, the folk-commander!<br>
 Nor yet about him his band of comrades,<br>
 sons of athelings, armed stood<br>
 with warlike front: to the woods they bent them,<br>
 their lives to save. But the soul of one<br>
 with care was cumbered. Kinship true<br>
 can never be marred in a noble mind!<br>
 
 [1] Eofor for Wulf. -- The immediate provocation for Eofor in killing "the
 hoary Scylfing," Ongentheow, is that the latter has just struck Wulf down;
 but the king, Haethcyn, is also avenged by the blow. See the detailed 
 description below.<br>
