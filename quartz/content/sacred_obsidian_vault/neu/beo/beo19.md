 A CUP she gave him, with kindly greeting<br>
 and winsome words. Of wounden gold,<br>
 she offered, to honor him, arm-jewels twain,<br>
 corselet and rings, and of collars the noblest<br>
 that ever I knew the earth around.<br>
 Ne'er heard I so mighty, 'neath heaven's dome,<br>
 a hoard-gem of heroes, since Hama bore<br>
 to his bright-built burg the Brisings' necklace,<br>
 jewel and gem casket. -- Jealousy fled he,<br>
 Eormenric's hate: chose help eternal.<br>
 Hygelac Geat, grandson of Swerting,<br>
 on the last of his raids this ring bore with him,<br>
 under his banner the booty defending,<br>
 the war-spoil warding; but Wyrd o'erwhelmed him<br>
 what time, in his daring, dangers he sought,<br>
 feud with Frisians. Fairest of gems<br>
 he bore with him over the beaker-of-waves,<br>
 sovran strong: under shield he died.<br>
 Fell the corpse of the king into keeping of Franks,<br>
 gear of the breast, and that gorgeous ring;<br>
 weaker warriors won the spoil,<br>
 after gripe of battle, from Geatland's lord,<br>
 and held the death-field.<br>
 Din rose in hall.<br>
 Wealhtheow spake amid warriors, and said:--<br>
 "This jewel enjoy in thy jocund youth,<br>
 Beowulf lov'd, these battle-weeds wear,<br>
 a royal treasure, and richly thrive!<br>
 Preserve thy strength, and these striplings here<br>
 counsel in kindness: requital be mine.<br>
 Hast done such deeds, that for days to come<br>
 thou art famed among folk both far and near,<br>
 so wide as washeth the wave of Ocean<br>
 his windy walls. Through the ways of life<br>
 prosper, O prince! I pray for thee<br>
 rich possessions. To son of mine<br>
 be helpful in deed and uphold his joys!<br>
 Here every earl to the other is true,<br>
 mild of mood, to the master loyal!<br>
 Thanes are friendly, the throng obedient,<br>
 liegemen are revelling: list and obey!"<br>
 Went then to her place. -- That was proudest of feasts;<br>
 flowed wine for the warriors. Wyrd they knew not,<br>
 destiny dire, and the doom to be seen<br>
 by many an earl when eve should come,<br>
 and Hrothgar homeward hasten away,<br>
 royal, to rest. The room was guarded<br>
 by an army of earls, as erst was done.<br>
 They bared the bench-boards; abroad they spread<br>
 beds and bolsters. -- One beer-carouser<br>
 in danger of doom lay down in the hall. --<br>
 At their heads they set their shields of war,<br>
 bucklers bright; on the bench were there<br>
 over each atheling, easy to see,<br>
 the high battle-helmet, the haughty spear,<br>
 the corselet of rings. 'Twas their custom so<br>
 ever to be for battle prepared,<br>
 at home, or harrying, which it were,<br>
 even as oft as evil threatened<br>
 their sovran king. -- They were clansmen good.<br>
