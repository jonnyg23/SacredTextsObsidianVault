 <h2 align="center">THE BLUE SPRING.<br> (J<small>ANNSEN.</small>)</h2>
 
 <p>A<small>T</small> the foot of the Villina hill, near the church of Lais,<a name="page_145_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_145_note_1"><font size="1">1</font></a> is a swamp where rises a spring of water, called from its colour the Blue Spring. It is said that the spring can produce rain or drought, and thus cause dearth or plenty. In time of drought three widows of the same name must go to the spring on a Sunday during service-time, to clean it out and to enlarge the opening. Each must take a spade, hoe, rake, a cake of bread, and a hymn-book with her. But if too much rain falls, the spring must be closed up to a mere crevice, and this is at once efficacious.</p>

They then let down a kettle filled with stones, but, to their horror, they drew up a bleeding human head instead. They were about to make another trial, when a voice cried from the depths, “If you attempt this again, you will all sink!” So the depth of the Blue Spring is still unknown.</p>
