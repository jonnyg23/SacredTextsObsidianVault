 <center>CHAPTER XLVII.<br>
 <br>
 <i>Of the further harrying of Thorolf and Egil.</i><br>
 <br>
 </center><font face="Arial">        </font><font face="Georgia">Harold Gormsson had then taken the kingdom in Denmark, his father Gorm being now dead.  The land was then open to harrying; freebooters often lay off the Danish coast.  Aki knew Denmark well both by sea and land.  So Egil inquired of him diligently where the places were that promised good booty.  But when they came to Eyrar-sound, then Aki said that up on land there was a large trading town named Lundr; there, he said, was hope of plunder, but 'twas likely that the townsmen would make resistance.<br>
 The question was put before the men whether they should go up or not.  Opinions were much divided, some liking, some letting it; then the matter was referred to the leaders.  Thorolf was rather for going up.  Then Egil was asked what counsel he thought good.  He recited a stave:<br>
 <br>
                         'Wolf-battening warrior,<br>
                         Wield we high gleaming swords.<br>
                         In snake-fostering summer<br>
                         Such deeds well beseem.<br>
                         Lead up to Lundr:<br>
                         Let laggards be none!<br>
                         Spear-music ungentle<br>
                         By sunset shall sound.'<br>
 <br>
 After that they made them ready to go up, and they came to the town.  But when the townsmen were aware of the enemy's coming, they made against them.  A wooden wall was round the town; they set men to guard this.  A very fierce battle was there fought.  Egil, with his following, charged fiercely on the gate nor spared himself.  There was a great slaughter, the townsmen falling one upon another.  It is said that Egil first entered the town, the others following.  Then those of the town fled, and great was the slaughter.  But Thorolf and his company plundered the town and took much wealth, and fired the buildings before they left.  Then they went down to their ships.<br>
