 <p>"WHAT have I earned for all that work," I said,<br> "For all that I have done at my own charge?<br> The daily spite of this unmannerly town,<br> Where who has served the most is most defamed,<br> The reputation of his lifetime lost<br> Between the night and morning. I might have lived,<br> And you know well how great the longing has been,<br> Where every day my footfall should have lit<br> In the green shadow of Ferrara wall;<br> Or climbed among the images of the past--<br> The unperturbed and courtly images--<br> Evening and morning, the steep street of Urbino<br> To where the duchess and her people talked<br> The stately midnight through until they stood<br> In their great window looking at the dawn;<br> I might have had no friend that could not mix<br> Courtesy and passion into one like those <a name="page_276"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 276</font></a><br> That saw the wicks grow yellow in the dawn;<br> I might have used the one substantial right<br> My trade allows: chosen my company,<br> And chosen what scenery had pleased me best."<br> Thereon my phoenix answered in reproof,<br> "The drunkards, pilferers of public funds,<br> All the dishonest crowd I had driven away,<br> When my luck changed and they dared meet my face,<br> Crawled from obscurity, and set upon me<br> Those I had served and some that I had fed;<br> Yet never have I, now nor any time,<br> Complained of the people."</p>  
 <p>                           All I could reply<br> Was: "You, that have not lived in thought but deed,<br> Can have the purity of a natural force,<br> But I, whose virtues are the definitions<br> Of the analytic mind, can neither close<br> The eye of the mind nor keep my tongue from speech."<br> And yet, because my heart leaped at her words,<br> I was abashed, and now they come to mind<br> After nine years, I sink my head abashed.</p>
