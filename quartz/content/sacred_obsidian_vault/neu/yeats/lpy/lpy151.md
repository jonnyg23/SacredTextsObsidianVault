 <p align="center">I</p>  
 <p>ON the grey rock of Cashel the mind's eye<br> Has called up the cold spirits that are born<br> When the old moon is vanished from the sky<br> And the new still hides her horn.</p>  
 <p>Under blank eyes and fingers never still<br> The particular is pounded till it is man,<br> When had I my own will?<br> Oh, not since life began.</p>  
 <p>Constrained, arraigned, baffled, bent and unbent<br> By these wire jointed jaws and limbs of wood,<br> Themselves obedient,<br> Knowing not evil and good;</p>  
 <p>Obedient to some hidden magical breath.<br> They do not even feel, so abstract are they, <a name="page_317"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 317</font></a><br> So dead beyond our death,<br> Triumph that we obey.</p>  
 <p align="center">II</p>  
 <p>On the grey rock of Cashel I suddenly saw<br> A Sphinx with woman breast and lion paw,<br> A Buddha, hand at rest,<br> Hand lifted up that blest;</p>  
 <p>And right between these two a girl at play<br> That it maybe had danced her life away,<br> For now being dead it seemed<br> That she of dancing dreamed.</p>  
 <p>Although I saw it all in the mind's eye<br> There can be nothing solider till I die;<br> I saw by the moon's light<br> Now at its fifteenth night.</p>  
 <p>One lashed her tail; her eyes lit by the moon<br> Gazed upon all things known, all things unknown,<br> In triumph of intellect<br> With motionless head erect.</p>  
 <p>That other's moonlit eyeballs never moved,<br> Being fixed on all things loved, all things unloved,<br> Yet little peace he had<br> For those that love are sad.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_318"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 318</font></a></p>  
 <p>Oh, little did they care who danced between,<br> And little she by whom her dance was seen<br> So that she danced. No thought,<br> Body perfection brought,</p>  
 <p>For what but eye and ear silence the mind<br> With the minute particulars of mankind?<br> Mind moved yet seemed to stop<br> As ’twere a spinning-top.</p>  
 <p>In contemplation had those three so wrought<br> Upon a moment, and so stretched it out<br> That they, time overthrown,<br> Were dead yet flesh and bone.</p>  
 <p align="center">III</p>  
 <p>I knew that I had seen, had seen at last<br> That girl my unremembering nights hold fast<br> Or else my dreams that fly,<br> If I should rub an eye,</p>  
 <p>And yet in flying fling into my meat<br> A crazy juice that makes the pulses beat<br> As though I had been undone<br> By Homer's Paragon</p>  
 <p>Who never gave the burning town a thought;<br> To such a pitch of folly I am brought, <a name="page_319"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 319</font></a><br> Being caught between the pull<br> Of the dark moon and the full,</p>  
 <p>The commonness of thought and images<br> That have the frenzy of our western seas.<br> Thereon I made my moan,<br> And after kissed a stone,</p>  
 <p>And after that arranged it in a song<br> Seeing that I, ignorant for so long,<br> Had been rewarded thus<br> In Cormac's ruined house.</p>
