 <p>GOD grant a blessing on this tower and cottage<br> And on my heirs, if all remain unspoiled,<br> No table, or chair or stool not simple enough<br> For shepherd lads in Galilee; and grant<br> That I myself for portions of the year<br> May handle nothing and set eyes on nothing<br> But what the great and passionate have used<br> Throughout so many varying centuries.<br> We take it for the norm; yet should I dream<br> Sinbad the sailor's brought a painted chest,<br> Or image, from beyond the Loadstone Mountain,<br> That dream is a norm; and should some limb of the devil<br> Destroy the view by cutting down an ash<br> That shades the road, or setting up a cottage<br> Planned in a government office, shorten his life,<br> Manacle his soul upon the Red Sea bottom.</p>
