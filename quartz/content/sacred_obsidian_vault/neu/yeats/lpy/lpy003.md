 <p>THE host is riding from Knocknarea<br> And over the grave of Clooth-na bare;<br> Caolte tossing his burning hair<br> And Niamh calling <i>Away, come away</i>:<br> <i>Empty your heart of its mortal dream.<br> The winds awaken, the leaves whirl round,<br> Our cheeks are pale, our hair is unbound,<br> Our breasts are heaving, our eyes are agleam,<br> Our arms are waving, our lips are apart;<br> And if any gaze on our rushing band,<br> We come between him and the deed of his hand,<br> We come between him and the hope of his heart</i>.<br> The host is rushing ’twixt night and day,<br> And where is there hope or deed as fair?<br> Caolte tossing his burning hair,<br> And Niamh calling <i>Away, come away</i>.</p>
