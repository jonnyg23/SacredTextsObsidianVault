 <p>O THOUGHT, fly to her when the end of day<br> Awakens an old memory, and say,<br> "Your strength, that is so lofty and fierce and kind,<br> It might call up a new age, calling to mind<br> The queens that were imagined long ago,<br> Is but half yours: he kneaded in the dough<br> Through the long years of youth, and who would have thought<br> It all, and more than it all, would come to naught,<br> And that dear words meant nothing?" But enough,<br> For when we have blamed the wind we can blame love;<br> Or, if there needs be more, be nothing said<br> That would be harsh for children that have strayed.</p>
