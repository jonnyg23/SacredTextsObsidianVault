 <p>"ALTHOUGH I'd lie lapped up in linen<br> A deal I'd sweat and little earn<br> If I should live as live the neighbours,"<br> Cried the beggar, Billy Byrne;<br> "Stretch bones till the daylight come<br> On great-grandfather's battered tomb."</p>  
 <p>Upon a grey old battered tombstone<br> In Glendalough beside the stream,<br> Where the O'Byrnes and Byrnes are buried,<br> He stretched his bones and fell in a dream<br> Of sun and moon that a good hour<br> Bellowed and pranced in the round tower;</p>  
 <p>Of golden king and silver lady,<br> Bellowing up and bellowing round,<br> Till toes mastered a sweet measure,<br> Mouth mastered a sweet sound,<br> Prancing round and prancing up<br> Until they pranced upon the top.</p>  
 <p>That golden king and that wild lady<br> Sang till stars began to fade,<br> Hands gripped in hands, toes close together, <a name="page_249"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 249</font></a><br> Hair spread on the wind they made;<br> That lady and that golden king<br> Could like a brace of blackbirds sing.</p>  
 <p>"It's certain that my luck is broken,"<br> That rambling jailbird Billy said;<br> "Before nightfall I'll pick a pocket<br> And snug it in a feather-bed,<br> I cannot find the peace of home<br> On great-grandfather's battered tomb."</p>
