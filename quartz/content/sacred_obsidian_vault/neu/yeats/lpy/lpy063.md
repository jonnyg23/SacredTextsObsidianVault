 <p>SOME may have blamed you that you took away<br> The verses that could move them on the day<br> When, the ears being deafened, the sight of the eyes blind<br> With lightning you went from me, and I could find<br> Nothing to make a song about but kings,<br> Helmets, and swords, and half-forgotten things<br> That were like memories of you--but now<br> We'll out, for the world lives as long ago;<br> And while we're in our laughing, weeping fit,<br> Hurl helmets, crowns, and swords into the pit.<br> But, dear, cling close to me; since you were gone,<br> My barren thoughts have chilled me to the bone.</p>
