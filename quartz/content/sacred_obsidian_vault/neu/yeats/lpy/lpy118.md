 <p>SANG Solomon to Sheba,<br> And kissed her dusky face,<br> "All day long from mid-day<br> We have talked in the one place,<br> All day long from shadowless noon<br> We have gone round and round<br> In the narrow theme of love<br> Like an old horse in a pound."</p>  
 <p>To Solomon sang Sheba,<br> Planted on his knees,<br> "If you had broached a matter<br> That might the learned please,<br> You had before the sun had thrown<br> Our shadows on the ground<br> Discovered that my thoughts, not it,<br> Are but a narrow pound."</p>  
 <p>Sang Solomon to Sheba,<br> And kissed her Arab eyes,<br> "There's not a man or woman<br> Born under the skies<br> Dare match in learning with us two,<br> And all day long we have found<br> There's not a thing but love can make<br> The world a narrow pound."</p>
