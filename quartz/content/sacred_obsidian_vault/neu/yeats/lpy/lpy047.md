 <p>I CRIED when the moon was murmuring to the birds:<br> "Let peewit call and curlew cry where they will,<br> I long for your merry and tender and pitiful words,<br> For the roads are unending, and there is no place to my mind."<br> The honey-pale moon lay low on the sleepy hill,<br> And I fell asleep upon lonely Echtge of streams.<br> No boughs have withered because of the wintry wind;<br> The boughs have withered because I have told them my dreams.</p>  
 <p>I know of the leafy paths that the witches take,<br> Who come with their crowns of pearl and their spindles of wool,<br> And their secret smile, out of the depths of the lake; <a name="page_77"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 77</font></a><br> I know where a dim moon drifts, where the Danaan kind<br> Wind and unwind their dances when the light grows cool<br> On the island lawns, their feet where the pale foam gleams.<br> No boughs have withered because of the wintry wind;<br> The boughs have withered because I have told them my dreams.</p>  
 <p>I know of the sleepy country, where swans fly round<br> Coupled with golden chains, and sing as they fly.<br> A king and a queen are wandering there, and the sound<br> Has made them so happy and hopeless, so deaf and so blind<br> With wisdom, they wander till all the years have gone by;<br> I know, and the curlew and peewit on Echtge of streams.<br> No boughs have withered because of the wintry wind;<br> The boughs have withered because I have told them my dreams.</p>
