 <p>Was it the double of my dream<br> The woman that by me lay<br> Dreamed, or did we halve a dream<br> Under the first cold gleam of day?</p>  
 <p>I thought: "There is a waterfall<br> Upon Ben Bulben side,<br> That all my childhood counted dear;<br> Were I to travel far and wide<br> I could not find a thing so dear."<br> My memories had magnified<br> So many times childish delight.</p>  
 <p>I would have touched it like a child<br> But knew my finger could but have touched<br> Cold stone and water. I grew wild<br> Even accusing heaven because<br> It had set down among its laws:<br> Nothing that we love over-much<br> Is ponderable to our touch.</p>  
 <p>I dreamed towards break of day,<br> The cold blown spray in my nostril. <a name="page_343"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 343</font></a><br> But she that beside me lay<br> Had watched in bitterer sleep<br> The marvellous stag of Arthur,<br> That lofty white stag, leap<br> From mountain steep to steep.</p>
