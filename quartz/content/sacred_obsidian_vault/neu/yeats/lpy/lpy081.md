 <p><i>POETS with whom I learned my trade,<br> Companions of the Cheshire Cheese,<br> Here's an old story I've re-made,<br> Imagining ’twould better please<br> Your ears than stories now in fashion,<br> Though you may think I waste my breath<br> Pretending that there can be passion<br> That has more life in it than death,<br> find though at bottling of your wine<br> Old wholesome Goban had no say;<br> The moral's yours because it's mine</i>.</p>  
 <p>When cups went round at close of day--<br> Is not that how good stories run?--<br> The gods were sitting at the board<br> In their great house at Slievenamon,<br> And sang a drowsy song, or snored,<br> For all were full of wine and meat;<br> And smoky torches made a glare<br> On metal Goban 'd hammered at,<br> On old deep silver rolling there<br> Or on some still unemptied cup<br> That he, when frenzy stirred his thewes,<br> Had hammered out on mountain top <a name="page_178"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 178</font></a><br> To hold the sacred stuff he brews<br> That only gods may buy of him.</p>  
 <p>Now from that juice that made them wise<br> All those had lifted up the dim<br> Imaginations of their eyes,<br> For one that was like woman made<br> Before their sleepy eyelids ran<br> And trembling with her passion said,<br> "Come out and dig for a dead man,<br> Who's burrowing somewhere in the ground,<br> And mock him to his face and then<br> Hollo him on with horse and hound,<br> For he is the worst of all dead men."</p>  
 <p><i>We should be dazed and terror struck,<br> If we but saw in dreams that room,<br> Those wine-drenched eyes, and curse our luck<br> That emptied all our days to come.<br> I knew a woman none could please,<br> Because she dreamed when but a child<br> Of men and women made like these;<br> And after, when her blood ran wild,<br> Had ravelled her own story out,<br> And said, "In two or in three years<br> I need must marry some poor lout,"<br> And having said it burst in tears</i>.</p>  
 <p><i>Since, tavern comrades, you have died,<br> Maybe your images have stood,<br> Mere bone and muscle thrown aside</i>, <a name="page_179"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 179</font></a><br> <i>Before that roomful or as good.<br> You had to face your ends when young--<br> ’Twas wine or women, or some curse--<br> But never made a poorer song<br> That you might have a heavier purse,<br> Nor gave loud service to a cause<br> That you might have a troop of friends.<br> You kept the Muses' sterner laws,<br> And unrepenting faced your ends,<br> And therefore earned the right--and yet<br> Dowson and Johnson most I praise--<br> To troop with those the world's forgot,<br> And copy their proud steady gaze</i>.</p>  
 <p>"The Danish troop was driven out<br> Between the dawn and dusk," she said;<br> "Although the event was long in doubt,<br> Although the King of Ireland's dead<br> And half the kings, before sundown<br> All was accomplished."</p>  
 <p>                             "When this day<br> Murrough, the King of Ireland's son,<br> Foot after foot was giving way,<br> He and his best troops back to back<br> Had perished there, but the Danes ran,<br> Stricken with panic from the attack,<br> The shouting of an unseen man;<br> And being thankful Murrough found,<br> Led by a footsole dipped in blood<br> That had made prints upon the ground, <a name="page_180"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 180</font></a><br> Where by old thorn trees that man stood;<br> And though when he gazed here and there,<br> He had but gazed on thorn trees, spoke,<br> 'Who is the friend that seems but air<br> And yet could give so fine a stroke? '<br> Thereon a young man met his eye,<br> Who said, 'Because she held me in<br> Her love, and would not have me die,<br> Rock-nurtured Aoife took a pin,<br> And pushing it into my shirt,<br> Promised that for a pin's sake,<br> No man should see to do me hurt;<br> But there it's gone; I will not take<br> The fortune that had been my shame<br> Seeing, King's son, what wounds you have.'<br> ’Twas roundly spoke, but when night came<br> He had betrayed me to his grave,<br> For he and the King's son were dead.<br> I'd promised him two hundred years,<br> And when for all I'd done or said--<br> And these immortal eyes shed tears--<br> He claimed his country's need was most,<br> I'd saved his life, yet for the sake<br> Of a new friend he has turned a ghost.<br> What does he care if my heart break?<br> I call for spade and horse and hound<br> That we may harry him." Thereon<br> She cast herself upon the ground<br> And rent her clothes and made her moan:<br> "Why are they faithless when their might<br> Is from the holy shades that rove <a name="page_181"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 181</font></a><br> The grey rock and the windy light?<br> Why should the faithfullest heart most love<br> The bitter sweetness of false faces?<br> Why must the lasting love what passes,<br> Why are the gods by men betrayed!"</p>  
 <p>But thereon every god stood up<br> With a slow smile and without sound,<br> And stretching forth his arm and cup<br> To where she moaned upon the ground,<br> Suddenly drenched her to the skin;<br> And she with Goban's wine adrip,<br> No more remembering what had been,<br> Stared at the gods with laughing lip.</p>  
 <p><i>I have kept my faith, though faith was tried,<br> To that rock-born, rock-wandering foot,<br> And the world's altered since you died,<br> And I am in no good repute<br> With the loud host before the sea,<br> That think sword strokes were better meant<br> Than lover's music--let that be,<br> So that the wandering foot's content</i>.</p>
