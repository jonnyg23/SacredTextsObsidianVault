 <p>ALL things uncomely and broken, all things worn out and old,<br> The cry of a child by the roadway, the creak of a lumbering cart,<br> The heavy steps of the ploughman, splashing the wintry mould,<br> Are wronging your image that blossoms a rose in the deeps of my heart.</p>  
 <p>The wrong of unshapely things is a wrong too great to be told;<br> I hunger to build them anew and sit on a green knoll apart,<br> With the earth and the sky and the water, remade, like a casket of gold<br> For my dreams of your image that blossoms a rose in the deeps of my heart.</p>
