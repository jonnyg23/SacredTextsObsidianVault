 <p>THE trees are in their autumn beauty,<br> The woodland paths are dry,<br> Under the October twilight the water<br> Mirrors a still sky;<br> Upon the brimming water among the stones<br> Are nine and fifty swans.</p>  
 <p>The nineteenth Autumn has come upon me<br> Since I first made my count;<br> I saw, before I had well finished,<br> All suddenly mount<br> And scatter wheeling in great broken rings<br> Upon their clamorous wings.</p>  
 <p>I have looked upon those brilliant creatures,<br> And now my heart is sore.<br> All's changed since I, hearing at twilight,<br> The first time on this shore,<br> The bell-beat of their wings above my head,<br> Trod with a lighter tread.</p>  
 <p>Unwearied still, lover by lover,<br> They paddle in the cold,<br> Companionable streams or climb the air; <a name="page_238"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 238</font></a><br> Their hearts have not grown old;<br> Passion or conquest, wander where they will,<br> Attend upon them still.</p>  
 <p>But now they drift on the still water<br> Mysterious, beautiful;<br> Among what rushes will they build,<br> By what lake's edge or pool<br> Delight men's eyes when I awake some day<br> To find they have flown away?</p>
