 <p>I HAVE drunk ale from the Country of the Young<br> And weep because I know all things now:<br> I have been a hazel tree and they hung<br> The Pilot Star and the Crooked Plough<br> Among my leaves in times out of mind:<br> I became a rush that horses tread:<br> I became a man, a hater of the wind,<br> Knowing one, out of all things, alone, that his head<br> Would not lie on the breast or his lips on the hair<br> Of the woman that he loves, until he dies.<br> O beast of the wilderness, bird of the air,<br> Must I endure your amorous cries?</p>
