 <p>THESE are the clouds about the fallen sun,<br> The majesty that shuts his burning eye:<br> The weak lay hand on what the strong has done,<br> Till that be tumbled that was lifted high<br> And discord follow upon unison,<br> And all things at one common level lie.<br> And therefore, friend, if your great race were run<br> And these things came, so much the more thereby<br> Have you made greatness your companion,<br> Although it be for children that you sigh:<br> These are the clouds about the fallen sun,<br> The majesty that shuts his burning eye.</p>
