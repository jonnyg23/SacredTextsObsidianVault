 <p>O WHAT to me the little room<br> That was brimmed up with prayer and rest;<br> He bade me out into the gloom,<br> And my breast lies upon his breast.</p>  
 <p>O what to me my mother's care,<br> The house where I was safe and warm;<br> The shadowy blossom of my hair<br> Will hide us from the bitter storm.</p>  
 <p>O hiding hair and dewy eyes,<br> I am no more with life and death,<br> My heart upon his warm heart lies,<br> My breath is mixed into his breath.</p>
