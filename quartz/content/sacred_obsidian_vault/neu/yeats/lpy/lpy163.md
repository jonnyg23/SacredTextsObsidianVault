 <p>TURNING and turning in the widening gyre<br> The falcon cannot hear the falconer;<br> Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;<br> Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,<br> The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere<br> The ceremony of innocence is drowned;<br> The best lack all conviction, while the worst<br> Are full of passionate intensity.</p>  
 <p>Surely some revelation is at hand;<br> Surely the Second Coming is at hand.<br> The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out<br> When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi<br> Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert<br> A shape with lion body and the head of a man,<br> A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,<br> Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it<br> Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds. <a name="page_347"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 347</font></a><br> The darkness drops again; but now I know<br> That twenty centuries of stony sleep<br> Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,<br> And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,<br> Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?</p>
