 <p>I'LL say and maybe dream I have drawn content--<br> Seeing that time has frozen up the blood,<br> The wick of youth being burned and the oil spent--<br> From beauty that is cast out of a mould<br> In bronze, or that in dazzling marble appears,<br> Appears, and when we have gone is gone again,<br> Being more indifferent to our solitude<br> Than ’twere an apparition. O heart, we are old,<br> The living beauty is for younger men,<br> We cannot pay its tribute of wild tears.</p>
