 <p>AH, that Time could touch a form<br> That could show what Homer's age<br> Bred to be a hero's wage.<br> "Were not all her life but storm,<br> Would not painters paint a form<br> Of such noble lines," I said,<br> "Such a delicate high head,<br> All that sternness amid charm,<br> All that sweetness amid strength?"<br> Ah, but peace that comes at length,<br> Came when Time had touched her form.</p>
