 <p><a name="page_212"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 212</font></a></p>  <h3 align="center">THE HOUR BEFORE DAWN</h3>  
 <p>A CURSING rogue with a merry face,<br> A bundle of rags upon a crutch,<br> Stumbled upon that windy place<br> Called Croghan, and it was as much<br> As the one sturdy leg could do<br> To keep him upright while he cursed.<br> He had counted, where long years ago<br> Queen Maeve's nine Maines had been nursed,<br> A pair of lapwings, one old sheep<br> And not a house to the plain's edge,<br> When close to his right hand a heap<br> Of grey stones and a rocky ledge<br> Reminded him that he could make,<br> If he but shifted a few stones,<br> A shelter till the daylight broke.</p>  
 <p>But while he fumbled with the stones<br> They toppled over; "Were it not<br> I have a lucky wooden shin<br> I had been hurt"; and toppling brought<br> Before his eyes, where stones had been,<br> A dark deep hollow in the rock.<br> He gave a gasp and thought to have fled, <a name="page_213"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 213</font></a><br> Being certain it was no right rock<br> Because an ancient history said<br> Hell Mouth lay open near that place,<br> And yet stood still, because inside<br> A great lad with a beery face<br> Had tucked himself away beside<br> A ladle and a tub of beer,<br> And snored, no phantom by his look.<br> So with a laugh at his own fear<br> He crawled into that pleasant nook.</p>  
 <p>"Night grows uneasy near the dawn<br> Till even I sleep light; but who<br> Has tired of his own company?<br> What one of Maeve's nine brawling sons<br> Sick of his grave has wakened me?<br> But let him keep his grave for once<br> That I may find the sleep I have lost."</p>  
 <p>"What care I if you sleep or wake<br> But I'll have no man call me ghost."</p>  
 <p>"Say what you please, but from daybreak<br> I'll sleep another century."</p>  
 <p>"And I will talk before I sleep<br> And drink before I talk."<br>                                 And he<br> Had dipped the wooden ladle deep<br> Into the sleeper's tub of beer<br> Had not the sleeper started up. <a name="page_214"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 214</font></a></p>  
 <p>"Before you have dipped it in the beer<br> I dragged from Goban's mountain-top<br> I'll have assurance that you are able<br> To value beer; no half-legged fool<br> Shall dip his nose into my ladle<br> Merely for stumbling on this hole<br> In the bad hour before the dawn."</p>  
 <p>"Why, beer is only beer."<br>                              "But say<br> I'll sleep until the winter's gone,<br> Or maybe to Midsummer Day,'<br> And drink, and you will sleep that length."</p>  
 <p>"I'd like to sleep till winter's gone<br> Or till the sun is in his strength.<br> This blast has chilled me to the bone."</p>  
 <p>"I had no better plan at first.<br> I thought to wait for that or this;<br> Maybe the weather was a-cursed<br> Or I had no woman there to kiss;<br> So slept for half a year or so;<br> But year by year I found that less<br> Gave me such pleasure I'd forgo<br> Even a half hour's nothingness,<br> And when at one year's end I found<br> I had not waked a single minute,<br> I chose this burrow under ground.<br> I'll sleep away all Time within it:<br> My sleep were now nine centuries <a name="page_215"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 215</font></a><br> But for those mornings when I find<br> The lapwing at their foolish cries<br> And the sheep bleating at the wind<br> As when I also played the fool."</p>  
 <p>The beggar in a rage began<br> Upon his hunkers in the hole,<br> "It's plain that you are no right man<br> To mock at everything I love<br> As if it were not worth the doing.<br> I'd have a merry life enough<br> If a good Easter wind were blowing,<br> And though the winter wind is bad<br> I should not be too down in the mouth<br> For anything you did or said<br> If but this wind were in the south."</p>  
 <p>"You cry aloud, O would ’twere spring<br> Or that the wind would shift a point,<br> And do not know that you would bring,<br> If time were suppler in the joint,<br> Neither the spring nor the south wind<br> But the hour when you shall pass away<br> And leave no smoking wick behind,<br> For all life longs for the Last Day<br> And there's no man but cocks his ear<br> To know when Michael's trumpet cries<br> That flesh and bone may disappear,<br> And souls as if they were but sighs,<br> And there be nothing but God left;<br> But I alone being blessed keep <a name="page_216"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 216</font></a><br> Like some old rabbit to my cleft<br> And wait Him in a drunken sleep."<br> He dipped his ladle in the tub<br> And drank and yawned and stretched him out.<br> The other shouted, "You would rob<br> My life of every pleasant thought<br> And every comfortable thing<br> And so take that and that." Thereon<br> He gave him a great pummelling,<br> But might have pummelled at a stone<br> For all the sleeper knew or cared;<br> And after heaped up stone on stone,<br> And then, grown weary, prayed and cursed<br> And heaped upon stone on stone again,<br> And prayed and cursed and cursed and fled<br> From Maeve and all that juggling plain,<br> Nor gave God thanks till overhead<br> The clouds were brightening with the dawn.</p>
