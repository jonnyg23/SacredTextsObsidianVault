 <p>THIS great purple butterfly,<br> In the prison of my hands,<br> Has a learning in his eye<br> Not a poor fool understands.</p>  
 <p>Once he lived a schoolmaster<br> With a stark, denying look,<br> A string of scholars went in fear<br> Of his great birch and his great book.</p>  
 <p>Like the clangour of a bell,<br> Sweet and harsh, harsh and sweet,<br> That is how he learnt so well<br> To take the roses for his meat.</p>
