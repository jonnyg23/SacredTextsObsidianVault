 <p><i>AN old man cocked his ear upon a bridge;<br> He and his friend, their faces to the South,<br> Had trod the uneven road. Their boots were soiled,<br> Their Connemara cloth worn out of shape;<br> They had kept a steady pace as though their beds,<br> Despite a dwindling and late risen moon,<br> Were distant. An old man cocked his ear</i>.</p>  
 <p align="center">AHERNE</p>  
 <p>What made that sound?</p>  
 <p align="center">ROBARTES</p>  
 <p>                           A rat or water-hen<br> Splashed, or an otter slid into the stream.<br> We are on the bridge; that shadow is the tower,<br> And the light proves that he is reading still.<br> He has found, after the manner of his kind,<br> Mere images; chosen this place to live in<br> Because, it may be, of the candle light <a name="page_302"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 302</font></a><br> From the far tower where Milton's platonist<br> Sat late, or Shelley's visionary prince:<br> The lonely light that Samuel Palmer engraved,<br> An image of mysterious wisdom won by toil;<br> And now he seeks in book or manuscript<br> What he shall never find.</p>  
 <p align="center">AHERNE</p>  
 <p>                          Why should not you<br> Who know it all ring at his door, and speak<br> Just truth enough to show that his whole life<br> Will scarcely find for him a broken crust<br> Of all those truths that are your daily bread;<br> And when you have spoken take the roads again?</p>  
 <p align="center">ROBARTES</p>  
 <p>He wrote of me in that extravagant style<br> He had learnt from Pater, and to round his tale<br> Said I was dead; and dead I choose to be.</p>  
 <p align="center">AHERNE</p>  
 <p>Sing me the changes of the moon once more;<br> True song, though speech: "mine author sung it me."</p>  
 <p><a name="page_303"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 303</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">ROBARTES</p>  
 <p>Twenty-and-eight the phases of the moon,<br> The full and the moon's dark and all the crescents,<br> Twenty-and-eight, and yet but six-and-twenty<br> The cradles that a man must needs be rocked in:<br> For there's no human life at the full or the dark.<br> From the first crescent to the half, the dream<br> But summons to adventure and the man<br> Is always happy like a bird or a beast;<br> But while the moon is rounding towards the full<br> He follows whatever whim's most difficult<br> Among whims not impossible, and though scarred,<br> As with the cat-o’-nine-tails of the mind,<br> His body moulded from within his body<br> Grows comelier. Eleven pass, and then<br> Athenae takes Achilles by the hair,<br> Hector is in the dust, Nietzsche is born,<br> Because the heroes' crescent is the twelfth.<br> And yet, twice born, twice buried, grow he must,<br> Before the full moon, helpless as a worm.<br> The thirteenth moon but sets the soul at war <a name="page_304"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 304</font></a><br> In its own being, and when that war's begun<br> There is no muscle in the arm; and after<br> Under the frenzy of the fourteenth moon<br> The soul begins to tremble into stillness,<br> To die into the labyrinth of itself!</p>  
 <p align="center">AHERNE</p>  
 <p>Sing out the song; sing to the end, and sing<br> The strange reward of all that discipline.</p>  
 <p align="center">ROBARTES</p>  
 <p>All thought becomes an image and the soul<br> Becomes a body: that body and that soul<br> Too perfect at the full to lie in a cradle,<br> Too lonely for the traffic of the world:<br> Body and soul cast out and cast away<br> Beyond the visible world.</p>  
 <p align="center">AHERNE</p>  
 <p>                       All dreams of the soul<br> End in a beautiful man's or woman's body.</p>  
 <p align="center">ROBARTES</p>  
 <p>Have you not always known it?</p>  
 <p><a name="page_305"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 305</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">AHERNE</p>  
 <p>The song will have it<br> That those that we have loved got their long fingers<br> From death, and wounds, or on Sinai's top,<br> Or from some bloody whip in their own hands.<br> They ran from cradle to cradle till at last<br> Their beauty dropped out of the loneliness<br> Of body and soul.</p>  
 <p align="center">ROBARTES</p>  
 <p align="right">The lovers' heart knows that.</p>  
 <p align="center">AHERNE</p>  
 <p>It must be that the terror in their eyes<br> Is memory or foreknowledge of the hour<br> When all is fed with light and heaven is bare.</p>  
 <p align="center">ROBARTES</p>  
 <p>When the moon's full those creatures of the full<br> Are met on the waste hills by country men<br> Who shudder and hurry by: body and soul<br> Estranged amid the strangeness of themselves <a name="page_306"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 306</font></a><br> Caught up in contemplation, the mind's eye<br> Fixed upon images that once were thought,<br> For separate, perfect, and immovable<br> Images can break the solitude<br> Of lovely, satisfied, indifferent eyes.</p>  
 <p><i>And thereupon with aged, high-pitched voice<br> Aherne laughed, thinking of the man within,<br> His sleepless candle and laborious pen</i>.</p>  
 <p align="center">ROBARTES</p>  
 <p>And after that the crumbling of the moon.<br> The soul remembering its loneliness<br> Shudders in many cradles; all is changed,<br> It would be the world's servant, and as it serves,<br> Choosing whatever task's most difficult<br> Among tasks not impossible, it takes<br> Upon the body and upon the soul<br> The coarseness of the drudge.</p>  
 <p align="center">AHERNE</p>  
 <p>                             Before the full<br> It sought itself and afterwards the world.</p>  
 <p align="center">ROBARTES</p>  
 <p>Because you are forgotten, half out of life,<br> And never wrote a book your thought is clear. <a name="page_307"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 307</font></a><br> Reformer, merchant, statesman, learned man,<br> Dutiful husband, honest wife by turn,<br> Cradle upon cradle, and all in flight and all<br> Deformed because there is no deformity<br> But saves us from a dream.</p>  
 <p align="center">AHERNE</p>  
 <p>                          And what of those<br> That the last servile crescent has set free?</p>  
 <p align="center">ROBARTES</p>  
 <p>Because all dark, like those that are all light,<br> They are cast beyond the verge, and in a cloud,<br> Crying to one another like the bats;<br> And having no desire they cannot tell<br> What's good or bad, or what it is to triumph<br> At the perfection of one's own obedience;<br> And yet they speak what's blown into the mind;<br> Deformed beyond deformity, unformed,<br> Insipid as the dough before it is baked,<br> They change their bodies at a word.</p>  
 <p align="center">AHERNE</p>  
 <p align="right">And then?</p>  
 <p><a name="page_308"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 308</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">ROBARTES</p>  
 <p>When all the dough has been so kneaded up<br> That it can take what form cook Nature fancy<br> The first thin crescent is wheeled round once more.</p>  
 <p align="center">AHERNE</p>  
 <p>But the escape; the song's not finished yet.</p>  
 <p align="center">ROBARTES</p>  
 <p>Hunchback and saint and fool are the last crescents.<br> The burning bow that once could shoot an arrow<br> Out of the up and down, the wagon wheel<br> Of beauty's cruelty and wisdom's chatter--<br> Out of that raving tide--is drawn betwixt<br> Deformity of body and of mind.</p>  
 <p align="center">AHERNE</p>  
 <p>Were not our beds far off I'd ring the bell,<br> Stand under the rough roof-timbers of the hall<br> Beside the castle door, where all is stark<br> Austerity, a place set out for wisdom<br> That he will never find; I'd play a part; <a name="page_309"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 309</font></a><br> He would never know me after all these years<br> But take me for some drunken country man;<br> I'd stand and mutter there until he caught<br> "Hunchback and saint and fool," and that they came<br> Under the three last crescents of the moon,<br> And then I'd stagger out. He'd crack his wits<br> Day after day, yet never find the meaning.</p>  
 <p><i>And then he laughed to think that what seemed hard<br> Should be so simple--a bat rose from the hazels<br> And circled round him with its squeaky cry,<br> The light in the tower window was put out</i>.</p>
