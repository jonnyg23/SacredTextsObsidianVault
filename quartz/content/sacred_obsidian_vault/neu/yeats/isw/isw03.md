 <h3 align="CENTER">BAILE AND AILLINN.</h3>
 <p>Argument. Baile and Aillinn were lovers, but Aengus, the Master of Love, wishing them to be happy in his own land among the dead, told to each a story of the other's death, so that their hearts were broken and they died.</p>
 <p><a name="page_10"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 10</font></a></p>
 <p><font color="RED">I hardly hear the curlew cry,<br>
 Nor the grey rush when wind is high,<br>
 Before my thoughts begin to run<br>
 On the heir of Ulad, Buan's son,<br>
 Baile who had the honey mouth,<br>
 And that mild woman of the south,<br>
 Aillinn, who was King Lugaid's heir.<br>
 Their love was never drowned in care<br>
 Of this or that thing, nor grew cold<br>
 Because their bodies had grown old;<br>
 Being forbid to marry on earth<br>
 They blossomed to immortal mirth.</font></p>
 <p>About the time when Christ was born,<br>
 When the long wars for the White Horn<br>
 And the Brown Bull had not yet come,<br>
 Young Baile Honey-Mouth, whom some<br>
 Called rather Baile Little-Land,<br>
 Rode out of Emain with a band<br>
 Of harpers and young men, and they<br>
 Imagined, as they struck the way<br>
 To many pastured Muirthemne, <a name="page_11"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 11</font></a> <br>
 That all things fell out happily<br>
 And. there, for all that fools had said,<br>
 Baile and Aillinn would be wed.</p>
 <p>They found an old man running there,<br>
 He had ragged long grass-yellow hair;<br>
 He had knees that stuck out of his hose;<br>
 He had puddle water in his shoes;<br>
 He had half a cloak to keep him dry;<br>
 Although he had a squirrel's eye.</p>
 <p><font color="RED">O wandering birds and rushy beds<br>
 You put such folly in our heads<br>
 With. all this crying in the wind<br>
 No common love is to our mind,<br>
 And our poor Kate or Nan is less<br>
 Than. any whose unhappiness<br>
 Awoke the harp strings long ago.<br>
 Yet they that know all things but know<br>
 That all life had to give us is<br>
 A child's laughter, a woman's kiss. </font><a name="page_12"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 12</font></a><font color="RED"><br>
 Who was it put so great a scorn<br>
 In the grey reeds that night and morn<br>
 Are trodden and broken by the herds,<br>
 And in the light bodies of birds<br>
 That north wind tumbles to and fro<br>
 And pinches among hall and snow?</font></p>
 <p>That runner said, 'I am from the south;<br>
 I run to Baile Honey-Mouth<br>
 To tell him how the girl Aillinn<br>
 Rode from the country of her kin<br>
 And old and young men rode with her:<br>
 For all that country had been astir<br>
 If anybody half as fair<br>
 Had chosen a husband anywhere<br>
 But where it could see her every day.<br>
 When they had ridden a little way<br>
 An old man caught the horse's head<br>
 With "You must home again and wed<br>
 With somebody in your own land."<br>
 A young man cried and kissed her hand<br>
 "O lady, wed with one of us;" <a name="page_13"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 13</font></a><br>
 And when no face grew piteous<br>
 For any gentle thing she spake<br>
 She fell and died of the heart-break.'</p>
 <p>Because a lover's heart's worn out<br>
 Being tumbled and blown about<br>
 By its own blind imagining,<br>
 And will believe that anything<br>
 That is bad enough to be true, is true,<br>
 Baile's heart was broken in two;<br>
 And he being laid upon green boughs<br>
 Was carried to the goodly house<br>
 Where the Hound of Ulad sat before<br>
 The brazen pillars of his door;<br>
 His face bowed low to weep the end<br>
 Of the harper's daughter and her friend;<br>
 For although years had passed away<br>
 He always wept them on that day,<br>
 For on that day they had been betrayed;<br>
 And now that Honey-Mouth is laid<br>
 Under a cairn of sleepy stone<br>
 Before his eyes, he has tears for none, <a name="page_14"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 14</font></a><br>
 Although he is carrying stone, but two<br>
 For whom the cairn's but heaped anew.</p>
 <p><font color="RED">We hold because our memory is<br>
 So full of that thing and of this<br>
 That out of sight is out of mind.<br>
 But the grey rush under the wind<br>
 And the grey bird with crooked bill<br>
 Have such long memories that they still<br>
 Remember Deirdre and her man,<br>
 And when we walk with Kate or Nan<br>
 About the windy water side<br>
 Our heart can hear the voices chide.<br>
 How could we be so soon content<br>
 Who know the way that Naoise went?<br>
 And they have news of Deirdre's eyes<br>
 Who being lovely was so wise,<br>
 Ah wise, my heart knows well how wise.</font></p>
 <p>Now had that old gaunt crafty one,<br>
 Gathering his cloak about him, run<br>
 Where Aillinn rode with waiting maids<br>
 Who amid leafy lights and shades <a name="page_15"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 15</font></a><br>
 Dreamed of the hands that would unlace<br>
 Their bodices in some dim place<br>
 When they had come to the marriage bed;<br>
 And harpers pondering with bowed head<br>
 A music that had thought enough<br>
 Of the ebb of all things to make love<br>
 Grow gentle without sorrowings;<br>
 And leather-coated men with slings<br>
 Who peered about on every side;<br>
 And amid leafy light he cried,<br>
 I He is well out of wind and wave,<br>
 They have heaped the stones above his grave<br>
 In Muirthemne and over it<br>
 In changeless Ogham letters writ<br>
 <font color="RED">Baile that was of Rury's seed.</font><br>
 But the gods long ago decreed<br>
 No waiting maid should ever spread<br>
 Baile and Aillinn's marriage bed,<br>
 For they should clip and clip again<br>
 Where wild bees hive on the Great Plain.<br>
 Therefore it is but little news<br>
 That put this hurry in my shoes.' <a name="page_16"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 16</font></a><br>
 And hurrying to the south he came<br>
 To that high hill the herdsmen name<br>
 The Hill Seat of Leighin, because<br>
 Some god or king had made the laws<br>
 That held the land together there,<br>
 In old times among the clouds of the air.</p>
 <p>That old man climbed; the day grew dim;<br>
 Two swans came flying up to him<br>
 Linked by a gold chain each to each<br>
 And with low murmuring laughing speech<br>
 Alighted on the windy grass.<br>
 They knew him: his changed body was<br>
 Tall, proud and ruddy, and light wings<br>
 Were hovering over the harp strings<br>
 That Etain, Midhir's wife, had wove<br>
 In the hid place, being crazed by love.</p>
 <p>What shall I call them? fish that swim<br>
 Scale rubbing scale where light is dim<br>
 By a broad water-lily leaf;<br>
 Or mice in the one wheaten sheaf<br>
 Forgotten at the threshing place; <a name="page_17"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 17</font></a><br>
 Or birds lost in the one clear space<br>
 Of morning light in a dim sky;<br>
 Or it may be, the eyelids of one eye<br>
 Or the door pillars of one house,<br>
 Or two sweet blossoming apple boughs<br>
 That have one shadow on the ground;<br>
 Or the two strings that made one sound<br>
 Where that wise harper's finger ran;<br>
 For this young girl and this young man<br>
 Have happiness without an end<br>
 Because they have made so good a friend.</p>
 <p>They know all wonders, for they pass<br>
 The towery gates of Gorias<br>
 And Findrias and Falias<br>
 And long-forgotten Murias,<br>
 Among the giant kings whose hoard<br>
 Cauldron and spear and stone and sword<br>
 Was robbed before Earth gave the wheat;<br>
 Wandering from broken street to street<br>
 They come where some huge watcher is<br>
 And tremble with their love and kiss. <a name="page_18"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 18</font></a><br>
 They know undying things, for they<br>
 Wander where earth withers away,<br>
 Though nothing troubles the great streams<br>
 But light from the pale stars, and gleams<br>
 From the holy orchards, where there is none<br>
 But fruit that is of precious stone,<br>
 Or apples of the sun and moon.</p>
 <p>What were our praise to them: they eat<br>
 Quiet's wild heart, like daily meat,<br>
 Who when night thickens are afloat<br>
 On dappled skins in a glass boat<br>
 Far out under a windless sky,<br>
 While over them birds of Aengus fly,<br>
 And over the tiller and the prow<br>
 And waving white wings to and fro<br>
 Awaken wanderings of light air<br>
 To stir their coverlet and their hair.</p>
 <p>And poets found, old writers say,<br>
 A yew tree where his body lay,<br>
 But a wild apple hid the grass <a name="page_19"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 19</font></a><br>
 With its sweet blossom where hers was<br>
 And being in good heart, because<br>
 A better time had come again<br>
 After the deaths of many men,<br>
 And that long fighting at the ford,<br>
 They wrote on tablets of thin board,<br>
 Made of the apple and the yew,<br>
 All the love stories that they knew.</p>
 <p><font color="RED">Let rush and bird cry out their fill<br>
 Of the harper's daughter if they will,<br>
 Beloved, I am not afraid of her<br>
 She is not wiser noir lovelier,<br>
 And you are more high of heart than she<br>
 For all her wanderings over-sea;<br>
 But I'd have bird and rush forget<br>
 Those other two, for never yet<br>
 Has lover lived but longed to wive<br>
 Like them that are no more alive.</font></p>
