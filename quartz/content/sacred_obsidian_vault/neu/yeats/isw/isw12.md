 <h3 align="CENTER">THE RIDER FROM THE NORTH.</h3>
 <p align="CENTER">From the play of The Country of the Young.</p>
 <p>There's many a strong farmer<br>
 Whose heart would break in two<br>
 If he could see the townland<br>
 That we are riding to;<br>
 Boughs have their fruit and blossom,<br>
 At all times of the year,<br>
 Rivers are running over<br>
 With red beer and brown beer.<br>
 An old man plays the bagpipes<br>
 In a golden and silver wood,<br>
 Queens, their eyes blue like the ice,<br>
 Are dancing in a crowd. <a name="page_31"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 31</font></a><br>
 The little fox he murmured,<br>
 'O what is the world's bane?'<br>
 The sun was laughing sweetly,<br>
 The moon plucked at my rein;<br>
 But the little red fox murmured,<br>
 'O do not pluck at his rein,<br>
 He is riding to the townland<br>
 That is the world's bane.'</p>
 <p>When their hearts are so high,<br>
 That they would come to blows,<br>
 They unhook their heavy swords<br>
 From golden and silver boughs;<br>
 But all that are killed in battle<br>
 Awaken to life again;<br>
 It is lucky that their story<br>
 Is not known among men.<br>
 For O the strong farmers<br>
 That would let the spade lie,<br>
 For their hearts would be like a cup<br>
 That somebody had drunk dry. <a name="page_32"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 32</font></a><br>
 The little fox he: murmured,<br>
 'O what is the world's bane?'<br>
 The sun was laughing sweetly,<br>
 The moon plucked at my rein;<br>
 But the little red fox murmured,<br>
 'O do not pluck at his rein,<br>
 He is riding to the townland<br>
 That is the world's bane.'</p>
 <p>Michael will unhook his trumpet<br>
 From a bough overhead,<br>
 And blow a little noise<br>
 When the supper has been spread.<br>
 Gabriel will come from the water<br>
 With a fish tail, and talk<br>
 Of wonders that have happened<br>
 On wet roads where men walk,<br>
 And lift up an old horn<br>
 Of hammered silver, and drink<br>
 Till he has fallen asleep<br>
 Upon the starry brink. <a name="page_33"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 33</font></a><br>
 The little fox he murmured,<br>
 'O what is the world's bane?<br>
 The sun was laughing sweetly,<br>
 The moon plucked at my rein;<br>
 But the little red fox murmured,<br>
 'O do not pluck at his rein,<br>
 He is riding to the townland,<br>
 That is the world's bane.'</p>
