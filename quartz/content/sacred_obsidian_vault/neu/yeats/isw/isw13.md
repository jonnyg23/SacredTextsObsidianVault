 <p><font color="RED">I made some of these poems walking about among the Seven Woods, before the big wind of nineteen hundred and three blew down so many trees, &amp; troubled the wild creatures, &amp; changed the look of things; and I thought out there a good part of the play which follows. The first shape of it came to me in a dream, but it changed much in the making, foreshadowing, it may be, a change that may bring a less dream-burdened will into my verses. I never re-wrote anything so many times; for at first I could not make these wills that stream into mere life poetical. But now I hope to do easily much more of the kind, and that our new Irish players will find the buskin and the sock.</font></p>
