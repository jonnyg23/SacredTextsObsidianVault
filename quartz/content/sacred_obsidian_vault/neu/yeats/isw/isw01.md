 <h1 align="CENTER">IN THE SEVEN WOODS: BEING<br>
 POEMS CHIEFLY OF THE<br>
 IRISH HEROIC AGE.</h1>
 <p></p>
 <h3 align="CENTER">IN THE SEVEN WOODS.</h3>
 <p>I have heard the pigeons of the Seven Woods<br>
 Make their faint thunder, and the garden bees<br>
 Hum in the lime tree flowers; and put away<br>
 The unavailing outcries and the old bitterness<br>
 That empty the heart. I have forgot awhile<br>
 Tara uprooted, and new commonness<br>
 Upon the throne and crying about the streets<br>
 And hanging its paper flowers from post to post,<br>
 Because it is alone of all things happy.<br>
 I am contented for I know that Quiet<br>
 Wanders laughing and eating her wild heart<br>
 Among pigeons and bees, while that Great Archer,<br>
 Who but awaits His hour to shoot, still hangs<br>
 A cloudy quiver over Parc-na-Lee.</p>
