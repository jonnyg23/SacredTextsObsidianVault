 <h3 align="CENTER">A LAMENTATION</h3>
 <i></i><p align="CENTER">For the Death of Sir Maurice Fitzgerald, Knight, of Kerry, who was killed in Flanders, 1642.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">FROM THE IRISH, BY CLARENCE MANGAN</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>There was lifted up one voice of woe,<br>
   One lament of more than mortal grief,<br>
 Through the wide South to and fro,<br>
   For a fallen Chief.<br>
 In the dead of night that cry thrilled through me,<br>
   I looked out upon the midnight air?<br>
 My own soul was all as gloomy,<br>
   As I knelt in prayer.</p>
 <p>O'er Loch Gur, that night, once--twice-yea, thrice--<br>
   Passed a wail of anguish for the Brave<br>
 That half curled into ice<br>
   Its moon-mirroring wave.<br>
 Then uprose a many-toned wild hymn in<br>
   Choral swell from Ogra's dark ravine,<br>
 And Mogeely's Phantom Women<br>
   Mourned the Geraldine!</p>
 <p>Far on Carah Mona's emerald plains<br>
   Shrieks and sighs were blended many hours,<br>
 And Fermoy in fitful strains<br>
   Answered from her towers.<br>
 Youghal, Keenalmeaky, Eemokilly,<br>
   Mourned in concert, and their piercing <i>keen</i><br>
 Woke wondering life the stilly<br>
   Glens of Inchiqueen.</p></dir>

 <p>From Loughmoe to yellow Dunanore<br>
   There was fear; the traders of Tralee<br>
 Gathered up their golden store,<br>
   And prepared to flee;<br>
 For, in ship and hall from night till morning,<br>
   Showed the first faint beamings of the sun,<br>
 All the foreigners heard the warning<br>
   Of the Dreaded One!</p>
 <p>"This," they spake, "portendeth death to us,<br>
   If we fly not swiftly from our fate!<br>
 Self-conceited idiots! thus<br>
   Ravingly to prate!<br>
 Not for base-born higgling Saxon trucksters<br>
   Ring laments like those by shore and sea!<br>
 Not for churls with souls like hucksters<br>
   Waileth our Banshee!</p>
 <p>For the high Milesian race alone<br>
   Ever flows the music of her woe!<br>
 For slain heir to bygone throne,<br>
   And for Chief laid low!<br>
 Hark! ... Again, methinks, I hear her weeping<br>
   Yonder! is she near me now, as then?<br>
 Or was but the night-wind sweeping<br>
   Down the hollow glen?</p>
