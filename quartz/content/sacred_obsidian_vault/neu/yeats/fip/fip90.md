 <h3 align="CENTER">FATHER JOHN O'HART.--Page <a href="fip59.htm#page_220">220</a>.</h3>
 <p>Father O'Rorke is the priest of the parishes of Ballysadare and Kilvamet, and it is from his learnedly and faithfully and sympathetically written history of these parishes that I have taken the story of Father John, who had been priest of these parishes, dying in the year 1739. Coloony is a village in Kilvamet.</p>
 <p>Some sayings of Father John's have come down. Once when he was sorrowing greatly for the death of his brother, the people said to him, "Why do you sorrow so for your brother, when you forbid us to keen?" "Nature," he answered, "forces me, but ye force nature." His memory and influence survives, in the fact that to the present day there has been no keening in Coloony.</p>
 <p>He was a friend of the celebrated poet and musician, Carolan.</p>
