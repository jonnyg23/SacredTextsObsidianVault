 <h3 align="CENTER">THE FAIRY THORN</h3>
 <i></i><p align="CENTER">An Ulster Ballad.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">SIR SAMUEL FERGUSON.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"GET up, our Anna dear, from the weary spinning-wheel;<br>
   For your father's on the hill, and your mother is asleep;<br>
 Come up above the crags, and we'll dance a highland-reel<br>
   Around the fairy thorn on the steep."</p>
 <p>At Anna Grace's door 'twas thus the maidens cried,<br>
   Three merry maidens fair in kirtles of the green;<br>
 And Anna laid the rock and the weary wheel aside,<br>
   The fairest of the four, I ween.</p>
 <p>They're glancing through the glimmer of the quiet eve,<br>
   Away in milky wavings of neck and ankle bare;<br>
 The heavy-sliding stream in its sleepy song they leave,<br>
   And the crags in the ghostly air:</p>
 <p>And linking hand in hand, and singing as they go,<br>
   The maids along the hill-side have ta'en their fearless way,<br>
 Till they come to where the rowan trees in lonely beauty grow<br>
   Beside the Fairy Hawthorn grey.</p></dir>

 <p>The Hawthorn stands between the ashes tall and slim,<br>
   Like matron with her twin grand-daughters at her knee;<br>
 The rowan berries cluster o'er her low head grey and dim<br>
   In ruddy kisses sweet to see.</p>
 <p>The merry maidens four have ranged them in a row,<br>
   Between each lovely couple a stately rowan stem,<br>
 And away in mazes wavy, like skimming birds they go,<br>
   Oh, never caroll'd bird like them!</p>
 <p>But solemn is the silence of the silvery haze<br>
   That drinks away their voices in echoless repose,<br>
 And dreamily the evening has still'd the haunted braes,<br>
   And dreamier the gloaming grows.</p>
 <p>And sinking one by one, like lark-notes from the sky<br>
   When the falcon's shadow saileth across the open shaw,<br>
 Are hush'd the maiden's voices, as cowering down they he<br>
   In the flutter of their sudden awe.</p>
 <p>For, from the air above, the grassy ground beneath,<br>
   And from the mountain-ashes and the old Whitethorn between,<br>
 A Power of faint enchantment doth through their beings breathe,<br>
   And they sink down together on the green.</p>
 <p>They sink together silent, and stealing side by side,<br>
   They fling their lovely arms o'er their drooping necks so fair,<br>
 Then vainly strive again their naked arms to hide,<br>
   For their shrinking necks again are bare.</p>
 <p>Thus clasp'd and prostrate all, with their heads together bow'd,<br>
   Soft o'er their bosom's beating--the only human sound--<br>
 They hear the silky footsteps of the silent fairy crowd,<br>
   Like a river in the air, gliding round.</p></dir>

 <p>No scream can any raise, no prayer can any say,<br>
   But wild, wild, the terror of the speechless three--<br>
 For they feel fair Anna Grace drawn silently away,<br>
   By whom they dare not look to see.</p>
 <p>They feel their tresses twine with her parting locks of gold<br>
   And the curls elastic falling as her head withdraws;<br>
 They feel her sliding arms from their tranced arms unfold,<br>
   But they may not look to see the cause:</p>
 <p>For heavy on their senses the faint enchantment lies<br>
   Through all that night of anguish and perilous amaze;<br>
 And neither fear nor wonder can ope their quivering eyes,<br>
   Or their limbs from the cold ground raise,</p>
 <p>Till out of night the earth has roll'd her dewy side,<br>
   With every haunted mountain and streamy vale below;<br>
 When, as the mist dissolves in the yellow morning tide,<br>
   The maidens' trance dissolveth go.</p>
 <p>Then fly the ghastly three as swiftly as they may,<br>
   And tell their tale of sorrow to anxious friends in vain--<br>
 They pined away and died within the year and day,<br>
   And ne'er was Anna Grace seen again.</p>
