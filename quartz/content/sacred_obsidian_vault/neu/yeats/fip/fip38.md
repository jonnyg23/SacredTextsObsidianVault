 <h3 align="CENTER">A LEGEND OF TYRONE.</h3>
 <p align="CENTER">ELLEN O'LEARY.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Crouched round a bare hearth in hard, frosty weather,<br>
 Three lonely helpless weans cling close together;<br>
 Tangled those gold locks, once bonnie and bright--<br>
 There's no one to fondle the baby tonight.</p>
 <p>"My mammie I want; oh! my mammie I want!<br>
 The big tears stream down with the low wailing chant.<br>
 Sweet Eily's slight arms enfold the gold head:<br>
 "Poor weeny Willie, sure mammie is dead--</p></dir>

 <p>And daddie is crazy from drinking all day--<br>
 Come down, holy angels, and take us away!<br>
 Eily and Eddie keep kissing and crying--<br>
 Outside, the weird winds are sobbing and sighing.</p>
 <p>All in a moment the children are still,<br>
 Only a quick coo of gladness from Will.<br>
 The sheeling no longer seems empty or bare,<br>
 For, clothed in soft raiment, the mother stands there.</p>
 <p>They gather around her, they cling to her dress;<br>
 She rains down soft kisses for each shy caress.<br>
 Her light, loving touches smooth out tangled locks,<br>
 And, pressed to her bosom, the baby she rocks.</p>
 <p>He lies in his cot, there's a fire on the hearth;<br>
 To Eily and Eddy 'tis heaven on earth,<br>
 For mother's deft fingers have been everywhere;<br>
 She lulls them to rest in the low <i>suggaun</i> <a name="fr_16"></a><a href="#fn_16"><font size="1">1</font></a> chair.</p>
 <p>They gaze open-eyed, then the eyes gently close,<br>
 As petals fold into the heart of a rose,<br>
 But ope soon again in awe, love, but no fear,<br>
 And fondly they murmur, "Our mammie is here."</p>
 <p>She lays them down softly, she wraps them around;<br>
 They lie in sweet slumbers, she starts at a sound,<br>
 The cock loudly crows, and the spirit's away--<br>
 The drunkard steals in at the dawning of day.</p>
 <p>Again and again, 'tween the dark and the dawn,<br>
 Glides in the dead mother to nurse Willie Bawn:<br>
 Or is it an angel who sits by the hearth?<br>
 An angel in heaven, a mother on earth.</p>
