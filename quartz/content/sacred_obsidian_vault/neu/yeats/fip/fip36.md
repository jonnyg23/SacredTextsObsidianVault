 <h3 align="CENTER">A DREAM.</h3>

 <p>I heard the dogs howl in the moonlight night;<br>
 I went to the window to see the sight;<br>
 All the Dead that ever I knew<br>
 Going one by one and two by two.</p>
 <p>On they pass'd, and on they pass'd;<br>
 Townsfellows all, from first to last;<br>
 Born in the moonlight of the lane,<br>
 Quench'd in the heavy shadow again.</p>
 <p>Schoolmates, marching as when we play'd<br>
 At soldiers once--but now more staid;<br>
 Those were the strangest sight to me<br>
 Who were drown'd, I knew, in the awful sea.</p></dir>

 <p>Straight and handsome folk; bent and weak, too;<br>
 Some that I loved, and gasp'd to speak to;<br>
 Some but a day in their churchyard bed;<br>
 Some that I had not known were dead.</p>
 <p>A long, long crowd--where each seem'd lonely,<br>
 Yet of them all there was one, one only,<br>
 Raised a head or look'd my way.<br>
 She linger'd a moment,--she might not stay.</p>
 <p>How long since I saw that fair pale face!<br>
 Ah! Mother dear! might I only place<br>
 My head on thy breast, a moment to rest,<br>
 While thy hand on my tearful cheek were prest!</p>
 <p>On, on, a moving bridge they made<br>
 Across the moon-stream, from shade to shade,<br>
 Young and old, women and men;<br>
 Many long-forgot, but remember'd then.</p>
 <p>And first there came a bitter laughter;<br>
 A sound of tears the moment after;<br>
 And then a music so lofty and gay,<br>
 That every morning, day by day,<br>
 I strive to recall it if I may.</p>
