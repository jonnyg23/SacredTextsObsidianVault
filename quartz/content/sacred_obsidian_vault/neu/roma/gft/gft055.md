 <p>Resemblances only less strongly marked are observable between Campbell's two stories of 'The Shifty Lad' and 'The Three Widows' and the Welsh-Gypsy story of 'Jack the Robber' (No. 68), between his ' Tale of the Soldier' (given here as a tinker story, <a href="gft134.htm#an_74">No. 74</a>), and my 'Ashypelt' (<a href="gft117.htm#an_57">No. 57</a>), and between his 'Brown Bear of the Green Glen' (<a href="gft133.htm#an_73">No. 73</a> here) and my 'Old King his Three Sons' (<a href="gft115.htm#an_55">No. 55</a>).
