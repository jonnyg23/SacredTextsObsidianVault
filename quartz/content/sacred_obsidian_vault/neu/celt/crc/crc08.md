 <p>Cuchulainn threatened in Methe, that wherever he should see Ailill or Medb afterwards he would throw a stone from his sling at them. He did this then: he threw a stone from his sling, so that he killed the squirrel that was on Medb's shoulder south of the ford: hence is Methe Togmaill. And he killed the bird that was on Ailill's shoulder north of the ford: hence is Methe n-Eoin. (Or it is on Medb's shoulder that both squirrel and bird were together, and it is their heads that were struck from them by the casts.)</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p>Reoin was drowned in his lake. Hence is Loch Reoin.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p>'That other is not far from you,' said Ailill to the Manes.</p>  
 <p>They arose and looked round. When they sat down again, Cuchulainn struck one of them, so that his head broke.</p>  
 <p>'It was well that you went for that: your boasting was not fitting,' said Maenen the fool. 'I would have taken his head off.'</p>  
 <p>Cuchulainn threw a stone at him, so that his head broke. It is thus then that these were killed: Orlam in the first place on his hill; the Meic Garach on their ford; Fertedil in his ———; Maenan in his hill.</p>  
 <p>'I swear by the god by whom my people swear,' said Ailill, 'that man who shall make a mock of Cuchulainn here, I will make two halves of him.'</p>  
 <p>'Go forth for us both day and night,' said Ailill, 'till we reach Cualnge. That man will kill two-thirds of the host in this way.'</p>

 <p>It is there that the harpers of the <i>Cainbili</i> <a name="fr_39"></a><a href="#fn_39"><font size="1">1</font></a> from Ossory came to them to amuse them. They thought it was from the Ulstermen to spy on them. They set to hunting them, till they went before them in the forms of deer into the stones at Liac Mor on the north. For they were wizards with great cunning.</p>
