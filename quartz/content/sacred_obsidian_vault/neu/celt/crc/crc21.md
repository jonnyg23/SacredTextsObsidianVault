 <p>Then Cur Mac Dalath is besought to go against Cuchulainn. He from whom he shed blood, he is dead before the ninth day.</p>  
 <p>'If he slay him,' said Medb, 'it is victory; and though it be he who is slain, it is removing a load from the host: for it is not easy to be with him in regard to eating and sleeping.'</p>  
 <p>Then he goes forth. He did not think it good to go against a beardless wild boy.</p>  
 <p>'Not so(?) indeed,' said he, 'right is the honour (?) that you give us! If I had known that it was against this man that I was sent, I would not have bestirred myself to seek him; it were enough in my opinion for a boy of his own age from my troop to go against him.'</p>  
 <p>'Not so,' said Cormac Condlongas; 'it were a marvel for us if you yourself were to drive him off.'</p>  
 <p>'Howbeit,' said he, 'since it is on myself that it is laid you shall go forth to-morrow morning; it will not delay me to kill the young deer yonder.'</p>  
 <p>He goes then early in the morning to meet him; and he tells the host to get ready to take the road before them, for it was a clear road that he would make by going against Cuchulainn.</p>
