 <center><h1>How Cormac Mac Art went to Faery</h1></center>
   <p>
 CORMAC, son of Art, son of Conn of the Hundred Battles, was
   high King of Ireland, and held his Court at Tara. One day he saw a youth upon
   the green having in his hand a glittering fairy branch with nine apples of
   red. And whensoever the branch was shaken, wounded men and women enfeebled by
   illness would be lulled to sleep by the sound of the very sweet fairy music
   which those apples uttered, nor could any one upon earth bear in mind any
   want, woe, or weariness of soul when that branch was shaken for him.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Is that branch thy own ?" said Cormac. It is indeed
   mine."</p>
 
   <p>
 "Wouldst thou sell it? and what wouldst thou require for
   it ?"</p>
 
   <p>
 "Will you give me what I ask ? " said the youth.</p>
 
 
 <p>
 The king promised, and the youth then claimed
 his wife, his daughter, and his son. Sorrowful of heart was the king, heaviness
 of heart filled his wife and children when they learned that they must part from
 him. But Cormac shook the branch amongst them, and when they heard the soft
 sweet music of the branch they forgot all care and sorrow and went forth to meet
 the youth, and he and they took their departure and were seen no more. Loud
 cries of weeping and mourning were made throughout Erin when this was known but
 Cormac shook the branch so that there was no longer any grief or heaviness of
 heart upon any one.</p>
 
 
 <p>
 After a year Cormac said " It is a year tu day since my
 wife, my son, and my daughter were taken from me. I will follow them by the same
 path that they took."</p>
 
 <p>
 Cormac went off, and a dark magical mist rose about him, and he
 chanced to come upon a wonderful marvellous plain. Many horsemen were there,
 busy thatching a house with the feathers of foreign birds ; when one side was
 thatched they would go and seek more, and when they returned not a feather was
 on the roof. Cormac gazed at them for a while and then went forward.</p>
 
 <p>
 Again, he saw a youth dragging up trees to make a fire but
 before he could find a second tree the first one would be burnt, and it seemed
 to Cormac that his labour would never end.</p>
 
 <p>
 Cormac journeyed onwards until he saw three immense wells on the
 border of the plain, and on each well was a head. From out the mouth of the
 first head there flowed two streams, into it there flowed one; the second head
 had a stream flowing out of and another stream into its mouth, whilst three
 streams were flowing from the mouth of the third head. Great wonder seized
 Cormac, and he said "I will stay and gaze upon these wells, for I should
 find no man to tell me your story." With that he set onwards till he came
 to a house in the middle of a field. He entered and greeted the inmates. There
 sat within a tall couple clad in many-hued garments, and they greeted the king,
 and bade him welcome for the night.</p>
 
 <p>
 Then the wife bade her husband seek food, and he arose and
 returned with a huge wild boar upon his hack and a log in his hand. He cast down
 the swine and the log upon the floor, and said "There is meat ; cook it for
 yourselves."</p>
 
 <p>
 "How can I do that? " said Cormac.</p>
 
 <p>
 "I will teach you," said the youth. "Split this
 great log, make four pieces of it, and make four quarters of the hog; put a log
 under each quarter; tell a true story. and the meat will be cooked."</p>
 
 <p>
 "Tell the first story yourself" said Cormac.</p>
 
 <p>
 "Seven pigs I have of the same kind as the one I brought,
 and I could feed the world with them. For if a pig is killed I have but to put
 its bones into the stye again, and it will be found alive the next
 morning."</p>
 
 <p>
 The story was true, and a quarter of the pig was cooked.</p>
 
 <p>
 Then Cormac begged the woman of the house to tell a story.</p>
 
 <p>
 "I have seven white cows, and they fill seven cauldrons
 with milk every day, and I give my word that they yield as much milk as would
 satisfy the men of the whole world if they were out on yonder plain drinking
 it."</p>
 
 <p>
 That story was true, and a second quarter of the pig was cooked.</p>
 
 <p>
 Cormac was bidden now to tell a story for his quarter, and he
 told how he was upon a search for his wife, his son and his daughter that had
 been borne away from him a year before by a youth with a fairy branch.</p>
 
 <p>
 "If what thou sayest be true," said the man of the
 house, "thou art indeed Cormac, son of Art, son of Conn of the Hundred
 Battles."</p>
 
 <p>
 "Truly I am," quoth Cormac.</p>
 
 <p>
 That story was true, and a quarter of the pig was cooked.</p>
 
 <p>
 "Eat thy meal now," said the man of the house.</p>
 
 <p>
 "I never ate before," said Cormac, "having only
 two people in my company."</p>
 
 <p>
 "Wouldst thou eat it with three others ?"</p>
 
 <p>
 "If they were dear to me, I would," said Cormac.</p>
 
 <p>
 Then the door opened, and there entered the wife and children of
 Cormac : great was his joy and his exultation.</p>
 
 <p>
 Then Manannan mac Lir, lord of the fairy Cavalcade, appeared
 before him in his own true form, and said thus :</p>
 
 <p>
 "I it was, Cormac; who bore away these three from thee. I
 it was who gave thee this branch, all that I might bring thee here. Eat now and
 drink."</p>
 
 <p>
 "I would do so," said Cormac, "could I learn the
 meaning of the wonders I saw to-day."</p>
 
 <p>
 "Thou shalt learn them," said Manannan. "The
 horsemen thatching the roof with feathers are a likeness of people who go forth
 into the world to seek riches and fortune when they return their houses are
 bare, and so they go on for ever. The young man dragging up the trees to make a
 fire is a likeness of those who labour for others much trouble they have, but
 they never warm themselves at the fire. The three heads in the wells are three
 kinds of men. Some there are who give freely when they get freely; some who give
 freely though they get little; some who get much and give little, and they are
 the worst of the three, Cormac," said Manannan.</p>
 
 <p>
 After that Cormac and his wife and his children sat down, and a
 table-cloth was spread before them.</p>
 
 <p>
 "That is a very precious thing before thee," said
 Manannan, "there is no food however delicate that shall be asked of it but
 it shall be had without doubt."</p>
 
 <p>
 "That is well," quoth Cormac.</p>
 
 <p>
 After that Manannan thrust his hand into his girdle and brought
 out a goblet and set it upon his palm. "This cup has this virtue, said he,
 "that when a false story is told before it, it makes four pieces of it, and
 when a true story is related it is made whole again."</p>
 
 <p>
 "Those are very precious things you have, Manannan,"
 said the king.</p>
 
 <p>
 "They shall all be thine," said Manannan, "the
 goblet, the branch and the tablecloth."</p>
 
 <p>
 Then they ate their meal, and that meal was good, for they could
 not think of any meat but they got it upon the tablecloth, nor of any drink but
 they got it in the cup. Great thanks did they give to Manannan.</p>
 
 <p>
 When they had eaten their meal a couch was prepared for them and
 they laid down to slumber and sweet sleep.</p>
 
 <p>
 Where they rose on the morrow morn was in Tara of the kings, and
 by their side were tablecloth, cup, and branch.</p>
 
 <p>
 Thus did Cormac fare at the Court of Manannan, and this is how
 he got the fairy branch.</p>
