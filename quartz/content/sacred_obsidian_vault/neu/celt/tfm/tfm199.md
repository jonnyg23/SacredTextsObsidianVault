 <p align="CENTER">LINES' WRITTEN IN A LADY'S ALBUM</p>
 <blockquote> </blockquote>
 <blockquote>IN those blest days, when free from care, <br>
 And happy as the birds in air,<br>
 I roamed the hills and dales,<br>
 By purling rills oft passed the day,<br>
 Or on green banks recumbent lay,<br>
 Listening the shepherds' tales,</blockquote>
 <blockquote>My fancy, rising on the wing,<br>
 Would visions fair before me bring,<br>
 Of castles high, and towers,<br>
 With knights in radiant panoply,<br>
 And ladies of the beaming eye,<br>
 Within their fragrant bowers;</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Or lead me thence away to shades<br>
 Of woods, and show me, in the glades, <br>
 The cottages serene,<br>
 Where Peace dwelt with Content, among <br>
 The happy, gay Arcadian throng<br>
 That tenanted the scene.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>But whether cot or tower arose <br>
 In vision, at the dawn or close<br>
 Of summer-days, to me,<br>
 The lovely form of woman still<br>
 Shone bright by dale, by mend, by rill, <br>
 Amid my extacy.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>I saw her robed in every grace<br>
 With youth, with loveliness of face,<br>
 And virtue's gentle eye;<br>
 And<i> </i>from her tongue heard accents fail, <br>
 That would the rudest heart enthral, <br>
 And raise emotions high.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>But like the Eastern prince, who loved <br>
 The pictured form of one that moved <br>
 In life full many a year<br>
 Ere he beheld the light, I deemed<br>
 The lovely form of which I dreamed <br>
 Would ne'er to me appear.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>And years came on, and years went by, <br>
 And yet I never found me nigh<br>
 My youthful vision bright.<br>
 I said,--I might as well, I ween,<br>
 Expect to see the Fairy-queen<br>
 Descend, to bless my sight.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>But often, when we hope it least,<br>
 And when our search has well nigh ceased, <br>
 Good fortune will befall:<br>
 So I one evening saw a maid,<br>
 Who every grace and charm displayed <br>
 That decked my <i>Ideal.</i></blockquote>
 <blockquote>Her portrait here I need not show,<br>
 For, reader, thou must surely know<br>
 That peerless, gentle maid:<br>
 To her these lines I consecrate;<br>
 And if she smiles I'II deem, elate,<br>
 My toil far overpaid.</blockquote>
