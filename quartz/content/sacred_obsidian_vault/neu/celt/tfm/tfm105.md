 <p align="CENTER">GREAT BRITAIN</p>
 <blockquote><br>
 <br>
 In old wives dates that in old time did live,<br>
 To whose odde tales much credit men did give,<br>
 Great store of goblins, fairies, bugs, nightmares,<br>
 Urchins and elves to many a house repaires.<br>
 Old Poem.</blockquote>
 <blockquote><br>
 WE use the term Great Britain in a very limited sense, as merely inclusive of those parts of the island whose inhabitants are of Gotho-German origin--England and the Lowlands of Scotland.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>We have already seen that the Anglo-Saxon conquerors of Britain had in their language the terms from which are derived Elf and Dwarf, and the inference is natural that their ideas respecting these beings corresponded with those of the Scandinavians and Germans. The same may be said. of the Picts, who, akin to the Scandinavians, early seized on the Scottish Lowlands. We therefore close our survey of the Fairy Mythology of the Gotho-German race with Great Britain.</blockquote>
