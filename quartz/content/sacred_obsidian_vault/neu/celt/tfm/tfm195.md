 <p align="CENTER">AILEEN A ROON<br>
 (ELLEN MY LOVE)</p>
 <blockquote> </blockquote>
 <blockquote>CARROL O'DALY is the Lochinvar of Ireland. He and Ellen Cavanagh were intimate from childhood. The result was love; but Ellen's father insisted on her marrying a wealthier suitor. On the wedding-night Carrol came disguised as a harper, and played and sung this air, which he had composed for the occasion. Ellen's tenderness revived in full force; she contrived to make her father, the bridegroom, and the guests drink to excess, and by morning she and Carrel were beyond pursuit.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>The following lines were written one evening to gratify a lady who wished to have the writer's idea of what Carrol might have sung. The air is generally known under the name of Robin Adair--</blockquote><dir>
 
 <blockquote>What are the joys wealth and honours bestow?<br>
 Do they endure like true love's steady glow? <br>
 Shadows of vanity, <br>
 Mists of the summer sky, <br>
 Soon they disperse and <i>fly,<br>
 </i>Aileen a roon!</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Time was when Aileen tripped light as the fawn,<br>
 Spying young Carrol approach in the dawn, <br>
 Ere the sun's early beam <br>
 Glittered on lake and stream,--<br>
 Oh! that was bliss supreme,<br>
 Aileen a roon!</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Or when mild even's star beamed in the west, <br>
 Bringing to nature the season of rest--<br>
 At that sweet hour to rove, <br>
 Down by yon spreading grove, <br>
 Breathing forth vows of love,<br>
 Aileen a roon!</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Aileen forgets, but her Carrol more true,<br>
 As these past scenes memory brings to his view. <br>
 Heaves many a heavy sigh, <br>
 Breaking his heart is nigh--<br>
 And canst thou let him die?<br>
 Aileen a roon!</blockquote>
