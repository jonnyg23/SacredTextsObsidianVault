 <p align="CENTER">SIR THYNNE.</p>
 <blockquote> </blockquote>
 <blockquote>AND it was the knight Sir Thynnè,<br>
 He was a knight so grave;<br>
 Whether he were on foot or on horse,<br>
 He was a knight so brave. [a]</blockquote>
 <blockquote>And it was the knight Sir Thynnè<br>
 Went the hart and the hind to shoot,<br>
 So he saw Ulva, the little Dwarf's daughter,<br>
 At the green linden's foot.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>And it was Ulva, the little Dwarf's daughter,<br>
 Unto her handmaid she cried,<br>
 "Go fetch my gold harp hither to me,<br>
 Sir Thynnè I'll draw to my side."</blockquote>
 <blockquote>The first stroke on her gold harp she struck,<br>
 So sweetly she made it ring,<br>
 The wild beasts in the wood and field<br>
 They forgot whither they would spring.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>The next stroke on her gold harp she struck, <br>
 So sweetly she made it ring,<br>
 The little gray hawk that sat on the bough, <br>
 He spread out both his wings.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>The third stroke on her gold harp she struck,<br>
 So sweetly she made it ring,<br>
 The little fish that went in the stream,<br>
 He forgot whither he would swim.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Then flowered the mead, then leafed all,<br>
 'Twas caused by the runic lay; [b]<br>
 Sir Thynnè he struck his spurs in his horse,<br>
 He no longer could hold him away.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>And it was the knight Sir Thynnè,<br>
 From his horse he springs hastily,<br>
 So goeth he to Ulva, the little Dwarf's daughter,<br>
 All under the green linden tree.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>"Here you sit, my maiden fair,<br>
 A rose all lilies above;<br>
 See you can never a mortal man<br>
 Who will not seek your love."</blockquote>
 <blockquote>"Be silent, be silent, now Sir Thynnè,<br>
 With your proffers of love, I pray;<br>
 For I am betrothed unto a hill-king,<br>
 A king all the Dwarfs obey.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>"My true love he sitteth the bill within,<br>
 And at gold tables plays merrily;<br>
 My father he setteth his champions in ring,<br>
 And in iron arrayeth them he.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>"My mother she sitteth the hill within,<br>
 And gold in the chest doth lay;<br>
 And I stole out for a little while,<br>
 Upon my gold harp to play."</blockquote>
 <blockquote>And it was the knight Sir Thynnè,<br>
 He patted her cheek rosie:<br>
 "Why wilt thou not give a kinder reply:<br>
 Thou dearest of maidens, to me?"</blockquote>
 <blockquote>"I can give you no kinder reply;<br>
 I may not myself that allow;<br>
 I am betrothed to a hill-king,<br>
 And to him I must keep my vow."</blockquote>
 <blockquote>And it was Thora, the little Dwarf's wife,<br>
 She at the hill-door looked out,<br>
 And there she saw how the knight Sir Thynnè,<br>
 Lay at the green linden's foot.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>And it was Thora, the little Dwarf's wife,<br>
 She was vext and angry, God wot:<br>
 "What hast thou here in the grove to do?<br>
 Little business, I trow, thou hast got.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>"'Twere better for thee in the hill to be,<br>
 And gold in the chest to lay,<br>
 Than here to sit in the rosy grove, [c]<br>
 And on thy gold harp to play.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>"And 'twere better for thee in the hill to be,<br>
 And thy bride-dress finish sewing,<br>
 Than sit under the lind, and with runic lay<br>
 A Christian man's heart to thee win."</blockquote>
 <blockquote>And it was Ulva, the little Dwarf's daughter,<br>
 She goeth in at the hill-door:<br>
 And after her goeth the knight Sir Thynnè,<br>
 Clothed in scarlet and fur.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>And it was Thora, the little Dwarf's wife,<br>
 Forth a red-gold chair she drew:<br>
 Then she cast Sir Thynnè into a sleep<br>
 Until that the cock he crew.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>And it was Thora, the little Dwarf's wife,<br>
 The five rune-books she took out;<br>
 So she loosed him fully out of the runes,<br>
 Her daughter had bound him about.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>"And hear thou me, Sir Thynnè,<br>
 From the runes thou now art free;<br>
 This to thee I will soothly say,<br>
 My daughter shall never win thee.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>"And I was born of Christian kind,<br>
 And to the hill stolen in;<br>
 My sister dwelleth in Iseland, [d]<br>
 And wears a gold crown so fine.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>"And there she wears her crown of gold,<br>
 And beareth of queen the name;<br>
 Her daughter was stolen away from her,<br>
 Thereof there goeth great fame.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>"Her daughter was stolen away from her,<br>
 And to Berner-land brought in;<br>
 And there now dwelleth the maiden free,<br>
 She is called Lady Hermolin.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>"And never can she into the dance go,<br>
 But seven women follow her;<br>
 And never can she on the gold-harp play,<br>
 If the queen herself is not there.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>"The king he hath a sister's son,<br>
 He hopeth the crown to possess,<br>
 For him they intend the maiden free,<br>
 For her little happiness.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>"And this for my honour will I do<br>
 And out of good-will moreover,<br>
 To thee will I give the maiden free,<br>
 And part her from that lover."</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Then she gave unto him a dress so new,<br>
 With gold and pearls bedight;<br>
 Every seam on the dress it was<br>
 With precious stones all bright.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Then she gave unto him a horse so good,<br>
 And therewith a new sell;<br>
 "And never shalt thou the way inquire,<br>
 Thy horse will find it well."</blockquote>
 <blockquote>And it was Diva, the little Dwarf's daughter,<br>
 She would show her good-wifi to the knight;<br>
 So she gave unto him a spear so new,<br>
 And therewith a good sword so bright.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>"And never shalt thou fight a fight,<br>
 Where thou shalt not the victory gain;<br>
 And never shalt thou sail on a sea<br>
 Where thou shalt not the land attain."</blockquote>
 <blockquote>And it was Thor; the little Dwarf's wife,<br>
 She wine in a glass for him poured:<br>
 "Ride away, ride away, now Sir Thynnè,<br>
 Before the return of my lord."</blockquote>
 <blockquote>And it was the knight Sir Thynnè,<br>
 He rideth under the green hill side,<br>
 There then met him the hill-kings two,<br>
 As slow to the hill they ride.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>"Well met! Good day, now Sir Thynnè!<br>
 Thy horse can well with thee pace;<br>
 Whither directed is thy course?<br>
 Since thou 'it bound to a distant place."</blockquote>
 <blockquote>"Travel shall I and woo;<br>
 Plight me shall I a flower;<br>
 Try shall I my sword so good,<br>
 To my weal or my woe in the stour."</blockquote>
 <blockquote>"Ride in peace, ride in peace, away, Sir Thynnè,<br>
 From us thou hast nought to fear;<br>
 They are coming, the champions from Iseland,<br>
 Who with thee long to break a spear."</blockquote>
 <blockquote>And it was the knight Sir Thynnè,<br>
 He rideth under the green hill side;<br>
 There met him seven Bernisk champions,<br>
 They bid him to halt and abide.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>"And whether shall we fight to-day,<br>
 For the red gold and the silver;<br>
 Or shall we fight together to-day,<br>
 For both our true loves fair?"</blockquote>
 <blockquote>And it was the king's sister's son,<br>
 He was of mood so hasty;<br>
 "Of silver and gold I have enow,<br>
 If thou wilt credit me."</blockquote>
 <blockquote>"But hast thou not a fair true love,<br>
 Who is called Lady Hermolin?<br>
 For her it is we shall fight to-day,<br>
 If she shall be mine or thine."</blockquote>
 <blockquote>The first charge they together rode,<br>
 They were two champions so tall;<br>
 He cut at the king's sister's son,<br>
 That his head to the ground did fall.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Back then rode the champions six,<br>
 And dressed themselves in fur;<br>
 Then went into the lofty hall,<br>
 The aged king before.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>And it was then the aged king,<br>
 He tore his gray hairs in woe.<br>
 "Ye<i> </i>must avenge my sister's son's death;<br>
 I will sables and martins bestow. ' [e]</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Back then rode the champions six,<br>
 They thought the reward to gain,<br>
 But they remained halt and limbless:<br>
 By loss one doth wit obtain.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>And he slew wolves and bears,<br>
 All before the high chamber;<br>
 Then taketh he out the maiden free<br>
 Who so long had languished there.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>And now hath Lady Hermolin<br>
 Escaped from all harm;<br>
 Now sleeps she sweet full many a sleep,<br>
 On brave Sir Thynnè's arm.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>And now has brave Sir Thynnè<br>
 Escaped all sorrow and tine;<br>
 Now sleeps he sweet full many a sleep,<br>
 Beside Lady Hermolin.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Most thanketh he Ulva, the little Dwarf's daughter,<br>
 Who him with the runes had bound,<br>
 For were he not come inside of the bill,<br>
 The lady he never had found. [f]</blockquote>

 <blockquote>[a] We have ventured to omit the Omqued. <i>I styren väll de Runor! </i>(Manage well the runes!) The final <i>e </i>in Thynnè ia marked merely to indicate that it is to be sounded.<br>
 <br>
 [b] <i>Runeslag, </i>literally Rune-stroke. Runes originally signified letters, and then songs. They were of two kinds, Maalrunor <i>(Speech-runes), </i>and Trollrunor <i>(Magic-runes); </i>These last were again divided into Skaderunur <i>(Mischief-runes) </i>and Hjelprunor <i>(Help-runes), </i>of each of which there were five kinds. See Verelius' notes to the Hervarar Saga, cap. 7.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>The power of music over all nature is a subject of frequent recurrence in northern poetry. Here all the wild animals are entranced by the magic tones of the harp; the meads flower, the trees put forth leaves; the knight, though grave and silent, is attracted, and even if included to stay away, he cannot restrain his horse.<br>
 <br>
 [c] <i>Rosendelund. </i>The word <i>Lund </i>signifies any kind of grove, thicket, <i>&amp;c.<br>
 <br>
 </i>[d]<i> </i>Not the island of Iceland, but a district in Norway of that name. By Berner-land, Geijer thinks is meant the land of Bern (Verona), the country of Dietrich, so celebrated in German romance.<br>
 <br>
 [e] <i>Sabel och Mård. </i>These furs are always mentioned In the northern ballads, as the royal rewards of distinguished actions.<br>
 <br>
 [f] This fine ancient Visa was taken down from recitation in West Gothland. The corresponding Danish one of Her Tönne is much later.</blockquote>
