 <p align="CENTER">THE YOUNG SWAIN AND THE ELVES</p>
 <blockquote> </blockquote>
 <blockquote>I WAS a handsome young swain,<br>
 And to the court should ride.<br>
 I rode out in the evening-hour;<br>
 In the rosy grove I to sleep me laid.<br>
 Since I her first saw.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>I laid me under a lind so green,<br>
 My eyes they sunk in sleep;<br>
 There came two maidens going along,<br>
 They fain would with me speak.<br>
 Since I her first saw.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>The one she tapped me on my cheek,<br>
 The other whispered in my ear:<br>
 "Stand up, handsome young swain,<br>
 If thou list of love to hear."<br>
 Since I her first saw.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>They led then forth a maiden,<br>
 Whose hair like gold did shine:<br>
 "Stand up, handsome young swain,<br>
 If thou to joy incline."<br>
 Since I her first saw.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>The third began a song to sing,<br>
 With good will she did so;<br>
 Thereat stood the rapid stream,<br>
 Which before was wont to flow.<br>
 Since I her first saw.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Thereat stood the rapid stream,<br>
 Which before was wont to flow;<br>
 And the hind all with her hair so brown,<br>
 Forgot whither she should go.<br>
 Since I her first saw.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>I got me up from off the ground,<br>
 And leaned my sword upon;<br>
 The Elve-women danced in and out,<br>
 All had they the Elve fashión.<br>
 Since I her first saw.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Had not fortune been to me so good,<br>
 That the cock his wings clapped then,<br>
 I had slept within the hill that night,<br>
 All with the Elve-womén.<br>
 Since I her first saw. [a]</blockquote>

 <blockquote>[a] Svenska Visor, iii. p. 170. This is the Elvesböj of the Danish ballads, translated by Jamieson (i. 225), and by Lewis. In the different Swedish variations, they are Hafsfruen, i. e. Mermaids, who attempt to seduce young men to their love by the offer of costly presents.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>A Danish legend (Thiele, i. 22) relates that a poor man, who was working near Gillesbjerg, a haunted hilt, my down on it to rest himself in the middle of the day. Suddenly there appeared before him a beautiful maiden, with a gold cup in her hand. She made signs to him to come near, but when the man in his fright made the sign of the cross, she was obliged to turn round and then he saw her back that it was hollow.</blockquote>
