 <p align="CENTER">A FAREWELL</p>
 <blockquote> </blockquote>
 <blockquote>FAREWELL! farewell! the parting hour <br>
 Is come, and I must leave thee!<br>
 Oh! ne'er may aught approach thy bower <br>
 That might of bliss bereave thee!</blockquote>
 <blockquote>But ever a perennial rill<br>
 Of joy, so brightly flowing,<br>
 Keep each fair thought in fragrance still <br>
 Within thy pure mind blowing.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>For life all charm had lost for me,<br>
 My thoughts were only sadness,<br>
 When fortune led me unto thee<br>
 To taste once more of gladness.--</blockquote>
 <blockquote>I've seen the sullen shades of night<br>
 Fair nature's face concealing,<br>
 And marked how scattered rays of light <br>
 Came morn's approach revealing.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>The light increased, the orb of day<br>
 Clomb to the mountain's summit;<br>
 And vale and plain, and stream and bay, <br>
 Drew life and lustre from it.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>And as it towered in majesty,<br>
 Light all around it shedding,<br>
 It seemed a monarch, seated high,<br>
 Bliss through his realms wide spreading.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>All nature joyed; I felt my heart<br>
 Distend, and fill with pleasure;<br>
 For heavenly light and warmth impart <br>
 A bliss we cannot measure.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>This glorious sun to me art thou,<br>
 Whose light all gloom dispelleth,<br>
 Before whose majesty I bow<br>
 When he his power revealeth.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Thy golden locks, thine eyes so blue, <br>
 Thy smile so sweetly playing,<br>
 Were those first shafts of light that flew, <br>
 The gloom of night warraying.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>But when, more intimately known,<br>
 I found not only beauty,<br>
 But genius, taste, and truth, thine own, <br>
 Combined with filial duty:</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Then rose the sun, o'er all my soul<br>
 In full effulgence beaming,<br>
 And tides of joy began to roll<br>
 Beneath his radiance gleaming.--</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Time still his noiseless course pursues<br>
 With unremitting vigour,<br>
 And lovely Spring each year renews <br>
 The waste of Winter's rigour.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Were mine the power, thus, like Time, <br>
 To wake again life's flowers,<br>
 And days recall of youthful prime<br>
 Passed in the Muses' bowers;</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Then, lovely maiden! fancy-free,<br>
 Rich in each mental treasure,<br>
 In me thou wouldst a votary see--<br>
 Thy will would be my pleasure.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>But while such bliss might not be mine, <br>
 A friendship pure and holy<br>
 I offered at the hallowed shrine,<br>
 To which my heart turned solely.--</blockquote>
 <blockquote>When distant from thee many a mile,<br>
 High waves between us swelling,<br>
 I'll think upon thy lovely smile,<br>
 Of pure emotion telling.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>The sky will show me thy blue eye; <br>
 The whispering breeze of even<br>
 Recall that voice, whose melody<br>
 Oft lapped my soul in heaven!</blockquote>
 <blockquote>The sinking sun thy ringlets' gold<br>
 Will show; but memory only<br>
 The treasures of thy mind unfold<br>
 To me when musing lonely.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Oh! may I hope that memory, <br>
 That power for ever changing,<br>
 Will make thee sometimes think on me,<br>
 O'er distant mountains ranging?</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Say me not nay; let Fancy cheat<br>
 My soul with bland illusion;<br>
 And let not Doubt my vision sweet<br>
 Dispel by rude intrusion.</blockquote>
