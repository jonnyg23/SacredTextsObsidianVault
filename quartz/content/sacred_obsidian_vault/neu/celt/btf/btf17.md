 <p align="CENTER">The Old Crow &amp; The Young Crow</p>
 <blockquote> </blockquote>
 <blockquote>[169]</blockquote>
 <blockquote>THERE was an old crow teaching a young crow one day, and he said to him, "Now my son," says he, "listen to the advice I'm going to give you. If you see a person coming near you and stooping, mind yourself, and be on your keeping; he's stooping for a stone to throw at you."</blockquote>
 <blockquote>"But tell me," says the young crow, "what should I do if he had a stone already down in his pocket?"</blockquote>
 <blockquote>"Musha, go 'long out of that," says the old crow, "you've learned enough; the devil another learning I'm able to give you."</blockquote>
