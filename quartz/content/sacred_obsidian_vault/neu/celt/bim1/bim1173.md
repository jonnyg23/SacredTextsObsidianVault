 <p>Days of days are the days that are over and above the lunar year, and are thus distributed according to their number; two days of days are given to Alban Arthan, three to Eilir, three to Hevin, and three to Elved. They are free days, and let any one come from where he may, he will be free, without a weapon against him, since there can be no court and law of country on those days.</p>    </body>
