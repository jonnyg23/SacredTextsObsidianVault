 The <cite>Barddas of Iolo Morganwg</cite> is a collection of writings, largely
 forged, about ancient Welsh Bardic and Druidic beliefs.
 Although the author of this work is cited as J. Williams Ab Ithel, he
 was actually the editor, who pieced it together from manuscripts
 written by Iolo Morganwg.
 Iolo Morganwg (1747-1826), itinerant poet and scholar,
 was a key figure in the Druid revival of the 19th century.
 He was personally responsible for reviving the Welsh national
 poetry contest, the Gorsedd.
 On June 21st, 1792, Midsummer evening, Iolo and a dozen other Welsh poets
 gathered on Primrose Hill in London and held the first Gorsedd in hundreds
 of years.
 Iolo was a Welsh patriot and held revolutionary views; he was a personal
 friend of <a href="../../../aor/paine/index.htm">Tom Paine</a>,
 and George Washington subscribed to his first volume
 of poetry.
 He is said to have influenced both William Blake's poetry and
 Robert Grave's

 <cite><a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0374504938/internetsacredte">White Goddess</a></cite>.
 <!-- @-CDEXCL -->

 He revived the concept that the Welsh explorer Madoc discovered America.
 This led to an expedition to Mandan territory in the Great Plains, which
 found no trace of the Welsh, but was one of the
 inspirations for Thomas Jefferson's Lewis and Clarke expedition.</p>
 <p>
 Iolo Morganwg's contributions to world culture are still with us today;
 there is an extensive neo-Druid movement; and the Gorsedd (and Welsh
 nationalism) are still going strong.
 The Gorsedd is held annually during the Eisteddfod in Wales, a festival
 of Welsh culture.
 Two other Celtic regions, Cornwall and Brittany, have
 also adopted the Gorsedd.
 </p>
 <p>
 Iolo Morganwg, born Edward Williams, a native speaker of both English and Welsh,
 spent his entire life collecting and transcribing
 mediaeval Welsh documents, as well as writing poetry under his own byline.
 He was also a first-rate literary forger of ancient Welsh;
 some have commented that
 his forgeries were as good or better than the real thing.
 Furthermore, he wrote much of the <cite>Barddas</cite>
 under the influence of laudanum (an opium-based medication
 which he took for asthma).
 Scholars have spent two centuries trying to establish which
 parts of his extensive writings purporting to be based on ancient
 manuscripts are genuine, and which he wrote personally.
 Our understanding is still very murky.
 For these reasons, Iolo's writings are considered highly controversial.
 </p>
 <p>
 Because Druidic beliefs were exclusively transmitted orally,
 we have no primary accounts of it, so there is practically
 nothing to compare this text with.
 What we do know is summarized neatly in the Preface to this work,
 and consists of a few excerpts from classical authors.
 The longest account is from Julius Caesar,
 who was more interested in exterminating
 Druids, so he was hardly a disinterested observer.
 </p>
 <p>
 However, this is one of those <i>visionary</i>
 texts which is worth reading for its own merits,
 irrespective of whether it is 'genuine' or not. 
 Taken at face value, the <cite>Barddas</cite> remains a fascinating text.
 It has resonances with the <a href="../../../hin/upan/index.htm">Upanishads</a>,
 <a href="../../../jud/index.htm#kabbalah">Kabbalah</a>,
 and <a href="../../../mas/index.htm">Freemasonry</a>.
 The Bardic alphabet presented in the 'Symbol' section is completely
 invented, based on Runic and Ogham, and has utility as a magical alphabet.
 However it is about as genuine as the alphabets of <a href="../../../ring/index.htm">J.R.R. Tolkien</a>.
 The 'Theology' section appears to be based on Iolo's peculiar Christian
 views (he described himself as a Unitarian Quaker).
 'Theology' also contains a great number of Triads, some of which may
 be from authentic ancient Bardic lore.
 The 'Wisdom' section has a great deal of
 mythopoetic information, some of which is authentic, some not.
 The <cite>Barddas</cite> is great
 reading if you are at all interested in the ancient
 Druids, as long as you keep in mind the background of its creation.

 Production notes:
 I have omitted the Welsh text of this book, which was printed on the
 even numbered pages, but retained all page numbers.
 The English footnotes often started on the facing (preceding)
 page and occasionally continue
 on for several pages, so I have taken
 care to document page numbers in footnotes.
 I have omitted sporadic footnotes which were only relevant to the
 Welsh text, except in a few cases where they also impact the understanding
 of the English translation.
 These footnotes use asterisks instead of numbers.
