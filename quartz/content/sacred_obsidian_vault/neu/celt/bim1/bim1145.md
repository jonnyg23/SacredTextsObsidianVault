 <p>1. There are three Persons in heaven: the Father; the Son; and the Holy Ghost.</p>  
 <p>2. There are three particular ones: the one true element, the necessary deluge; the one element, from which all men proceed, namely, the earth; and the one element of life, namely God.</p>  
 <p>3. There are three particular twos: the two particular stars, namely, the sun and moon; and the two elements, into which all men will go, namely, the heaven and the earth. <a name="fr_359"></a><a href="#fn_357"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>4. There are three particular threes, namely: the three days that Adam and Eve were taken from. <a name="fr_360"></a><a href="#fn_358"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>

 <p>5. There are three particular fours: the four materials of man, namely, fire, air, water, and earth.</p>  
 <p>6. There are three particular fives: the five senses of man; the five books of Moses; and the five zones of the earth. <a name="fr_361"></a><a href="#fn_359"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>7. There are three particular sixes, namely: the six ages of the world; the six stone vessels, the water in which Jesus turned into wine, at the marriage feast of John the Evangelist; <a name="fr_362"></a><a href="#fn_360"><font size="1">2</font></a> and the six perceptions of man.</p>  
 <p>8. The three particular sevens: the seven sacraments of the Church; the seven petitions of Pater Noster; and the seven days of the week.</p>  
 <p>9. The three particular eights: the eight deadly sins; the eight that went with Noah into the ark; and the eight winds.</p>  
 <p>10. The three particular nines: the nine waves of the ocean; the nine graces of heaven; and the nine months of gestation.</p>  
 <p>11. Three particular tens: the ten commandments; the ten lengths of numeration; <a name="fr_363"></a><a href="#fn_361"><font size="1">3</font></a> and the ten degrees of God.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_358"></a><a href="bim1145.htm#fr_360">395:2</a> The meaning of this statement is not very clear. We are not sure whether it is intended that our first parents were expelled from Paradise within three days of their creation, or whether they were deprived of the holy enjoyment of three days, or portions of days, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, that closed the first week of time. Or are we to understand that Adam and Eve were formed out of the constituents or elements of three days? The first notion would not be consistent with the opinion that generally prevailed in the middle ages, which represents them as having continued but seven hours in their state of <a name="page_395"><font size="1" color="green">p. 395</font></a> innocency. " Et ut tradunt historiagraphi eos fuisse in Paradiso per vii. horas et non ultra et statim ejecti sunt." Eulog. Hist. c. viii.</p>
