 <p>1. The first, earth, from which are every corporeity and hardness, and every firm foundation;</p>  
 <p>2. The second, water, from which are all humour and freshness;</p>  
 <p>3. The third, air, from which are all respiration and motion;</p>  
 <p>4. The fourth, sun, from which are all heat and light;</p>  
 <p>5. The fifth, nwyvre, from which are all feeling, affection, and wantonness;</p>  
 <p>6. The sixth, the Holy Ghost, from Whom are all understanding, reason, awen, and sciences;</p>  
 <p>7. The seventh, God, from Whom are all life, strength, and support, for ever and ever.</p>  
 <p>And from these seven primary materials are every existence and animation; and may the whole be under God's regulation. Amen.</p>
