 <p>There are three kinds of stars: fixed stars, which keep their places, and are also called stationary stars; erratic stars, which are called planets, and are fifteen in number, seven <a name="fr_369"></a><a href="#fn_367"><font size="1">2</font></a> being always visible, and eight invisible, except very seldom, because they revolve within and beyond the Galaxy; and the third are irregular stars, which are called comets, and nothing is known of their place, number, and time, nor are they themselves known, except on occasions of chance, and in the course of ages.</p>
