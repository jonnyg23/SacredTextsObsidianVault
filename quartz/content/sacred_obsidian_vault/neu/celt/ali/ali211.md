 <p align="CENTER">Tober-na-Dara</p>
 <i><blockquote>Tober-na-Dara </blockquote></i>(the well of tear's) was so called because it overflowed one time for a mile round, from the tears of the Irish wives and mothers who came there to weep for their fallen kindred, who had been slain in a battle, fighting against Cromwell's troopers of the English army.
