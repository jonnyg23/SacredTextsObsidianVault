 <p align="CENTER">For Pains</p>
 <blockquote>"I kill the evil; I kill the worm in the flesh, the worm in the grass. I put a venomous charm in the murderous pain. The charm that was set by Peter and Paul; the charm that kills the worm in the flesh, in the tooth, in the body."</blockquote>
 <blockquote>This oration to be said three times, while the patient is rubbed with butter on the place of the pain.</blockquote>
 <i><blockquote>Another.</blockquote>
 </i><blockquote>A happy mild charm, a charm which Christ discovered. The charm that kills the worm in the flesh.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>"May Peter take, may Paul take, may Michael take, the pain away, the cruel pain that kills the back and the life, and darkens the eyes."</blockquote>
 <blockquote>This oration written, and tied to a hare's foot, is always to be worn by the person afflicted, hung round the neck.</blockquote>
