 <p align="CENTER">The Poet's Malediction</p>
 <blockquote>The imprecations of the poets had often also a mysterious and fatal effect.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>King Breas, the pagan monarch, was a fierce, cruel, and niggardly man, who was therefore very unpopular with the people, who hate the cold heart and the grudging hand.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Amongst others who suffered by the king's inhospitality, was the renowned Carbury the poet, son of Eodain, the great poetess of the Tuatha-de-Danann race; she who chanted the song of victory when her people conquered the Firbolgs, on the plains of Moytura; and the stone that she stood on, during the battle, in sight of all the warriors, is still existing, and is pointed out as the stone of Eodain the poetess, with great reverence, even to this day.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>It was her son, Carburv the poet, who was held in such high honour by the nation, that King Breas invited him to his court, in order that he might pronounce a powerful malediction over the enemy with whom he was then at war.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Carbury came on the royal summons, but. in place of being treated with the distinction due to his high rank, he was lodged and fed so meanly that the soul of the poet raged with wrath for the king gave him for lodgement only a small stone cell with-out fire or a bed; and for food he had only three cakes of meal without any flesh meat or sauce, and no wine was given him, such wine as is fit to light up the poet's soul before the divine mystic spirit of song can awake in its power within him. So very early the next morning, the poet rose up and departed, with much rage in his heart. But as he passed the king's house he stopped, and in place of a blessing, pronounced a terrible malediction over Breas and his race, which can still be found in the ancient books of Ireland, commencing thus--</blockquote><dir>
 
 <blockquote>"Without fire, without bed, on the surface of the floor!<br>
 Without meat, without fowl, on the surface of the dish.<br>
 Three little dishes and no flesh thereon,<br>
 A cell without bed, a dish without meat, a cup without wine,<br>
 Are these fit offerings from a king to a poet?<br>
 May the king and his race be three times accursed for ever and for ever!"</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Immediately three large blisters rose on the king's forehead, and remained there as a sign and mark of the poet's vengeance.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>And from that day forth to his death, which happened not long after, the reign of Breas was a time of sore trouble and disaster, for he was three times defeated by his enemies, and from care and sorrow a grievous disease fell on him; for though hungry he could not swallow any food; and though all the meat and wine of the best was set before him, yet his throat seemed closed, and though raging with hunger yet not a morsel could pass his lips; and so he died miserably, starved in the midst of plenty, and accursed in all things by the power and malediction of the angry poet.</blockquote></dir>
