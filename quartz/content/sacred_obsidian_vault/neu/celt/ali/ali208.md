 <p align="CENTER">The Bride's Well</p>
 <blockquote>NEAR the last-named well is the Bride's Well, <i>Tober Breda </i>(the holy well of St. Bridget). There is a stone oratory here of fabulous antiquity, with a doorway fashioned after the Egyptian model, sloping towards the top; also an ancient white-thorn covered with votive offerings, amongst which one may see many a long lock of the splendid dark hair of the Irish southern women, who adopt this antique traditional symbol of self-sacrifice to show their gratitude to the patron saint.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>St. Bridget took the name of time pagan goddess Brighita in order to destroy and obliterate the idolatrous rites and transfer the devotion of the people to the Christian ceremonies, and <i>Tober-Breda </i>is now considered of the highest sanctity, being under the Special patronage of St. Bridget.</blockquote>
