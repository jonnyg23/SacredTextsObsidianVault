 <center><h1>The Death Coach</h1></center>
   <p>
 'T IS midnight ! - how gloomy and dark !<br>
 
   By Jupiter there 's not a star! -<br>
 
   'T is fearful ! - 't is awful ! - and hark !<br>
 
   What sound is that comes from afar?</p>
 
   <p>
 Still rolling and rumbling, that sound<br>
 
   Makes nearer and nearer approach;<br>
 
   Do I tremble, or is it the ground? -<br>
 
   Lord save us ! - what is it ? - a coach ! -</p>
 
   <p>
 A coach ! - but that coach has no head;<br>
 
   And the horses are headless as it :<br>
 
   Of the driver the same may he said<br>
 
   And the passengers inside who sit.</p>
 
   <p>
 See the wheels! how they fly o'er the stones!<br>
 
   And whirl, as the whip it goes crack :<br>
 
   Their spokes are of dead men's thigh bones,<br>
 
   And the pole is the spine of the back!</p>
 
   <p>
 The hammer-cloth, shabby display,<br>
 
   Is a pall rather mildew'd by damps;<br>
 
   And to light this strange coach on its way,<br>
 
   Two hollow sculls hang up for lamps !</p>
 
   <p>
 From the gloom of Rathcooney church-yard,<br>
 
   They dash down the hill of Glanmire;<br>
 
   Pass Lota in gallop as hard<br>
 
   As if horses were never to tire I</p>
 
   <p>
 With people thus headless 't is fun<br>
 
   To drive in such furious career;<br>
 
   Since <i>headlong</i> their horses can't run,<br>
 
   Nor coachman be <i>headdy</i> from beer.</p>
 
   <p>
 Very steep is the Tivoli lane,<br>
 
   But up-hill to them is as down;<br>
 
   Nor the charms of Woodhill can detain<br>
 
   These Dullahans rushing to town.</p>
 
   <p>
 Could they feel as I've felt - in a song -<br>
 
   A spell that forbade them depart;<br>
 
   They 'd a lingering visit prolong,<br>
 
   And after their head lose their heart!</p>
 
   <p>
 No matter ! - 't is past twelve o'clock;<br>
 
   Through the streets they sweep on like the wind,<br>
 
   And, taking the road to Blackrock,<br>
 
   Cork city is soon left behind.</p>
 
   <p>
 Should they hurry thus reckless along,<br>
 
   To supper instead of to bed,<br>
 
   The landlord will surely be wrong,<br>
 
   If he charge it at so much a head!</p>
 
   <p>
 Yet mine host may suppose them too poor<br>
 
   To bring to his wealth an increase;<br>
 
   As till now, all who drove to his door,<br>
 
   Possess'd at least <i>one crown</i> a-piece.</p>
 
   <p>
 Up the Deadwoman's hill they are roll'd;<br>
 
   Boreenmannah is quite out of sight;<br>
 
   Ballintemple they reach, and behold !<br>
 
   At its church-yard they stop and alight.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Who 's there?" said a voice from the ground<br>
 
   "We've no room, for the place is quite full."<br>
 
   "O ! room must be speedily found,<br>
 
   For we come from the parish of Skull.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Though Murphys and Crowleys appear<br>
 
   On headstones of deep-letter'd pride;<br>
 
   Though Scannels and Murleys lie here,<br>
 
   Fitzgeralds and Toomies beside;</p>
 
   <p>
 Yet here for the night we lie down,<br>
 
   To-morrow we speed on the gale;<br>
 
   For having no heads of our own,<br>
 
   We seek the Old Head of Kinsale."</p>
