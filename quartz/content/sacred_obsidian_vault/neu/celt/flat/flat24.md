 <center><h1>Cormac and Mary</h1></center>
   <p>
 SHE is not dead - she has no grave -<br>
 
   She lives beneath Lo ugh Corrib's water [Galway];<br>
 
   And in the murmur of each wave<br>
 
   Methinks I catch the songs I taught her."</p>
 
   <p>
 Thus many an evening on the shore<br>
 
   Sat Cormac raving wild and lowly;<br>
 
   Still idly muttering o'er and o'er,<br>
 
   She lives, detain'd by spells unholy.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Death claims her not, too fair for
   earth,<br>
 
   Her spirit lives - alien of heaven;<br>
 
   Nor will it know: a second birth<br>
 
   When sinful mortals are forgiven !</p>
 
   <p>
 Cold is this rock - the wind comes chill,<br>
 
   And mists the gloomy waters cover;<br>
 
   But oh! her soul is colder still -<br>
 
   To lose her God - to leave her lover ! "</p>
 
   <p>
 The lake was in profound repose,<br>
 
   Yet one white wave came gently curling,<br>
 
   And as it reach'd the shore, arose<br>
 
   Dim figures - banners gay unfurling.</p>
 
   <p>
 Onward they move, an airy crowd:<br>
 
   Through each thin form a moonlight ray shone;<br>
 
   While spear and helm, in pageant proud,<br>
 
   Appear in liquid undulation.</p>
 
   <p>
 Bright barbed steeds curvetting tread<br>
 
   Their trackless way with antic capers;<br>
 
   And curtain clouds hang overhead,<br>
 
   Festoon'd by rainbow-colour'd vapours.</p>
 
   <p>
 And when a breath of air would stir<br>
 
   That drapery of Heaven's. own wreathing,<br>
 
   Light wings of prismy gossamer<br>
 
   Just moved and sparkled to the breathing.</p>
 
   <p>
 Nor wanting was the choral song,<br>
 
   Swelling in silv'ry chimes of sweetness;<br>
 
   To sound of which this subtile throng<br>
 
   Advanced in. playful grace and fleetness.</p>
 
   <p>
 With music's strain, all came and went<br>
 
   Upon poor Cormac's doubting vision;<br>
 
   Now rising in wild merriment,<br>
 
   Now softly fading in derision.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Christ, save her soul," he
   boldly cried;<br>
 
   And when that blessed name was spoken,<br>
 
   Fierce yells and fiendish shrieks replied,<br>
 
   And vanished all, - the spell was broken.</p>
 
   <p>
 And now on Corrib's lonely shore,<br>
 
   Freed by his word from power of faery,<br>
 
   To life, to love, restored once more,<br>
 
   Young Cormac welcomes back his Mary.</p>
