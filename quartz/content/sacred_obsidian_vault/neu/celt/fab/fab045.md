 Over the head of Gwen; before his covering over with sod,<br>

 <p>II. The three best men in their country,<br>
 To defend their homesteads,--<br>
 Eithir, and Erthir, and Argad.</p>
 <p>III. The three sons of Llywarch, three intractable ones in battle.<br>
 Three fierce contenders,--<br>
 Llew, and Araw, and Urien.</p>

 <p>IV. Better may it fare for my concerns,<br>
 That he be left on the banks of the river,<br>
 With a host of warlike men.</p>

 The support of battle, and the lamp of benevolence,<br>
 Father of heaven, increase Thou his energy!</p>
 <p>VI. The best three men under heaven<br>
 To defend their homes,--<br>
 Pyll, and Selyv, and Sandev.</p>
 <p>VII. The morning with the dawn of day,<br>
 When Mwg Mawr Drefydd was assaulted,<br>
 The steeds of Mechydd were not trained up.</p>
 <p>VIII. They met around Cavall;<br>
 A corpse is there in blood through injustice,<br>
 From the rencounter of Rhun and the other hero.</p>
 <p>IX. A shout will be uttered on the top of Mount Llug<br>
 Over the grave of Cynllug;<br>
 The reproach is mine; it was I that caused it.</p>
 <p>X. Let the snow descend and cover the vale,<br>
 Warriors will hasten to battle;<br>
 I do not go; infirmity leaves me not.</p>
 <p>XI. Thou art not a scholar, thou art not a recluse<br>
 Thou wilt not be called a monarch in the day of necessity;<br>
 Alas! Cynddilig, that thou wert not a woman.</p>
 <p>XII. Far away is Aber Llyw,<br>
 Further are the two Cyvedlyws;<br>
 Talan, this day thou hast paid me with tears.</p>
