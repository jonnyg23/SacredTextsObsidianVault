 <p align="CENTER">HERE BEGINNETH THE GORCHAN OF TUDVWLCH.</p>
 <p>THEY assemble in arms, the ranks are formed, tumult approaches;<br>
 In front are the warlike, in front the noble, in front the good;<br>
 While the trenches are full of motion, around are heard the curved horns, and are seen the curved falchions;<br>
 To the praise of the king with the host whose presence is devastation.<br>
 I saw dark gore arising on the stalks of plants, on the clasp of the fetter,<br>
 On the bunches, on the sovereign, on the bush, and the spear:<br>
 And ruddy was the sea-beach; and on the sea-beach, and in Ewionydd<br>
 And Gwynheidyd splendid excess prevailed.<br>
 The crowd made a firm stay before the ceremony, like the checking of excess.<br>
 10 Uplifted were the shields around the front of the aged when the excess prevailed.<br>
 A wolf in his lifetime was Bleiddiad, unrestrained in his bravery.<br>
 Active were the glittering shafts with the aspect of a serpent, from the radiance of serpents.<br>
 Wounded thou art, commander of rulers, and delight of females.<br>
 Thou lovedst partly to live: I wish thou livedst, O thou of victorious energy! <a name="page_411"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 411</font></a><br>
 Unjustly oppressed bull (of conflict), I deplore thy death, thou who wert fond of the tumult!<br>
 In the face of the sea, in the front rank of men, around the pit of battle<br>
 Bran combats in Cynwyd.<br>
 A wave burst forth which afflicted the world.<br>
 He refused to the tribes of the country, and for the benefit of the infantry,<br>
 20 Four multitudes, four military troops of the world.<br>
 The shields were in splinters, and the blade in the hair of one from the square,<br>
 The man who poured the expressed mead out of the blue horns,<br>
 A man of quality, surrounded with purple, the stay or armies.<br>
 It was the performance of Tudvwlch of severe aspect, whose standard was of the colour of the blood of grapes.<br>
 By reason of mead free drunk, a multitude went over the boundary.<br>
 In the action at the goal, for the preservation of law.<br>
 Cynan, the energetic chief from Mona, acted justly as regards the higher orders.<br>
 Tudvwlch and Cyvwlch made breaches in the heights of Caers;<br>
 With Mynyddawg disastrous did their wassails prove.<br>
 30 A year of longing for the men of Catraeth is cherished by me;--<br>
 Their steel blades, their mead, their vehemence, and their fetters.<br>
 They assemble in arms, the ranks are formed; do I not hear the tumult?</p>
 <p align="CENTER">AND SO IT ENDETH.</p>
