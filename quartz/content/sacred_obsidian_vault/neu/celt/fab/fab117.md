 <h3 align="CENTER">THE ROD OF MOSES.</h3>
 <h3 align="CENTER">BOOK OF TALIESSIN XXIV.</h3>
 <p align="CENTER"></p>
 <p>FROM every return his host of brothers he rencountered,<br>
 Advantage acknowledged to Christ the Ruler, portion of praise.<br>
 The glorious God sits on the lap of Mary his counterpart.<br>
 The course of truth, perfect nobility, a pattern of thee.<br>
 Rods of Jesse, thy people Judah rencountered,<br>
 .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .<br>
 Dexterous Lord, courteous, faultless, of gentle concord.<br>
 In respect of the earth, in the temple of Solomon, foundation of impulse,<br>
 10 The door of Paradise; shepherd of God; profoundly he reigned.<br>
 Was it not heard from learned prophets<br>
 That the birth of Jesus had taken place; during his life,<br>
 That there would be life to all kings, a life prepared or ready.<br>
 Before thou wouldst have caused, if I had not recorded the danger.<br>
 He brought what was bright; he did not cease from the earth.<br>
 On the sea deep, when descended thy emotion.<br>
 A country native, brought not the greatly-kind; be to me from thee<br>
 The greatness of thy tribulation be to me thy grace, rods of Jesse,<br>
 And the grace of Jesus, glittering its flowers. <a name="page_562"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 562</font></a><br>
 20 Great miracle in his mind from the gifts of God,<br>
 He was a judge; a judge he was; a dexterous divine.<br>
 A man of counsel to every obedient one against falsehood.<br>
 He is a bright tenure of a number of generations.<br>
 .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .<br>
 .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .<br>
 Bold will be the opposition to the only Son of Mary, to worship the Lord.<br>
 The youth ready to assist, from God he sprang, whether he be knowing, whether he be simple.<br>
 Thy foreholding, coeval with perfect trees,<br>
 Had been expanded beautifully from the lap of Jesus.<br>
 30 .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .<br>
 And to give grace, the king of sons,<br>
 A new melody men will not greatly listen to.<br>
 True his grace, a youth of support, without a lord.<br>
 The evolver of every elevation before Druids.<br>
 Nudris they knew not, a gentle sight to see Mabon.<br>
 They brought frankincense and hard gold from Ethiopia.<br>
 O fate-impelling God, O God the ruler, king of the states of progression!<br>
 The cruel Herod was not oppressive in the shroud of death.<br>
 Thy pained failure, a country owning sons,<br>
 40 When the Lord went away, when overwhelmed<br>
 Nilus, and a wintry blast brought Herod to the grave.<br>
 Perfect nobleness in the city of Nazareth,<br>
 He went not to a country possessing melody.<br>
 There will be a resuscitation; may I be bold in thy grace, in the country of the exalted company.<br>
 The birth of the Lord was brought by the possessor of a legion of angels.</p>
