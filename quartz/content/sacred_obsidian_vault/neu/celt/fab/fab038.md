 <h3 align="CENTER">THE PRAISE OF TALIESSIN.</h3>
 <h3 align="CENTER">BOOK OF TALIESSIN XII.</h3>
 <p align="CENTER"></p>
 <p>MESSENGERS to me are come, so numerously are they sent,<br>
 We shall bring a mutual conflict, so great is my bosom.<br>
 Like the effect of the oar in the brine is the liquor of Beli, <a name="page_301"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 301</font></a><br>
 Like a light shield on the back of a shadow.<br>
 Like wrath and indignation from the protection<br>
 Of a Caer, and nine hundred governors became dead.<br>
 There will be a battle on Menei, a vehement retribution.<br>
 There will be more on Conwy, the scar of angry strife shall cause it<br>
 Cold death the destiny of the ready muse,<br>
 10 From the vehement blade by the stroke of Edyrn.<br>
 Three elegant unrestrainable, fell, heavily laden with forces,<br>
 There fleets in the stream, an omen of the day of gloom.<br>
 Three evenings of battle for three proper<br>
 Countries: a boat was made a burying place.<br>
 Three of every three: three sins<br>
 And Eryri a hill of judgment.<br>
 A host of Saxons: the second they were, a third affliction.<br>
 In Cymry widowhood awaits women.<br>
 Before the presence of Cynan fire broke out.<br>
 20 Cadwaladyr will bewail him.<br>
 He injured the country with pain,<br>
 Straw; and roof of houses; the house he burnt.<br>
 There will be a wonder.<br>
 A man with the daughter of his brother.<br>
 They will cite what is steel<br>
 Of the lineage of Anarawd.<br>
 From him proceeded<br>
 Coch, wise his prudence.<br>
 He will not spare nor defend<br>
 30 Either cousin or brother.<br>
 At the voice of the warrior's horn,<br>
 Nine hundred (were) anxious,<br>
 Of universal affliction.<br>
 Thou wilt be calling forth verdancy from affected praise,<br>
 It will run to such as is oppressed in bosom.</p>
