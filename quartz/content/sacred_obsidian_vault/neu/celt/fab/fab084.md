 <h3 align="CENTER">LXIX.</h3>
 <h3 align="CENTER">RED BOOK OF HERGEST XIX.</h3>
 <p>Soon it will happen that kindred by nature will be in the shout of war,<br>
 Soon will happen many a cut from the tournament;<br>
 Soon will come between Saxons a recoil<br>
 From mutual wounding, irreverent burying and ministering;<br>
 Soon will the men of Manaw come to obtain praise,<br>
 And the North they will certainly make without peace.<br>
 Soon will be in Prydein anxiety and want,<br>
 And around Lloegyr they will loudly complain;<br>
 For the falling of the son of Henri they will be amazed;<br>
 10 So great in the dispersion will be the trepidation!<br>
 Scattered over seas, a number of legions they will chase away.<br>
 Tumult will be on the borders, arrogance they will not respect.<br>
 And I will predict that they will energetically shout;<br>
 The innocent like the guilty, they will hew down.<br>
 With great ambition the navy of Lloegyr they will attack;<br>
 Barbarous hosts, plunder they will seek;<br>
 With open violence they will reduce towers,<br>
 And strongholds they will make weak.<br>
 In front of the host of the tournament,<br>
 20 For the contention of one day a myriad will fall;<br>
 On the seas they will openly cause destruction.<br>
 As for me, I will predict that children will not multiply, <a name="page_493"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 493</font></a><br>
 And it is not I that conceal that they will not be dispersed.<br>
 An age of repose the Creator will cause to be, and their extinction;<br>
 The Brythyon will scatter them, chief they will be.<br>
 Tribulation will ensue from the anger of relatives,<br>
 And the Saxons will be joyful when they see it.<br>
 The omen promises to shorten it while they will be.</p>
