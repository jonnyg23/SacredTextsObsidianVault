 <h3 align="CENTER">XLVII.</h3>
 <h3 align="CENTER">THE AFFAIR OF ARGOED LLWYFAIN.</h3>
 <h3 align="CENTER">BOOK OF TALIESSIN XXXV.</h3>
 <p align="CENTER"></p>
 <p>IN the morning of Saturday there was a great battle,<br>
 From when the sun rose until it gained its height.<br>
 Flamdwyn hastened in four hosts<br>
 Godeu and Reged to overwhelm.<br>
 They extended from Argoed to Arvynyd.<br>
 They retained not life during one day.<br>
 Flamdwyn called out again, of great impetuosity,<br>
 Will they give hostages? are they ready?<br>
 Owen answered, Let the gashing appear,<br>
 10 They will not give, they are not, they are not ready.<br>
 And Ceneu, son of Coel, would be an irritated lion<br>
 Before he would give a hostage to any one. <a name="page_366"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 366</font></a><br>
 Urien called out again, the lord of the cultivated region,<br>
 If there be a meeting for kindred,<br>
 Let us raise a banner above the mountain,<br>
 And advance our persons over the border.<br>
 And let us raise our spears over the heads of men,<br>
 And rush upon Flamdwyn in his army,<br>
 And slaughter with him and his followers.<br>
 20 And because of the affair of Argoed Llwyfain,<br>
 There was many a corpse.<br>
 The ravens were red from the warring of men.<br>
 And the common people hurried with the tidings.<br>
 And I will divine the year that I am not increasing.<br>
 And until I fail in old age,<br>
 In the sore necessity of death,<br>
 May I not be smiling,<br>
 If I praise not Urien.</p>
