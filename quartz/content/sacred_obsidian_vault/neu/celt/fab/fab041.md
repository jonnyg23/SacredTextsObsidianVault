 <p>I. I WILL pray God to deliver the people of the fair (town),<br>
 The owner of heaven and earth, ill-wise pervader. <a name="page_304"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 304</font></a><br>
 A pleasant Caer there is on the surface of the ocean.<br>
 May be joyful in the splendid festival its king.<br>
 And the time when the sea makes great audacity.<br>
 The crowns of bards are usual over mead-vessels.<br>
 A wave will come, in haste, speed unto it,<br>
 That will bring them to the green sward from the region of the Ffichti.<br>
 And may I obtain, O God, for my prayer,<br>
 When I keep the covenant of conciliation with thee.</p>
 <p>II. A pleasant Caer there is on a broad lake,<br>
 A fortress impregnable, the sea surrounds it.<br>
 Prydain greets thee: how will these agree?<br>
 The point of the lake of the son of Erbin; be thine the oxen.<br>
 There has been a retinue, and there has been song, in the second place,<br>
 And an eagle, high in the sky, and the path of Granwyn,<br>
 Before the governing sovereign, that refuses not to start,<br>
 The dispersed of renown, and a leader, they form themselves.</p>
 <p>III. A pleasant Caer there is on the ninth wave,<br>
 Pleasant its denizens in guarding each other.<br>
 They will not take them if it be through disgrace.<br>
 It is not their custom to be hard.<br>
 I will not speak falsely, upon my privilege,<br>
 Than the tenants of the two strands better the serfs of Dyved,<br>
 An associate, if he gives a banquet of deliverers,<br>
 Will contain between every two the best multitude.</p>
 <p>IV. A pleasant Caer there is, it will be made complete<br>
 By meads, and praise, and mountain-birds. <a name="page_305"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 305</font></a><br>
 Smooth its songs, on its festival,<br>
 And my intelligent Lord, a splendid distributor,<br>
 Before he went into his grave, in the boundary of the Llan,<br>
 He gave me mead and wine from a crystal cup.</p>
 <p>V. A pleasant Caer there is on the shore of the gulf,<br>
 Pleasantly is given to every one his share.<br>
 I know in Dinbych, white with sea-mews,<br>
 A mild associate, the lord of Erlysan.<br>
 He was my law, on New Year's eve,<br>
 His song (was) solace, the king of splendid war.<br>
 And a veil of green colour, and possessing a feast.<br>
 This may I be, a tongue over the bards of Prydain.</p>
 <p>VI. A pleasant Caer there is, that is supported with gifts,<br>
 Mine were its fords, should I have chosen.<br>
 I will not speak of the progress of the law that I had kept,<br>
 He deserves not a New Year's gift that knows not this.<br>
 The writing of Prydain, anxious care,<br>
 While the waves continue to be agitated about it,<br>
 If necessary, far into a cell I would penetrate.</p>
 <p>VII. A pleasant Caer there is, rising up,<br>
 May we have shares in its meads and praises.<br>
 Pleasant on its boundary the sending forth of its chieftains.<br>
 A cormorant approaches me, long its wings,<br>
 There comes to the top of the scream of the sea-birds.<br>
 Wrath within fate, let it penetrate the sands and stones,<br>
 And the gray wolf the best of conflicts.<br>
 May there be derived from above the banquet accordant reasonings. <a name="page_306"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 306</font></a><br>
 The blessing of the beneficent Ruler of Heaven's harmonious heights (be)<br>
 Upon them; may He make denizens (there) the worthies of Owain.</p>
 <p>VIII. A pleasant Caer there is on the margin of the flood.<br>
 Pleasantly is given to every (one) his desire.<br>
 Address thou Gwyned, be thine the increase.<br>
 The dartings of the terrible spears were poured forth.<br>
 Wednesday, I saw men in distress,<br>
 Thursday, to their disgrace they returned.<br>
 And there were crimsoned hair, and clamorous woe.<br>
 Exhausted were the men of Gwyned the day that they came.<br>
 And on Cevn Llech Vaelwy shields they will break.<br>
 They fell at the Cevn, a host of kinsmen.</p>
