 <p>WHAT man is the porter?<br>
 Glewlwyd Gavaelvawr.<br>
 Who is the man that asks it?<br>
 Arthur and the fair Cai.<br>
 How goes it with thee?<br>
 Truly in the best way in the world.<br>
 Into my house thou shalt not come, <a name="page_262"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 262</font></a><br>
 Unless thou prevailest,<br>
 I forbid it.<br>
 10 Thou shalt see it.<br>
 If Wythnaint were to go,<br>
 The three would be unlucky:--<br>
 Mabon, the, son of Mydron,<br>
 The servant of Uthir Pendragon;<br>
 Cysgaint, the son of Banon;<br>
 And Gwyn Godybrion.<br>
 Terrible were my servants<br>
 Defending their rights.<br>
 Manawydan, the son of Llyr,<br>
 20 Deep was his counsel.<br>
 Did not Manawyd bring<br>
 Perforated shields from Trywruid?<br>
 And Mabon, the son of Mellt,<br>
 Spotted the grass with blood?<br>
 And Anwas Adeiniog,<br>
 And Llwch Llawynnog--<br>
 Guardians were they<br>
 On Eiddyn Cymminog,<br>
 A chieftain that patronised them.<br>
 30 He would have his will and make redress.<br>
 Cai entreated him,<br>
 While he idled every third person.<br>
 When Celli was lost<br>
 Cuelli was found; and rejoiced<br>
 Cai, as long as he hewed down.<br>
 Arthur distributed gifts,<br>
 The blood trickled down.<br>
 In the hall of Awarnach,<br>
 Fighting with a hag,<br>
 40 He cleft the head of Palach.<br>
 In the fastnesses of Dissethach, <a name="page_263"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 263</font></a><br>
 In Mynyd Eiddyn,<br>
 He contended with Cynvyn;<br>
 By the hundred there they fell,<br>
 There they fell by the hundred,<br>
 Before the accomplished Bedwyr.<br>
 On the strands of Trywruid,<br>
 Contending with Garwlwyd,<br>
 Brave was his disposition,<br>
 50 With sword and shield;<br>
 Vanity were the foremost men<br>
 Compared with Cai in the battle.<br>
 The sword in the battle<br>
 Was unerring in his hand.<br>
 They were stanch commanders<br>
 Of a legion for the benefit of the country--<br>
 Bedwyr and Bridlaw;<br>
 Nine hundred would to them listen;<br>
 Six hundred gasping for breath<br>
 60 Would be the cost of attacking them.<br>
 Servants I have had,<br>
 Better it was when they were.<br>
 Before the chiefs of Emrais<br>
 I saw Cai in haste.<br>
 Booty for chieftains<br>
 Was Gwrhir among foes,<br>
 Heavy was his vengeance,<br>
 Severe his advance.<br>
 When he drank from the horn,<br>
 70 He would drink with four.<br>
 To battle when he would come<br>
 By the hundred would he slaughter;<br>
 There was no day that would satisfy him.<br>
 Unmerited was the death of Cai.<br>
 Cai the fair, and Llachau, <a name="page_264"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 264</font></a><br>
 Battles did they sustain,<br>
 Before the pang of blue shafts.<br>
 In the heights of Ystavingon<br>
 Cai pierced nine witches.<br>
 80 Cai the fair went to Mona,<br>
 To devastate Llewon.<br>
 His shield was ready<br>
 Against Cath Palug<br>
 When the people welcomed him.<br>
 Who pierced the Cath Palug?<br>
 Nine score before dawn<br>
 Would fall for its food.<br>
 Nine score chieftains.</p>
