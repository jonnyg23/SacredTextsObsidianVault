 <h3 align="CENTER">BLACK BOOK OF CAERMARTHEN XIII.</h3>
 <p align="CENTER"></p>
 <p>HERE is a graciously disposed King, who is wonderful in the highest degree,<br>
 Who is chief above the children of Adam,<br>
 Who is a happy and most mighty defence,<br>
 Who is generous, glorious, and most pure,<br>
 Whose claim is most strong and binding.<br>
 What is heard of him, and what is true, that will I celebrate.<br>
 To the great God, to the condescending and most compassionate God,<br>
 To the blessed God a sacred song I will sing.<br>
 Until I become a blameless man to God, I will consider the substance,<br>
 10 About the sin which Adam. shined.<br>
 About sin before the judgment I am very anxious,<br>
 Against the day of appointment, when all men shall come<br>
 From their graves in their strength and greatest vigour,<br>
 As they were when they were in their very prime,<br>
 In one host to the one place most pleasant,<br>
 Even to the top of one hill, in order to be judged.<br>
 Among this multitude may I attain the merit<br>
 Of being protected by a retinue of the nine orders of Heaven.<br>
 My God! what a gathering!<br>
 20 My Lord God! may my bardic lore<br>
 Affect the bonds of the universe!<br>
 My great Superior! my Owner!<br>
 The object of my reverence! before going to the sod, before going to the gravel,<br>
 Permit thou me to indite a composition <a name="page_514"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 514</font></a><br>
 To thy praise, before my tongue becomes mute,<br>
 And my memory like Job, who spoke<br>
 Unto his wife concerning her dragonic obedience.<br>
 When the servant of God on a certain day came<br>
 To him to the contest with his wife,<br>
 30 Before the blow he gave a handful<br>
 Of what had peeled from the surface of his flesh.<br>
 And since the presents which any one gave were now acceptable,<br>
 The merciful God made a gift of charity<br>
 In pure gold, the treasure of the Trinity.<br>
 In a fainting state he sits, and there praises God.<br>
 Blessed was he to be plagued! Now said Sin,<br>
 "Thou knowest how to conceal the perfidy of the mysterious Being."<br>
 The love-diffusing Lord of heaven, the Creator, take thou to praise Him,<br>
 That thou mayest reach the fair and happy region,<br>
 40 Happy, pleasant, free, and greatly deserving praise.<br>
 Loving wine, love thou the gentle, preserve the truth.<br>
 Eva did not preserve the sweet apple-tree which God commanded her,<br>
 For her transgression He was not reconciled to her,<br>
 But manifest pain he inflicted upon her.<br>
 Some wonderful covering of a flinty dress she put on herself;<br>
 The Maker of heaven caused her, in the midst of her riches, to make herself bare.<br>
 And a second miracle did the bountiful Lord, who hears being praised.<br>
 When she wished to avoid being caught,<br>
 The way in which she fled was where<br>
 50 There was a ploughman ploughing the ground,<br>
 With men in attendance. The mysterious Trinity has spoken it. <a name="page_515"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 515</font></a><br>
 Then went the faultless mother of splendid gifts<br>
 With her happy husband. A crowd of men<br>
 Afterwards came to ask.<br>
 In an entertainment,<br>
 "Hast thou seen a woman and a son with her?"<br>
 And say thou, for the record's truth,<br>
 And he will not refuse our request,<br>
 That thou didst see us going without her<br>
 60 To a certain spot, and the blessing of God be on it!<br>
 Upon that came a destitute rabble, a race of the disposition of Cain,<br>
 A fierce and iniquitous multitude are they;<br>
 A tower was sought, in order to seek the mysterious Being,<br>
 Then said one who was deformed and unwitty, to the man whom thou seest,--<br>
 "Hast thou seen the men of the city of giants<br>
 Going by thee without turning?"<br>
 I did see them when I harrowed the fair land,<br>
 Where you see the reaping.<br>
 What the children of Cain now did, was<br>
 70 To turn away from the reapers.<br>
 Through the intercession of Mary Maria,<br>
 And her knowledge communicated to her by God,<br>
 There were defending them, besides herself,<br>
 The Holy Spirit and her sanctity.</p>
