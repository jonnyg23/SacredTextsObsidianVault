 <h3 align="CENTER">LXV.</h3>
 <h3 align="CENTER">A FUGITIVE POEM OF MYRDIN IN HIS GRAVE.</h3>
 <h3 align="CENTER">RED BOOK OF HERGEST II.</h3>
 <p align="CENTER"></p>
 <p>THE man that speaks from the grave<br>
 Has been instructed that before seven years,<br>
 The horse of Eurdein of the North will die.</p>
 <p>II. I have quaffed wine from a bright glass<br>
 With the lords of fierce war;<br>
 My name is Myrdin, son of Morvryn.</p>
 <p>III. I have quaffed wine from a goblet<br>
 With the lords of devouring war;<br>
 Myrdin is my deserving name.</p>
 <p>IV. When opposition will come upon a black wheel,<br>
 To destroy Lloegyr of exhausted course,<br>
 Bitter will be their enmity in defending<br>
 The White Mount; at the White Mount distress there will be,<br>
 And long regret to the nation of the Cymry.</p>
 <p>V. There will be no protection in the recesses of Ardudwy,<br>
 In the maritime region of the Cymry,<br>
 From the renowned Boar of the intrepid host.</p>
 <p>VI. When the red one of Normandy will come<br>
 To charge the Lloegrians with enormous expense, <a name="page_479"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 479</font></a><br>
 There will be a tax upon every prediction,<br>
 And a castle at Aber Hodni.</p>
 <p>VII. When the strong-freckled one will come<br>
 As far as Ryd Bengarn,<br>
 Men will be disgraced, hilts worn out:<br>
 The chief noble of Prydein will be their chief in judgment.</p>
 <p>VIII. When Henri will come to claim<br>
 Mur Castell on the border of Eryri,<br>
 Disturbance beyond sea will call him.</p>
 <p>IX. When the pale weak one will come to claim London,<br>
 Upon unhandsome horses,<br>
 He will call forth the lordship of Caergein.</p>
 <p>X. Scarce the acorns, thick the corn,<br>
 When there will suddenly appear<br>
 A king, a youth, woo to such as tremble!</p>
 <p>XI. There will be a youth of great renown,<br>
 Who will conquer a thousand cities;<br>
 Like the life of tender shoots will be that of the king I from a youth.</p>
 <p>XII. Strong towards the weak will he be,<br>
 Weak towards the strong of the uplands;--<br>
 A ruler from whose coming worse it will fare.</p>
 <p>XIII. There will be a state when they will delight in wantonness,<br>
 When women will be a soft herd,<br>
 And a host of young children at confession.</p>
 <p><a name="page_480"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 480</font></a></p>
 <p>XIV. There will be a state when they will delight in order;<br>
 Even the churl will do a good turn;<br>
 The maid will be handsome, and the youth resolute.</p>
 <p>XV. There will be a state towards the end of the age,<br>
 When from adversity the young will fail,<br>
 And in May cuckoos die of cold.</p>
 <p>XVI. There will be a state when they will delight in hunting-dogs,<br>
 And build in intricate places<br>
 And a shirt without great cost cannot be obtained.</p>
 <p>XVII. There will be a state when they will delight in oaths;<br>
 Vice will be active, and churches neglected;<br>
 Words as well as relies will be broken,<br>
 Truth will disappear, and falsehood spread<br>
 Faith will be weak, and disputings on alternate days.</p>
 <p>XVIII. There will be a state when they will delight in clothes;<br>
 The counsellor of a lord will be a vagrant of a bailiff;<br>
 Empty-handed the bard, gay the priest;<br>
 Men will be despised, refusals frequent.</p>
 <p>XIX. There will be a state without wind, without rain,<br>
 Without too much ploughing, without too much consuming,<br>
 Land enough will one acre be for nine.</p>
 <p>XX. When the men will come without manliness,<br>
 And corn grow in the place of trees,<br>
 In peace everywhere feasts will be prevalent.</p>
 <p>XXI. When the cubit shall be held in esteem, trees in spring<br>
 There will be after the chief of mischief:<br>
 Let the cowhouse post be worse than a coulter.</p>
 <p><a name="page_481"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 481</font></a></p>
 <p>XXII. Wednesday, a day of enmity,<br>
 Blades will be completely worn out;<br>
 They will conceal two in the blood of Cynghen.</p>
 <p>XXIII. In Aber Sor there will be a council,<br>
 On men after the devastation of battle,<br>
 A happy ruler is a leader in the camp.</p>
 <p>XXIV. In Aber Avon will be the host of Mona,<br>
 And Angles after that will be at Hinwedon;<br>
 His valour will Moryon long preserve.</p>
 <p>XXV. In Aber Dwvyr the leader will not hold out,<br>
 When that which will be performed by Gwidig will take place,<br>
 And after the battle of Cyvarllug.</p>
 <p>XXVI. A battle will be on the river Byrri,<br>
 And the Brython will be victorious;<br>
 The men of Gwhyr will perform acts of heroism.</p>
 <p>XXVII. In Aber Don a battle will ensue,<br>
 And the shafts will be unequal,<br>
 And crimson blood on the brow of Saxons.<br>
 Servile is thy cry, thou Gwendydd!<br>
 Have told it me the ghosts<br>
 Of the mountain, in Aber Carav.</p>
