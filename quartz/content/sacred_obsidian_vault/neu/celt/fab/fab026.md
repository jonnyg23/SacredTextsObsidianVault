 <p>GOD preserve the heavens<br>
 From a flood wide spreading.<br>
 The first surging billow<br>
 Has rolled over the sea-beach.<br>
 What tree is greater<br>
 Than he, Daronwy?<br>
 I know not for a refuge<br>
 Around the proud circle of heaven,<br>
 That there is a mystery which is greater.<br>
 10 The light of the men of Goronwy.<br>
 Perhaps it may be known,<br>
 The magic wand of Mathonwy,<br>
 In the wood when it grows.<br>
 Fruits more profitable,<br>
 On the bank of Gwyllyonwy.<br>
 Cynan shall obtain it,<br>
 At the time when he governs.<br>
 There will come yet<br>
 Over the ebb and over the strand,<br>
 20 Four chief sovereignties,<br>
 And the fifth not worse.<br>
 Men vehement, extensive. <a name="page_270"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 270</font></a><br>
 Over Prydain (their) purpose.<br>
 Women shall be eloquent,<br>
 Strangers shall be captive,<br>
 A torrent of longing<br>
 For mead and horsemanship.<br>
 There will come two ladies,<br>
 A widow, and a slender single one;<br>
 30 Iron their wings,<br>
 On warriors brooding.<br>
 Chieftains will come,<br>
 From about the land of Rome.<br>
 Their song will harmonise,<br>
 Their praise will spread abroad.<br>
 The nature of the oak and thorns<br>
 In song will harmonise.<br>
 A dog to draw,<br>
 A horse to move.<br>
 40 An ox to gore; a sow to turn up.<br>
 The fifth fair young beast Jesus made<br>
 From the apparel of Adam to proceed.<br>
 The foliage of trees, fair to behold them,<br>
 Whilst they were, and whilst it was.<br>
 When the Cymry shall commit transgressions,<br>
 A foreigner will be found, who will love what was?<br>
 I have leaped a leap from a clear leap,<br>
 Good has been dispersed abroad, if a person finds no evil.<br>
 The funeral-pile of Run, it is an expiation,<br>
 50 Between Caer Rian and Caer Rywg,<br>
 Between Dineiddyn and Dineiddwg<br>
 A clear glance and a watchful sight.<br>
 From the agitation of fire smoke will be raised,<br>
 And God our Creator will defend us.</p>
