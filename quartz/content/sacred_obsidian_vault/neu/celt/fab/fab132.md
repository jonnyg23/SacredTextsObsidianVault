 <h3 align="CENTER">CXVII.</h3>
 <h3 align="CENTER">THE VIATICUM OF LLEVOED WYNEBGLAWR.</h3>
 <h3 align="CENTER">RED BOOK OF HERGEST XXIV.</h3>
 <p align="CENTER"></p>
 <p>I. THE wealth of the world, let it go, it will come,<br>
 As long as it is esteemed.<br>
 Necessity equalises affliction,<br>
 There will be fair weather after rain.<br>
 It is often the case that persons fostered by the same are unlike.<br>
 The brave will play though blood way be shed.<br>
 Every coward will be trampled upon;<br>
 Every strong one will be allowed to pass.<br>
 The happy is pleased with harmonious sounds,<br>
 Which God will freely pour upon him.</p>
 <p>II. The wealth of the world, let it go, it will come;<br>
 May God provide what suffices!<br>
 Loud is the noise of the wave against the land;<br>
 When called, it recedeth from it.<br>
 Listless is the man that sees not,<br>
 That is not concerned, that cares not what may be.<br>
 Where justice is not practised, it is not entertained in the country.<br>
 Mass will not be sting on a flight.<br>
 Let him be a wolf that dareth deceive.<br>
 Desirous will the scholar be that Llawddino should prosper.</p>
 <p><a name="page_597"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 597</font></a></p>
 <p>III. The wealth of the world, let it go, it will come.<br>
 Desire calls for the return of liberty.<br>
 The height of the young will increase.<br>
 Lying praise will not be borrowed.<br>
 The slave and the free are not of the same design.<br>
 Empty the country, where there is no religion.<br>
 There will be a return which will not be repeated.<br>
 Cold does not agree with the hoary.<br>
 The unbeliever does not think of God.<br>
 No one that does not improve is called skilful.<br>
 Let us observe and acquire religion,<br>
 Until we have relationship with Christ.</p>
 <p>IV. The unsociable man is uncomely in the place of gathering.<br>
 Trouble in the upland, enmity in the vale.<br>
 A refusal is better than a false promise.<br>
 In one's actions servility is supererogatory.<br>
 The sweet is seldom unpleasant.<br>
 The evil done by a fellow will survive after he has passed away.<br>
 An excuse is not usually regarded.<br>
 Good cannot be had without deserts.<br>
 The four quarters open deeply in four different ways.<br>
 It is a saying that death is better than trouble.<br>
 Bad is sin from its being far pursued.<br>
 It is good in distress to support a monastery.<br>
 God of Heaven! woe to the daring one that does not believe thee!<br>
 Son of Mary! endowed with undefiled genius,<br>
 It is a good work to hope in thee;<br>
 Before the world thou art mentioned.</p>
 <p>V. The wave hastens forward; let it beat the shore.<br>
 The fuel of wrath is impulsive. <a name="page_598"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 598</font></a><br>
 Watch-stones form the best history.<br>
 The wisdom of a host, and deception through laughter.<br>
 Let fundamental knowledge be accurate.<br>
 Let the weakling be slow; let the niggard die.<br>
 The evil alliance of Gall Cynnin.<br>
 With a wanton a secret will not long remain.<br>
 Blood will cause blood to flow,<br>
 The froward will meet with contention.<br>
 Let the weak be set at large.<br>
 The iniquitous will lose his clan.<br>
 Except God, there is no one that knows the future.<br>
 Its lord is the chief cause of prosperity to a country.</p>
 <p>VI. The wave hastens forward; the beach repels.<br>
 Light pain will soon be relieved;<br>
 The multitude will bustle about the mead-liquor.<br>
 Let him who ejects every one from his frontier cease to exist.<br>
 Let the obstinate be cut off.<br>
 Whoso purchases heaven will not be confounded.<br>
 How curious thou art that any should mention it.<br>
 The trees have put on a beauteous robe.<br>
 A mirror is not visible in the dark.<br>
 A candle will not preserve from cold.<br>
 He is not happy who is not discreet.<br>
 The favour of the Supreme Being will not deceive.</p>
 <p>VII. He who cultivates not wisdom as the chief foundation,<br>
 What will put a bird to flight he will not do.<br>
 Cold is the sway of winter; bare the sea-shore.<br>
 Better is what is easy than the encountering of difficulties.<br>
 Reproach will not mend what is evil.<br>
 Many a boastful word will cause embarrassment.<br>
 To the bosom, while it goes about; <a name="page_599"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 599</font></a><br>
 From haste it cannot be known where it will go.<br>
 The Trinity will retaliate arrogance.<br>
 Great God! how good a Being thou art!</p>
 <p>VIII. Fleet is the steed; clear is every strand;<br>
 The desire of the high-minded one is chivalry.<br>
 No one reaps from his contrivance.<br>
 Every one is not born wise.<br>
 The mind is not bold in a ship on the strand.<br>
 There will be no peace between dry sticks and the flame.<br>
 Let a man live without evil conduct,<br>
 Courteous to song, I confer benefits on those in a state of excommunication.<br>
 No naked one will be very energetic.<br>
 There is no law unless there be supremacy.<br>
 A king will challenge spoil.<br>
 The furious, his death is certain.<br>
 Is it not customary that cowardice should harbour from death.<br>
 Let the brave escape from his conflict.<br>
 Intoxicated the dumb; every barbarian is a bravado.<br>
 A city will extinguish a wilderness.<br>
 The talkative loves easy work.<br>
 Every one is praised according to his work.<br>
 God loves not the hopeless.<br>
 Fortune is the best assistance.</p>
 <p>IX. In spring the land is partly bare,<br>
 If people are turbulent, their shout is deceitful.<br>
 In calm reflection riches are despised.<br>
 What is not often seen is neglected.<br>
 He that is faithless, his presumption will be contemned.<br>
 It is a complete share that is longed for.<br>
 Let the woman that is never asked appear demure. <a name="page_600"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 600</font></a><br>
 Disgrace is apt to follow long celibacy.<br>
 He that will not completely conceal himself, will be completely taken away.<br>
 From a long restraint comes complaint.<br>
 What seemeth good to God is certain.<br>
 He that is brave, his praise will be heard abroad.<br>
 From a little comes enrichment.<br>
 Blessed is he to whom are given<br>
 The favour of God and long life.</p>
