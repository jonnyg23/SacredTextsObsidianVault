 <p align="CENTER"></p>
 <p>IN the name of the God of Trinity, of knowing charity,<br>
 A tribe numerous, ungentle their arrogance,<br>
 Have overrun Prydain, chief of isles.<br>
 Men of the land of Asia, and land of Gafis.<br>
 A people of perfect prudence, their country is not known,<br>
 Their mother country; they deviated on account of the sea.<br>
 Flowing their coats; who is like them?<br>
 With discretion let the work of foes be brought about,<br>
 Europin, Arafin, Arafanis.<br>
 10 The Christian unmindful was impelled certainly<br>
 Before the reconciliation of Llud and Llevelys..<br>
 The possessor of the fair isle trembled<br>
 Before the chief from Rome, of splendid terror.<br>
 Neither hesitating nor crafty the king, fluent his speech.<br>
 Who has seen what I have seen of the strange speech?<br>
 There were formed a square mast, the clarions of journey,<br>
 Before the presence of Roman leader there is conflagration. <a name="page_254"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 254</font></a><br>
 The son of Gradd, of fluent speech, retaliated,<br>
 Cymry burning: war on slaves.<br>
 20 I will consider, I will deliberate who caused them to go.<br>
 The Brythonic energy arose.</p>
