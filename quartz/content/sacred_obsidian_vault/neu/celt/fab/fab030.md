 <h3 align="CENTER">BOOK OF TALIESSIN I.</h3>

 <h3 align="CENTER">RED BOOK OF HERGEST XXIII.</h3>
 <p align="CENTER"></p>
 <p>PRIMITIVE and ingenious address, when thoroughly elucidated.<br>
 Which was first, is it darkness, is it light?<br>
 Or Adam, when he existed, on what day was he created?<br>
 Or under the earth's surface, what the foundation?<br>
 He who is a legionary will receive no instruction.<br>
 Est qui peccator in many things,<br>
 Will lose the heavenly country, the community of priests.<br>
 In the morning no one comes<br>
 If they sing of three spheres.<br>
 10 Angles and Gallwydel,<br>
 Let them make their way.<br>
 Whence come night and day?<br>
 Whence will the eagle become gray?<br>
 Whence is it that night is dark?<br>
 Whence is it that the linnet is green?<br>
 The ebullition of the sea, <a name="page_285"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 285</font></a><br>
 How is it not seen?<br>
 There are three fountains<br>
 In the mountain of roses,<br>
 20 There is a Caer of defence<br>
 Under the ocean's wave.<br>
 Illusive greeter,<br>
 What is the porter's name?<br>
 Who was confessor<br>
 To the gracious Son of Mary?<br>
 What was the most beneficial measure<br>
 Which Adam accomplished?<br>
 Who will measure Uffern?<br>
 How thick its veil?<br>
 30 How wide its mouth?<br>
 What the size of its stones?<br>
 Or the tops of its whirling trees?<br>
 Who bends them so crooked?<br>
 Or what fumes may be<br>
 About their stems?<br>
 Is it Lleu and Gwydyon<br>
 That perform their arts?<br>
 Or do they know books<br>
 When they do?<br>
 40 Whence come night and flood?<br>
 How they disappear?<br>
 Whither flies night from day;<br>
 And how is it not seen?<br>
 Pater noster ambulo<br>
 Gentis tonans in adjuvando<br>
 Sibilem signum<br>
 Rogantes fortium.<br>
 Excellent in every way around the glens<br>
 The two skilful ones make inquiries<br>
 50 About Caer Cerindan Cerindydd <a name="page_286"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 286</font></a><br>
 For the draught-horses of pector David.<br>
 They have enjoyment--they move about--<br>
 May they find me greatly expanding.<br>
 The Cymry will be lamenting<br>
 While their souls will be tried<br>
 Before a horde of ravagers.<br>
 The Cymry, chief wicked ones,<br>
 On account of the loss of holy wafers.<br>
 There will long be crying and wailing,<br>
 60 And gore will be conspicuous.<br>
 There came by sea<br>
 The wood-steeds of the strand.<br>
 The Angles in council<br>
 Shall see signs of<br>
 Exultation over Saxons.<br>
 The praises of the rulers<br>
 Will be celebrated in Sion.<br>
 Let the chief builders be<br>
 Against the fierce Ffichti,<br>
 70 The Morini Brython.<br>
 Their fate has been predicted;<br>
 And the reaping of heroes<br>
 About the river Severn.<br>
 The stealing is disguised of Ken and Masswy<br>
 Ffis amala, ffur, ffir, sel,<br>
 Thou wilt discern the Trinity beyond my age<br>
 I implore the Creator, hai<br>
 Huai, that the Gentile may vanish<br>
 From the Gospel. Equally worthy<br>
 80 With the retinue of the wall<br>
 Cornu ameni dur.<br>
 I have been with skilful men,<br>
 With Matheu and Govannon,<br>
 With Eunydd and Elestron, <a name="page_287"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 287</font></a><br>
 In company with Achwyson,<br>
 For a year in Caer Gofannon.<br>
 I am old. I am young. I am Gwion,<br>
 I am universal, I am possessed of penetrating wit.<br>
 Thou wilt remember thy old Brython<br>
 90 (And) the Gwyddyl, kiln distillers,<br>
 Intoxicating the drunkards.<br>
 I am a bard; I will not disclose secrets to slaves;<br>
 I am a guide: I am expert in contests.<br>
 If he would sow, he would plough; he would plough, he would not reap.<br>
 If a brother among brothers,<br>
 Didactic Bards with swelling breasts will arise<br>
 Who will meet around mead-vessels,<br>
 And sing wrong poetry<br>
 And seek rewards that will not be,<br>
 100 Without law, without regulation, without gifts.<br>
 And afterwards will become angry.<br>
 There will be commotions and turbulent times,<br>
 Seek no peace--it will not accrue to thee.<br>
 The Ruler of Heaven knows thy prayer.<br>
 From his ardent wrath thy praise has propitiated hint<br>
 The Sovereign King of Glory addresses me with wisdom:--<br>
 Hast thou seen the dominus fortis?<br>
 Knowest thou the profound prediction domini?<br>
 To the advantage of Uffern<br>
 110 Hic nemo in por progenie<br>
 He has liberated its tumultuous multitude.<br>
 Dominus virtutum<br>
 Has gathered together those that were in slavery,<br>
 And before I existed He had perceived me.<br>
 May I be ardently devoted to God!<br>
 And before I desire the end of existence, <a name="page_288"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 288</font></a><br>
 And before the broken foam shall come upon my lips,<br>
 And before I become connected with wooden boards,<br>
 May there be festivals to my soul!<br>
 120 Book-learning scarcely tells me<br>
 Of severe afflictions after death-bed<br>
 And such as have heard my bardic books<br>
 They shall obtain the region of heaven, the best of all abodes.</p>
