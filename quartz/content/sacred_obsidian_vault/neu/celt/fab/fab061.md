 <h2 align="CENTER">POEMS RELATING TO URIEN AND HIS SON OWEN.</h2>
 <h3 align="CENTER">XLVI.</h3>
 <h3 align="CENTER">BOOK OF TALIESSIN XVIII.</h3>
 <p align="CENTER"></p>
 <p>A rumour has come to met from Calchvynyd,<br>
 A disgrace in the south country, a praiseworthy pillage.<br>
 And he will give to a lion the fierceness of his baptism.<br>
 Full is his strath of joyful produce.<br>
 The people are satiated with warfare, the strangers are satiated,<br>
 A battle of encroachment, during the excessive heat of the country,<br>
 A wonder of Cymry that relate it.<br>
 Let the cattle of the son of Idno come to Dyved.<br>
 And let no one dare not to come.<br>
 10 To pay a hundred cows I will give one calf.<br>
 The slaughter of thy foes about thy country,<br>
 Like fire it heats a vapour where it happens to be.<br>
 When we made an expedition to the land of Gwydno,<br>
 There was a corpse delicately fair between the gravel and the pebbles on the bank.<br>
 When he returned in the autumn from the country of Clydesmen,<br>
 The cow did not low to her calf.<br>
 Will greet Mabon from another country,<br>
 A battle, when Owain defends the cattle of his country.<br>
 A battle in the ford of Alclud, a battle in the Gwen, <a name="page_364"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 364</font></a><br>
 20 A battle, in conjunction of tumult to them.<br>
 A battle against Rodawys of snowy-white aspect,<br>
 Brandishing of spears and black, and bright sheets,<br>
 A battle on this side of the gleaming guiding heart of oak.<br>
 A shield in hand, the camp trembling,<br>
 Saw Mabon on the fair portion of Reidol.<br>
 Against the kine of Reged they engaged,<br>
 If they had wings they would have flown.<br>
 Against Mabon without corpses they would not go.<br>
 Meeting, they descend and commence the battle.<br>
 30 The country of Mabon is pierced with destructive slaughter.<br>
 When Owain descends for the kine of his father,<br>
 There broke out lime, and wax, and hawthorn.<br>
 Is it not fair prey for any one to take a bald cow?<br>
 Support each other against men with ruddy spears.<br>
 Against the four-way-spreading conflagration,<br>
 Against the mighty rising.<br>
 Against gore on flesh,<br>
 Against a dismal straining.<br>
 A rumour came to me,<br>
 40 From the bright lands of the South.<br>
 Splendid and liberal chiefs declare<br>
 That thou shalt not be addressed by vulgar ones.<br>
 About the ford of the boundary, about the alders his battle-places.<br>
 When was caused the battle of the king, sovereign, prince,<br>
 Very wild will the kine be before Mabon.<br>
 From the meeting of Gwrgun.<br>
 The resting-place of the corpses of some was in Run.<br>
 There was joy, there will be for ravens.<br>
 Loud the talk of men after<br>
 50 Battle. Escaped not the shield of Owain.<br>
 With notched shield an opposing in battle tumult, <a name="page_365"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 365</font></a><br>
 Cattle would not run about without crimson faces.<br>
 Crimson were the kine of Bender, and great his grace,<br>
 Gore surrounding the top of his head.<br>
 And a white face conspicuous the gasping.<br>
 The golden saddle (was) drenched in gore, as to its appearance.<br>
 The Gwentians praise the booty, the booty was extended,<br>
 The booty in front of the eager battle of the eager strangers.<br>
 A booty of heads with forked branches. On the shields<br>
 60 Awfully the blades are falling about the head.<br>
 A battle in front of Owain, great, great his rage.<br>
 A fine day, they fell, men, defending (their) country.<br>
 There rested the extreme-impelling advantage of their father.</p>
