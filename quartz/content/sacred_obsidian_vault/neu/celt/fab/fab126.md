 When they grow in the upper part of the dingle;<br>
 The languid heart, longing is her complaint.</p>

 Every ingenious person will be honoured.<br>
 It is the duty of the fair one to afford sleep to him in pain.</p>

 In the lake; the wind whistles over the tops of the branches;<br>

 In the wise; and to the unwise be repulsive;<br>

 Sweet the cow-parsnip, the wave keeps laughing;<br>

 Let every one preserve his purity of life.<br>
 The greatest blemish is ill-manners.</p>

 Every prudent one, a chider of another;<br>
 And after loving, indiscretion leaving it.</p>

 Unafflicted will be every squabby one;<br>

 Running are my tears this day;<br>

 The charlock; how reproachless are the blind;<br>
 How apt to run about are youngsters!</p>

 Is the aged one, and bees to the wilds<br>
 Except God, there is no avenger.</p>

 The bees are high; brittle the dry brushwood;<br>

 And the oak-leaves are falling;<br>
 Happy is he who sees the one he loves.</p>

 When spread under the pillow;<br>

 Trees are fair ornaments for the ground;<br>

 <p>XXIX. Bright is the top of the bush; valuable the steed;<br>
 It is good to have discretion with strength;<br>
 Let the unskilful be made powerless.</p>
 <p>XXX. Bright are the tops of the brakes; gay the plumage<br>
 Of birds; the long day is the gift of the light;<br>
 Mercifully has the most beneficent God made them.</p>
 <p><a name="page_580"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 580</font></a></p>

 In the grove; bold the wind, the trees shake;<br>
 Interceding with the obdurate will not avail.</p>

 Accustomed is the violent to oppress;<br>
 Woe to him who takes a reward from the hand.</p>
