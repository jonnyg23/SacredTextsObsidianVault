 <p align="CENTER"></p>
 <p>O little pig! thou happy little pig!<br>
 Bury not thy snout on the top of the mountain;<br>
 Burrow in a secluded place in the woods,<br>
 For fear of the hunting dogs of Rydderch, the champion of the faith. <a name="page_483"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 483</font></a><br>
 And I will prognosticate, and it will be true,<br>
 As far as Aber Taradyr, before the usurpers of Prydein,<br>
 All the Cymry will be under the same warlike leader;<br>
 His name is Llywelyn, of the line<br>
 Of Gwynedd, one who will overcome.</p>
 <p>II. Listen, O little pig! it is necessary to go,<br>
 For fear of the hunters of Mordei, if one dared,<br>
 Lest we be pursued and discovered;<br>
 And should we escape, I shall not complain of fatigue,<br>
 And. I will predict, in respect of the ninth wave,<br>
 And in respect of the single white-bearded person, who exhausted Dyved,<br>
 Who erected a chancel in the land for those of partial belief,<br>
 In the upland region, and among wild beasts.<br>
 Until Cynan comes to it, to see its distress,<br>
 Her habitations will never be restored.</p>
 <p>III. Listen, O little pig! I cannot easily sleep,<br>
 On account of the tumult of grief which is upon me;<br>
 Ten years and forty have I endured pain;<br>
 Evil is the joy which I now have.<br>
 May life be given me by Jesus, the most trustworthy<br>
 Of the kings of heaven, of highest lineage!<br>
 It will not be well with the female descendants of Adam,<br>
 If they believe not in God, in the latter day.<br>
 I have seen Gwenddoleu, with the precious gifts of princes,<br>
 Gathering prey from every extremity of the land;<br>
 Beneath my green sod is he not still!<br>
 The chief of sovereigns of the North, of mildest disposition.</p>
 <p>IV. Listen, O little pig! it was necessary to pray,<br>
 For fear of the five sovereigns from Normandi;<br>
 And the fifth going over the salt sea, <a name="page_484"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 484</font></a><br>
 To conquer Iwerdon with its pleasant towns;<br>
 He will cause war and confusion,<br>
 And ruddy arms and groanings in it.<br>
 And they, certainly, will come from it,<br>
 And do honour on the grave of Dewi.<br>
 And I will predict that there will be confusion<br>
 From the fighting of son and father, the country shall know it;<br>
 And that there will be to the Lloegrians the falling of cities,<br>
 And that deliverance will never be to Normandi.</p>
 <p>V. Listen, O little pig! be not drowsy;<br>
 There comes to us a sad report<br>
 Of petty chieftains full of perjury<br>
 And husbandmen. that are close-fisted of the penny.<br>
 When there shall come over the sea men completely covered with armour,<br>
 With war-horses under them, having two faces,<br>
 And two points on their terribly destructive spears;<br>
 There will be ploughing without reaping in the world of war;<br>
 The grave will be better than life to all the wretched;<br>
 Horns will be on the women of the four quarters;<br>
 When the vigorous young men shall become corpses,<br>
 There will be a severe morning in Caer Sallawg.</p>
 <p>VI. Listen, O little pig! thou pig of peace!<br>
 A Sibyl has told me a wonderful tale;<br>
 And I will predict a summer full of fury,<br>
 Between brothers, treachery from Gwynedd.<br>
 When a pledge of peace shall long be required from the land of Gwynedd,<br>
 There shall come seven hundred ships of the Gynt with the north wind;<br>
 And in Aber Dau their conference will be.</p>
 <p><a name="page_435"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 435</font></a></p>
 <p>VII. Listen, O little pig! thou blessed little pig!<br>
 A Sibyl has told me it tale which frightens me;<br>
 When Lloegyr shall encamp in the land of Ethlin,<br>
 And make Dyganwy a strong fort,<br>
 By the . . . of Lloegyr and Llywelyn,<br>
 There will be it child on the shoulders . . . baggage.<br>
 When Deinoel, the son of Dunawd Deinwyn, becomes enraged,<br>
 The Frank shall flee the way he does not seek;<br>
 In Aber Dulas their support will be exhausted,<br>
 Of a ruddy hue will be their garments around them.</p>
 <p>VIII. Listen, O little pig! listen to the calls for attention!<br>
 For the crime of the necessitous God will make remissions.<br>
 . . . what is becoming, be it mine,<br>
 And what is . . . let him seek.</p>
 <p>IX. Listen, O little pig! it is broad daylight,<br>
 Hark thou to the song of water-birds whose notes are loud!<br>
 To us there will be years and long days,<br>
 And iniquitous rulers, and the blasting of fruit,<br>
 And bishops sheltering thieves, churches desecrated,<br>
 And monks who will compensate for loads of sins.</p>
 <p>X. Listen, O little pig! penetrate into Gwynedd;<br>
 Have a partner when thou goest to rest.<br>
 Little does Rydderch Hael know to-night at his feast<br>
 What sleeplessness last night I bore.<br>
 The snow was up to my knee, owing to the wariness of the chief,<br>
 Icicles hung to my hair; sad is my fate! <a name="page_486"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 486</font></a><br>
 Tuesday will come, the day of fierce anger,<br>
 Between the ruler of Powys, and the region of Gwynedd.<br>
 When the beam of light will arise from its long repose,<br>
 And defend from its enemy the frontiers of Gwynedd.<br>
 Unless my Maker will grant me a share of his mercy,<br>
 Woe to me that I have existed, miserable will be my end!</p>
 <p>XI. Listen, O little pig! utter not a whisper,<br>
 When the host of war marches from Caermarthen,<br>
 To support, in the common cause, two whelps<br>
 Of the line of Rys, the stay of battle, the warlike commander of armies,<br>
 When the Saxon shall be slain in the conflict of Cymmerau,<br>
 Blessed will be the lot of Cymry, the people of Cymrwy.</p>
 <p>XII. Listen, O little pig! blessed little pig of the country!<br>
 Do not sleep in the morning, burrow not in the fertile region,<br>
 Lest Rydderch Hael and his cunning dogs should come,<br>
 And before thou couldst reach the wood, thy perspiration trickled down.</p>
 <p>XIII. Listen, O little pig! thou blessed pig!<br>
 Hadst thou seen as much severe oppression as I have,<br>
 Thou wouldst not sleep in the morning, nor burrow on the hill.<br>
 When the Saxons repose from their serpent cunning,<br>
 And the castle of Collwyn is resorted to from afar,<br>
 Clothes will be smart, and the black pool clear.</p>
 <p>XIV. Listen, O little pig! hear thou now;<br>
 When the men of Gwynedd lay down their great work,<br>
 Blades will be in hands, horns will be sounded, <a name="page_487"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 487</font></a><br>
 Armour will be broken before sharp lances.<br>
 And I will predict that two rightful princes<br>
 Will produce peace from heaven to earth--<br>
 Cynan, Cadwaladyr, thorough Cymry.<br>
 May their councils be admired.<br>
 The laws of the country, and the exclusion of troubles,<br>
 And the abolition of armies and theft;<br>
 And to us then there shall be a relief after our ills,<br>
 And from generosity none will be excluded.</p>
 <p>XV. Listen, Q little pig! is not the mountain green?<br>
 My cloak is thin for me there is no repose;<br>
 Pale is my visage, Gwendydd does not come to me.<br>
 When the men of Bryneich will bring their army to the shore,<br>
 Cymry will conquer, glorious will be their day.</p>
 <p>XVI. Listen, O little pig! thou brawny pig!<br>
 Bury not thy snout, consume not Mynwy;<br>
 Love no pledge, love no play.<br>
 And an advice I will give to Gwenabwy,<br>
 "Be not an amorous youth given to wanton play."<br>
 And I will predict the battle of Machawy,<br>
 When there will be ruddy spears. in the Riw Dydmwy,<br>
 From the contention of chieftains; breast will heave on the saddles;<br>
 There will be a morning of woe, and a woeful visitation;<br>
 A bear from Deheubarth will arise,<br>
 His men will spread over the land of Mynwy.<br>
 Blessed is the lot that awaits Gwendydd,<br>
 When the Prince of Dyved comes to rule,</p>
 <p>XVII. Listen, O little pig! are not the buds of thorns<br>
 Very green, the mountain beautiful, and beautiful the earth? <a name="page_488"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 488</font></a><br>
 And I will predict the battle of Coed Llwyvein,<br>
 And ruddy biers from the attack of Owein,<br>
 When stewards shall make short disputes,<br>
 When there will be perjury and treachery amongst the children of the land;<br>
 And When Cadwaladyr comes to conquer<br>
 Mona, the Saxons shall be extirpated from lovely Prydein.</p>
 <p>XVIII. Listen, O little pig! great wonders<br>
 Will be in Prydein, and I shall not be concerned;<br>
 When come the inhabitants of the regions about<br>
 Mona to question the Brython, there will be troublesome times;<br>
 A successful leader will uplift radiant spears,<br>
 Stout Cynan, appearing from the banks of the Teiwi,<br>
 Will cause confusion in Dyved;<br>
 May there be to him for riches melody in it!</p>
 <p>XIX. Listen, O little pig! how wonderful it is<br>
 That the world is never long in the same condition!<br>
 How far the Saxons proclaim the cause of strife<br>
 With the generous Brython, the sons of trouble!<br>
 And I will predict before the end<br>
 The Brython uppermost of the Saxons; the Picts say it;<br>
 And then will come upon its the spirit of joyfulness,<br>
 After having long been of a tardy disposition.</p>
 <p>XX. Listen, O little pig! hear thou the melody<br>
 And chirping of birds by Caer Reon.<br>
 One I have that I would place on Mynydd Maon,<br>
 To view the comely forms of the lovely ones.<br>
 And I will predict a battle on the wave,<br>
 And the battle of Machawy, and a battle on a river, <a name="page_489"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 489</font></a><br>
 Ant] the battle of Cors Vochno, and the battle of Minron,<br>
 And the battle of Cymminawd, and the battle of Caerlleon,<br>
 And the battle of Abergwaith, and the battle of Ieithion;<br>
 And when there shall be an end of music at the land's end;<br>
 A child will arise, and good there will be to the Brython.</p>
 <p>XXI. Listen, O little pig! a period will come,<br>
 How miserable that it should come, but come it will!<br>
 Maids will be bold, and wives wanton;<br>
 They will love, but will not revere their kindred;<br>
 Liberal will not the prosperous be towards one another.<br>
 Bishops will be of a different language, worthless, and faithless.</p>
 <p>XXII. Listen, O little pig! thou little speckled one!<br>
 List to the voice of sea-birds, great is their energy!<br>
 Minstrels will be out, without their appropriate portion;<br>
 Though they stand at the door, a reward will not come,<br>
 I was told by a sea-gull that had come from afar,<br>
 That strange sovereigns will make their appearance;<br>
 Gwyddyl, and Brython, and Romani<br>
 Will create discord and confusion,<br>
 And in the name of gods will come into it,<br>
 And vigorously fight on both banks of the Tywi.</p>
 <p>XXIII. Listen, O little pig! thou stout-armed little one!<br>
 Hark to the voice of sea-birds, whose clamour is great.<br>
 Minstrels will be out, without an honourable portion,<br>
 There will be repugnance to hospitality; a youth will have his own opinion,<br>
 Without protection of countenance, without an honourable portion. <a name="page_490"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 490</font></a><br>
 When two brothers will be two Idases for land,<br>
 From their claim will be cherished a lasting feud.</p>
 <p>XXIV. Listen, O little pig! to me it is of no purpose<br>
 To hear the voice of water-birds, whose scream is tumultuous,<br>
 Thin is the hair of my head, my covering is not warm;<br>
 The dales are my barn, my corn is not plenteous;<br>
 My summer collection affords me no relief,<br>
 Before parting from God, incessant was my passion.<br>
 And I will predict, before the end of the world,<br>
 Women without shame, and men without manliness.</p>
 <p>XXV. Listen, O little pig! a trembling pig!<br>
 Thin is my covering, for me there is no repose,<br>
 Since the battle of Ardeleryd it will not concern me,<br>
 Though the sky were to fall, and sea to overflow.<br>
 And I will predict that after Henri<br>
 Such and such a king in troublesome times.<br>
 When there shall be a bridge on the Taw, and another on the Tywi,<br>
 There will be an end of war in it.</p>
