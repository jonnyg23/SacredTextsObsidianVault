 <h3 align="CENTER">XXXI.</h3>
 <h3 align="CENTER">BLACK BOOK OF CAERMARTHEN XXX.</h3>
 <p align="CENTER"></p>
 <p>I. KEEN is the gale, bare the hill,<br>
 It is difficult to find a shelter;<br>
 The ford is turbid, frozen is the lake,<br>
 A man stands firm with one stalk.</p>
 <p>II. Wave after wave rolls towards the shore;<br>
 Loud the shoutings in front of the heights of the hill,<br>
 If one but just stands out.</p>
 <p>III. Cold is the place of the lake-before the winter storm;<br>
 Dry the stalks of broken reeds;<br>
 Lucky is he who sees the wood in the chest.</p>
 <p>IV. Cold is the bed of fish in the shelter of a sheet of ice;<br>
 Lean the stag; the topmost reeds move quickly;<br>
 Short the evening; bent the trees.</p>
 <p>V. Let the white snow fall in deposits;<br>
 Warriors will not leave their duty;<br>
 Cold are the lakes without the appearance of warmth.</p>
 <p>VI. Let the white snow fall on the boar frost;<br>
 Idle is the shield on the shoulder of the aged;<br>
 The wind is very high; it has certainly frozen.</p>
 <p>VII. Let the snow fall on the surface of the ice;<br>
 Gently sweeps the wind the tops of thick trees;<br>
 Firm is the shield on the shoulder of the brave.</p>
 <p><a name="page_322"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 322</font></a></p>
 <p>VIII. Let the snow descend and cover the vale<br>
 Warriors will hasten to battle;<br>
 I shall not go;--infirmity will not let me!</p>
 <p>IX. Let the snow fall from the side of the slope<br>
 Prisoner is the steed, lean the cattle<br>
 Cold is no pleasure to-day.</p>
 <p>X. Let the snow fall; white is the mountain-region;<br>
 Bare the timber of the ship on sea;<br>
 A host of men will cherish many counsels.</p>
 <p>XI. Golden hands are around the horns, the horns in agitation;<br>
 Cold the stream, bright the sky,<br>
 Short the evening, bending are the tops of trees.</p>
 <p>XII. The bees (live) on their store; small the clamour of birds,<br>
 The day is dewless;<br>
 The hill-top is a conspicuous object; red the dawn.</p>
 <p>XIII. The bees are under cover; cold also is the ford,<br>
 Let the frost freeze as long as it lasts:<br>
 To him that is soft may dissolution happen!</p>
 <p>XIV. The bees are in confinement this very day;<br>
 How withered the stalks, hard the slope;<br>
 Cold and dewless is the earth to-day.</p>
 <p>XV. The bees are in shelter from the wet of winter;<br>
 Blue the mist, hollow the cow-parsnip;<br>
 Cowardliness is a bad quality in a man.</p>
 <p><a name="page_323"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 323</font></a></p>
 <p>XVI. Long the night, bare the moor, hoary the cliff;<br>
 Gray the fair gull on the precipice;<br>
 Rough the seas; there will be rain to-day.</p>
 <p>XVII. Dry the wind, wet the road,<br>
 The vale assumes its former appearance.</p>
 <p>XVIII. Cold the thistle-stalks; lean the stag;<br>
 Smooth the river; there will be fine weather.</p>
 <p>XIX. Foul the weather on the mountain; the rivers troubled;<br>
 Flood will wet the ground in towns;<br>
 The earth looks like the ocean!</p>
 <p>XX. Thou art not a scholar, thou art not a recluse;<br>
 Thou wilt not be called a monarch in the day of necessity.<br>
 Alas! Cynddilig, that thou wert not a woman!</p>
 <p>XXI. Let the crooked hart bound at the top of the sheltered vale;<br>
 May the ice be broken; bare are the lowlands;<br>
 The brave escapes from many a hardship.</p>
 <p>XXII. The thrush has a spotted breast,<br>
 Spotted the breast of the thrush;<br>
 The edge of the bank is broken<br>
 By the hoof of the lean, crooked, and stooping hart.</p>
 <p>XXIII. Very high is the loud-sounding wind;<br>
 It is scarcely right for one to stand out.</p>
 <p>XXIV. At All-Saints it is habitual for the heath-tops to be dun;<br>
 High-foaming is the sea-wave,<br>
 Short the day:--Druid, your advice!</p>
 <p><a name="page_324"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 324</font></a></p>
 <p>XXV. If the shield, and the vigour of the steed,<br>
 And of brave, fearless men, have gone to sleep,<br>
 The night is fair to chase the foe.</p>
 <p>XXVI. The wind is supreme; sore and bare the trees,<br>
 Withered the reeds; the hart is bounding;<br>
 Pelis the False, what land is this?</p>
 <p>XXVII. If it poured down snow as far as Arvwl Melyn,<br>
 Gloom would not make me sad;<br>
 I would lead a host to the hill of Tydwl.</p>
 <p>XXVIII. For thou knowest, with equal ease, the causeway,<br>
 The ford, and the ascent, if snow were to fall,<br>
 When thou, Pelis, art our guide.</p>
 <p>XXX. Anxiety in Prydain will not cause me to-night<br>
 To march upon a region where there is the greatest wailing,<br>
 From following after Owain.</p>
 <p>XXXI. Since thou bearest arms and shield upon thee,<br>
 Defender of the destructive battle,<br>
 Pelis, in what land wast thou fostered?</p>
 <p>XXXI. The man whom God releases from a very close prison,<br>
 Ruddy will be his spear from the territory of Owain,<br>
 Lavish of his entertainments.</p>
 <p>XXXII. Since the chieftain is gone to earth,<br>
 Pursue not his family;<br>
 After mead seek no disgrace.</p>
 <p><a name="page_325"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 325</font></a></p>
 <p>XXXIII. The morning with the dawn of day,<br>
 When Mwg Mawr Drefydd was assaulted,<br>
 The steeds of Mechydd were not trained up.</p>
 <p>XXXIV. Joy will be to me of no benefit,<br>
 Owing to the news which apprises me<br>
 That a wooden cover is upon Mechydd!</p>
 <p>XXXV. They met around Cavall;<br>
 A corpse is there in blood through injustice,<br>
 From the rencounter of Rhun and the other hero.</p>
 <p>XXXVI. For the staffers of Mwg have slain Mechydd;<br>
 Drudwas did not perceive the day;<br>
 Creator of heaven! thou hast caused me severe affliction!</p>
 <p>XXXVII. Men are in the shout (of war); the ford is frozen over;<br>
 Cold the wave, variegated the bosom of the sea;<br>
 The eternal God give us counsel!</p>
 <p>XXXVIII. Mechydd, the son of Llywarch, the undaunted chief,<br>
 Fine and fair was his robe of the colour of the swan,<br>
 The first that fastened a horse by the bridle.</p>
