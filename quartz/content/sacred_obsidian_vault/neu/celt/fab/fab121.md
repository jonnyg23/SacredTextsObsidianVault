 <p>I WONDER that there is not proclaimed<br>
 An acknowledgment of heaven to the earth.<br>
 Of the coming of a giant Ruler,<br>
 Alexander the Great.<br>
 Alexander, possessor of multitudes.<br>
 Passionate, iron-gifted, <a name="page_568%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 568 </font></a><br>
 Eminent for sword-strokes.<br>
 He went under the sea,<br>
 Under the sea he went,<br>
 10 To seek for science.<br>
 Whoever seeks science,<br>
 Let him be clamorous in mind.<br>
 He went above the wind,<br>
 Between two griffins on a journey,<br>
 To see a sight.<br>
 A sight he saw,<br>
 The present was not sufficient.<br>
 He saw a wonder.<br>
 A superiority of lineage with fishes.<br>
 20 What he desired in his mind,<br>
 He had from the world.<br>
 And also at his end<br>
 With God, mercy.</p>
