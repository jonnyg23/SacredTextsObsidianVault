 <h2 align="CENTER">POEMS RELATING TO URIEN REGED.</h2>

 <p align="CENTER"></p>
 <p>I HAVE freely greeted, I will freely greet, the familiar greeter of<br>
 Urien Reged. May he diffuse his joy abroad!<br>
 Gold and silver, how great their consumption and destruction.<br>
 (Even) before they could come between the hands of the scatterer!<br>
 Ieuav caused loss and sorrow for horses daily;<br>
 Ceneu his brother, dilatory in the conflict, was not skilful;<br>
 Urien made retaliation for the dishonour<br>
 Of Cynin the active, ignominious was their execution.<br>
 About Aerven, all uncovered precipice, there will come an army.<br>
 10 Selev has been captured; he was incensed for what was to come.<br>
 It will fare worse with the free and the bond on their account,<br>
 Blades will be reddened, through proud words for the fruit of their trees.<br>
 The four men will maintain the place of four hundred,<br>
 With the deepest water. I would bless the corrupt in the enclosure on their account;<br>
 And whoever obtains it, may he be blessed for ever!<br>
 There will befall a loss from confiding in the claimant; <br>
 And hands without thumbs, and blades on the flesh, and a poor muster.<br>
 Puerile age will not be harmonious in the distraction.<br>
 There will be no fellowship, nor confidence in any toward others.<br>
 20 A dragon from Gwynedd of precipitous lands and gentle towns,<br>
 To the Lloegrians will go, when the report of him will spread abroad.<br>
 Stonework will be broken, with terrible destruction, in the encounter;<br>
 And more will be lost than spared of the Gwyndodians.<br>
 From mutual counselling, there will be means of deliverance by sea and land.<br>
 There will arise from concealment a man that will be a blessing to the Gwyndodians;<br>
 And the Brythyon, though a remnant, will be victorious over the ungentle multitude.<br>
 There will come a time when song will not be cherished, nor will it be elaborate;<br>
 The ruler will love wealth, and one sister will be bearish to another.<br>
 Killing and drowning from Eleri as far as Chwilvynydd,<br>
 30 A conquering and unmerciful one will triumph;<br>
 Small will be his army in returning from the (action of) Wednesday.<br>
 A bear from the south, will arise, meet<br>
 The Lloegrians, and kill vast numbers of Powysians.<br>
 The affair of Cors Vochno, he that will escape from it will be fortunate;<br>
 There will be twelve women, and no wonder, for one man.<br>
 The age of youth will fare unbecomingly worse;<br>
 After the tumultuous extermination, a bearded man in a hundred will not be a warrior. <a name="page_343"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 343</font></a><br>
 Urien of Reged, generous he is, and will be,<br>
 And has been since Adam.<br>
 40 He, proud in the hall, has the most wide-spreading sword<br>
 Among the thirteen kings of the North.<br>
 Do I know his name--Aneurin the poet with the flowing song,<br>
 I being Taliesin, from the borders of the lake of Geirionnyidd?<br>
 May I not, when old,<br>
 Support my sore necessity,<br>
 If I praise not Urien. Amen.</p>
