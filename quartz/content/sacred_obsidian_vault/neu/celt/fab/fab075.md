 <h3 align="CENTER">BOOK OF TALIESSIN XLVII.</h3>
 <p align="CENTER"></p>
 <p>THE Awen foretells the hastening of<br>
 The multitude, possessed of wealth and peace,<br>
 And a bountiful sovereign, and eloquent princes,<br>
 And after tranquillity, commotion in every place.<br>
 The seven sons of Beli arose.<br>
 Caswallawn, and Lludd, and Cestuddyn,<br>
 Diwed, Plo, Coll, Iago from the land of Prydyn.<br>
 A country boiling will be made as far as Balaon.<br>
 Tired out their nails, ready for journeying their reins.<br>
 10 Borderers of a ravaging country.<br>
 The Cymry lost all their bounty.<br>
 In the alliance of the sovereign's servants,<br>
 Llyminawg will appear<br>
 Who will be an ambitious man,<br>
 To subdue Mona,<br>
 And to ruin Gwynedd,<br>
 From its extremity to its centre.<br>
 From its beginning, from its end,<br>
 And to take its pledges.<br>
 20 Persevering his face,<br>
 He will submit to none,<br>
 Whether Cymry or Saxons.<br>
 A person will come from concealment,,<br>
 That will make an universal stain of red,<br>
 And a battle of strifes.<br>
 Another will come,<br>
 Far-extending his armies,<br>
 A triumph to the Brython.</p>
