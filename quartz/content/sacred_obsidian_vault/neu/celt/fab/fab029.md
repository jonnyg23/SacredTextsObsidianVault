 <h3 align="CENTER">XIII.</h3>
 <h3 align="CENTER">THE BATTLE OF GODEU.</h3>
 <h3 align="CENTER">BOOK OF TALIESSIN VIII.</h3>
 <p align="CENTER"></p>
 <p>I HAVE been in a multitude of shapes,<br>
 Before I assumed a consistent form.<br>
 I have been a sword, narrow, variegated,<br>
 I will believe when it is apparent. <a name="page_277"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 277</font></a><br>
 I have been a tear in the air,<br>
 I have been the dullest of stars.<br>
 I have been a word among letters,<br>
 I have been a book in the origin.<br>
 I have been the light of lanterns<br>
 10 A year and a half.<br>
 I have been a continuing bridge,<br>
 Over three score Abers.<br>
 I have been a course, I have been an eagle.<br>
 I have been a coracle in the seas:<br>
 I have been compliant in the banquet.<br>
 I have been a drop in a shower;<br>
 I have been a sword in the grasp of the hand:<br>
 I have been a shield in battle.<br>
 I have been a string in a harp,<br>
 20 Disguised for nine years.<br>
 In water, in foam.<br>
 I have been sponge in the fire,<br>
 I have been wood in the covert.<br>
 I am not he who will not sing of<br>
 A combat though small,<br>
 The conflict in the battle of Godeu of sprigs.<br>
 Against the Guledig of Prydain,<br>
 There passed central horses,<br>
 Fleets full of riches.<br>
 30 There passed an animal with wide jaws,<br>
 On it there were a hundred heads.<br>
 And a battle was contested<br>
 Under the root of his tongue;<br>
 And another battle there is<br>
 In his <i>occiput</i>.<br>
 A black sprawling toad,<br>
 With a hundred claws on it.<br>
 A snake speckled, crested. <a name="page_278"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 278</font></a><br>
 A hundred souls through sin<br>
 40 Shall be tormented in its flesh.<br>
 I have been in Caer Vevenir,<br>
 Thither hastened grass and trees,<br>
 Minstrels were singing,<br>
 Warrior-bands were wondering,<br>
 At the exaltation of the Brython,<br>
 That Gwydyon effected.<br>
 There was a calling on the Creator,<br>
 Upon Christ for causes,<br>
 Until when the Eternal<br>
 50 Should deliver those whom he had made.<br>
 The Lord answered them,<br>
 Through language and elements:<br>
 Take the forms of the principal trees,<br>
 Arranging yourselves in battle array,<br>
 And restraining the public.<br>
 Inexperienced in battle hand to band.<br>
 When the trees were enchanted,<br>
 In the expectation of not being trees,<br>
 The trees uttered their voices<br>
 60 From strings of harmony,<br>
 The disputes ceased.<br>
 Let us cut short heavy days,<br>
 A female restrained the din.<br>
 She came forth altogether lovely.<br>
 The head of the line, the head was a female.<br>
 The advantage of a sleepless cow<br>
 Would not make us give way.<br>
 The blood of men up to our thighs,<br>
 The greatest of importunate mental exertions<br>
 70 Sported in the world.<br>
 And one has ended<br>
 From considering the deluge, <a name="page_279"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 279</font></a><br>
 And Christ crucified,<br>
 And the day of judgment near at hand.<br>
 The alder-trees, the head of the line,<br>
 Formed the van.<br>
 The willows and quicken-trees<br>
 Came late to the army.<br>
 Plum-trees, that are scarce,<br>
 80 Unlonged for of men.<br>
 The elaborate medlar-trees,<br>
 The objects of contention.<br>
 The prickly rose-bushes,<br>
 Against a host of giants,<br>
 The raspberry brake did<br>
 What is better failed<br>
 For the security of life.<br>
 Privet and woodbine<br>
 And ivy on its front,<br>
 90 Like furze to the combat<br>
 The cherry-tree was provoked.<br>
 The birch, notwithstanding his high mind,<br>
 Was late before he was arrayed.<br>
 Not because of his cowardice,<br>
 But on account of his greatness.<br>
 The laburnum held in mind,<br>
 That your wild nature was foreign.<br>
 Pine-trees in the porch,<br>
 The chair of disputation,<br>
 100 By me greatly exalted,<br>
 In the presence of kings.<br>
 The elm with his retinue,<br>
 Did not go aside a foot;<br>
 He would fight with the centre,<br>
 And the flanks, and the rear.<br>
 Hazel-trees, it was judged <a name="page_280"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 280</font></a><br>
 That ample was thy mental exertion.<br>
 The privet, happy his lot,<br>
 The bull of battle, the lord of the world.<br>
 110 Morawg and Morydd<br>
 Were made prosperous in pines.<br>
 Holly, it was tinted with green,<br>
 He was the hero.<br>
 The hawthorn, surrounded by prickles,<br>
 With pain at his hand.<br>
 The aspen-wood has been topped,<br>
 It was topped in battle.<br>
 The fern that was plundered.<br>
 The broom, in the van of the army,<br>
 120 In the trenches he was hurt.<br>
 The gorse did not do well,<br>
 Notwithstanding let it overspread.<br>
 The heath was victorious, keeping off on all sides.<br>
 The common people were charmed,<br>
 During the proceeding of the men.<br>
 The oak, quickly moving,<br>
 Before him, tremble heaven and earth.<br>
 A valiant door-keeper against an enemy,<br>
 His name is considered.<br>
 130 The blue-bells combined,<br>
 And caused a consternation.<br>
 In rejecting, were rejected,<br>
 Others, that were perforated.<br>
 Pear-trees, the best intruders<br>
 In the conflict of the plain.<br>
 A very wrathful wood,<br>
 The chestnut is bashful,<br>
 The opponent of happiness,<br>
 The jet has become black, <a name="page_281"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 281</font></a><br>
 140 The mountain has become crooked,<br>
 The woods have become a kiln,<br>
 Existing formerly in the great seas,<br>
 Since was heard the shout:--<br>
 The tops of the birch covered us with leaves,<br>
 And transformed us, and changed our faded state.<br>
 The branches of the oak have ensnared us<br>
 From the Gwarchan of Maelderw.<br>
 Laughing on the side of the rock,<br>
 The lord is not of an ardent nature.<br>
 150 Not of mother and father,<br>
 When I was made,<br>
 Did my Creator create me.<br>
 Of nine-formed faculties,<br>
 Of the fruit of fruits,<br>
 Of the fruit of the primordial God,<br>
 Of primroses and blossoms of the hill,<br>
 Of the flowers of trees and shrubs.<br>
 Of earth, of an earthly course,<br>
 When I was formed.<br>
 160 Of the flower of nettles,<br>
 Of the water of the ninth wave.<br>
 I was enchanted by Math,<br>
 Before I became immortal,<br>
 I was enchanted by Gwydyon<br>
 The great purifier of the Brython,<br>
 Of Eurwys, of Euron,<br>
 Of Euron, of Modron.<br>
 Of five battalions of scientific ones,<br>
 Teachers, children of Math.<br>
 170 When the removal occurred,<br>
 I was enchanted by the Guledig.<br>
 When he was half-burnt,<br>
 I was enchanted by the sage <a name="page_282"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 282</font></a><br>
 Of sages, in the primitive world.<br>
 When I had a being;<br>
 When the host of the world was in dignity,<br>
 The bard was accustomed to benefits.<br>
 To the song of praise I am inclined, which the tongue recites.<br>
 I played in the twilight,<br>
 180 I slept in purple;<br>
 I was truly in the enchantment<br>
 With Dylan, the son of the wave.<br>
 In the circumference, in the middle,<br>
 Between the knees of kings,<br>
 Scattering spears not keen,<br>
 From heaven when came,<br>
 To the great deep, floods,<br>
 In the battle there will be<br>
 Four score hundreds,<br>
 190 That will divide according to their will.<br>
 They are neither older nor younger,<br>
 Than myself in their divisions.<br>
 A wonder, Canhwr arc born, every one of nine hundred.<br>
 He was with me also,<br>
 With my sword spotted with blood.<br>
 Honour was allotted to me<br>
 By the Lord, and protection (was) where he was.<br>
 If I come to where the boar was killed,<br>
 He will compose, he will decompose,<br>
 200 He will form languages.<br>
 The strong-handed gleamer, his name,<br>
 With a gleam he rules his numbers.<br>
 They would spread out in a flame,<br>
 When I shall go on high.<br>
 I have been a speckled snake on the hill, <a name="page_283"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 283</font></a><br>
 I have been a viper in the Llyn.<br>
 I have been a bill-hook crooked that cuts,<br>
 I have been a ferocious spear<br>
 With my chasuble and bowl<br>
 210 I will prophesy not badly,<br>
 Four score smokes<br>
 On every one what will bring.<br>
 Five battalions of arms<br>
 Will be caught by my knife.<br>
 Six steeds of yellow hue<br>
 A hundred times better is<br>
 My cream-coloured steed,<br>
 Swift as the sea-mew<br>
 Which will not pass<br>
 220 Between the sea and the shore.<br>
 Am I not pre-eminent in the field of blood?<br>
 Over it are a hundred chieftains.<br>
 Crimson (is) the gem of my belt,<br>
 Gold my shield border.<br>
 There has not been born, in the gap,<br>
 That has been visiting me,<br>
 Except Goronwy,<br>
 From the dales of Edrywy.<br>
 Long white my fingers,<br>
 230 It is long since I have been a herdsman.<br>
 I travelled in the earth,<br>
 Before I was a proficient in learning.<br>
 I travelled, I made a circuit,<br>
 I slept in a hundred islands.<br>
 A hundred Caers I have dwelt in.<br>
 Ye intelligent Druids,<br>
 Declare to Arthur,<br>
 What is there more early<br>
 Than I that they sing of. <a name="page_284"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 284</font></a><br>
 240 And one is come<br>
 From considering the deluge,<br>
 And Christ crucified,<br>
 And the day of future doom.<br>
 A golden gem in a golden jewel.<br>
 I am splendid<br>
 And shall be wanton<br>
 From the oppression of the metal-workers.</p>
