 <h3 align="CENTER">RED BOOK OF HERGEST X.</h3>
 <p align="CENTER"></p>
 <p>I. SITTING high upon a hill, battle-inclined is<br>
 My mind, and it does not impel me onward:<br>
 Short is my journey, my tenement is laid waste.</p>
 <p>II. Sharp is the gale, it is bare punishment to live;<br>
 When the trees array themselves in gay colours<br>
 Of summer; violently ill I am this day.</p>
 <p>III. I am no hunter, I keep no animal of the chase;<br>
 I cannot move about:<br>
 As long as it pleases the cuckoo, let her sing!</p>
 <p>IV. The loud-voiced cuckoo sings with the dawn,<br>
 Her melodious notes in the dales of Cuawg:<br>
 Better is the lavisher than the miser.</p>
 <p>V. At Aber Cuawg the cuckoos sing,<br>
 On the blossom-covered branches:<br>
 The loud-voiced cuckoo, let her sing a while!</p>
 <p><a name="page_581"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 581</font></a></p>
 <p>VI. At Aber Cuawg the cuckoos sing,<br>
 On the blossom-covered branches:<br>
 Woe to the sick that hears their contented notes.</p>
 <p>VII. At Aber Cuawg the cuckoos sing:<br>
 The recollection is in my mind!<br>
 There are that hear them that will not bear them again!</p>
 <p>VIII. Have I not listened to the cuckoo on the ivied tree?<br>
 Did not my shield hang down?<br>
 What I loved is but vexation; what I loved is no more.</p>
 <p>IX. High above the merry oak,<br>
 I have listened to the song of birds.<br>
 The loud cuckoo--every one remembers what he loves.</p>
 <p>X. Songstress with the solacing song! her voice is grief exciting:<br>
 Subject to wander, with the flight of the hawk,<br>
 The loquacious cuckoo at Aber Cuawg.</p>
 <p>XI. The birds are clamorous; humid are the glens:<br>
 Let the moon shine; cold the midnight hour:<br>
 Distracted is my mind from the torment of disorder.</p>
 <p>XII. White-topped is the cliff; long the midnight hour:<br>
 Every ingenious one-will be honoured:<br>
 I owe the indulgence of sleep to old age.</p>
 <p>XIII. The birds are clamorous; the beach is wet:<br>
 Let the leaves fall; the exile is unconcerned:<br>
 I will not conceal it, I am ill this night.</p>
 <p>XIV. The birds are clamorous; the strand is wet:<br>
 Clear is the sky; large the wave:<br>
 The heart is palsied with longing.</p>
 <p><a name="page_582"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 582</font></a></p>
 <p>XV. The birds are clamorous; the strand is wet:<br>
 Conspicuous is the wave with its ample range:<br>
 What was formed in my youth,<br>
 I could love, if I could have it again.</p>
 <p>XVI. Clamorous are the birds on the scent;<br>
 Loud the cry of dogs in a desert;<br>
 Again clamorous are the birds.</p>
 <p>XVII. In the beginning of summer, gay are all varied seeds!<br>
 When the warriors hasten to the conflict,<br>
 I do not go, infirmity will not leave me.</p>
 <p>XVIII. In the beginning of summer, it is glorious on the course,<br>
 When the warriors hasten to the field of battle;<br>
 I shall not go, infirmity separates me.</p>
 <p>XIX. Hoary is the mountain summit; the tops of the ash are brittle:<br>
 From the Abers the fair wave is impelled:<br>
 Laughter is far from my heart.</p>
 <p>XX. What is it to me this day at the end of the month?<br>
 In the social banquet I have left it:<br>
 Distracted is my mind; a fever has made choice of me.</p>
 <p>XXI. Quick is the sight of the sentinel;<br>
 Let the idle use courtesy:<br>
 Distracted is my mind; disease preys upon me.</p>
 <p>XXII. Riches like a bowl encircling mead,<br>
 The happy man will not wish for:<br>
 It is a precious thing to know patience.</p>
 <p><a name="page_583"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 583</font></a></p>
 <p>XXIII. Riches like a bowl round the cheering beverage,<br>
 The gliding stream, the refreshing shower,<br>
 And the deep ford: the mind is stirred to treachery.</p>
 <p>XXIV. To foment treachery is an iniquitous deed;<br>
 There will be pain where there will be purifying;<br>
 It is to sell a little for much.</p>
 <p>XXV. Let the wicked be fomenting treachery;<br>
 When God will judge, at the long day,<br>
 Dark will be falsehood, truth clear.</p>
 <p>XXVI. There is danger in repelling the graduated visitor;<br>
 Men are joyous over the beverage:<br>
 Frail is the reed, of riches an emblem.</p>
 <p>XXVII. Hear the wave of sullen din, and loud,<br>
 Amidst the pebbles and gravel:<br>
 Distracted is my mind from delirium this night.</p>
 <p>XXVIII. Branching is the top of the oak; bitter the taste of the ash:<br>
 Sweet the cow-parsnip; the wave is laughing:<br>
 The cheek will not conceal the affliction of the heart.</p>
 <p>XXIX. The heaving sigh tells upon me,<br>
 After my experience  .    .    .    .    .<br>
 God will not bestow on the wicked what is good.</p>
 <p>XXX. To the wicked what is good will not be given;<br>
 But sorrow and anxiety:<br>
 God will not undo what he is doing,</p>
 <p><a name="page_584"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 584</font></a></p>
 <p>XXXI. The son of sickness has been a brisk youth, he had<br>
 An active share in the court of the king;<br>
 May God be propitious to the diviner!</p>
 <p>XXXII. As to what is being done, it will come to pass,<br>
 Let him that reads it consider:<br>
 What is detested by man here, is detested by God above.</p>
