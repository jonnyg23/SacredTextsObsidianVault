 <p>I. NOT to call upon God, whose favour defends<br>
 Both the innocent and the angels,<br>
 Is too much of false pride;<br>
 Woe to him that does it openly in the world.</p>
 <p>II. I love not treasure with traces of dwellings no longer existing;<br>
 Everything in the present state is like a summer habitation.<br>
 I am a man to Him whose praise is above all things,<br>
 To the most high God who made me.</p>

 <p>III. I love to praise Peter, who can bestow true peace,<br>
 And with him his far-extending virtues;<br>
 In every language he is, with hope, acknowledged<br>
 As the gentle, high-famed, generous porter of heaven.</p>
 <p>IV. God I will implore to grant a request,<br>
 Lord, be Eloi my Protector!<br>
 That to my soul, for fear of torments,<br>
 Be the whole protection of all the martyrs.</p>
 <p>V. Of God I will ask another request,<br>
 That my soul, to be safe from the torments of enemies,<br>
 And held in remembrance, may have<br>
 The protection of the Virgin Mary and the holy maidens.</p>
 <p>VI. Of God I will ask a request also,<br>
 Just is be, and able to defend me,<br>
 That to my soul, for fear of terrible torments,<br>
 Be the protection of the Christians of the world.</p>
 <p>VII. Of God I will ask a considerate request,<br>
 That, being ready and diligent at all matins,<br>
 To my soul, for fear of punishment,<br>
 May be the protection of God and all the saints.<br>
           Not to call upon God--</p>
