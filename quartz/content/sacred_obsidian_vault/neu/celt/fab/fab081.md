 <p>I. BLESSED is the birch in the valley of the Gwy,<br>
 Whose branches will fall off one by one, two by two,<br>
 It will remain when there will be a battle in Ardudwy, <a name="page_482"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 482</font></a><br>
 And the lowing together of cattle about the ford of Mochnwy,<br>
 And spears and shouting at Dyganwy,<br>
 And Edwin bearing sway in Mona,<br>
 And youths pale and light<br>
 In ruddy clothes commanding them.</p>
 <p>II. Blessed is the birch in Pumlumon,<br>
 Which will see when the front of the stag shall be exalted,<br>
 And which will see the Franks clad in mail,<br>
 And about the hearth food for whelps,<br>
 And monks frequently riding on steeds.</p>
 <p>III. Blessed is the birch in the heights of Dinwythwy,<br>
 Which will know when there shall be a battle in Ardudwy,<br>
 And spears uplifted around Edrywy,<br>
 And a bridge on the Taw, and another on the Tawy,<br>
 And another, on account of a misfortune, on the two banks of the Gwy,<br>
 And the artificer that will make it, let his name be Garwy;<br>
 And may the principal of Mona have dominion over it.<br>
 Women will be under the Gynt, and men in affliction.<br>
 Happier than I is he who will welcome<br>
 The time of Cadwaladyr: a song he may sing!</p>
