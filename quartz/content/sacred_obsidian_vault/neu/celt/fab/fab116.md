 <p align="CENTER"></p>
 <p>THE Hebrews took upon the sons of Israel,<br>
 High in mind,<br>
 A joint number in succession.<br>
 They approached.<br>
 God kept vengeance<br>
 On the people of Pharaonus.<br>
 Ten plagues paining<br>
 Before their being drowned<br>
 In the bottomless sea.<br>
 10 The first plague, fish destroying<br>
 With unusual cold.<br>
 The second plague, frogs abundant,<br>
 They filled the rivers,<br>
 The houses and furniture,<br>
 And couches,<br>
 And closets of meat.<br>
 The third, gnats,<br>
 Bold and sharp, were arranged.<br>
 The fourth, a: sharp watery humour<br>
 90 Strikes in the manner of winged insects.<br>
 Next were devoured<br>
 The fruits of the trees and the field<br>
 By a crop of flies. <a name="page_560"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 560</font></a><br>
 The fifth, murrain.<br>
 On all the children<br>
 Of the Egyptians,<br>
 Animals were destroyed.<br>
 With a heavy disease<br>
 They were all smitten.<br>
 30 The sixth, without deceit,<br>
 Sweating imposthumes,<br>
 The scars of ants.<br>
 The seventh, thunder,<br>
 Hail and fire,<br>
 And rain destructive.<br>
 Wind blasting the tops,<br>
 On leaves and shrubs.<br>
 The eighth, locusts,<br>
 Broad their ears,<br>
 40 Devouring flowers.<br>
 The ninth, prodigious<br>
 To be spoken of, terrible,<br>
 Like waves floating<br>
 Black darkness.<br>
 With a countenance gloomy.<br>
 Tenth, in the night<br>
 The greatest affliction<br>
 On the People of the tribes,<br>
 Christ Jesus, Christians, are prostrate<br>
 50 Until they are in shelter.<br>
 The six hundred warriors<br>
 Of the Hebrew soldiers.</p>
