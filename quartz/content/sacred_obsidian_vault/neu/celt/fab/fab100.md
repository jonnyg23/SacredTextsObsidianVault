 <p>I. A BLESSING to the happy youth and to the fair kingdom!<br>
 Large is the wave, capacious the breast.<br>
 God is his name in the depth of every language.<br>
 Thou with energy didst overshadow the pure Mary;<br>
 Well hast Thou come in human form.<br>
 Behold here the Son of glorious hope,<br>
 Whose death proceeded from Idas.<br>
 He was, by his treachery and disgraceful conduct,<br>
 A deluder in the gentle service of his Lord;<br>
 Cunning was he, but he was not wise;<br>
 And until the judgment I know not his destination.<br>
 If a bard were every poet that is<br>
 On earth, on the brine and on the cultivated plain,<br>
 On the sand and on the seas, and in the stars of astronomy,<br>
 The giver with the gentle and ready hand being judge,<br>
 More than they could I should wish, and also do,<br>
 To relate the power and bounty of the Creator.<br>
 Great God! to-day is thy majesty extolled.</p>
 <p>II. The blessing of the nine hosts of heaven on the mysterious<br>
 Creator, the mighty God and dominator,<br>
 Who has created the light of gladness,<br>
 And generous brightness of the sun in the day, <a name="page_517"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 517</font></a><br>
 Like the Christian's lamp, it shines above the deep,<br>
 A thousand times greater than the moon.<br>
 And a third wonder is, the agitation of the sea;<br>
 How it ebbs, how it swells,<br>
 How it goes, how it comes, how it rolls, how it settles;<br>
 How long will it go, or how will it be?<br>
 At the end of seven years,<br>
 The Creator will check its course,<br>
 Until it comes to its former state.<br>
 We will worship him who causes it, the mighty<br>
 God, the Son of Mary, who created heaven and earth.<br>
 When thou camest on Easter eve<br>
 From Uffern, what was thy portion became liberated;<br>
 Creator of heaven! may we purchase thy loving-kindness!</p>
