 <p align="CENTER"></p>
 <p>THE declaration of a clear song,<br>
 Of unbounded Awen,<br>
 About a warrior of two authors,<br>
 Of the race of the steel Ala.<br>
 With his staff and his wisdom,<br>
 And his swift irruptions,<br>
 And his sovereign prince,<br>
 And his scriptural number,<br>
 And his red purple,<br>
 10 And his assault over the wall,<br>
 And his appropriate chair,<br>
 Amongst the retinue of the wall.<br>
 Did not (he) lead from Cawrnur<br>
 Horses pale supporting burdens?<br>
 The sovereign elder.<br>
 The generous feeder.<br>
 The third deep wise one,<br>
 To bless Arthur,<br>
 Arthur the blessed,<br>
 20 In a compact song.<br>
 On the face in battle,<br>
 Upon him, a restless activity.<br>
 Who are the three chief ministers<br>
 That guarded the country? <a name="page_260"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 260</font></a><br>
 Who are the three skilful (ones)<br>
 That kept the token?<br>
 That will come with eagerness<br>
 To meet their lord?<br>
 High (is) the virtue of the course,<br>
 30 High will be the gaiety of the old,<br>
 High (is) the horn of travelling,<br>
 High the kine in the evening.<br>
 High (is) truth when it shines,<br>
 Higher when it speaks.<br>
 High when came from the cauldron<br>
 The three awens of Gogyrwen.<br>
 I have been Mynawg, wearing a collar,<br>
 With a horn in my hand.<br>
 He deserves not the chair<br>
 40 That keeps not my word.<br>
 With me is the splendid chair,<br>
 The inspiration of fluent (and) urgent song.<br>
 What the name of the three Caers,<br>
 Between the flood and the ebb?<br>
 No one knows who is not pressing<br>
 The offspring of their president.<br>
 Four Caers there are,<br>
 In Prydain, stationary,<br>
 Chiefs tumultuous.<br>
 50 As for what may not be, it will not be.<br>
 It will not be, because it may not be.<br>
 Let him be a conductor of fleets.<br>
 Let the billow cover over the shingle,<br>
 That the land becomes ocean,<br>
 So that it leaves not the cliffs,<br>
 Nor hill nor dale,<br>
 Nor the least of shelter,<br>
 Against the wind when it shall rage. <a name="page_261"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 261</font></a><br>
 The chair of the sovereign<br>
 60 He that keeps it is skilful.<br>
 Let them be sought there!<br>
 Let the munificent be sought.<br>
 Warriors lost,<br>
 I think in a wrathful manner.<br>
 From the destruction of chiefs,<br>
 In a butchering manner,<br>
 From the loricated Legion,<br>
 Arose the Guledig,<br>
 Around the old renowned boundary.<br>
 70 The sprouting sprigs are broken,<br>
 Fragile in like manner.<br>
 Fickle and dissolving.<br>
 Around the violent borders.<br>
 Are the flowing languages.<br>
 The briskly-moving stream<br>
 Of roving sea-adventurers,<br>
 Of the children of Saraphin.<br>
 A task deep (and) pure<br>
 To liberate Elphin.</p>
