 <p>LIKE a wheel revolving immense courses,<br>
 A weakening affliction is the severe compulsion of taxes,<br>
 The unjust imposition of the ardent dragon of the mountains.<br>
 Terrible is the conflict about the ports and ferries,<br>
 And the hostilities of chieftains to chieftains.<br>
 It is natural that Franks should be highly elated: they will come on a Thursday;<br>
 And for a lady's complaint there will be wars;<br>
 And the country will be wasted, and without land;<br>
 And the key of Rome will be in the hands of commanders;<br>
 10 And the Allmyn will be unable to make assaults;<br>
 And there will be happiness to the Venedotians, who will resort to the South;<br>
 And weakness to the Saxon from his treaties,<br>
 And long depravity from want of laws;<br>
 And Lloegyr will be enfeebled by the treachery of its chiefs,<br>
 And the thrusting of Franks, and tumult in ships,<br>
 And the battle of Dovyr hastening death,<br>
 A wonder for a long life to such as will hear it.<br>
 There will be a wounding through the community owing<br>
 to the disappearance of the partisans<br>
 Of the guileless dragon, dark and light. <a name="page_596"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 596</font></a><br>
 20 Powerful chiefs of noble descent.<br>
 And may He give us of his bounty a pledge<br>
 Of a portion of his feast for ever without privation!</p>
 <p align="RIGHT">Amen.</p>
