 <p align="CENTER"></p>
 <p>I WILL adore the Ruler, chief of every place,<br>
 Him, that supports the heaven: Lord of everything.<br>
 Him, that made the water for every one good,<br>
 Him, that made every gift, and prospers it.<br>
 May Maelgwn of Mona be affected with mead, and affect us, <a name="page_539"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 539</font></a><br>
 From the foaming mead-horns, with the choicest pure liquor,<br>
 Which the bees collect, and do not enjoy.<br>
 Mead distilled sparkling, its praise is everywhere.<br>
 The multitude of creatures which the earth nourishes,<br>
 10 God made for man to enrich him.<br>
 Some fierce, some mute, he enjoys them.<br>
 Some wild, some tame, the Lord makes them.<br>
 Their coverings become clothing.<br>
 For food, for drink, till doom they will continue.<br>
 I will implore the Ruler, sovereign of the country of peace,<br>
 To liberate Elphin from banishment.<br>
 The man who gave me wine and ale and mead.<br>
 And the great princely steeds, beautiful their appearance,<br>
 May he yet give me bounty to the end.<br>
 20 By the will of God, he will give in honour,<br>
 Five five-hundred festivals in the way of peace.<br>
 Elphinian knight of mead, late be thy time of rest.</p>
