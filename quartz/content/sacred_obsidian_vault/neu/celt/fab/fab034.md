 <p>I, BULL of conflict was he, active in dispersing an arrayed army,<br>
 The ruler of hosts, indisposed to anger,<br>
 Blameless and pure his conduct in protecting life.</p>
 <p>II. Against a hero stout was his advance,<br>
 The ruler of hosts, disposer of wrath.<br>
 There will be protection for thee since thou askest it.</p>
 <p>III. For thou hast given me protection<br>
 How warmly wert thou welcomed!<br>
 The hero of hosts, from what region thou comest?</p>
 <p>IV. I come from battle and conflict<br>
 With a shield in my hand;<br>
 Broken is the helmet by the pushing of spears.<br>
 V. I will address thee, exalted man,<br>
 With his shield in distress;<br>
 Brave man, what is thy descent?</p>
 <p>VI. Round-hoofed is my horse, the torment of battle,<br>
 "Whilst I am called Gwyn, the son of Nud,<br>
 The lover of Creurdilad, the daughter of Llud.</p>

 <p>VII. Since it is thou, Gwyn, an upright man,<br>
 From thee there is no concealing;<br>
 I also am Gwydneu Garanhir.</p>
 <p>VIII. He will not leave me in a parley with thee,<br>
 By the bridle, as is becoming;<br>
 But will hasten away to his home on the Tawy.</p>
 <p>IX. It is not the nearest Tawy I speak of to thee,<br>
 But the furthest Tawy;<br>
 Eagle! I will cause the furious sea to ebb.</p>
 <p>X. Polished is my ring, golden my saddle and bright:<br>
 To my sadness<br>
 I saw a conflict before Caer Vandwy.</p>
 <p>XI. Before Caer Vandwy a host I saw,<br>
 Shields were shattered and ribs broken<br>
 Renowned and splendid was he who made the assault.</p>
 <p>XII. Gwyn ab Nud, the hope of armies,<br>
 Sooner would legions fall before the hoofs<br>
 of thy horses, than broken rushes to the ground.</p>
 <p>XIII. Handsome my dog and round-bodied,<br>
 And truly the best of dogs;<br>
 Dormach was he, which belonged to Maelgwn.</p>
 <p>XIV Dormach with the ruddy nose! what a gazer<br>
 Thou art upon me! because I notice<br>
 Thy wanderings on Gwibir Vynyd.</p>
 <p>XV. I have been in the place where was killed Gwondoleu,<br>
 The son of Ceidaw, the pillar of songs,<br>
 When the ravens screamed over blood.</p>
 <p><a name="page_295"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 295</font></a></p>
 <p>XVI. I have been in the place where Bran was killed,<br>
 The son of Gweryd, of far-extending fame,<br>
 When the ravens of the battle-field screamed.</p>
 <p>XVII. I have been where Llachau was slain,<br>
 The son of Arthur, extolled in songs,<br>
 When the ravens screamed over blood.</p>
 <p>XVIII. I have been where Meurig was killed,<br>
 The son of Carreian, of honourable fame,<br>
 When the ravens screamed over flesh.</p>
 <p>XIX. I have not been where Gwallawg was killed,<br>
 The son of Goholeth, the accomplished,.<br>
 The resister of Lloegir, the son of Lleynawg.</p>
 <p>XX. I have been where the soldiers of Prydain were slain,<br>
 From the East to the North;<br>
 I am alive, they in their graves!</p>
 <p>XXI. I have been where the soldiers of Prydain were slain,<br>
 From the East to the South<br>
 I am alive, they in death!</p>
