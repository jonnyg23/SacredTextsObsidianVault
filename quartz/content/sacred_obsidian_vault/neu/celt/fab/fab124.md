 <p>I. THE Calends of winter, hard is the grain;<br>
 The leaves are on the move, the plash is full;<br>
 In the morning before he sets off,<br>
 Woe to him that trusts to a stranger.</p>
 <p>II. The Calends of winter, the time of pleasant gossiping,<br>
 The gale and the storm keep equal pace;<br>
 It is the work of the wise to keep a secret.</p>
 <p>III. The Calends of winter, the stags are lean,<br>
 Yellow, the tops of birch, deserted the summer dwelling;<br>
 Woo to him who for a trifle deserves disgrace.</p>
 <p>IV. The Calends of winter, the tops of the branches are bent;<br>
 Uproar from the mouth of the vicious is common;<br>
 Where there is no natural gift there will be no learning.</p>
 <p>V. The Calends of winter, blustering is the weather,<br>
 Unlike the beginning of summer;<br>
 Except God, there is none that divines.</p>

 <p>VI. The Calends of Winter, gay the plumage of birds;<br>
 Short the day; loud the cuckoos;<br>
 Mercifully has the most beneficent God made them.</p>
 <p>VII, The Calends of winter, it is hard and dry;<br>
 Very black is the raven, quick the arrow from the bow;<br>
 At the stumbling of the old, the smile of the youth is apt to break out.</p>
 <p>VIII. The Calends of winter, lean is the stag:<br>
 Woe to the weak! if he chafes, it will be but for a short while;<br>
 Truly better is amiability than beauty.</p>
 <p>IX. The Calends of winter, bare is where the heath is burnt,<br>
 The plough is in the furrow; the ox at work;<br>
 Amongst a hundred there is hardly a friend.</p>
