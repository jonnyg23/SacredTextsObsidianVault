 <h3 align="CENTER">XCIX.</h3>
 <h3 align="CENTER">BOOK OF TALIESSIN V.</h3>
 <p align="CENTER"></p>
 <p>O GOD, the God of formation,<br>
 Ruler, strengthener of blood.<br>
 Christ Jesus, that guards,<br>
 Princes loud-proclaiming go their course.<br>
 For a decaying acquisition.<br>
 It will not make me without shares,<br>
 The praising thy mercy.<br>
 There hath not been here;<br>
 O supreme Ruler;<br>
 10 There hath not been; there will not be,<br>
 One so good as the Lord.<br>
 There hath not been born in the day of the people<br>
 Any one equal to God.<br>
 And no one will acknowledge<br>
 Any one equal to him. <a name="page_553"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 553</font></a><br>
 Above heaven, below heaven,<br>
 There is no Ruler but he.<br>
 Above sea, below sea,<br>
 He created us.<br>
 20 When God comes<br>
 A great noise will pierce us,<br>
 The day of judgment terribly.<br>
 Messengers from the door,<br>
 Wind, and sea, and fire.<br>
 Lightning and thunder.<br>
 A number without flattery.<br>
 The people of the world groaning<br>
 Will be concealed. A reaching arm will be brought.<br>
 Will be concealed the sea and stars,<br>
 30 When the Father descends,<br>
 To take vengeance with his hosts<br>
 With trumpets penetrating into the four regions.<br>
 And to set the sea on fire.<br>
 The nations of the world will be burnt,<br>
 Until they are reduced to ashes.<br>
 Was burnt the desert portion<br>
 Before his great presence.<br>
 He will draw a stream<br>
 Before his front rank.<br>
 O Kings will shudder (that) day,<br>
 Woe awaits them!<br>
 When the recompenser shall appear,<br>
 Let the heaven appear below.<br>
 A ruddy wind will be brought<br>
 Out to the cinder,<br>
 Until the world is as desolate<br>
 As when created.<br>
 Saint Peter says it,<br>
 The day of the earth; <a name="page_554"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 554</font></a><br>
 50 There will come a Saturday,<br>
 The earth in one furnace.<br>
 Saturday, a clear morning<br>
 The love-diffusing (Lord) will separate us.<br>
 The land of worldly weather,<br>
 A wind will melt the trees:<br>
 There will pass away every tranquillity<br>
 When the mountains are burnt.<br>
 There will be again inhabitants<br>
 With horns before kings;<br>
 60 The mighty One will send them,<br>
 Sea, and land, and lake.<br>
 There will be again a trembling terror,<br>
 And a moving of the earth,<br>
 And above every field,<br>
 And ashes the rocks will be;<br>
 With violent exertion, concealment,<br>
 And burning of lake.<br>
 A wave do ye displace,<br>
 A shield do ye extend<br>
 70 To the travelling woe,<br>
 And violent exertion through grief.<br>
 And inflaming through fury<br>
 Between heaven and earth.<br>
 When the Trinity shall come<br>
 To the field of its majesty,<br>
 The host of heaven about it,<br>
 An extensive tribe near it,<br>
 Songs and minstrels.<br>
 And the hymns of angels,<br>
 80 Will raise from the graves,<br>
 They will entreat from the beginning<br>
 They will entreat together publicly,<br>
 On so great a destiny. <a name="page_555"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 555</font></a><br>
 Those whom the sea has destroyed<br>
 Will make a great shout,<br>
 At the time when cometh<br>
 He, that will separate them.<br>
 As many as are mine,<br>
 Let them go to the right.<br>
 90 Those that have done evil,<br>
 Lot them go to the left side.<br>
 Do not thy passions counteract<br>
 What thy lips utter?<br>
 Thy going in thy course into valleys,<br>
 Dark. without lights.<br>
 And mine were his words.<br>
 And mine were his languages.<br>
 And mine was his bright country,<br>
 And their hundred fulnesses.<br>
 100 The hundredth country present.<br>
 I have not been without battle.<br>
 Bitter affliction was frequent<br>
 Between me and my cousins.<br>
 Frequent trials fell<br>
 between me and my fellow-countrymen.<br>
 There was frequent contention<br>
 Between me and the wretched.<br>
 This ever overcame me,<br>
 Man would never do it.<br>
 110 (Those) that placed me on the cross<br>
 I knew when young.<br>
 That drove me on the tree,<br>
 My head hung down.<br>
 Stretched were my two feet,<br>
 So sad their destiny.<br>
 Stretched with extreme pain<br>
 The bones of my feet. <a name="page_556"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 556</font></a><br>
 Stretched were my two arms,<br>
 Their burden will not be.<br>
 120 Stretched were my two shoulders,<br>
 So diligently it was done.<br>
 Stretched were the nails,<br>
 Within my heart.<br>
 Stretched was the spiking,<br>
 Between my two eyes.<br>
 Thick are the holes<br>
 Of the crown of thorns in my head.<br>
 The lance was struck<br>
 And my side was pierced.<br>
 130 It will be struck to you also,<br>
 As your right hand (struck me).<br>
 To you there will be no forgiveness,<br>
 For piercing me with spears.<br>
 And the Ruler we knew not<br>
 When thou wert hung.<br>
 Ruler of heaven, Ruler of every people!<br>
 We knew not, O Christ! that it was thou.<br>
 If we had known thee,<br>
 Christ, we should have refrained from thee.<br>
 140 A denial will not be received<br>
 From the race of the lower country.<br>
 Ye have committed wickedness<br>
 Against the Creator.<br>
 A hundred thousand angels<br>
 Are to me witnesses,<br>
 Who came to conduct me<br>
 After my hanging,<br>
 When hanging cruelly,<br>
 Myself to deliver me<br>
 150 In heaven there was trembling<br>
 When I had been hung. <a name="page_557"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 557</font></a><br>
 When I cried out Eli!<br>
 God love-prospering above heaven.<br>
 And sing ye, the two Johns,<br>
 Before me the two primary parts.<br>
 With two books in your hands,<br>
 Reading them.<br>
 There would not come a great difficulty<br>
 .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .<br>
 160 And yours will be flattery,<br>
 The value of your foolish speech.<br>
 Dissolution will close.<br>
 Upon you to moist Uffern.<br>
 Christ Jesus high hath founded three hundred thousand years,<br>
 Since he is in life,<br>
 And a second thousand before the cross<br>
 Shone Enoch.<br>
 Do not the brave know<br>
 The greatness of their progeny?<br>
 170 A country present will meet thee,<br>
 And while it may possibly be yours,<br>
 Three hundred thousand years save one,<br>
 A short hour of the day of everlasting life.</p>
