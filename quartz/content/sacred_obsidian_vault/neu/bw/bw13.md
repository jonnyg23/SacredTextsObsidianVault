 <p align="CENTER">FROM<br>
 FINLAND<br>
 OF<br>
 THE THOUSAND LAKES<br>
 LOST DAUGHTER OF THE<br>
 BALTIC SEA</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Where the lovely lilies tremble,<br>
 Golden lilies on the waters;<br>
 Where the fir tree points its candles,<br>
 Points its slender spire towards Heaven;<br>
 And the streams make mighty music,<br>
 From the rocks in cascades foaming--<br>
 There dwells Finland's Baltic Wizard,<br>
 There he makes his Tales of Wonder.<br>
 Welds them on his Forge of Magic,<br>
 Beats them with his Magic Hammer.</p>
 <p>They are wrought from Songs of Magic,<br>
 Songs of ancient Vainamoinen,<br>
 Finland's vanished sweet-tongued Wizard,<br>
 Wrought from Runes of Vainamoinen;<br>
 Till they live and leap and quiver,<br>
 Till they shout with songs and laughter,<br>
 Till they weep with tears of woman,<br>
 Till they stir the heart with pity.<br>
 So makes Finland's Baltic Wizard<br>
 All his Tales of Magic Wonder;<br>
 Beats them on his Forge of Magic,<br>
 Beats them with his Magic Hammer.</p>
