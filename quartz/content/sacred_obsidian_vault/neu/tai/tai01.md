   <h3 align="center">PREFACE.</h3>  
 <p>This is the first English edition of this ancient Russian epic.</p>  
 <p>It is intended as a handbook to the increasing number of students of the Russian language, and to reveal to the general public one of the treasures of Russian medieval literature.</p>  
 <p>The editor has to express his gratitude to many friends without whose encouragement and advice it could never have appeared; and, in especial to Miss J. CURRIE who has drawn the map, as well as to Professor A. P. GOUDY for his illuminative suggestions.</p>
