 <h2 align="center">THE MIRACLE OF ST. NICHOLAS</h2>
 
 D<small>EAR</small> God, great marvel is it unseen wonders to behold!<br>
 
 In St. Paul’s white monastery were tables of the gold,<br>
 
 And all the saints in order were seated. At the head<br>
 
 Was the Thunderer Elijah; where the midst of the board was spread,<br>
 
 Were Máriya and Sava; at the bottom of the board<br>
 
 Were Holy Friday and Sunday. To the glory of Christ the Lord<br>
 
 To drink, and begin the festival, St. Nicholas stood up,<br>
 
 But he fell asleep in a little and in slumber dropped the cup.<br>
 
 It fell on the golden table, but broke not, nor spilled the wine.<br>
 
 <table><tr><td>Elijah then rebuked him: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Nicholas, brother mine,</td></tr></table>
 
 We have not slumbered, brother, though we drank cool wine ere now,<br>
 
 Nor dropped cups from our fingers. Why dost thou slumber so?”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td> Said St. Nicholas: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Elijah the Thunderer, let be!</td></tr></table>
 
 I closed my eyes for a little and a strange dream came to me.<br>

 There were three hundred cáloyers<a name="page_259_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_259_note_1"><font size="1">1</font></a> set sail on the blue sea,<br>
 
 And they bore sacrificial gifts to the famous Holy Height<br>
 
 Of Athos; yellow wax they bore and also incense white.<br>
 
 The wind arose among the clouds; the waves of the sea it smote,<br>
 
 To drown three hundred cáloyers. But they cried as from one throat:<br>
 
 ‘Aid us, God and St. Nicholas! Come, wherever thou mayst be!’<br>
 
 And I aided them and the cáloyers came home again from sea;<br>
 
 Safe home came the three hundred, and O their hearts were light!<br>
 
 They bore the sacrificial gifts unto the Holy Height<br>
 
 Of Athos; yellow wax they bore and white incense as well.<br>
 
 At that time did I slumber, and the cup from my fingers fell.”<br>
