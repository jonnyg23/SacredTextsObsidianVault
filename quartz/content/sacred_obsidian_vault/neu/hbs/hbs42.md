 <h2 align="center">PREDRAG AND NENAD</h2>
 
 A <small>MOTHER</small> reared two tender sons, in a hungry time and year,<br>
 
 At her left and right. And Predrag, that is to say, “Most Dear,”<br>
 
 She named the first with a fair name; also the second son<br>
 
 Nenad she named, that is to say, “the Sudden, Unlooked-for one.”<br>
 
 Predrag grew strong to wield the spear and the steed to ride upon:<br>
 
 He ran away from his mother; unto the wood he sped,<br>
 
 To the hayduks and the outlaws. Nenad his mother bred;<br>
 
 Nenad forgot his brother, nor pondered him upon.<br>
 
 Nenad grew strong to wield the spear and the steed to ride upon:<br>
 
 He ran away from his mother; unto the wood he sped,<br>
 
 To the hayduks and the outlaws. Three years that life he led.<br>
 
 He was a hero fortunate and lucky amid the spears;<br>
 
 His comrades made him their captain; he was their chief three years.<br>
 
 But woe was him for his mother; to his comrades all he spake:<br>
 
  “Comrades,” said he, “now woe is me for my dear mother’s sake!<br>
 
 <p>

 Let us divide our treasures and go to our mothers dear.”<br>
 
  Gladly his comrades thereunto harkened and gave an ear.<br>
 
 When they took out their treasures, each man a great oath sware,<br>
 
 For one sware by his brother and one by his sister fair.<br>
 
 But when Nenad took his treasure, he spake to his comrades by:<br>
 
  “Comrades, my brothers, brother nor sister at all have I;<br>
 
 But—so may the one God hear me!—may this arm be withered and lean,<br>
 
 May the mane of the stallion fall, may rust devour the saber keen,<br>
 
 If any of the treasure I have kept from other men!”<br>
 
  When they had divided the treasure, he mounted his charger then,<br>
 
 The little and the nimble; to his mother forth he went,<br>
 
 And well did she receive him, and they feasted in content.<br>
 
 When they sat down at dinner, said Nenad to the dame:<br>
 
  “My gentle mother, surely before all men is it shame!<br>
 
 I would say thou wert not my mother, ’fore God were it not a sin.<br>
 
 Why didst thou bear me no brother, or sister of my kin?<br>
 
 <p>

 </p>
 
 When my comrades divided the treasure, each man among them sware<br>
 
 A great oath, by his brother or by his sister fair;<br>
 
 But, mother, by myself I sware, and my weapons fair to see,<br>
 
 And also in that hour by the good horse under me.”<br>
 
  “Speak not foolishly, Nenad!” his mother laughed in his face;<br>
 
 “A brother indeed, and one ‘Most Dear,’ have I borne unto thy race.<br>
 
 But yesterday did I hear of him; with the hayduks he abides<br>
 
 In the wood of Gárevitsa, and chief of them all he rides.”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td> Said Nenad: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Mother, now make me new raiment of the green;</td></tr></table>
 
 Short shalt thou make it, fitting in the forest to be seen,<br>
 
 That forth in the wood to find him in this hour I may go,<br>
 
 And that thus may pass from my spirit the weight of living woe.”<br>
 
  His mother dear bespake him: “Speak not like a fool,” said she;<br>
 
 “Nenad, my son, in very truth thou wilt perish miserably.”<br>
 
  But Nenad heard not his mother, nor would harken what she said;<br>
 
 Whate’er was pleasing in his sight, he did that thing instead.<br>
 
 <p>

 He made himself new raiment; he wrought it of the green;<br>
 
 And short he made it, fitting in the forest to be seen.<br>
 
 He mounted the steed; to his brother through the forest did he go,<br>
 
 That thereby might pass from him his weight of living woe.<br>
 
 He made no sound, he spat not, to the steed he spake not at all;<br>
 
 When to Gárevitsa wood he came, like a gray hawk did he call:<br>
 
  “Green wood of Gárevitsa, holdest thou hidden in thee;<br>
 
 The ‘Most Dear,’ my true brother?—My mother’s son is he!<br>
 
 Keepest thou not the hero that will bring my brother to me?”<br>
 
  ’Neath a green fir sat Predrag and drank the yellow wine.<br>
 
 When he heard the voice, he spake to his men: “Ho, comrades good of mine!<br>
 
 Go forth to the road in ambush; for the champion unknown<br>
 
 Ye shall wait; ye shall not rob him, nor shall ye strike him down:<br>
 
 Bring him alive to me, hither. Whate’er his lineage shows,<br>
 
 <table><tr><td>He is kin to me.” </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>And thereupon full thirty lads arose.</td></tr></table>

 In three places were they ambushed, in every place ten men;<br>
 
 But none dared go before him, when he came to the tirst ten,<br>
 
 To seize his steed; and forthwith they shot against him then.<br>
 
 Nenad spake ’mid the arrows: “Wood-brethren, shoot me not,<br>
 
 Lest woe for a brother smite you, such as drove me to this spot.”<br>
 
 The outlaws of the ambush, in peace they let him past.<br>
 
 When he came on to the second ten, the shafts flew fierce and fast.<br>
 
 Said Nenad ’mid the arrows: “Wood-brethren, shoot me not,<br>
 
 Lest woe for a brother smite you, such as drove me to this spot,<br>
 
 For sorrow of him hath smitten me.” In peace they let him past.<br>
 
 When he came to the third ambush, the shafts flew fierce and fast.<br>
 
 Then Nenad the young was angry; he smote the thirty then.<br>
 
 With the edges of the saber he smote on the first ten;<br>
 
 The second ten he trampled with the stallion as he could;<br>
 
 And the third ten he scattered in his anger through the wood,<br>
 
 Some of them in the forest, and some beside the flood.<br>

  One shouted unto Predrag: “A plague on thee alight!<br>
 
 A hero unknown in the forest hath slain thy friends in fight.”<br>
 
  To his nimble feet leaped Predrag; he took his arrows and bow;<br>
 
 Down to the road to the ambush behind a fir did he go.<br>
 
 With an arrow from the stallion he smote down Nenad the young.<br>
 
 In the heart was he hit; he shrieked like a hawk; to the saddlebow he clung,<br>
 
 <table><tr><td>Crying: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Hero of the green wood, may thy right hand wither and dry!</td></tr></table>
 
 God slay thee alive and the right hand the arrow that let fly.<br>
 
 May thy right eye be blasted wherewith thou hast looked on me!<br>
 
 May woe for a brother smite thee, as erst it smote on me,<br>
 
 Which drove me wretchedly hither, in evil luck to die!”<br>
 
  When Predrag heard, he questioned from the fir tree on high:<br>
 
 “Who art thou, wounded hero, and of what race art thou?”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td> Said Nenad: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Foh! and wherefore thereof dost thou question now?</td></tr></table>
 
 Dost thou seek a maiden in marriage? In faith I will give thee none!<br>
 
 <p>

 I am the hero Nenad, and my mother liveth alone,<br>
 
 And I have but one born brother, a brother born ‘Most Dear,’<br>
 
 And in a bitter hour I sought to find him here,<br>
 
 That thereby at last should pass away the weight of my living woe;<br>
 
 And I came on evil fortune and life’s very overthrow.”<br>
 
  Predrag heard, and let fall the shafts; in bitter terror he was;<br>
 
 He ran to the wounded hero and laid him on the grass:<br>
 
  “Is it thou, my brother Nenad? I am Predrag, thy brother dear.<br>
 
 Canst thou mend of the wound? My raiment I will rend in pieces here,<br>
 
 And heal thee well, and bandage thee with the strips of linen fine.”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td> And the wounded Nenad answered: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Is it thou, brother mine?</td></tr></table>
 
 Glory to God the highest, that I have looked on thee.<br>
 
 The burden of my living woe is passed away from me.<br>
 
 I cannot mend, but of my hurt bloodguiltless mayst thou be!”<br>
 
  So Nenad spake, and thereupon forth his strong spirit went,<br>
 
 And Predrag lifted up his voice with a miserable lament:<br>

  “Ah, Nenad, my fair splendid sun, early for me didst thou rise,<br>
 
 And early set! Ah, basil flower of my green paradise,<br>
 
 Early didst thou bloom, and early didst thou wither here for me!”<br>
 
  From the scabbard at his girdle he wrenched the poniard free;<br>
 
 Right through his heart he plunged it. The blood ran swift and red;<br>
 
 Down brother fell by brother: the dead lay with the dead.<br>
