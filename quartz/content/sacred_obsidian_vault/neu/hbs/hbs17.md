 <h2 align="center">THE MAID OF KÓSOVO</h2>
 
 U<small>P</small> rose the Maid of Kósovo before the break of day,<br>
 
 On a Sunday morn, ere the bright sun had risen on his way.<br>
 
 Unto her milk-white elbows she drew the white sleeves up;<br>
 
 She bore three loaves in a basket, and in either hand a cup;<br>
 
 Two beakers very beautiful, of hammered gold and fine;<br>
 
 The one held silver water, and the other ruddy wine.<br>
 
 She came to level Kósovo in pity and in ruth,<br>
 
 And weeping walked along the place of the battle of the youth,<br>
 
 The places of the slaughter, where the good Tsar Lazar stood;<br>
 
 And with her hands she lifted up the heroes in their blood.<br>
 
 The gallant lads she found alive, she washed with water fine.<br>
 
 She gave them of the milk-white loaves, and cheered them with ruddy wine.<br>
 
 To Pavle Órlovich she came, the ensign of his lord:<br>
 
 As yet he was alive, although sore smitten by the sword;<br>
 
 But by a shred of flesh his arm at the red shoulder hung,<br>
 
 And the wound showed his shattered rib and the white ghastly lung.<br>

 She moved him from the pool of blood, she washed him with water fine;<br>
 
 She gave him of the milk-white loaves and of the ruddy wine.<br>
 
 Gasping for breath he leaned to her, and tremblingly he said:<br>
 
  “My sister, wherefore turnest thou the bodies of the dead?<br>
 
 What hard doom is upon thee, thou Maid of Kósovo,<br>
 
 That thou liftest up the heroes whose crests are fallen low?<br>
 
 Seekest thou then for some young man, whose last good day is done?<br>
 
 For thy father, or thy brother, or thy dear brother’s son?”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td> Answered the Maid of Kósovo: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“O champion unknown!</td></tr></table>
 
 I seek not father, nor nephew, nor a brother of mine own.<br>
 
 Knowest thou, O my brother, how the good Tsar Lazar went<br>
 
 With the squadrons of the army to take the sacrament?<br>
 
 By the fair church in Samodrezha the thirty mass-priests stood<br>
 
 For three weeks, with the offering of Christ his flesh and blood.<br>
 
 Thereby there came three captains, that to communion passed,<br>

 Milosh and Ivan Kósanchich, and Milan Tóplitsa last.<br>
 
 Milosh, the hero of the earth, through the gate before me strode;<br>
 
 The clanking saber at his side rattled along the road;<br>
 
 His silver plume flashed on his cap, of silk was his raiment fair;<br>
 
 His scarf and his spotted mantle, likewise of silk they were.<br>
 
 And forth and round about him his eyes went wanderingly,<br>
 
 Glancing in pride from side to side, until they fell on me.<br>
 
 He doffed the spotted mantle; aloud to me did he cry:<br>
 
  “ ‘Take now the spotted mantle, to remember me thereby.<br>
 
 Lo, I go to perish, dearest, in the leaguer of the tsar!<br>
 
 Pray for me, now, belovèd, that I ride back from the war,<br>
 
 Returning from the battle with a great victory home.<br>
 
 Pray now for me, belovèd, that the good hap may come.<br>
 
 To Milan, my brother sworn to me by God and by St. John,<br>
 
 I will give thee to plight thy troth, when the good morn comes on;<br>
 
 To my brother, my sworn comrade, of the living and the dead,<br>

 For I shall be his groomsman whene’er he shall be wed.’<br>
 
  “After him Ivan, the hero of the earth, before me strode;<br>
 
 The clanking saber at his side rattled along the road;<br>
 
 His silver plume flashed on his cap, of silk was his raiment fair;<br>
 
 His scarf and his spotted mantle, likewise of silk they were.<br>
 
 On his hand he wore a golden ring, and his eyes went wanderingly,<br>
 
 Glancing in pride from side to side, until they fell on me.<br>
 
 He took the ring from his finger; aloud to me did he cry:<br>
 
  “ ‘Take, maiden, now the golden ring, to remember me thereby.<br>
 
 Lo, I go to perish, dearest, in the leaguer of the tsar!<br>
 
 Pray for me now, belovèd, that I ride back from the war,<br>
 
 Returning from the battle with a great victory home.<br>
 
 Pray now for me, belovèd, that the good hap may come.<br>
 
 To Milan, my brother sworn to me by God and by St. John,<br>
 
 I will give thee in marriage, when the good morn comes on.<br>
 
 It is my right in all men’s sight before the priest to stand,<br>

 And like a brother give thee for a bride into his hand.’<br>
 
  “After him Milan, the hero of the earth, before me strode;<br>
 
 The clanking saber at his side rattled along the road;<br>
 
 His silver plume flashed on his cap, of silk was his raiment fair;<br>
 
 His scarf and his spotted mantle, likewise of silk they were.<br>
 
 On his shoulders was a golden cloak, and his eyes went wanderingly,<br>
 
 Glancing in pride from side to side, until they fell on me.<br>
 
 He took the cloak from his shoulders, and aloud to me did he cry:<br>
 
  “ ‘Take, maiden, now the golden cloak, to remember me thereby.<br>
 
 Lo, I go to perish, dearest, in the leaguer of the tsar!<br>
 
 Pray for me now, belovèd, that I ride back from the war,<br>
 
 Returning from the battle with a great victory home.<br>
 
 Pray now for me, belovèd, that the good hap may come—<br>
 
 A fair and lovely fortune in the season when I shall ride<br>
 
 Hither again from the slaughter and the battle to my bride.’<br>
 
  “They went out of the city and the altars where they kneeled,<br>

 And through the broken battle I seek them o’er the field.”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td> Quoth Pavle to the maiden: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Sister, incline thine ear!</td></tr></table>
 
 Seest thou yonder, sister, the splendor of that spear.<br>
 
 To the stirrups of the stallion, the brave blood flowed thereby,<br>
 
 And the horses of the heroes were drenchèd bridle-high;<br>
 
 Stained was the shining armor, their girdles and their greaves.<br>
 
 They are dead, sister. In their blood dip not thy milk-white sleeves,<br>
 
 But get thee from the battle to thy home of the white hall.”<br>
 
  And the maid heard, and with a cry upon her love did call.<br>
 
 She came unto her white-walled home, weeping and wild and pale,<br>
 
 And there she mourned her loss alone, with moaning and with wail:<br>
 
  “Ah miserable! If I reach forth to touch the good green pine,<br>
 
 So will the green bough wither in this sad hand of mine.”<br>
