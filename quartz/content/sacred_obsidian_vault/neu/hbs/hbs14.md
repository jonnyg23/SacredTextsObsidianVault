 <h2 align="center">MUSICH STEVAN</h2>
 
 I<small>N</small> Maydan white as silver, in his fair lordly house,<br>
 
 Idle sits Musich Stevan, on the good wine to carouse.<br>
 
 The servant Váistina poured it forth his thirst to slake,<br>
 
 And Stevan drank his fill thereof, and to the henchman spake:<br>
 
  “My good son Váistina, I will lie down to sleep.<br>
 
 Do thou then eat thy dinner, and of the wine drink deep,<br>
 
 And then look forth on the open sky because of my behest,<br>
 
 To see if the day-star stand in the east, or the clear moon in the west;<br>
 
 To see if the time be come at last for us to gird and go<br>
 
 To the meeting place that the tsar hath set on the field of Kósovo.<br>
 
 Thou knowest the oath we took, my son, and the curse that then was laid<br>
 
 On the voývoda or henchman that Tsar Lazarus betrayed:<br>
 
  “ ‘Who springeth of a Servian house, in whom Serb blood doth run,<br>
 
 Who cometh not to battle at Kósovo, may he never have a son,<br>
 
 And no child of his heart whatever! May naught grow under his hand,<br>
 
 Neither the yellow liquor, nor the white wheat in the land!<br>
 
 <p>

 May he like iron be rusted, and his stock dwindle alway!’ ”<br>
 
  And thereupon brave Stevan on the bolster soft he lay.<br>
 
 Váistina the henchman, he sitteth him down to dine,<br>
 
 And at his good lord’s table he hath his fill of the wine,<br>
 
 And he goeth to look at the open sky because of his lord’s behest,<br>
 
 To see if the day-star stand in the east, or the clear moon in the west.<br>
 
 And he seeth it is the season for them to gird and go<br>
 
 Unto Tsar Lazar’s meeting place in the field of Kósovo.<br>
 
 He went unto the stables and led the horses forth;<br>
 
 He saddled the steeds, and on them set caparisons of worth,<br>
 
 One for himself, and the other is for his lord that tide.<br>
 
 And he bringeth a flag from the palace, with a great cross glorified;<br>
 
 Silk is the flag and golden are the crosses wrought thereon,<br>
 
 And the icon of Stevan’s patron, the icon of St. John.<br>
 
 He set the banner against the wall, and went unto the tower<br>
 
 To wake his lord, but his lady came to him in that hour,<br>
 
 <table><tr><td>And she greeted and embraced him: </td></tr><tr><td> </td></tr><tr><td>

 “My servant Váistina, by God I conjure thee,<br>
 
 And by St. John moreover. A faithful knave art thou,<br>
 
 Henceforth shalt thou be my brother; but awake not thy master now,<br>
 
 Since an evil dream of a flock of doves this night is come to me.<br>
 
 With falcons twain from my lord his place to Kósovo did they flee;<br>
 
 Amid the camp of Murad they lighted nor came again:<br>
 
 That is your omen, brother. So ponder lest you be slain.”<br>
 
  But the servant Váistina, unto the dame said he:<br>
 
  “Sister, I cannot break my faith with the lord of thee and me,<br>
 
 For thou wast not at the swearing, nor knowest what curse was laid<br>
 
 On the voývoda or henchman that Tsar Lazarus betrayed:<br>
 
  “ ‘Who springeth of a Servian house, in whom Serb blood doth run,<br>
 
 Who cometh not to battle at Kósovo, may he never have a son,<br>
 
 And no child of his heart whatever! May naught grow under his hand,<br>
 
 Neither the yellow liquor, nor the white wheat in the land!<br>
 
 May he like iron be rusted, and his stock dwindle alway!’<br>

  “And I dare not break my plighted faith to thy lord and mine this day.”<br>
 
  And he went to his lord in the tower: “Rise up, it is time to go!”<br>
 
 Stevan stood up before him, and washed his neck and brow,<br>
 
 And put on lordly raiment and an inlaid saber fine;<br>
 
 To the fair glory of his God he drank the yellow wine,<br>
 
 And to his own good journey and the fair cross did he drain<br>
 
 The wine at his own table: he drank not there again.<br>
 
  They mounted the two good chargers, they spread the banners abroad;<br>
 
 The drums beat and the flutes blew loud, and the chiefs rode forth with God.<br>
 
 Over the field of Kósovo did the white morning stand;<br>
 
 The Maid of Kósovo met them with a cup in either hand.<br>
 
 The cups are golden and empty. On her arm is a tire for the head,<br>
 
 A cap with milk-white feathers that are wound with silver thread,<br>
 
 And all about the midst thereof is it wrought with golden braid,<br>
 
 And a row of pearls, moreover. Unto her Stevan said:<br>
 
  “God’s aid be with thee, my sister! And where hast thou seen the fight?<br>
 
 <p>

 Where found’st thou the cap? Give unto me the silken cap so white,<br>
 
 That I may find whose is the cap, what marshal’s it may be,<br>
 
 And be lucky upon my journey. And I will keep faith with thee.”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td> Answered the Maid of Kósovo: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Thou lord of kingly mien,</td></tr></table>
 
 My mother roused me at daybreak; at no fight have I been.<br>
 
 I would draw water in Sítnitsa. He had overflowed his banks;<br>
 
 And, brother, he beareth the horses and the heroes in their ranks,<br>
 
 And turbans, and Turkish fezes, and the Serb caps white as milk.<br>
 
 I plunged into the Sítnitsa, and seized the cap of silk,<br>
 
 And I bear to my little brother the fair cap silken and white,<br>
 
 For I am young, and the feathers are pleasant in my sight.”<br>
 
  She gave the cap to the marshal; I wot he knew it well!<br>
 
 He smote himself, and the sad tears down from his cheeks they fell.<br>
 
 The golden buckle on his sleeve rent the satin on his knee:<br>
 
 “Grief unto God! The prince’s curse hath fallen upon me!”<br>
 
 <p>

 He gave her the cap, and royally out of his pouch he told<br>
 
 In the hand of the Maid of Kósovo three ducats of yellow gold:<br>
 
  “Take, sister! I go to Kósovo and the battle on the plain.<br>
 
 By Christ, I will give thee a better gift, if I come back again!<br>
 
 But if I die in the fight thereby, aye keep my gift in mind.”<br>
 
  They spurred the steeds and hard away they galloped like the wind;<br>
 
 They forded the flood of Sítnitsa, to the tsar’s camp they drew.<br>
 
 Three Turkish pashas Stevan smote down and overthrew;<br>
 
 Against the fourth was he storming, but the Turks o’erwhelmed him then.<br>
 
 With him died Váistina and twelve thousand of his men.<br>
 
 There did the folly of the Serbs make as of nothing worth<br>
 
 The glory of Tsar Lazar and the Kingdom of the Earth.<br>
