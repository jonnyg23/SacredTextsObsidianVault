 <h2 align="center">MARKO DRINKS WINE IN RAMAZÁN</h2>
 
 T<small>HERE</small> was an edict sent abroad by the Tsar Suleymán<br>
 
 That none should drink the yellow wine in the month of Ramazán,<br>
 
 That none should wear green tunics, nor silver-inlaid dirks,<br>
 
 And that none should dance, moreover, with the women of the Turks.<br>
 
 But Marko dances among them, and inlaid with silver wan<br>
 
 Is his blade, and green is his tunic, and he tipples in Ramazán.<br>
 
 And the Turkish priests and pilgrims, he maketh them drink likewise.<br>
 
 And the Turks go to the palace unto Suleymán’s assize:<br>
 
  “Father and mother of us an art thou, Tsar Suleymán.<br>
 
 Saith not thine edict: none shall drink liquor in Ramazán;<br>
 
 And that none shall wear green tunics, nor silver-inlaid dirks;<br>
 
 And that none shall dance, moreover, with the women of the Turks?<br>
 
 Now Marko dances among them; and inlaid with silver wan<br>
 
 Is his blade; and green is his tunic; and he tipples in Ramazán.<br>
 
 Wine he may drink and welcome, if it seem good in his eyes,<br>
 
 <p>

 But the Turkish priests and pilgrirns, he maketh them drink likewise.”<br>
 
  When the tsar heard their story, he summoned his heralds twain:<br>
 
 “Go, heralds, to Prince Marko, bid him come hither amain.”<br>
 
 Forth issued the two heralds; upon their way they went,<br>
 
 And they found Prince Marko drinking in the shadow of his tent.<br>
 
 And a cup that held twelve measures is ready to his hand.<br>
 
 The heralds twain gave unto him the word of the tsar’s command:<br>
 
  “Dost thou then hear, Prince Marko? It is good in the tsar’s eyes<br>
 
 That thou come to his council, and the court of his assize.”<br>
 
  O, angry was Prince Marko! He snatched the goblet up,<br>
 
 And he smote the tsars two heralds in his anger, with the cup.<br>
 
 The cup rang and the head rang; the blood and wine ran free.<br>
 
 And Marko went to the tsars assize, and sat at the tsar’s right knee.<br>
 
 And the black cap of sable fur he pulled across his face,<br>
 
 And he laid his saber across his breast, and his hand upon his mace:<br>
 
  “My foster child, Prince Marko,” said the Tsar Suleymán,<br>

 Mine edict saith: none shall drink wine in the month of Ramazán;<br>
 
 And none shall wear green tunics, nor silver-inlaid dirks,<br>
 
 And none shall dance, moreover, with the women of the Turks.<br>
 
 Now here be worthy Moslems that have spoken evilly.<br>
 
 Alas, my poor son Marko, I wot they have slandered thee!<br>
 
 That thou dancest with Turkish matrons, and inlaid with silver wan<br>
 
 Is thy blade; and green is thy tunic; and thou tipplest in Ramazán;<br>
 
 And the Turkish priests and pilgrims, thou makest them drink likewise!<br>
 
 Now wherefore pullest thou, my son, thy cap across thine eyes?<br>
 
 Why is thy mace beside thee, and thy saber across thy breast?”<br>
 
  And forthwith strong Prince Marko Tsar Suleymán addressed:<br>
 
  “O thou, my foster father, the great Tsar Suleymán,<br>
 
 It is permitted of my faith to drink in Ramazán.<br>
 
 And for the priests and pilgrims, my honor would be gone,<br>
 
 If they should look upon me, and I should drink alone.<br>
 
 If I wear a good green tunic, I am young; it becomes my youth.<br>

 If I gird an inlaid saber, I paid my money in sooth,<br>
 
 If I dance with the Turkish women, O tsar, I am yet unwed,<br>
 
 And once, O tsar, a woman had come not to thy bed,<br>
 
 If I pull my cap on my forehead, it burns, for I speak with the tsar,<br>
 
 And for the freeing of my mace, and drawing the scimitar,<br>
 
 O tsar, in my heart I fear me that battle is hard at hand:<br>
 
 It is ill in battle the nearest to Marko, the Prince, to stand,”<br>
 
  The tsar looked in all quarters another man to see,<br>
 
 But nearer to Prince Marko there was no man than he;<br>
 
 Nearest was the Tsar Suleymán. He drew back in the hall,<br>
 
 But Marko followed onward, and drove him to the wall,<br>
 
 From his pouch drew Tsar Suleymán an hundred ducats fine,<br>
 
 And gave them to Marko, saying: “Marko, go drink the wine.”<br>
