 <h2 align="center">PRINCE MARKO’S PLOWING</h2>
 
 W<small>ITH</small> his mother, Yévrosima, his thirst did Marko slake<br>
 
 On the red wine. When they had drunk, to him his mother spake:<br>
 
  “O thou, Prince Marko, prithee cease from the ravage and the raid;<br>
 
 Never on earth is evil with a good deed repaid.<br>
 
 Weary is thy mother of washing from thy shirts the crimson stain.<br>
 
 But do thou now yoke ox to plow, and plow the hill and the plain.<br>
 
 Sow thou the white wheat, little son, that thou and I may sup.”<br>
 
  Marko harkened his mother, and he yoked the oxen up;<br>
 
 He plows not the hill, nor the valley; but he plows the tsar’s highway.<br>
 
 Some janissaries came thereby; three packs of gold had they:<br>
 
  “Plow not the tsar his highway, Prince Marko,” said they then.<br>
 
  “Ye Turks, mar not my plowing!” he answered them again.<br>
 
  “Plow not the tsar his highway, Prince Marko,” they said anew.<br>
 
  “Ye Turks, mar not my plowing!” he answered thereunto.<br>
 
  But Marko was vext; in anger he lifted ox and plow,<br>

 And the Turkish janissaries he slew thero at a blow,<br>
 
 And their three packs of treasure to his mother he bore away:<br>
 
  “Lo, mother, what my plowing hath won for thee to-day!”<br>
