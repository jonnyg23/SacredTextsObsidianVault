 <h2 align="center">THE BUILDING OF RAVÁNITSA</h2>
 
 To celebrate the holy tide, Tsar Lazarus is gone<br>
 
 To Krúshevats, the fortress of many-colored stone;<br>
 
 To the birthfeast of St. Amos he summons all the lords<br>
 
 By letter and salutation that with their rank accords.<br>
 
 And all the lords of Servia were gathered at that place.<br>
 
 He set them at the tables, by greatness and by grace.<br>
 
 At the head of the good table the good Tsar Lazar sat;<br>
 
 The lords were set beside him to drink the wine thereat;<br>
 
 And they spake of all good tidings what time the wine ran free.<br>
 
  Tsáritsa Mílitsa stepped forth, and through the hall came she.<br>
 
 Girded was she with girdles nine, nine chains her neck did fold,<br>
 
 Nine pendants hung about her brows from the coronet of gold,<br>
 
 And the three summits of the crown were set with a precious stone<br>
 
 That shone by night as broad and bright as in the day the sun.<br>
 
 <table><tr><td>And she spoke to the glorious Lazarus: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Abashed am I to-day</td></tr></table>

 Only to look on thee, Lazarus; and more this word to say—<br>
 
 I cannot help it, I must speak forth. Némanya’s sons of old,<br>
 
 They were our tsars in word and deed, and all their days are told.<br>
 
 They heaped not treasure up in hills, but to God reared many a fane;<br>
 
 They builded their good monasteries on the mountain and the plain;<br>
 
 They reared o’er Jákovitsa Déchani on the height,<br>
 
 The Patriarch’s Place at level Pech,<a name="page_28_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_28_note_1"><font size="1">1</font></a> and in Drénitsa the white<br>
 
 Did they raise the Devich; near Pazar St. Peter’s Church they set,<br>
 
 And the great Pillars of St. George on the mount, higher yet;<br>
 
 They builded Sópochani over the Rashka cold,<br>
 
 And the Cathedral of St. Anne they wrought in Vlah the Old;<br>
 
 Studénitsa ’neath Brivenik; ’neath Yádovnik, St. Paul;<br>
 
 O’er Káranovats the fair church that Zhicha men do call.<br>
 
 The Chapel of Good Friday on Prizrend did they bestow;<br>
 
 And they reared Gráchanitsa on level Kósovo.<br>
 
 All these are their foundations. In their place thou reignest now;<br>
 
 <p>

 No churches hast thou founded, yet a treasure of gold hast thou.<br>
 
 The treasure availeth nothing to help us or to heal;<br>
 
 Neither for soul or body will treasure work our weal.”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td> Then rose up Lazar the glorious: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“My great lords, harken ye</td></tr></table>
 
 What saith my queen, that nowhere a church builded have we!<br>
 
 Ravánitsa in Résava by the Ravan will I rear,<br>
 
 For treasure in my treasuries whate’er I need is here.<br>
 
 Leaden shall be the corner stones, and the walls of silver white;<br>
 
 I will cover the walls of it with the gold burnished bright.<br>
 
 And moreover, by God’s mercy, shall pearls be set thereon,<br>
 
 And the gateways of the chapels shall glow with precious stone.”<br>
 
  The Servian lords rose lightly; they bowed down one and all:<br>
 
 “Build for the sake of thine own soul and the health of Stevan the Tall.”<a name="page_29_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_29_note_1"><font size="1">1</font></a><br>
 
  But Milosh Óbilich sat there at the table foot to dine,<br>
 
 <p>

 <a name="page_30"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 30</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 And naught he said; and Lazar saw, and pledged him in the wine:<br>
 
  “Hail to thee, Milosh the voývoda! What then to me wilt thou say?<br>
 
 For I think to build to our Lord God a mighty church this day.”<br>
 
  Milosh rose up and doffed the cap with the plumes and sable fine,<br>
 
 And he made obeisance to the tsar, and they gave him the cup of wine.<br>
 
 Milosh took up the golden cup, and gave his health again:<br>
 
  “Glory to thee, prince, for thy speech, but for building of the fane—<br>
 
 This is no time for building. In faith, it cannot be!<br>
 
 My lord, but look in the ancient book what it shall say to thee.<br>
 
 The last hour is upon us; swift it cometh apace.<br>
 
 The Turks will take the kingdom and rule it in our place.<br>
 
 They will sack church and convent, and Ravánitsa likewise.<br>
 
 The foundations of Ravánitsa, they will dig them for a prize,<br>
 
 And melt them into cannon balls, to beat and batter down<br>
 
 The bulwarks of our churches and the rampart of the town.<br>
 
 For trappings the whitesilver walls shall be molten in the flames;<br>
 
 <p>

 They will overthrow the church roof for necklets for their dames;<br>
 
 For these same necklaces, I wot, they will wrench away the pearls;<br>
 
 For their sword hilts will they take the gems, and for rings for Turkish girls.<br>
 
 But hark to me, Tsar Lazar! Let us quarry out the stone<br>
 
 And build a church of marble. For the Turks will seize the throne,<br>
 
 And our church shall serve forever, unto God’s Judgment Day!<br>
 
 There is no profit in the stone, to carry it away.”<br>
 
  Then spake the great Tsar Lazarus, when he that speech had heard:<br>
 
 “Now glory to thee, Milosh, for truth is in thy word!”<br>
