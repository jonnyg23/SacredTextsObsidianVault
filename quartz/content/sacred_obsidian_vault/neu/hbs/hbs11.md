 <h2 align="center">FRAGMENTS OF KÓSOVO BALLADS</h2>
 
 <h3 align="center">I</h3>
 
 M<small>URAD</small> the tsar hath come in war down upon Kósovo;<br>
 
 He sent a letter to Krúshevats that the tsar his will might know:<br>
 
  “Ho, Lazar, lord of Servia, with sense it scarce accords,<br>
 
 That there should be one empery ’neath the power of two lords,<br>
 
 One rayah that pays double tax! We cannot both rule here!<br>
 
 So render me up your city keys and the taxes for seven year.<br>
 
 But if thou wilt not send them, abide at Kósovo,<br>
 
 That to our hand we may sunder the land with a keen saber blow.”<br>
 
  When the fine-written letter Tsar Lazarus had read,<br>
 
 He looked upon the letter and bitter tears he shed.<br>

 Bitter was the tsar’s curse to hear; aye! and a word of woe:<br>
 
  “Who comes not to the battle with me at Kósovo,<br>
 
 Let nothing grow beneath his hand in the field that he shall till;<br>
 
 Let not the white wheat spring in the field, nor the vine shoot on the hill!”<br>

 Lazar, the Tsar of Servia, holds his high holiday.<br>
 
 In the secret place, in Krúshevats, with all his lords he lay.<br>
 
 All of the lords and lordings were come with him to dine:<br>
 
 At his right hand sat Yug Bogdan and Yug’s strong children nine;<br>
 
 On his left sat Vuk Bránkovich; at the far end of the board,<br>
 
 With two more Servian voývodas, was Milosh the young lord;<br>
 
 Ivan Kósanchich was the one, the other of the twain<br>
 
 Was Milan Tóplitsa. And the tsar arose a health to drain<br>
 
 Unto the Servian nobles; he lifted the beaker up:<br>
 
  “O voývodas and captains, to whom shall I pledge this cup?<br>
 
 If I pledge it unto the oldest, to Yug shall I drink this hour;<br>
 
 I shall pledge it to Vuk Bránkovich, if I drink because of power;<br>
 
 If I pledge to whomsoever is dear to me and mine,<br>
 
 I’ll drink to my good brethren, Yug Bogdan’s children nine;<br>
 
 For beauty to Ivan Kósanchich, and to Milan for his height;<br>
 
 But unto Milosh Óbilich for the glory of his might.<br>
 
 To none other will I drink it, while I have strength and breath:<br>

 A health unto Milosh Obilich, and faith and broken faith!<br>
 
 Faith first and treason to follow! To-morrow at Kósovo<br>
 
 Thou shalt betray me, and after to the tsar of the Turks shalt thou go.<br>
 
 Hail to thee, and a health to thee, and the cup’s delight be thine!<br>
 
 Rise up, Milosh the voývoda, and lightly drink the wine!”<br>
 
  Milosh rose swiftly to his feet, and bowed to the black earth:<br>
 
  “Praise to thee, Lazar the glorious, and a greeting to thy worth!<br>
 
 Praise for thy gift and greeting, but for thy speech no praise!<br>
 
 Since I was never a traitor, by my faith, in all my days,<br>
 
 Nor ever will work treason. But at Kósovo to-morn<br>
 
 Belike for the Cross of Christ and his Faith shall I be overborne.<br>
 
 But treachery is at thy knee, and drinketh before thy face;<br>
 
 There sits the traitor Bránkovich, of the accursèd race.<br>
 
 To-morrow on St. Vitus’ day, on the field of Kósovo,<br>
 
 Who of us twain is true or false, all men shall clearly know.<a name="page_71_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_71_note_1"><font size="1">1</font></a><br>

 An God me speed, will I ride indeed to Kósovo in the dawn,<br>
 
 To slash the throat of Murad the tsar and set my foot thereon.<br>
 
 An God give me good fortune, safely returning here,<br>
 
 I will lay hand on Bránkovich, and bind him to this spear,<br>
 
 As flax on the long distaff is bound by a woman’s hand,<br>
 
 And to and fro in Kósovo will I bear him through the land.”<br>

 “Ho, brother Ivan Kósanchich, hast thou spied the Turks’ array?<br>
 
 Have the Turks a mighty army? Can we beat them in the fray?”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td> Quoth Ivan: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Milosh Óbilich, my own good brother dear,</td></tr></table>
 
 I have spied the Turkish army, and a great host have they here.<br>
 
 Should all of us be changed to salt, we scarce should salt their meat.<br>
 
 Full fifteen days throughout their host have I walked with nimble feet,<br>
 
 Nor came on end or number, howsoever I might march;<br>
 
 From the marble to the maple, thence to Sázliya of the arch,<br>
 
 From the arched bridge to Zvechan the whole land have they ta’en;<br>
 
 From Zvechan through Chechan to the wood they seized the mount amain.<br>
 
 Ranks of horses and heroes, spears like a mountain wall,<br>
 
 And like the clouds of heaven are their banners over all;<br>
 
 And like the snows from heaven are their tents upon the plain;<br>
 
 And should a storm rise o’er them, on the earth it would not rain,<br>
 
 <p>

 <a name="page_74"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 74</font></a>

 But on horses and on heroes would the rain fall from on high.<br>
 
 The tsar took Lab and Sítnitsa and Mazgit field thereby.”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td> Still Milosh Óbilich questions him: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Ivan, brother in war,</td></tr></table>
 
 Tell me where lieth, brother, the tent of Murad the tsar;<br>
 
 For unto the Tsar Lazarus my word is given and gone,<br>
 
 That I would slash Tsar Murad’s throat and set my foot thereon.”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td> But Ivan answers him lightly: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Brother, a fool art thou!</td></tr></table>
 
 Where in the center of the camp Tsar Murad lieth now,<br>
 
 Wert thou a wingèd goshawk from out high heaven sped,<br>
 
 Thou couldst not in thine anger hurt a hair upon his head.”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td> Then Milosh speaketh to Ivan: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Ivan, my brother dear,</td></tr></table>
 
 Speak not thus to Tsar Lazarus, lest he and the host should fear;<br>
 
 But unto the Tsar Lazarus thus and thus shalt thou say:<br>
 
  “ ‘Strong are the Turks, but we, mayhap, will shake them in the fray,<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 75------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_75"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 75</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 And lightly overcome them, for no host of battle they are,<br>
 
 But priests and pilgrims and merchants, and knaves that know not war,<br>
 
 That are come abroad together to eat Tsar Murad’s bread.<br>
 
 And for the royal army, the half are well-nigh dead<br>
 
 From the grievous ill of heartache, that is a bitter pain,<br>
 
 And the good steeds of that army are glandered on the plain.’ ”<br>

 “Who is the great hero that lifted once his hand,<br>
 
 And sundered well twelve Turkish heads with the edges of the brand?”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td> “That is the brave Ban Strahin.” </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“What hero cometh here,</td></tr></table>
 
 That spitteth the Moslems two and two on the edges of his spear,<br>
 
 And driveth them before him to Sítnitsa’s gray tide?”<br>
 
  “That is Srija the champion, whom men call the Angry-Eyed.”<br>
 
  “What hero on a white steed bears the flag of the cross in his hands,<br>
 
 And all along he harries the flying Turks in bands,<br>
 
 And chases them in his anger to Sítnitsa the flood?”<br>
 
  “That is Boshko the captain, of old Yug Bogdan’s blood.”<br>
