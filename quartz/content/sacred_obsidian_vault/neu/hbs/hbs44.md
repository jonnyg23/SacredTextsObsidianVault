 <h2 align="center">MUYO AND ALIYA</h2>
 
 M<small>UYO</small> and Áliya were brothers, and nobly did they live;<br>
 
 Their very steeds and armor to each other would they give.<br>
 
 They came unto a turbid lake, and a duck went swimming by,<br>
 
 With golden wings; and Muyo let his gray falcon fly,<br>
 
 And Áliya a tame lanneret. Them happed the duck to slay.<br>
 
 Said Muyo: “The falcon took it.” But Áliya said, “Nay,<br>
 
 <table><tr><td>’Twas the lanneret.” </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Then was Muyo sore cast down in that place.</td></tr></table>
 
 They seated them ’neath a green fir to drink the wine apace,<br>
 
 And sleep and the wine o’ercame them. They were seen of three vilas<a name="page_254_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_254_note_1"><font size="1">1</font></a> white;<br>
 
 <table><tr><td>Then said the oldest: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Here be now two noble heroes of fight.</td></tr></table>
 
 I will give an hundred sequins to whomsoever of you<br>
 
 <table><tr><td>Shall make the heroes quarrel.” </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Then forth the youngest flew</td></tr></table>

 On her white wings, and settled on the ground by Muyo’s head;<br>
 
 And over face and forehead the bitter tears she shed.<br>
 
 Burned Muyo’s face; as he were mad, he leaped at his brother’s side.<br>
 
 When he looked, he saw the damsel; to his brother then he cried:<br>
 
 “Arise now, Áliya, my brother! Let us hasten home away.”<br>
 
 Up leaped the Turk: “Nay, brother, now may a plague thee slay!<br>
 
 Now hast thou got two damsels, but there is none for me.”<a name="page_255_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_255_note_1"><font size="1">1</font></a><br>
 
  Muyo was grieved; forth from his belt he wrenched the dagger free,<br>
 
 And there smote Áliya to the heart. He fell on the green grass;<br>
 
 But Muyo seized the milk-white steed, and threw behind the lass;<br>
 
 And unto his own homestead o’er the mountain did he ride.<br>
 
 Neighed the black steed of Áliya, and the wounded hero cried:<br>
 
  “O Muyo, brother and kinsman! turn back upon the way;<br>
 
 Take the black steed, lest masterless on the mountain side it neigh—<br>

 But thy fame shall be forever, as though thou hadst blinded thine eyes.”<br>
 
  Muyo turned back unto him, and took the steed likewise,<br>
 
 And threw the girl thereon. Across the mountains did they pass;<br>
 
 And when about the middle of the journey home he was,<br>
 
 He came upon a raven with the right wing gone from the side;<br>
 
 And unto the black raven he raised his voice and cried:<br>
 
 “Ho, raven! Without the black right wing, prithee how dost thou fare?”<br>
 
 And with a wail the raven gave answer to him there:<br>
 
  “Without my wing is it with me as without a brother to be;<br>
 
 As without Áliya, Muyo, is it even now with thee.”<br>
 
  Said the Turk to himself: “Ah, Muyo, alas for thy might this day!<br>
 
 If even the birds reproach me, what will my brethren say?”<br>
 
  Said the vila to him: “Muyo, return on thy track again.<br>
 
 Perchance I might heal thy brother; I was once a healer of men.”<br>
 
  Muyo turned back upon the track. When at the lake they were,<br>
 
 He looked behind at the black steed, but the maiden was not there.<br>

 By his friend he knelt, but the spirit had hasted to depart;<br>
 
 When he saw, he drew his dagger and thrust it through his heart.<br>
