 <h2 align="center">STARÍNA NOVAK AND THE BOLD RÁDIVOYE</h2>
 
 S<small>TARÍNA</small> N<small>OVAK</small> drank the wine on Romániya the green hill,<br>
 
 And Rádivoye, his brother, drank with him with a will;<br>
 
 And Grúitsa, Stárina’s son, Rádivoye sat before;<br>
 
 With Grúitsa was Tátomir and thirty hayduks more.<br>
 
 When the hayduks in good fellowship had drunk the liquor cold,<br>
 
 Then spake unto his brother Rádivoye, called the bold:<br>
 
  “Hearest thou, brother Novak? I will leave thee behind me now.<br>
 
 Thou canst not go a-raiding; too grievous old art thou.<br>
 
 Thou dost not love to gallop on the highway any more,<br>
 
 To lie in wait for traders that come from the seashore.”<br>
 
  So spake bold Rádivoye. He leaped from the ground to his feet,<br>
 
 He seized on Breshka by the waist; the thirty followed fleet.<br>
 
 Rado<a name="page_195_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_195_note_1"><font size="1">1</font></a> went over the black mount; ’neath a green fir Novak lay,<br>
 
 With his two young sons. Brave Rado came to a crossing in the way.<br>

 A wretched chance befell him, for Mehmed the Moor rode there;<br>
 
 With thirty heroes and three great packs of treasure the Turks did fare.<br>
 
 When Mehmed saw the hayduks, he shouted to his men.<br>
 
 The champions drew their sabers and rushed on the outlaws then.<br>
 
 They had no chance in that short time their muskets to let drive.<br>
 
 The Turks smote thirty heads off, and Rado seized alive;<br>
 
 They bound his hands behind him; they led him o’er the hill,<br>
 
 With insult, but bold Rado sang to them with a will:<br>
 
  “God slay thee, Mount Romániya! Dost thou breed no hawk in thee?<br>
 
 Flew a flock of doves with a raven before their company;<br>
 
 A white swan led they, and treasure beneath their wings had they.”<br>
 
  Child Grúitsa heard Rado as he sang on the highway.<br>
 
 <table><tr><td>He spake to Starína Novak: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“My father, harken thou,</td></tr></table>
 
 For out on the broad highway is some one singing now,<br>
 
 And speaks of Mount Romániya and the mountain-falcon gray.<br>

 It is like our Uncle Rado. He has gained a treasure this day,<br>
 
 Or else he has fallen on evil. Let us go to give him aid.”<br>
 
  He seized on his Damascus gun and went to the ambuscade<br>
 
 On the tsar’s highway, and after him young Tátomir lightly ran;<br>
 
 And after the children followed Novak the ancient man.<br>
 
 On the highway in the ambuscade, there Novak took his ground;<br>
 
 And beside him his two children. O’er the mountain came a sound,<br>
 
 And presently thirty champions before them did appear,<br>
 
 And every champion carried a hayduk’s head on his spear.<br>
 
 And Mehmed the Moor before him drove the bound Rado still,<br>
 
 And likewise three loads of treasure on the high road over the hill,<br>
 
 Till into the ambuscade he marched with the squadron of his might.<br>
 
 Novak shouted to his children. They fired the muskets light;<br>
 
 Mehmed the Moor they hit in the belt. He did not yell one yell—<br>
 
 Dead was Mehmed the mighty Moor, ere to the ground he fell.<br>
 
 The Moor fell there on the green grass. Stárina Novak sped,<br>

 And swung his saber in the air, and straight cut off his head,<br>
 
 And then he rushed to Rado; from his hand he cut the cord<br>
 
 And gave him the saber of a Moor. Now glory to God the Lord!<br>
 
 They made a rush upon the Turks, they cut them into bands,<br>
 
 And pursued them hither and yonder. Who ’scaped from Rado’s hands<br>
 
 Young Tátomir awaited. From him who got away,<br>
 
 Them awaited child Grúitsa in eagerness to slay;<br>
 
 And them who ’scaped from Grúitsa old Novak waited for.<br>
 
 They slew the thirty champions, and spoiled the Turks in war;<br>
 
 They won in that same hour three packs of treasure fine.<br>
 
 Then sat they down together to drink the yellow wine.<br>
 
  Said Novak: “Tell me truly, Rado, my brother bold,<br>
 
 Which is better—thirty hayduks, or Starína Novak the old?”<br>
 
  To him said Rado: “My brother, the thirty better were they—<br>
 
 The good friends; but thy fortune they had it not this day.”<br>
 
  <br>
 
  It is ill for the hero who hears not what his elders have to say.<br>
