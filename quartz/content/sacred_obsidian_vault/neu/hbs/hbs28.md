 <h2 align="center">PRINCE MARKO AND THE DAUGHTER OF THE MOORISH KING</h2>
 
 <table><tr><td>H<small>IS</small> mother asks Prince Marko: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Marko, my little son,</td></tr></table>
 
 So many monasteries wherefore hast thou begun?<br>
 
 Hast thou sinned before God? Or by good hap hast thou won the gold abroad?”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td> Marko of Prilip answered: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“I will tell in the name of God.</td></tr></table>
 
 Once, when I was in the Moorish land, at dawn to a cistern fair<br>
 
 I went, that Dapple might drink thereof; and behold, at the water there,<br>
 
 Were twelve Moors. Out of my due time I wished to water the steed;<br>
 
 The twelve Moors would not let me, and a battle did we breed.<br>
 
 Thereat I drew the heavy mace, and smote a black Moor down.<br>
 
 We smote against each other, eleven against one.<br>
 
 Two I smote down, and ten of them came furiously at me.<br>
 
 Then nine of them must I abide, for I had stricken three.<br>
 
 The fourth fell; eight were the champions against me that did drive.<br>
 
 But I struck again; on the red ground lay ruddy corpses five.<br>

 I slew the sixth, but was taken by the six that were left alive.<br>
 
 They bound me, and they bore me to the Moorish king along;<br>
 
 And the king of the Moors threw me into the dungeon strong.<br>
 
 Seven years was I in it: when summer was at hand<br>
 
 I knew not, nor when winter had come across the land;<br>
 
 Except that, when in winter the girls the snowballs cast,<br>
 
 Then would they toss a snowball into the dungeon fast;<br>
 
 And then I knew it was winter, as I lay within the tower.<br>
 
 In the summer, they would throw me a sprig of basil flower,<br>
 
 And I knew it was summer. The eighth year in prison that I was,<br>
 
 I wearied not of prison, but of a Moorish lass.<br>
 
 Unto the Moorish Sultan the daughter dear was she;<br>
 
 Night and morn to the window of the tower she summoned me:<br>
 
  “ ‘Marko, poor lad, in the dungeon I prithee rot not here,<br>
 
 But give true pledge thou wilt take me to be thy true love dear,<br>
 
 If I free thee from the dungeon, and thy Dapple from the hold.<br>
 
 Marko, unto thy heart’s desire will I gather ducats of gold.’<br>

  “When I saw that might was against me, and strength compelling me,<br>
 
 I took my cap from off my head, and swore to it on my knee,<br>
 
 <table><tr><td>A firm pledge to the cap I swore: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>‘Thee I will never leave;</td></tr></table>
 
 A firm pledge, and moreover, ne’er will I thee deceive.<br>
 
 E’en the sun is false; he warms not winter as summertide—<br>
 
 Never will I renounce the pledge; thereby will I abide.’<br>
 
  “Then thought the Moorish maiden that unto her I swore.<br>
 
 One night, at fall of darkness, she opened the dungeon door<br>
 
 And led me out of the dungeon, and Dapple from the hold,<br>
 
 And a better horse for herself. On both were holsters full of gold;<br>
 
 She brought a silver-hilted sword. On the horses we laid hand,<br>
 
 And forthwith galloped onward over the Moorish land.<br>
 
 When the dawn shone, my mother, I sat me down to rest;<br>
 
 And the Moorish maid, with her black arms she clasped me to her breast.<br>
 
 When I looked on her, my mother, she was black and her teeth were white,<br>

 </p>
 
 And it was a thing unpleasing and dreadful in my sight.<br>
 
 The silver-hilted saber forth from the sheath I drew;<br>
 
 I smote her under her silken belt; the blade cut through and through.<br>
 
 I seized on Dapple; still the head of the Moorish maid spake on:<br>
 
 ‘My brother Marko, wretched lad, leave me not here alone.’<br>
 
 Then, mother, I sinned in the sight of God, but gained much gold and gear,<br>
 
 Whereby the monasteries and churches fair I rear.”<br>
