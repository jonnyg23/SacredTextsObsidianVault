 <h2 align="center">PRINCE MARKO AND MINA OF KOSTUR</h2>
 
 P<small>RINCE</small> M<small>ARKO</small> and his mother had sat them down to dine;<br>
 
 On the dry bread they feasted, and they drank the yellow wine.<br>
 
 And unto the prince Marko came letters three that day:<br>
 
 One was from Bajazét the tsar, in white Stamboul that lay;<br>
 
 One from the town of Budim, from the king thereof had come;<br>
 
 And one from Yanko the voývoda, in Sibin that had his home.<br>
 
 The letter from Stamboul city, that was written of the tsar,<br>
 
 To the army summons Marko for the keen Moorish war.<br>
 
 In the letter out of Budim, the second of the three,<br>
 
 The king with the wooers bids him that the groomsman he may be,<br>
 
 That the king may lightly marry the queen of whom he is fain.<br>
 
 The letter from Sibin the city, it beareth a message plain,<br>
 
 That as godfather he shall christen the children of Yanko twain.<br>
 
 <table><tr><td>Marko speaks to his mother: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“My mother, old art thou;</td></tr></table>
 
 Council me, mother, shall I go to the tsar’s army now?<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 153------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_153"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 153</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 Shall I go among the wooers, to marry the king amain?<br>
 
 Or unto Yanko of Sibin, to christen his children twain?”<br>
 
  His mother speaketh to Marko: “My little son,” saith she,<br>
 
 “A man goes unto the wooers because of jollity;<br>
 
 As a godfather a man goes forth because of the law of God;<br>
 
 But a man goes to the army because of the fear of the rod.<br>
 
 Go, my son, to the army, for God will hold his hand;<br>
 
 But the Turks, an thou come not thither, they will not understand.”<br>
 
  Marko obeyed his mother. To the host he marched away;<br>
 
 He took Golúban the servant; to his mother did he say:<br>
 
  “Hear, mother! Of my fortress do thou early shut the gate,<br>
 
 And when ariseth the morning, do thou throw it open late;<br>
 
 Since with Mina accurst of Kostur at odds am I, and I fear,<br>
 
 Mother, that my white houses the rogue will plunder here.”<br>
 
  Marko to the tsar’s army with Golúban the servant went.<br>
 
 On the third evening of the march, when they had pitched the tent,<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 154------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_154"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 154</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 Marko supped, and Golúban served out the yellow wine.<br>
 
 Marko took up the goblet, and slumber fell on his eyne;<br>
 
 He dropped the cup on the table, but the wine spilled not on the board.<br>
 
 Golúban the servant waketh him; “Prince Marko,” he saith, “my lord,<br>
 
 Ere this hast thou gone to the army, but thou hast not slumbered so deep,<br>
 
 <table><tr><td>Nor dropped the cup from thy fingers.” </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>But Marko started from sleep,</td></tr></table>
 
 <table><tr><td>And said: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Golúban, my servant, thou art faithful, as I deem.</td></tr></table>
 
 I closed mine eyes for a little, and I dreamed a wondrous dream.<br>
 
 Exceeding strange was the dream, and exceeding strange the hour.<br>
 
 A tuft of mist blew outward from Kostur the white tower:<br>
 
 The mist enveloped Prilip; in the white mist Mina came.<br>
 
 He will plunder my white houses and burn them with the flame;<br>
 
 Over my mother’s body will he trample with the steed;<br>
 
 My faithful bride upon that tide a captive will he lead;<br>
 
 My horses from the stables, he will drive them all away;<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 155------------------------>

 </p>
 
 The money in my treasury he will carry off that day.”<br>
 
  To Marko said Golúban: “Fear not, Prince Marko. In sooth,<br>
 
 Good heroes ever dreamed good dreams. Dreams lie, but God is truth.”<br>
 
  When they were come to Tsárigrad,<a name="page_155_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_155_note_1"><font size="1">1</font></a> the tsar sent forth his host,<br>
 
 Over the blue sea went they forth to the fierce Moorish coast;<br>
 
 And four and forty cities have they ta’en over sea.<br>
 
 They came under Kara Okan, and years they fought there three;<br>
 
 Okan they smote, and never could they storm it in the war.<br>
 
 Marko smote down the Moorish chiefs and bore their heads to the tsar.<br>
 
 The tsar gave bakshish to Marko, and wroth the Turks did it make;<br>
 
 And they came in anger to the tsar, and unto him they spake:<br>
 
  “Tsar Bajazét, this Marko, no hero at all is he;<br>
 
 He cleaveth and bringeth for bakshish the heads of the slain to thee.”<br>
 
  Marko heard it, and forthwith to the great tsar did he pray:<br>
 
  “My father by adoption, to-morrow is the day<br>
 
 Of St. George, my own good patron, and let me, tsar, withdraw<br>
 
 To hold my patron’s festival by custom and by law;<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 156------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_156"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 156</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 And Alil Aga, my brother sworn, likewise do thou release,<br>
 
 That he and I together may drink the wine in peace.”<br>
 
  The tsar sent forth Prince Marko, for naught else could he do,<br>
 
 To hold his patron’s festival, and released his brother too.<br>
 
 And into the green forest forthwith Prince Marko sped,<br>
 
 Nor far from the tsar’s army his white pavilion spread;<br>
 
 To tipple on dark liquor he sat him on the grass,<br>
 
 And with him Alil Aga, his brother sworn that was.<br>
 
 And the Moorish watch discovered, when the fair daybreak shone,<br>
 
 How forth from the tsar’s army Marko the Prince was gone.<br>
 
 Then shouted all the Moorish watch: “O furious Moors, set on!<br>
 
 The hero on the great gray steed—the terrible is gone!”<br>
 
 The Moors set on, and of the host slew thirty thousand men;<br>
 
 And the tsar wrote a letter unto Prince Marko then:<br>
 
  “My good son by adoption, come quickly here again,<br>
 
 For thirty thousand men of mine have been in battle slain!”<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 157------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_157"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 157</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
  But Marko said: “How then may I come quickly, father mine?<br>
 
 For as yet I have not drunken my fill of the yellow wine,<br>
 
 And much less have I started my holiday to hold.”<br>
 
  And lo, upon the morrow, when broke the morning cold,<br>
 
 Then shouted all the Moorish watch: “O furious Moors, set on!<br>
 
 The hero on the great gray steed—the terrible is gone!”<br>
 
 The Moors set on, and of the host slew sixty thousand men;<br>
 
 Once more the great Tsar Bajazét wrote to Prince Marko then:<br>
 
  “My good son by adoption, come quickly here again,<br>
 
 For sixty thousand men of mine have been in battle slain!”<br>
 
  But Marko said: “My father, a little must thou wait;<br>
 
 I have not yet regaled my friends as well befits their state.”<br>
 
  On the third day shouted the Moorish watch: “O furious Moors, set on!<br>
 
 The hero on the great gray steed—the terrible is gone!”<br>
 
 The Moors set on, and slaughtered an hundred thousand men;<br>
 
 And the tsar wrote a letter unto Prince Marko then:<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 158------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_158"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 158</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
  “Before God for my foster child thee, Marko, will I own;<br>
 
 Come very quickly, for the Moors my camp have overthrown!”<br>
 
  Marko mounted on Dapple, he rode to the tsar’s array;<br>
 
 When day broke, the two armies they clashed in the mêlée.<br>
 
 When the Moorish watch saw Marko, they cried: “Ye Moors, begone!<br>
 
 The hero on the great gray steed—the terrible, comes on!”<br>
 
 Marko smote on the Moorish host; three ways their host he drave.<br>
 
 He slashed throughout one army with the edges of the glaive,<br>
 
 The second of the armies on Dapple he trampled o’er<br>
 
 And herded the third before the tsar. But Marko was wounded sore;<br>
 
 Seventy wounds at the Moors’ hands on Marko’s body there are.<br>
 
 On the tsar’s breast falleth Marko, and to him saith the tsar:<br>
 
  “Marko, my good foster child, by thy wounds now art thou slain?<br>
 
 Can the doctors with their wrappings recover thee again?”<br>
 
  Prince Marko then made answer: “No deadly wounds they are,<br>
 
 And I deem that I shall recover.” And thereupon the tsar<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 159------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_159"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 159</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 Thrust hand into pouch and to him a thousand ducats gave,<br>
 
 That the Prince Marko might go forth his wounds to heal and lave;<br>
 
 And the tsar sends forth two faithful lads, lest Marko the Prince should die.<br>
 
 But Marko sought not a doctor; from inn to inn did he hie,<br>
 
 And ever sought Prince Marko where the best wine was to drain.<br>
 
 Scarce had he drunk his fill thereof, when his wounds were healed again.<br>
 
  But a fine-written letter to the Prince Marko came,<br>
 
 That his houses all were plundered and ravaged with the flame,<br>
 
 And the body of his mother trampled over by the steed,<br>
 
 And his faithful wife a captive his enemy did lead.<br>
 
 Then Marko mourned and to the tsar, his foster father, said:<br>
 
  “My foster father, my white house is ravaged in the raid;<br>
 
 My faithful bride upon this tide a captive do they lead;<br>
 
 Over my mother’s body have they trampled with the steed;<br>
 
 The money in my treasury is stolen from me this day:<br>
 
 Mina of Kostur, he it was who carried it away.”<br>

 If these thine houses have been burned, I will build thee better here;<br>
 
 Beside my houses and like to mine shall they be built for thee.<br>

 And thou shalt gather treasure. If thy wife is led away,<br>
 
 I will give thee a better lady upon the wedding day.”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td> Said Marko: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“My foster father, glory to thee again!</td></tr></table>
 
 When thou buildest the houses for me, orphans will curse me then,<br>
 
 Saying: ‘This rascal Marko, his houses were burned of late;<br>

 If thou makest me farmer of taxes, till I bind poor, needy men,<br>
 
 I cannot gather the taxes, and orphans will curse me then,<br>
 
 Saying: ‘This rascal Marko, what gold he had of late<br>
 
 Was stolen; what he hath presently, may it too be desolate!’<br>
 
 To another how wilt thou wed me, while yet my wife doth live?—<br>
 
 Three hundred janissaries I prithee to me give;<br>
 
 <p>

 </p>
 
 Forge for them crooked pruning hooks and of slender hoes no lack;<br>
 
 And to white Kostur will I go, if perchance I may win her back.”<br>
 
  Three hundred janissaries were his at the tsar’s command;<br>
 
 The tsar forged crooked pruning hooks and slender hoes to their hand.<br>
 
 To the three hundred Marko his counsel gave aright:<br>
 
  “Go, my three hundred brethren; go now to Kostur the white.<br>
 
 When ye are come to Kostur, the Greeks will be merry thus:<br>
 
 ‘Here are laborers; cheap enow will they tend our vines for us!’<br>
 
 But do ye naught, my brethren. Abide in Kostur the town;<br>
 
 Drink the clear wine and brandy, till thither I come down.”<br>
 
  The three hundred janissaries they went to Kostur the white,<br>
 
 But Marko to Mount Athos, unto the holy height;<br>
 
 And there he took communion and moreover did confess<br>
 
 For the blood he had shed, then clad him in a black cáloyer’s<a name="page_161_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_161_note_1"><font size="1">1</font></a> dress;<br>
 
 He let his beard to the girdle grow, and a monk’s hat put on his head.<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 162------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_162"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 162</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 Then he leaped to the back of Dapple, to Kostur the white he sped.<br>
 
 When he came to Mina of Kostur, there Mina sat to dine,<br>
 
 And Marko’s wife served Mina the cups of yellow wine:<br>
 
  “In God’s name, thou black cáloyer,” did Mina to him say,<br>
 
 “Tell me, prithee, where gottest thou the little dapple gray?”<br>
 
 <table><tr><td> Prince Marko said: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Friend Mina, by the true God do I swear,</td></tr></table>
 
 In the fierce Moorish country, with the tsar’s host was I there.<br>
 
 There was a fool, Prince Marko, that dying there I saw,<br>
 
 And I buried him according to our custom and our law.<br>
 
 A gift for his soul’s salvation they gave this steed to me.”<br>
 
  When Mina of Kostur heard it, he leaped up joyfully,<br>
 
 <table><tr><td>And said: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Nine years have I waited until these tidings came!</td></tr></table>
 
 For Marko’s house have I plundered and ravaged with the flame;<br>
 
 His faithful wife have I made a slave, but I would not break her vow,<br>
 
 Black priest, till Marko perished, and thou shalt marry me now!”<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 163------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_163"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 163</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
  Up Marko took the holy book, and thereupon did wed<br>
 
 Mina unto the woman he had ta’en to his own bed.<br>
 
 Then sat they down to speak fair words and drink the yellow wine.<br>
 
 <table><tr><td> Said Mina: </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>“Hearest thou, Yélitsa, O heart and soul of mine?</td></tr></table>
 
 Till now wast thou Marko’s lady; henceforth thou art Mina’s wife!<br>
 
 Go now to the treasure house below, I prithee, soul of my life,<br>
 
 And bring three cups of ducats to give the cáloyer black.”<br>
 
  Yélitsa brought from the treasure three cups of ducats back;<br>
 
 She took not Mina’s money, but Marko’s. A rusty glaive<br>
 
 She brought up with the money, and to the priest she gave:<br>
 
 “Here is for thee, black cáloyer, a gift for Marko’s sake.”<br>
 
 Marko took up the saber, and looked at it, and spake:<br>
 
  “Mina, the lord of Kostur, is it seemly in thine eyes,<br>
 
 To dance here at thy wedding after the monkish wise?”<br>
 
  Quoth Mina of Kostur to him: “Black cáloyer, to thee<br>
 
 Surely it is permitted. Wherefore should it not be?”<br>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 164------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_164"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 164</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
  Marko leaped on his nimble feet twice and thrice him about;<br>
 
 The tower’s foundations trembled as he drew the saber out.<br>
 
 He drew the rusty saber, he swung it left and right;<br>
 
 The head from Mina’s shoulders at one stroke did he smite.<br>
 
 From his white throat he shouted: “Lord Mina’s days are done;<br>
 
 Ho, all my janissaries! my laborers, come on!”<br>
 
 Three hundred janissaries through Mina’s mansions came;<br>
 
 They plundered his white palace and ravaged it with flame.<br>
 
 Marko brought home his faithful wife and Mina’s horde along,<br>
 
 And went unto white Prilip with chanting and with song.<br>
