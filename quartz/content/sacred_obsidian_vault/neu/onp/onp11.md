 <h2 align="center">THE LAY OF HAROLD<br> <small>[HARALDSKVÆTHI <small>OR</small> HRAFNSMÓL]<br> B<small>Y</small> T<small>HÓRBIORN HORNKLOFI</small></small></h2>
 
 <p>N<small>ORWAY</small> enters into the full daylight of recorded history with King Harold, surnamed Fairhair<a name="fr_1"></a><a href="#note_1"><font size="1">1</font></a> (ca. 860-933), the son of Halvdan the Black, a petty king of Southeastern Norway. While still a youth, Harold after a bitter struggle with the independence-loving nobles brought the whole realm under his sway. The final victorious battle, against a coalition of chieftains of the West reinforced by auxiliaries from the British Isles, was a naval action fought in the Hafrs-firth (873), an inlet of southwest Norway. It is celebrated in this lay. After this battle, rather than submit and pay tribute to Harold, many nobles left the land with all their kin and possessions, settling in the Western Isles and, chiefly, in Iceland.</p>
 
 <p> Among the engaging qualities of this masterful ruler must be reckoned his fondness for poetry. We are told in the reliable <i>Egils saga</i> that “of all his followers, he valued most his skalds,”<a name="fr_2"></a><a href="#note_2"><font size="1">2</font></a> thus probably initiating the tradition of court poets that lasted for centuries. In fact, he is said to have been a poet in his own right, like many of his successors. Several of his court poets are named in the sagas and represented by poems. Of Thórbiorn hornklofi’s<a name="fr_3"></a><a href="#note_3"><font size="1">3</font></a> personality we know little, except that he was of high birth and “an old friend of kings, who had always been attached to their courts.” Two longer poems are attributed to him, the G<i>lymdrápa,</i><a name="fr_4"></a><a href="#note_4"><font size="1">4</font></a> a lay apparently descriptive of Harold’s many battles before accomplishing the unification of Norway, thoroughly Skaldic in manner, which exists only in inconsiderable fragments; and the present poem, much simpler in style, which is given no name in the sources. This, the <i>Haraldskvæthi</i>
 
 <!------------------------page 57------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_57"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 57</font></a>
 
 or <i>Hrafnsmól,</i> as it has been called by some editors, is in a most deplorable condition.</p>
 
 <p> As here given<a name="fr_5"></a><a href="#note_5"><font size="1">5</font></a> it is pieced together from fragments found mainly in the large historical work called <i>Fagrskinna,</i><a name="fr_6"></a><a href="#note_6"><font size="1">6</font></a> which contains a history of the Norwegian kings. There is considerable difficulty about the authorship of these portions, some editors considering stanzas 7 to 11, in particular, as a separate poem dealing with the battle in the Hafrs-firth. The remainder, with descriptions of the life at Harold’s court, is probably incomplete.</p>
 
 <p> The structure of the poem is simple. After the usual admonition to the assembled court to lend their ears, the poet tells us what he heard a raven—scavenger of the battle-field—say to a valkyrie who questions him about Harold’s deeds—naturally all warlike ones. For once, the scenes of carnage here described are individualized. There is grim Viking humor, a dramatic tension, a zest in these descriptions which one inevitably associates with a contemporary and participant.<a name="fr_7"></a><a href="#note_7"><font size="1">7</font></a> Upon her further questioning we are given realistic, even coarse-grained, glimpses of Harold’s youth, his many marriages, and his life at court with berserkers, skalds, and jugglers. In all this, the poem is likely to have set the fashion; possibly also in the alternation of meters. The greater part is in sonorous <i>málaháttr,</i> smaller portions also in <i>lióthaháttr</i> and <i>fornyrthislag</i>.</p>

The legend tells that, when rejected by the fair Gytha, as not being the lord of all Norway, he made the vow neither to cut nor comb his hair till he had brought the whole land under his sway, or else died.

 <p><a name="note_42"></a><a href="#fr_42">42</a> <i>I.e.,</i> the hilts, which were wound with silver wire.</p>

 </p>
 
 <p><a name="note_44"></a><a href="#fr_44">44</a> The valkyrie rather falls out of her rôle in asking about Harold’s jesters and jugglers. The raven voices the scorn generally felt, and expressed by the skalds, of the low buffoonery of these foreigners—for such they were generally—who competed with the skalds for the favors of their prince. The meaning of lines 3-5 is much debated. I follow S. Blöndal’s recent suggestions.</p>
