 <h3 align="CENTER">VARIATION OF 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST'</h3>
 <p>We have another version of this tale, which is a little more like its prototype, the "Cupid and Psyche" of Apuleius. In this the monster comes only at night. At first she is horribly frightened at it, but little by little she becomes accustomed to it, and loves it. At last, after having been left alone for some days, a magnificent young man appears to her, a king's son, who had been bewitched into the monster until some one should love him. Of course they marry and are happy.</p>

 <p>In a third version, which was not taken down, the father was a sailor instead of a king.</p>
