 <h3 align="CENTER">JESUS CHRIST AND THE OLD SOLDIER.</h3>
 <p>ONCE upon a time, when Jesus Christ was going with His disciples to Jerusalem, He met an old man, and asked alms of him. The old man said to Him:</p>
 <p>"I am an old soldier, and they sent me away from the army with only two sous, because I was no longer good for anything. I have already given away one sou on the road; I have only one left, and I give that to you."</p>
 <p>Then our Lord says to him, "Which would you prefer, a sack of gold or Paradise?"</p>
 <p>St. Peter gently nudges the old man in the ribs, "Say Paradise."</p>
 <p>"What! Paradise!" says the old soldier. "Afterwards we shall have Paradise as well. I prefer a sack of gold."</p>
 <p>And our Lord gives him the sack of gold, and He said as He gave it to him:</p>
 <p>"When this sack is empty it will be sufficient to say, '<i>Artchila murtchila</i>! go into my sack,' and everything you wish for will go into the sack."</p>
 <p>Our man takes the sack and goes on his road. When he had gone a little way he passed before the door of an inn, and sees a fine leg of mutton on the table. He was hungry, and, opening his sack, he said:</p>
 <p>"<i>Artchila murtchila</i>! fine leg of mutton, come into my</p>
 <p><a name="page_200"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 200</font></a></p>
 <p>sack!" and in an instant it was in it; and in the same way he had everything he wished for.</p>
 <p>One day the devil came to tempt this old man, but, as soon as he heard him, he opened his sack and said:</p>
 <p>"<i>Artchila murtchila</i>! go into my sack!"</p>
 <p>And the devil himself entered into the sack. He takes the sack with the devil in it to a blacksmith, and for a long time and very vigorously he pounded it with his sledgehammer.</p>
 <p>When the old soldier died he went to Paradise. When he arrived there St. Peter appears, and says to him:</p>
 <p>"Why are you standing there? And what are you asking for?"</p>
 <p>"Paradise."</p>
 <p>"What! Paradise!! Did not you prefer to have a sack of gold when God gave you the choice? Be off from here. Be off to hell. There are the gates, there."</p>
 <p>Our old man, in deepest sadness, goes to the door of hell, and knocks; but as soon as the door was opened the devil recognised his soldier, and began to cry out:</p>
 <p>"Don't let him come in! Don't let him come in! He will cause us too much trouble, and too many misfortunes. He is so very vicious!"</p>
 <p>And he will not receive him; so he returns again to Paradise, and God commanded St. Peter to let this man enter who had been such a foe to the devil.</p>
