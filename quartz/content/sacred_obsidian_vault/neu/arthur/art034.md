align="CENTER">ROBERT BUCHANAN</h2>  </center>  <br>  <br>  <br>                 I. <br>  <br>  With goodly lands and lordships<br>           In Bearn and Britany,<br>  Hath Launcelot freely dowered his knights<br>           Had passed with him the sea;<br>  A threescore knights had brothers been<br>           All of the Table Round --<br>  Were left no threescore braver,<br>           I wot, on British ground.<br>  Their wars an end, the sheathed sword<br>           They dangle from the wall,<br>  And feast them free, each bounteous lord,<br>           In hospitable hall.<br>  For trumpet's breath and clarion,<br>           The minstrel's harp they hear;<br>  And ladies' eyes make bosoms bleed,<br>           Had bled to shaft and spear.<br>  <br>                 II.<br>  <br>  Alas!  that Hate's foul blossom<br>           On Love's own tree will blow!<br>  And friendship stranged, that friend will prove<br>           To friend the fellest foe.<br>  Across the deep, from Cardiff's keep,<br>           A threescore thousand men<br>  Have followed Arthur and Gawayne,<br>           And camped in fair Guienne;<br>  And terms of ransom they have laughed,<br>           And truce to haughty scorn;<br>  For dead to do Sir Launcelot<br>           The fierce Gawayne hath sworn.<br>  <br>                 III.<br>  <br>  But stout is Benwyk's castle,<br>           And Benwyk's trench is deep;<br>  Are gate and drawbridge massy-strong,<br>           And Benwyk's walls are steep;<br>  And on these walls are archers store<br>           Handle their bows with skill,<br>  And shaft for shaft, and shout for shout,<br>           They render with good will.<br>  <br>                 IV.<br>  <br>  Rode proudly on his coal-black steed<br>           Sir Gawayne forth each morn,<br>  And blew defy to Launcelot,<br>           And hailed with names of scorn.<br>  It shamed them sore that brave threescore,<br>           Such knightly blot to bide;<br>  And will, or nill, Sir Launcelot,<br>           Must Bors to battle ride.<br>  <br>                 V. <br>  <br>  Out gate, and over drawbridge,<br>           In fell career he's flung;<br>  But man and horse, in midway course,<br>           To earth hath Gawayne dung.<br>  Spurred to his brother's help at need,<br>           Sir Lionel, in vain!<br>  With shivered lance, in ghostly trance,<br>           He stretches on the plain.<br>  <br>  *****************************<br>  <br>                 VI.<br>  <br>  And thus each morn rode Gawayne,<br>           And mocked them day by day,<br>  And evil fared the venturous knight<br>           Would Gawayne's arm essay.<br>  Till <i> traitor</i>  thrice, and <i> coward</i>  too,<br>           Sir Launcelot he appealed;<br>  He clenched his teeth, he clutched his spear,<br>           And rushed into the field.<br>  <br>  *****************************<br>  <br>                 VII.<br>  <br>  "Or art thou man," thought Launcelot,<br>           "Or art thou evil fiend?"<br>  But pause or parley as they fought<br>           For three hours an end.<br>  And many a bruise and buffet,<br>           On casque and coat he bore,<br>  For as his strength was waning,<br>           But waxed Sir Gawayne's more,<br>  Sith unto him when shriven --<br>           If sooth the story ran --<br>  This wondrous gift of grace was given<br>           On prayer of holy man,<br>  That day by day, from morn to noon --<br>           And by a twelve month's space --<br>  His strength should go on waxing<br>           For long three long hours apace.<br>  But sooth or not, I nothing wot<br>           That gift, as others say,<br>  Was power from hell, and won by spell<br>           Him taught his aunt Le Fay,<br>  For spite she bore Queen Guinevere,<br>           Led Arthur to her bower,<br>  The when she lay in sinful play<br>           Aclasp with paramour.<br>  <br>  *****************************<br>  <br>                 VIII.<br>  <br>  But now is passed the turn of noon,<br>           Sir Gawayne's gift is shent;<br>  He has no strength save but his own,<br>           And that right sorely spent.<br>  In stirrup stark stood Launcelot,<br>           And swayed his sword amain, --<br>  That stroke hath felled Sir Gawayne<br>           Astound upon the plain.<br>  "Now use thy vantage -- slay me,<br>           As I would thee outright;"<br>  "I slay me ne'er," said Launcelot,<br>           "On field a fallen knight."<br>  Then proudly turned, and slowly<br>           To Benwyk took his way;<br>  Was loud rejoice in Benwyk,<br>           In Arthur's host dismay.<br>  On litter low that wounded knight<br>           To Arthur's tent they bore.<br>  The where on weary bed he lay<br>           A long three weeks and more.<br>  <br>  *****************************<br>  <br>                 IX.<br>  <br>  "Go saddle me my starkest steed --<br>           Go fetch my stoutest spear --<br>  And bring me speed,"  cried Launcelot --<br>           "My trustiest battle-gear."<br>  Like thunder-clouds they clash, they crash,<br>           Their staves a'flinter flee;<br>  That furious course dashed man and horse<br>           To earth right heavily.<br>  And foot to foot they counter,<br>           And cross them shield with shield;<br>  More stern or stout in bloody bout<br>           I wot ne'er strove on field.<br>  <br>                 X.<br>  <br>  But ever this time Sir Launcelot<br>           His buckler's fence below<br>  With patient art traced warily,<br>           And traversed to and fro: --<br>  And long on casque and corslet<br>           Full grievous dint he bore,<br>  And many a fountain spirted<br>           Its crimson jet of gore!<br>  <br>                 XI.<br>  <br>  But when three hours were ended,<br>           By token sure he knew<br>  Sir Gawayne's strength was ebbing fast,<br>           His blows fell faint and few: --<br>  And shouting loud his battle-cry,<br>           He smote with main and might<br>  So fast, so fell, Sir Gawayne<br>           Swooned on the field outright.<br>  <br>  *****************************<br>  <br>                 XII.<br>  <br>  A wounded man, on sore sick-bed<br>           For weary months he lay,<br>  Till false Sir Mordred's treason<br>           Called Arthur's host away.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br> <br>
