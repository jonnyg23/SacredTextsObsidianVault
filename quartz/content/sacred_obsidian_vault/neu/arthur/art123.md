THE FIRST COMING OF THE DOVE.<br>  <br>  Hard by the confluence of Rhone<br>  A castle of old times alone<br>     Upon a high grey hill did stand,<br>     And look'd across the pleasant land:<br>  And of the castle castellain<br>  And lord of all the wide domain<br>     Of golden field and purple wood<br>     And vineyards where the vine-rows stood<br>  In many a trellis, Floris was;<br>  A good knight and a valorous,<br>     And in all courtesies approved,<br>     That unto valiantise behoved.<br>  Full young he was and fair of face,<br>  And among ladies had much grace,<br>     And favour of all men likewise:<br>     For in such stout and valiant guise<br>  His years of manhood had he spent<br>  In knightly quest and tournament,<br>     There was no knight in all the land<br>     Whose name in more renown did stand,<br>  And the foe quaked to look upon<br>  The white plume of his morion,<br>     When through the grinding shock of spears<br>     Sir Floris' war-cry pierced their ears<br>  And over all the din was blown<br>  The silver of his clarion.<br>  <br>     So was much ease prepared for him,<br>     And safety from the need and grim<br>  Hard battle against gibe and sneer<br>  That must full oft be foughten here--<br>     For evil fortune and the lack<br>     Of strength to thrust the envious back--<br>  By many a noble soul and true;<br>  And had he chosen to ensue<br>     The well-worn path that many tread<br>     For worship, all his life were spread<br>  Before him, level with delight.<br>  But if in shock of arms and fight<br>     Of squadrons he disdainèd not<br>     To win renown, the silken lot<br>  Of those that pass their days in ease<br>  And dalliance on the flower'd leas<br>     Of life was hateful to his soul;<br>     And so--when once the battle's roll<br>  And thunder was from off the lands<br>  Turn'd back and from the war-worn hands<br>     The weapons fell--he could not bring<br>     His heart to brook the wearying<br>  Of peace and indolent disport<br>  Of ease.  Wherefore he left the court--<br>     So secretly that no one knew<br>     Awhile his absence--and withdrew<br>  A season to his own demesne,<br>  And there in solitude was fain<br>     To yearn for some fair chance to hap<br>     And win his living from the lap<br>  Of drowsy idlesse with some quest,<br>  That should from that unlovely rest<br>     Redeem him to the old delight<br>     Of plucking--in the bold despite<br>  Of danger--from the brows of Fate<br>  Some laurel.  Nor had he to wait<br>     The cooling of his knightly fire;<br>     There was vouchsafed to his desire,<br>  Ere long, a very parlous quest,<br>  That should unto the utterest<br>  Assay his knightly worth and test<br>     The temper of his soul full well<br>     And sore.  And in this wise it fell.<br>  <br>  It chanced one night,--most nigh the time<br>  When through the mist-wreaths and the rime<br>     The hours begin to draw toward<br>     The enchanted birthnight of the Lord,--<br>  That in the midnight, on his bed,<br>  He heard in dreams, a voice that said<br>     "Arise, Sir Floris, get thee forth,<br>     An thou wouldst prove thee knight of worth!"<br>  Gross slumbers of the middle night<br>  So held and clipp'd the valiant knight,<br>     He might him not to speak address<br>     For slumber and for heaviness.<br>  <br>  Again it rang out loud and clear,<br>  So that might not choose but hear,<br>  And in his heart he quaked for fear;<br>     But still he lay and answer'd not,<br>     Such hold had sleep upon him got.<br>  <br>  A third time through the chamber past<br>  The voice, as 'twere a trumpet's blast:<br>     "Arise, Sir Floris, harness thee,<br>     For love of Christ that died on tree!"<br>  <br>  He started up from sleep for fear<br>  And groped to find a sword or spear,<br>  Thinking some enemy was near;<br>     But of no creature was he ware.<br>     He saw the moon hang in the air--<br>  As 'twere a cup of lucent pearl--<br>  And in the distance heard the swirl<br>     Of waters through the silence run;<br>     But other sight or sound was none.<br>  <br>  The moon's light lay across the night<br>  In one great stream of silver-white,<br>     And folded round the Christ that stood<br>     At bedhead, carven in black wood;<br>  And Floris, looking on the way<br>  Of light that through the chamber lay,<br>     Was ware of a strange blossoming--<br>     As of some birth of holy thing--<br>  That in the bar of silver stirr'd;<br>  And as he gazed, a snow-white bird<br>     Grew slowly into perfect shape,<br>     As if some virtue did escape<br>  From that strange silver prisonhouse<br>  Into the city perilous<br>     Of life, and for its safety's sake<br>     The likeness of a fowl did take.<br>  The light seem'd loth to let it go<br>  Into this world of sin and woe<br>     (So pure and holy) and put out<br>     Long arms of white the dove about,<br>  As if to net it safely in:<br>  But, as the holy bird did win<br>     It way and through the meshes rent,<br>     The rays of light together blent<br>  And fell into a cross of white,<br>  Whereon the silver dove did light<br>     Above the image benedight.<br>  <br>     Sir Floris wonder'd at the sight,<br>  And looking on the cross, he deem'd<br>  That from the Christ a glory gleam'd<br>     And lay in gold towards the door;<br>     And something bade him go before.<br>  <br>  He rose and girt himself upon<br>  With helm and with habergeon,<br>     And in his hand his sword full bright<br>     He bore, that Fleurdeluceaunt hight.<br>  <br>  The dove flew out into the air,<br>  And Floris follow'd through the bare<br>     Dumb ways and chambers to the gate,<br>     Whose open leaves for them did wait,<br>  And as into the night they past,<br>  Together were behind them cast.<br>  <br>     The night was dumb, the moon did glower<br>     Upon them, like a pale sick flower<br>  That in the early chill of spring<br>  Mocks at the summer's blossoming,<br>     And over every hill and stowe<br>     The ways were white and sad with snow.<br>  <br>  So pass'd he, with the silver dove<br>  That went before him and above,<br>     Within the sheeny moonés light--<br>     Wherewith her outspread plumes were dight<br>  So that it seem'd each wing became<br>  And grew into a silver flame--<br>     Until the hollow'd snow was track'd <br>     Into a woodway, where there lack'd<br>  The moonlight, and the mountain-side<br>  With drooping ash and linden vied<br>     To keep the hollow place from ray<br>     Or glimmer of the silver-play.<br>  <br>  The dove flew in, and, following,<br>  Sir Floris heard a muffled ring<br>     Of silver in the mountain's womb,<br>     As if dead music there had tomb.<br>  Here the dove folded wings and smote<br>  The part wherefrom the sound did float.<br>  <br>     The mountain open'd, and they went,<br>     By force of some strange wonderment,<br>     Into a place of flowers, all sprent<br>  With jewels of the blossom-time;<br>  And all the air was sweet with rhyme:<br>  There reign'd an endless summer-prime.<br>     Tall green was there of leaféd trees,<br>     And in the blossom'd walks the breeze<br>  Was music, such as winds and plays<br>  About the May-sweet woodland ways,<br>     When spring is fresh and hope is clear;<br>     And in the place where leaves are sere<br>  On earth, there lay great heaps of gold,<br>  Yweft my wonderment untold<br>     To semblance of the Autumn's waste,<br>     Through which the sweet wind play'd and chased<br>  Its frolic breaths with perfume laden.<br>  <br>  In grass stood many a white maiden<br>     That lily in the outworld hight;<br>     And roses all the herbage dight.<br>  Bright plaited beds of jewel-flowers<br>  Were thick-set in the garden bowers,<br>     And many a row of sunflowers stood<br>     Along the marges of the wood,<br>  And to the sapphire heaven turn'd,<br>  As if towards the sun they burn'd.<br>     About the blossoms, round and over,<br>     Strange golden-crested birds did hover<br>  That flash'd and sparkled like a flight<br>  Of wingèd starlets in the night;<br>     And, as they went, their pinions beat<br>     The air of that serene retreat<br>  To rush and sweep of magic song,<br>  And through the trees was sweet and strong<br>     The trill of lark and nightingale.<br>     There was not any note of wail<br>  In song of birds or sweep of wind,<br>  Such as in woodlands calls to mind<br>     The last year's winter and the next,<br>     Wherewith the listener's soul is vext<br>  And thinks how short the spring will be,<br>  And how the flower-times change and flee<br>     Towards the dreary month of snows.<br>     The full glad passion of the rose<br>  Was joyous in the garden air,<br>  And every sight and sound was fair<br>     With unalloy'd contentedness.<br>     There could not enter any stress<br>  Of labour or of worldly woe;<br>  But ever through the place did flow<br>     A silver sound of singing winds,<br>     A breath of jasmine and woodbinds,<br>  As if all joy were gather'd there<br>  And prison'd in the golden air.<br>  <br>     And as Sir Floris wonderèd<br>     At those sweet flow'rets white and red,<br>  And at the stream's sweet song that set<br>  The garden-breezes all afret<br>     With breaking waves of melody,<br>     And at the bird's sweet minstrelsy,--<br>  There came to him a damozel<br>  (How fair she was no man can tell),<br>  And said, "Fair knight, now wit thou well<br>     That thou hast gather'd great renown<br>     In that sad world where trees are brown<br>  And ways are white in winter-time,<br>  And hast in many a maker's rhyme<br>     Been celebrate for gentilesse<br>     And valiant doings in the press<br>  Of armèd knights and battle-play,<br>  In tournament and in mellay;<br>     And over all the land is known<br>     How, many a time, thy horn has blown<br>  To succour maidens in distress,<br>  And oftentimes have had redress<br>     The needy by thy stroke of sword.<br>     So that to him, that is the lord<br>  Of this fair place, the fame has won<br>  Of all that thou hast dared and done<br>     In perfectness of chivalry;<br>     And he, who uses well to see<br>  Great deeds of arms and shock of spears,<br>  Has seen no one in all these years<br>     That may be chosen for thy peer;  <br>     And therefore has he brought thee here,<br>  To try thee if thou canst endure<br>  Battle and venture, forte et dure<br>     Beyond the wont of men on earth;<br>     Wherein if thou canst prove thy worth,<br>  He will advance thee to his grace<br>  And set thee surely in high place<br>     Among his knights."<br>  <br>                                "Fair damozel,"<br>     Said Floris, "liketh me full well<br>  The quest, by what you say of it:<br>  But now, I pray you, let me wit<br>     Who is this lord, whose hest you bear,<br>     That is so high and debonair?<br>  And what adventure must I prove<br>  Before that I can win his love?"<br>     And she, "His name I may not tell;<br>     Hereafter shalt thou know it well;<br>  But thou shalt see his presently."<br>  <br>     Then did she join her bended palms,<br>  And falling down upon her knee<br>     Among the knitted herbs and haulms,<br>  Did softly sing a full sweet rhyme;<br>  And in a little space of time<br>     Was visible among the treen--<br>     Against a trellised work of green<br>  That at the garden's farthest end<br>  Among the leaves did twine and blend--<br>     A man, that walk'd among the flowers<br>     As softly as the evening hours<br>  Walk in the summer-haunted treen.<br>  Full tall and stately was his mien,<br>     And down his back the long hair lay,<br>     Red-gold as is the early day,<br>  Whereon a crown of light was set.<br>  Whoever saw might ne'er forget.<br>     The sweetness of his majesty.<br>     But in no wise could Floris see<br>  Or win to look upon his face;<br>  For, as he went, he turn'd aside<br>     His visage, as it were to hide<br>  The light of its unearthly grace<br>     From mortal eyes.<br>  <br>                                Then Floris said,<br>  "I pray thee of thy kindlihead,<br>     Fair maid, that I may come to look<br>     On this lord's visage."  But she shook<br>  Her head, and  "Patience!" did she say.<br>  "Thou must in fear and much affray<br>     For this fair place, and for the fame<br>     Of him that master of the same<br>  And sovereign is, be purged and tried,<br>  And through much venture must abide,<br>     Ere thou mayst look upon his face<br>     And win the guerdon of his grace,<br>  And now the time is come to prove<br>  Battle and hardship for his love.<br>     Adieu, sir knight: be bold and true!"<br>  <br>     Whereat she sped beyond his view,<br>  And eke that figure vanishèd;<br>  But Floris, lifting up his head,<br>     Was ware of a strange hand that bare<br>     A cross and stood in middle air,<br>  And on the white plume of his crest<br>  Did for a moment lie and rest.<br>     Therewith great ease was given him,<br>     And healing freedom from all dim<br>  Sad doubts of fortune and of fate<br>  In that great strife, that did await<br>     His proving; and the strength of men<br>     In him was as the strength of ten<br>  Redoubled.  Then he saw, beside<br>  His feet, a flower-bed fair and wide<br>     Of roses mingled red and white,<br>     Full sweet of smell and fair of sight,<br>  That in a trellised red-gold grate<br>  Did hold a sweet and lovely state<br>     And spread around such wealth of balm,<br>     Their scent seem'd one great golden psalm<br>  Of perfume to the praise of God.<br>  <br>  Then Floris knelt upon the sod<br>     Of that fair place, and praying thrice<br>     Most heartily, did take advice<br>  That up the silver-spangled grail--<br>  That through the green did twine and trail<br>     Of that bright garden's goodliness--<br>     Some gruesome thing towards him did press.<br>  As 'twere the roses to despoil.<br>  So sprang he lightly from the soil,<br>     And from its scabbard iron-blue<br>     His falchion Fleurdeluceaunt drew,<br>  And kiss'd its fair hilt cruciform;<br>  Wherewith his heart wax'd bold and warm<br>     With courage past the use of men.<br>  <br>     Now was a loathly thing, I ween,<br>  Made visible to him--that might<br>  Well strike the boldest with affright.<br>     For up the sward to him did run<br>     A beast yet never saw the sun;<br>  As 'twere a dog with double head,<br>  Whose hinder parts were fashionèd<br>     Into the likeness of a worm.<br>     Full black and grisly was his form,<br>  And blazing red his eyes and tongue<br>  With raging choler, such as stung<br>     His lusting heart to rob and tear<br>     The flowers that in the garden were.<br>  But as he came anigh the place<br>  Wherein those roses all did grace<br>     The greensward, to his troubled sight<br>     Was visible that valiant knight,<br>  That in whole armour of blue steel<br>  Before the flowery shrine did kneel,<br>     To save the emblems of Love's joy<br>     From his most foul and rude annoy.<br>  Wherefore at him with open mouth <br>  The monster ran, as 'twere its drouth<br>     And ravening lust to wreak and slake<br>     Upon the knight.  Then did he take<br>  His sword, and with so stout a blow<br>  Upon the beast's twin neck did throw<br>     The edge, that with the dolorous stroke<br>     The thread of its foul life he broke<br>  In twain, and from the sunder'd veins<br>  The black blood strew'd with loathly stains<br>     The tender grass and herbs therein;<br>     And as among the flower-stalks thin<br>  The hideous purple gore was sprent,<br>  From out the stain (O wonderment<br>     And grace of Mary merciful!)<br>     There open'd out the petals full<br>  And lovesome of that snowy bloom<br>  That is in all earth's sin and gloom<br>     The fairest of all flowers to see,<br>     The lily of white chastity.<br>  <br>  Right glad was Floris of the sight,<br>  And of the scent that from the white<br>     Gold-hearted bells to him was lent;<br>     And as he o'er the calyx bent<br>  To breathe its fragrance, suddenly<br>  There came a sound across the lea,<br>     That was as if a lion roar'd;<br>     And truly o'er the blossom'd sward<br>  There ran to him a tawny beast,<br>  Red-maned, that never stay'd nor ceased<br>     To roar, until the knight could feel<br>     His hot breath through the grated steel<br>  That barr'd his vizor, and his claws<br>  Sought grimly for some joint or pause<br>     In the hard mail, where he might set<br>     His tusks and through the rent veins let<br>  The knight's life-blook upon the sward.<br>  But Floris, lifting up his sword,<br>     Him with such doughty strokes oppress'd<br>     Upon his red and haughty crest,<br>  That soon he made him loose his hold;<br>  And in a while, no longer bold<br>     And arrogant, he would have fled,<br>     But that Sir Floris on his head<br>  With the sharp edge smote such a blow,<br>  The red blood from the rift did flow,<br>     And with the blood the life did pass:<br>     Wherefore from out the bloodied grass<br>  There was uplift the rose of love,<br>  With scent and blossom fair enough,<br>     I trow, to guerdon many a toil<br>     And many a battle in the coil<br>  Of earthly woes.<br>  <br>                                But there was yet<br>  No time for Floris to forget<br>     His trouble in the red flower's sight:<br>     He must again in deathly fight<br>  Be join'd for the security<br>  Of that fair garden's purity.<br>     For swiftly in the lion's place<br>     A raging leopard came, the grace<br>  Of those sweet roses to despoil;<br>  And as he came, the very soil<br>     Quaked underneath him, such a might<br>     To wreak his cholerick despite<br>  'Gainst him that was the sovereign<br>  Of that fair place, and such disdain<br>     Did rage in him, that he could see<br>     No thing for anger.  So was he <br>  Against the roses well nigh come,<br>  Nay, was in act to spoil their bloom,<br>     When through his heart the deadly blade<br>     Slid cold; and turning round, he made<br>  At Floris with a vengeful roar,<br>  And with his claws his thigh he tore<br>     A hand's-breadth in his agony.<br>     Then down upon the grass fell he<br>  And died; and in the tender sward,<br>  Whereon his felon blood was pour'd,<br>     The sign of humbleness was set,<br>     The flower that men call violet.<br>  <br>  Full faint was Floris with the loss<br>  Of blood, that from the wound across<br>     His thigh did run in many a rill,<br>     And would have fain awhile been still<br>  Without reproof.  But no repose<br>  Must he expect (nor one of those<br>     That in God's battle fight on earth)<br>     Nor pleasance of delight and mirth,<br>  But many a dint and many a blow<br>  Unceasing, till God will his woe<br>     Be ended and the goal be won.<br>  <br>     And so, as there he sat, anon,<br>  Whilst wearily he look'd along<br>  The fair wide path, he saw the long <br>     Slow travel of a hideous snake,<br>     That with much toil its way did make<br>     Towards the roses where he stood.<br>     So faint he was with failing blood,<br>  He might not summon any strength<br>  To smite its black and gruesome length<br>     At vantage, crawling, but must wait<br>     Until, with slow and tortuous gait,<br>  It won to him.  So weak he was,<br>  He could not choose but let it pass<br>     Towards the trellis; and eftsoon,<br>     By him that lay in some half swoon,<br>  Across the grass it slid and twined<br>  Around the grating that confined<br>     The flowers, its black and hideous length,<br>     And breathed on them with all the strength<br>  Of hate its envying soul could know<br>  To gather in a breath, and so<br>     To spoil their fresh and goodly bloom:<br>     Whereat the blossoms with the gloom<br>  Of its black coils, that shut the light<br>  From over them, and with affright<br>     And sickness of its loathsome breath,<br>     Came very nigh to take their death.<br>  For with such potent spells the air<br>  Its venom darken'd of despair<br>     And malice, that the lovely red<br>     And white of their bright goodlihead<br>  Was to a sickly pallor turn'd,<br>  As if some loathly fever burn'd<br>     Within their hearts: and in a while<br>     No kiss of breeze or golden smile<br>  Of sun had won them back to life,<br>  So spent were they with the fell strife<br>     Of that curs'd beast,--had not a sweep<br>     Of wings awaken'd from the sleep<br>  Of pain Sir Floris, and the scream<br>  Of a great bird, whose plumes did seem<br>     To brush his forehead, roused his sense<br>     From the constraint of indolence.<br>  <br>  Then sprang he up in strength renew'd;<br>  And when he saw the serpent lewd<br>     And hideous, that in his embrace<br>     Did strangle all the life and grace<br>  From out the flowers, he made at him<br>  And with a grip so fierce and grim<br>     Oppres'd his scaly swollen neck,<br>     That with the dolour and the check<br>  Of blood within his venom'd veins,<br>  The snake must needs relax the chains<br>     In which he held the rosery;<br>     And in the act so mightily<br>  Had leapt at Floris, that he wound<br>  His arms and body closely round<br>     With scaly rings, and so uneath<br>     Did grip the knight, that little breath<br>  Seem'd in his body to be left;<br>  But, summoning all strength, he reft<br>     The horrid fetters from his breast,<br>     And flung the worm with utterest<br>  His might full length against the ground.<br>  <br>  There whiles it lay in seeming swound;<br>     And Floris, thinking it was dead,<br>     Would have lain down his weary head<br>  Upon the grass, to take some ease<br>  Awhile.  Then from among the trees<br>     There came that fowl, that had awoke<br>     Him with its passing pinions' stroke,<br>  And with so hard a buffet drove<br>  Him down to earth, he could nor move<br>     Nor speak awhile, but lay as dead:<br>     And that foul bird, with eyes of red<br>  And vulture claws, did strive the while<br>  At every joint and crack of mail<br>     To wound him with its noisome beak.<br>     At last a place it found where weak<br>  The armour was, and with such spite<br>  Into Sir Floris' flesh did bite,<br>     That for the fierceness of the pain<br>     He started up from sleep again<br>  And with so fierce and stout a blow<br>  The vulture strake, the steel did go<br>     Athwart the pinions and the crest,<br>     And riving down the armour'd breast,<br>  Did hew the gruesome snake in twain,<br>  In whom the life began again<br>     To flutter.  So the loathly two<br>     With that stroke died; and with the dew<br>  Of their foul blood, the lovely green<br>  Of the fair sward did such a spleen<br>     And hate of its despiteous hue<br>     Conceive, that quickly sprang to view<br>  A twine of slow-white clematis,<br>  The sign of sweet content that is;<br>     And where the bird in death was cold,<br>     There grew the glad bright marigold,<br>  That in its gay and golden dress<br>  Was ever symbol of largesse,<br>     Since all along the meads there run<br>     Its mimic mirrors of the sun,<br>  Withouten any speck or flaw.<br>  <br>  But none of this Sir Floris saw,<br>     Nor how the roses lightly wore<br>     The freshness of their bloom once more;<br>  So weary was he and so worn<br>  With strife, and therewithal so torn<br>     With claws and beak of that fierce bird,<br>     He lay aswoon and saw nor heard<br>  Or sight or sound.<br>  <br>                                Now must I tell<br>  A wondrous thing that here befell,<br>     Through grace of God and Christ, His Son:<br>     For, while he lay aswoon, came one<br>  In white and shining robes array'd,<br>  And touch'd him on the lips and said,<br>     "Arise, Sir Floris, whole of wound,<br>  And fill thy quest!"  And so was gone.<br>     And Floris started up from ground,<br>  And was all whole in flesh and bone<br>     And full of heart the end to dare<br>     Of that hard venture.<br>  <br>                                Then the air<br>  Was of a sudden darken'd o'er<br>  With some foul thing, that semblance wore<br>     Of a half bird, and a half worm,<br>     Join'd in one foul and loathly form;<br>  And with the rattle of the scales<br>  Upon its wings--that (as huge flails<br>     Upon the golden garnered wheat <br>     With ceaseless rhythmic pulse do beat)<br>  Did lash and wound the golden air--<br>  The songs of breezes deadn'd were,<br>     And all was dumb for much dismay:<br>     And with its sight the lift grew gray.<br>  And as it wheel'd on open wings,<br>  With many blows and buffetings<br>     It strove to daunt that valiant knight<br>     And enforce him for sheer affright<br>  To yield to it and let it fill<br>  Its hungry maw at its foul will<br>     With those fair flowers.  But Floris stood<br>     Undaunted, and with many a good<br>  Stout stroke of point did wound the beast,<br>  Werewith it bled and much increased<br>     Its ravenous rage.  Then, suddenly,<br>     He felt sharp claws about his knee,<br>  And, looking down, no little wroth,<br>  He saw a huge and monstrous sloth,<br>     That with such force did hug his thighs<br>     And gript his arms in such hard wise,<br>  That he could scarce with bended shield<br>  Resist him, nor with power could wield<br>     His trusty sword; and as he strove<br>     That monster from his grip to move,<br>  The dragon with so fell a swoop<br>  Against him from on high did stoop,<br>     That down upon the ground he fell,<br>     And in the falling did repel<br>  The sloth from off him.  Then the twain<br>  With such foul rage at him again<br>     Did press and buffet, that the life<br>     Out of his breast with that fierce strife<br>  Was well nigh chased: but, by good hap,<br>  It chanced he fell into the lap<br>     Of those fair blooms of various kind<br>     That did his victory call to mind<br>  Against the cruel beaten foes; <br>  And, falling heavily from blows<br>     Of beak and tallons, he with such<br>     A grinding weight did press and crush<br>  The blossoms in the harsh and rude<br>  Encounter, they must needs exude<br>     From out their chalices the sweet<br>     And precious essences that meet<br>  To make the perfume of a flower,<br>  And on his face and hands did shower<br>     Their gracious balms.  So sweet they were<br>     And of a potency so rare<br>  For salving every earthly pain,<br>  The life began in every vein<br>     With their pure touch to run and glow;<br>     And soon the weary weight and woe<br>  That lay on Floris was dispell'd.<br>  Then, with new strength, from him he fell'd<br>     That hideous sloth; and being free<br>     An instant from his tyranny<br>  And harsh oppression, to his feet<br>  He sprang once more, and to defeat<br>     The wingèd worm himself address'd.<br>     That tore and ravish'd at his crest<br>  With ceaseless fury; but it drew<br>  Beyond his reaching, when it knew<br>     Its comrade worsted, and was fain<br>     To wait till it revived again.<br>  But Floris, with a doubled hand,<br>  Smote at the bear with his good brand<br>     So fell a stroke, the sharp death slid<br>     Through bone and sinew and forbid<br>  Returning life to enter in<br>  That loathly dwelling, foul with sin<br>     And sloth;--and so the thing was dead.<br>     And from the blood its slit veins bled<br>  There came to life the blossoms sweet<br>  And gold-eyed of the Marguerite,<br>     Incoronate with petals white.<br>  <br>     But that foul serpent with the sight<br>  Of that good blow so sorely grieved<br>  And fill'd with rage to be bereaved<br>     Of its grim comrade was, it threw<br>     All fear aside and fiercely flew<br>  At Floris, with the armèd sting<br>  Of its writhed tail all quivering<br>     In act to strike, and with so strong<br>     A swoop the dart did thrust and throng<br>  Through dent and ring of riven mail,<br>  The deadly point it did prevail<br>     To bury deep in Floris' breast.<br>     Whereat such rage the knight possess'd<br>  That all the dolour he forgot<br>  (Though very fierce it was, God wot,<br>     And sad) and throwing down his blade,<br>     With such a mighty force he laid<br>  To drag that scorpion from his side,<br>  The serpent's tail in twain he wried<br>     And in such hideous wounds it rent,<br>     That from the body coil'd and bent<br>  With anguish it must needs divide.<br>  Wherewith the cleft did open wide,<br>     And such a flood therefrom did flow<br>     Of blood upon the herbs below<br>  That needs it seem'd the flowers must die;<br>  And with the pain so fierce a cry<br>     Of agony the dragon gave,<br>     There is no heart of man so brave<br>  And firm but he must quake at it.<br>  <br>  And now the doom of death was writ<br>     In heaven for that unholy beast;<br>     And in a little while it ceased<br>  To cry, and down upon the ground<br>  It fell and died; and all around<br>     The firm earth quaked.  And as it died,<br>     The blood--that wither'd far and wide<br>  The herbs and 'mid the stalks did boil<br>  For rage--was dried into the soil;<br>     Wherefore there sprang from out the stain<br>     The holy purple of vervain,<br>  The plant that purgeth earth's desire.<br>  <br>  Now may Sir Floris well aspire<br>     To have that peace he needeth so,<br>     And easance after toil and woe:<br>  For there is none to fight with him<br>  Of all those beasts so fell and grim;<br>     Nor any sign of further foe<br>     Within the garden is, I trow,<br>  To let him from his victory;<br>  And all around the place was free<br>     From fear; the breezes were atune<br>     Again with birdsongs, and the boon<br>  Of scent within the flowers once more<br>  Was golden, nor the heavens wore<br>     The hue of horror and dismay:<br>     And so me may be blithe and gay<br>  And have sweet pleasance.<br>  <br>                                But alas!<br>  No thought of this for Floris was.<br>     Within his veins the venom 'gan<br>     To curdle, and the red blood ran<br>  With frozen slowness, as the sting<br>  Of pain went ever gathering<br>     Fresh fierceness through him.  Very nigh<br>     It seem'd to him he was to die.<br>  He felt the chill of the last hour<br>  Creep through him and the deathsweats pour<br>     Adown his brow: such agony<br>     Along his every vein did flee,<br>  He could no longer up endure,<br>  Nor hope for any aid or cure;<br>     But down upon the earth he sank<br>     Aswoon, with faded lips that drank<br>  The dews of death, and, with a prayer<br>  Half mutter'd in his last despair,<br>     The sense forsook him.  So he lay<br>     Aswoon, poor knight, and (well-a-way!)<br>  Most like to die.<br>  <br>                                But there was thought<br>  In heaven for him that thus had fought<br>     For that fair garden's sake.  The love<br>     Of the dear God that dwells above<br>  Was mindful of him, though he knew<br>  It not.  And so to him there drew<br>     A tender dream,--as there he lay<br>     Smitten to death with that fierce fray,--<br>  And fill'd his thought; and it did seem<br>  To him, by virtue of the dream,<br>     That over him an angel stood,<br>     And with a sweet compassion view'd<br>  His piteous state, and whiles did strew<br>  Soft balms upon him, strange and new<br>     Unto his sense,--so comforting<br>     And sweet of scent, they seem'd to bring<br>  To him the airs of Paradise;<br>  And with their touch the cruel ice<br>     Of death, that bound his every sense,<br>     Was melted wholly; and the dense<br>  And cruel anguish, that untied<br>  The threads of living, did subside;<br>     And gradually peace came back<br>     Into his spirit, and the rack<br>  Of pain and agony from him<br>  Was lifted.  So upon the rim<br>     Of the sad soul a little life<br>     Began to hover, as at strife<br>  With Death, reluctant to forego<br>  His late assurèd prey; and so<br>     The breath came back by slow degrees<br>     To the spent soul, and in great ease<br>  Awhile he lay: and whiles he dream'd<br>  He was in heaven, and it seem'd<br>     He heard the golden harpings stir<br>     The air to glory, and the choir<br>  Of seraphim that stand around<br>  The throne, with one sweet pulse of sound<br>     Coörder'd, lift descant of praise<br>     To Him that is the Lord of Days<br>  And Ancient.<br>  <br>                                Then he seem'd to hear<br>  A voice that murmur'd in his ear--<br>     As 'twere a ring of broken chords<br>     Angelic, mingled with sweet words<br>  (So silver-clear it was)--and bade<br>  Him open eyes: and then one laid<br>     Soft hand upon his lids, and drew<br>     The darkness from them.  So the blue<br>  Of heaven again was visible<br>  To him, as 'twere some great sweet bell<br>     Of magic flowerage in some prime<br>     Of summer in old fairy-time:<br>  And drinking slowly use of light<br>  And sense of life and its delight<br>     Back into eyes and brain, he turn'd<br>     His gaze from where the heaven burn'd<br>  With full sweet summer, and was ware<br>  Of a fair champion standing there,<br>     Past mortal beauty.   All in white<br>     And spotless mail was he bedight,<br>  So clear that there is nothing fair<br>  And goodly but was mirror'd there,<br>     And yet no evil thing nor sad<br>     Was there.  Upon his helm he had<br>     A fair gold cross.  Upon his crest<br>  A fair gold cross, and on his shield<br>  The semblance of a lamb did wield<br>     A fair gold cross.  Upon his crest    The snows of a fair plume did rest<br>  And waved; and eke his pennoncel<br>  Was white as is the new-blown bell<br>     Of that fair flower that loves the wind,<br>     And round his dexter arm was twined<br>  A snow of silk.  Full glorious<br>  The splendour of his harness was,<br>     And wonder-lovely to behold:<br>     But as white silver and red gold<br>  Are pale beside the diamond,<br>  So was his visage far beyond<br>     His arms in glory and delight<br>     Of beauty.  There was such a might<br>  Of stainless virtue and of all<br>  Perfection pictured, and withal<br>     So woundrous tender in aspèct<br>     He was, it seem'd as if the Elect<br>  Of Christ on earth in him did live;<br>  That, with glad eyes, men might arrive,<br>     Beholding him, to know that love<br>     And gentilesse of God and prove<br>  In him the sweetness of that grace<br>  That shinèd ever in Christ's face<br>     On earth.<br>  <br>                                And so in very deed<br>     It seem'd to Floris that the need<br>  Of earth was over, and his soul<br>  Was won thereto where life is whole--<br>  Withouten any stress or dole--<br>     At last in joyance, and his eyes<br>     Did view, in robes of Paradise,<br>  That tender angel of the Lord,<br>  That into men's sore bosoms pour'd<br>     Sweet balms and comfort, being set<br>     To temper justice and the fret<br>  Of life with love most pitiful.<br>  And whilst he thus did gaze his full<br>     Upon the radiance of that wight,<br>     The soft and undefiled delight,<br>  That in his eyes did hold full sway,<br>  So purged all Floris' awe away<br>     And eke such boldness to him gave<br>     That he was fain of him to crave<br>  His name.<br>  <br>                                Then, "I am Galahad,<br>  Christ's knight," he said.<br>  <br>                                Whereat full glad<br>  was Floris, and all reverently<br>  Unto the earth he bent his knee<br>     Before the knight, and (an he list)<br>     Would fain the broider'd hem have kiss'd<br>  Of his white robe; but Galahad<br>  Did raise him quickly up and bade<br>     Him henceforth kneel to God alone,<br>     That on the height of Heaven's throne<br>  Is for man's soul the only one<br>  Of worship, save sweet Christ, His Son.<br>     And Mary mother pitiful;<br>     And henceforth were no kings that rule<br>  So blest as Floris now should be,<br>  Since that with such high constancy<br>     And noble faith he had withstood<br>     The shock of that unholy brood,<br>  And if fair fight had vanquish'd them.<br>  Wherefore for crown and diadem<br>     Of triumph, on the greensward freed<br>     From those foul beasts that there did bleed<br>  Their life away beneath his blade,<br>  In goodly order were array'd<br>     For him those pleasant blooms and fair,<br>     That not alone so debonair<br>  And blithe of aspect were, but eke<br>  Had virtues--more than one might speak<br>     In wearing of a summer's day--<br>     For purging fleshly lusts away<br>  And cleansing from his heart--who wore<br>  Their beauty fairly--all the sore<br>     Sad doubts and weariness of earth,<br>     So that with an immortal mirth<br>  And constant faith his soul was glad,<br>  And evermore sweet peace he had<br>     In love of God and eke of Christ,<br>     The which against all ills sufficed <br>  Of mortal life.  And as he spoke<br>  From the slight stems those flowers he broke<br>     That 'midst the herbage did entreat<br>     The eye with blossom very sweet<br>  And gracious; and (O wonderment!)<br>  Being in his hand conjoin'd, they blent<br>     Their essences in such rare wise,<br>     It seem'd from each sweet bell did rise<br>  A sweeter perfume, and more bright<br>  Their semblance grew, as 'twere some might<br>     Of amity was moved in them--<br>     Being so join'd into one stem--<br>  To heighten each one's loveliness<br>  With all its fellows did possess<br>     Of blithe and sweet.  And therewithal,<br>     When from the grass those flow'rets all<br>  Were gather'd, to Sir Floris came<br>  That noblest knight, and in Christ's name,<br>     With fairest look and friendliest speech,<br>     Him of kindness did beseech<br>  That he from him those blooms would take<br>  And breathe their fragrance.<br>  <br>                                Scarce awake<br>     From swoon was Floris yet; and so<br>     He took them with dull hands and slow,<br>  And did address himself to scent<br>  Their breath, as one half indolent<br>     With sleep; but when the gracious smell<br>     Was won to him, that from each bell<br>  Did float and hovering was blent<br>  Into some wondrous ravishment<br>     Of sweets,--there smote him such a sense<br>     Of gladsome ease and recompense<br>  Of all his labours, that the dull<br>  Gross drowsiness, that did annul<br>     The soul within the man, forsook<br>     Him wholly; and withal he took<br>  Such gladness, that in every vein<br>  The life seem'd blithely born again;<br>     And through his frame so fresh a flood<br>     Of ardour pour;d, it seem'd the blood--<br>  That in men's pulses sluggishly<br>  Does throb and flutter--was made free<br>     From earthly baseness and was turn'd<br>     To heavenly ichor.  For there burn'd<br>  Within him such a fire of hope,<br>  He felt his soul no more did grope<br>     Within the dreary dusk of earth,<br>     But on the wings of a new birth<br>  Towards the highest heaven did soar.<br>  Nor was there for him any more<br>     A thought of weariness or woe;<br>     But from the earth he rose, and so<br>  Was ready for all venturing<br>  And all the quest of holy thing<br>     God might appoint him.<br>  <br>                                Then that knight,<br>     That was apparell'd  all in white,--<br>  Most brightly smiling at the new<br>  Glad ardour that did straight ensue<br>     In Floris with those blossoms' scent,<br>     And at the holy joy that brent<br>  Upon the dial of his face,--<br>  Within his arms did him embrace<br>     And kiss'd him very lovingly.<br>     Then in this wise to him spake he,<br>  With grave sweet speech.<br>  <br>                                "Beyond the brine,<br>  Where in the Orient first the sign<br>     Of dawn upon the sky is set,--<br>     In that sweet clime where men forget<br>  The winter, and the summer lies<br>  So lovingly upon the skies,<br>     That of a truth the very night<br>     Is lucent and the cruel sprite<br>  Of darkness never wholly hides<br>  The flowers, but aye some light abides,<br>     Wherefore men call it morning-land,--<br>     A fair and stately house doth stand,<br>  Wherein, by help of God His grace,<br>  Unto my lot it fell to place<br>     That holy token of the Lord,<br>     That He to mortals did afford<br>  Awhile on earth to look upon<br>  For consolation; but anon,<br>     Moved to slow anger by their sin<br>     And stubborn wickedness, within<br>  His mystery He did withdraw<br>  The blessèd thing: but yet the law<br>     Of that sad doom He temperèd--<br>     Of His great grace and kindlihead--<br>  With mercy.  For it was ordain'd<br>  That of one kept himself unstain'd<br>     And pure from every lust and sin,<br>     A virgin, he should surely win<br>  And come to taste of that sweet food<br>  Of the Redemeer's flesh and blood.<br>     And unto me such grace was given<br>     That of all champions that have striven<br>  I have been chosen from the rest<br>  For winning of the Holy Quest;<br>     Since that, as in the Writ we read,<br>     God of the humblest may indeed<br>  Be pleased to make His instrument,<br>  Even unto me that joy was sent,<br>     Surpassing all that of old time<br>     Is told for us in minstrel's rhyme<br>  Of Heaven's mercy: and, God wot,<br>  Were passèd o'er Sir Lancelot<br>     And sweet Sir Tristam, that again<br>     The world shall never of those twain<br>  Behold the like, such debonair<br>  And perfect gentle knights they were.<br>  <br>     "Wherefore to God it seemèd fit<br>     That a fair dwelling over it<br>  Should for its safe keeping be built:<br>  And that no breath of sin or guilt<br>     Might there approach, there was enroll'd<br>     A band of knight, in whom the gold<br>  Of virtue had been smelted out<br>  And purified from sin and doubt<br>     By toil and venture perilous.<br>     And in that high and holy house<br>  In goodly fellowship they dwell,<br>  Until to God it seemeth well--<br>     For long good service done--to call<br>     One of the brethren from the thrall<br>  Of earthly life, and with His blest<br>  In Paradise to give him rest.<br>     Wherefore, when one is call'd away,<br>     It is ordain'd that from the grey<br>  Of the sad world another knight--<br>  To fill his place who, benedight,<br>     Has won the guerdon of his strife--<br>     Be chosen out, to cast off life<br>  And with much labour and much pain<br>  Be purified from earthly stain<br>     And tried with woe.  If he endure<br>     And from the furnace come out pure<br>  Of sin and lusting, he shall stand<br>  For the dead brother in the band<br>     Angelical, and shall be set<br>     With those that, pure of earthly fret,<br>  Do guard the shrine miraculous.<br>  <br>  "In such a wise enrollèd was<br>     Sir Percivale; and Lohengrin<br>     By like adventuring did win<br>  Among the holy knights to sit;<br>  And many more of whom ye wit.<br>     And lately it the Lord hath pleased<br>     That yet another should be eased<br>  Of his long service and preferr'd<br>  Among the angels to be heard<br>     And scent the breath of heaven's rosen.<br>     And in his stead hast thou been chosen<br>  In much hard strife to be assay'd<br>  And for Christ's service fitting made.<br>     Wherefore this venture has been given<br>     To thee, in which thou now hast striven<br>  So wonder-well, that thou mightst win<br>  To purge thyself of earthly sin.<br>     And having in good sooth prevail'd<br>     Against all dangers that assail'd<br>  Thee and this garden's purity,<br>  There is great bliss ordain'd for thee;<br>     For that thy name shall be enroll'd<br>     Among those knights in ward that hold<br>  The blessed Grail; and thou with me<br>  Beyond the billows of the sea<br>     Shalt come to where that house is fair<br>     Withouten any pain or care,<br>  And shalt awhile taste heaven's bliss,<br>  And on thy mouth shalt have the kiss<br>     Of Christ the Lord, that doth assoil<br>     All weariness of earthly toil<br>  And gives unto all sorrows peace<br>  Undying."<br>  <br>                                So the strain did cease<br>     Of his sweet speaking, and awhile<br>     The very sweetness of his smile<br>  Did hinder Floris from reply:<br>  And eke the thought of bliss so nigh<br>     His lips and all the ravishment<br>     Of promise that he did prevent<br>  In his imagining and lack<br>  Of words for utterance held back<br>     His tongue from speaking anything.<br>     But Galahad for answering<br>  Stay'd not, but, with a doubled grace<br>  Of sweet assurance in his face,<br>     Began to say, in very deed,<br>     That presently there was great need<br>  They should withouten more delay<br>  Towards the dawning take their way,<br>     For many a mile the voyage was<br>     And for great distance tedious.<br>  <br>  Then Floris said to him, "Fair knight,<br>  That in whole armour of pure white<br>     Dost serve God in all chastity,<br>     I pri'thee, lightly show to me<br>  How we may gain that distant land<br>  That by the rising sun is scann'd,--<br>     Since neither boat is here nor had?"<br>  <br>     Whereat no word spake Galahad<br>  But with his hand the sign he made,<br>  That makes all evil things afraid<br>     And compasses all good about<br>     With armour against sin and doubt;<br>  And straightway with the holy sign<br>  A white cross in the air did shine<br>     A second, as for answering;<br>     And then the stream's soft murmuring<br>  Grew louder to the sweep of waves<br>  Along the reed-crests and the glaives<br>     Of rushes, and its silver thread<br>     Into a river's mightihead<br>  Was stretch'd; and on the stream did float<br>  The silver wonder of a boat,<br>     Gold-keel'd and fair with silken sails,<br>     Such boat as, in old Eastern tales,<br>  The genii bring at the command<br>  Of some enchanter's magic wand.<br>     And on the prow of cymophane--<br>     Translucent as the pearly wane<br>  Of that fair star that rules the night,<br>  With an internal glory bright--<br>     The milk-white holy bird did sit<br>     And spread soft pinions over it,<br>  That flutter'd with desire of flight.<br>  <br>  Therein stepp'd Galahad, Christ's knight;<br>     And after him did Floris come<br>     At beckoning, wholly dazed and dumb<br>  With wonders of that wondrous time.<br>  And as into the stern did climb<br>     The valiant knight, the soft sweet wind<br>     That 'mid the blossom'd trees was twined,<br>  Ceased from its disport in the flowers<br>  And leafage of those magic bowers,<br>     And with such strong yet gentle stress<br>     Within the silken sails did press<br>  Towards the dawning, that the keel<br>  Slid through the waters blue as steel<br>     As swiftly as the morning sun<br>     Shears through the mists when night is done<br>  And day is golden in the sky.<br>  And as it through the lymph did fly<br>     Of that enchanted rivulet,<br>     The golden keel to song did fret<br>  The thronging currents, and the ring<br>  Of murmurous water-notes did sing<br>     And ripple in the diamond deeps,<br>     Such music as the West wind sweeps<br>  From out the harps of Fairyland,<br>  When elves are met on some sweet strand<br>     Of Broceliaund or Lyonesse,<br>     For revel and for wantonness.<br>  <br>  On all sides round them as they went<br>  The dim grey woods were sad and spent<br>     With weariness of winter-time,<br>     And in the fields the rugged rime<br>  Held all things in the sleep of death,<br>  Stern white, and void of living breath;<br>     And with the weary weight of snow<br>     The laden boughs were bent and low.<br>  But in their sails a breath there blew<br>  Of April zephyrs, and there drew<br>     Unto their course a summer cloud<br>     With scents of flowers and birdsongs strow'd;<br>  And echoings of July woods--<br>  When in the green the bluebell broods--<br>     Were thick and sweet about their way,<br>     And ever round the boat's prow lay<br>  The scent of grass-swaths newly mown;<br>  And wildflowers in gold grain and brown<br>     Waved in the sweet dream-haunted air.<br>  <br>     So went they,--while the night was bare<br>  Of sound or breath to break the sleep<br>  Of winter,--through the woodlands deep,<br>     And past the well-remember'd plains<br>     And towns and meadows, where the lanes<br>  And streets were hush'd with winter-time,--<br>  And saw no creature on the rime,<br>     Save some stray sheep shut out from fold<br>     Or wolf, that from his forest hold<br>  Was by hard hunger forced to seek<br>  Scant prey upon the moorlands bleak.<br>  <br>     So ever without cease they sped<br>     Above that swift sweet river's bed;<br>  And truly, as the golden morn<br>  From out the dim grey mists was born<br>     And all things 'gan to wake from sleep,<br>     They heard the silver rush and sweep<br>  Of waves upon a pebbled shore;<br>  And gliding past the meadows frore,<br>     They came to where the river's tide<br>     Was fleck'd with foam, and far and wide<br>  The main, as far as eye could see,<br>  Slept in a sweet serenity.<br>  <br>     Far out to seaward fled their boat,<br>     Across the wild white flowers that float<br>  And blossom on the azure leas;<br>  And swiftly as the culver flees<br>     Among the trees with shadow twined,<br>     They left the frozen fields behind,<br>  And saw the spangled foam divide<br>  The firmament on every side.<br>  <br>     The golden calm of summer seas<br>     Was there, and eke the July breeze<br>  That waves upon the silver foam,<br>  When in the azure heaven's dome<br>     The sign of summer-prime is set:<br>     And still no winds opposed they met,<br>  Nor break of billows in their way;<br>  But through the dancing ripples' play<br>     The shallop sped towards the dawn,<br>     As by some starry influence drawn<br>  Over the ridges of the main<br>  Unstirr'd and clear.  And still the rain<br>     Of blossoms fell about the stem,<br>     And still sweet odours breathed on them<br>  Of rose and jasmine, and the song<br>  Of birds about the sail was strong.<br>  <br>     So over silver seas they went,<br>     And heaven, wide-eyed for wonderment,<br>  Hung o'er them open blue the while,<br>  As though all nature were asmile<br>     To see the lovely way they made:<br>     And ever round the sharp keel play'd<br>  The fretted lacework of the foam,<br>  And through the jewell'd deeps did roam<br>     Great golden fish, and corals red<br>     Waved in the dim sweet goodlihead<br>  Of that clear blue; and through the wave<br>  The shells of many a rich cave<br>     Were visible, wherein the sea<br>     Held in a sweet security<br>  Treasures of pearl and lovely gold,<br>  That eye of man might ne'er behold<br>     Until the main should leave its bed;<br>     And over all the deeps was shed<br>  A glancing play of emerald light,<br>  So that the unembarrass'd sight<br>     Pierced through the cool sweet mystery<br>     Of folded billows, and the eye<br>  Was free in shadows jewel-clear.<br>  Nor was there anything of fear<br>     For them in lapse of hyaline<br>     Or silver breakers of the brine;<br>  Nor in the crystals of the air<br>  Was anything but blithe and fair,<br>     Sweet winds and glitter of fair birds,<br>     Whose song was sweeter than sweet words<br>  Between the pauses of a kiss,<br>  When lovers meet in equal bliss.<br>  <br>     So many a day they sail'd and long,<br>     Lull'd by the breezes' flower-sweet song<br>  And pipe of jewel-birds that went<br>  Above them, fair to ravishment;<br>     Until, one morn, athwart the lift<br>     Of blue was visible a rift<br>  Of purple mountain; and a spire<br>  Of amethyst rose ever higher<br>     Into the sapphire firmament.<br>     And drawing nigh, they saw where blent<br>  Its silver currents with the blue<br>  Of that bright ocean, blithe to view,<br>     A fair clear river that outpour'd<br>     Its waters 'twixt soft green of sward<br>  And slope of flower-besprinkled banks,<br>  Where rushes stood in arching ranks,<br>     Tipt with a jewel of fair flower<br>     As blue as is the morning hour,<br>  When in the golden prime of May<br>  The sweet dawn blends into the day.<br>  <br>     The swift keel slid between the rows<br>     Of ripples,--as a steed that knows<br>  The road of some familiar place,--<br>  And past the bubbled foamy race<br>     Of eddies, through the sapphire cleft<br>     Of that bright pass, and quickly left<br>  The billows of the sea behind,<br>  As on that goodly stream the wind<br>     Did urge it far into the land.<br>     Surely was never kingdom spann'd<br>  On earth by river such as this,<br>  Where ever some enchanted bliss<br>     Ran in the ripples, and the stream<br>     With liquid gold and pearl did seem<br>  To glitter.  There is nought more fair<br>  Beneath the regions of the air<br>     Than this same river; nor in all<br>     Birdnotes is aught more musical<br>  Than the delight of its clear flow<br>  Across the pebbles, soft and low.<br>     And in the banks were wondrous things,<br>     All lovely creatures that bear wings;<br>  And every precious thing of green,<br>  And flower of gold and jewell'd sheen,<br>     Was there in such a perfect shape,<br>     Its essence must full needs escape<br>  The grasp of my poor minstrelsy.<br>  The very grass was fair to see<br>     Beyond the fairest flower of earth;<br>     For with the gold of some new birth<br>  It burnt, and was aflame with bright<br>  Sweet gladness.  Very flames of light<br>     The flowers seem'd, zaffiran and blue<br>     And crystal-clear with wonder-dew.<br>  It seem'd their scent so heavenly was,<br>  That into music it must pass<br>     And soar into a perfumed song.<br>     And as the boat was borne along<br>  The golden ripples, in its speed<br>  Dividing many a woven weed,<br>     That with its many-colour'd mesh<br>     Of trailing leaves and flowers did stretch<br>  And wave upon the waters bright,--<br>  Sir Floris, with what prayers he might,<br>     That gracious Galahad besought<br>     That from his lips he might be taught<br>  What was that river and that realm,<br>  That all earth's sweets did hide and whelm<br>     In one etern forgetfulness,<br>     And made all joys that men possess<br>  Seem poor and naught with the delight<br>  Of its exceeding lovely might.<br>     And without pausing, Galahad<br>     To him made answer fair and glad.<br>  <br>  "Fair knight, this land through which we pass,<br>  About the city of Sarras<br>     Doth lie; and all the golden plain<br>     Beyond thy vision, for demesne--<br>  By grace and favour of high Heaven--<br>  Unto the Holy Town was given,<br>     Where lies in hold the blessed Grail.--<br>  <br>     "Before from Paradise did fail<br>  Adam and Eva for their sin,<br>  These happy fields and glades within <br>     The golden gates of Eden were<br>     Wherein was nothing but was fair:<br>  And this same river of those four<br>  Was one, that of old times did pour<br>     Blithe waters over all the plain,<br>     When life was young and free from stain,<br>  And angels walk'd upon the earth.<br>  And (for their flow) came never dearth<br>     Of kindly fruits nor any drought<br>     Of summer-time the place about;<br>  Nor for the warmth of their clear flood<br>  Might winter nip the flowery bud<br>     Of the perpetual spring, that rain'd<br>     Fresh blossoms there; nor ever waned<br>  The balms of summer in the air,<br>  But evermore the place was fair<br>     With all May-sweets and summer-spells.<br>     And still,-although the cloister'd dells<br>  Of the lost garden no more stand<br>  Upon the peace of the fair land,--<br>     Around its precincts, as of old,<br>     A silver stream with sands of gold<br>  Flows ever, which no foot of man,<br>  Or eye, without Christ's leave, can span;<br>     Of all the four the only one<br>     That still with murmurous waves doth run<br>  In the old channel.  Very fair<br>  Its marges are with all things rare;<br>     And over all the land is strown<br>     Thick bdellium and the onyx-stone."<br>  <br>  And many another wondrous thing<br>  Unto Sir Floris, listening,<br>     Spake Galahad of that fair land,<br>     That eye of man hath never scann'd,<br>  Save he have won to Christ His grace.<br>  And and as he spoke, came on apace<br>     The tender day, and gilded all<br>     The ripples; and the golden ball<br>  Of the sweet sun rose high in heaven;<br>  And unto every thing was given<br>     New ravishment and new delight<br>     Of very waking.  Fairer sight<br>  Saw mortal never (nor indeed<br>  So fair within our earthly need<br>     Is compass'd) than the morning hour<br>     That open'd into full sweet flower<br>  With many a rosy flush and rain<br>  Of golden sunlight over plain<br>     And mead, and many a tender shade<br>     Kiss'd into warmth--that in green glade<br>  Lay waiting for the frolic light--<br>  And changed to fleecy gold the white<br>     Of dawn-clouds over hill and wold.<br>     It was so gracious to behold<br>  The day in that sweet Paradise,<br>  There is no man with mortal eyes<br>     Could drink its beauty wholly in,<br>     For dust of care and mirk of sin<br>  That hide much loveliness from men.<br>  <br>  And Floris ever and again<br>     Was dumb with awe of much delight<br>     And wonderment; as with swift flight<br>  The boat sped through the flowers that shone<br>  With blazon'd gold and blue upon<br>     That magic river of a dream,<br>  He sat and stored the influence<br>  Of the lush balms within his sense,<br>     And watch'd the ripples all agleam<br>  With jewels, and the constant smile<br>  Of the sweet sunlight.  And the while<br>     The songs of his birds co-ordinate<br>     And zephyrs with a peace so great<br>  And sweet upon his soul did seize,<br>  And whiles his spirit had such ease<br>     In that sweet speech of Galahad,<br>     He needs forgot that aught of sad<br>  Or dreary in this life is set,<br>  Or weariness of earthly fret;<br>     And did, without a backward glance,<br>     Yield up himself into the trance<br>  Of that new joy.<br>  <br>                                So sped they on<br>  Towards the orient: and anon,--<br>     Whenas the noon was borne along<br>     The midmost heaven, to the song<br>  Triumphal of the joyous choir<br>  Of birds and breezes, ever higher<br>     Soaring in one sweet antiphon,--<br>     There rose in the sweet sky--upon<br>  The fair broad hem of woven gold,<br>  That marged with many a fleecy fold<br>     The sapphire-chaliced firmament--<br>     A glitter of tall spires, that brent<br>  With an unearthly radiance;<br>  And many a jewel-colour'd lance<br>     Of belfry pierced the golden air<br>     On the horizon: and there bare<br>  The wind to them a strain of song<br>  Ineffable, the stream along--<br>     Faint for great distance--that for joy<br>     And triumph over earth's annoy<br>  With such a rapturous sweetness smote<br>  On Floris, he could neither note<br>     The kingdom's varied loveliness<br>     Nor the sweet antiphonal stress<br>  Of winds and birds and rivulet,<br>  But it alone could hear, nor let<br>     Himself from striving up to it;<br>     For with its melody was knit<br>  About his soul an influence<br>  So strong, it seem'd his every sense<br>     Must press towards it.  And at last,<br>     For ecstasy he would have cast<br>  Himself headlong into the stream,<br>  That therewithal, as he did deem,<br>     He might the swiftlier win toward<br>     That wondrous singing and the ward<br>  Of that bright town miraculous.<br>  But Galahad the good knight was <br>     Mindful of him, and by his arm<br>     Withholding him therefrom, did charm<br>  His soul with such sweet words, that he<br>  Must for a while contented be<br>     To wait the progress of the boat,<br>     That very speedily did float,<br>  God wot, across the ripples' race,<br>  To where the turrets of the place<br>     Were clear.<br>  <br>                                And so they came at last<br>     To where the running river pass'd<br>  From the long lapse of pleasant wood<br>  And meadow with enchantments strew'd<br>     Of flowers and sun-gold, and were ware<br>     Of the bright town that all the air<br>  With towers and pinnacles did fill,<br>  Set on the slope of a soft hill,<br>     That in the sun wore one clear hue<br>     Of purple blending into blue,<br>  Most like a great sweet amethyst.<br>  <br>  And now the gunwale softly kiss'd<br>     The golden shore; and, thick with gem<br>     And coral, round the entering stem<br>  Was wrinkled up the glittering sand.<br>  Then Galahad upon the strand<br>     Stepp'd lightly out; and as his feet<br>     Upon the grainèd gold did meet<br>  Of the rich shingle, there was borne<br>  To them the noise of a blown horn,<br>     That was as if a warder blew<br>     To challenge, from some tower of view<br>  Within the amber-gated town;<br>  Wherefrom to them it floated down<br>     And fill'd the air with echoings<br>     So sweet, there is no bird that sings<br>  Could find such music in his throat<br>  Melodious.  And as the note<br>     Of welcome swell'd  and waned around<br>     The hollows of the hills,--unwound<br>  From his mail'd breast Sir Galahad<br>  A silver horn he thereon had<br>     In its white baldrick, and therein<br>     Breathing, its hollow bell did win<br>  Unto so sweet an answering blast,<br>  It seem'd to Floris that at last<br>     He heard the trumps angelical.<br>     Then at the silver clarion's call<br>  The beryl gates were open'd wide<br>  Of the fair town; and on the side<br>     Of the soft hill there was to them<br>     Made visible--upon the hem<br>  Of woven grass with blue-bells strew'd<br>  And asphodels--a multitude<br>     Of holy knights, that down the sward<br>     In a bright painted pageant pour'd,<br>  With many a waving pennoncel<br>  Of gold and azure; and the swell<br>     Of clarions, co-ordinate<br>     To mystic harmonies, did wait,<br>  With cadences most grave and sweet,<br>  Upon the rhythm of their feet.<br>     So goodly were they of aspèct<br>     And in such pictured raiment deck'd<br>  Of say and samite, there is none,<br>  Minstrel or bard, beneath the sun,<br>     That could have sung of their array<br>     As it befits to sing it,--nay<br>  Not even he who many a day<br>  In Fäerie enchanted lay<br>     And learnt full many a year and long<br>     The cadences of elfin song,<br>  True Thomas; nor that couthliest wight<br>  In gramarye, that Merlin hight.<br>  <br>     Full bright their arms and lucent were<br>     And of a sheen so wonder-fair,<br>  The sun seem'd of a nobler kind<br>  To glitter, when his beamings shined<br>     Upon the silver-mirror'd mail.<br>     And at the sight of them did fail<br>  Sir Floris' courage, that till now<br>  Had never seen thing high enow<br>     To give him pause; for there did come<br>     So strange a fear on him, that dumb<br>  And cold he grew, and haply might<br>  Have swoon'd away for sheer affright<br>     Of wonder and great reverence<br>     That lay upon his every sense.<br>  Indeed, awhile the blood did leave<br>  Its courses and great awe did weave<br>     Strange terrors in him; and with pain<br>     And fear despiteous, he was fain<br>  To hide his visage from the might<br>  Of that much brightness.<br>  <br>                                Then that knight<br>     Sir Galahad laid hands on him,<br>     And quickly freed him from the grim<br>  Sad grasp of that unreal fear,<br>  And bade him that of right good cheer<br>     He should become, for knighthood's sake,<br>     And for his honour comfort take<br>  And new stout heart, for shame it was<br>  And despite, one so valorous<br>     And bold in arms should faint and fail,<br>     Where he most surely should prevail,<br>  'Midst those that now his comrades were<br>  And fellow-knights: and with much fair<br>     Discourse did win him from affright.<br>     So that at last he dared the sight<br>  Of those fair knights, and saw they gazed<br>  Right courteously on him and praised<br>     His hard-won victory.   So he took<br>     New heart, and with assurèd look<br>  Leapt out upon the jewell'd sand:<br>  And as the twain were come to land,<br>     From those knights all so sweet a sound<br>     Of songful greeting did resound,<br>  The blue of heaven could never tire<br>  Of answering; and from many a lyre<br>     And cithern the alternate joy<br>     Of harpings join'd in sweet alloy<br>  Its silver with that golden song.<br>  <br>  So Floris was among that throng<br>     Of knights received, with many a kiss<br>     And glad embracement: nor, I wis,<br>  Fail'd Galahad that he should name<br>  Each knight that to the greeting came.<br>     To him was Titurel made known,<br>     And Percivale, to whom was shown--<br>  With Bors--such grace of God most high,<br>  By reason of much purity,<br>     That they alone with Galahad<br>     Upon the earthly questing had<br>  The blessed vision of the Grail:<br>  Nor Lohengrin to him did fail;<br>     And may another noble knight<br>  Of fabled prowess and approved<br>  In gentilesse and all Christ loved,<br>     Did there rejoice him with his sight.<br>  <br>     So, for the meed of his good fight,<br>  Into the wonder-town they bare<br>  Sir Floris,--wherein many a rare<br>     Delight to him appointed was.<br>  <br>     Bright was the place and glorious<br>  With glory of the abiding love<br>  Of God and Christ, that is above<br>     All splendours marvellous and fair;<br>     And luminous its ramparts were<br>  With pearls and rubies constellate<br>  And diamonds into such state<br>     And harmony as, save in heaven,<br>     Unto no place or thing is given<br>  To wear or look on: such a blaze<br>  Of joy was there, without amaze;<br>     For all was gracious and sweet<br>     With Christ His grace.  The very feet<br>  That fell upon the jewell'd stones<br>  Compell'd them to such silver tones<br>     Of music, and the ruffled air<br>     Was stirr'd to harmonies so fair,<br>  And, for mere passage through the place,<br>  Was won to such a subtle grace<br>     Of perfume, that therein to be<br>     And move, was one long ecstasy:<br>  And there the dole of earth and stress<br>  Of hope unfill'd and weariness<br>     Was purged, and life was one delight<br>     Of perfect function, by the might<br>  Unfailing of the doubtless soul;<br>  And every act and thought was whole<br>     In strifeless àccord.  If one spoke,<br>     The hinder'd voice no longer broke<br>  Into harsh sadness, spent and wried<br>  With weary effort, but did glide<br>     Into an unconstrain'd consent<br>     Of harmony and ravishment<br>  Unstressful; and the every geste<br>  Was with like subtle grace possess'd,<br>     And every faculty was cast<br>     In symmetry, what time one pass'd<br>  The portals of the place, and heard<br>  The echoes of his feet that stirr'd<br>     The holy quiet.<br>  <br>                                So the spell<br>     Of the charm'd place on Floris fell<br>  Transfiguringly, as the wide<br>  Gold-trellised leaves on either side<br>     Swung back for him: there came a change<br>     Upon his senses, and a strange<br>  Sweet ease of life, as if the soul,<br>  Way-worn and rusted with the dole<br>     And fret of earth, were softly riven<br>     From him, and its stead were given<br>  To him a new and perfect one,<br>  In a whole body as the sun<br>     Lucent, and worthy for the seat<br>     Of the fair spirit.<br>  <br>                                Up the street<br>  Gold-paven and with chrysolite<br>  And jacinth marged, they brought the knight,<br>     Past many a goodly hostelry<br>     And many a dwelling fair to see,<br>  Unto a portal sculptured all<br>  With handiwork angelical,<br>     In stories of the love of Christ,<br>     And all the time it hath sufficed<br>  To win sad living to much ease;--<br>  And passing through with harmonies<br>     Of choral song, they came unto<br>     A vaulted courtyard, stretching through<br>  A cloister'd vista to fair halls<br>  Of alabaster, where the walls<br>     With many a colour'd crystal shone<br>     Of jewell'd casement; and thereon<br>  The questing of the Holy Grail,<br>  In many a wonder-lovely tale,<br>     Was with bright gold and wonderment<br>     Of colour'd jewel-fretwork blent<br>  To harmony, depicturèd.<br>  And there, in truth, Sir Floris read,--<br>     Beside much other venturing,<br>     And many another goodly thing<br>  Achieved in service of the Lord,--<br>  The fight that he with his good sword<br>     Had in the wonder-garden fought.<br>     Nor, therewithal, was missing aught<br>  Of all that did that night befall<br>  Unto him: but upon the wall<br>     Was in bright colours pictured forth<br>     The tale of all his knightly worth<br>  And service.<br>  <br>                                Little strange it is<br>  If much he wonder'd was at this,<br>     And could for wonder scarce believe<br>     His eyes, that any should achieve<br>  So vast a work and of such grace<br>  And splendour in so scant a space<br>     Of time.  But Lohengrin besought<br>     Him very fairly that of nought<br>  He saw he should be wonderèd,<br>  Nor any venture have in dread;<br>     Since that to that high Lord, that there<br>     Did reign, all wonders easy were<br>  And wonderless; nor of His grace<br>  Was anything in all that place<br>     That might avail for any fear<br>     Or doubt, but rather to give cheer<br>  And love and confidence was fit,<br>  So sweet a peace did dwell in it<br>     Of amity and holiness.<br>  <br>     Then with slow feet they did address<br>  Their further steps,--by a long aisle<br>  Of cloister'd pearl, wherethrough the smile<br>     Of sunlight filter'd lingeringly<br>     And lay in one sweet soften'd sea<br>  Of gold upon the silver mail,--<br>  Towards the temple of the Grail.<br>     And in a vestibule, that was<br>     Thereto adjacent, did they pause<br>  And in fair garments clad the knight,<br>  With silver radiant and white.<br>     And then into an armoury<br>     They led him, very fair to see<br>  With noble weapons, all arow<br>  Against the wainscot.  There a snow<br>     Of plumes upon his crest they bound,<br>     And from the swords that hung around<br>  A goodly blade was given him,<br>  That to the sound of many a hymn<br>     And many a golden litany,<br>     Had in the glorious armoury<br>  Of highest heaven forgèd been:<br>  So trenchant was it and so keen,--<br>     Being in celestial fires assay'd<br>     And in strange dews of heaven made<br>  Attemper'd,--there might none withstand<br>  The thunderstroke of that good brand,<br>     Except his bosom armour'd were<br>     With equal virtue.  Then the fair<br>  Graven presentment of a dove<br>  With eyes of gold ws set above<br>     His helm,--most like the fowl that brought<br>     Him to the garden where he wrought<br>  Such deeds of arms; and on the field<br>  Coerulean of his virgin shield<br>     There was a like resemblant set,<br>     That men might know him, when they met<br>  In sharp sword-play or battle-throng.<br>  <br>  Then, with a ripple of sweet song,<br>     The golden doors were backward roll'd,<br>     That in sweet mystery did fold<br>  The holy place; and Floris came<br>  Into a hall, where with a flame<br>     Of jewell'd light the air was gilt;<br>     And therewithin the walls were built<br>  Of that clear sapphire jewelry <br>  That can in nowise elsewhere be<br>     Save for the pavement of the sky<br>     And for the throne of God most high.<br>  And under foot the floor was bright<br>  With one clear topaz, as the light<br>     Of the sweet sun in hue.  Above<br>     There was y-sprad a flower-bell roof<br>  Of that sweet colour of deep blue<br>  One in the spring may chance to view,<br>     When in the golden-threaded moss<br>     The deep wood-dells are odorous<br>  With violets and the cluster'd bells<br>  Of bee-loved hyacinths, or else<br>     The deep clear colours pers and inde<br>     Of wild-flowers in the gold corn twined<br>  With many a tassel of bright blue,<br>  When summer in the skies is new.--<br>     And in the bell were golden lights,<br>     Most like the tender eye-delights<br>  Of the gold kingcups in the green,<br>  That in quaint wise were set between<br>     The fretted azure of the dome.<br>     And therethrough did meteors roam,<br>  As 'twere in truth the very heaven,<br>  And the sweet symbols of the seven<br>     Great angels that do rule the skies<br>     Where therein jewell'd.  In such wise<br>  The varied lights were mixt and blent<br>  With those that heavenward were sent<br>     From walls and pavement,--all the air<br>     Was with that lightsomeness most fair<br>  And tender fill'd, that in the May<br>  Is weft about the sweet young day,<br>     When whiles it seems the sky is dight<br>     With one great primrose of soft light,<br>  Most pure and tender.  On the ground<br>  There stood fair statues all around,<br>     Deep-set in woven flowers and green<br>     Of lavish leafage, stretch'd between<br>  Tall carven pillars of that bright<br>  Jewel that chrysoberyl hight,<br>     And many another precious stone.<br>     Nor there were images alone<br>  Of holy things, as one might deem;<br>  But eke full many a lovely dream<br>     Of tender love and constancy<br>     Was in clear gold and ivory<br>  With loving hand made manifest.<br>  For there was nothing there confess'd<br>     Of sin or wantonness in love,--<br>     As ancient doctors teach, that prove<br>  All pleasant things that are, to be<br>  Unloved of God.  And verily<br>  Sir Floris wonder'd there to see<br>     The histories that makers tell<br>     Of Parisate and Floridelle,<br>  The tale of Tristan and Ysolde,<br>     Of Lancelot and Guenevere,<br>  And many another tale of old,<br>     That men on earth do dully lere<br>  That we should count accurst and ill:<br>  But there depictured were they still,<br>     In very piteous fashion told;<br>     And on the wall in words of gold<br>  Was writ this legend, <i> "Quiconque aime<br>  Complait a Dieu en pechié mesme."</i> <br>  <br>     And while Sir Floris stood and gazed<br>     Upon the statues,--much amazed<br>  At all that he did hear and see<br>  Within the temple,--suddenly<br>     There was a fluted singing heard,<br>     As of some wonder-lovely bird.<br>  And then one took him by the hand,<br>  And led him where a gold screen spann'd<br>     The topaz paved work of the floor.<br>  <br>     Then was he ware of a high door,<br>  That with much wonderwork of gold<br>  And unknown metals was enscroll'd<br>     In many a trellis of fair flowers<br>     And fronds enough fair for the bowers<br>  Of Paradise; and in the leaves<br>  There sat a bird, that was as sheaves<br>     Of ripen'd corn in hue, and sang--<br>     That therewithal the temple rang--<br>  Of unknown glories of the May,<br>  Therein where life is one long day<br>     Of spring and never change is there,<br>     Nor any sadness in the air.<br>  And as he sang, the golden gate<br>  Swung open slowly, and the great<br>     Sweet hollow of a pure white pearl<br>     Lay clear behind that golden merle,<br>  Into a chamber fashionèd.<br>  <br>  There was an altar built and spread<br>     With tapestry of silver white,<br>  Woven with lilies; and thereon<br>  Was set a chalice, out of one<br>     Great emerald moulded,--with samite,<br>  The colour of the heart's best blood,<br>  Enshrouded; and thereover stood<br>  A great white cross and fill'd the air<br>  With living radiance, as it were<br>     A sculptured work of very light.<br>  <br>     Then with the wonder of the sight<br>  Was Floris fill'd; and for great awe<br>  And reverence of all he saw<br>     Within the pearl, straightway he fell<br>     Upon his knees.  But Titurel<br>  With counsel very fair and wise<br>  Required of him that he should rise<br>     From off the ground and without fear<br>     Unto the altar should draw near<br>  And for an offering thereon<br>  Should lay those blossoms he had won<br>     In parlous fight, and much duresse,<br>     That of their blended goodliness<br>  And eke their perfume's ravishment,<br>  There might a sacrifice be sent,<br>     To God and Christ acceptable.<br>  <br>     And now a wondrous thing befell,<br>  (God grant us all the like to see);<br>  For as Sir Floris reverently<br>     Upon the silver cloth did lay<br>     The holy flowers (that, sooth to say<br>  Were bright of bloom and sweet of scent,<br>  Unfaded, as when first they sprent<br>     The greensward) and withdrawing thence<br>     A little space, in reverence<br>  The issue did await,--there came<br>  A hand all shapen out of flame,<br>     And from the emerald of the cup<br>     The crimson samite lifted up;<br>  And as this thing was done, there fell--<br>  As 'twere from out the midmost bell--<br>     A light that through the emerald sped<br>     And mingled with the holy bread;<br>  And with the light, came one that pass'd<br>  Thought-swift athwart the air and cast<br>     Himself into the cup,--as 'twere<br>     The angel of a child,--most fair<br>  And awful.  Wherewithal thereout<br>  There went a fire the place about,<br>     And fill'd the temple with its breath,<br>     Wherein was neither hurt nor death;<br>  But of its contact there were given<br>  To Floris very balms of heaven<br>     For consecration; and to eat<br>     There was vouchsafed him food so sweet<br>  And goodly such as no man knows.<br>  <br>  Then from the chaliced gem there rose<br>     The semblance of a face, that was<br>     With such a splendour glorious<br>  And awful--and withal as mild<br>  And tender as a little child--<br>     There is no bard can sing of it<br>     As it befitteth, save he sit<br>  (And hardly then) among the choirs,<br>  That to the throb of golden lyres<br>     Do praise God ever night and day<br>     With music such as no man may.--<br>  There is but one of woman born<br>  By whom such aspect can be worn<br>     Of perfect love and perfect awe<br>     Commingled.<br>  <br>                                And when Floris saw<br>  The glory of the eyes, and knew<br>  The holy love, that like a dew<br>     From out their radiant deeps was shed<br>     Upon his soul,--for very dread<br>  Of ravishment he could not gaze<br>  Upon their light, but with amaze<br>     And wonderment of joy was fain<br>     Down to the earth to bend again<br>  His face: but ere he ceased to see<br>  The vision, of a surety<br>     It was made known to him (although<br>     He wist not how he came to know)<br>  That heavenly face no other's was<br>  Than that same Lord's who erst did pass<br>     Before his vision in the green<br>     Of the fair garden, all beseen<br>  With glittering hair.<br>  <br>                                Then as he knelt,<br>  Unseeing, suddenly he felt<br>     Upon his mouth a burning kiss,<br>     That with such sharp unearthly bliss<br>  His soul did kindle into flame<br>  Of ravishment, the wayworn frame<br>     Could not for frailty sustain<br>     The rapturous ecstatic pain<br>  Of that strange joyance, nor the spright<br>  Embodied, 'gainst the fierce delight<br>     Endure of that unearthly boon;<br>     And so for bliss he fell aswoon,<br>  And heard therein a great sweet voice,<br>  That bade him fear not, but rejoice,<br>     For Christ the Lord his lips had kiss'd;<br>     And therewithal the Eucharist<br>  Was borne into his mouth, with sound<br>  Of harps angelic all around<br>     Soft-smitten; nor therefore did break<br>     His charmèd sleep.<br>  <br>                                Then did one speak<br>  To him as in the trance he lay,<br>  And with a murmurous voice did say,<br>     That for the service of that Lord, <br>     To whom was sacred now his sword,<br>  It was ordain'd that for a space<br>  He should return unto his place<br>     Upon the earth, and in all things<br>     That life on earth to mortals brings,<br>  Should for his Master's honour strive,<br>  Until the order'd time arrive<br>     When God should set him free from soil<br>     And weariness of earthly toil.<br>  And there was given him a sign<br>  When it should please the Lord Divine<br>     To make His will beneficent<br>     Patent to him,--there should be sent,<br>  Twice more before the period set<br>  For his release from earthly fret,<br>     To him the self-same silver dove,<br>     The holy symbol of the love<br>  Of Christ and of His chivalry.<br>  And it was told him that when he<br>     Of the white messenger had wit, <br>     He should leave all and follow it:<br>  For when it should of him be seen<br>  Anew, as it of late had been,<br>     He should be ware that God had need<br>     Of him elsewhere--in very deed--<br>  Upon the earth, and will'd essay<br>  His service yet within the way<br>     Of living: but what time he heard <br>     The thrice-said summons, and the bird<br>  Miraculous unto him came<br>  A third time, in the holy name,--<br>     He should, in following, be freed<br>     From toil and labour and the need<br>  And weariness of day and night,<br>  And from the knowledge and the sight<br>     Of men be ravish'd, to abide<br>     In that fair town beatified,<br>  And serve the Grail, till it seem'd fit<br>  Unto the Lord that he should sit<br>     Among the blest in Paradise<br>     And praise Him ever.<br>  <br>                                In this wise<br>  It seem'd to Floris that one spoke<br>  To him with soft sweet speech, that broke<br>     His slumber not, as he did lie<br>     In that long swoon; and, suddenly,<br>  The murmur of the speech forsook<br>  His hearing wholly; nor with look<br>     Or ears awhile was anything<br>     Apparent to him, that could bring<br>  The wonders of the holy town<br>  Back to his senses; but the brown<br>     And fleecy-plumaged wings of sleep<br>     Inclosed him wholly.  In a deep<br>  And senseless dream awhile he lay,<br>  Until it seem'd to him the gray<br>     Of night that compass'd him about<br>     Was by a radiance from without<br>  Transmicate, and the fluted song<br>  Of the gold merle again was strong<br>     Upon his hearing.  Then the dim<br>     Gray webs of slumber were from him<br>  Unfolded slowly, and there burst<br>  A golden light on him.  At first<br>     The drowsy cumber on his eyes<br>     Allow'd him not to recognize<br>  The place wherein he was, nor know<br>  Wherefrom the amber-colour'd glow<br>     Of light was borne: but speedily<br>     He was aware that he did lie<br>  Upon his bed, and through the fold<br>  Of silken tapestries the gold<br>     Of the young sun upon his face<br>     Was shed; and past the window-space,<br>  Without the casement, could he see,--<br>  Snow-pure against brown stem and tree,--<br>     The charmèd flowerage of that thorn<br>     That ever on the Christmas morn<br>  Is--for a memory and delight<br>  Of the Lord's birth--with blossoms white<br>     Transfigurate.  And on a spray<br>     There sat a mavis brown and grey,<br>  That sang as if his heart were shed<br>  Into his minstrelsy and fled<br>     On wings of music heavenward,<br>     A sacrifice of song outpour'd<br>  To God most high.<br>  <br>                                Awhile it seem'd<br>  To Floris he had surely dream'd<br>     The coming of the dove to him<br>     And all his strife against the grim<br>  Fierce beasts, and all the after-bliss<br>  And wonderment, and Christ His kiss.<br>     But looking closelier, he was ware<br>     At bed-head of his helm that bare<br>  A silver dove with eyes of gold,<br>  That on the crest did sit and fold<br>     White wings above it; and he knew<br>     The holy semblant on the blue<br>  Of his fair shield, and eke the blade<br>  Celestial, by his harness laid<br>     Naked at bedfood.  So the doubt<br>     Was from his spirit blotted out;<br>  And he was surely certified<br>  That verily he did abide<br>     That wondrous venture, and had known<br>     Awhile the glories that alone<br>  For those that many a toil have dared<br>  In Christ His service, are prepared<br>     Within the city of the Grail,<br>     Wherein is neither pain nor wail,<br>  But ever holiness and peace<br>  And ravishment without surcease,<br>     In very perfectness of rest.<br>  <br>                 *  *  *  *<br>  <br>     So hath Sir Floris found his quest;<br>  And so the tale is told and done,<br>  Of how, before life's rest was won,<br>     The first time unto Floris came<br>     The holy dove, in Lord Christ's name.<br>  <br>  <i> Christmas, 1868</i> <br>
