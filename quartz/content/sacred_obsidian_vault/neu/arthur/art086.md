One was dark,<br> Luxuriant with the beauty of the south,<br> A heart of fire--and this one he forsook.<br> The other slender, tall, with wide gray eyes,<br> Who loved him with a still intensity<br> That made her heart a shrine--to her he clave,<br> And he was faithful to her to the end.<br> And when the poet died, a song was found<br> Which he had writ, of Launcelot and Gawaine;<br> And when the women read it, one cried out:<br> "Where got he Launcelot?  Gawaine I know--<br> He drew that picture from a looking-glass--<br> Sleek, lying, treacherous, golden-tongued Gawaine!"<br> The other, smiling, murmured "Launcelot!"<br>
