align="CENTER">ROBERT BUCHANAN</h2>  </center>  <br>  <br>                 I.<br>  <br>  'Mid fragrant flowers and fairest<br>           The scorpion oft will bide,<br>  And ripest fruits and rarest<br>           The vengeful hornet hide.<br>  O'er Sodom's lake in beauty<br>           The tempting clusters hung;<br>  But plucked, like soot that baleful fruit<br>           It mocked the loathing tongue!<br>  The summer cloud rains fastest<br>           When rainbows brightest shine;<br>  The deadliest draught is couched and quaffed<br>           In cups of choicest wine:<br>  And lawless love, with ecstacy,<br>           Though snatched in bed or bower,<br>  Hath in its honey poison,<br>           A scorpion in its flower!<br>  <br>  *****************************<br>  <br>                 II.<br>  <br>  So thought, I ween, Sir Launcelot,<br>           So thought Queen Guinevere,<br>  When Arthur camped round Garde Joyeuse<br>           To seek his wrong's repair,<br>  And banner broad and banderol<br>           Streamed thick o'er the array<br>  Of knight, and squire, and yeoman,<br>           Beseiged it night and day.<br>  The walls are stout -- the garners<br>           Are full -- and week by week,<br>  In vain by force or famine<br>           To win that tower they seek:<br>  But day by day Sir Launcelot<br>           With gibe and jeer they taunt --<br>  And <i> traitor</i>  hail, and <i> bordeller</i> ,<br>           And hoot him <i> recreant</i> !<br>  <br>                 III.<br>  <br>  "Now Christ me save, Sir Uncle!<br>           This may no more be borne;<br>  But let us out, and yonder rout,<br>           We'll soon abate their scorn!<br>  Like fox that skulks in cover<br>           It shames me here to shield,"<br>  Cried fierce Sir Bors -- "To-morrow<br>           We'll ride us forth a'field --<br>  So redd ye well that crow so loud,<br>           Look to your battle-gear,<br>  For we will stir your slumbers<br>           With prick of lance and spear!"<br>  <br>  *****************************<br>  <br>                 IV.<br>  <br>  And fair it rose that morrow,<br>           Brought in a doleful day;<br>  On braird and bent the blobs besprent<br>           Like drops of diamond lay:<br>  Like darkling sea, the mountains<br>           Heaved in their misty screen,<br>  And Tweed sang soft his morning song<br>           Beneath his shroud unseen.<br>  But when that cloudy curtain rose,<br>           Brave sight it was to see<br>  On plain apost, Sir Arthur's host<br>           Drawn out in battles three:<br>  And on their hinges shrieking<br>           The heavy gates are swung,<br>  And forth thereout, with clang and shout,<br>           Three gallant armies flung!<br>  <br>                 V.<br>  <br>  Their banners wapped and wavered<br>           O'er streams of rushing steel;<br>  And hoarsely brayed the trumpet's blast<br>           Their onset's deadly peal.<br>  Rose shout and cheer, and laughter wild,<br>           And shriek and frenzy-curse,<br>  The glint of glaive, the dint of mace,<br>           The thud of falling horse.<br>  Are helm and hauberk ringing<br>           To swords are smiting keen;<br>  Are battered casque, and cloven shield,<br>           And showers of arrows sheen: --<br>  Now backward, and now forward,<br>           Now swells, now sinks the fray;<br>  Like forest heaves and hollows<br>           Beneath the tempest's sway.<br>  Sir Blamor, and Sir Lionel,<br>           Sir Bors, and Palamede,<br>  That day in battle bore the bell<br>           For deeds of doughtyhede:<br>  For Arthur still, and fierce Gawayne,<br>           Nor heed nor hinder not,<br>  But keep their swords undinted<br>           For only Launcelot.<br>  <br>  *****************************<br>  <br>                 VI.<br>  <br>  And they have pressed him hot and sore,<br>           All round the battle-field;<br>  But ever he their feud forbore,<br>           And kept him with his shield.<br>  Then upspake Lavayne angrily,<br>           Sir Launcelot, think thee well,<br>  Thy nephews twain, are nigh to slain,<br>           Sir Bors and Lionel,<br>  And yet thy most thou sparest still,<br>           Nor slayest them that slay;<br>  But skulk'st like hunted badger,<br>           Or stand'st like boar at bay.<br>  To see thee braved and baited thus,<br>           Puts thine to evil cheer;<br>  The foe but mocks thy mercy,<br>           And counts it all of fear."<br>  <br>  *****************************<br>  <br>                 VII.<br>  <br>  He led him where on sward aswoon<br>           Sir Bors lay  bleeding fast;<br>  All pale for rage grew Launcelot,<br>           And tears for anger brast --<br>  He cheered his steed -- he set his teeth --<br>           He raised  his battle-cry --<br>  And where the death-drift fierceliest drove,<br>           Flashed there his sword on high!<br>  With shout and cheer hath followed him<br>           His gallant chivalry; --<br>  Lavayne, Safyr, and Bellangere,<br>           And Urre of Hungary.<br>  Fought yeoman stout, fought burgher bold,<br>           Each man as he were wood;<br>  Ere even-song, Sir Launcelot<br>           Rode fetlock-deep in blood!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br> <br>
