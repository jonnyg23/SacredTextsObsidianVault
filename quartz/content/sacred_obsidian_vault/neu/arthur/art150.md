And so after upon that to supper."<br> <br> <br>                                          I<br>  "Before you take this Quest," (he said), "in order set,--<br>  Each knight around the Table, --come, sup with me yet;<br>  Come, keep the feast, that after us men never shall forget!"<br> <br>                                          II<br>  Now, round the Table seated, each tall knight in his place,--<br>  Hears noises like to thunder, and sees a light whose rays<br>  Make shine his fellows by him, with brows more bright than day's.<br> <br>                                          III<br>  Not one could speak, for wonder.  Then lo, within the hall<br>  Wrapt round with snow-white samite, the blessed Sancgreal<br>  And sweetest savours filled the board; and meat and drink for all.<br> <br>                                          IV<br>  The mystic Vessel like a gleam went by: it could not stay:<br>  And the knights all fell to feasting, and the vision passed away,<br>  That all shall quest, but few shall find, until the earth's last day.<br> <br>                                          V<br>  And then they fell to babbling, their hands upon their knees,<br>  And babbled of the morrow, and all the joy there is<br>  For them that quest, and ride the lands,  and cross the winter seas.<br> <br>                                          VI<br>  But the tears fell down King Arthur's cheeks, as he sate with his men:<br>  "Ye have set me in great sorrow," said Arthur to them then:<br>  "For oh, I doubt, my fellowship, shall meet no more again!"<br> <br>
