On high,<br>     When midnight set the spaces free,<br>  And brimming stars hung from the sky<br>     Low down, and spilt their jewellery,<br>  <br>  Behind the nightly squandered fire,<br>     Through a dark lattice only seen<br>  By love, a look of rapt desire<br>     Fell from a vision of the Queen.<br>  <br>  From heaven she bent when twilight knit<br>     The dusky air and earth in one;<br>  He saw her like a goddess sit<br>     Enthroned upon the noonday sun.<br>  <br>  In passages of gulfs and sounds,<br>     When wild winds dug the sailor's grave,<br>  When clouds and billows merged their bounds,<br>     And the keel climbed the slippery wave,<br>  <br>  A sweet sigh laced the tempest; nay,<br>     Low at his ear he heard her speak;<br>  Among the hurtling sheaves of spray<br>     Her loosened tresses swept his cheek.<br>  <br>  And in the revelry of death,<br>     If human greed of slaughter cast<br>  Remorse aside, a violet breath,<br>     The incense of her being passed<br>  <br>  Across his soul, and deeply swayed<br>     The fount of pity; o'er the strife<br>  He curbed the lightning of his blade,<br>     And gave the foe his forfeit life.<br>  <br>  Low on the heath, or on the deck,<br>     In bloody mail or wet with brine,<br>  Asleep he saw about her neck<br>     The wreath of gold and rubies shine;<br>  <br>  He saw her brows, her lovelit face,<br>     And on her cheek one passionate tear;<br>  He felt in dreams the rich embrace,<br>     The beating heart of Guinevere.<br>  <br>  "Visions that haunt my couch, my path,<br>     Although the waste, unfathomed sea<br>  Should rise against me white with wrath<br>     I must behold her verily,<br>  <br>  "Once ere I die," he said, and turned<br>     Westward his faded silken sails<br>  From isles where cloudy mountains burned,<br>     And north to Severn-watered Wales.<br>  <br>  Beside the Usk King Arthur kept<br>     His Easter court, a glittering rout.<br>  But Lancelot, because there swept<br>     A passion of despair throughout<br>  <br>  His being, when he saw once more<br>     The sky that canopied, the tide<br>  That girdled Guinevere, forebore<br>     His soul's desire, and wandered wide<br>  <br>  In unknown seas companionless,<br>     Eating his heart, until by chance<br>  He drifted into Lyonesse,<br>     The wave-worn kingdom of romance.<br>  <br>  He leapt ashore and watched his barque<br>     Unmastered stagger to its doom;<br>  Then doffed his arms and fled baresark<br>     Into the forest's beckoning gloom.<br>  <br>  The exceeding anguish of his mind<br>     Had broken him.  "King Arthur's trust,"<br>  He cried; "ignoble, fateful, blind!<br>     Her love and my love, noxious lust!<br>  <br>  "Dupes of our senses!  Let us eat<br>     In caverns fathoms underground,<br>  Alone, ashamed!  To sit at meat<br>     In jocund throngs?--the most profound<br>  <br>  "Device of life the mountebank,<br>     Vendor of gilded ashes!  Steal<br>  From every sight to use the rank<br>     And loathsome needs that men conceal;<br>  <br>  "And crush and drain in curtained beds<br>     The clusters called of love; but feed<br>  With garlanded uplifted heads;<br>     Invite the powers that sanction greed<br>  <br>  "To countenance the revel; boast<br>     Of hunger, thirst; be drunken; claim<br>  Indulgence to the uttermost,<br>     Replenishing the founts of shame!"<br>  <br>  He gathered berries, efts, and snails,<br>     Sorrel, and new-burst hawthorn leaves;<br>  Uprooted with his savage nails<br>     Earth-nuts; and under rocky eaves<br>  <br>  Shamefast devoured them, out of sight<br>     In darkness, lest the eye of beast,<br>  Or bird, or star, or thing of night<br>     Uncouth, unknown, should watch him feast.<br>  <br>  At noon in twilight depths of pine<br>     He heard the word Amaimon spoke;<br>  He saw the pallid, evil sign<br>     The wred-eld lit upon the oak.<br>  <br>  The viper loitered in his way;<br>     The minx looked up with bloodshot leer;<br>  Ill-meaning fauns and lamiae<br>     With icy laughter flitted near.<br>  <br>  But if he came upon a ring<br>     Of sinless elves, and crept unseen<br>  Beneath the brake to hear them sing,<br>     And watch them dancing on the green,<br>  <br>  They touched earth with their finger-tips;<br>     They ceased their roundelay; they laid<br>  A seal upon their elfin lips<br>     And vanished in the purple shade.<br>  <br>  At times he rent the dappled flank<br>     Of some fair creature of the chase,<br>  Mumbled its flesh, or growling drank<br>     From the still-beating heart, his face<br>  <br>  And jowl ruddled, and in his hair<br>     And beard, blood-painted straws and burs,<br>  While eagles barked screening the air,<br>     And wolves that were his pensioners.<br>  <br>  Sometimes at night his mournful cry<br>     Troubled all waking things; the mole<br>  Dived to his deepest gallery;<br>     The vixen from the moonlit knoll<br>  <br>  Passed like a shadow underground,<br>     And the mad satyr in his lair<br>  Whined bodeful at the world-old sound<br>     Of inarticulate despair.<br>  <br>  Sir Lancelot, beloved of men!<br>     The ancient earth gat hold of him;<br>  A year was blotted from his ken<br>     In the enchanted forest dim.<br>  <br>  At Easter when the thorn beset<br>     The bronzing wood with silver sprays,<br>  And hyacinth and violet<br>     Empurpled all the russet ways;<br>  <br>  When buttercup and daffodil<br>     A stainless treasure-trove unrolled,<br>  And cowslips had begun to fill<br>     Their chalices with sweeter gold,<br>  <br>  He heard a sound of summer rush<br>     By swarthy grove and kindled lawn;<br>  He heard, he sighed to hear the thrush<br>     Singing alone before the dawn.<br>  <br>  Forward he stalked with eyes on fire<br>     Like one who keeps in sound and sight<br>  An angel with celestial lyre<br>     Descanting rapturous delight.<br>  <br>  He left behind the spell-bound wood;<br>     He saw the branchless air unfurled;<br>  He climbed a hill and trembling stood<br>     Above the prospect of the world.<br>  <br>  With lustre in its bosom pent<br>     From many a shining summer day<br>  And harvest moon, the wan sea leant<br>     Against a heaven of iron-grey.<br>  <br>  Inland on the horizon beat<br>     And flickered, drooping heavily,<br>  A fervid haze, a vaporous heat,<br>     The dusky eyelid of the sky.<br>  <br>  White ways, white gables, russet thatch<br>     Fretted the green and purple plain;<br>  The herd undid his woven latch;<br>     The bleating flock went forth again;<br>  <br>  The skylarks uttered lauds and prime;<br>     The sheep-bells rang from hill to hill;<br>  The cuckoo pealed his mellow chime;<br>     The orient bore a burden shrill.<br>  <br>  His memory struggled half awake;<br>     Dimly he groped within to see<br>  What star, what sun, what light should break<br>     And set his darkened spirit free.<br>  <br>  But from without deliverance came:<br>     Afar he saw a horseman speed,<br>  A knight, a spirit clad in flame<br>     Riding upon a milkwhite steed.<br>  <br>  For now the sun had quenched outright<br>     The clouds and all their working charms,<br>  Marshalled his legionary light,<br>     And fired the rider's golden arms.<br>  <br>  Softly the silver billows flowed;<br>     Beneath the hill the emerald vale<br>  Dipped seaward; on the burnished road<br>     The milkwhite steed, the dazzling mail<br>  <br>  Advanced and flamed against the wind;<br>     And Lancelot, his body rent<br>  With the fierce trial of his mind<br>     To know, reeled down the steep descent.<br>  <br>  Remembrances of battle plied<br>     His soul with ruddy beams of day.<br>  "A horse! a lance! to arms!" he cried,<br>     And stood there weeping in the way.<br>  <br>  "Speak!" said the knight.  "What man are you?"<br>     "I know not yet.  Surely of old<br>  I rode in arms, and fought and slew<br>     In jousts and battles manifold."<br>  <br>  Oh, wistfully he drew anear,<br>     Fingered the reins, the jewelled sheath;<br>  With rigid hand he grasped the spear,<br>     And shuddering whispered, "Life and death,<br>  <br>  "Love, lofty deeds, renown--did these<br>     Attend me once in days unknown?"<br>  With courtesy, with comely ease,<br>     And brows that like his armour shone,<br>  <br>  The golden knight dismounting took<br>     Sir Lancelot by the hand and said,<br>  "Your voice of woe, your lonely look<br>     As of a dead man whom the dead<br>  <br>  "Themselves cast out--whence are they, friend?"<br>     Sir Lancelot a moment hung<br>  In doubt, then knelt and made an end<br>     Of all his madness, tensely strung<br>  <br>  In one last effort to be free<br>     Of evil things that wait for men<br>  In secret, strangle memory,<br>     And shut the soul up in their den.<br>  <br>  "Spirit," he said, "I know your eyes:<br>     They bridge with light the heavy drift<br>  Of years. . . .  A woman said, 'Arise;<br>     And if you love the Queen, be swift!'<br>  <br>  "The token was an emerald chased<br>     In gold, once mine.  Wherefore I rode<br>  At dead of night in proudest haste<br>     To Payarne where the Queen abode.<br>  <br>  "A crafty witch gave me to drink:<br>     Almost till undern of the morn<br>  Silent, in darkness. . . .  When I think<br>     It was not Guinevere, self-scorn<br>  <br>  "Cuts to the marrow of my bones,<br>     A blade of fire.  Can wisdom yield<br>  No mood, no counsel, that atones<br>     For wasted love! . . .  Heaven had revealed<br>  <br>  "That she should bear a child to me<br>     My bed-mate said. . . .  Yet am I mad?<br>  The offspring of that treachery!<br>     The maiden kngiht!  You--Galahad,<br>  <br>  "My son, who make my trespass dear!"<br>     His look released his father's thought--<br>  The darkling orbs of Guinevere;<br>     For so had Lancelot's passion wrought.<br>  <br>  With tenderer tears than women shed<br>     Sir Galahad held his father fast.<br>  "Now I shall be your squire," he said.<br>     But Lancelot fought him long.  At last<br>  <br>  The maiden gently overpowered<br>     The man.  Upon his milkwhite steed<br>  He brought him where a castle towered<br>     Midmost a green enamelled mead;<br>  <br>  And clothed his body, clothed his heart<br>     In human garniture once more.<br>  "My father, bid me now depart.<br>     I hear beside the clanging shore,<br>  <br>  "Above the storm, or in the wind,<br>     Outland, or on the old Roman street,<br>  A chord of music intertwined<br>     From wandering tones deep-hued and sweet.<br>  <br>  "Afar or near, at noon, at night,<br>     The braided sound attends and fills<br>  My soul with peace, as heaven with light<br>     O'erflows when morning crowns the hills.<br>  <br>  "And with the music, seen or hid,<br>     A blood-rose on the palace lawn,<br>  A fount of crimson, dark amid<br>     The stains and glories of the dawn;<br>  <br>  "Above the city's earthly hell<br>     A token ominous of doom,<br>  A cup on fire and terrible<br>     With thunders in its ruddy womb;<br>  <br>  "But o'er the hamlet's fragrant smoke,<br>     The dance and song at eventide,<br>  A beating heart, the gentle yoke<br>     Of life the bridegroom gives the bride;<br>  <br>  "A ruby shadow on the snow;<br>     A flower, a lamp--through every veil<br>  And mutable device I know,<br>     And follow still the Holy Grail<br>  <br>  "Until God gives me my new name<br>     Empyreal, and the quest be done."<br>  Then like a spirit clad in flame,<br>     He kissed his father and was gone.<br>  <br>  Long gazed Sir Lancelot on the ground<br>     Tormented till benign repose<br>  Enveloped him in depths profound<br>     Of sweet oblivion.  When he rose<br>  <br>  The bitterest was past.  "And I<br>     Shall follow now the Holy Grail,<br>  Seen, or unseen, until I die:<br>     My very purpose shall avail<br>  <br>  "My soul," he said.  By day, by night,<br>     He rode abroad, his vizor up;<br>  With sun and moon his vehement sight<br>     Fought for a vision of the cup--<br>  <br>  In vain.  For evermore on high<br>     When darkness set the spaces free,<br>  And brimming stars hung from the sky<br>     Low down, and spilt their jewellery,<br>  <br>  Behind the nightly squandered fire,<br>     Through a dim lattice only seen<br>  By love, a look of rapt desire<br>     Fell from a vision of the Queen.<br>  <br>  From heaven she bent when twilight knit<br>     The dusky air and earth in one;<br>  He saw her like a goddess sit<br>     Enthroned upon the noonday sun.<br>  <br>  Wherefore he girt himself again:<br>     In lawless towns and savage lands,<br>  He overthrew unrighteous men,<br>     Accomplishing the King's commands.<br>  <br>  In passages of gulfs and sounds<br>     When wild winds dug the sailor's grave,<br>  When clouds and billows merged their bounds,<br>     And the keel climbed the slippery wave,<br>  <br>  A sweet sigh laced the tempest; nay,<br>     Low at his ear he heard her speak;<br>  Among the hurtling sheaves of spray<br>     Her loosened tresses swept his cheek.<br>  <br>  And in the revelry of death,<br>     If human greed of slaughter cast<br>  Remorse aside, a violet breath,<br>     The incense of her being passed<br>  <br>  Across his soul, and deeply swayed<br>     The fount of pity; o'er the strife<br>  He curbed the lightning of his blade,<br>     And gave the foe his forfeit life.<br>  <br>  His love, in utter woe annealed,<br>     Escaped the furnace, sweet and clear--<br>  His love that on the world had sealed<br>     The look, the soul of Guinevere.<br>  <br>
