unwilling she<br>           To wed the king she ne'er had seen.<br>  And who, that knows how love may be<br>  Bound not by any man's decree,<br>  But works its wilful way and free<br>  To what dim fate it cannot see,<br>           Through peril and through woe,<br>  Shall wonder that between these twain,<br>     The goodliest of all splendid men,<br>     The loveliest woman living then,<br>  A spell, a charm their souls to chain,<br>  A bond of dread, delightful pain<br>           Silent and strong should grow?<br>  <br>  All day adown the shining seas<br>           They saw the sunlight gleam;<br>  The straining canvas caught the breeze<br>           That surged upon their beam,<br>  Till the long hours to evening drew,<br>           Hushed to a whisper sank the wind,<br>  And ribboned out across the blue<br>           The fleecy clouds far-streaming thinned<br>  Into illumined lines of mist<br>  By the red sunset redly kissed,<br>           And blushing rosy-bright,<br>  In that short hour of lesser life<br>  That drifts between the alternate strife<br>           Of restless day and night.<br>  <br>  Faint as a bank of cloud that sails<br>           Where sea-line touches sky,<br>  They saw the hilly coast of Wales<br>           On the horizon lie;<br>  And gazing at the distant heights,<br>           'How long?' she asked; 'how many more<br>  Of sunny days and starry nights<br>           Before we reach Tintagel's shore?'<br>  'By wind and tide so fairly sped,<br>  On the third day,' Sir Tristram said,<br>  'I doubt not we shall see you led<br>  In royal state, a bride to wed<br>           With Mark, my kinsman lord.'<br>  And either in the other's eyes<br>  A moment glanced, aware and wise<br>  Of speech that in deep silence lies,<br>  Of fear that through great stillness cries;<br>           Nor spake they other word.<br>  <br>  The sun slid down behind the west;<br>           Bright grew the milky moon;<br>  That dream of dusk, that hour of rest<br>           Was ended all too soon;<br>  Fresh sang the breeze at sunset lulled;<br>           The rattling tackle quivered tight;<br>  The sullen waters, lately dulled,<br>     Gleamed with a myriad points of white.<br>  Close-hauled, with sheets no longer slacked,<br>  Windward the golden galley tacked,<br>  And by the cloud-ribbed heavens tracked,<br>           Through the gray twilight, she<br>  Into the moonshine and the dark<br>  Went gliding like a phantom bark<br>           Adown a fairy sea.<br>  <br>  One gleaming planet pale and red<br>           They saw about them burn,<br>  The mirrored moonlight far ahead<br>           Lay glistening, and astern<br>  Like trampled snow her froth-strewn wake,<br>           Whereon were shadowed blurred and black<br>  The broad sails and the high-raised deck,<br>           Slow-fading followed on her track.<br>  The crested water slapped her bows<br>  Like spray on some strong swimmer's brows<br>           Who beats against the breeze;<br>  And where, the shattered foam amid,<br>  Her knife-edged battle-bleak was hid,<br>  Purred a low ripple as she slid<br>           Along the gliding seas.<br>  Screened by the bulwark's lofty shade<br>           And lit by swinging lights<br>  Iseult sate idle with her maid,<br>           And Tristram with his knights.<br>  After the long inactive day<br>           Bound by the vessel's narrow space,<br>  With tale and song they whiled away<br>           This last, late hour of twilight grace.<br>  O keen young faces eager-eyed,<br>  O strength and beauty well allied,<br>  Bright souls whose fire not yet had died,<br>  And hearts impassioned with the pride<br>           Which only youth can give!<br>  How well it were that night to be<br>  One there of Cornwall's chivalry, -<br>  Between the starlight and the sea<br>           How well to be alive!<br>  <br>  Sir Tristram took his harp of gold<br>           And sang an old, sad song,<br>  Of two whose love was never told<br>           Through lonely years and long.<br>  For she already was a wife<br>           Who suffered silent to the end,<br>  And he who loved her more than life,<br>           Her husband's own familiar friend.<br>  And Iseult feared the nameless pang<br>  Of yearning and despair that rang<br>  Through sense and spirit as he sang, -<br>           Almost it seemed to be<br>  Her own heart's music in the chords,<br>  Her soul's voice wailing in the words<br>           Of that wild melody.<br>  <br>  With lips light-parted, curving red<br>           Above a pearly gleam,<br>  With eyes in whose deep lustre played<br>           The shadow of a dream,<br>  Entranced she heard him, while the throng<br>           Of knights about her, great and tall,<br>  The brave, the battle-tried, the strong,<br>           Were held by the sweet minstrel all.<br>  And Tristram made the music thrill<br>  With witchery of sleep to still<br>  And lull the listeners at his will<br>  Where round him rested they, until<br>           He saw the wakeful fire<br>  In their eyes soften, as the spell<br>  Of numbering languour on them fell;<br>           But hers he could not tire.<br>  <br>  Their souls were drowsed with sleep; they grew<br>           Aweary; one by one<br>  And two by two away they drew<br>           And left them twain alone.<br>  His fingers faltered on the strings,<br>           Upon his lips the music died,<br>  And stirred with dim disquietings<br>           He rose and gat him to her side.<br>  'The night grows old,' he said, 'and lo,<br>  Now the still hours more silent grow;<br>  Thy maiden waits for thee below;<br>  Ah, then, Iseult, I pray thee go,<br>           While I a vigil keep;<br>  In me such fires unrestful roll<br>  As drive the calmness from my soul,<br>           And from mine eyes the sleep!'<br>  No stir save that the vessel made<br>           Seemed there in all the world;<br>  In utter calm, in silence dead,<br>           She lay with canvas furled;<br>  The sudden landward breeze had sighed<br>           Its life away an hour ago;<br>  And hushed as in a shrine replied<br>           Iseult, her clear voice thrilling low, -<br>  'From me, too, sleep is far away;<br>  Should I fare better if I lay<br>  Wide-eyed until the weary day?<br>  Ah, Tristram, the may I not stay<br>           And watch with thee awhile?'<br>  And though he feared her presence nigh,<br>  Yet could he not her will deny,<br>  So with light words of courtesy<br>  Tristram made answer, marvelling why<br>  Such rapture in her touch should lie,<br>           Such peril in her smile!<br>  <br>  The starry heavens circled slow;<br>           The dreamy hours of sleep<br>  On wings of slumber brooded low<br>           Above the drowsy deep;<br>  But never life more wakeful glowed<br>           Through their twain hearts that beat in tune,<br>  As side by side the deck they trod<br>           And watched the westward-waning moon<br>  In burnished splendour round and large<br>  Like some spent warrior's battle-targe,<br>  Drop down behind the distant marge<br>           Of shadowy sea and sky, -<br>  So calm the night, so clear the sight<br>  Of those keen eyes whose vision bright<br>  Saw the last ragged wisp of light,<br>  Like flames on some faint far-off height,<br>           Melt to a mist and die!<br>  <br>  'Now,' said Sir Tristram, 'night is come<br>           To its most breathless tide;<br>  In this great silence ghostly-dumb<br>           We must no more abide.'<br>  'Ah, stay thou yet awhile!' she said,<br>           'Is not this hour at least our own?<br>  My heart is touched with sudden dread;<br>           I fear the stillness all alone,<br>  I fear the solitary hours,<br>  The darkness that above me towers<br>           In my low cabin's gloom,<br>  And most the sounds that sigh and groan<br>  All night of waters, like the moan<br>           Of souls that sob in doom.<br>  <br>  'But here no restless murmur mars<br>           The deep, unworldly spell<br>  Of glassy sea and solemn stars, -<br>           These that I love most well.<br>  And haply this the last time is<br>           That earth so free a mood can give,<br>  When not in dreams and memories<br>           But still in burning life I live.<br>  Ah, Tristram, to the world is shown<br>  The gilded glory of a throne,<br>  Yet she is friendless and alone<br>           Who weds a gray-haired king.<br>  Would God 'twere mine to choose between<br>  Love and the splendours of a queen,<br>  Or that I had not destined been<br>           For such proud sorrowing.'<br>  <br>  And Tristram found no word to say,<br>           Nor might his will devise<br>  To tell what pity in him lay,<br>           And he with silent eyes<br>  Gazed on her through the twilight dim,<br>           Desired, adored all else above,<br>  Dearer than his own life to him<br>           And fair beyond the dreams of love.<br>  Almost in fancy wild and sweet<br>  He felt his arms about her meet,<br>  His heart upon her bosom beat<br>           In passionate embrace;<br>  And through the pulses of his frame,<br>  And through his soul in shuddering flame<br>  The wonder of her beauty came,<br>  Till might he not, for fear and shame,<br>           Look more upon her face.<br>  'This is a bitter thing,' she said,<br>           'That comes upon my life;<br>  Almost I would that I were dead<br>           Than be that gaunt king's wife.<br>  Ah!  Tristram, like a little child<br>           My little woes on thee I pour;<br>  Forgive me if my words are wild.<br>           Forget them!  Now I say no more!'<br>  Then with low voice he answered, 'Nay,<br>  Iseult, there is no word to say<br>  Save this, that if on any day<br>  All else desert thee or betray,<br>           Then look thou unto me;<br>  And if I fail thee may my name<br>  Be blotted from the book of fame,<br>  And in the silence set with them<br>  Which for dishonour and black shame<br>           May never spoken be!<br>  <br>  'And now, since all sweet hours must die,<br>           Since even the dark has sight<br>  And ears that gape and tongues that lie,<br>           My lady fair, good-night!'<br>  Then lifted she her wistful eyes<br>           To where in the faint light he stood<br>  Seeming of more than mortal size<br>           Near her, and splendid as a god.<br>  And all her strength grew weak and dim;<br>  She loved the clean-cut length of limb,<br>  The beauty and the might of him,<br>           The proud imperial face<br>  With features clear against the night,<br>  And eyes now lit with tender light<br>  Which in the battle, blue and bright<br>           So terribly might blaze.<br>  <br>  They passed from where the encircling screen<br>           Had hid them in its frame,<br>  Whose silken curtains hung between<br>           The middle ship and them;<br>  And beautiful before their sight<br>           All the great galley dreaming lay,<br>  The mightiest ship that e'er in fight<br>           Or peaceful errand flung the spray.<br>  Her tall masts tapered overhead;<br>  A hundred steps a man might tread<br>  From rudder-post to figure-head,<br>           A score across her beam;<br>  High-decked, and slender, lithe of bow<br>  Was she; and sheer the deep to plough<br>  The royal dragon on her prow<br>           Shone with a golden gleam.<br>  <br>  All living things, as in some realm<br>           Sleep-haunted, seemed to drowse;<br>  The steersman nodded at the helm,<br>           And in the distant bows<br>  The seaman of the watch looked out<br>           Over the deep and never stirred;<br>  Neither was any call nor shout<br>           Nor murmur of low voices heard;<br>  And laced by shadows gaunt and gray<br>  From the pale mast-light's ghostly ray,<br>  Beside their oars the rowers lay<br>           Like sleepers dumb in death.<br>  'Speak low; step softly!' Tristram said,<br>  'Iseult, we are as two that tread<br>  With mortal feet the darkness dread<br>  On some gray vessel of the dead<br>           Where none but we have breath!'<br>  <br>  The sheen of stars was all that came<br>           From the blue vault of night,<br>  Yet the wide waters were aflame<br>           With luminous, dim light.<br>  Most strange it was how silent gleamed<br>           Those pale fires on the deep around,<br>  And once, when a star shot, it seemed<br>           There should have been some gentle sound.<br>  No stir, no breath, above, beneath!<br>  All earth, all heaven were calm as death,<br>           Save only, now and then,<br>  A low wave lapped the vessel's side,<br>  And faint above their heads replied<br>  The tap of quivering rope and slide,<br>  As smooth she rocked upon the tide,<br>           And all was hushed again.<br>  <br>  'Now,' said Iseult, 'I must obey<br>           If thou wilt have it so;<br>  A maiden has no voice to say<br>           What things she will or no.<br>  Howe'er the impatient heart rebels<br>           Still must she suffer and be dumb:<br>  Therefore in this, as in all else,<br>           Perforce I yield.  Then, Tristram, come!'<br>  And down the narrow stairway slow,<br>  Lit by a flickering lantern's glow,<br>  They passed to the dim deck below,<br>           And at her door made pause.<br>  And Iseult opening looked therein:<br>  No light was there save what might win<br>  Through the high porthole drifting thin;<br>  Nor in the shadowy dusk within<br>           Or sound or movement was.<br>  <br>  'My maid is gone,' she said.  'Wilt thou<br>           Bring, of thy courtesy,<br>  The lamp that hangs behind thee now,<br>           And set it here for me?'<br>  So Tristram, in the old, free way<br>           Of those less rigid-mannered days,<br>  Entered with her, and silent they<br>           Pale in the lantern's dusky haze,<br>  With hands that trembled at the touch<br>  Each of the other, marvelled much<br>           What presence filled the room, -<br>  A lonely sound, it seemed to them,<br>  The breath of one who listened came,<br>  And watchful eyes of quiet flame<br>           Peered through the dim-lit gloom.<br>  <br>  Shamed with a strange and sacred awe,<br>           As in some holy place,<br>  He lifted up his eyes and saw,<br>           Framed round her loveliness,<br>  All things that in that chamber made<br>           Fit setting for a fairy face, -<br>  The walls with costly stuff arrayed,<br>           And mirrors of dark steely glaze;<br>  Fur of wild things with peril killed,<br>  And niche-held bowls with flowers filled,<br>  Whose faint erotic perfume thrilled<br>           Like some dim dream of old;<br>  And on a carven shelf that swung<br>  By chains of cunning silver slung,<br>  A great bejewelled flagon hung,<br>           And cup of curious gold.<br>  <br>  'Lo here,' she said, 'a gift I bring<br>           From that old home of mine,<br>  My father's gift to Mark the king,<br>           A meed of ancient wine.<br>  And now, I wis, the night grows cold; -<br>           Sir Tristram, ere thou go from here,<br>  Of this rare vintage century-old<br>           Drink thou one cup of royal cheer!"<br>  No seals upon the vessel were,<br>  And little toil it made for her<br>  To take the golden lid from there,<br>           And pour a cup thereof.<br>  Thus with her lithe, white hands she did,<br>  And thence her faltering fingers slid<br>  To where lay in her bosom hid<br>  A witchwork fiery and forbid,<br>           A reckless charm of love.<br>  <br>  By what compelling whim possessed<br>           Her soul might scarce divine,<br>  She drew the philtre from her breast<br>           And poured it in the wine,<br>  That secret draught her mother brewed<br>           For Mark and her, of magic might<br>  To sear the soul and sting the blood<br>           With passion perilously bright.<br>  They watched the rosy bubbles swim<br>  Around the golden beaker's brim,<br>  Like spirits loosened, which in dim<br>           Strange bondage were asleep;<br>  She drank, and kissed the goblet's edge.<br>  'Take thou,' she said, 'this cup I pledge!'<br>           And Tristram drained it deep.<br>  <br>  What breath of drowsy fire was this<br>           That made his soul to swoon;<br>  What drift of sunset memories,<br>           Or love beneath the moon;<br>  What surging music faintly sighed<br>           From ways in old glad seasons trod;<br>  What dreadful daring that defied<br>           The vengeance of eternal God?<br>  He looked into her eyes and felt<br>  His soul touch hers that in them dwelt,<br>  His brimming senses reel and melt<br>           In some supreme eclipse.<br>  He drew her to him; close and still<br>  She drooped as one who has no will;<br>  More near and near he leaned, until<br>  His whole heart's yearning seemed to thrill<br>           Like flame upon her lips!<br>  <br>  Ah joy beyond the world's desire!<br>           What burning dream was this?<br>  Their breathless souls drew in like fire<br>           All heaven in a kiss!<br>  Through deeps of space, it seemed to him,<br>           Her voice thrilled low: - 'Dear love,' she said,<br>  'My spirit faints; the world grows dim<br>           With joy that makes my soul afraid.'<br>  And from her arms' dear bondage he<br>  Loosed him, and said low-voiced, 'On me<br>  Fear also comes.  And now from thee<br>  Must I begone till day shall be.'<br>           Nor made they other speech,<br>  But parted there as dreamers might<br>  Whom some wild vision of the night<br>  Fulfils with anguish and delight,<br>           An-hungered each for each.<br>  <br>  And Tristram went, with shuddering soul,<br>           Back to the star-lit gloom.<br>  The brooding stillness seemed to roll<br>           On him great breaths of doom.<br>  Athrough the silence and the dark<br>           He heard a voice cry out his name,<br>  And saw the ghostly face of Mark<br>           Peer on him through a mist of flame; -<br>  'Art thou that knight whom rumour saith<br>  Men shall find faithful to the death?<br>  Is Tristram traitor to his faith?'<br>           And answer found he none,<br>  But felt about him darkly set,<br>  With some strange purpose dim and great,<br>  The glowing fetters of a fate<br>           He might not guide nor shun.<br>  <br>  In the gray watch before the morn<br>           Deep silence hung sublime;<br>  Darkly the dying night was borne<br>           To the great dark of Time.<br>  No breath the quiet water stirred<br>           Nor frayed the heaven's cloudy bars,<br>  Yet one who listened might have heard<br>           A sigh which to the drooping stars<br>  From the dead stillness of the deep<br>  Lifted, as from a world asleep<br>           That feels a dream withdrawn;<br>  And up the purple orient flowed<br>  A stormy light that throbbed and glowed<br>  Like the avenging fires of God, -<br>           The first faint pulse of dawn!<br>   <br>
