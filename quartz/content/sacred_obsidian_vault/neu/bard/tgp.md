 <p>This is the 'Gododdin'. Aneurin composed it.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">I</p>
 <p>Of manly disposition was the youth,<br>
 Valour had he in the tumult;<br>
 Fleet thick-maned chargers<br>
 Were under the thigh of the illustrious youth;<br>
 A shield, light and broad,<br>
 Was on the slender swift flank,<br>
 A sword, blue and bright,<br>
 Golden spurs, and ermine.<br>
 It is not by me<br>
 That hatred shall be shown to thee;<br>
 I will do better towards thee,<br>
 To celebrate thee in poetic eulogy.<br>
 Sooner hadst thou gone to the bloody bier<br>
 Than to the nuptial feast;<br>
 Sooner hadst thou gone to be food for ravens<br>
 Than to the conflict of spears;<br>
 Thou beloved friend of Owain!<br>
 Wrong it is that he should be under ravens.<br>
 It is evident in what region<br>
 The only son of Marro was killed.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">II</p>
 <p>Caeawg, the leader, wherever he came,<br>
 Breathless in the presence of a maid would he distribute the mead;<br>
 The front of his shield was pierced, when he heard<br>
 The shout of battle, he would give no quarter wherever he pursued;<br>
 He would not retreat from the combat, until he caused<br>
 Blood to stream; like rushes would he hew down the men who would<br>
 not yield.<br>
 The Gododdin does not relate, in the land of Mordai,<br>
 Before the tents of Madawg, when he returned,<br>
 Of but one man in a hundred that came back.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">III</p>
 <p>Caeawg, the combatant, the stay of his country,<br>
 Whose attack is like the rush of the eagle into the sea, when allured by<br>
 his prey;<br>
 He formed a compact, his signal was observed;<br>
 Better was his resolution performed: he retreated not<br>
 Before the host of Gododdin, at the close of day.<br>
 With confidence he pressed upon the conflict of Manawyd;<br>
 And regarded neither spear nor shield.<br>
 There is not to be found a habitation that abounded in dainties,<br>
 That has been kept from the attack of the warriors.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">IV</p>
 <p>Caeawg, the leader, the wolf of the strand,<br>
 Amber wreaths encircled his brow;<br>
 Precious was the amber, worth wine from the horn.<br>
 He repelled the violence of ignoble men, and blood trickled down;<br>
 For Gwynedd and the North would have come to his share,<br>
 By the advice of the son of Ysgyrran,<br>
 Who wore the broken shield.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">V</p>
 <p>Caeawg, the leader, armed was he in the noisy conflict;<br>
 His was the foremost part of the advanced division, in front of the hosts.<br>
 Before his blades fell five battalions.<br>
 Of the men of Deivyr and Brenneich, uttering groans:<br>
 Twenty hundred perished in one hour.<br>
 Sooner did his flesh go to the wolf, than he to the nuptial feast;<br>
 He sooner became food for the raven, than approached the altar;<br>
 Before he entered the conflict of spears, his blood streamed to the ground.<br>
 It was the price of mead in the hall, amidst the throng.<br>
 Hyveidd Hir shall be celebrated as long as there will be a minstrel.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">VI</p>
 <p>The men went to Gododdin with laughter and sprightliness,<br>
 Bitter were they in the battle, displaying their blades;<br>
 A short year they remained in peace.<br>
 The son of Bodgad, by the energy of his hand, caused a throbbing.<br>
 Though they went to churches to do penance,<br>
 The old, and the young, and the bold-handed,<br>
 The inevitable strife of death was to pierce them.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">VII</p>
 <p>The men went to Gododdin, laughing as they moved:<br>
 A gloomy disaster befell their army;<br>
 Thou slayest them with blades, without much noise:<br>
 Thou, powerful pillar of living right, causest stillness.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">VIII</p>
 <p>The men went to Catraeth, loquacious was their host;<br>
 Fresh mead was their feast, and also their poison.<br>
 Three hundred were contending with weapons;<br>
 And after sportive mirth, stillness ensued!<br>
 Though they went to churches to do penance,<br>
 The inevitable strife of death was to pierce them.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">IX</p>
 <p>The men went to Catraeth, fed with mead, and drunk.<br>
 Firm and vigorous; it were wrong if I neglected to praise them.<br>
 Around the red, mighty, and murky blades<br>
 Obstinately and fiercely fought the dogs of war.<br>
 If I had judged you to be on the side of the tribe of Brenneich,<br>
 Not the phantom of a man would I have left alive.<br>
 A friend I have lost, myself being unhurt;<br>
 He openly opposed the terrible chief -<br>
 The magnanimous hero did not seek the dowry of his father-in-law;<br>
 The son of Cian of Maen Gwyngwn.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">X</p>
 <p>The men went to Catraeth with the dawn;<br>
 They dealt peaceably with those who feared them.<br>
 A hundred thousand and three hundred engaged in mutual overthrow.<br>
 Drenched in gore they served as butts for lances;<br>
 Their post they most manfully defended<br>
 Before the retinue of Mynyddawg Mwynvawr.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">XI</p>
 <p>The men went to Catraeth with the dawn;<br>
 Regretted are their absence and their disposition;<br>
 Mead they drank, yellow, sweet, ensnaring.<br>
 In that year many a minstrel fell.<br>
 Redder were their swords than their plumes.<br>
 Their blades were white as lime, their helmets split into four parts,<br>
 Before the retinue of Mynyddawg Mwynvawr.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">XII</p>
 <p>The men went to Catraeth with the day:<br>
 Have not the best of battles their disgrace?<br>
 They made biers a matter of necessity.<br>
 With blades full of vigour in defence of Baptism.<br>
 This is best before the alliance of kindred.<br>
 Exceedingly great was the bloodshed and death, of which they were the cause,<br>
 Before the army of Gododdin, when the day occurred.<br>
 Is not a double quantity of discretion the best strengthener of a hero?</p>
 <p align="CENTER">XIII</p>
 <p>The man went to Catraeth with the day:<br>
 Truly he quaffed the foaming mead on serene nights;<br>
 He was unlucky, though proverbially fortunate:<br>
 His mission, through ambition, was that of a destroyer.<br>
 There hastened not to Catraeth<br>
 A chief so magnificent<br>
 As to his design on the standard.<br>
 Never was there such a host<br>
 From the fort of Eiddyn,<br>
 That would scatter abroad the mounted ravagers.<br>
 Tudvwlch Hir, near his land and towns,<br>
 Slaughtered the Saxons for seven days.<br>
 His valour remained until he was overpowered;<br>
 And his memory will remain among his fair associates.<br>
 When Tudvwlch, the supporter of the land, arrived,<br>
 The station of the son of Cilydd became a plain of blood.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">XIV</p>
 <p>The man went to Catraeth with the dawn;<br>
 To them were their shields a protection.<br>
 Blood they sought, the gleamers assembled:<br>
 Simultaneously, like thunder, arose the din of shields.<br>
 The man of envy, the deserter, and the base,<br>
 He would tear and pierce with pikes.<br>
 From an elevated position, he slew, with a blade,<br>
 In iron affliction, a steel-clad commander;<br>
 He subdued in Mordai those that owed him homage;<br>
 Before Erthgi armies groaned.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">XV</p>
 <p>Of the battle of Catraeth, when it shall be related,<br>
 The people will utter sighs; long has been their sorrow.<br>
 There will be a dominion without a sovereign, and a murky land.<br>
 The sons of Godebawg, an upright clan,<br>
 Bore, streaming, long biers.<br>
 Sad was the fate, just the necessity,<br>
 Decreed to Tudvwlch and Cyvwlch Hir.<br>
 Together they drank the clear mead<br>
 By the light of the rushes,<br>
 Though pleasant to the taste, its banefulness lasted long.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">XVI</p>
 <p>Before Echeching, the splendid Caer, he shouted:<br>
 Young and forward men followed him;<br>
 Before, on the Bludwe the horn was poured out<br>
 In the joyful Mordai;<br>
 Before, his drink would be bragget;<br>
 Before, gold and rich purple he would display;<br>
 Before, high-fed horses would bear him safe away;<br>
 Gwrthlev and he, when he poured out the liquor,<br>
 Before, he would raise the shout, and there would be a profitable diminution;<br>
 He was a bear in his march, always unwilling to skulk.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">XVII</p>
 <p>And now the early leader,<br>
 The sun is ascending,<br>
 The sovereign from which emanates universal light.<br>
 In the heaven of the Isle of Prydain.<br>
 Direful was the flight before the shaking<br>
 Of the shield in the direction of the victor;<br>
 Bright was the horn<br>
 In the hall of Eiddyn;<br>
 With pomp was he invited<br>
 To the feast of the intoxicating mead;<br>
 He drank the beverage of wine<br>
 At the meeting of the reapers;<br>
 He drank transparent wine,<br>
 With a daring purpose.<br>
 The reapers sing of war,<br>
 War with the shining wing;<br>
 The minstrels sang of war,<br>
 Of harnessed war,<br>
 Of winged war.<br>
 No shield was unexpanded<br>
 In the conflict of spears;<br>
 Of equal eye they fell<br>
 In the struggle of battle.<br>
 Unshaken in the tumult,<br>
 Without dishonour did he retaliate;<br>
 His will had to be conciliated<br>
 Ere became a green sward<br>
 The grave of Gwrvelling the great.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">XVIII</p>
 <p>Qualities they will honour.<br>
 Three forward (chiefs or bands) of Novant,<br>
 A battalion of five hundred;<br>
 Three chiefs and three hundred;<br>
 There are three Knights of battle.<br>
 From Eiddyn, arrayed in golden armour,<br>
 Three loricated hosts.<br>
 Three Kings wearing the golden torques;<br>
 Three bold Knights.<br>
 Three equal battles;<br>
 Three of the same order, mutually jealous.<br>
 Bitterly would they chase the foe;<br>
 Three dreadful in the conflict;<br>
 Lions, that would kill dead as lead.<br>
 There was in the war a collection of gold;<br>
 Three sovereigns of the people.<br>
 Came from the Brython,<br>
 Cynri and Cenon<br>
 And Cynrain from Aeron,<br>
 To greet with ashen lances.<br>
 The Deivyr distillers.<br>
 Came there from the Brython,<br>
 A better man than Cynon,<br>
 A serpent to his sullen foes?</p>
 <p align="CENTER">XIX</p>
 <p>I drank mead and wine in Mordai,<br>
 Great was the quantity of spears<br>
 In the assembly of the warriors.<br>
 He prepared food for the eagle.<br>
 When Cydywal sallied forth, he raised<br>
 The shout with the green dawn, and dealt out tribulation;<br>
 Splintered shields about the ground he left,<br>
 With darts of awful tearing did he hew down;<br>
 In the battle, the foremost in the van<br>
 The son of Syvno wounded; the astronomer knew it.<br>
 He who sold his life,<br>
 In the face of warning,<br>
 With sharpened blades committed slaughter;<br>
 But he himself was slain by crosses and spears.<br>
 According to the compact, he meditated an attack,<br>
 And admired a pile of carcases<br>
 Of gallant men of toil,<br>
 Whom in the upper part of Gwynedd he pierced.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">XX</p>
 <p>I drank wine and mead in Mordai,<br>
 And because I drank, I fell by the side of the rampart; the fate of allurement.<br>
 Colwedd the brave was not without ambition.<br>
 When all fell, thou didst also fall.<br>
 Thus, when the issue comes, it were well if thou hadst not sinned.<br>
 Present, it was related, was a person of a daring arm.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">XXI</p>
 <p>The men went to Catraeth; they were renowned;<br>
 Wine and mead from golden cups was their beverage;<br>
 That year was to them of exalted solemnity;<br>
 Three warriors and three score and three hundred, wearing the golden torques.<br>
 Of those who hurried forth after the excess of revelling,<br>
 But three escaped by the prowess of the gashing sword,<br>
 The two war-dogs of Aeron, and Cenon the dauntless,<br>
 And myself from the spilling of my blood, the reward of my sacred song.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">XXII</p>
 <p>My friend in real distress, we should have been by none disturbed,<br>
 Had not the white Commander led forth (his army):<br>
 We should not have been separated in the hall from the banquet of mead,<br>
 Had he not laid waste our convenient position.<br>
 He who is base in the field, is base on the hearth.<br>
 Truly the Gododdin relates that after the gashing assault,<br>
 There was none more ardent than Llivieu.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">XXIII</p>
 <p>Scattered, broken, of motionless form, is the weapon,<br>
 To which it was highly congenial to prostrate the horde of the Lloegrians.<br>
 Shields were strewn in the entrance, shields in the battle of lances;<br>
 He reduced men to ashes,<br>
 And made women widows,<br>
 Before his death.<br>
 Graid, the son of Hoewgi,<br>
 With spears,<br>
 He caused the effusion of blood.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">XXIV</p>
 <p>Adan was the hero of the two shields<br>
 Whose front was variegated, and motion like that of a war-steed.<br>
 There was tumult in the mount of slaughter, there was fire,<br>
 Impetuous were the lances, there was sunshine,<br>
 There was food for ravens, for the raven there was profit.<br>
 And before he would let them go free,<br>
 With the morning dew, like the eagle in his pleasant course,<br>
 He scattered them on either side as they advanced forward.<br>
 The Bards of the world will pronounce an opinion on men of valour.<br>
 No ransom would avail those whom his standard pursued.<br>
 The spears in the hands of the warriors were causing devastation.<br>
 And ere was interred under his horses,<br>
 One who had been energetic in his commands,<br>
 His blood had thoroughly washed his armour:<br>
 Buddvan, the son of Bleiddvan the Bold.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">XXV</p>
 <p>It were wrong to leave him without a memorial, a great wrong.<br>
 He would not leave an open gap through cowardice;<br>
 The benefit of the minstrels of Prydain never quitted his court.<br>
 On the calends of January, according to his design.<br>
 His land was not ploughed, since it lay waste.<br>
 He was a mighty dragon of indignant disposition,<br>
 A commander in the bloody field after the banquet of wine;--<br>
 Gwenabwy, the son of Gwen, of the strife of Catraeth.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">XXVI</p>
 <p>True it was, as songs relate,<br>
 No one's steed overtook Marchleu.<br>
 The lances of the commander<br>
 From his prancing horse, strewed a thick path.<br>
 As he was reared to bring slaughter and support.<br>
 Furious was the stroke of his protecting sword;<br>
 Ashen shafts were scattered from the grasp of his hand.<br>
 From the stony pile;<br>
 He delighted to spread destruction.<br>
 He would slaughter with a variegated sword from a furze-bush;<br>
 As when a company of reapers comes in the interval of fine weather,<br>
 Would Marchleu cause the blood to flow.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">XXVII</p>
 <p>Issac was sent from the southern region;<br>
 His conduct resembled the flowing sea;<br>
 He was full of modesty and gentleness,<br>
 When he delightfully drank the mead.<br>
 But along the rampart of Offer to the point of Maddeu,<br>
 He was not fierce without heroism, nor did he attempt scattering without effecting it,<br>
 His sword resounded in the mouths of mothers;<br>
 He was an ardent spirit, praise be to him, the son of Gwyddneu.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">XXVIII</p>
 <p>Ceredig, lovely is his fame;<br>
 He would gain distinction, and preserve it;<br>
 Gentle, lowly, calm, before the day arrived<br>
 In which he learned the achievements of the brave:<br>
 May it be the lot of the friend of songs to arrive<br>
 In the country of heaven, and recognize his home!</p>
 <p align="CENTER">XXIX</p>
 <p>Ceredig, amiable leader,<br>
 A wrestler in the impetuous fight;<br>
 His gold-bespangled shield was conspicuous on the battle-field,<br>
 His lances were broken, and shattered into splinters,<br>
 The stroke of his sword was fierce and penetrating;<br>
 Like a man would he maintain his post.<br>
 Before he received the affliction of earth, before the fatal blow.<br>
 He had fulfilled his in guarding his station.<br>
 May he find a complete reception<br>
 With the Trinity in perfect unity.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">XXX</p>
 <p>When Caradawg rushed to battle,<br>
 Like the woodland boar was the gash of the hewer;<br>
 He was the bull of battle in the conflicting fight;<br>
 He allured wild dogs with his hand.<br>
 My witnesses are Owain the son of Eulad,<br>
 And Gwryen, and Gwyn, and Gwryad.<br>
 From Catraeth, from the conflict,<br>
 From Bryn Hydwn, before it was taken,<br>
 After having clear mead in his hand,<br>
 Gwrien did not see his father.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">XXXI</p>
 <p>The men marched with speed, together they bounded onward;<br>
 Short-lived were they--having become drunk over the clarified mead.<br>
 The retinue of Mynyddawg, renowned in a trial,<br>
 Their life was the price of their banquet of mead; -<br>
 Caradawg and Madawg, Pyll and Ieuan,<br>
 Gwgawn and Gwiawn, Gwyn and Cynvan,<br>
 Peredur with steel arms, Gwawrddur and Aeddan.<br>
 A defence were they in the tumult, though with shattered shields,<br>
 When they were slain, they also slaughtered;<br>
 Not one to his native home returned.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">XXXII</p>
 <p>The men marched with speed, together were they regaled<br>
 That year over mead; great was their design:<br>
 How sad to mention them! how grievous the longing for them!<br>
 Their retreat was poison; no mother's son nurses them.<br>
 How long the vexation and how long the regret for them -<br>
 For the brave men of the wine-fed region!<br>
 Gwlyged of Gododdin, having partaken of the inciting<br>
 Banquet of Mynyddawg, performed illustrious deeds,<br>
 And dear was the price he gave for the purchase of the conflict of Catraeth.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">XXXIII</p>
 <p>The men went to Catraeth in battle-array and with shout of war,<br>
 With the strength of steeds, and with dark-brown harness, and with shields,<br>
 With uplifted javelins, and sharp lances,<br>
 With glittering mail, and with swords.<br>
 He excelled, he penetrated through the host,<br>
 Five battalions fell before his blade;<br>
 Ruvawn Hir,--he gave gold to the altar,<br>
 And gifts and precious stones to the minstrel.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">XXXIV</p>
 <p>No hall was ever made so loquacious,--<br>
 So great, so magnificent for the slaughter.<br>
 Morien procured and spread the fire,<br>
 He would not say that Cenon would not make a corpse<br>
 Of one harnessed, armed with a pike, and of wide-spread fame.<br>
 His sword resounded on the top of the rampart.<br>
 No more than a huge stone can be removed from its fixed place<br>
 Will Gwid, the son of Peithan, be moved.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">XXXV</p>
 <p>No hall was ever so full of delegates:<br>
 Had not Moryen been like Caradawg,<br>
 With difficulty could he have escaped towards Mynawg.<br>
 Fierce, he was fiercer than the son of Fferawg;<br>
 Stout was his hand, he set flames to the retreating horsemen.<br>
 Terrible in the city was the cry of the multitude;<br>
 The van of the army of Gododdin was scattered;<br>
 In the day of wrath he was nimble--and was he not destructive in retaliating?<br>
 The dependants of Mynyddawg deserved their horns of mead.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">XXXVI</p>
 <p>No hall was ever made so immovable<br>
 As that of Cynon of the gentle breast, sovereign of valuable treasures.<br>
 He sat no longer at the upper end of the high seat.<br>
 Those whom he pierced were not pierced again;<br>
 Sharp was the point of his lance;<br>
 With his enamelled armour he penetrated through the troops;<br>
 Swift in the van were the horses, in the van they tore along.<br>
 In the day of wrath, destruction attended his blade,<br>
 When Cynon rushed forward with the green dawn.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">XXXVII</p>
 <p>A grievous descent was made on his native place;<br>
 He repelled aggression, he fixed a boundary;<br>
 His spear forcibly pushed the laughing chiefs of war:<br>
 Even as far as Effyd reached his valour, which was like that of Elphin;<br>
 Eithinyn the renowned, an ardent spirit, the bull of conflict.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">XXXVIII</p>
 <p>A grievous descent was made on his native place,<br>
 The price of mead in the hall, and the feast of wine;<br>
 His blades were scattered about between two armies,<br>
 Illustrious was the knight in front of Gododdin.<br>
 Eithinyn the renowned, an ardent spirit, the bull of conflict.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">XXXIX</p>
 <p>A grievous descent was made in front of the extended riches;<br>
 The army dispersed with trailing shields.--<br>
 A shivered shield before the herd of the roaring Beli.<br>
 A dwarf from the bloody field hastened to the fence;<br>
 On our part there came a hoary-headed man to take counsel.<br>
 On a prancing steed, bearing a message from the golden-torqued leader.<br>
 Twrch proposed a compact in front of the destructive course:<br>
 Worthy was the shout of refusal;<br>
 We cried, 'Let heaven be our protection;<br>
 Let his compact be that he should be prostrated by the spear in battle.'<br>
 The warriors of the far-famed Aclud<br>
 Would not contend without prostrating his host to the ground.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">XL</p>
 <p>For the piercing of the skilful and most learned man,<br>
 For the fair corpse which fell prostrate on the ground,<br>
 For the failing of the hair from off his head,<br>
 From the grandson of the eagle of Gwydien,<br>
 Did not Gwyddwg defend with his spear,<br>
 Resembling and honouring his master?<br>
 Morieu of the sacred song defended<br>
 The wall, and deposed the head<br>
 Of the chief in the ground, both our support and our sovereign<br>
 Equal to three men, to please the maid, was Bradwen,<br>
 Equal to twelve was Gwenabwy the son of Gwen.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">XLI</p>
 <p>For the piercing of the skilful and most learned man,<br>
 He bore a shield in the action;<br>
 With energy did the stroke of his sword fall on the head.<br>
 In Lloegyr he caused gashings before three hundred chieftains.<br>
 He who takes hold of a wolf's mane without a club<br>
 In his hand, must naturally have a brave disposition under his cloak.<br>
 In the engagement of wrath and carnage<br>
 Bradwen perished--he did not escape.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">XLII</p>
 <p>A man moved rapidly on the wall of the Caer,<br>
 He was of a warlike disposition; neither a house nor a city was actively engaged in battle.<br>
 One weak man, with his shouts,<br>
 Endeavoured to keep off the birds of battle.<br>
 Surely Syll of Mirein relates that there were more<br>
 That had chanced to come from Llwy,<br>
 From around the inlet of the flood;<br>
 Surely he relates that there were more<br>
 At an early hour,<br>
 Equal to Cynhaval in merit.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">XLIII</p>
 <p>When thou, famous conqueror!<br>
 Wast protecting the ear of corn in the uplands<br>
 Deservedly were we said to run like men of mark.<br>
 The entrance to Din Drei was not guarded.<br>
 Such as was fond of treasure took it;<br>
 There was a city for the army that should venture to enter.<br>
 Gwynwyd was not called, where he was not.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">XLIV</p>
 <p>Since there are a hundred men in one house,<br>
 I know the cares of distress.<br>
 The chief of the men must pay the contribution.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">XLV</p>
 <p>I am not headstrong and petulant.<br>
 I will not avenge myself on him who drives me.<br>
 I will not laugh in derision.<br>
 Under foot for a while,<br>
 My knee is stretched,<br>
 My hands are bound,<br>
 In the earthen house,<br>
 With an iron chain<br>
 Around my two knees.<br>
 Yet of the mead from the horn,<br>
 And of the men of Catraeth,<br>
 I, Aneurin, will compose,<br>
 As Taliesin knows,<br>
 An elaborate song,<br>
 Or a strain to Gododdin,<br>
 Before the dawn of the brightest day.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">XLVI</p>
 <p>The chief exploit of the North did the hero accomplish;<br>
 Of a generous breast was he, liberal is his progeny;<br>
 There does not walk upon the earth, mother has not borne.<br>
 Such an illustrious, powerful, iron-clad warrior.<br>
 By the force of the gleaming sword he protected me,<br>
 From the dismal earthen prison he brought me out,<br>
 From the place of death, from a hostile region:--<br>
 Ceneu, the son of Llywarch, energetic, bold.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">XLVII</p>
 <p>He would not bear the reproach of a congress,<br>
 Senyllt, with his vessels full of mead;<br>
 He enriched his sword with deeds of violence;<br>
 He enriched those who rushed to war;<br>
 And with his arm made pools (of blood).<br>
 In front of the armies of Gododdin and Brennych.<br>
 Fleet horses were customary in his hall.<br>
 There was streaming gore, and dark-brown harness.<br>
 A long stream of light there was from his hand.<br>
 And like a hunter shooting with the bow<br>
 Was Gwen; and the attacking parties mutually repulsed each other,<br>
 Friend and foe by turns;<br>
 The men did not cut their way to flee,<br>
 But they were the general defenders of every region.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">XLVIII</p>
 <p>Llech Lleutu and Tud Lleudvre,<br>
 The course of Gododdin,<br>
 The course of Ragno, close at hand,<br>
 The hand that was director of the splendour of battle,<br>
 With the branch of Caerwys.<br>
 Before it was shattered<br>
 By the season of the storm, by the storm of the season,<br>
 To form a rank in front of myriads of men,<br>
 Coming from Dindywydd,<br>
 Excited with rage,<br>
 Deeply did they design,<br>
 Sharply did they pierce,<br>
 Wholly did the host chant,<br>
 Battered was their shield;<br>
 Before the bull of conflict<br>
 Their van was broken.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">XLIX</p>
 <p>His languid foes trembled greatly,<br>
 Since the battle of most active tumult,<br>
 At the border of Banceirw,<br>
 Around the border of Bancarw;<br>
 The fingers of Brych will break the bar,<br>
 For Pwyll, for Disteir, for Distar,<br>
 For Pwyll, for Roddig, for Rychwardd,<br>
 A strong bow was spent by Rys in Riwdrech.<br>
 They that were not bold did not attain their purpose;<br>
 None escaped that was once overtaken and pierced.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">L</p>
 <p>It was no good deed that his shield should be pierced.<br>
 On the side of his horse;<br>
 Not meetly did he place his thigh<br>
 On the long-legged, slender, gray charger.<br>
 Dark was his shaft, dark,<br>
 Darker was his saddle.<br>
 Thy man is in his cell,<br>
 Gnawing the shoulder of a buck;<br>
 May he have the benefit of his hand!<br>
 Far be he!</p>
 <p align="CENTER">LI</p>
 <p>It was well that Adonwy came to Gwen;<br>
 Gwen was left without Bradwen.<br>
 Thou didst fight, kill, and burn,<br>
 Thou didst not do worse than Moryen;<br>
 Thou didst not regard the rear or the van.<br>
 Of the towering figure without a helmet.<br>
 Thou didst not observe the great swelling sea of knights.<br>
 That would hew down, and grant no quarter to the Saxons.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">LII</p>
 <p>Gododdin, in respect of thee will I demand<br>
 The dales beyond the ridges of Drum Essyd.<br>
 The slave to the love of money is without self-control.<br>
 By the counsel of thy son let thy valour shine forth.<br>
 It was not a degrading advice.<br>
 In front of Tan Veithin,<br>
 From twilight to twilight, the edge gleamed.<br>
 Glittering exterior had the purple of the pilgrim.<br>
 Gwaws, the defenceless, the delight of the bulwark of battle, was slain.<br>
 His scream was inseparable from Aneurin.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">LIII</p>
 <p>Together arise the associated warriors,<br>
 To Catraeth the loquacious multitude eagerly march;<br>
 The effect of mead in the hall, and the beverage of wine.<br>
 Blades were scattered between the two armies.<br>
 Illustrious was the knight in front of Gododdin:--<br>
 Eithinyn the renowned, an ardent spirit, the bull of conflict.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">LIV</p>
 <p>Together arise the associated warriors,<br>
 Strangers to the country, their deeds shall be heard of.<br>
 The bright wave murmured along on its pilgrimage,<br>
 While the young deer were in full melody.<br>
 Among the spears of Brych thou couldst see no rods.<br>
 Merit does not accord with the rear.<br>
 Moryal in pursuit will not countenance evil deeds,<br>
 With his steel blade ready for the effusion of blood.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">LV</p>
 <p>Together arise the associated warriors.<br>
 Strangers to the country, their deeds shall be heard of.<br>
 There was slaughtering with axes and blades,<br>
 And there was raising large cairns over the men of toil.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">LVI</p>
 <p>Together arise the warriors, together met,<br>
 And all with one accord sallied forth;<br>
 Short were their lives, long is the grief of those who loved them.<br>
 Seven times their number of Lloegrians they had slain;<br>
 After the conflict women raised a lamentation;<br>
 Many a mother has the tear on her eyelash.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">LVII</p>
 <p>No hall was ever made so faultless<br>
 Nor a hero so generous, with the aspect of a lion of the greatest course,<br>
 As Cynon of the gentle breast, the most comely lord.<br>
 The city, its fame extends to the remotest parts;<br>
 It was the staying shelter of the army, the benefit of flowing melody.<br>
 In the world, engaged in arms, the battle-cry,<br>
 And war, the most heroic was he;<br>
 He slew the mounted ravagers with the sharpest blade;<br>
 Like rushes did they fall before his hand.<br>
 Son of Clydno, of lasting fame! I will sing<br>
 To thee a song of praise without limit, without end.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">LVIII</p>
 <p>From the banquet of wine and mead<br>
 They deplored the death<br>
 Of the mother of Hwrreith.<br>
 The energetic Eidiol.<br>
 Honoured her in front of the hill,<br>
 And before Buddugre,<br>
 The hovering ravens<br>
 Ascend in the sky.<br>
 The foremost spearmen fall<br>
 Like a virgin-swarm around him<br>
 Without the semblance of a retreat<br>
 Warriors in wonder shook their javelins,<br>
 With pallid lips,<br>
 Caused by the keenness of the destructive sword.<br>
 Wakeful was the carousal at the beginning of the banquet;<br>
 To-day sleepless is<br>
 The mother of Reiddun, the leader of the tumult.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">LIX</p>
 <p>From the banquet of wine and mead<br>
 They went to the strife<br>
 Of mail-clad warriors: I know no tale of slaughter which accords<br>
 So complete a destruction as has happened.<br>
 Before Catraeth, loquacious was the host.<br>
 Of the retinue of Mynyddawg, the unfortunate hero,<br>
 Out of three hundred but one man returned.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">LX</p>
 <p>From the banquet of wine and mead they hastened,<br>
 Men renowned in difficulty, careless of their lives;<br>
 In bright array around the viands they feasted together;<br>
 Wine and mead and meal they enjoyed.<br>
 From the retinue of Mynyddawg I am being ruined;<br>
 And I have lost a leader from among my true friends.<br>
 Of the body of three hundred men that hastened to<br>
 Catraeth, alas! none have returned but one alone.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">LXI</p>
 <p>Pressent, in the combat of spears, was impetuous as a ball,<br>
 And on his horse would he be, when not at home;<br>
 Yet illusive was his aid against Gododdin.<br>
 Of wine and mead he was lavish;<br>
 He perished on the course;<br>
 And under red-stained warriors<br>
 Are the steeds of the knight, who in the morning had been bold.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">LXII</p>
 <p>Angor, thou who scatterest the brave,<br>
 Like a serpent thou piercest the sullen ones,<br>
 Thou tramplest upon those that are clad in strong mail<br>
 In front of the army:<br>
 Like an enraged bear, guarding and assaulting,<br>
 Thou tramplest upon spears.<br>
 In the day of conflicts<br>
 In the swampy entrenchment:<br>
 Like Neddig Nar,<br>
 Who in his fury prepared<br>
 A feast for the birds,<br>
 In the tumultuous fight.<br>
 Upright thou art called from thy righteous deed,<br>
 Before the director and bulwark of the course of war,<br>
 Merin, and Madyen, it is fortunate that thou wert born.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">LXIII</p>
 <p>It is incumbent to sing of the complete acquisition<br>
 Of the warriors, who around Catraeth made a tumultuous rout.<br>
 With confusion and blood, treading and trampling.<br>
 The strength of the drinking horn was trodden down, because it had held mead;<br>
 And as to the carnage of the interposers<br>
 Cibno does not relate, after the commencement of the action.<br>
 Since thou hast received the communion thou shalt be interred.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">LXIV</p>
 <p>It is incumbent to sing of so much renown,<br>
 The loud noise of fire, and of thunder, and of tempest,<br>
 The noble manliness of the knight of conflict.<br>
 The ruddy reapers of war are thy desire,<br>
 Thou man of might! but the worthless wilt thou behead,<br>
 In battle the extent of the land shall hear of thee.<br>
 With thy shield upon thy shoulder thou dost incessantly cleave<br>
 With thy blade (until blood flows) like refined wine from glass vessels.<br>
 As money for drink, thou art entitled to gold.<br>
 Wine-nourished was Gwaednerth, the son of Llywri.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">LXV</p>
 <p>It is incumbent to sing of the illustrious retinue,<br>
 That, after the fatal impulse, filled Aeron.<br>
 Their hands satisfied the mouths of the brown eagles,<br>
 And prepared food for the beasts of prey.<br>
 Of those who went to Catraeth, wearing the golden torques,<br>
 Upon the message of Mynyddawg, sovereign of the people,<br>
 There came not without reproach on behalf of the Brython,<br>
 To Gododdin, a man from afar better than Cynon.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">LXVI</p>
 <p>It is incumbent to sing of so skilful a man;<br>
 joyous was he in the hall; his life was not without ambition;<br>
 Bold, all around the world would Eidol seek for melody;<br>
 For gold, and fine horses., and intoxicating mead.<br>
 Only one man of those who loved the world returned,--<br>
 Cynddilig of Aeron, the grandson of Enovant.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">LXVII</p>
 <p>It is incumbent to sing of the illustrious retinue<br>
 That went on the message of Mynyddawg, sovereign of the people,<br>
 And the daughter of Eudav Hir, the scourge of Gwananhon,<br>
 Who was appareled in purple robes, certain to cause manglings.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">LXVIII</p>
 <p>The warriors celebrated the praise of Nyved,<br>
 When in their presence fire was lighted.<br>
 On Tuesday, they put on their dark-brown garments;<br>
 On Wednesday, they polished their enamelled armour;<br>
 On Thursday, their destruction was certain;<br>
 On Friday, was brought carnage all around:<br>
 On Saturday, their joint I a hour did no execution;<br>
 On Sunday, their blades assumed a ruddy hue;<br>
 On Monday, was seen a pool knee-deep of blood.<br>
 Truly, the Gododdin relates that, after the toil,<br>
 Before the tents of Madawg, when he returned,<br>
 Only one man in a hundred came back.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">LXIX</p>
 <p>Early rising in the morn<br>
 There was a conflict at the Aber in front of the course,<br>
 The pass and the knoll were in conflagration.<br>
 Like a boar didst thou lead to the mount,<br>
 There was treasure for him that was fond of it; there was room;<br>
 And there was the blood of dark-brown hawks.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">LXX</p>
 <p>Early rising in an instant of time,<br>
 After kindling a fire at the Aber in front of the fence,<br>
 After leading his men in close array,<br>
 In front of a hundred he pierced the foremost.<br>
 It was sad that you should have caused a gushing of blood,<br>
 Like the drinking of mead in the midst of laughter.<br>
 It was brave of you to stay the little man<br>
 With the fierce and impetuous stroke of the sword.<br>
 How irresistible was he when he would kill<br>
 The foe! would that his equal could be found!</p>
 <p align="CENTER">LXXI</p>
 <p>He fell headlong down the precipice;<br>
 Song did not support his noble head:<br>
 It was a violation of privilege to kill him when bearing the branch,<br>
 It was the usage that Owain should ascend upon the course,<br>
 And extend, before the onset, the best branch,<br>
 And that he should pursue the study of meet and learned strains.<br>
 An excellent man was he, the assuager of tumult and battle,<br>
 His grasp dreaded a sword;<br>
 In his hand he bore an empty corselet.<br>
 O sovereign, dispense rewards<br>
 Out of his precious shrine.<br>
 Eidol, with frigid blood and pallid countenance,<br>
 Spreading carnage, his judgment was just and supreme,<br>
 Owner of horses<br>
 And strong trappings,<br>
 And ice-like shields;<br>
 Instantaneously he makes an onset, ascending and descending.]</p>
 <p align="CENTER">LXXII</p>
 <p>The leader of war with eagerness conducts the battle,<br>
 A mighty country loves mighty reapers.<br>
 Blood is a heavy return for new mead.<br>
 His cheeks are covered with armour all around,<br>
 There is a trampling of accoutrements - accoutrements are trampled.<br>
 He calls for death and brings desolation.<br>
 In the first onset his lances penetrate the targets,<br>
 And for light on the course, shrubs blaze on the spears.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">LXXIII</p>
 <p>A conflict on all sides destroyed thy cell;<br>
 And a hall there was to thee, where used to be poured out<br>
 Mead, sweet and ensnaring.<br>
 Gwrys make the battle clash with the dawn;<br>
 The fair gift of the tribes of the Lloegrians;<br>
 Punishment he inflicted until a reverse came.<br>
 May the dependants of Gwynedd hear of his renown.<br>
 Gwananhon will be his grave.<br>
 The lance of the conflict of Gwynedd,<br>
 The bull of the host, the oppressor of sovereigns,<br>
 Before earth pressed upon him, before he lay down;<br>
 Be the extreme boundary of Gododdin his grave!</p>
 <p align="CENTER">LXXIV</p>
 <p>An army is accustomed to be in hardships.<br>
 Mynawg, the bitter-handed leader of the forces,<br>
 He was wise, ardent, and stately:<br>
 At the social banquet he was not at all harsh.<br>
 They removed the valuable treasures that were in his possession:<br>
 And not the image of anything for the benefit of the region was left.<br>
 We are called! Like the sea is the tumult in the conflict;<br>
 Spears are mutually darting--spears all equally destructive;<br>
 Impelled are sharp weapons of iron, gashing even the ground,<br>
 And with a clang the sock falls on the pate.<br>
 A successful warrior was Fflamddur against the enemy.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">LXXV</p>
 <p>He supported war-horses and war-harness.<br>
 Drenched with gore on red-stained Catraeth<br>
 Is the shaft of the army of Dinus,<br>
 The angry dog of war upon the towering hill.<br>
 We are called to the honourable post of assault;<br>
 Most conspicuous is the iron-clad Heiddyn.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">LXXVI</p>
 <p>Mynawg of the impregnable strand of Gododdin,<br>
 Mynawg, for him our cheeks are sad:<br>
 Before the raging flame of Eiddyn he turned not aside.<br>
 He stationed men of firmness at the entrance,<br>
 He placed a thick covering in the van,<br>
 Vigorously he descended upon the furious foe;<br>
 He caused devastation and sustained great weight.<br>
 Of the retinue of Mynyddawg there escaped none<br>
 Except one frail weapon, tottering every way.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">LXXVII</p>
 <p>Since the loss of Moryed there was no shield-bearer,<br>
 To support the strand, or to set the ground on fire;<br>
 Firmly did he grasp in his hand a blue blade,<br>
 A shaft ponderous as a chief priest's crozier;<br>
 He rode a gray stately-headed courser,<br>
 And behind his blade there was a dreadful fall of slaughter;<br>
 When overpowered, he did not run away from the battle.<br>
 He poured out to us sparkling mead, sweet and ensnaring.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">LXXVIII</p>
 <p>I beheld the array from the high land of Adoyn;<br>
 They descended with the sacrifice for the conflagration;<br>
 I saw what was usual, a continual running to the town,<br>
 And the men of Nwythyon entirely lost;<br>
 I saw men in complete order approaching with a shout;<br>
 And the heads of Dyvynwal and Breych, ravens devoured them.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">LXXIX</p>
 <p>Blessed conqueror, of temper mild, the bone of the people,<br>
 With his blue streamer displayed, while the foes range the sea.<br>
 Brave is he on the waters, most numerous his host;<br>
 With a bold breast and loud shout they pierced him.<br>
 It was his custom to make a descent before nine armaments,<br>
 In the face of blood, of the country, and of the tribes.<br>
 I love the victor's throne which was for harmonious strains,<br>
 Cynddilig of Aeron, the lion's whelp!</p>
 <p align="CENTER">LXXX</p>
 <p>I could wish to have been the first to fall in Catraeth,<br>
 As the price of mead in the hall, and the beverage of wine;<br>
 I could wish to have been pierced by the blade,<br>
 Ere he was slain on the green plain of Uffin.<br>
 I loved the son of renown, who caused blood to flow,<br>
 And made his sword descend upon the violent.<br>
 Can a tale of valour before Gododdin be related,<br>
 In which the son of Ceidiaw has not his fame as a man of war?</p>
 <p align="CENTER">LXXXI</p>
 <p>It is sad for me, after our toil,<br>
 To suffer the pang of death through indiscretion;<br>
 And doubly grievous and sad for me to see<br>
 Our men falling from head to foot,<br>
 With a long sigh and with reproaches.<br>
 After the strenuous warriors of our native land and country,<br>
 Ruvawn and Gwgawn, Gwiawn and Gwlyged,<br>
 Men most gallant at their posts, valiant in difficulties,<br>
 May their souls, now after the conflict,<br>
 Be received into the country of heaven, the abode of tranquillity.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">LXXXII</p>
 <p>He repelled the chain through a pool of blood,<br>
 He slaughtered like a hero such as asked no quarter.<br>
 With a sling and a spear; he flung off his glass goblet<br>
 Of mead; in the presence of sovereigns he overthrew an army.<br>
 His counsel prevailed wherever he spoke.<br>
 A multitude that had no pity would not be allowed<br>
 Before the onset of his battle-axes and sword;<br>
 Sharpened they were; and his sounding blade was carefully watched.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">LXXXIII</p>
 <p>A supply of an army,<br>
 A supply of lances,<br>
 And a host in the vanguard,<br>
 With a menacing front:<br>
 In the day of strenuous exertion,<br>
 In the eager conflict,<br>
 They displayed their valour.<br>
 After intoxication,<br>
 And the drinking of mead,<br>
 There was no deliverance.<br>
 They watched us<br>
 For a while;<br>
 When it shall be related how the attack<br>
 Of horses and men was repelled, it will be pronounced the decree of fate.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">LXXXIV</p>
 <p>Why should so much anxiety come to me?<br>
 I am anxious about the maid--<br>
 The maid that is in Arddeg.<br>
 There is a precipitate running,<br>
 And lamentation along the course.<br>
 Affectionately have I deplored,<br>
 Deeply have I loved,<br>
 The illustrious dweller of the wood!<br>
 And the men of Argoed.<br>
 Woe to those who are accustomed<br>
 To be marshalled for battle!<br>
 He pressed hard upon the hostile force, for the benefit of chieftains,<br>
 Through rough woods,<br>
 And dammed-up waters,<br>
 To the festivities,<br>
 At which they caroused together: he conducted us to a bright fire,<br>
 And to a white and fresh hide.<br>
 Gereint from the south raised a shout;<br>
 A brilliant gleam reflected on the pierced shield.<br>
 Of the lord of the spear, a gentle lord;<br>
 Attached to the glory of the sea.<br>
 Posterity will accomplish<br>
 What Gereint would have done.<br>
 Generous and resolute wert thou!</p>
 <p align="CENTER">LXXXV</p>
 <p>Instantaneously his fame is wafted on high,<br>
 Irresistible was Angor in the conflict,<br>
 Unflinching eagle of the forward heroes;<br>
 He bore the toil, brilliant was his zeal;<br>
 He outstripped fleetest horses in war;<br>
 But he was mild when the wine from the goblet flowed.<br>
 Before the new mead, and his cheek became pale,<br>
 He was a man of the banquet over delicious mead from the bowl.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">LXXXVI</p>
 <p>With slaughter was every region filled;<br>
 His courage was like a fetter:<br>
 The front of his shield was pierced.<br>
 Disagreeable is the delay of the wrathful<br>
 To defend Rywoniawg.<br>
 The second time they raised the shout, and were crushed<br>
 By the war-horses with gory trappings.<br>
 An immovable army will his warlike nobles form,<br>
 And the field was reddened when he was greatly enraged.<br>
 Severe in the conflict, with a blade he slaughtered;<br>
 Sad news from the battle he brought;<br>
 And a New-year's song he composed.<br>
 Adan, the son of Ervai, there was pierced,<br>
 Adan! the haughty boar, was pierced,<br>
 One damsel, a maid, and a hero.<br>
 And when he was only a youth he had the rights of a king.<br>
 Being lord of Gwyndyd, of the blood of Glyd Gwaredawg.<br>
 Ere the turf was laid on the gentle face<br>
 Of the generous dead, now undisturbed,<br>
 He was celebrated for fame and generosity.<br>
 This is the grave of Garthwys Hir from the land of Rywoniawg.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">LXXXVII</p>
 <p>The coat of Dinogad was of various colours,<br>
 And made of the speckled skins of young wolves.<br>
 'Whistle! whistle!' the juggling sound!<br>
 I fain would dispraise it; it is dispraised by eight slaves.<br>
 When thy father went out to hunt,<br>
 With his pole on his shoulder, and his provisions in his hand,<br>
 He would call to his dogs of equal size, -<br>
 'Catch it! catch it! seize it! seize it!'<br>
 He would kill a fish in his coracle,<br>
 As a noble lion kills (his prey).<br>
 When thy father went up to the mountain<br>
 He would bring back the head of a roebuck, the head of a wild boar, the head of a stag,<br>
 The head of a spotted moor-hen from the mountain,<br>
 The head of a fish from the falls of Derwennyd.<br>
 As many as thy father could reach with his flesh-hook,<br>
 Of wild boars, lions, and foxes.<br>
 None would escape except those that were too nimble.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">LXXXVIII</p>
 <p>If distress were to happen to me through extortion,<br>
 There would not come, there would not be to me anything more calamitous.<br>
 No man has been nursed in a hall who could be braver<br>
 Than he, or steadier in battle.<br>
 And on the ford of Penclwyd his horses were the best;<br>
 Far-spread was his fame, compact his armour;<br>
 And before the long grass covered him beneath the sod,<br>
 He, the only son of Ffervarch, poured out the horns of mead.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">LXXXIX</p>
 <p>I saw the array from the headland of Adoyn,<br>
 Carrying the sacrifice to the conflagration;<br>
 I saw the two who from their station quickly fell;<br>
 By the commands of Nwython greatly were they afflicted.<br>
 I saw the men, who made a great breach, with the dawn at Adoyn;<br>
 And the head of Dyvynwal Vych, ravens devoured it.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">XC</p>
 <p>Gododdin, in respect of thee will I demand<br>
 In the presence of a hundred that are named with deeds of valour.<br>
 And of Gwarchan, the son of Dwywei of gallant bravery,<br>
 Let it be forcibly seized in one region.<br>
 Since the stabbing of the delight of the bulwark of battle,<br>
 Since earth has gone upon Aneurin,<br>
 My cry has not been separated from Gododdin.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">XCI</p>
 <p>Echo speaks of the formidable and dragon-like weapons,<br>
 And of the fair game which was played in front of the unclaimed course of Gododdin.<br>
 He brought a supply of wine into the tents of the natives,<br>
 In the season of the storm, when there were vessels on the sea,<br>
 When there was a host on the sea, a well-nourished host.<br>
 A splendid troop of warriors, successful against a myriad of men,<br>
 Is coming from Dindywydd n Dyvnwydd.<br>
 Before Doleu in battle, worn out were their shields, and battered their helmets.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">XCII</p>
 <p>With slaughter was every region filled.<br>
 His courage was like a fetter;<br>
 The front of his shield was pierced.<br>
 Disagreeable is the delay of the brave<br>
 To defend Rywyniawg.<br>
 The second time they reposed, and were crushed<br>
 By the war-horses with gory trappings.<br>
 An immovable army will his warlike and brave nobles form,<br>
 When they are greatly affronted.<br>
 Severe in the conflict with blades he slaughtered;<br>
 Sad news from the battle he brought;<br>
 And an hundred New-years' songs he composed.<br>
 Adan, the son of Urvai, was pierced;<br>
 Adan, the haughty boar, was pierced;<br>
 One damsel, a maid, and a hero.<br>
 And when he was only a youth he had the rights of a king,<br>
 Lord of Gwyndyd, of the blood of Cilydd Gwaredawg<br>
 Ere the turf was laid on the face of the generous dead,<br>
 Wisely collected were his treasure, praise, and high-sounding fame.<br>
 The grave of Gorthyn Hir from the highlands of Rywynawg.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">XCIII</p>
 <p>For the piercing of the skilful and most learned man,<br>
 For the fair corpse which fell prostrate on the ground,<br>
 Thrice six persons judged the atrocious deed early in the morning;<br>
 And Morien lifted up his ancient lance,<br>
 And, shouting, unbent his tight-drawn bow<br>
 Towards the Gwyr, and the Gwyddyl, and Prydein.<br>
 Towards the lovely, slender, bloodstained body<br>
 The sigh of Gwenabwy, the son of Gwen.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">XCIV</p>
 <p>For the afflicting of the skilful and most learned man,<br>
 There was grief and sorrow, when he fell prostrate on the ground;<br>
 His banner showed his rank, and was borne by a man at his side.<br>
 A tumultuous scene was beheld in Eiddyn, and on the battle-field.<br>
 The grasp of his hand prevailed<br>
 Over the Gynt, and the Gwyddyl, and Pryden,<br>
 He who meddles with the mane of a wolf without a club in his hand,<br>
 He must naturally have a brave disposition under his cloak.<br>
 The sigh of Gwenabwy, the son of Gwen.</p></body>
