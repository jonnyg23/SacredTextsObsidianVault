 <h1 align="CENTER">111. OF HILDIGNNA AND MORD VALGARD'S SON</h1>
 <p>Hildigunna woke up and found that Hauskuld was away out of his bed.</p>
 <p>"Hard have been my dreams," she said, "and not good; but go and search for him, Hauskuld."</p>
 <p>So they searched for him about the homestead and found him not.</p>
 <p>By that time she had dressed herself; then she goes and two men with her, to the fence, and there they find Hauskuld slain.</p>
 <p>Just then, too, came up Mord Valgard's son's shepherd, and told her that Njal's sons had gone down thence, "and," he said, "Skarphedinn called out to me and gave notice of the slaying as done by him."</p>
 <p>"It were a manly deed," she says, "if one man had been at it."</p>
 <p>She took the cloak and wiped off all the blood with it, and wrapped the gouts of gore up in it, and so folded it together and laid it up in her chest.</p>
 <p>Now she sent a man up to Gritwater to tell the tidings thither, but Mord was there before him, and had already told the tidings. There, too, was come Kettle of the Mark.</p>
 <p>Thorgerda said to Kettle, "Now is Hauskuld dead as we know, and now bear in mind what thou promisedst to do when thou tookest him for thy fosterchild."</p>
 <p>"It may well be," says Kettle, "that I promised very many things then, for I thought not that these days would ever befall us that have now come to pass; but yet I am come into a strait, for 'nose is next of kin to eyes,' since I have Njal's daughter to wife."</p>
 <p>"Art thou willing, then," says Thorgerda, "that Mord should give notice of the suit for the slaying?"</p>
 <p>"I know not that," says Kettle, "for me ill comes from him more often than good."</p>
 <p>But as soon as ever Mord began to speak to Kettle he fared the same as others, in that he thought as though Mord would be true to him, and so the end of their counsel was that Mord should give notice of the slaying, and get ready the suit in every way before the Thing.</p>
 <p>Then Mord fared down to Ossaby, and thither came nine neighbours who dwelt nearest the spot.</p>
 <p>Mord had ten men with him. He shows the neighbours Hauskuld's wounds, and takes witness to the hurts, and names a man as the dealer of every wound save one; that he made as though he knew not who had dealt it, but that wound he had dealt himself. But the slaying he gave notice of at Skarphedinn's hand, and the wounds at his brothers' and Kari's.</p>
 <p>After that he called on nine neighbours who dwelt nearest the spot to ride away from home to the Althing on the inquest.</p>
 <p>After that he rode home. He scarce ever met Njal's sons, and when he did meet them, he was cross, and that was part of their plan.</p>
 <p>The slaying of Hauskuld was heard over all the land, and was ill-spoken of. Njal's sons went to see Asgrim Ellidagrim's son, and asked him for aid.</p>
 <p>"Ye very well know that ye may look that I shall help you in all great suits, but still my heart is heavy about this suit, for there are many who have the blood feud, and this slaying is ill- spoken of over all the land."</p>
 <p>Now Njal's sons fare home.</p>
