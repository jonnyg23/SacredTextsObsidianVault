 <h1 align="CENTER">26. OF ASGRIM AND HIS CHILDREN</h1>
 <p>There was a man named Asgrim (1). He was Ellidagrim's son. The brother of Asgrim Ellidagrim's son was Sigfus (2). Gauk Trandil's son was Asgrim's foster-brother, who is said to have been the fairest man of his day, and best skilled in all things; but matters went ill with them, for Asgrim slew Gauk.</p>
 <p>Asgrim had two sons, and each of them was named Thorhall. They were both hopeful men. Grim was the name of another of Asgrim's sons, and Thorhalla was his daughter's name. She was the fairest of women, and well behaved.</p>
 <p>Njal came to talk with his son Helgi, and said, "I have thought of a match for thee, if thou wilt follow my advice."</p>
 <p>"That I will surely," says he, "for I know that thou both meanest me well, and canst do well for me; but whither hast thou turned thine eyes."</p>
 <p>"We will go and woo Asgrim Ellidagrim's son's daughter, for that is the best choice we can make."</p>
 <p>ENDNOTES:</p>
 <p>(1) Ellidagrim was Asgrim's son, Aundot the Crow's son. His mother's name was Jorunn, and she was the daughter of Teit, the son of Kettlebjorn the Old of Mossfell. The mother of Teit was Helga, daughter of Thord Skeggi's son, Hrapp's son, Bjorn's son the Roughfooted, Grim's son, the Lord of Sogn in Norway. The mother of Jorunn was Olof Harvest-heal, daughter of Bodvar, Viking-Kari's son.</p>
 <p>(2) His daughter was Thorgerda, mother of Sigfus, the father of Saemund the Learned.</p>
