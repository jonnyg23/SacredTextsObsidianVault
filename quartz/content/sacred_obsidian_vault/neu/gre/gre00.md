 <p>A life scarce worth the living, a poor fame<br>
 Scarce worth the winning, in a wretched land,<br>
 Where fear and pain go upon either hand,<br>
 As toward the end men fare without an aim<br>
 Unto the dull grey dark from whence they came:<br>
 Let them alone, the unshadowed sheer rocks stand<br>
 Over the twilight graves of that poor band,<br>
 Who count so little in the great world's game!</p>
 <p>Nay, with the dead I deal not; this man lives,<br>
 And that which carried him through good and ill,<br>
 Stem against fate while his voice echoed still<br>
 From rock to rock, now he lies silent, strives<br>
 With wasting time, and through its long lapse gives<br>
 Another friend to me, life's void to fill.</p>
