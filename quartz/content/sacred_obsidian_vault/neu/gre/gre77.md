 <i></i><p align="CENTER">Of the Sports at Heron-ness Thing.</p>
 <p>NOW the days wore till such time as men went to the Heron-ness Thing in spring-tide, and many came thronging there from that part of the country, wherefrom men had to go to that Thing for their suits. Men sat there long time both over the suits and over sports, for there were many blithe men in that country-side. But when Grettir heard that all men fared to the Thing, he made a plot with his friends; for he was in goodwill with those who dwelt nighest to him, and for them he spared nought that he</p>
 <p><a name="page_211"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 211</font></a></p>
 <p>could get. But now he said that he would go aland, and gather victuals, but that Illugi and Noise should stay behind. Illugi thought this ill counselled, but let things go as Grettir would.</p>
 <p>So Grettir bade them watch the ladders well, for that all things lay thereon; and thereafter he went to the mainland, and got what he deemed needful: he hid himself from men whereso he came, nor did any one know that he was on the land. Withal he heard concerning the Thing, that there was much sport there, and was fain to go thither; so he did on old gear and evil, and thus came to the Thing, whenas men went from the courts home to their booths. Then fell certain young men to talking how that the day was fair and good, and that it were well, belike, for the young men to betake them to wrestling and merrymaking. Folk said it was well counselled; and so men went and sat them down out from the booths.</p>
 <p>Now the sons of Thord, Hialti and Thorbiorn Angle, were the chief men in this sport; Thorbiorn Angle was boisterous beyond measure, and drove men hard and fast to the place of the sports, and every man must needs go whereas his will was; and he would take this man and that by the hands and drag him forth unto the playing-ground.</p>
 <p>Now first those wrestled who were weakest, and then each man in his turn, and therewith the game and glee waxed great; but when most men had wrestled but those who were the strongest, the bonders fell to talking as to who would be like to lay hand to either of the Thords, who have been aforenamed; but there was no man ready for that. Then the Thords went up to sundry men, and put themselves forward for wrestling, but <i>the nigher the call the further the man</i>. Then Thorbiorn Angle looks about, and sees where a man sits, great of growth, and his face hidden</p>

 <p>somewhat. Thorbiorn laid hold of him, and tugged hard at him, but he sat quiet and moved no whit. Then said Thorbiorn,</p>
 <p>"No one has kept his place before me to-day like thou hast; what man art thou?"</p>
 <p>He answers, "Guest am I hight."</p>
 <p>Said Thorbiorn, "Belike thou wilt do somewhat for our merriment; a wished-for guest wilt thou be."</p>
 <p>He answered, "About and about, methinks, will things change speedily; nor shall I cast myself into play with you here, where all is unknown to me."</p>
 <p>Then many men said he were worthy of good at their hands, if he, an unknown man, gave sport to the people. Then he asked what they would of him; so they prayed him to wrestle with some one.</p>
 <p>He said he had left wrestling, "though time agone it was somewhat of a sport to me."</p>
 <p>So, when he did not deny them utterly, they prayed him thereto yet the more.</p>
 <p>He said, "Well, if ye are so fain that I be dragged about here, ye must do so much therefor, as to handsel me peace, here at the Thing, and until such time as I come back to my home."</p>
 <p>Then they all sprang up and said that so they would do indeed; but Haft was the name of him who urged most that peace should be given to the man. This Hafr was the son of Thorarin, the son of Haft, the son of Thord Knob, who had settled land up from the Weir in the Fleets to Tongue-river, and who dwelt at Knobstead; and a wordy man was Hafr.</p>
 <p>So now he gave forth the handselling grandly with open mouth, and this is the beginning thereof.</p>
