 <i></i><p align="CENTER">Thorbiorn Angle goes to Drangey to speak with Grettir.</p>
 <p>WHENAS summer was far spent, Thorbiorn Angle went with a well-manned barge out to Drangey, and Grettir and his fellows stood forth on the cliff's edge; so there they talked together. Thorbiorn prayed Grettir to do so much for his word, as to depart from the island; Grettir said there was no hope of such an end.</p>
 <p>Then said Thorbiorn, "Belike I may give thee meet aid if thou dost this, for now have many bonders given up to me their shares in the island."</p>
 <p>Grettir answered, "Now hast thou shown forth that which brings me to settle in my mind that I will never go hence, whereas thou sayest that thou now hast the more part of the island; and good is it that we twain alone share the kale; for in sooth, hard I found it to have all the men of Skagafirth against me; but now let neither spare the other, for not such are we twain, as are like to be smothered in the friendship of men; and thou mayst leave coming hither, for on my side is all over and done."</p>
 <p>"<i>All things bide their day</i>," said Thorbiorn, "and an ill day thou bidest."</p>
 <p>"I am content to risk it," said Grettir; and in such wise they parted, and Thorbiorn went home.</p>
