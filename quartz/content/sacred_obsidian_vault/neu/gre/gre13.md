 <h1 align="CENTER">CHAP. VIII.</h1>
 <p>NOW Onund and Asmund sailed into the sea when they were ready, and held company together; then sang Onund this stave--</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Meet was I in days agone<br>
 For storm, wherein the Sweeping One,<br>
 Midst rain of swords, and the darts' breath,<br>
 Blew o'er all a gale of death.<br>
 Now a maimed, one-footed man<br>
 On rollers' steed through waters wan<br>
 Out to Iceland must I go;<br>
 Ah, the skald is sinking low."</p></dir>

 <p>They had a hard voyage of it and much of baffling gales from the south, and drove north into the main; but they made Iceland, and were by then come to the north off Longness when they found where they were: so little space there was betwixt them that they spake together; and Asmund said that they had best sail to Islefirth, and thereto they both agreed; then they beat up toward the land, and a south-east wind sprang up; but when Onund and his folk laid the ship close to the wind, the yard was sprung; then they took in sail, and therewith were driven off to sea; but Asmund got under the lee of Brakeisle, and there lay till a fair wind brought him into Islefirth; Helgi the Lean gave him all Kræklings'-lithe, and he dwelt at South Glass-river; Asgrim his brother came out some winters later and abode at North Glass-river; he was the father of Ellida-Grim, the father of Asgrim Ellida-Grimson.</p>
