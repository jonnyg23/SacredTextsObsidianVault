 <h1 align="CENTER">PART OF THE LAY OF SIGRDRIFA [1]</h1><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Now this is my first counsel,<br>
 That thou with thy kin<br>
 Be guiltless, guileless ever,<br>
 Nor hasty of wrath,<br>
 Despite of wrong done--<br>
 Unto the dead good that doeth.<br>
 Lo the second counsel,<br>
 That oath thou swearest never,<br>
 But trusty oath and true:<br>
 Grim tormenting<br>
 Gripes troth-breakers;<br>
 Cursed wretch is the wolf of vows.<br>
 This is my third rede,<br>
 That thou at the Thing<br>
 Deal not with the fools of folk;<br>
 For unwise man<br>
 From mouth lets fall<br>
 Worser word than well he wotteth.<br>
 Yet hard it is<br>
 That holding of peace<br>
 When men shall deem thee dastard,<br>
 Or deem the lie said soothly;<br>
 But woeful is home-witness,<br>
 Unless right good thou gettest it.<br>
 Ah, on another day<br>
 Drive the life from out him,<br>
 And pay the liar back for his lying.<br>
 Now behold the fourth rede:<br>
 If ill witch thee bideth,<br>
 Woe-begatting by the way,<br>
 Good going further<br>
 Rather than guesting,<br>
 Though thick night be on thee.<br>
 Far-seeing eyes<br>
 Need all sons of men<br>
 Who wend in wrath to war;<br>
 For baleful women<br>
 Bide oft by the highway,<br>
 Swords and hearts to soften.<br>
 And now the fifth rede:<br>
 As fair as thou seest<br>
 Brides on the bench abiding,<br>
 Let not love's silver<br>
 Rule over thy sleeping;<br>
 Draw no woman to kind kissing!<br>
 For the sixth thing, I rede<br>
 When men sit a-drinking<br>
 Amid ale-words and ill-words,<br>
 Dead thou naught<br>
 With the drunken fight-staves<br>
 For wine stealeth wit from many.<br>
 Brawling and drink<br>
 Have brought unto men<br>
 Sorrow sore oft enow;<br>
 Yea, bane unto some,<br>
 And to some weary bale;<br>
 Many are the griefs of mankind.<br>
 For the seventh, I rede thee,<br>
 If strife thou raisest<br>
 With a man right high of heart,<br>
 Better fight a-field<br>
 Than burn in the fire<br>
 Within thine hall fair to behold.<br>
 The eighth rede that I give thee:<br>
 Unto all ill look thou,<br>
 And hold thine heart from all beguiling;<br>
 Draw to thee no maiden,<br>
 No man's wife bewray thou,<br>
 Urge them not unto unmeet pleasure.<br>
 This is the ninth counsel:<br>
 That thou have heed of dead folk Whereso thou findest them a-field;<br>
 Be they sick-dead,<br>
 Be they sea-dead,<br>
 Or come to ending by war-weapons.<br>
 Let bath be made<br>
 For such men fordone,<br>
 Wash thou hands and feet thereof,<br>
 Comb their hair and dry them<br>
 Ere the coffin has them;<br>
 Then bid them sleep full sweetly.<br>
 This for the tenth counsel:<br>
 That thou give trust never<br>
 Unto oaths of foeman's kin,<br>
 Be'st thou bane of his brother,<br>
 Or hast thou felled his father;<br>
 Wolf in young son waxes,<br>
 Though he with gold be gladdened.<br>
 For wrong and hatred<br>
 Shall rest them never,<br>
 Nay, nor sore sorrow.<br>
 Both wit and weapons<br>
 Well must the king have<br>
 Who is fain to be the foremost.<br>
 The last rede and eleventh:<br>
 Until all ill look thou.<br>
 And watch thy friends' ways ever<br>
 Scarce durst I look<br>
 For long life for thee, king:<br>
 Strong trouble ariseth now already.</p></dir>
