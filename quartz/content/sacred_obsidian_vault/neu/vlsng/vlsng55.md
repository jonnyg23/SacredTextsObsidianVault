 <h1 align="CENTER">THE LAMENT OF ODDRUN.</h1>
 <p>There was a king hight Heidrik, and his daughter was called Borgny, and the name of her lover was Vilmund. Now she might nowise be made lighter of a child she travailed with, before Oddrun, Atil's sister, came to her,--she who had been the love of Gunnar, Giuki's son. But of their speech together has this been sung:</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>I have hear tell<br>
 In ancient tales<br>
 How a may there came<br>
 To Morna-land,<br>
 Because no man<br>
 On mould abiding<br>
 For Heidrik's daughter<br>
 Might win healing.<br>
 All that heard Oddrun,<br>
 Atil's sister,<br>
 How that the damsel<br>
 Had heavy sickness,<br>
 So she led from stall<br>
 Her bridled steed,<br>
 And on the swart one<br>
 Laid the saddle.<br>
 She made her horse wend<br>
 O'er smooth ways of earth,<br>
 Until to a high-built<br>
 Hall she came;<br>
 Then the saddle she had<br>
 From the hungry horse,<br>
 And her ways wended<br>
 In along the wide hall,<br>
 And this word first<br>
 Spake forth therewith:<br>
 "What is most famed,<br>
 Afield in Hunland,<br>
 Or what may be<br>
 Blithest in Hunland?"</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>QUOTH THE HANDMAID:</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"Here lieth Borgny,<br>
 Borne down by trouble,<br>
 Thy sweet friend, O Oddrun,<br>
 See to her helping!"</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>ODDRUN SAID:</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"Who of the lords<br>
 Hath laid this grief on her,<br>
 Why is the anguish<br>
 Of Borgny so weary?"</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>THE HANDMAID SAID:</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"He is hight Vilmund,<br>
 Friend of hawk-bearers,<br>
 He wrapped the damsel<br>
 In the warm bed-gear<br>
 Five winters long<br>
 Without her father's wotting."<br>
 No more than this<br>
 They spake methinks;<br>
 Kind sat she down<br>
 By the damsel's knee;<br>
 Mightily sand Oddrun,<br>
 Sharp piercing songs<br>
 By Borgny's side:<br>
 Till a maid and a boy<br>
 Might tread on the world's ways,<br>
 Blithe babes and sweet<br>
 Of Hogni's bane:<br>
 Then the damsel forewearied<br>
 The word took up,<br>
 The first word of all<br>
 That had won from her:<br>
 "So may help thee<br>
 All helpful things,<br>
 Fey and Freyia,<br>
 And all the fair Gods,<br>
 As thou hast thrust<br>
 This torment from me!"</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>ODDRUN SAID:</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"Yet no heart had I<br>
 For thy helping,<br>
 Since never wert thou<br>
 Worthy of helping,<br>
 But my word I held to,<br>
 That of old was spoken<br>
 When the high lords<br>
 Dealt out the heritage,<br>
 That every soul<br>
 I would ever help."</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>BORGNY SAID:</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"Right mad art thou, Oddrun,<br>
 And reft of thy wits,<br>
 Whereas thou speakest<br>
 Hard words to me<br>
 Thy fellow ever<br>
 Upon the earth<br>
 As of brothers twain,<br>
 We had been born."</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>ODDRUN SAID:</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"Well I mind me yet,<br>
 What thou saidst that evening,<br>
 Whenas I bore forth<br>
 Fair drink for Gunnar;<br>
 Such a thing, saidst thou,<br>
 Should fall out never,<br>
 For any may<br>
 Save for me alone."<br>
 Mind had the damsel<br>
 Of the weary day<br>
 Whenas the high lords<br>
 Dealt out the heritage,<br>
 And she sat her down,<br>
 The sorrowful woman,<br>
 To tell of the bale,<br>
 And the heavy trouble.<br>
 "Nourished was I<br>
 In the hall of kings--<br>
 Most folk were glad--<br>
 'Mid the council of great ones:<br>
 In fair life lived I,<br>
 And the wealth of my father<br>
 For five winters only,<br>
 While yet he had life.<br>
 "Such were the last words<br>
 That ever he spake,<br>
 The king forewearied,<br>
 Ere his ways he went;<br>
 For be bade folk give me<br>
 The gold red-gleaming,<br>
 And give me in Southlands<br>
 To the son of Grimhild.<br>
 "But Brynhild he bade<br>
 To the helm to betake her,<br>
 And said that Death-chooser<br>
 She should become;<br>
 And that no better<br>
 Might ever be born<br>
 Into the world,<br>
 If fate would not spoil it.<br>
 "Brynhild in bower<br>
 Sewed at her broidery,<br>
 Folk she had<br>
 And fair lands about her;<br>
 Earth lay a-sleeping,<br>
 Slept the heavens aloft<br>
 When Fafnir's-bane<br>
 The burg first saw.<br>
 "Then was war waged<br>
 With the Welsh-wrought sword<br>
 And the burg all broken<br>
 That Brynhild owned;<br>
 Nor wore long space,<br>
 E'en as well might be,<br>
 Ere all those wiles<br>
 Full well she knew.<br>
 "Hard and dreadful<br>
 Was the vengeance she drew down,<br>
 So that all we<br>
 Have woe enow.<br>
 Through all lands of the world<br>
 Shall that story fare forth<br>
 How she did her to death<br>
 For the death of Sigurd.<br>
 "But therewithal Gunnar<br>
 The gold-scatterer<br>
 Did I fall to loving<br>
 And should have loved him.<br>
 Rings of red gold<br>
 Would they give to Atli,<br>
 Would give to my brother<br>
 Things goodly and great.<br>
 "Yea, fifteen steads<br>
 Would they give for me,<br>
 And the load of Grani<br>
 To have as a gift;<br>
 But then spake Atli,<br>
 That such was his will,<br>
 Never gift to take<br>
 From the sons of Giuki.<br>
 "But we in nowise<br>
 Might love withstand,<br>
 And mine head must I lay<br>
 On my love, the ring-breaker;<br>
 And many there were<br>
 Among my kin,<br>
 Who said that they<br>
 Had seen us together.<br>
 "Then Atli said<br>
 That I surely never<br>
 Would fall to crime<br>
 Or shameful folly:<br>
 But now let no one<br>
 For any other,<br>
 That shame deny<br>
 Where love has dealing.<br>
 "For Atli sent<br>
 His serving-folk<br>
 Wide through the murkwood<br>
 Proof to win of me,<br>
 And thither they came<br>
 Where they ne'er should have come,<br>
 Where one bed we twain<br>
 Had dight betwixt us.<br>
 "To those men had we given<br>
 Rings of red gold,<br>
 Naught to tell<br>
 Thereof to Atli,<br>
 But straight they hastened<br>
 Home to the house,<br>
 And all the tale<br>
 To Atli told.<br>
 'Whereas from Gudrun<br>
 Well they hid it,<br>
 Though better by half<br>
 Had she have known it.</p>
 <p>"Din was there to hear<br>
 Of the hoofs gold-shod,<br>
 When into the garth<br>
 Rode the sons of Giuki.<br>
 "There from Hogni<br>
 The heart they cut,<br>
 But into the worm-close<br>
 Cast the other.<br>
 There the king, the wise-hearted,<br>
 Swept his harp-strings,<br>
 For the might king<br>
 Had ever mind<br>
 That I to his helping<br>
 Soon should come.<br>
 "But now was I gone<br>
 Yet once again<br>
 Unto Geirmund,<br>
 Good feast to make;<br>
 Yet had I hearing,<br>
 E'en out from Hlesey,<br>
 How of sore trouble<br>
 The harp-strings sang.<br>
 "So I bade the bondmaids<br>
 Be ready swiftly,<br>
 For I listed to save<br>
 The life of the king,<br>
 And we let our ship<br>
 Swim over the sound,<br>
 Till Atli's dwelling<br>
 We saw all clearly.<br>
 Then came the wretch [1]<br>
 Crawling out,<br>
 E'en Atli's mother,<br>
 All sorrow upon her!<br>
 A grave gat her sting<br>
 In the heart of Gunnar,<br>
 So that no helping<br>
 Was left for my hero.<br>
 "O gold-clad woman,<br>
 Full oft I wonder<br>
 How I my life<br>
 Still hold thereafter,<br>
 For methought I loved<br>
 That light in battle,<br>
 The swift with the sword,<br>
 As my very self.<br>
 "Thou hast sat and hearkened<br>
 As I have told thee<br>
 Of many an ill-fate,<br>
 Mine and theirs--<br>
 Each man liveth<br>
 E'en as he may live--<br>
 Now hath gone forth<br>
 The greeting of Oddrun."</p></dir>
