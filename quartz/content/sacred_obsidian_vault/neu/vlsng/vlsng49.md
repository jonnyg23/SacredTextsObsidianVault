 <h1 align="CENTER">THE HELL-RIDE OF BRYNHILD.</h1>
 <p>After the death of Brynhild were made two bales, one for Sigurd, and that was first burned; but Brynhild was burned on the other, and she was in a chariot hung about with goodly hangings.</p>
 <p>And so folk say that Brynhild drave in her chariot down along the way to Hell, and passed by an abode where dwelt a certain giantess, and the giantess spake:--</p>
 <p>THE GIANT-WOMAN:</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"Nay, with my goodwill<br>
 Never goest thou<br>
 Through this stone-pillared<br>
 Stead of mine!<br>
 More seemly for thee<br>
 To sit sewing the cloth,<br>
 Than to go look on<br>
 The love of another.<br>
 "What dost thou, going<br>
 From the land of the Gauls,<br>
 O restless head,<br>
 To this mine house?<br>
 Golden girl, hast thou not,<br>
 If thou listest to hearken,<br>
 In sweet wise from thy hands<br>
 The blood of men washen?"</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>BRYNHILD:</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"Nay, blame me naught,<br>
 Bride of the rock-hall,<br>
 Though I roved a warring<br>
 In the days that were;<br>
 The higher of us twain<br>
 Shall I ever be holden<br>
 When of our kind<br>
 Men make account."</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>THE GIANT-WOMAN</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"Thou, O Brynhild,<br>
 Budli's daughter,<br>
 Wert the worst ever born<br>
 Into the world;<br>
 For Giuki's children<br>
 Death hast thou gotten,<br>
 And turned to destruction<br>
 Their goodly dwelling."</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>BRYNHILD:</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"I shall tell thee<br>
 True tale from my chariot,<br>
 O thou who naught wottest,<br>
 If thou listest to wot;<br>
 How for me they have gotten<br>
 Those heirs of Giuki,<br>
 A loveless life,<br>
 A life of lies.<br>
 "Hild under helm,<br>
 The Hlymdale people,<br>
 E'en those who knew me,<br>
 Ever would call me.<br>
 "The changeful shapes<br>
 Of us eight sisters,<br>
 The wise king bade<br>
 Under oak-tree to bear;<br>
 Of twelve winters was I,<br>
 If thou listest to wot,<br>
 When I sware to the young lord<br>
 Oaths of love.<br>
 "Thereafter gat I<br>
 Mid the folk of the Goths,<br>
 For Helmgunnar the old,<br>
 Swift journey to Hell,<br>
 And gave to Aud's brother<br>
 The young, gain and glory;<br>
 Whereof overwrath<br>
 Waxed Odin with me.<br>
 "So he shut me in shield-wall<br>
 In Skata grove,<br>
 Red shields and white<br>
 Close set around me;<br>
 And bade him alone<br>
 My slumber to break<br>
 Who in no land<br>
 Knew how to fear.<br>
 "He set round my hall,<br>
 Toward the south quarter,<br>
 The Bane of all trees<br>
 Burning aloft;<br>
 And ruled that he only<br>
 Thereover should ride<br>
 Who should bring me the gold<br>
 O'er which Fafnir brooded.<br>
 "Then upon Grani rode<br>
 The goodly gold-strewer<br>
 To where my fosterer<br>
 Ruled his fair dwelling.<br>
 He who alone there<br>
 Was deemed best of all,<br>
 The War-lord of the Danes,<br>
 Well worthy of men.<br>
 "In peace did we sleep<br>
 Soft in one bed,<br>
 As though he had been<br>
 Naught but my brother:<br>
 There as we lay<br>
 Through eight nights wearing,<br>
 No hand in love<br>
 On each other we laid.<br>
 "Yet thence blamed me, Gudrun,<br>
 Giuki's daughter,<br>
 That I had slept<br>
 In the arms of Sigurd;<br>
 And then I wotted<br>
 As I fain had not wotted,<br>
 That they had bewrayed me<br>
 In my betrothals.<br>
 "Ah! For unrest<br>
 All too long<br>
 Are men and women<br>
 Made alive!<br>
 Yet we twain together<br>
 Shall wear through the ages,<br>
 Sigurd and I.--<br>
 Sink adown, O giant-wife!"</p></dir>
