 <p align="center">THE SAYINGS OF KIB</p>  
 <p align="center">(Sender of Life in all the Worlds)</p>  
 <p>Kib said: "I am Kib. I am none other than Kib."</p>  
 <p>Kib is Kib. Kib is he and no other. Believe! Kib said: "When Time was early, when Time was very early indeed—there was only MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI. MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI was before the beginning of the gods, and shall be after their going."</p>  
 <p>And Kib said: "After the going of the gods there will be no small worlds nor big."</p>  
 <p>Kib said: "It will be lonely for MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI."</p>  
 <p>Because this is written, believe! For is it not written, or are you greater than Kib? Kib is Kib.</p>
