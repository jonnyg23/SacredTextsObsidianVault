 <p align="center">YUG THE PROPHET</p>  
 <p>When the Years had carries away Yonath, and Yonath was dead, there was no longer a prophet among men.</p>  
 <p>And still men sought to know.</p>  
 <p>Therefore they said unto Yug: "Be thou our prophet, and know all things, and tell us concerning the wherefore of It All."</p>  
 <p>And Yug said: "I know all things." And men were pleased.</p>  
 <p>And Yug said of the Beginning that it was in Yug's own garden, and of the End that it was in the sight of Yug.</p>  
 <p>And men forgot Yug.</p>  
 <p>One day Yug saw Mung behind the hills making the sign of Mung. And Yug was Yug no more.</p>
