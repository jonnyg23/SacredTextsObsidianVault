 <p>O LOVE, turn from the unchanging sea, and gaze<br> Down these grey slopes upon the year grown old,<br> A-dying mid the autumn-scented haze,<br> That hangeth oer the hollow in the wold,<br> Where the wind-bitten ancient elms infold<br> Grey church, long barn, orchard, and red-roofed stead,<br> Wrought in dead days for men a long while dead.</p>  
 <p>   Come down, O love; may not our hands still meet,<br> Since still we live to-day, forgetting June,<br> Forgetting May, deeming October sweet<br> O hearken, hearken! through the afternoon,<br> The grey tower sings a strange old tinkling tune!<br> Sweet, sweet, and sad, the toiling year's last breath,<br> Too satiate of life to strive with death.</p>  
 <p>   And we toowill it not be soft and kind,<br> That rest from life, from patience and from pain,<br> That rest from bliss we know not when we find,<br> That rest from Love which neer the end can gain?<br> Hark, how the tune swells, that erewhile did wane!<br> Look up, love!ah, cling close and never move!<br> How can I have enough of life and love?</p>

 <p>OCTOBER drew our elders to a house,<br> That mid the tangled vines, and clamorous<br> Glad vintagers, stood calm, slim-pillared, white,<br> As though it fain would hide away from sight<br> The joy that through the sad lost autumn rung.<br> As hot the day was, as when summer hung,<br> With worn feet, on the last step of July,<br> Ashamed to cast its flowery raiment by:<br> Round the old men the white porch-pillars stood,<br> Gold-stained, as with the sun, streaked as with blood,<br> Blood of the earth, at least, and to and fro<br> Before them did the high-girt maidens go,<br> Eager, bright-eyed, and careless of tomorn;<br> And young men with them, nowise made forlorn<br> By love and autumn tide; and in nowise<br> Content to pray for love with hopeless eyes,<br> Close lips, and timid hands; rather, indeed,<br> Lest youth and life should fail them at their need,<br> At what light joyous semblance of him ran<br> Amidst the vines, twixt eyes of maid and man,<br> Wilfully blind they caught.<br>                             But now at last,<br> As in the apple-gathering tide late past,<br> So would the elders do now; in a while,<br> He who should tell the tale, with a grave smile,<br> And eyes fixed on the fairest damsel there, <a name="page_162"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 162</font></a><br> Began to say: "Ye blithe folk well might bear<br> To hearken to a sad tale, yet to-day<br> No heart I have to cast all hope away<br> From out my history: so be warned hereby,<br> Nor wait unto the end, deliciously<br> To nurse your pity; for the end is good<br> And peaceful, howso buffeting and rude<br> Winds, waves, and men were, ere the end was done."</p>  
 <p>   The sweet eyes that his eyes were set upon<br> Were hid by shamefast lids as he did speak,<br> And redder colour burned on her fresh cheek,<br> And her lips smiled, as, with a half-sad sigh,<br> He gan to tell this lovesome history.</p>
