 <p align="center"><i>Refna hears Women talking</i>.</p>  
 <p>SO the days wore with nothing new to tell,<br> Till spring-tide once more on the country fell,<br> Then on a night as Kiartan to his bed<br> Would go, still Refna sat with bowed-down head<br> And stirred not, nor a while would speak, when he<br> Spake to her in kind words and lovingly;<br> At last she lifted up a face, wherein<br> Somewhat did trouble upon sorrow win,<br> And said: <a name="page_473"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 473</font></a><br>              "Indeed of all thy grief I knew,<br> But deemed if still thou sawst me kind and true,<br> Not asking too much, yet not failing aught<br> To show that not far off need love be sought,<br> If thou shouldst need loveif thou sawest all this,<br> Thou wouldst not grudge to show me what a bliss<br> Thy whole love was, by giving unto me<br> As unto one who loved thee silently,<br> Now and again the broken crumbs thereof:<br> Alas! I, having then no part in love,<br> Knew not how nought, nought can allay the soul<br> Of that sad thirst, but love untouched and whole!<br> Kinder than eer I durst have hoped thou art,<br> Forgive me then, that yet my craving heart<br> Is so unsatisfied; I know that thou<br> Art fain to dream that I am happy now,<br> And for that seeming ever do I strive;<br> Thy half-love, dearest, keeps me still alive<br> To love thee; and I bless itbut at whiles"</p>  
 <p>   So far she spake till her weak quivering smiles<br> Faded before the bitterness of love.<br> Her face changed, and her passion gan to move<br> Within her breast until the sobs came fast,<br> And down upon her hands her face she cast,<br> And by the pain of tears her heart did gain<br> A little respite; nor might she refrain<br> From weeping yet, when Kiartan's arms she felt<br> About her, and for long her fair lips dwelt <a name="page_474"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 474</font></a><br> With hungry longing on his lips, and he<br> Spake to her:<br>                  "O poor lover, long may we<br> Live upon earth, till lover and beloved<br> Each is to each, by one desire moved;<br> And whereas thou dost say to me, Forgive,<br> Forgive me rather! A short while to live<br> Once seemed the longest life of man to me,<br> Wherein my love of the old years to see;<br> But could I die now, and be born again<br> To give my whole heart up to ease thy pain,<br> A short while would I choose to live indeed.<br> But is it not so, sweet, that thou hast need<br> To tell me of a thing late seen or heard?<br> Surely by some hap thy dear heart is stirred<br> From out its wonted quiet; ease thine heart<br> And twixt us twain thy fear and grief depart!"</p>  
 <p>   She looked up: "Yea, kind love, I thought to tell<br> Of no great thing that yesterday befell.<br> Why should I vex thee with it? Yet thy fame,<br> If I must say the word, in question came<br> Therein. Yet prithee, mark it not too much!"</p>  
 <p>   He smiled and said: "Nay, be the tidings such<br> As mean my death, speak out and hide not aught!"</p>  
 <p>   She sat a little while, as though she thought<br> How best to speak, then said: "The day being good, <a name="page_475"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 475</font></a><br> About noon yesterday in peaceful mood<br> I wandered by the brook-side, and at last<br> Behind a great grey stone myself I cast,<br> And slept, as fate would have it; when I woke<br> At first I did but note the murmuring brook,<br> But as my hearing and my sight did clear<br> The sound of women's voices did I hear,<br> And in the stream two maidens did I see,<br> Our housefolk, and belike they saw not me,<br> Since I lay low adown, and up the stream<br> Their faces turned; I from a half-sweet dream,<br> I know not what, awaked, no sooner heard<br> Their first word, than sick-hearted and afeard<br> I grew, the cold and evil world to feel<br> So hard it seemed, love, my life to deal:<br> Bitterly clear I saw; as if alone<br> And dead, I saw the world; by a grey stone<br> Within the shallows, washing linen gear<br> They stood; their voices sounded sharp and clear;<br> Half smiles of pleasure and of goodlihead,<br> Shone on their faces, as their rough work sped;<br> O God, how bright the world was!"<br>                                     A flush came<br> Across her face; as stricken by some shame<br> She stammered, when she went on: "Thus their speech,<br> Broken amid their work mine ear did reach<br> As I woke up to care, for the one said,<br> 'Yea, certes, now has Kiartan good end made<br> Of all his troubles, things go well enow.' <a name="page_476"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 476</font></a><br> 'Over well,' said the other, 'didst thou know?'<br> 'Know what?' the first one said, 'What knowst thou then?'<br> 'Nay, nought except the certain talk of men.'<br> 'Well, hear I not men too, what wilt thou say?'<br> She said, 'Men talk that this is latter May,<br> And Kiartan sitteth still and nought is done<br> For the two thefts of Bathstead to atone.'<br> 'Fool!' saith the first one, 'shall all fall to strife<br> For what in no wise maketh worse their life?'<br> 'Well, well, and what will Refna say thereto?<br> Things had been otherwise a while ago;<br> Scarce Kiartan's brother had stripped Gudrun's head<br> Of what she loved, and yet scaped lying dead<br> By this time. Ospak, sure, is safe enow.'<br> 'Ah!' said the other, 'great things sayest thou!'<br> 'True words I speak, when this I say to thee,<br> That glad would Gudrun and our Kiartan be<br> If Bodli Thorleikson and Refna lay<br> Dead on the earth upon the selfsame day;<br> And this from all men's daily talk I draw;<br> <i>Old friends are last to sever</i>, saith the saw.'</p>  
 <p>   "This was the last word that I heard, O love,<br> For from the place softly I gan to move<br> Ere they might see me, and my feet, well taught<br> To know the homeward way, my body brought<br> Unto my bower; yet scarce I saw the way,<br> Rather some place beneath the sod, where lay <a name="page_477"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 477</font></a><br> A few white bones, unnamed, unheeded, while<br> Hard by within this bower twixt word and smile<br> Was breast strained unto breast of twain I knew<br> And needs must part awhile, that I might rue<br> My life, my death, my bitter useless birth.<br> O Kiartan, over-weary seemed the earth<br> Yesterday and to-day; too hard to bear<br> Within thine home to be, and see thee. near,<br> And think that but for very kindness thou<br> Must wish me deadthou didst not note me, how<br> My face was worn with woe throughout that tide,<br> Though most men looked on mefor thou must bide<br> A weary waiting, and thy woe untold<br> Must make thy face at whiles seem hard and cold.<br> Ah me! forgive me that I talk of this!<br> Think how my heart ached!"<br>                                For now kiss on kiss<br> Did Kiartan shower upon her quivering face,<br> Yet, even as their arms did interlace,<br> Despite his love and pity, of past years<br> He needs must think, of wasted sighs and tears<br> And hopes all fallen to nought, and vows undone,<br> And many a pleasure from his life seemed gone;<br> And sorely his heart smote him for her faith<br> So pure and changeless; her love strong as death,<br> As kind as God, that nought should satisfy<br> Till all the shows of earth had passed her by.</p>
