 <p align="center"><i>The Stealing of the Coif</i></p>  
 <p>NOW howso Olaf bade An hold his peace,<br> And Kiartan promised he would nowise cease<br> To show a good face to the world on all<br> That twixt the houses yet might chance to fall,<br> Certain it is, that ere long, far and wide<br> The tale was known, throughout the country-side;<br> Nay, more than this, to Kiartan's ears it came<br> That Oswif's sons deemed they had cast a shame<br> On Herdholt, and must mock him openly<br> And call him 'Mire-blade,' een when those were by<br> Who held him of the most account; no less<br> Kiartan was moved not from his quietness,<br> Nor did aught hap twixt autumn and Yule-tide;<br> Then men at Herdholt busied them to ride<br> To Bathstead once again, and Olaf said: <a name="page_466"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 466</font></a></p>  
 <p>   "Wilt thou once more be guided by my head,<br> Son Kiartan, and with brave heart go to face<br> The troublous things that wait thee in that place?"</p>  
 <p>   "Well," Kiartan said, "if so I deemed, that fate<br> Might be turned back of men, or foolish hate<br> Die out for lack of fuel, no more would I<br> Unto the Bathstead hall-door draw anigh;<br> But forasmuch as now I know full well,<br> That the same story there shall be to tell<br> Whether I go, or whether I refrain,<br> Let all be as thou wilt; and yet we twain<br> Not oft again, O father, side by side<br> Unto this merry-making place shall ride."</p>  
 <p>   Then Olaf sighed, as though indeed he knew<br> To what an end his latter days now drew.</p>  
 <p>   So now all folk were ready there, but when<br> The women came their ways to meet the men,<br> Said Thorgerd unto Refna: "Well, this tide<br> Thou hast the coif, no doubt, and like a bride<br> Hast heart to look midst those whose hearts are cold<br> To thee and thine."<br>                        Then Refna did behold<br> Thorgerd's stern face in trembling wise, and said:<br> "Nay, goodwife, what fair cloth may coif my head<br> Shall matter little mid the many things<br> Men have to talk of: rise and fall of kings <a name="page_467"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 467</font></a><br> And changes of the world: within my chest<br> The coif lies."<br>                "There," said Kiartan, "might it rest<br> For thee and me, sweet; yet I mind indeed<br> When I, a froward child, deemed I had need<br> Of some sharp glittering thing, as axe or knife,<br> But little would my mother raise up strife<br> With me therefor, and even as I would<br> I cut myself: so if she think this good<br> Let fetch the Queen's Gift."<br>                               Refna looked adown<br> Shamefaced and puzzled, Thorgerd with a frown<br> Turned upon Kiartan, but he smiled in turn,<br> And said: "Yea, mother, let the red gold burn<br> Among the lights at Bathstead; great am I<br> Een as thou deemst; and men must let pass by<br> Their hatred to me, whatso say their hearts;<br> Come, open-handed let us play our parts."</p>  
 <p>   So was the coif brought, and once more they rode<br> Unto the door of Oswif's fair abode;<br> And there they feasted merrily enow<br> Such of them as were fools, or cared not how<br> The next week wentand at the highest tide<br> Of all the feast, sat Refna as a bride<br> Coifed with the Queen's Gift; Gudrun stern and cold<br> Scarce would the tender face of her behold,<br> Or cast a look at Kiartan; rather she<br> Did press the hand of Bodli lovingly, <a name="page_468"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 468</font></a><br> Softening her face for him alone of all:<br> Then would strange tumult on his spirit fall,<br> Mingled of pain and uttermost delight<br> To think the whole world had so swerved from right<br> To give him pleasure for a little while,<br> Nor durst he look upon his old friend's smile,<br> Who, glad with his own manhood seemed to be<br> Once more, once more the brave heart frank and free;<br> As though at last the trouble and the coil<br> That wrapped him round, and made him sadly toil<br> Through weary days, had fallen all clean away,<br> And smiling he might meet the bitterest day.</p>  
 <p>   So passed the high-tide forth unto its end<br> But when at last folk from the place would wend,<br> And Refna fain would have the coif of her<br> Whose office was to tend the women's gear<br>  Lo, it was gonethen Refna trembled sore,<br> And passing through the crowd about the door<br> Whispered to Kiartan: Ospak stood anigh<br> And bit his lips, and watched her eagerly,<br> And Kiartan with a side-long glance could see<br> His colour come and go, and cried:<br>                                         "Let be,<br> Light won, light gone! if still it is bove ground,<br> Doubt thou not, Refna, it shall yet be found."<br> Folk looked on one another; Thorgerd said,<br> Turning on Gudrun: "Small account is made <a name="page_469"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 469</font></a><br> Of great folk's gifts, then; I have seen the day<br> When Egil's kin a man or two would slay<br> For things less worth than this."<br>                                  Her angry frown<br> Gudrun met calmly: "Was the thing his own?<br> Then let him do een as he will with it;<br> Small loss it is methinks for her to sit<br> Without his old love's gift upon her head!"<br> Ere Thorgerd answered, Kiartan cried, and said:<br> "Come swift to saddle! Cousin, ride with me,<br> Until we turn the hill anigh the sea;<br> I fain would speak with thee a word or twain<br> That I have striven to think about in vain<br> These last days that we met."<br>                              Bodli flushed red<br> And looked adown: "So be it then," he said.<br> Then stammered and turned pale, and said, "Enow<br> Shall one sword be to-day betwixt us two;<br> Take thou the rover's weapon, O fair wife."</p>  
 <p>   She looked on him, her lovely face was rife<br> With many thoughts, but Kiartan's kindly gaze<br> Seemed to bring back the thoughts of happier days<br> To both of them, and swift away she passed<br> Unto her bower; and men were horsed at last,<br> And sharp the hoofs upon the hard way rung.<br> So as into the saddle Kiartan swung,<br> He leant toward Ospak, and said mockingly: <a name="page_470"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 470</font></a><br> "I love theeI would not that thou shouldst die;<br> So see me not too oft, because I have<br> A plague sometimes, that bringeth to the grave,<br> Those that come nigh me; live on well and whole!"</p>  
 <p>   Then to his face rushed Ospak's envious soul,<br> His hand fell on his sword-hilt as le shrank<br> Back to the doorway, while the fresh air drank<br> Kiartan's clear laughter, as their company<br> Rode jingling down unto the hoary sea.</p>  
 <p>   But the last smile from off his face was gone,<br> When silent, in a while he rode alone<br> With Bodli silent: then he said to him:<br> "Thou seest, Bodli, how we twain must swim<br> Adown a strange streamthou art weaponless<br> To-day, and certes bides my sword no less<br> Within its scabbardhow long shall it last?"</p>  
 <p>   Then Bodli cried, "Until my life is past<br> Shall I take life from thee as well as love?"</p>  
 <p>   "Nay," Kiartan said, "be not too sure thereof,<br> Bethink thee where by thine own deed thou art<br> Betwixt a passionate woman's hungry heart,<br> And the vile envy of a dangerous fool;<br> Doubt not but thou art helpless, and the tool<br> Of thy mad love, and that ill comes from ill,<br> And as a thing begins, so ends it still <a name="page_471"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 471</font></a><br> Nay, not to preach to thee I brought thee here,<br> Rather to say that the old days are dear,<br> Despite of all, unto my weary heart.<br> And now methinks from them and thee I part<br> This day; not unforgiven, whatsoeer<br> Thou at my hands, or I of thine may bear.<br> For I tooshall I guide myself indeed,<br> Or rather be so driven by hard need<br> That still my hand as in a dream shall be,<br> While clearly sees the heart that is in me<br> Desires I may not try to bring to pass?<br> So since no more it may be as it was<br> In the past days, when fair and orderly<br> The world before our footsteps seemed to lie,<br> Now in this welter wherein we are set,<br> Lonely and bare of all, deem we not yet<br> That each for each these ill days we have made;<br> Rather the more let those good words be weighed<br> We spake, when truth and love within us burned,<br> Before the lesson of our life was learned.<br> What say's thou? are the days to come forgiven,<br> Shall folk remember less that we have striven,<br> Than that we loved, when all the tale is told?"</p>  
 <p>   Then long did Bodli Kiartan's face behold,<br> Striving for speech: then said, "Why speakst thou so?<br> Twice over now I seem my deed to do,<br> Twice over strive to wake as from a dream,<br> That I, once happy, never real may deem, <a name="page_472"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 472</font></a><br> So vile and bitter is it; may thy sword<br> If eer we meet be sharper than thy word,<br> And make a speedy end of doubt and strife;<br> Fear not to take much from me, taking life!"</p>  
 <p>   Still seemed the air filled with his words when he<br> Turned back to Bathstead, and the murmuring sea<br> Seemed from afar to speak of rest from pain.<br> Then on a little knoll he shortened rein,<br> And turned about, and looking toward the hill<br> Beheld the spear of Kiartan glittering still,<br> When all the rest of him behind the brow<br> Was sunken; but the spear sank quickly now,<br> And slowly home withal did Bodli ride,<br> Een as he might the coming end to bide.</p>
