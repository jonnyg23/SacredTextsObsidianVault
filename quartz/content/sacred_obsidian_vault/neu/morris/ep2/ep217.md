 <p align="center"><i>Tidings brought to Bathstead of Kiartan's coming back</i>.</p>  
 <p>Yes, there the hills stood, there Lax-river ran<br> Down to the sea; still thrall and serving-man<br> Came home from fold and hayfield to the hall,<br> And still did Olaf's cheery deep voice call<br> Over the mead horns; danced the fiddle-bow,<br> And twanged the harp-strings, and still sweet enow<br> Were measured words, as someone skilled in song<br> Told olden tales of war, and love, and wrong.<br> And Bodli's face from hall and board was gone,<br> And Gudrun's arms were round him, as alone<br> They lay, all unrebuked that hour, unless<br> The dawn, that glimmered on the wretchedness<br> Of Kiartan's lone and sleepless night, should creep<br> Cold-footed oer their well-contented sleep,<br> And whisper, 'Sleep on, lapse of time is here<br> Death's brother, and the very Death is near!'</p>  
 <p>   Such thoughts might haunt the poor deserted man,<br> When through the sky dawn's hopeless shiver ran,<br> And bitterness grew in him, as the day,<br> Cleared of fantastic half-dreams, cold and grey,<br> Was bared before him. Yet I deem, indeed,<br> That they no less of pity had good need.<br> Yea, had his eyes beheld that past high-tide<br> At Bathstead, where sat Gudrun as a bride <a name="page_432"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 432</font></a><br> By Bodli Thorleikson! Her face of yore,<br> So swift to change, as changing thoughts passed oer<br> Her eager heart, set now into a smile<br> That scarce the fools of mankind might beguile<br> To deeming her as happy: his, once calm<br> With dreamy happiness, that would embalm<br> Into sweet memory things of yesterday,<br> And show him pictures of things far away,<br> Now drawn, and fierce, and anxious, still prepared<br> It seemed, to meet the worst his worn heart feared.<br>    A dismal wedding! every ear at strain<br> Some sign of things that were to be to gain;<br> A guard on every tongue lest some old name<br> Should set the poisoned smouldering pile aflame.<br> Silent the fierce dull sons of Oswif drank,<br> And Olaf back into his high seat shrank,<br> And seemed aged wearily, the while his sons<br> Glanced doubtfully at Bodli; more than once<br> Did one of them begin some word to speak,<br> And catch his father's eye, and then must break<br> His speech off with a smile not good or kind;<br> And in meanwhile the wise would fain be blind<br> To all these things, or cover boisterously<br> The seeds of ill they could not fail to see.</p>  
 <p>   But if neath all folk's eyes things went een so,<br> How would it be then with the hapless two<br> The morrow of that feast? This know I well,<br> That upon Bodli the last gate of hell <a name="page_433"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 433</font></a><br> Seemed shut at last, and no more like a star<br> Far off perchance, yet bright however far,<br> Shone hope of better days; yet he lived on,<br> And soon indeed, the worst of all being won,<br> And gleams of frantic pleasure therewithal,<br> A certain quiet on his soul did fall,<br> As though he saw the end and waited it.<br> But over Gudrun changes wild would flit,<br> And sometimes stony would she seem to be;<br> And sometimes would she give short ecstasy<br> To Bodli with a fit of seeming love;<br> And sometimes, as repenting sore thereof,<br> Silent the live-long day would sit and stare,<br> As though she knew some ghost were drawing near,<br> And ere it carne with all the world must break,<br> That she might lose no word it chanced to speak.</p>  
 <p>   So slowly led the changed and weary days<br> Unto the gateway of the silent place,<br> Where either rest or utter change shall be;<br> But on an eve, when summer peacefully<br> Yielded to autumn, as men sat in hall<br> Two wandering churles old Oswif forth did call<br> Into the porch, and asked for shelter there.<br> And since unheeded none might make such prayer,<br> Soon mid the boisterous house-carles were they set,<br> The ugly turns of fortune to forget<br> In mirth and ease, and still with coarse rude jest<br> They pleased the folk, and laughed out with the best. <a name="page_434"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 434</font></a><br> But while the lower hall of mirth was full<br> More than their wont the great folk there were dull;<br> Oswif was sunk in thought of other days,<br> And Gudrun's tongue idly some tale did praise<br> Her brother Ospak told, the while her heart<br> Midst vain recurring hopes was set apart;<br> And Bodli looked as though he still did bide<br> The coming fate it skilled no more to hide<br> From his sore wearied heart: no more there were<br> Upon the dais that eve; but when the cheer<br> Was over now, old Oswif went his ways,<br> But Ospak sat awhile within his place<br> Staring at Bodli with a look of scorn;<br> For much he grew to hate that face forlorn,<br> Bowed down with cares he might not understand.</p>  
 <p>   At last midst Gudrun's talk, with either hand<br> Stretched out did Ospak yawn, and cried aloud<br> Unto the lower table's merry crowd:<br> "Well fare ye, fellows! ye are glad to-night;<br> What thing is it that brings you such delight?<br> We be not merry here."<br>                         Then one stepped forth,<br> And said: "Sooth, Ospak, but of little worth<br> Our talk was; yet these wandering churles are full<br> Of meat and drink, and need no rope to pull<br> Wild words and gleesome from them."<br>                                    "Bring them here,"<br> Said Ospak, "they may mend our doleful cheer." <a name="page_435"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 435</font></a></p>  
 <p>   So from the lower end they came, ill clad,<br> Houseless, unwashen, yet with faces glad,<br> If for a while; yet somewhat timorous, too,<br> With such great men as these to have to do,<br> Although to fear was drink a noble shield.</p>  
 <p>   "Well, fellows, what fair tidings are afield?"<br> Said Ospak, "and whence come ye?"<br>                                          The first man<br> Turned leering eyes on Bodli's visage wan,<br> And oer his face there spread a cunning grin.<br> But just as he his first word would begin,<br> The other, drunker, and a thought more wise<br> Maybe for that, said, screwing up his eyes,<br> "Say-all-you-know shall go with clouted head."</p>  
 <p>   "Say-nought-at-all is beaten," Ospak said,<br> "If, with his belly full of great men's meat<br> He has no care to make his speeches sweet."</p>  
 <p>   "Be not wrath, son of Oswif," said the first;<br> "Now I am full I care not for the worst<br> That haps to-night; yet Mistress Gudrun there"</p>  
 <p>   "Tush!" said the second, "thou art full of care<br> For a man full of drink. Come, let her say<br> That as we came so shall we go away,<br> And all is soon told."<br>                       Ospak laughed thereat, <a name="page_436"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 436</font></a><br> As sprawling oer the laden board he sat,<br> His cheek close to his cup; but Gudrun turned<br> Unto him, pale, although her vexed heart burned<br> With fresh desire, and a great agony<br> Of hope strove in her.<br>                          "Tell thy tale to me<br> And have a gift therefor," she said: "behold!<br> My finger is no better for this gold!<br> Draw it off swiftly!"<br>                       Then she reached her hand<br> Out to the man, who wondering there did stand<br> Beholding it, half sobered by her face;<br> Nor durst he touch the ring.<br>                                "Unto this place<br> From Burgfirth did we come," he said, "and there,<br> Around a new-beached ship folk held a fair<br> Kálf Asgeirson, men said, the skipper was<br> But others to and fro did I see pass."</p>  
 <p>   Still Ospak chuckled, lolling oer his drink,<br> Nor any whit hereat did Gudrun shrink,<br> But Bodli rose up, and the hall gan pace,<br> As on the last time when in that same place<br> Kiartan and he and she together were;<br> And on this day of anguish and of fear,<br> Well-nigh his weary heart began to deem<br> That that past day did but begin a dream<br> From which he needs must wake up presently,<br> Those lovers in each other's arms to see, <a name="page_437"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 437</font></a><br> To feel himself heart-whole and innocent;<br> "Yea, yea, a many people came and went<br> About the ship," he heard the first guest say;<br> "Gudmund and Thurid did I see that day,<br> And Asgeir and his daughter, and they stood<br> About a man, whose kirtle, red as blood,<br> Was fine as a king's raiment."<br>                                Ospak here<br> Put up his left hand slowly to his ear,<br> As one who hearkens, smiling therewithal,<br> And now there fell a silence on the hall,<br> As the man said:<br>                   "I had not seen before<br> This fair tall man, who in his sword-belt bore<br> A wondrous weapon, gemmed, and wrought with gold;<br> Too mean a man I was to be so bold<br> As in that place to ask about his name.<br> Yet certes, mistress, to my mind it came,<br> That, if tales lied not, this was even he<br> Men said should wed a bride across the sea<br> And be a kingeen Kiartan Olafson."</p>  
 <p>   He looked about him when his speech was done<br> As one who feareth somewhat, but the word<br> He last had said, nought new belike had stirred<br> In those three hearts; Bodli still paced the floor<br> With downcast eyes, that sometimes to the door<br> Were lifted; Ospak beat upon the board<br> A swift tune with his hand; without a word <a name="page_438"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 438</font></a><br> The gold ring from her finger Gudrun drew<br> And gave it to the man; and Ospak knew<br> A gift of Bodli Thorleikson therein,<br> Given when first her promise he did win.<br> Yet little wisdom seemed it to those men<br> About the dais to abide as then,<br> Though one turned oer his shoulder as he went,<br> And saw how Ospak unto Gudrun leant<br> And nodded head at Bodli, and meanwhile<br> Thrust his forefinger with a mocking smile<br> At his own breast; but Gudrun saw him not,<br> Though their eyes met, nay, rather scarce had got<br> A thought of Bodli in her heart, for still<br> 'Kiartan come back again,' her soul did fill,<br> 'And I shall see him soon, with what changed eyes!'</p>  
 <p>   And now did night oer the world's miseries<br> Draw her dark veil, yet men with stolen light<br> Must win from restless day a restless night;<br> Then Gudrun gan bestir her, with a smile<br> Talking of common things a little while,<br> For Bodli to his seat had come again<br> And sat him down, though labour spent in vain<br> It was to speak to him; dull the night went,<br> And there the most of men were well content<br> When bed-time came at last. Then one by one<br> They left the hall till Bodli sat alone<br> Within the high-seat. No thought then he had<br> Clear to himself, except that all was bad <a name="page_439"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 439</font></a><br> That henceforth was to come to him; the night<br> Went through its changes, light waned after light,<br> Until but one was left far down the hall<br> Casting a feeble circle on the wall,<br> Making the well-known things as strange as death;<br> Then through the windows came the night's last breath,<br> And gainst the yellow glimmer they showed blue<br> As the late summer dawn oer Iceland drew;<br> And still he sat there, noting nought at all<br> Till at his back he heard a light footfall,<br> And fell a-trembling, yet he knew not why;<br> Nor durst he turn to look, till presently<br> He knew a figure was beside him, white<br> In the half dusk of the departing night,<br> For the last light had died; therewith he strove<br> To cry aloud, and might not, his tongue clove<br> Unto his mouth, no power he had to stand<br> Upon his feet, he might not bring his hand,<br> How much soeer he tried, to his sword's hilt;<br> It seemed to him his sorrow and his guilt<br> Stood there in bodily form before his eyes,<br> Yet, when a dreadful voice did now arise<br> He knew that Gudrun spake:<br>                                   "I came again<br> Because I lay awake, and thought how men<br> Have told of traitors, and I needs must see<br> How such an one to-night would look to me.<br> Night hides thee not, O Bodli Thorleikson,<br> Nor shall death hide from thee what thou hast done. <a name="page_440"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 440</font></a><br> What!thou art grown afraid, thou tremblest then<br> Because I name death, seed of fearless men?<br> Fear not, I bear no sword, Kiartan is kind,<br> He will not slay thee because he was blind<br> And took thee for a true man time a-gone.<br> My curse upon thee! Knowst thou how alone<br> Thy deed hath made me? Dreamest thou what pain<br> Burns in me now when he has come again?<br> Now, when the longed-for sun has risen at last<br> To light an empty world whence all has passed<br> Of joy and hopegreat is thy gain herein I<br> A bitter broken thing to seem to win,<br> A soul the fruit of lies shall yet make vile;<br> A body for thy base lust to defile,<br> If thou durst come anigh me any more,<br> Now I have curst thee, that thy mother bore<br> So base a wretch among good men to dwell,<br> That thou mightst build me up this hot-walled hell.<br> I curse thee now, while good and evil strive<br> Within me, but if longer I shall live<br> What shall my curse be then? myself so curst,<br> That nought shall then be left me but the worst,<br> That God shall mock himself for making me."</p>  
 <p>   Breathless she stopped, but Bodli helplessly<br> Put forth his hands till he gained speech, and said<br> In a low voice, "Would God that I were dead!<br> And yet a word from him I hope to have<br> Kinder than this before I reach the grave!" <a name="page_441"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 441</font></a></p>  
 <p>   "Yea, he is kind, yea, he is kind!" she cried,<br> "He loveth all, and casts his kindness wide<br> Even as God; nor loves me more than God<br> Loves one among us crawlers oer earth's sod.<br> And who knows how I love him? how I hate<br> Each face on which he looks compassionate!<br> God help me! I am talking of my love<br> To thee! and such a traitor I may prove<br> As thou hast, ere the tale is fully done."</p>  
 <p>   She turned from him therewith to get her gone,<br> But lingered yet, as waiting till he spake.<br> Day dawned apace, the sparrows gan to wake<br> Within the eaves; the trumpet of the swan<br> Sounded from far; the morn's cold wind, that ran<br> Oer the hall's hangings, reached her unbound hair,<br> And drave the night-gear round her body fair,<br> And stirred the rushes by her naked feet:<br> Most fair she wastheir eyes a while did meet,<br> In a strange look, he rose with haggard face<br> And trembling lips, that body to embrace,<br> For which all peace for ever he had lost,<br> But wildly oer her head her arms she tossed,<br> And with one dreadful look she fled away<br> And left him twixt the dark night and the day,<br> Twixt good and ill, twixt love and struggling hate,<br> The coming hours of restless pain to wait. <a name="page_442"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 442</font></a></p>

 <p align="center"><i>The Yule feast at Bathstead</i>.</p>  
 <p>NOW the days wore, and nowise Kiartan stirred,<br> Or seemed as he would stir, and no man heard<br> Speech from him of the twain, for good or ill;<br> Yet was his father Olaf anxious still,<br> And doubted that the smouldering fire might blaze,<br> For drearily did Kiartan pass his days<br> After a while, and ever silently<br> Would sit and watch the weary sun go by,<br> Feeling as though the heart in him were dead.</p>  
 <p>   Kálf Asgeirson came to the Peacock's stead<br> With Refna, more than once that autumn-tide;<br> And at the last folk gan to whisper wide<br> That she was meet for him, if anyone<br> Might now mate Kiartan, since Gudrun was gone.<br> If Kiartan heard this rumour I know not,<br> But Refna heard it and her heart waxed hot<br> With foolish hopes; for one of those she was<br> Who seem across the weary earth to pass,<br> That they may show what burden folk may bear<br> Of unrequited love, nor drawing near<br> The goal they aim at, die amidst the noise<br> Of clashing lusts with scarce-complaining voice.<br> God wot that Kiartan in his bitter need<br> To her kind eyes could pay but little heed;<br> Yet did he note that she looked kind on him, <a name="page_443"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 443</font></a><br> Nor yet had all his kindness grown so dim<br> That he might pass her by all utterly,<br> And thereof came full many a biting lie.<br>    Now as the time drew on toward Yule once more,<br> Did Oswif send, as his wont was of yore,<br> To bid the men of Herdholt to the feast;<br> And howso things had changed, both most and least<br> Gan make them ready, all but Kiartan, who<br> That morn went wandering aimless to and fro<br> Amid the bustling groups, and spake no word.<br> To whom came Olaf when thereof he heard,<br> And spake with anxious face: "O noble son,<br> Wilt thou still harbour wrath for what is done?<br> Nay, let the past be past; young art thou yet,<br> And many another honour mayst thou get,<br> And many another love."<br>                           Kiartan turned round,<br> And said, "Yea, good sooth, love doth much abound<br> In this kind world! Lo! one more loved my love<br> Than I had deemed ofthus it oft shall prove!"</p>  
 <p>   So spake he sneering and high-voiced, then said,<br> As he beheld his father's grizzled head<br> And puckered brow: "What wouldst thou, father? see<br> Here in thy house do I sit quietly,<br> And let all folk live even suchlike life<br> As they love best; and wilt thou wake up strife?"</p>  
 <p>   "Nay, nay, son; but thou knowest that thy mood, <a name="page_444"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 444</font></a><br> So lonely here, shall bring thee little good;<br> Thy grief grows greater as thou nursest it,<br> Nor neath thy burden ever shalt thou sit<br> As it increases on thee; then shall come<br> A dreadful tale on this once happy home.<br> Come rather, show all men thou wilt have peace<br> By meeting them, and it shall bring thee ease,<br> That sight once over, to think how thou art<br> A brave man still, not sitting with crushed heart<br> Amid the stirring world."<br>                          Then Kiartan gazed<br> Long on his father, as a man amazed,<br> But said at last: "Ah, thou must have thy will!<br> God wot I looked that the long days would kill<br> This bitter longing, if unfed it were<br> By sights and sounds. Now let the long days bear<br> Their fated burden! I will go with thee."</p>  
 <p>   So like a dreaming man did Kiartan see<br> That place which once seemed holy in his eyes;<br> No cry of fury to his lips did rise<br> When oer the threshold first he went, and saw<br> Bodli the son of Thorleik towards him draw,<br> Blood-red for shame at first, then pale for shame,<br> As from his lips the old kind speeches came,<br> And hand met hand. Coldly he spake, and said:</p>  
 <p>   "Be merry, Bodli; thou art nobly wed! <a name="page_445"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 445</font></a><br> Thou hadst the toil, and now the due reward<br> Is fallen to thee."<br>                   Then, like a cutting sword,<br> A sharp pain pierced him, as he saw far off<br> Gudrun's grey eyes turn, with a spoken scoff,<br> To meet his own; and there the two men stood,<br> Each knowing somewhat of the other's mood,<br> Yet scarce the master-key thereto; still stared<br> Kiartan at Gudrun; and his heart grew hard<br> With his despair: but toward him Bodli yearned,<br> As one who well that bitter task had learned;<br> And now he reached once more to him his hand,<br> But moveless for a while did Kiartan stand,<br> And had in heart to get him back again:<br> Yet with strong will he put aback his pain,<br> And passed by Bodli, noting him no whit,<br> And coldly at the feast that day did sit,<br> In outward seeming; and Gudrun no less<br> Sat in her place in perfect loveliness,<br> Untouched by passion: Bodli in meanwhile<br> From Kiartan's grave brow unto Gudrun's smile<br> Kept glancing, and in feverish eager wise<br> Strove to pierce through the mask of bitter lies<br> That hid the bitter truth; and still must fear,<br> Lest from the feast's noise he a shriek should hear,<br> When the thin dream-veil, torn across, should show<br> That in the very hell he lay alow.</p>  
 <p>   Men say that when the guests must leave the place, <a name="page_446"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 446</font></a><br> Bodli with good gifts many a man did grace,<br> And at the last bade bring up to the door<br> Three goodly horses such as neer before<br> Had Iceland seen, and turned his mournful eyes<br> To Kiartan's face, stern with the memories<br> Of many a past departing, bitter-sweet,<br> And said:<br>          "O cousin, O my friend, unmeet<br> Is aught that here I have, for thy great fame,<br> Yet if it please thee still to be the same<br> As thou hast been to us, take these of me."</p>  
 <p>   But as men crowded round about to see<br> The goodly steeds, spake Kiartan in low voice:<br> "Strive not with fate, for thou hast made thy choice;<br> Thy gifts, thy love, may scarce now heal my heart<br> Look not so kindGod keep us well apart!"</p>  
 <p>   No more they spake as then, but straightway rode<br> The Herdholt men unto their fair abode;<br> And so it fell that on the homeward way<br> Gan Olaf to his well-loved son to say:</p>  
 <p>   "Kiartan, howeer the heart in thee did burn,<br> Unto no evil did this meeting turn;<br> Yet would that thou hadst taken gifts from him!<br> Now thou wilt go again?"<br>                           "My eyes are dim,<br> Belike, O father, with my bitter pain;<br> Yet doubt thou not but I shall go again, <a name="page_447"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 447</font></a><br> Een as I doubt not that fresh misery<br> I there shall gather as the days pass by.<br> Would I could tell thee all I think, and how<br> I deem thy wise hand dreadful seed doth sow!"</p>
