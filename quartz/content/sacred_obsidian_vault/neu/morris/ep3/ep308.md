 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>The Earthly Paradise, (December-February)</i>, by William Morris, [1870], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>

 <p>NOONand the north-west sweeps the empty road,<br> The rain-washed fields from hedge to hedge are bare;<br> Beneath the leafless elms some hind's abode<br> Looks small and void, and no smoke meets the air<br> From its poor hearth: one lonely rook doth dare<br> The gale, and beats above the unseen corn,<br> Then turns, and whirling down the wind is borne.</p>  
 <p>   Shall it not hap that on some dawn of May<br> Thou shalt awake, and, thinking of days dead,<br> See nothing clear but this same dreary day,<br> Of all the days that have passed oer thine head?<br> Shalt thou not wonder, looking from thy bed,<br> Through green leaves on the windless east a-fire,<br> That this day too thine heart doth still desire?</p>  
 <p>   Shalt thou not wonder that it liveth yet,<br> The useless hope, the useless craving pain,<br> That made thy face, that lonely noontide, wet<br> With more than beating of the chilly rain?<br> Shalt thou not hope for joy new born again,<br> Since no grief ever born can ever die<br> Through changeless change of seasons passing by? <a name="page_232"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 232</font></a></p>

 <p>THE change has come at last, and from the west<br> Drives on the wind, and gives the clouds no rest,<br> And ruffles up the water thin that lies<br> Over the surface of the thawing ice;<br> Sunrise and sunset with no glorious show<br> Are seen, as late they were across the snow;<br> The wet-lipped west wind chilleth to the bone<br> More than the light and flickering east hath done.<br> Full soberly the earth's fresh hope begins,<br> Nor stays to think of what each new day wins:<br> And still it seems to bid us turn away<br> From this chill thaw to dream of blossomed May:<br> Een as some hapless lover's dull shame sinks<br> Away sometimes in day-dreams, and he thinks<br> No more of yesterday's disgrace and foil,<br> No more he thinks of all the sickening toil<br> Of piling straw on straw to reach the sky;<br> But rather now a pitying face draws nigh,<br> Mid tears and prayers for pardon; and a tale<br> To make love tenderer now is all the bale<br> Love brought him erst.<br>                           But on this chill dank tide<br> Still are the old men by the fireside,<br> And all things cheerful round the day just done<br> Shut out the memory of the cloud-drowned sun, <a name="page_233"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 233</font></a><br> And dripping bough and blotched and snow-soaked earth;<br> And little as the tide seemed made for mirth,<br> Scarcely they lacked it less than months agone,<br> When on their wrinkles bright the great sun shone;<br> Rather, perchance, less pensive now they were,<br> And meeter for that cause old tales to hear<br> Of stirring deeds long dead:<br>                              So, as it fell,<br> Preluding nought, an elder gan to tell<br> The story promised in mid-winter days<br> Of all that latter end of bliss and praise<br> That erst befell Bellerophon the bright,<br> Ere all except his name sank into night.</p>
