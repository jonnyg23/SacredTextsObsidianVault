 <p><font size="-1">THIS tale tells of the voyage of a ship of Tyre, that, against the will of the shipmen, bore Hercules to an unknown land of the West, that he might accomplish a task laid on him by the Fates.</font></p>  
 <p>AS many as the leaves fall from the tree,<br> From the world's life the years are fallen away<br> Since King Eurystheus sat in majesty<br> In fair Mycenæ; midmost of whose day<br> It once befell that in a quiet bay<br> A ship of Tyre was swinging nigh the shore,<br> Her folk for sailing handling rope and oar.</p>  
 <p>   Fresh was the summer morn, a soft wind stole<br> Down from the sheep-browsed slopes the cliffs that crowned,<br> And ruffled lightly the long gleaming roll<br> Of the peaceful sea, and bore along the sound<br> Of shepherd-folk and sheep and questing hound;<br> For in the first dip of the hillside there<br> Lay bosomed mid its trees a homestead fair.</p>  
 <p>   Amid regrets for last night, when the moon,<br> Risen on the soft dusk, shone on maidens feet <a name="page_6"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 6</font></a><br> Brushing the gold-heart lilies to the tune<br> Of pipes complaining, oer the grass down-beat<br> That mixed with dewy flowers its odour sweet,<br> The shipmen laboured, till the sail unfurled<br> Swung round the prow to meet another world.</p>  
 <p>   But ere the anchor had come home, a shout<br> Rang from the strand, as though the ship were hailed.<br> Whereat the master bade them stay, in doubt<br> That they without some needful thing had sailed;<br> When, to! from where the cliffs' steep grey sides failed<br> Into a ragged stony slip, came twain<br> Who seemed in haste the ready keel to gain.</p>  
 <p>   Soon they drew nigh, and he who first came down<br> Unto the surf was a man huge of limb,<br> Grey-eyed, with crisp-curled hair twixt black and brown,<br> Who had a lion's skin cast over him,<br> So wrought with gold that the fell showed but dim<br> Betwixt the threads, and in his hand he bore<br> A mighty club with bands of steel done oer.</p>  
 <p>   Panting there followed him a grey old man,<br> Bearing a long staff; clad in gown of blue,<br> Feeble of aspect, hollow-cheeked and wan,<br> Who when unto his fellow's side he drew,<br> Said faintly: "Now, do that which thou shouldst do;<br> This is the ship." Then in the other's eye<br> A smile gleamed, and he spake out merrily: <a name="page_7"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 7</font></a></p>  
 <p>   "Masters, folk tell me that ye make for Tyre,<br> And after that still nearer to the sun;<br> And since Fate bids me look to die by fire,<br> Fain am I, ere my worldly day be done,<br> To know what from earth's hottest can be won;<br> And this old man, my kinsman, would with me.<br> How say ye, will ye bear us oer the sea?"</p>  
 <p>   "What is thy name?" the master said: "And know<br> That we are merchants, and for nought give nought;<br> What wilt thou pay?thou seemst full rich, I trow."<br> The old man muttered, stooped adown and caught<br> At something in the sand: "Een so I thought,"<br> The younger said, "when I set out from home<br> As to my name, perchance in days to come</p>  
 <p>   "Thou shalt know thatbut have heed, take this toy,<br> And call me the Strong Man." And as he spake<br> The master's deep-brown eyes gan gleam with joy,<br> For from his arm a huge ring did he take,<br> And cast it on the deck, where it did break<br> A water-jar, and in the wet shards lay<br> Golden, and gleaming like the end of day.</p>  
 <p>   But the old man held out a withered hand,<br> Wherein there shone two pearls most great and fair,<br> And said, "If any nigher I might stand,<br> Then mightst thou see the things I give thee here<a name="page_8"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 8</font></a><br> And for namea many names I bear,<br> But call me Shepherd of the Shore this tide,<br> And for more knowledge with a good will bide."</p>  
 <p>   From one to the other turned the master's eyes;<br> The Strong Man laughed as at some hidden jest,<br> And wild doubts in the shipman's heart did rise;<br> But thinking on the thing, he deemed it best<br> To bid them come aboard, and take such rest<br> As they might have of the untrusty sea,<br> Mid men who trusty fellows still should be.</p>  
 <p>   Then no more words the Strong Man made, but straight<br> Caught up the elder in his arms, and so,<br> Making no whit of all that added weight,<br> Strode to the ship, right through the breakers low,<br> And catching at the rope that they did throw<br> Out toward his hand, swung up into the ship:<br> Then did the master let the hawser slip.</p>  
 <p>   The shapely prow cleft the wet mead and green,<br> And wondering drew the shipmen round to gaze<br> Upon those limbs, the mightiest ever seen;<br> And many deemed it no light thing to face<br> The splendour of his eyen, though they did blaze<br> With no wrath now, no hate for them to dread,<br> As seaward twixt the summer isles they sped. <a name="page_9"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 9</font></a></p>  
 <p>   Freshened the wind, but ever fair it blew<br> Unto the south-east; but as failed the land,<br> Unto the plunging prow the Strong Man drew,<br> And silent, gazing with wide eyes did stand,<br> As though his heart found rest; but mid the band<br> Of shipmen in the stern the old man sat,<br> Telling them tales that no man there forgat.</p>  
 <p>   As one who had beheld, he told them there<br> Of the sweet singer, who, for his song's sake,<br> The dolphins back from choking death did bear;<br> How in the mid sea did the vine outbreak<br> Oer that ill bark when Bacchus gan to wake;<br> How anigh Cyprus, ruddy with the rose<br> The cold sea grew as any June-loved close;</p>  
 <p>   While on the flowery shore all things alive<br> Grew faint with sense of birth of some delight,<br> And the nymphs waited trembling there, to give<br> Glad welcome to the glory of that sight:<br> He paused then, ere he told how, wild and white,<br> Rose ocean, breaking oer a race accurst,<br> A world once good, now come unto its worst.</p>  
 <p>   And then he smiled, and said, "And yet ye won,<br> Ye men, and tremble not on days like these,<br> Nor think with what a mind Prometheus son<br> Beheld the last of the torn reeling trees <a name="page_10"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 10</font></a><br> From high Parnassus: slipping through the seas<br> Ye never think, ye men-folk, how ye seem<br> From down below through the green waters gleam."</p>  
 <p>   Dusk was it now when these last words he said,<br> And little of his visage might they see,<br> But oer their hearts stole vague and troublous dread,<br> They knew not why; yet ever quietly<br> They sailed that night; nor might a morning be<br> Fairer than was the next morn; and they went<br> Along their due course after their intent.</p>  
 <p>   The fourth day, about sunrise, from the mast<br> The watch cried out he saw Phnician land;<br> Whereat the Strong Man on the elder cast<br> A look askance, and he straight took his stand<br> Anigh the prow, and gazed beneath his hand<br> Upon the low sun and the scarce-seen shore,<br> Till cloud-flecks rose, and gathered and drew oer.</p>  
 <p>   The morn grown cold; then small rain gan to fall,<br> And all the wind dropped dead, and hearts of men<br> Sank, and their bark seemed helpless now and small;<br> Then suddenly the wind gan moan again;<br> Sails flapped, and ropes beat wild about; and then<br> Down came the great east wind; and the ship ran<br> Straining, heeled oer, through seas all changed and<br> wan. <a name="page_11"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 11</font></a></p>  
 <p>   Westward, scarce knowing night from day, they drave<br> Through sea and sky grown one; the Strong Man wrought<br> With mighty hands, and seemed a god to save;<br> But on the prow, heeding all weather nought,<br> The elder stood, nor any prop he sought,<br> But swayed to the ship's wallowing, as on wings<br> He there were set above the wrack of things.</p>  
 <p>   And westward still they drave; and if they saw<br> Land upon either side, as on they sped,<br> Twas but as faces in a dream may draw<br> Anigh, and fade, and leave nought in their stead;<br> And in the shipmen's hearts grew heavy dread<br> To sick despair; they deemed they should drive on<br> Till the world's edge and empty space were won.</p>  
 <p>   But neath the Strong Man's eyes een as they might<br> They toiled on still; and he sang to the wind,<br> And spread his arms to meet the waters white,<br> As oer the deck they tumbled, making blind<br> The brine-drenched shipmen; nor with eye unkind<br> He gazed up at the lightning; nor would frown<br> When oer the wet waste Jove's bolt rattled down.</p>  
 <p>   And they, who at the last had come to think<br> Their guests were very gods, with all their fear <a name="page_12"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 12</font></a><br> Feared nought belike that their good ship would sink<br> Amid the storm; but rather looked to hear<br> The last moan of the wind that them should bear<br> Into the windless stream of ocean grey,<br> Where they should float till dead was every day.</p>  
 <p>   Yet their fear mocked them; for the storm gan die<br> About the tenth day, though unto the west<br> They drave on still; soon fair and quietly<br> The morn would break; and though amid their rest<br> Nought but long evil wandering seemed the best<br> That they might hope for; still, despite their dread,<br> Sweet was the quiet sea and goodlihead</p>  
 <p>   Of the bright sun at last come back again;<br> And as the days passed, less and less fear grew,<br> If without cause, till faded all their pain;<br> And they gan turn unto their guests anew,<br> Yet durst ask nought of what that evil drew<br> Upon their heads; or of returning speak.<br> Happy they felt, but listless, spent, and weak.</p>  
 <p>   And now as at the first the elder was,<br> And sat and told them tales of yore agone;<br> But ever the Strong Man up and down would pass<br> About the deck, or on the prow alone<br> Would stand and stare out westward; and still on<br> Through a fair summer sea they went, nor thought<br> Of what would come when these days turned to nought. <a name="page_13"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 13</font></a></p>  
 <p>   And now when twenty days were well passed oer<br> They made a new land; cloudy mountains high<br> Rose from the sea at first; then a green shore<br> Spread fair below them: as they drew anigh<br> No sloping, stony strand could they espy,<br> And no surf breaking; the green sea and wide<br> Wherethrough they slipped was driven by no tide.</p>  
 <p>   Dark fell ere they might set their eager feet<br> Upon the shore; but night-long their ship lay<br> As in a deep stream, by the blossoms sweet<br> That flecked the grass whence flowers neer passed away.<br> But when the cloud-barred east brought back the day,<br> And turned the western mountain-tops to gold,<br> Fresh fear the shipmen in their bark did hold.</p>  
 <p>   For as a dream seemed all; too fair for those<br> Who needs must die; moreover they could see,<br> A furlong off, twixt apple-tree and rose,<br> A brazen wall that gleamed out wondrously<br> In the young sun, and seemed right long to be;<br> And memory of all marvels lay upon<br> Their shrinking hearts now this sweet place was won.</p>  
 <p>   But when unto the nameless guests they turned,<br> Who stood together nigh the plank shot out<br> Shoreward, within the Strong Man's eyes there burned<br> A wild light, as the other one in doubt <a name="page_14"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 14</font></a><br> He eyed a moment; then with a great shout<br> Leaped into the blossomed grass; the echoes rolled<br> Back from the hills, harsh still and over-bold.</p>  
 <p>   Slowly the old man followed him, and still<br> The crew held back: they knew now they were brought<br> Over the sea the purpose to fulfil<br> Of these strange men; and in their hearts they thought,<br> "Perchance we yet shall live, if, meddling nought<br> With dreams, we bide here till these twain come back;<br> But prying eyes the fire-blast seldom lack."</p>  
 <p>   Yet mongst them were two fellows bold and young,<br> Who, looking each upon the other's face,<br> Their hearts to meet the unknown danger strung,<br> And went ashore, and at a gentle pace<br> Followed the strangers, who unto the place<br> Where the wall gleamed had turned; peace and desire<br> Mingled together in their hearts, as nigher</p>  
 <p>   They drew unto that wall, and dulled their fear:<br> Fair wrought it was, as though with bricks of brass;<br> And images upon its face there were,<br> Stories of things a long while come to pass:<br> Nor that aloneas looking in a glass<br> Its maker knew the tales of what should be,<br> And wrought them there for bird and beast to see. <a name="page_15"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 15</font></a></p>  
 <p>   So on they went; the many birds sang sweet<br> Through all that blossomed thicket from above,<br> And unknown flowers bent down before their feet;<br> The very air, cleft by the grey-winged dove,<br> Throbbed with sweet scent, and smote their souls with love.<br> Slowly they went till those twain stayed before<br> A strangely-wrought and iron-covered door.</p>  
 <p>   They stayed, too, till oer noise of wind, and bird,<br> And falling flower, there rang a mighty shout<br> As the Strong Man his steel-bound club upreared,<br> And drave it gainst the hammered iron stout,<br> Where neath his blows flew bolt and rivet out,<br> Till shattered on the ground the great door lay,<br> And into the guarded place bright poured the day.</p>  
 <p>   The Strong Man entered, but his fellow stayed,<br> Leaning against a tree-trunk as they deemed.<br> They faltered now, and yet all things being weighed<br> Went on again; and thought they must have dreamed<br> Of the old man, for now the sunlight streamed<br> Full on the tree he had been leaning on,<br> And him they saw not go, yet was he gone:</p>  
 <p>   Only a slim green lizard flitted there<br> Amidst the dry leaves; him they noted nought,<br> But trembling, through the doorway gan to peer,<br> And still of strange and dreadful saw not aught, <a name="page_16"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 16</font></a><br> Only a garden fair beyond all thought.<br> And there, twixt sun and shade, the Strong Man went<br> On some long-sought-for end belike intent.</p>  
 <p>   They gan to follow down a narrow way<br> Of green-sward that the lilies trembled oer,<br> And whereon thick the scattered rose-leaves lay;<br> But a great wonder weighed upon them sore,<br> And well they thought they should return no more,<br> Yet scarce a pain that seemed; they looked to meet<br> Before they died things strange and fair and sweet.</p>  
 <p>   So still to right and left the Strong Man thrust<br> The blossomed boughs, and passed on steadily,<br> As though his hardy heart he well did trust,<br> Till in a while he gave a joyous cry,<br> And hastened on, as though the end drew nigh;<br> And women's voices then they deemed they heard,<br> Mixed with a noise that made desire afeard.</p>  
 <p>   Yet through sweet scents and sounds on did they bear<br> Their panting hearts, till the path ended now<br> In a wide space of green, a streamlet clear<br> From out a marble basin there did flow,<br> And close by that a slim-trunked tree did grow,<br> And on a bough low oer the water cold<br> There hung three apples of red-gleaming gold. <a name="page_17"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 17</font></a></p>  
 <p>   About the tree, new risen een now to meet<br> The shining presence of that mighty one,<br> Three damsels stood, naked from head to feet<br> Save for the glory of their hair, where sun<br> And shadow flickered, while the wind did run<br> Through the grey leaves oerhead, and shook the grass<br> Where nigh their feet the wandering bee did pass.</p>  
 <p>   But midst their delicate limbs and all around<br> The tree-roots, gleaming blue black could they see<br> The spires of a great serpent, that, enwound<br> About the smooth bole, looked-forth threateningly,<br> With glittering eyes and raised crest, oer the three<br> Fair heads fresh crowned, and hissed above the speech<br> Wherewith they murmured softly each to each.</p>  
 <p>   Now the Strong Man amid the green space stayed,<br> And, leaning on his club, with eager eyes<br> But brow yet smooth, in voice yet friendly said:<br> "O daughters of old Hesperus the Wise,<br> Well have ye held your guard here; but time tries<br> The very will of gods, and to my hand<br> Must give this day the gold fruit of your land."</p>  
 <p>   Then spake the first maidsweet as the west wind<br> Amidst of summer noon her sweet voice was:<br> "Ah, me! what knows this place of changing mind<br> Of men or gods; here shall long ages pass,<br> And clean forget thy feet upon the grass, <a name="page_18"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 18</font></a><br> Thy hapless bones amid the fruitful mould;<br> Look at thy death envenomed swift and cold!"</p>  
 <p>   Hiding new flowers, the dull coils, as she spake,<br> Moved near her limbs: but then the second one,<br> In such a voice as when the morn doth wake<br> To song of birds, said, "When the world foredone<br> Has moaned its last, still shall we dwell alone<br> Beneath this bough, and have no tales to tell<br> Of things deemed great that on the earth befell."</p>  
 <p>   Then spake the third, in voice as of the flute<br> That wakes the maiden to her wedding morn:<br> "If any god should gain our golden fruit,<br> Its curse would make his deathless life forlorn.<br> Lament thou, then, that ever thou wert born;<br> Yet all things, changed by joy or loss or pain,<br> To what they were shall change and change again."</p>  
 <p>   "So be it," he said, "the Fates that drive me on<br> Shall slay me or shall save; blessing or curse<br> That followeth after when the thing is won<br> Shall make my work no better now nor worse;<br> And if it be that the world's heart must nurse<br> Hatred against me, how then shall I choose<br> To leave or take?let your dread servant loose!"</p>  
 <p>Een therewith, like a pillar of black smoke,<br> Swift, shifting ever, drave the worm at him; <a name="page_19"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 19</font></a><br> In deadly silence now that nothing broke,<br> Its folds were writhing round him trunk and limb,<br> Until his glittering gear was nought but dim<br> Een in that sunshine, while his head and side<br> And breast the fork-tongued, pointed muzzle tried.</p>  
 <p>   Closer the coils drew, quicker all about<br> The forked tongue darted, and yet stiff he stood,<br> Een as an oak that sees the straw flare out<br> And lick its ancient bole for little good:<br> Until the godlike fury of his mood<br> Burst from his heart in one great shattering cry,<br> And rattling down the loosened coils did lie;</p>  
 <p>   And from the torn throat and crushed dreadful head<br> Forth flowed a stream of blood along the grass;<br> Bright in the sun he stood above the dead,<br> Panting with fury; yet as ever was<br> The wont of him, soon did his anger pass,<br> And with a happy smile at last he turned<br> To where the apples oer the water burned.</p>  
 <p>   Silent and moveless ever stood the three;<br> No change came oer their faces, as his hand<br> Was stretched aloft unto the sacred tree;<br> Nor shrank they aught aback, though he did stand<br> So close that tresses of their bright hair, fanned<br> By the sweet garden breeze, lay light on him,<br> And his gold fell brushed by them breast and limb. <a name="page_20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 20</font></a></p>  
 <p>   He drew adown the wind-stirred bough, and took<br> The apples thence; then let it spring away,<br> And from his brow the dark hair backward shook,<br> And said: "O sweet, O fair, and shall this day<br> A curse upon my life henceforward lay<br> This day alone? Methinks of coming life<br> Somewhat I know, with all its loss and strife.</p>  
 <p>   "But this I know, at least: the world shall wend<br> Upon its way, and, gathering joy and grief<br> And deeds done, bear them with it to the end;<br> So shall it, though I lie as last year's leaf<br> Lies neath a summer tree, at least receive<br> My life gone by, and store it, with the gain<br> That men alive call striving, wrong, and pain.</p>  
 <p>   "So for my part I rather bless than curse,<br> And bless this fateful land; good be with it;<br> Nor for this deadly thing's death is it worse,<br> Nor for the lack of gold; still shall ye sit<br> Watching the swallow oer the daisies flit;<br> Still shall your wandering limbs ere day is done<br> Make dawn desired by the sinking sun.</p>  
 <p>   "And now, behold! in memory of all this<br> Take ye this girdle that shall waste and fade<br> As fadeth not your fairness and your bliss,<br> That when hereafter mid the blossoms laid<br> Ye talk of days and men now nothing made, <a name="page_21"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 21</font></a><br> Ye may remember how the Theban man,<br> The son of Jove, came oer the waters wan."</p>  
 <p>   Their faces changed not aught for all they heard;<br> As though all things now fully told out were,<br> They gazed upon him without any word:<br> Ah! craving kindness, hope, or loving care,<br> Their fairness scarcely could have made more fair,<br> As with the apples folded in his fell<br> He went, to do more deeds for folk to tell.</p>  
 <p>   Now as the girdle on the ground was cast<br> Those fellows turned and hurried toward the door,<br> And as across its broken leaves they passed<br> The old man saw they not, een as before;<br> But an unearthed blind mole bewildered sore<br> Was wandering there in fruitless, aimless wise,<br> That got small heed from their full-sated eyes.</p>  
 <p>   Swift gat they to their anxious folk; nor had<br> More time than just to say, "Be of good cheer,<br> For in our own land may we yet be glad,"<br> When they beheld the guests a-drawing near;<br> And much bewildered the two fellows were<br> To see the old man, and must even deem<br> That they should see things stranger than a dream.</p>  
 <p>   But when they were aboard the elder cried,<br> "Up sails, my masters, fair now is the wind; <a name="page_22"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 22</font></a><br> Nor good it is too long here to abide,<br> Lest what ye may not loose your souls should bind."<br> And as he spake, the tall trees left behind<br> Stirred with the rising land-wind, and the crew,<br> Joyous thereat, the hawsers shipward drew.</p>  
 <p>   Swift sped the ship, and glad at heart were all,<br> And the Strong Man was merry with the rest,<br> And from the elder's lips no word did fall<br> That did not seem to promise all the best;<br> Yet with a certain awe were men oppressed,<br> And felt as if their inmost hearts were bare,<br> And each man's secret babbled through the air.</p>  
 <p>   Still oft the old man sat with them and told<br> Tales of past time, as on the outward way;<br> And now would they the face of him behold<br> And deem it changed; the years that on him lay<br> Seemed to grow nought, and no more wan and grey<br> He looked, but ever glorious, wise and strong,<br> As though no lapse of time for him were long.</p>  
 <p>   At last, when six days through the kindly sea<br> Their keel had slipped, he said: "Come hearken now,<br> For so it is that things fare wondrously<br> Een in these days; and I a tale can show<br> That, told by you unto your sons shall grow<br> A marvel of the days that are to come:<br> Take heed and tell it when ye reach your home. <a name="page_23"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 23</font></a></p>  
 <p>   "Yet living in the world a man there is<br> Men call the Theban King Amphitryon's son,<br> Although perchance a greater sire was his;<br> But certainly his lips have hung upon<br> Alcmena's breasts: great deeds this man hath won<br> Already, for his name is Hercules,<br> And een ye Asian folk have heard of these.</p>  
 <p>   "Now ere the moon, this eve in his last wane,<br> Was born, this Hercules, the fated thrall<br> Of King Eurystheus, was straight bid to gain .<br> Gifts from a land whereon no foot doth fall<br> Of mortal man, beyond the misty wall<br> Of unknown waters; pensively he went<br> Along the sea on his hard life intent.</p>  
 <p>   "And at the dawn he came into a bay<br> Where the sea, ebbed far down, left wastes of sand,<br> Walled from the green earth by great cliffs and grey;<br> Then he looked up, and wondering there did stand,<br> For strange things lay in slumber on the strand;<br> Strange counterparts of what the firm earth hath<br> Lay scattered all about his weary path:</p>  
 <p>   "Sea-lions and sea-horses and sea-kine,<br> Sea-boars, sea-men strange-skinned, of wondrous hair;<br> And in their midst a man who seemed divine<br> For changeless eld, and round him women fair,<br> Clad in the sea-webs glassy green and clear, <a name="page_24"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 24</font></a><br> With gems on head and girdle, limb and breast,<br> Such as earth knoweth not among her best.</p>  
 <p>   "A moment at the fair and wondrous sight<br> He stared, then, since the heart in him was good,<br> He went about with careful steps and light<br> Till oer the sleeping sea-god now he stood;<br> And if the white-foot maids had stirred his blood<br> As he passed by, now other thoughts had place<br> Within his heart when he beheld that face.</p>  
 <p>   "For Nereus now he knew, who knows all things;<br> And to himself he said, 'If I prevail,<br> Better than by some god-wrought eagle-wings<br> Shall I be holpen;' then he cried out: 'Hail,<br> O Nereus! lord of shifting hill and dale!<br> Arise and wrestle; I am Hercules!<br> Not soon now shalt thou meet the ridgy seas.'</p>  
 <p>   "And mightily he cast himself on him;<br> And Nereus cried out shrilly; and straightway<br> That sleeping crowd, fair maid with half-hid limb,<br> Strange man and green-haired beast, made no delay,<br> But glided down into the billows grey,<br> .And, by the lovely sea embraced, were gone,<br> While they two wrestled on the sea strand lone.</p>  
 <p>   "Soon found the sea-god that his bodily might<br> Was nought in dealing with Jove's dear one there; <a name="page_25"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 25</font></a><br> And soon he gan to use his magic sleight:<br> Into a lithe leopard, and a hugging bear<br> He turned him; then the smallest fowl of air<br> The straining arms of Hercules must hold,<br> And then a mud-born wriggling eel and cold.</p>  
 <p>   "Then as the firm hands mastered this, forth brake<br> A sudden rush of waters all around,<br> Blinding and choking: then a thin green snake<br> With golden eyes; then oer the shell-strewn ground<br> Forth stole a fly the least that may be found;<br> Then earth and heaven seemed wrapped in one huge flame,<br> But from the midst thereof a voice there came:</p>  
 <p>   "'Kinsman and stout-heart, thou hast won the day,<br> Nor to my grief: what wouldst thou have of me?'<br> And therewith to an old man small and grey<br> Faded the roaring flame, who wearily<br> Sat down upon the sand and said, 'Let be!<br> I know thy tale; worthy of help thou art;<br> Come now, a short way hence will there depart</p>  
 <p>   "'A ship of Tyre for the warm southern seas,<br> Come we a-board; according to my will<br> Her way shall be.' Then up rose Hercules,<br> Merry of face, though hot and panting still;<br> But the fair summer day his heart did fill <a name="page_26"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 26</font></a><br> With all delight; and so forth went the twain,<br> And found those men desirous of all gain.</p>  
 <p>   "Ah, for these gainful mensomewhat indeed<br> Their sails are rent, their bark beat; kin and friend<br> Are wearying for them; yet a friend in need<br> They yet shall gain, if at their journey's end,<br> Upon the last ness where the wild goats wend<br> To lick the salt-washed stones, a house they raise<br> Bedight with gold in kindly Nereus praise."</p>  
 <p>   Breathless they waited for these latest words,<br> That like the soft wind of the gathering night<br> Were grown to be: about the mast flew birds<br> Making their moan, hovering long-winged and white;<br> And now before their straining anxious sight<br> The old man faded out into the air,<br> And from his place flew forth a sea-mew fair.</p>  
 <p>   Then to the Mighty Man, Alcmena's son,<br> With yearning hearts they turned till he should speak,<br> And he spake softly: "Nought ill have ye done<br> In helping me to find what I did seek:<br> The world made better by me knows if weak<br> My hand and heart are: but now, light the fire<br> Upon the prow and worship the grey sire."</p>  
 <p>   So did they; and such gifts as there they had<br> Gave unto Nereus; yea, and sooth to say, <a name="page_27"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 27</font></a><br> Amid the tumult of their hearts made glad,<br> Had honoured Hercules in een such way;<br> But he laughed out amid them, and said, "Nay,<br> Not yet the end is come; nor have I yet<br> Bowed down before vain longing and regret.</p>  
 <p>   "It may bewho shall tell, when I go back<br> There whence I came, and looking down behold<br> The place that my once eager heart shall lack,<br> And all my dead desires a-lying cold,<br> But I may have the might then to enfold<br> The hopes of brave men in my heart?but long<br> Life lies before first with its change and wrong."</p>  
 <p>   So fair along the watery ways they sped<br> In happy wise, nor failed of their return;<br> Nor failed in ancient Tyre the ways to tread,<br> Teaching their tale to whomsoeer would learn,<br> Nor failed at last the flesh of beasts to burn<br> In Nereus house, turned toward the bright day's end<br> On the last ness, round which the wild goats wend. <a name="page_28"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 28</font></a></p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p>HE made an end, and gazed about the place,<br> With rest enow upon his ancient face,<br> And smiling; but to some the tale did seem<br> Like to the middle of some pleasant dream,<br> Which, waked from, leaves upon the troubled mind<br> A sense of something ill that lurked behind,<br> If morn had given due time to dream it out.</p>  
 <p>   Yet as the women stirred, and went about<br> The board with flask and beaker, and the scent<br> Of their soft raiment mid the feasters went,<br> The hill-side sun of autumn-tide at least<br> Seemed to come back unto their winter feast;<br> Rest, half remembering time past, did they win,<br> And somewhat surely wrought the tale therein. <a name="page_29"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 29</font></a></p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p>IN late December shone the westering sun<br> Through frosty haze of the day nearly done,<br> Without the hall wherein our elders were:<br> Within, the firelight gleamed on raiment fair,<br> And heads far fairer; because youth and maid<br> Midwinter words of hope that day had said<br> Before the altars; and were come at last,<br> No worse for snowy footways over-past,<br> Or for the east wind upon cheek and brow,<br> Their fairness to the ancient folk to show;<br> And, dance and song being done, at end of day,<br> With ears pricked up, amid the furs they lay,<br> To have reward of tale for sound and sight<br> So given erewhile.<br>                      The flickering firelight,<br> And the late sun still streaming through the haze,<br> Made the hall meet enow for tale of days<br> So long past over: nigh the cheery flame<br> A wanderer sat, and a long sunbeam came<br> On to his knees, then to the hearth fell down.<br> There in the silence, with thin hands and brown<br> Folded together, and a dying smile<br> Upon his face, he sat a little while,<br> Then somewhat raised his bright eyes, and began<br> To name his people's best beloved man.</p>
