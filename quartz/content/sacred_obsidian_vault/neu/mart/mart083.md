 CHAPTER XXIII
 
 How Sir Pelleas loved no more Ettard by means of the
 Damosel of the Lake, whom he loved ever after.
 
 SIR KNIGHT PELLEAS, said the Damosel of the Lake, take your horse
 and come forth with me out of this country, and ye shall love a
 lady that shall love you.  I will well, said Sir Pelleas, for
 this Lady Ettard hath done me great despite and shame, and there
 he told her the beginning and ending, and how he had purposed
 never to have arisen till that he had been dead.  And now such
 grace God hath sent me, that I hate her as much as ever I loved
 her, thanked be our Lord Jesus!  Thank me, said the Damosel of
 the Lake.  Anon Sir Pelleas armed him, and took his horse, and
 commanded his men to bring after his pavilions and his stuff
 where the Damosel of the Lake would assign.  So the Lady Ettard
 died for sorrow, and the Damosel of the Lake rejoiced Sir
 Pelleas, and loved together during their life days.
