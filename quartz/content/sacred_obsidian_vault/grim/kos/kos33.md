 <p align="CENTER">______________________</p>
 <p>Figure 42.--The Fourth Pentacle of Venus.--It is of great power, since it compels the Spirits of Venus to obey, and to force on the instant any person thou wishest to come unto thee.</p>
 <i></i><p>Editor's Note.--At the four Angles of the Figure are the four letters of the Name IHVH. The other letters form the Names of Spirits of Venus, e.g.:--Schii, Eli, Ayib, etc. The versicle is from Genesis ii. 23, 24:--'This is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. And they two were one flesh.'</p>
 <p align="CENTER">______________________</p>
 <p>Figure 43.--The Fifth and last Pentacle of Venus.--When it is only showed unto any person soever, it inciteth and exciteth wonderfully unto love.</p>
 <i></i><p>Editor's Note.--Around the central Square arc the Names Elohim, El Gebil, and two other Names which I cannot decipher, and have, therefore, given them as they stand. The characters are those of the 'Passing of the River.' The surrounding versicle is from Psalm xxii. 14:--'My heart is like wax, it is melted in the midst of my bowels.'</p>

 <p>Figure 44.--The First Pentacle of Mercury.--It serveth to invoke the Spirits who are under the Firmament.</p>
 <i></i><p>Editor's Note.--Letters forming the Names of the Spirits Yekahel and Agiel.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">______________________</p>
 <p>Figure 45.--The Second Pentacle of Mercury.--The Spirits herein written serve to bring to effect and to grant things which are contrary unto the order of Nature; and which are not contained under any other head. They easily give answer, but they can with difficulty be seen.</p>
