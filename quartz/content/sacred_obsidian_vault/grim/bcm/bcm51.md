 <h1 align="CENTER">CHAPTER III</h1>
 <h2 align="CENTER">Concerning the Descending Hierarchy</h2>
 <h3 align="CENTER">§ 1. The Names and Offices of Evil Spirits</h3>
 <p>IN all matters of ceremonial the inspiration of the Grimoires must be sought in the <i>Key of Solomon</i> proper, but for the names and offices of the demons it must be sought in the <i>Lesser Key</i>. The hierarchy, according to the <i>Lemegeton</i>, with its accompanying evoking processes, will be given in the fourth chapter, as there is no special reason for separating it from the practical context. I shall therefore deal in this place with the simpler though later summaries, which will prevent these curious issues from being confused.</p>
 <p>The <i>Book of True Black Magic</i>, like its prototype the original <i>Clavicle</i>, gives no account of the nature of the Spirits with which it professes to deal, and, as already seen, it breaks off abruptly at the point where the conjuring formulae should follow to complete the work. This <i>Secret of Secrets</i>, as the Grimoires term the methods for raising and discharging spirits, being omitted, it may now be dismissed from consideration till we come to the minor processes of Ceremonial Magic, chiefly venereal and fantastic, which are grouped in the eighth chapter.</p>
 <p>The <i>Grimoire of Honorius</i> mentions by name four kings, referred to the cardinal points, and seven lesser spirits to be invoked on the days of the week, but as will appear later on, there is no explicit notice of the Descending Hierarchy. These</p>
 <p><a name="page_185"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 185</font></a></p>
 <p>deficiencies are supplied by the <i>Grimorium Verum</i> and the <i>Grand Grimoire</i>.</p>

 <p>As regards spirits, says the former, some are superior and others inferior. The three superior are Lucifer, Beelzebuth and Astaroth. According to the latter, Lucifer is Emperor; Beelzebuth, Prince; and Astaroth, Grand Duke. They must be invoked by means of the characters which they themselves have made known, and these characters must be written with the blood of the operator, or with that of a sea-tortoise. Failing this, they may be engraved on an emerald or ruby, for both these stones have great sympathy with spirits, especially with those of the solar race, who are wiser,</p>
 <p><a name="page_186"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 186</font></a></p>
 <p>better and more friendly than the rest. <a name="fr_159"></a><a href="#fn_158"><font size="1">1</font></a> The character must be worn upon the person; in the case of a male, it should be placed in the right pocket, but a female must carry it between the breasts, towards the left side, like a reliquary. It should be graven or written on the day and in the hour of Mars for both sexes, and apparently in the case of each of the three spirits.</p>
 <p>The lord commands the servants, so the Grimoire proceeds, and these three spirits can do all things. But the operator is advised that he shall obey those who obey him, because the exalted and powerful spirits serve only their confidants and intimate friends. He is further grimly warned to keep upon his guard lest any spirit should seize him unawares. Each of the rulers has two chief officers, who announce to the subjects all things which their lord hath commanded throughout the world, and ordain all that is to be done. The inferiors of Lucifer are <i>Put Satanachia</i> and <i>Agaliarept</i>; they inhabit Europe and Asia. Those of Beelzebuth are <i>Tarchimache</i> and <i>Fleurety</i>; they dwell in Africa. Those of Astaroth are <i>Sargatanas</i> and <i>Nebiros</i>, whose asylum is America, so that this kind of Magic is presumably post-Columbian.</p>
 <p>The <i>Grand Grimoire</i> does not distribute the six subordinate spirits among three rulers, but enumerates them somewhat differently, together with their dignities, as follows: <a name="fr_160"></a><a href="#fn_159"><font size="1">2</font></a>--</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_187"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 187</font></a></p>
 <p>LUCIFUGE ROFOCALE.--Prime Minister.</p>
 <p>SATANACHIA.--Commander-in-Chief.</p>
 <p>AGALIAREPT.--Another Commander.</p>
 <p>FLEURETY.--Lieutenant-General.</p>
 <p>SARGATANAS.--Brigadier-Major.</p>
 <p>NEBIROS.--Field-Marshal and Inspector-General.</p>
 <p>It will be seen that the principalities of Infernus are chiefly represented in the light of a standing army, yet their interference in earthly matters is not of a military kind. LUCIFUGE ROFOCALE has the control, with which Lucifer has invested him, over all the wealth and treasures of the world. His subordinates are <i>Baal</i>, <a name="fr_161"></a><a href="#fn_160"><font size="1">1</font></a> <i>Agares</i> <a name="fr_162"></a><a href="#fn_161"><font size="1">2</font></a> and Marbas. <a name="fr_163"></a><a href="#fn_162"><font size="1">3</font></a> The grand SATANACHIA has the power of subjecting all wives and maidens to his wishes, and of doing with them as he wills. His subordinates are <i>Pruslas</i>, <i>Aamon</i> <a name="fr_164"></a><a href="#fn_163"><font size="1">4</font></a> and <i>Barbatos</i>. <a name="fr_165"></a><a href="#fn_164"><font size="1">5</font></a> AGALIAREPT has the faculty of discovering arcane secrets in all the courts and council-chambers of the world; he also unveils the most sublime mysteries. He commands the Second Legion of Spirits, and his subordinates are <i>Buer</i>, <a name="fr_166"></a><a href="#fn_165"><font size="1">6</font></a> <i>Gusoyn</i> <a name="fr_167"></a><a href="#fn_166"><font size="1">7</font></a> and <i>Botis</i>. <a name="fr_168"></a><a href="#fn_167"><font size="1">8</font></a> FLEURETY has the power to perform any labour during the night and to cause hailstones</p>

 <p>in any required place. He controls a prodigious army of spirits, and has <i>Bathsin</i> <a name="fr_169"></a><a href="#fn_168"><font size="1">1</font></a> (or <i>Bathim</i>), <i>Pursan</i> and <i>Eligor</i> <a name="fr_170"></a><a href="#fn_169"><font size="1">2</font></a> as his subordinates. SARGATANAS has the power to make any person invisible, to transport him anywhere, to open all locks, to reveal whatsoever is taking place in private houses, to teach all the arts of the shepherds. He commands several Brigades of Spirits, and has <i>Zoray</i>, <i>Valefar</i> and <i>Faraii</i> for his immediate inferiors. NEBIROS has the power to inflict evil on whomsoever he will; he discovers the Hand of Glory and reveals every virtue of metals, minerals, vegetables, as also of all animals, both pure and impure. He possesses the art of predicting things to come, being one of the greatest Necromancers in all the Infernal Hierarchies; he goes to and fro everywhere and inspects the hordes of perdition. His immediate subordinates are <i>Ayperos</i>, <i>Naberrs</i> and <i>Glassyalabolas</i>.</p>
 <p>It is added that there are millions of other spirits in subjection to those which have been mentioned, but their enumeration serves no purpose, as they are required only when it pleases the superiors to employ them in their own place, for the latter make use of all the inferior Intelligences like workmen or slaves.</p>
 <p>The <i>Grimorium Verum</i>, however, mentions seventeen of the most important subordinate spirits, who seem to correspond with the ministers of the six great leaders mentioned above, but there is little unanimity among makers of magical rituals, whether white or black.</p>

 <font size="2">CHARACTER OF HUICTIIGARA</font></p>
 <p>HUICTIIGARA occasions sleep and waking in some, and afflicts others with insomnia.</p>
 <p>SATANACHIA and SATANICÆ govern forty-five, or, as some say, fifty-four demons, four of whom are <i>Sergutthy, Heramael, Trimasel</i> and <i>Sustugriel</i>. Two of these rank as chief. The rest are of no great importance.</p>
 <p>These are serviceable spirits, who act easily and quickly, provided that they are content with the operator. <i>Sergutthy</i> has power over wives and virgins, when the occasion is favourable. <i>Heramael</i> teaches the art of medicine, gives absolute knowledge of all diseases, with their full and radical cure, makes known all plants in general, the places where they grow, the times of their gathering, their virtues also and their composition for the attainment of a perfect cure. <i>Trimasel</i> teaches chemistry and all sleight of hand. He imparts the</p>
 <p><a name="page_193"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 193</font></a></p>
 <p>true secret for confecting the powder of projection which changes imperfect metals--lead, iron, pewter, copper and quicksilver--into true good silver and good gold, namely, Sun and Moon, according to the ferment thereof. Only he must be satisfied with the operator, if the operator would be satisfied with him. <i>Sustugriel</i> teaches magical art; he gives familiar spirits for all things that can be desired, and furnishes mandragores.</p>
 <i></i><p>Agalierept and <i>Tarihimal</i> govern <i>Elelogap</i>, whose power is over water. The two <i>Nebirots</i> rule <i>Hael</i> and <i>Sergulath</i>. <i>Hael</i> instructs in the art of writing all kinds of letters, gives an immediate power of speaking all kinds of tongues and explains the most secret things. <i>Sergulath</i> furnishes every manner of speculation, teaches tactics and the breaking of hostile ranks. They have eight powerful inferiors. 1. <i>Proculo</i>, who gives sleep for twenty-four hours, with knowledge of the spheres of sleep. 2. <i>Haristum</i>, who gives the power of passing unsinged through the fire. 3. <i>Brulefer</i>, who makes one loved by women. 4. <i>Pentagonony</i>, who renders invisible and also beloved by great lords. 5. <i>Aglasis</i>, who transports through the whole world. 6. <i>Sidrargrosam</i>, who makes girls dance stark naked, 7. <i>Minoson</i>, who insures winning in all games. 8. <i>Bucon</i>, who has the power to excite hatred and jealousy between the two sexes.</p>
