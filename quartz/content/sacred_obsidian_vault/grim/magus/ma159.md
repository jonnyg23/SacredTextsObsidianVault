 <p>clothed with garments of a saffron colour, riding upon an eagle or dragon, having in his right hand a dart, about, as it were, to strike it into the head of the same eagle or dragon.

They made, also, another image of Jupiter, for a religious and glorious life, and advancement of fortune; whose figure was a man having the head of a lion or a ram, and eagle's feet, and clothed in saffron coloured clothes.</p>
