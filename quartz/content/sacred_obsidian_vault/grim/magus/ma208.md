 <font size="4"><p align="CENTER">CHAP. VII.</p>
 </font><font size="2"><p align="CENTER">OF THE VITAL SPIRIT, &amp;c</p></font>.
 <p>THE vital spirit in the flesh and blood performs the office of the soul; that is, it is the same spirit in the outward man, which, in the seed, forms the whole figure, that magnificent structure and perfect delineation of man, and which hath known the ends of things to be done, because it contains them; and the which as president accompanies the new framed young, even unto the period of its life; and the which, although it depart therewith, some smacks or small quantity, at least, thereof remains in a carcass slain by, violence, being as it were most exactly co-fermented with the same. But, from a dead carcass that was extinct of its own accord, and from nature failing, as well the implanted as inflowing spirit passed forth at once.</p>
 <p><a name="page_21"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 21</font></a></p>
 <p>For which reason, physicians divide this spirit into the implanted or mummial, and inflowing or acquired spirit, which departs; to wit, with the former life and this influxing spirit they afterwards subdivide into the natural, vital, and animal spirit; but, we likewise, do here comprehend them all at once in one single word.</p>
 <p>The soul therefore being wholly a spirit could never move or stir up the vital spirit, (being indeed corporeal), much less flesh and bones, unless a certain natural power, yet magical and spiritual, did descend from the soul into the spirit and body.</p>
 <p>After what sort, I pray, could the corporeal spirit obey the commands of the soul, unless there should be a command from her for moving of the spirit, and afterwards the body?</p>
 <p>But against this magical motive faculty thou will forthwith object, that that power is limited within her composed body, and her own natural inn: therefore although we call this soul a magicianness, yet it shall be only a wresting and abuse of the name; for truly the true and superstitious magic draws not its foundation from the soul; seeing this same soul is not able to move, alter, or exite any thing out of its own body.</p>
 <p>I answer, that this power, and that natural magic of the soul which she exerciseth not of herself, by virtue of the image of God, doth now lie hid as obscure in man, and as it were lie asleep since the fall or corruption of Adam, and stands in need or stirring up; all which particulars we shall anon in their proper place prove; which same power, how drowsy and as it were drunk soever, it otherwise remains daily in us, yet it is sufficient to perform its offices in its own body.</p>
