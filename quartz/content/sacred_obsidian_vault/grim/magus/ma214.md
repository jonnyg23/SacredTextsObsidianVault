 <font size="2"><p align="CENTER">WHAT DIGNITY AND PREPARATION IS ESSENTIALLY NECESSARY TO HIM WHO WOULD BECOME A TRUE MAGICIAN</p></font>.
 <p>IT is fit that we who endeavour to attain so great a height should first study two things: <i>viz.</i> First, how we should leave vain and carnal affections, frail sense and material passions; Secondly, by what ways and means we may ascend to an intellect pure, and joined with the powers of the celestials, without which we shall never happily ascend to the scrutiny of secret things, and to the power of working wonderful effects, &amp;c. Now, if thou art a man perfect in thy understanding, and constantly meditating upon what we have in this book written, and without doubting, believeth, thou shalt be able, by praying, consecrating, deprecating, invocating, &amp;c. to attract spiritual and celestial gifts, and to imprint them on whatever things thou shalt please; and by it to vivify every magical work.</p>
