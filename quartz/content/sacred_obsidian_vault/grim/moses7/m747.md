 <h3 align="CENTER">The Vestibule of Entrance</h3>
 <p>The language and manuscript of this rare and eternal monument of light, and of a higher wisdom, are borrowed from the Cuthans, a tribe of the Samaritans, who were called Cuthim in the Chaldee dialect according to the Talmud, and they were so called in a spirit of derision. They were termed sorcerers because they taught in Cutha, their original place of abode, and afterward in Samaria, the Kabala or Higher Magic (Book of Kings). Caspar, Melchior and Balthazar, the chosen archpriests, are shining lights among the Eastern magicians. They were kings and teachers--the first priest-teachers of this glorious knowledge--and from these Samaritans-Cuthans, who were called Nergal according to the traditions of the Talmud, originated the Gypsies, who, through degeneracy, lost the consecration of their primordial powers.</p>
